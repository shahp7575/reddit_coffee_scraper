1lrs7tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/RodriguesFamilySnark/comments/1lrs7tx/chapter_9_serenas_serenity_the_amazing_offer_and/,Chapter 9: Serena's Serenity: The Amazing Offer and Decision,"Happy Fourth, Snarkers! (sort of! Currently feeling a little weird about being all screaming eagles and bottle rockets while wondering if my father, who is currently a man who lives 95% of his life in an electronic recliner, is now going to have to take on a second career as, I don't know what, a human throw pillow? This man CAN'T WALK and we are in the planning stages for a leg funeral).  Anyway, I'm here to clutter up your feed with another one of my self-serving posts, ready to just scream into the void, similar to Serena!

Just kidding, Serena would never scream. It's against everything she stands for. We find her in the car (again) with Jerusha. At this point, Jerusha Seinfeld might as well have her own Coffee and Cars situation. Anyway, the big news Carl had for Serena that topped the ottoman, milkshake and TV/DVD combo on that ""joyful mystery"" of an evening was that Carl has a friend from work that will drive him home some days, so Serena doesn't have to carpool each morning and night, only sometimes! What a piece of news!!! But then, if you have ever been without a car, like I was when my Hyundai engine shit the bed and they were fixing it and they were like, we will have this to you sometime in the year of our Lord 2065, you do know that that is probably a big deal, so I will cosign this little win for her. 

Jerusha drops her at The Huffs (which sounds like a rejected mansion name in Newport, RI) and she is met at the door by Miss Emili and Blaire and Claire, who are yelling at her ""Please say yes! We want you to live with us!"" This is a real departure from Miss Emili thinking she kidnapped her children. 

Miss Emili goes on to say that her and her husband have been discussing Serena's ""pitiful situation"" (ouch) and they've decided that ""her loss might be their gain."" Yee-ikes, MIss Emili does not work at the candy factory, she is not a sugar coater! She goes on to say the girls have been thriving under Serena's tutelage and she wants her to consider living in the guest suite with Carl and homeschooling the girls next year....Miss Emili, no!!! That is a bad Miss Emili. Homeschooling is never the answer (author's note: my ex was homeschooled...that's a book in and of itself...). 

Serena is iffy on it, which is the first sense she's shown...she's not really trying to live with Blaire and Claire full time and she tries to beg off, but Miss Emili is a financially experienced Queen and she says there is no rush to decide-if Serena says no, she'll just send them to PRIVATE SCHOOL, which is better than the hell of PUBLIC SCHOOL, but basically just a step above letting Blair and Claire busk for coins on the subway. Miss Emili hurries off to her job with a promise to talk more and suggests the girls show her the quarters that she and Carl would be occupying. 

Serena was not into until she saw the room-which was beautiful and not at all like the ""stale smell of old carpets and rotting cupboards in the apartment."" But if we remember, Serena was living in a house that apparently blew up and didn't have running water for a time, so should we be trusting her judgement? Serena has a lot of ""unserene"" thoughts about her shitty apartment as she lets herself tour the suite-it smells like OLD TOBACCO SMOKE and PROBABLY ANIMAL DANDER, along with mold. Serena had had to scrub the entire place down with bleach before she could even step foot in there. She literally had not ever lived anywhere as shitty, not even the old house. 

Serena lets herself be taken in by the gorgeous ARTIFICIAL FERNS and down bedspread that may or may not aggravate Serena's allergies and asthma...oh, sorry, did you fall asleep ? There are like 3 pages of descriptions of various rooms in what apparently is another entire house at The Huffs, and Serena has a lot of thoughts about what may or may not set off her allergies or asthma, which is is pretty rich for someone who was losing their shit about a blow up footstool the other day. 

The twins ask Serena if she is going to take this incredible offer and she says she will have to talk it over with her husband- until then she needs to get to work to show Miss Emili she is the best worker that she can be. 

We flash forward a month in the timeline when Serena and Carl's lease expired-what exciting things we must have missed in that time! What characters will we never know? It's hard to say, because we are now in the back of ""a store"" waiting for an employee to bring out some ""egg boxes"" for packing and now I find myself wondering if Serena and Carl are waiting for boxes that held eggs specifically because of some dimensions, or if shes talking about egg cartons, in which case I cannot believe anyone is wasting time doing that. When I move I start out strong and then end up throwing like, a porcelain statue, and old belt and cleaning supplies in one box and calling it done. 

This downtime was a mistake, because now that Serena has had a second to herself, she sees a box of candy canes, and it is inspires her...to tell Carl she's just been dying to go out...to annoy her neighbors and friends with her testimony, right in the time for the holidays! And you know what is better than handing out just tracts? Tracts with candy canes attached (take note, Jill and David, these are the types of ideas you need to be writing down).  Serena asks Carl if she can buy a box of candy canes and Carl really mulls it over-is it going to look weird to give the neighbors a box of candy canes? And then Serena says...oh did you nod off again? yeah, we have a lot of description here about what Serena wants to do with the candycanes, specifically tie them in ribbon in bundles, and Jesus Serena, ribbon and candy canes? Are you trying to force Carl into more debt? He's still trying to pay off that milkshake! He's up to his eyeballs in shit here!

A man comes out with the free boxes and for his trouble he gets a tract and a candy cane, and a lecture from Serena and Carl about how they've never regressed their personal decision to accept Jesus' forgiveness. As you can see, things are going really well for them, they even just took out a loan to a box of candy canes. The man is like, thanks so much for this paper and have a great move. 

Serena goes back into the store to get her 'canes and ribbon and finds some time to make an old woman feel awkward while telling her about Jesus and Allegra-in fact, as she leaves, she tells Carl and Serena that they should be glad the manager isn't here-he doesn't allow soliciting, to which Serena claps back that they aren't even selling anything, they are OFFERING her a FREE paper BECAUSE THEY CARE, you UNGRATEFUL old sow. 

""Why are people so uncaring about those who have died and even about their own futures?"" Serena wondered to Carl, and Carl just makes up an answer because he's used to his wife's continual unanswerable questions. Serena thanks Carl and says she is lucky that God counted her worthy to work through difficult times with him.  Thanks God, I guess you were just doing me a favor when You made Carl miss that insurance payment and then allowed our house to blow up. It was all a big lesson!

This gives Serena a BIG IDEA (this is interesting in light of the 'Rods!) Serena decides they should go to the library and make their own tracts, featuring their sad story about Allegra! Carl looks at his watch and is like, holy shit the library is still open !! Lets hit the road. 

PSA: Do not print your tracts at the library. Print them in your tax deductible print shop ministry where your kids can fold them and possibly get their hair sucked into a press at the same time. This is probably the nicest thing the Rods do. 

Serena is torn though, because she's jazzed to get home and Carl immediately says HE will go to the library and whip something up tomorrow. Carl is going to design the tract? Sounds a little...I don't know...gay, Carl! Men don't know how to do art! Or is he just trying to co-opt Serena's idea for the eternal glory. 

Serena and Carl go home and then she calls her mom, who tells her she did a GREAT Job cleaning up those trash dolls Blair and Claire didn't want for Joelle and Brookelle. She didn't even TELL them that Serena fished them out of the trash for them (which, why would you ? Also, she definitely did)

Serena's kids ask if they are rich yet so they can come and live with her again, and the answer is no, these two are going to need you to go to work to make the next balloon payment on her blow up footstool. 

When they hang up, Carl approaches Serena and says he's been struggling. WE FUCKING KNOW CARL. He's not sure he wants to move and so at work, he read his Bible during his lunch break and prayed. Between this and the tracts and the constant bumming of rides, he must be a really fun co worker. Anyway, Carl was reading and praying and then he remembered Serena put a Bible CD in his lunch box a while ago! Totally normal! this must be why I don't have a husband anymore. I didn't do enough cute things like put a Bible CD (???) in his lunch box for him to carry around, I guess, and get scratched up by a filthy old melted ice pack and covered in a rotting banana. I'm writing it down for next time, maybe. 

After Carl finished his album, he checked his voicemail and it was a message from Serena's dad, asking them to consider moving in so they can save money to get on their feet. I'll say it, Why was this not the plan from the very start? Were they just wanting to unload Brookelle and Joelle for awhile? Was the dad holding out and realized he'd be stuck with them forever if he didn't make some choices. Anyway, Carl was like I thought about it, and he quotes some scripture and that tells Serena they can get the fuck out of Ohio and into the Promised Land, of Upstate NY!

They worry for about one second on what they will do if they leave their jobs, and then quote some scripture to each other, which in Bible-ese seems to mean LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO! Which, this is a good choice, this is what you should have done in the first place, but you had to dick around in Ohio cleaning moldy cupboards and eating ethnic dishes with Jerusha first to get there.

It seems like Serena and Carl are ready to move up and out....first a foot stool, then the candy canes, and now ANOTHER move...life is getting very fast -paced and I hope that I can keep up!

1lrs5nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1lrs5nk/amazon_sde1_new_grad_us/,Amazon SDE-1 New Grad - US,"Hey folks, Just wrapped up my Amazon SDE-1 final rounds recently and wanted to share my experience + get your thoughts on how I did.

**Round 1 (LP + LLD):**  
This one had two LP questions with follow-ups and a Low-Level Design round. The design prompt was “Design a 'X' Shop” (X can be anything like Ice cream, coffee, snacks, etc. Can't share exact question).  
I fumbled a bit here, didn’t clarify requirements properly early on. At the end, the interviewer even admitted that he wasn’t clear enough with the initial ask, but I still feel like that might be a negative signal.  
That said, I was able to design the complete solution. In the end we had a discussion around design choices, why I made certain classes, why I chose specific data structures, etc.

**Round 2 (Bar Raiser):**  
This was a purely LP round — 3 LPs asked with multiple follow-ups.  
It went really well. The interviewer somehow already knew about my most recent internship (which wasn’t on my resume when I applied), which surprised me as he started asking question regarding my recent role and I wasn't prepared to answer questions related to it but I think I did well over there.  
He seemed very engaged, and even mentioned that ""he *learned something new from me today""*. So I think that is a good sign. This round was wrapped up in 40 mins.

**Round 3 (DSA-heavy, no LPs):**  
Interviewer jumped straight into coding by saying ""Let’s not waste time, this will eat into your DSA time"":

Then immediately gave me a Leetcode Hard (Backtracking) problem, then asked me to optimize the solution. Was able to solve the question completely but took me \~40 minutes to solve. Then followed it up with a Leetcode Medium or Hard (idk), Sort a single linked list in O(1) space which I solved and did the dry run in \~15 mins. No LPs were asked (I am not sure if I took more time to solve the problems or it was pre decided to not ask any LPs in this round). We wrapped up this round on time.

Overall, I feel like R2 was Decent, R3 was strong technically but no LPs, and R1 was bit shaky.

**What do you all think are my chances of getting an offer?**  
Has anyone experienced a no-LP round and still got through? Appreciate any insights or similar experiences!",1,1751659749.0,leetcode,0,1.0,False

On my trip to Tokyo I made some time to stop by at X Coffee Ginza, just a short walk from the main shopping district. It has a more contemporary aesthetic than Glitch with a blacked out interior. 

The service was excellent—we were greeted as soon as we walked in the door, and the barista gave us bean recommendations based on the brewing method we chose. As for the coffee, I was very impressed. I got a latte and a pour over and the gf got a pour over, totaling 4800 yen ($33.22 USD). The hibiscus double fermented Colombian beans were a true delicacy. Both pour overs were amazing as well. There were baskets under our seats where we could store our belongings.

The day before this, I did actually go to Glitch at their Jimbocho location. I had high expectations due to the hype on this sub, but I was underwhelmed. I had a latte and the gf had a pour over totaling 4304 yen ($29.79 USD). The latte I had was nothing special and was a bit lacking in flavor. The atmosphere was also lessened by the roasting machine being placed directly in the seating area. It wasn’t necessarily bad, but Glitch just didn’t meet my expectations. One advantage over X coffee however is that Glitch served us water, whereas X did not.

All in all, although Glitch was a good experience, it is a bit overrated in my opinion and I enjoyed X coffee more. ",1,1751659717.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

# Frequently Asked Questions about Budapest travel

# Q: Why is Budapest considered the Pearl of the Danube?

A: Budapest earns this beautiful nickname because of its stunning location straddling the Danube River, with both Buda and Pest sides offering unique architectural beauty and historical significance. The city's illuminated bridges and buildings at night create a particularly enchanting panorama, truly making it shine like a pearl on the river.

# Q: What is the most scenic way to experience Budapest's public transport?

A: For truly picturesque views, hopping on **Tram Line 2** is highly recommended. It runs along the Pest embankment of the Danube, offering fantastic vistas of Buda Castle, the Parliament Building, and the Chain Bridge. It's a great way to sightsee while getting around.

# Q: Are there any specific times of day that are best to visit popular attractions like Buda Castle or Fisherman's Bastion to avoid crowds?

A: To best avoid the heaviest crowds at popular spots like Buda Castle, Fisherman's Bastion, and the Parliament, consider visiting early in the morning right after opening hours, or later in the afternoon before closing. Mid-day, especially during peak tourist season (summer), tends to be the busiest. The complex for Buda Castle is generally open from 10 am to 6 pm, but individual museums and attractions within it may have varying hours.

# Q: What's the recommended way to travel from Budapest Airport to the city centre?

A: The most convenient and popular option is the **100E Airport Express bus**. It offers a direct link from the airport to key city centre stops like Kálvin tér, Astoria, and Deák Ferenc tér, operating frequently throughout the day and night. While it costs a separate special ticket, it's efficient and reasonably priced. Other options include shared airport shuttles or taxis.

# Q: What's the difference between Szechenyi Thermal Bath and Gellért Thermal Bath, and which one should I choose?

A: **Szechenyi Thermal Bath** is the largest and most famous, known for its grand yellow buildings and numerous indoor and outdoor pools, including a large outdoor swimming pool where people play chess. It tends to be more lively and a popular social spot. **Gellért Thermal Bath**, housed within a beautiful Art Nouveau hotel, offers a more opulent and historically grand experience with stunning architecture. The choice often depends on whether you prefer a more bustling, expansive atmosphere (Szechenyi) or a more elegant, perhaps slightly quieter, historical setting (Gellért). To avoid crowds at either, early mornings (before 10 am) and weekdays are generally best.

# Q: Is it easy to find English-speaking staff or guides at attractions and restaurants in Budapest?

A: Yes, in major tourist areas, at popular attractions, and in most restaurants and hotels, you will find staff who speak English. Many tour guides also offer tours specifically in English, and you can easily book these online. While learning a few basic Hungarian phrases (like hello or thank you) is always appreciated, it's generally not essential for navigation in central Budapest.

# Q: Are there any less-known but worthwhile attractions in Budapest that tourists often miss?

A: Beyond the main highlights, consider exploring the **Hospital in the Rock Nuclear Bunker Museum** for a fascinating historical insight, the peaceful **Japanese Garden on Margaret Island**, or the beautiful **Kerepesi Cemetery**, which is like an open-air museum of Hungarian history. For something unique, the **Zugliget Chairlift** offers scenic views up Buda hills.

# Q: What local customs or etiquette should tourists be aware of while visiting Budapest?

A: Hungarians appreciate politeness. When entering shops or cafes, a simple Jó napot (good day) is nice. Tipping around 10-15% is customary in restaurants and for taxi drivers if service is good. On public transport, it's polite to offer your seat to the elderly, pregnant women, or those with disabilities. Remember to **validate your public transport tickets** immediately upon boarding a tram/bus or entering a metro station, as plain-clothes inspectors conduct checks.

# Q: Is Budapest considered a safe city for tourists, including solo female travellers?

A: Yes, Budapest is generally considered a very safe city for tourists, including solo female travellers. It consistently ranks among the safest capitals in Europe. Common sense precautions, such as being aware of your belongings in crowded areas (like on public transport or at major attractions) and avoiding overly intoxicated areas late at night, are always advisable, just as in any large city.

# Q: What's the best way to experience Budapest's famous ruin bars if I'm not looking for an all-night party?

A: If you want to experience the unique atmosphere of the ruin bars without the intense party scene, visit them earlier in the evening, perhaps between 6 PM and 9 PM. Many ruin bars, especially Szimpla Kert, also operate as cafes, cultural spaces, or even markets during the day, offering a much more relaxed vibe to appreciate their quirky decor and unique concept.

# Safety first: Firearm safety and etiquette

Safety is paramount at any reputable shooting facility. Before you even touch a firearm, you’ll receive a thorough briefing on essential safety rules and range etiquette. Adhering to these guidelines is crucial for a safe and enjoyable experience.

# Fundamental safety rules

* **Always treat every firearm as if it were loaded:** Even if you believe a firearm is unloaded, always handle it with the utmost caution.
* **Always keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction:** Never point a firearm at anything you are not willing to destroy. This means keeping it pointed downrange or at the ground, away from people.
* **Always keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot:** Your finger should remain outside the trigger guard until your sights are on the target and you are prepared to fire.
* **Always be sure of your target and what is beyond it:** Understand what you are shooting at and what might be behind it. In a controlled range environment, this means ensuring your shots impact the backstop.

# Range etiquette

* **Listen to your instructor:** Your instructor is there to ensure your safety and provide guidance. Follow their commands precisely and without hesitation.
* **Wear eye and ear protection:** These are mandatory at all reputable ranges to protect against noise and stray debris.
* **Handle firearms only when instructed:** Do not pick up, load, or unload a firearm unless specifically told to do so by your instructor.
* **Stay focused:** Pay attention to your surroundings and your actions. Distractions can lead to accidents.
* **No horseplay:** A shooting range is not the place for jokes or irresponsible behaviour. Maintain a serious and respectful attitude towards the firearms and the activity.

My fiancé was already outside sunbathing with her coffee. She looked relaxed, so I didn’t want to bother her. I assumed she’d already had enough and was good.

Later, I brewed a pot of coffee for myself. When she came back in and saw me pouring it, she said, “Why didn’t you ask if I wanted some?” in a sarcastic tone.

I told her I figured she already had some and didn’t want more. I even brewed extra just in case and offered to pour her some. She said no, again sarcastically.

A few minutes later she says, “What bothers me is the thought. It’s the fact you didn’t think to ask me. It makes me feel like you don’t love me.”

That honestly frustrated me. I’m a teacher and on summer break. Every single morning this summer, I wake up early to make her coffee, fill her water bottle, do all the little things to help her morning go smoother. I’ve done this every day, no matter how tired I am. One time I overslept and she blamed me for being late to work. Every other day, I’ve done it.

Meanwhile, during the school year, I go in earlier than her. She says she’ll make me coffee, but most of the time she sleeps through it (""she didnt feel me get up."" Maybe did it 3 or 4 times all year. I never complain, I just make it myself and move on.

So now I’m being told I don’t love her because I didn’t ask about coffee on one of her days off, when she already had some?

It just feels like a double standard. And when I bring stuff like this up, she always says I don’t see her side or that I’ll never understand.

A while back, Goodpeople had a sandwich board out front that said something like, “If you got coffee down the street and didn’t like it, bring it here for a free one.” It struck me as weird, not because it was competitive, but because Bonsai is also a small local business. If they had aimed that at Starbucks or Dunkin, fine. But another indie coffee shop right nearby? Totally turned me off to them.

Out of curiosity, I went down the rabbit hole of Yelp and Google reviews.

Turns out, the owner of Goodpeople regularly replies to negative reviews but not in a constructive way. It’s often snarky or hostile. A few times, he even accuses reviewers of being from Bonsai or being friends with their owners. He calls people “Karens,” accuses some of racism, and generally just comes off kind of unhinged for someone running a neighborhood café.

There's also a pending lawsuit filed against the Goodpeople owner by the property company that manages the building Bonsai is in. It alleges things like:

- Obstructing sidewalks and putting up illegal signs

- Loud music that disturbs neighboring businesses

- Intentionally blowing leaves and debris into the other building’s doorway

- Repeatedly dragging a broken tree branch in front of their door

- Even some wild claims about operating without permits and selling edibles or cannabis on-site

[From the case file:](https://trellis.law/doc/236818398/complaint-filed-by-opo-properties-llc-plaintiff-as-to-carlos-chuck-herrera-defendant-goodpeople-roasting-llc-defendant-gp-group-llc-defendant)
> On November 4, 2024, a large truck hit one of the city-owned trees in front of the shared building, breaking off a very large tree branch. The branch landed on a grass sidewalk median, also owned by the city. In another example of Herrera’s inappropriate behavior, he removed the branch from the median, dragged it to the Plaintiff’s building, and placed it directly in front of their front door — obstructing access and creating a potentially hazardous condition.

> One of the Plaintiff’s employees removed the branch so people could enter the building safely and moved it back to the median.

> The next morning, however, Herrera dragged the branch back to the front door. Plaintiff’s security cameras captured him doing this, and he repeated the act multiple times. Each time, employees had to remove the branch again to maintain safe access to the building. Eventually, due to Herrera’s persistence, the Plaintiff paid to have the branch hauled away at their own expense.

[Goodpeople launched a GoFundMe for their legal defense fund.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-goodpeople-continue-to-serve-you) In it, they claim to be the victims:

> To make matters worse, their own manager was arrested for throwing a 9-foot tree branch at one our staff, our Operations Manager. Despite our efforts to find common ground, we have been met with hate, disdain, and treatment as second-class citizens. This is not just about us—this is about standing up to corporate greed and ensuring that hardworking small businesses are not silenced.

Now the Gamma of the Crimson Fang Pack, Madilyn thrives with her loyal team, leaving behind the heartbreak and betrayal. But when Stanley’s pack crumbles and his true love fades, he returns, pleading for another chance. As Madilyn navigates her newfound strength and independence, old wounds resurface, and tensions rise. With Brycen Elliott, her childhood friend and former mate, by her side, Madilyn must decide whether to forgive or fight. Will she reclaim her power, or will Stanley’s persistence unravel her carefully crafted life?

# Chapter 1 - ""From Ashes to Rivalry""

Stanley Griffin, my former mate and the Alpha of the Silver Moon Pack, fell in love with my sister, Lottie Russell, claiming she was gentle and serene, unlike my fiery and headstrong nature.

I laughed. He seemed to forget that it was precisely my fiery and headstrong personality that helped him rise from the ashes and establish a pack of thousands.

At a pack gathering, he got drunk and confided in his Betas, ""I want to follow my heart and pursue what I truly love, not settle for a lifetime with Madilyn Lawrence.""

Later, I let him go, allowing him to chase his true love.

Meanwhile, I started over with my trusted team, pouring my heart into my new role as Gamma in the Crimson Fang Pack.

He seemed to regret it. Seeing his pack in shambles and his once-beloved now just a shadow of her former self, he begged me for another chance.

==============================

Stanley Griffin came to my office while I was in a meeting.

My team tactfully left the room.

I smirked, ""What, didn’t you go after your true love?""

He opened his mouth but ultimately said nothing.

""Madilyn, I was drunk that night, you…""

I cut him off impatiently, ""What you do is none of my concern.""

I had been devoted to Stanley for seven years, making his pack my priority, his moods my compass.

Yet, I still ended up being his second choice.

Watching him struggle to retort but hold back gave me immense satisfaction.

A month ago, it was Lottie Russell who mocked me in front of him:

""Sister, how could you not even keep your own mate?""

At that time, Stanley gently held her, as if she were the most precious treasure in the world, and whispered softly,

""How could she ever compare to you?""

==============================

For seven years, Stanley had been hot and cold with me.

Even though I stuck to him like glue, he remained indifferent.

I would wait at home with dinner ready, sometimes until two or three in the morning.

He would come home reeking of alcohol, his breath tinged with the faint smell of tobacco.

His rough kisses would land on my ear, collarbone, and further down…

I closed my eyes, my lashes fluttering, feeling his presence.

Only in those moments would he come close to me.

The next morning, the other side of the bed would be cold, as if he had never been there.

I laughed at myself. Back then, I was so naive to think that my companionship could warm his heart.

While I was foolishly waiting,

He was living out the dream I could never attain with Lottie.

I was such a fool, silent and blind.

==============================

Now, the only thing I feel grateful for is that,

During those seven years, I helped him manage the pack, negotiating with different packs every day, exhausting myself.

Lottie took advantage of this gap to develop a relationship with Stanley, engaging in their clandestine affair.

Little did I know that those years of being his loyal servant would give me a chance to start over.

I have the resources, connections, and leadership skills. What do you have to hold me back?

==============================

Just as my pack was thriving, disaster struck.

Aside from a few initial media reports about Stanley, his scandalous affair, which should have rocked the werewolf community, barely made a ripple.

Such a big story going unreported? It was obvious Richard Griffin, the Lycan Prince, had a hand in it.

Expected, after all, the elite care about their image.

What I didn’t expect was the Griffins turning the tables, buying trending hashtags.

Now, everyone in G City knows that the Griffin heir’s mate led a scandalous life, trying to marry into wealth and being rejected.

Years of hard work gone to waste, and the younger man I was rumored to be involved with left too.

I laughed in anger.

Many pack alliances terminated their contracts with my pack due to the rumors.

In the blink of an eye, the pack’s situation took a nosedive, teetering on the brink.

That’s when Brycen Elliott returned.

==============================

The Elliotts and the Lawrences were close family friends. Brycen was originally my mate, but I was so infatuated with Stanley that I gently rejected his feelings.

Unable to change my mind, he chose to stay out of sight, spending the last few years in a distant pack.

He had heard about my situation and rushed back from the U.S.

Bringing with him the connections and resources he had accumulated over the years.

Brycen and I had grown up together, and our默契 was such that we didn’t even need to speak to understand each other. I trusted him completely.

With his help, the pack’s situation improved significantly.

I began to expand new alliances based on my experience from working at Stanley’s pack,

Slowly forming a rivalry with Stanley’s pack.

The war between Stanley and me had just begun when the unscrupulous media started stirring up trouble again,

With headlines like ""Long-time lover steps in to lend a hand"" and ""Stanley and his lover as close as brothers, betrayed by deceit.""

I rolled my eyes, turning to Brycen, who was organizing files behind me, and bowed slightly.

""Sorry, sorry. Bear with it for a while, and I’ll clear your name.""

He smiled, his gaze locking onto mine.

""No big deal.""

# Chapter 2 - ""Echoes of a Broken Bond""

I thought Stanley and I would never cross paths again, at most, we’d be rivals in the pack hierarchy.

But in the midst of a fierce territorial dispute, he abruptly sold his pack’s territory.

I heard Richard Griffin, the Lycan Prince, was furious and threatened to disown him.

Lottie, being shrewd, saw that Stanley’s fortunes were dwindling and distanced herself early on.

I couldn’t help but wonder what had possessed him to do something so reckless.

Soon, I found out.

That evening, as I returned to my den, he cornered me in the narrow space by the door.

The familiar faint scent of tobacco enveloped me.

“Madilyn, I’ve missed you.”

He silently wrapped his arms around me from behind, his touch unexpectedly gentle.

He carried a faint whiff of alcohol, and I found myself wondering what he had been drinking today—it seemed different from before.

Suddenly, alarm bells rang in my head, and I forcefully broke free from his embrace. The dim light cast fragmented shadows in his eyes, and he raised an eyebrow slightly, his voice tinged with confusion.

“Madilyn?”

I wiped the corner of my eye, a wave of inexplicable disgust rising within me. I took a deep breath, trying to steady my emotions.

“What are you doing here? This is my territory.”

I stared directly at his slightly haggard face, a mix of complex emotions swirling inside me.

“Madilyn, I was wrong this time. I promise I won’t get involved with any other she-wolves again.”

I looked at him coldly, saying nothing.

He seemed startled by the icy look in my eyes, his hand awkwardly suspended in the air.

“Madilyn, enough of this. Don’t make a scene,” he said softly, reaching out to pull me closer.

“Who’s making a scene?”

“Cut me some slack. Everyone makes mistakes.”

“When I don’t like you anymore, don’t come bothering me. Who do you think you are?”

I took a few steps back, looking at him with mockery.

I finally realized how naive I had been, thinking that pretending not to know would keep him mine forever.

Thinking that forgiving him time and time again would move him.

Love can’t be earned through pity.

In the darkness, he was silent for a long moment.

“What do you want from me?”

I raised an eyebrow dramatically, glancing at him sideways.

“What do I want? I want you to get lost.”

“Don’t disturb me and Brycen.”

The next morning, I woke up at noon.

After spewing those harsh words last night, I slammed the door and left Stanley outside, going to sleep on my own.

Rubbing my temples, I realized I hadn’t slept well at all.

In my dreams, scenes overlapped, and I repeatedly witnessed Stanley at pack gatherings, in bars, flirting with different she-wolves.

Ugh, what a nightmare.

He’s the kind of Alpha who’s used to being the center of attention, treating love like a charitable handout.

He seems to have forgotten that he thought others’ admiration was based on what they could gain from him.

Once, someone loved his temper, his vulnerability, but he saw it as a loss of face.

True, pure love—he thought it was cheap.

Opening my work phone, 99+ messages flooded in.

My head was spinning.

Brycen’s call came through at that moment.

“Madilyn, where are you?”

Rubbing my temples, I sighed.

“At my den. What’s up?”

“There’s a negotiation this afternoon with the VP of the Moonstone Pack. I think you should meet them.”

The sunlight filtered through the thin clouds, casting a warm glow over the bustling city streets.

When I arrived at the pack headquarters, Brycen was already waiting for me downstairs.

Today, he wore a dark casual suit paired with a crisp white shirt, the collar slightly open, exuding a relaxed yet elegant vibe.

His tie was a solid color, complementing the suit and shirt, neither too flashy nor too plain. His dark straight-leg pants were perfectly tailored, neither too tight nor too loose.

On his feet were black leather shoes, smooth and unadorned, yet exuding a subtle luxury.

Nothing like Stanley’s flashy peacock style.

Tsk tsk, those long legs, that broad shoulders and narrow waist—what a sight.

As I approached, he seemed to sense my presence and looked up, handing me an Americano. A faint cedar scent wafted from his sleeves, his signature cologne.

“Madilyn.”

I took the coffee.

“Let’s talk inside.”

# Chapter 3 - ""Ravioli, Rivalries, and Reminders""

The discussion lasted the entire afternoon, and by the time all the details were finalized, the city lights had already illuminated the night outside.

""Madilyn, let's go grab some of Alfredo’s ravioli,"" Brycen said as he gently draped a coat over my shoulders from behind.

I remember when I was a pup, I’d knock on Brycen’s door whenever I got hungry at night, and he’d take me to a small alley not far from home for ravioli. The pasta was thin, the filling generous, and they were always piping hot. We’d both eat until we were sweating, and Brycen would fan me while holding a chilled soda to my lips.

Since we went there so often, Alfredo, the pack’s Healer, got to know us and would often sneak a few shrimp-filled ravioli into our bowl of pork ones.

As those memories surfaced, I couldn’t help but smile softly. Those were the best days of our lives.

""Alright, let’s bring something for Alfredo too,"" I said.

He smirked. ""Sure.""

He took me to a nearby supermarket. I had intended to buy some health supplements for Alfredo, but in the fresh produce section, I spotted a familiar figure—Alpha Stanley Griffin.

He saw me too, and Brycen, who was pushing the cart beside me.

========================================

What followed was a scene straight out of a dramatic soap opera.

His eyes first lit up like a shooting star streaking across a dark sky, a brief flash of brilliance in the deep blackness. Then, just as quickly, the star plummeted to the ground, stirring up a whirlwind of dust, igniting a fiery blaze.

Alpha Stanley strode over to me in three quick steps, bringing a gust of wind with him.

He first lifted his chin, giving Brycen a cool, appraising glance, his posture immediately turning defensive. Then he turned to me, his voice tinged with a hint of grievance.

""Madilyn, didn’t you always say you wanted to try my cooking? I thought you’d be coming home soon, so I came out to buy some ingredients to make you dinner.""

Before I could respond, Brycen turned his head and spoke calmly, ""Madilyn, I know you’re compassionate, but you shouldn’t just bring any stray home. You never know what hidden motives they might have.""

""Yeah, trying to lay a hand on someone else’s mate. People might start thinking you have some kind of weird obsession.""

""Madilyn doesn’t like to make a fuss, but don’t think for a second that you’re worthy of her.""

""Since when did our business become your concern, outsider?""

""Who’s the outsider here, Alpha Stanley?""

I listened to their thinly veiled barbs, feeling like I was caught in the middle of a childish spat. Rubbing my temples, I finally interjected, ""Alright, we’ve got what we need. Let’s go?""

""Let’s go.""

""Let’s go.""

Both voices rang out simultaneously, one clear and cool, the other deep and resonant, but both equally dangerous.

It was clear that this wasn’t going to end easily.

""You…"" I turned to Alpha Stanley, forcing myself to meet his gaze. ""Don’t come bothering me again.""

I didn’t understand. He was the one who had cheated, so why did his eyes still hold such clarity?

I mentally scoffed. Alphas will always be Alphas, putting on a facade with such confidence, as if it were real.

========================================

It was getting late, and Alfredo was about to close up shop when he saw us and welcomed us in with a warm smile.

Alfredo’s hair had grown whiter, his back more hunched, and he was always coughing now.

Time silently slipped by, and certain moments served as reminders that some things were gone forever.

The ravioli still tasted the same as I remembered, but now we were all grown up.

At the next table sat a father and son. The father was feeding his son bite by bite. At his feet was a burlap sack. When he noticed me looking their way, he gave a simple smile and opened the sack slightly, pulling out two bright orange tangerines.

""Here, miss, try these. They’re from our own garden.""

I took them and thanked him. They were sweet.

After we finished eating, Brycen drove me home.

As we said goodbye, he gave me a gentle hug.

""Madilyn, if you need anything, call me.""

His embrace was warm and comforting. I took a deep breath. ""Alright.""

Everything was getting better, after all.

Even if I had a bit of grass growing on my head, I’d plant flowers in it.

I was a modern, independent she-wolf. Love couldn’t tie me down.

But then, almost immediately, I saw Alpha Stanley crouched by my doorstep, a bunch of green vegetables and bags of red and white meat beside him.

Hearing the sound, he quickly looked up.

Just like he was at home.

His eyes were still a bit moist. Yeah, even more like it.

I couldn’t keep smiling.

# Chapter 4 - ""Shadows of the Past and Present""

""Can you scoot over a bit? Yeah, that’s better.""He stood up, and suddenly I was engulfed in his shadow .As I typed in the passcode, I casually glanced at him.

What were once considered a sickly, saccharine sweet fragrance, today’s perfumers of edible gourmands have been more and more experimental and creative in their work to sate the desires of fragrance lovers looking for scents that evoke delicious foods and deserts. The moorish nature of edible gourmands can produce great comfort and nostalgia; that Sunday morning warm, buttery croissant in bed, the coffee or hot chocolate with a friend, the candy floss at an amusement park, the marshmallows searing on a fire pit or the joy of standing in a patisserie, inhaling the aroma as you decide what your treat is going to be. 

Of course edible gourmands aren’t for everyone. I find them beautiful to smell, delightful on other people, but difficult to wear - mainly because I have sweet tooth and I’d just end up wanting to reach for cake all day long. But I’m trying to sample outside of my comfort zone and found a gentle and bright, fresh lactonic gourmand and I’m testing it at night for bed for the last few weeks; Victoria’s Secret Tease Crème Cloud (I’m taking baby steps🤪)

So I got my Aiden about two months ago, and the Sculpture 078 about a month ago (upgraded from Sage Smart Grinder Pro).  
  
I really enjoy most coffee I make, but I think it can be much better.  
I mostly drink Natural, light/medium-light coffees, and experimenting with new ones on weekly basis.  
Grind setting between 7-9 (200-500ml)  
100%/50% TWW water (honestly I probably shouldn't have mess with this variable until I've gotten something I really like and then try to experiment with water, if you think 100/50% is probably the way to go LMK).  
Also tried multiple different profiles, temperatures, cold blooms, and ratios (15/16.5, no other ratio TBH).  
The profile I'm using rn is: 16.5 ratio, 1:3 60s 92C bloom, pulse1 90C, pulse2 88C. 15s between pulses.  
  
I'm really bad at describing taste so I honestly don't know to which direction should I take my changes a lot of times, but I must try then I'd say **not sweet enough is no.1 thing I wanna improve.**

I'm looking for both suggestions to improve my current recipe but also maybe suggestions for the future, how to dial in future coffees.

I have raised the worms in totes, buckets and in the ground.  I have had them disappear (die) and/or get the ground flooded out and I lost everything.  I had them in a low lying area that I thought would be a good idea because it stays moist.

This year I set up this on a garden site.  I planted tomatoes and squash in buckets with holes in the bottom of the buckets for drainage and worms can go in and out.  Plus this provides shade and a hiding place for the worms.

I am continually adding cow manure and horse manure.  I get veggie greens for free from a local Asia Market.  I get coffee grounds for free from a local Starbucks.  I get spent grain for free from a local brewery.

I do a lot of running around to get all those ingredients.  I do buy chicken feed ($16.00 for a 50 lb bag at Tractor Supply) and Dolemite Lime to knock down the flies and gnats.

This is by far the best I've ever done with the worms.   It is LOADED with worms.  

While it has been extremely HOT here in Richmond, Virginia,  we have been getting some good thunderstorms late in the day several times a week.   I also water the area by hose each evening to keep it moist.    This area has a good runoff for excess water which I have found to be good.

I have noticed that the chicken feed helps to fatten up the worms.  I had never tried that before.

I have a row of plastic totes on the sidewalk.  I put them there just to build a wall so I can toss the manure on the area and it not go onto the sidewalk.  The worms seem to love living under the totes.  Some manure landed in one of the totes and now there is a large amount of worms growing in that.

I have noticed the worms have gone under the sidewalk.  Which protects them and it is probably moist and cool under the concrete.

I will start selling worms online in the Fall.  I sell locally on Craigslist.  I can probably sell the worm compost if I want to, but I'm not thinking about that right now.

I get a lot of flies due to the spent grain.  Which attracts lizards, birds and frogs.  I saw a couple snakes but I don't think they were there for the worms (just out exploring).  I noticed now that some mole tunnels are being constructed, so I have to do something about that.  In the past I found the noise making solar vibration things work well to scare them off. 

I hope everyone is doing well.  If you are having issues with your worms, just keep on trying.  This is definitely a trial and error hobby.",2,1751658836.0,Vermiculture,0,1.0,False

This is particularly for people trying to stay COVID safe. (It's sad I have to say this but please refrain from trolling me with comments.) Just being told a place has outdoor seating doesn't give you all the details so I did A LOT of research so you don't have to, probably looking into about 150 restaurants. Hopefully some people will find it helpful because otherwise it's tricky to navigate whether seating is covered, whether it would work in the rain, how many tables there are, is it nice or just utilitarian, and in some cases whether they'd take reservations for the outdoor area.  
  
Our homebase was in Crystal City so I vetted that area for places to eat with our extended family of 11 that would also work in the rain.

D.C. is tough compared to where we live in California because you have to contend with rain in the summer. I’ve put “GOOD IN RAIN” next to some of the restaurants that would work. I wish I knew of places that had misters or could keep you cool on the hottest days, especially at lunch.

Every morning, guests come down looking for a basic breakfast (milk for cereal, spoons, plates, yogurt), and guess what? Half of it’s missing. And guess who gets yelled at for it? Me.

We have a breakfast attendant, but it doesn’t matter because management ignores the stock lists, doesn’t order supplies, and doesn’t care when guests complain. The manager is never here, doesn’t pick up calls, and is MIA for everything from maintenance to breakfast to guest issues. But sure, I’ll stand here at the desk apologizing to every guest for things that aren’t my responsibility while management collects their paycheck for doing nothing.

And let’s not forget the breakfast guy, who sees guests about to ask for milk and vanishes into the bathroom so the complaints land on me instead.

It’s honestly embarrassing for the property. Guests think we’re incompetent, but the reality is we have management that refuses to do the bare minimum to keep the hotel running. Meanwhile, front desk staff are left to be the punching bag for every missing spoon, every cold coffee complaint, every broken AC, every bug sighting, and every maintenance issue because there’s no one else to take responsibility.

Management’s only talent is avoiding problems until someone else (me) has to handle the fallout.

If you’re staying at a hotel and are frustrated, please know that the person at the front desk is probably trying to hold the place together while management can’t be bothered to order milk or pick up a phone.

TL;DR: Bad management won’t do their job, so now breakfast, maintenance, and guest complaints all become my job while they hide.

1lrrihd,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lrrihd/the_final_recital_part_3/,The Final Recital (Part 3),"Part 3: Prelude



For a moment I forgot where I was. But after coming back to my senses, the air had changed. It was thicker—not because of humidity or heat, but like I was underwater. Sounds were muffled, my breath was slightly strained. I looked back out into Dorset Hollow, but it was still there. Silent, slow-moving, waiting. The streets were empty as always, but now—for some reason, I knew people were there. 



I walked past stores that sold nothing. A flowershop with dead tulips in the window, a tailor with no mannequins. Even a post office where mail slots were nailed shut. But then I saw it again.



The *DIN(N)ER* sign was flickering like it didn’t have anywhere more important to be. I walked in, if only for the sense of normalcy it would provide. That was naive of me. The same waitress stood—with the same cherry-red lips that her smile stopped at. 



I didn’t ask for any, but she poured me coffee. “Sleep well, honey?” she asked.



“Not really.”



She didn’t say anything to that, but placed a napkin near my cup. Someone had drawn some music notes on it in pen—the same three notes from my dream.



“You know this song?” I asked.



“It knows you.”



I didn’t ask her to explain.



I wandered deeper into town after I downed my coffee. The Hollow itself wasn’t big, but it was deep—like a painting where the shadows would lead you to another. Roads looped back onto themselves, houses kept repeating, but with slightly different, barely noticeable features when I passed them again. I tried to escape this town, just to see if I could, but every road led back onto itself and every sign became circular.



There were no cars, no wind, no animals. I was drawn by the smell of fresh bread to a bakery, but the door was locked. The sign outside simply wrote “Recital Tonight—7PM”



I passed a bookstore that I hadn’t noticed before, or maybe it just wasn’t there before. There was a single book displayed behind the window. Its title, in silver ink on a blue face, said “The Audience Remains”. 

I walked in. There was no bell, just a hush that sank into my soul. Sat on the counter was a woman who must have been the clerk. She didn’t react to my entry or presence.



The shelves were full of books that were bound in some strange leather. It was too dry, too smooth. Most of them had no titles. Some were filled with nothing but blank pages, some with nonsensical piano scores. I opened one and it had, written down to the very bottom of every single page:



LIAM GOODPRAY

LIAM GOODPRAY

LIAM GOODPRAY



I slammed it shut and looked up. The lady behind the counter hadn’t moved an inch, her back still turned to me. But then I noticed it. She was humming. The same three notes. I left before she could turn around.



I needed more coffee. So I went back to the diner. It was quieter now though, the indoor lights were dimmed slightly and the red glow of the *DIN(N)ER* sign was noticeably faded. The young man was sitting in his booth. Same flannel shirt and same thousand-yard stare. He nodded to me as I entered and then pointed to some kind of bulletin board near the register. 



“I didn’t know you were famous,” he said.



I looked. It was a recital poster. In an elegant, silver-penned script at the bottom was the Bellmare Hall crest. But the person on it wasn’t me. It was Claire.



She was mid-performance, at that same piano from the hall. Her black hair was tucked behind one ear on her tilted head. The dress she was wearing was the same blue as the flash I had seen yesterday in the concert hall. Her expression was the same one she had when she got lost in the music—poised, serene, beautiful.



But the date at the bottom of the poster, between the crest and the picture, read “March 3rd, 1953”.



“That’s not me,” I said, barely holding back tears.



The man simply looked at me and shrugged. “Sure looks like you buddy.”



I stared harder at the poster, and just for a second, I could see it. My hands on the keys, my face superimposed onto hers. But then it was gone. Just Claire again.



I blinked and some tears made their way through. “That’s not me. Just someone I knew. Someone who’s gone.”



He looked at me again, with no emotion behind it except maybe tiredness. “Lots of folks think they recognize someone in these old posters. Faces change, blurs overlap. But she’s always there, the lady in the blue dress. Always seated in the front row, always smiling like they’re playing a song that she composed.”



I stepped forward and had my face maybe a few inches away from the poster. More details emerged—details that shouldn’t have been there. A necklace I gave her on our third anniversary, a scar on her hand from that time she broke a plate.



“This can’t be real. She’s never been here. She wasn’t even born in the fifties.”



“Time’s funny in this town, especially around Bellmare,” the man said, looking at his coffee. “Sometimes it doesn’t flow, sometimes it sits still, waiting.”



“For what”



He took a sip of coffee. “You.”



I stepped out of the diner, my heart pounding in my chest like a wild animal in a cage, and my hands squeezed so tight it felt like I was holding glass. I didn’t know where I was going, but I just had to walk. 



A poster from 1953. With Claire on it. This had to be some twisted joke. A prank that the whole town was in on. But I couldn’t explain the necklace or the scar, or how her face almost became mine for a second. 



I kept walking. Went right past that damnable bookstore. I’m praying it gets burned to the ground. Right by those stupid houses. Shadows followed me in the windows like angels of death, but they would be gone once I looked at them. And the sun seemed to be setting, but only in the spots where I stood. Maybe I’m just going crazy.



I just kept walking. But then I noticed it—past the hollow buildings and shaded windows. A small church, rooted in ivy and fog. Its white steeple pointed heavenward. The door hung open, inviting me in. The sign out front was faded, but I still made out the lettering:



*Saint Cecilia’s—Est. 1897*



Beneath it, scratched into the wood:



*“Sing unto Him, ye who mourn”*



I stepped inside. The temperature dropped immediately. It wasn’t just cool, it was freezing, like an arctic crypt. I could even see my breath. The air smelled like damp wood and it had a sharp, metallic undertone that I couldn’t make out. The interior was dimly lit, but it was still intact—untouched by time. Pews were lined up like a tightly-knit army and a simple altar stood at the opposite end of the door. A modest piano sat to the side of it, much different than the one in Bellmare. This one didn’t seem to be calling me to play. 



On the walls were stained-glass windows, but the colors seemed too dark. I thought it was just dust, but then I noticed that there was no sunlight behind the glass, despite the fact that it was the afternoon. It was more like they reflected the glow of a dying blaze: strong, impactful, but otherwise ending.



I moved further in. The floor creaked sadly beneath my feet, as if it was mourning itself. On top of the pews, candles were lit, leaking wax down the wood—leaving fresh impressions upon the cushions. There wasn’t a soul in sight, but I saw the hymnal. It laid upon the altar, pages yellowed and stained. One stood out—fresh ink was written on it, blacker than black. It read:



*“Requiem for the Empty: For the grieving and the chosen”*



Beneath that title was a list of names. A couple dozen perhaps. They didn’t mean anything to me, after all, they were just names. But then I noticed the dates beside them. They ranged from the early 1900s all the way up to 2018. Each had a title.



*“Harold Carr (1902)—Died during performance”*

*“Benjamin Mandol (1907)—Checked in, hasn’t checked out”*

*“Jonathan Bale (1912)—Playing still”*



And right there at the very end:



*“Claire Halden (2018)—Admitted. Not recovered”*



I stared in shock. This couldn’t be the same Claire. My Claire. Halden was her last name, but this is impossible. Then I noticed something off about the page. It was strangely warm. I turned around without even thinking. Nothing behind me but the dripping wax. But then I saw the floor.



The impressions of bare footprints on the dust led from the altar to some corner in the back near the confessionals. I followed. The door of the booth was open, just a bit. I didn’t step in—I couldn’t. Not when I saw what was scratched onto the inside of the door:



*“It’s not her. Not really”*



Then from behind me, where the piano lay—three haunting notes. 



That was enough. I left quickly. Not running though, I didn’t want to feel like prey, but every step had more effort put into it than the last. I eventually had to force myself to go further, like something behind me was forcing me to stay. I didn’t look back, not even once.



Back in town, the sky had dimmed. It wasn’t sunset, not yet, but the light was dying. Shadows stretch farther than they should have been able to. A nearby clock read 4:22 p.m, but I don’t think time was behaving correctly anymore. I passed the town square and noticed a statue. It wasn’t a war memorial or a founder’s statue or anything. It was a man seated at a piano. His arms stretched and bent wrong, fingers melted into the keys. No name or plaque adorned it, but wrapped around his throat like a noose was a blue scarf. And a lavender bouquet laid at his feet. I continued onward.



I made it back to the hall just after 5:00 p.m. The doors were already open, beckoning to me. Inside, the chandeliers were lit, and the air held a hush—like an auditorium right before a conductor lifts their baton. Mr. Wellers stood waiting in the lobby, same suit, same smile. 



“You’ve seen her, haven’t you?” he asked. The way he said it was too casual, like he’s said it a thousand times before.



“I’ve seen…something,” I replied.



“Mr. Wellers finds that it often helps to look,” he said, hands folded. “But not too long. Reflection is a doorway, Mr. Goodpray. But some doors, once opened, don’t shut.”



I stared at him. “You speak like a preacher. Or maybe like…something else is speaking for you.”



His lips curled ever so slightly, into something not quite a smirk. “Wellers is but a humble mouthpiece,” he replied. He then paused, tilted his head, and stared right through my soul. And then, in a voice not his own, “But the tune is me.”



Nope. That’s it. That’s the line. I backed away, but he didn’t move, didn’t follow. He just bowed his head.



“You should rest,” he said, his voice back to his Louisiana tone. “The performance begins at seven sharp.”



I tried to go to my car, but my legs had other ideas—pretty soon, my brain followed their lead. Instead, I climbed the stairs back to my room. The passage there seemed longer than before, deeper even. My door was open even though I distinctly remember closing it. Inside, a suit was laid on the bed. Black cashmere and silk, cleanly pressed, spotless. Under the amber lights, it shimmered like the night sky. Beside it lay a single lavender and a slip of paper. I picked it up. In the same damn handwriting as the letter that started this whole mess, it read:



*“Bellmare Presents: One Night Only*

*Liam Goodpray, Pianist*

*Those who play, remain”*



Outside, I heard the wind whisk their way through the branches, like whispering voices. And beneath it, music. It wasn’t a melody I knew, but one I could understand. It had a purpose. Shape. But then, it exploded from everywhere. The bed, the desk, the walls, even the windows. I leaned closer to one, drawn in like a sailor to a siren. A reflection began to form in the glass, but it was not my own. 



Claire. In that blue dress, sitting in the front row of the concert hall, just as the young man said. Through the reflection, her eyes met mine. She was smiling—not kindly, nor cruelly. Just knowingly. And then, a nod.



The clock in the wall struck 6:55. I reached for the suit.



Time to play.

For almost 4 months we were very good friends.

Like we used to hang out, played sports and even had similar likings on certain things. Now slowly after 4 months I noticed that I am having feelings for her and suddenly became more caring.

Now I carried this feeling for another 6 months trying to figure out whether this feeling is coming naturally or I’m just imagining it.

Now within this 6 months window we became more close and was added into her friends group and family.

After one day over a cup of tea, I confessed that I have feelings for her. Now that confession was met with a disrespectful rejection.

Things like - “what you did for me, anyone could have done it” (I used to check in on her whenever she got sick and hospitalised)

“You don’t speak much and spend most of your time in your hobbies”

Somehow all the blame came to me which I did not understand. I am an ambivert and she was an extrovert and sometimes I like to spend my time on my hobbies, because they are skills which I gained overtime.

Even though I think I have to move on from this because post confession whenever I tried to initiate a conversation it is met with hot and cold behaviour. So I had to abandon her and her friends. Because if nothing can happen, then why should I give my time to her, because she only said I have only been with her for couple of hours (this is because I used to meet her almost everyday while playing sports).

But somehow after all this my mind gets tied to her.

1lrrfhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pokerface/comments/1lrrfhw/something_to_fill_the_holes_in_the_story/,Something to fill the holes in the story.,"I have a theory on Alex's (back)story. There have been really great theories on this sub so far, and most lead to Alex being Charlie's rival (her Moriarty, as some say) this season. This is another side of that, mostly to fill some holes in those great theories.

Motivation: Alex is the boss of one of the mafias who has it out for Hasp ever since Hasp went into WITSEC. Hasp knows information and Alex just doesn't want that information getting out.

Now Alex might've already known about Hasp and Charlie's relationship before Hasp went into WITSEC, that is why she introduced herself to Charlie at the coffee shop. Many theorists have said Alex may be Good Buddy, considering CB radios don't really go that far. So Alex is already with Charlie ever since, and she just lead her to New York where there is an apartment Charlie can stay in. Also, who is in New York and conveniently getting married soon? Hasp's son!

My theory is either Good Buddy is the ""employer"" on the phone with the Iguana and Alex is the ""employer's"" boss or Alex is Good Buddy.

There are just so many coincidences in this episode alone that it's really suspicious. Alex suggesting the oyster gig at Hasp's son's wedding. The Iguana finding a patsy to take the fall when Mr. T is already the patsy. Alex may have been the one on the phone with the Iguana when she suggested to find a patsy because the timing of her coming in was just sooo convenient! She presented herself as such a good target to be the patsy. (She really put that much trust in the most dangerous and deadly hitman in the world.)

>!Also, the title of the last episode is ""The End of the Road."" Who's the one that's been with Charlie on the road...? Good Buddy!!<

What's boggling me now is if these are all true, Alex would seem to be such a mastermind to do everything. Even presenting herself as such a vulnerable target to the Iguana. But I'm also wondering where the Iguana went. We didn't see what happened between after Alex saw Hasp's son dead on the boat and when she woke up at the boat alongside Hasp's son.

(Another twisted theory: Hasp's son and Alex are in a relationship or in cahoots. They set up the wedding and everything, even the Iguana just so they can find Hasp. Since we didn't see what happened at the boathouse, the dead guy on the boat might be the Iguana. But this theory has a lot of plotholes, and again, they be putting that much trust to the most dangerous and deadly hitman in the world, per Luca. LOL)

Hey all,

So I’ll try and keep this brief - but be sure to give enough info.

My career thus far:
Fundraiser / organizer at a small progressive non-profit : 3.5 years. - organized phone banks, didndonor out reach and some major gifts fundraising. As welll.
Low key hated it. It felt like sales… somewhat manipulative, and honestly disingenuous

Barista 3 years. - favorite job I’ve ever had. Community. The science of coffee. The fast paced nature. The musicians and artists and weirdos I worked with. 


Teacher: 5 years - don’t even get me started. Why did I stay so long I don’t know. I thought it would get better. It left me so jaded to the state of the world and education I’m general. I taught 5th  grade science and computer science and my last year 8th grade science and computer science.


A bit about me: I studied sociology, philosophy and marketing in college. I am mission driven for the most part and want meaningful work. I’m pretty socialist /anti-capitalist in my beliefs so doing corporate work is not ideal for me … but tbh … I have never had a clock in clock out type of job.

 ideas:

Software developer: I absolutely love coding. The problem solving, the creativity. All of it. Sure I’d have to work at a major corp, but w/e high paying job with a cool skill that cluld take me anywhere (hopefully).  I WAS thinking of trying to finish up the Odin project and continue building up my coding skills, but tbh, I’m a bit defeated w/ it and the rise of AI and vibe coding… feels like an uphill battle.

Data Analysis: similar to above

Customer success manger / Learning and development: seem like great jobs that have transferable skills from teacher. I would ideally like to get into the Ed tech space

Networking my way into the Ai in education space some how…


Out of the box ideas:

Flight attendant: honestly - why not. Great benefits (free travel basically) and relatively easy job for decent pay.

Nurse:  yes would have to go aback to
School for 2 years or so. But I’m genuinely leaning toward this the most. It is meaningful and purposeful, pays well, skill based, intellectual in a way. I could probably make 6 figures by the time I’m 45? 


Gig work: as continue to figure it out. Door dash, dog walk, etc (this is temporary)



Soooo  yeah - clearly I’m all over the place. I am 37 and don’t want to she to go through this process all over again, so I’m really taking my time to try and figure out what comes next. I’m open to literally anything. 

There’s definitely more I could add but I think this sms it up well. Feel free to ask any more question. ",1,1751657514.0,findapath,3,1.0,False

1lrra34,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1lrra34/advice_please_restrictions_on_outside_visits/,Advice please - Restrictions on outside visits,"Hi Grandmother is in her 90s and been in a care home in Northern Ireland for around 3 years.

She is doing well considering age and diagnosis. Gets confused about where she is and calls me by my mums name on occasion but mostly knows family and friends, has no mobility issues, can hold a conversation (albeit not a long one) and is generally in good spirits, loves a laugh and joke etc.

Family and friends visit daily and usually take her out for an hour or so for coffee or shopping. We belive this has helped keep her active and was good for her.

A friend went to take her out today as usual and the care home manager apparently wouldn't allow it. She said that it takes too long to settle her when she goes out so she won't be going out anymore. Friend called to ask us and we had no idea about it. We had taken her for coffee yesterday and she seemed well when she got back.

We know that at times she may be confused about where she is, naturally. But this seems like an extreme response and not one that has been discussed with family?

We went a couple of months ago and were told they had started giving her diazepam nightly to settle her as she was getting distressed at night but we were never made aware of this. We were happy to accept this as we trusted their opinion however since this whenever we turn up she is tired and just wants to sleep so I'm concerned it's done more harm than good.

I'm worried her condition will deteriorate more rapidly if she spends her days sleeping and has no access to the outside world but I've no idea where we stand with this.

Any help would be really appreciated, we are currently awaiting a call back from the care home.",1,1751657406.0,dementia,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1: The Man with Mismatched Eyes

The autumn rain of 1942 drummed against the windows of Café de Flore with the persistence of a Gestapo interrogation. Outside, Paris lay draped in sullen gray, its streets slick with mist and mud, its balconies stripped of flags and laughter. The city had become a museum of silence, where boots echoed louder than bells and smiles had become a form of contraband.
Inside the café, the lights were dim to conserve power. A few patrons hunched at their tables like ghosts, murmuring into their bowls of ersatz soup, pretending not to notice the uniforms that patrolled the street beyond. A violinist in the back corner played softly, almost apologetically, the music sweet and brittle like sugar glass.

Professor Marcel Dubois sat near the fogged-up window, hunched over a leather-bound notebook. His fingers trembled slightly as he scribbled another line in his manuscript, then scratched it out. The ink was cheap and watery, and his pen caught on the thin ration-paper. It didn’t matter. The treatise he was writing would never be published—not in a city where philosophy had been replaced by surveillance, and all metaphysics had been deferred to the Reich.
The title was written in neat, careful hand across the top page: On the Equality of Human Souls.
His coffee had long grown cold, but real coffee was a luxury he could no longer afford. The bitter chicory brew before him was a meager treasure, and he sipped it slowly, more for the ritual than the taste.
A bell jingled faintly as the café door opened.

Marcel did not look up at first. Doors opened. Boots entered. People vanished. The world went on.
But the air shifted. He felt it like a pressure in his ears, a pause in the music that hadn’t happened. Something new had stepped inside.
""Monsieur le Professeur,"" came a voice smooth as silk and sharp as a blade, ""how fascinating to find someone writing about souls in a city where they're being collected so efficiently.""

Marcel looked up.
The man before him was tall, strikingly elegant, dressed in a dark three-piece suit that seemed untouched by rain or rationing. His overcoat was the color of dried wine, and his gloves were so pristine they might have been tailored yesterday. But it was the man’s face that held Marcel captive—composed, symmetrical, and wrong in a way he couldn’t articulate. One eye was green, as fresh and sharp as new leaves; the other was black, not the black of pigment but of depth, like looking into a well at midnight.

""Excuse me?"" Marcel said, instinctively moving his notebook closer to his chest.
""No need for alarm, Professor. I'm merely an admirer of philosophical discourse."" The stranger gestured toward the empty chair across from him. ""May I? These days, interesting conversation is rarer than butter.""
Marcel hesitated.

Conversation had become a dangerous sport in Paris. Words carried weight, and the wrong phrase overheard in the wrong place could land you in the back of a van, or worse. But there was something magnetic about the stranger, something that overrode caution with curiosity. Marcel nodded.

Without waiting for the full gesture, the man sat down with a grace that suggested stages rather than sidewalks. He snapped his fingers once.

Marcel blinked.

A waiter appeared instantly, Henri, the boy who had vanished three months ago after the Germans came looking for his brother. But here he was, his apron crisp, his face expressionless, bearing a silver tray with a small porcelain pot of real coffee and a plate of croissants that steamed with impossible warmth.

The stranger smiled. ""Some things are too important to ration.""
""Who are you?"" Marcel whispered.
""You may call me Monsieur Virel,"" the man replied, lifting the silver lid from the coffee pot. ""I’m something of a specialist in human nature. And you, my dear professor, are about to become very important to the fate of this city.""
Marcel stared at him. “Why?”
""Because you still believe in souls,"" Virel said. ""That quaint, stubborn notion that each person contains something indivisible and sacred. Paris needs that belief now more than ever.""

Marcel looked down at his manuscript, feeling exposed.
""You’ve been writing that for months,” Virel continued, pouring coffee into a delicate china cup. “Pages you never show to anyone. You fear they’ll laugh. Or worse, agree with you and vanish the next day. But here you are. Still writing. That means something.”
""You speak as if you’ve been watching me.""
""I have,"" Virel said simply. ""All of you. The dreamers, the stitchers, the ones who hide strangers beneath floorboards and sleep with knives under their pillows. You are the real heartbeat of this city. And I’ve come because your time has arrived.""
Marcel's hands trembled again—not from fear, but from recognition. Something inside him, buried under weeks of fear and exhaustion, stirred. A question he hadn’t dared ask in months: What if there was still a way to fight?
""And what do you want from me?"" he asked.
Virel raised his cup in a toast. “Just your attention. For now.”
The steam rose between them, perfumed and impossible.
Outside, the rain grew heavier, blurring the streetlights into halos.
Inside, the café seemed to shift around them—smaller, darker, warmer. The other patrons blurred into shadows. The violinist’s tune changed subtly, becoming something older, something in a minor key that whispered of endings and thresholds.
Virel leaned forward, eyes gleaming.
""Tonight, I will ask you a question. And if you answer it truly, the world may yet turn. But you won’t answer it here. You’ll answer it in a place where truth and danger walk hand in hand.""
He set a folded paper on the table—thick vellum, sealed with red wax bearing an unknown symbol.
“An invitation?” Marcel asked.
“A summons,” Virel corrected. “Midnight. Opéra Garnier. Box Seven.”
Marcel looked down at the seal, then up—but Virel was already gone. No door had opened. No footsteps echoed away. Just a fading scent of tobacco, violets, and snow.
Henri, the missing waiter, stood in place for a moment longer, as if waiting to be dismissed from a play whose script he had never read. Then he too vanished into the blur of shadow and silence.
The rain outside continued.
Marcel stared at the invitation, heart pounding.
The cup of coffee on the table before him was still warm.

Chapter 2: The Seamstress of Montmartre

Three stories above the winding cobblestone streets of Montmartre, where the rooftops clung like crooked teeth to the Parisian skyline, Marguerite Beaumont worked by candlelight. The gas had been cut again, and the blackout curtains were drawn tight. Outside, curfew reigned, and the air was filled with that peculiar stillness that follows a city learning to hold its breath.
Her needle darted in and out of the woolen coat in her lap, the thread pulling tight with the steady rhythm of muscle memory. By the flickering light of three half-burnt candles, Marguerite's hands moved with the precision of a concert pianist. But she was not mending. She was transforming. Beneath the coat’s lining, she sewed a hidden pocket just large enough to hold forged identification papers—ink still damp, names still false.
A small tin of hair dye, a pair of broken glasses, and a length of silk scarf would complete the disguise. Tomorrow, the man who once introduced himself as Jacob Rosenberg would leave this apartment as Jacques Rousseau, a tired schoolteacher from Limoges with bad eyesight and a ticket for the 4:10 southbound train.
If all went according to plan.
If no one spoke his name.
If no one opened the wrong drawer.
If no one knocked on the door in the dead of night.
The Rosenbergs had been living in hiding for six months. First in a root cellar outside Saint-Denis. Then in the crawl space of a butcher’s shop. Now here, in Marguerite’s cramped two-room apartment, where every breath sounded too loud and every floorboard betrayed its age.
She could hear the daughter, Sophie, barely sixteen, sitting near the window behind the curtain. The girl had taken to tracing shapes in the condensation with her fingertip, then watching as they disappeared. Sometimes she whispered poems she could no longer remember fully, like incantations that once held power and now only kept her sane.
Marguerite paused to flex her fingers. The blood had slowed in her knuckles. Her needle trembled slightly. She hated when it did that. It reminded her of things she had no time to feel.
“Maman,” came Sophie’s voice, soft and uneven. “Why do they hate us so?”
Marguerite set her sewing down and turned. She wasn't Sophie's mother—had never had children of her own—but over the past weeks, Sophie had begun calling her that in the same way one might begin lighting a candle before sleep: for comfort, not logic.
“I don’t know, ma chérie,” Marguerite answered, her voice low. “Hate is often loudest when people are afraid.”
The girl nodded, though her expression didn’t change. Her hand pressed to the windowpane, pale fingers blooming against the fogged glass like petals trying to push through winter.
There was a knock at the door.
Not the harsh, impatient banging of the Gestapo. Not the heavy stomp of boots demanding obedience. But a rhythm—a tap-tap-pause, tap—strangely gentle and deliberate, like someone humming through their knuckles.
Marguerite rose quietly. She took no chances. The pistol was hidden behind the jar of preserved peaches. She slid it into the pocket of her apron, then crossed the room without sound.
Tap-tap. Pause. Tap.
A pattern, musical. Not a code she recognized, but one that felt too deliberate to be random.
She unlatched the bolt.
And found herself staring down at an enormous black dog.
He sat neatly on the mat, rain still slicking his fur. Around his neck was a silver collar inscribed with symbols that shimmered in the candlelight but refused to stay still. His ears were alert. His amber eyes gleamed with something that was not merely animal intelligence—but awareness. Comprehension. Judgment.
He wore a bow tie.
""Bonsoir, Mademoiselle Beaumont,"" the dog said, in perfect Parisian French. His voice was low, resonant, and oddly genteel—like a retired actor offering lines from a play he knew by heart.
Marguerite blinked.
The door stayed open.
“I assure you this is not a hallucination brought on by fatigue,” the dog said. “My name is Selapin. I serve Monsieur Virel. He has requested your presence. There is a matter of some urgency.”
Marguerite, whose world had long since stopped obeying the rules of reason, did not slam the door. Nor did she scream. She simply stood there, studying the creature. Her heart thudded once, then settled.
“Do all of his messengers wear bow ties?”
“Only the dignified ones,” said Selapin.
Behind her, Sophie whispered, “Maman... there’s a dog talking at the door.”
“I noticed,” Marguerite murmured.
She stepped aside. The dog did not enter.
“Why me?” she asked.
“You have become something rare in this city,” Selapin replied. “A weaver of escapes. A seamstress of possibility. My master believes you are prepared to sew something larger than fabric.”
“Does this... proposal involve danger?” she asked.
“I would be concerned if it didn’t,” Selapin said.
Marguerite’s hand tightened around the needle case she had unconsciously picked up from the table.
“Where?”
“Opéra Garnier. Midnight. Box Seven. You will not be alone.”
“And if I decline?”
Selapin tilted his head. “Then this conversation never happened. And perhaps the child in your window vanishes tomorrow.”
Marguerite exhaled, as if someone had struck her in the lungs.
“Very well,” she said. “I’ll come.”
The dog bowed deeply. “Dress warmly. The theater has not been heated in decades.”
And with that, he turned, padded down the hallway, and disappeared into the shadows of the stairwell as quietly as snowfall.
Marguerite closed the door.
Behind her, the candlelight flickered once. A thread on the table unspooled slightly, twisting of its own accord into the shape of a question mark.
She sat down.
She began to sew again.
But her hands, so long steady, now moved with the hush of premonition.

Chapter 3: The Devil's Bargain

The meeting took place in the abandoned Opera House, a relic of pre-war grandeur where dust usually danced with echoes and time wore its finest shoes. But that night, the great hall was awake.
The box they entered should have been sealed and choked with cobwebs, but instead gleamed with supernatural light. Gas sconces burned with a blue flame that cast no shadow. The velvet seats were immaculate. Below, the stage was empty, yet the heavy red curtain shifted, as if a performance were preparing itself from the other side.
Marcel Dubois and Marguerite Beaumont stood at the edge of the box in silence.
“I dreamed of this place once,” Marguerite said quietly, clutching the sleeve of her coat. “But it was underwater.”
Marcel did not answer. He was staring at the figure seated in the center of the box—Monsieur Virel. The stranger now looked more regal than eccentric, his posture effortlessly composed, his eyes gleaming in the unnatural light.
To his left sat Selapin, the black-furred dog with the eyes of an old judge. The dog’s silver collar was inscribed with sigils Marcel did not recognize, but which his mind recoiled from, as if they'd been etched into some primal memory.
To Virel’s right was Mercutio, the silent man in the plum-colored coat. He stood instead of sitting, perfectly still, hands gloved, one eye hidden behind a shard of tinted glass. Marcel had not seen him enter. Marguerite suspected he had been there all along.
And beside them, the woman.
She was clad in a dress made of nightfall and starlight, her hair curled like obsidian waves, her eyes too large for her face and too ancient for her skin. She gave them a smile that promised pleasure and punishment in the same breath, and then leaned back as if she’d just finished a song only she could hear.
Marcel finally spoke.
“I assume we are not here for coffee.”
Virel laughed, warm and cold at once.
“No. You are here because time is short, and choices are overdue.”
He gestured to the empty seats across from him. With some hesitation, the professor and the seamstress sat. Marguerite kept her hands clasped tight in her lap. Marcel placed his manuscript on the table between them, as if offering a shield.
“The German occupation,” Virel began, “is a crucible. It is a test, a riddle, a stage. And like all stages, it requires a performance. I am here to help cast the final act.”
“And what role do we play?” Marcel asked. His voice, for all its effort to remain steady, cracked like brittle parchment.
“You,” said Virel, pointing a single finger tipped in gold, “are the scribe. The philosopher. The one who insists that good exists even when the world says otherwise. And you,” he turned to Marguerite, “are the artisan. The one who can sew a torn world back together stitch by desperate stitch.”
Marguerite tilted her head. “That sounds poetic, but meaningless. Who are you really?”
Virel’s smile vanished. The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees.
“I am what walks beside humanity when it forgets it has a soul. I am the weight behind a whisper, the itch in the conscience of cowards. I am what kings pray to when victory tastes like ash. But tonight”—he raised his hands as though conducting an invisible orchestra—“tonight I am merely the host of a wager.”
He snapped his fingers. A sheet of music unfolded itself from the air and hovered over the opera stage. The notes rearranged themselves, fluttering like birds, forming images instead of melody.
They saw Paris as it was now—its bones wrapped in blackout curtains, its arteries patrolled by men with machine guns. Then they saw it as it might be tomorrow. Smoke pouring from hidden cellars. The cries of children dragged into trucks. The hush of those who knew, and said nothing.
“The Gestapo,” Virel said softly, “plans a full sweep of resistance safehouses tomorrow night. Precision raids. No mercy. They will find the Rosenbergs and the Lebowitz twins. They will find every family whose names you both have risked everything to protect.”
“How do you know that?” Marguerite’s voice was almost a whisper.
“I don’t know it. I see it.”
“Then stop it,” Marcel demanded. “If you’re what you claim—some demon, angel, trickster, judge—then intervene.”
“Oh, Professor,” Virel said with something like pity. “You still think this is about power. It never is. It’s always about permission. Always about the moment someone ordinary becomes something else.”
He leaned forward, resting his elbows on invisible light.
“I can prevent the massacre. But only if you give me something in return.”
There was a silence, not the kind made of quiet, but the kind made of fear opening a door inside the soul.
“Our souls?” Marcel said, though he knew the answer.
Virel rolled his eyes, theatrically. “Not in the way you imagine. No contracts. No burning signatures. No violin lessons in hell. I want you to prove your souls exist. That they are still capable of wonder and mercy and love. You, Professor, will write what happens next—not as a treatise, but as a story. Not ideas, but people. Lives. Grace.”
He turned to Marguerite. “And you will save them. Not by force, but by design. You will outwit the devils in uniform. You will turn cloth into keys, identities into escapes. You will be what Paris remembers.”
“And what if we fail?” she asked.
Virel raised a hand. The images shifted again. They saw streets running red. Cells overcrowded. A line of people shuffling toward a train in the snow.
“If you fail, I win the wager. And Paris becomes just another city that proved me right.”
“And if we refuse?” Marcel asked.
“Then you never got this meeting. And tomorrow night, it all ends.”
They sat in silence. Selapin rose and walked to Marguerite. He placed his enormous head on her knee and looked up into her eyes. Something passed between them—an old sorrow, perhaps, or a promise made before language existed.
Marguerite touched the dog’s ear. “I’ll do it. Not for you. For them.”
Marcel looked at her, and for a long time he said nothing. Then he picked up his manuscript, opened it, and tore out the first five pages.
“They were the ones that tried to explain everything,” he said.
Virel clapped his hands. “Marvelous. The curtain rises. The final act begins.”
Below, the opera curtain swelled like a wave. Somewhere, in the pit, unseen instruments began to tune.


Chapter 4: The Great Ball

What followed was a night that would be remembered in whispers and dreams, though most who witnessed it would convince themselves it was merely a fever dream brought on by hunger and fear.
The ball at the German officers’ club began like any other display of imperial arrogance. Crystal chandeliers glimmered above uniforms weighted with stolen medals. A Viennese string quartet played with mechanical perfection while officers drank champagne looted from Bordeaux cellars and danced with pale Parisian hostesses whose eyes never quite met theirs.
But then the air changed.
At precisely midnight, the clock on the grand staircase stopped ticking. Not slowed—stopped, as if time itself had turned its face away. A chill moved through the ballroom, subtle at first, like the breath of something ancient stirring beneath the floor.
And then the doors opened.
They were not thrown open, nor pushed, nor unlocked. They simply parted, like curtains drawn back from a stage. Through them stepped the guests of Monsieur Virel.
Selapin entered first, his enormous paws silent against the marble. The orchestra faltered for just a beat before playing on, as if compelled by something unseen. Selapin's golden eyes scanned the room with calm authority as he moved through the crowd like a shadow given purpose.
Behind him came Mercutio, the man in the plum coat. He did not speak. He did not smile. He simply walked, as though each step weighed more than the last century. Those who looked into his eyes saw their own secrets staring back at them.
Then came the dancers.
They arrived in pairs, draped in elegance and moonlight. Their clothes shimmered with anachronisms—gowns from the Belle Époque, uniforms from a long-dead empire, masks that resembled animals with human mouths. They glided across the floor, spinning into the arms of stunned officers and socialites who could not resist the invitation. The music changed. The violins moaned. The cellos wept. Every note sounded like a lament sung backwards.
At first, the Nazis believed it a prank, some strange Parisian performance art. But as the dances continued, reality frayed at the edges.
One lieutenant twirled with a beautiful woman in a red velvet dress, only to realize her skin was ash and her perfume smelled of burning paper. A major found himself locked in a waltz with a child in a hospital gown whose eyes had no whites, only blackness. A general in full regalia laughed at a joke whispered by a man in a top hat, until he saw the man had no mouth at all.
General Heinrich Müller, chief of the Gestapo in Paris, stood frozen on the dais, his face gone gray. A little girl approached him slowly, barefoot on the polished floor. She wore a yellow star on her torn dress and carried a wilted bouquet of violets. Her chest was smeared with blood, the bullet hole through her heart like a second mouth.
She curtsied.
""May I have this dance?"" she asked, in a voice neither sweet nor cruel, but eternal.
Müller, who had ordered hundreds of raids with the stroke of a pen, who had watched families torn apart like packages on Christmas morning, found that he could not refuse. His hands trembled as he took hers. They moved in silence through the crowd. No one else dared interrupt.
""Why did you kill me?"" she asked as they turned.
""I was following orders,"" he replied hoarsely, not looking at her.
""Whose orders?"" she asked again, her face lifted toward his. ""God’s? The Devil’s? Or just afraid men hiding behind uniforms?""
He had no answer. He never would.
Above them, the chandelier pulsed with a strange light. It flickered not with electricity but with the slow, breathing glow of candle flames that had never been lit. Mirrors reflected scenes that were not in the room—villages burning, trains moving through snow, women hiding in cupboards clutching their children’s mouths closed.
Monsieur Virel stood on the upper balcony, watching with serene interest. He held a goblet filled with something that shimmered like liquid dusk. He raised it in salute to the chaos unfolding below.
""This,"" he said softly to no one in particular, ""is what happens when you silence the poets and burn the libraries. The soul does not die. It dances.""
Selapin padded up to him and sat, tail curled neatly beside his paws.
""They won’t remember any of it,"" said the dog. ""Not clearly.""
""No,"" Virel agreed. ""They’ll say it was fog or food poisoning or madness. But in their dreams, they’ll remember. And when they die, they’ll remember everything.""
Mercutio appeared beside them, silent and still. He stared down at the ballroom floor, his expression unreadable.
A colonel fell to his knees, weeping, arms outstretched to a partner who had become a cloud of smoke in his arms. A hostess screamed and then laughed and then vanished altogether, her laughter lingering like perfume. An SS officer tried to draw his pistol, but found it was made of bone and covered in names he had never spoken aloud.
The music rose and fell. The dance continued.
And when it ended, there was silence, so thick and vast it felt like velvet pressed to the mouth of the world.
The ghosts were gone. The lights flickered. The orchestra collapsed in exhaustion. No one moved. No one spoke.
Except for the little girl with the yellow star, who turned once on the empty floor and smiled.


Chapter 5: The Morning After

Dawn crept slowly over Paris like a reluctant guest. The city, still wrapped in its familiar gray veil, seemed at first unchanged—as if the night had been nothing but a restless dream. The smoke from the fireplaces and factories mingled with the morning fog, blurring the edges of rooftops and church spires. But beneath the surface, something had shifted.
The German administration of Paris had collapsed into chaos.
In the government offices, clerks stared blankly at empty desks where files had once been meticulously catalogued. The Gestapo headquarters echoed with frantic whispers as officers searched for orders that no longer existed. Radios crackled with static and confusion; telephones rang unanswered. Rumors spread faster than any official report.
Some called it mass hysteria. Others whispered of divine intervention.
But in the quiet corners of Montmartre, real miracles were happening.
Marguerite Beaumont sat by the window of her cramped apartment, her hands folded tightly in her lap. The first rays of sunlight filtered through the worn curtains, casting a warm glow over the small room cluttered with sewing tools, papers, and faded photographs. The air smelled faintly of fresh bread and rain-damp stone.
The Rosenbergs—now no longer just shadows hiding from death—moved about the room with cautious smiles. Sophie, her cheeks flushed with hope for the first time in months, held a new bundle in her arms: a forged birth certificate for a younger brother who had never existed before.
Marguerite had given them new names, new papers, and new paths to freedom. The documents were crafted so well that no one would question their authenticity. Every stitch, every line of ink, every whispered lie had been designed to unravel the Gestapo’s web.
Outside, the city began to stir with life—windows thrown open, children laughing on cobbled streets, vendors calling out their wares. The rhythm of resistance, the pulse of survival, had found new strength.
Meanwhile, Marcel Dubois sat at his battered desk in a tiny flat near the Latin Quarter. His manuscript lay before him, transformed. The careful philosophical treatise on the equality of human souls had dissolved into something far more alive—a story, raw and vivid, of the night’s impossible events. The pages trembled with the voices of those he had come to know—the seamstress, the dog with eyes like judgment, the silent man, and the stranger who wore two different colors in his gaze.
The words spoke of magic and terror, love and sacrifice, and above all, of hope.
Marcel read the final lines again, tracing the delicate script with a trembling finger:
“In the darkest times, love is the only light that never fades.”
He set down his pen and looked out the window.
Paris was waking up.
Marguerite appeared in the doorway, her eyes shining with exhaustion and relief.
“They’re safe,” she said simply.
Marcel nodded, standing to meet her. They shared a glance heavy with understanding—two souls who had witnessed the impossible and had survived to tell the tale.
“Did it really happen?” Marguerite asked, her voice barely a whisper.
Marcel smiled faintly.
“Does it matter?” he replied, taking her hand. “The important thing is that it’s true.”
Outside, the city’s heartbeat quickened. People began to emerge from hiding places, from basements, from the shadows. A mother sang to her child on a balcony. A group of friends clasped hands in a quiet circle. A violinist lifted her bow to strings that sang hope into the morning air.
The war was not over. The darkness still lingered at the edges. But for the first time in months, Paris dared to dream again.
And sometimes, late at night, when the city is quiet and the moon is full, visitors to the Café de Flore might glimpse a tall man with mismatched eyes sitting alone in a corner, raising his glass in a silent toast to the enduring mystery of human nature.
The needle and the pen, the seamstress and the professor, the dog and the stranger—all threads woven into the same great tapestry.
A tapestry that reminds us, always, that even in the darkest hours, light finds a way.

Epilogue: The Master's Work
Years later, when the war was over and the city was free, Marcel's book would be published. Critics would call it a work of magical realism, a fantastical allegory of resistance during the occupation. They would praise its imagination while dismissing its literal truth.
But in the margins of history, in the whispered stories of those who lived through that night, the truth persisted. Sometimes, when the world grows too dark, when human cruelty threatens to overwhelm human kindness, the universe itself intervenes. Not with obvious miracles, but with the quiet magic of love persisting, of courage flowering in the darkest soil, of ordinary people choosing to be extraordinary.
And sometimes, late at night in Paris, visitors to Café de Flore might glimpse a tall man with mismatched eyes, sitting alone at a corner table, raising his glass in a toast to the enduring mystery of human nature. At his feet might lie a large black dog with glowing eyes and an ageless patience. And somewhere near the door, a man in a plum coat may linger just out of sight, watching in silence.
The needle and the pen, the seamstress and the professor, the devil and the divine, all part of the same great tapestry that weaves itself through history, reminding us that in the darkest hours, light finds a way.

When you speak to a retiree who funds scholarships versus a Gen-Z monthly giver, tailor stories, imagery, and asks to the dream that sparks their generosity. Relevance makes every update feel like a letter written just for them.


🤝 Prove impact in real time. Replace abstract stats with vivid mini-victories: “Your $25 put three kids back in class today.” Concrete proof triggers dopamine, trust, and a near-irresistible urge to repeat the feel-good act.


🔄 Keep the narrative rhythm. Touch base every quarter with value-packed stories, insider photos, and lessons learned—not merely fundraising pleas. Momentum turns episodic giving into an unfolding saga donors can’t wait to follow.


🎁 Delight with surprises. Hand-written notes, backstage livestreams, or an impromptu coffee chat with your CEO whisper, “We see you.” That unexpected warmth burns longer than any automated receipt.


📈 Invite co-creation. Poll donors on upcoming initiatives, crowd-source campaign names, or open a Slack channel for feedback. When supporters shape the journey, they leap from back-row spectators to front-row champions.


✨ Celebrate them loudly and personally. Spotlight anniversaries, create honor rolls, or name micro-milestones after your stalwarts. Recognition not only melts hearts—it signals to newcomers that loyalty is visible and valued.

First Fourth of July Celebration at Philadelphia’s City Tavern Igniting a New Nation’s Traditions","**First Fourth of July Celebration at Philadelphia’s City Tavern Igniting a New Nation’s Traditions**

Working on the Fourth of July, while others celebrate, is not new. In July of 1777, months before battles raged and freedom hung by a thread, Philadelphia’s City Tavern opened its doors to a small circle of patriots. They gathered not for politics but to raise a glass, and for the first time to mark July 4 as a day of celebration¹. This modest act, in a dimly lit room of wood and candle smoke, set a tradition that echoes through every backyard grill and fireworks sky today.

**From Humble Beginnings**

City Tavern opened in late 1773, by 53 prominent citizens eager to give their growing city a grand meeting place. Daniel Smith signed the first lease in December of that year for £300 per year, roughly five years’ wages for a laborer². The new tavern boasted five floors, three dining rooms, two coffee rooms, a bar room, and servants’ quarters². Above it all stood the second-largest ballroom on the continent.

In May of 1774, Paul Revere rode in with word that Parliament had closed Boston’s port³. Two hundred men promptly gathered at City Tavern to draft a letter of sympathy and resolve⁴. By autumn, delegates of the First Continental Congress slipped in and out of the tavern doors between sessions at Carpenter’s Hall³. Among them were George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Richard Henry Lee.

**A Feast for Freedom**

On July 4, 1777, the war had burned for two years, and spirits ran both low and high. City Tavern hosted the first Independence Day celebration in a simple but bold gesture of unity and hope⁵. The menu likely lacked hot dogs and hamburgers but brimmed with colonial staples. Fish house punch, rum, brandy, lemon, sugar, and tea flowed freely⁶. Pepperpot stew simmered layers of meat, peppers, and spices in a communal pot.

Patriots stood in clusters by wooden tables, swapping tales of the front lines and hopes for peace. Mary Thompson, whose diary survives, later wrote, “The punch was sharp as our resolve, and the stew thick with promise”⁷. A short speech praised the fallen, cheered the living, and blessed the declaration that now bore fruit in the fields and firesides of a new nation.

**The Rise of a Landmark**

In the months that followed, City Tavern became the Continental Army’s headquarters from August 3 to 5, 1777⁸. Washington and his aides sketched strategies over bowls of beef and ale⁹. In September 1787, just days after appending their names to the Constitution, the framers dined together in its northwest dining room, John Adams calling it, “the most genteel tavern in America”¹⁰.

Through the early republic, the tavern hosted banquets for John Jay’s election as president of Congress and feted George Washington on his way to New York for his inauguration in 1789¹¹. Its native yellow pine floors creaked beneath the boots of soldiers and statesmen alike.

**Fire, Loss, and Revival**

Fate struck on March 22, 1834, when a blaze tore through the roof¹². The building limped on for two more decades before final demolition in 1854¹³. For over a century, only a marker and memory stood on the corner of 2nd and Walnut.

In 1975, as America prepared for its Bicentennial, a faithful reconstruction rose from period images, insurance surveys, and written accounts¹⁴. By July 4, 1976, City Tavern 2.0 opened, staffed by costumed servers and anchored by recipes of pepperpot, turkey pot pie, and Sally Lunn bread¹⁵. Yet it welcomed modern tastes too, from fried tofu to iced tea.

Under chef Walter Staib’s direction from 1994, the menu blended centuries, each dish served with stories of Ben Franklin’s experiments and Washington’s labels on porter beer¹⁶. Staib’s PBS show **A Taste of History** carried City Tavern’s story into homes across America, winning 13 Emmys.

**Closure and the Path Forward**

In November of 2020, the clatter of tankards fell silent. The pandemic dampened tables, and the National Park Service sought a new operator¹⁷. As of 2025, the search continues, with hopes that City Tavern 3.0 might open in time for the Semiquincentennial.

Today, we link July 4 with grills and fireworks. Yet long before hot dogs hissed on charcoal and rockets flared over riverbanks, City Tavern hosted the first true celebration of American independence. Its stones have echoed with the voices of patriots, its hearth warmed by their meals, and its legacy lives on in every toast to liberty.

My robot-obsessed spouse, my parents, and, yeah, me too!

With an extra three hundred sixty-five reclaimed hours, I am daydreaming of my weekends where:

\* An AquaSense Ultra has been hard at work overnight, **addressing the sand** evening breezes have introduced to our pool.  My morning coffee is enjoyed while looking at my perfectly vacuumed, sparkling pool instead of thinking of contemplating a fight with the vacuum hose.

\* **The pumice stone is relegated to my feet** \- given that our hard water is no match for the AquaSense Ultra's waterline feature on our black and white cabana-striped tile

\* Those bougainvillea petals - while gorgeous to look at on the plant - are magenta menaces.  They float, they turn nearly invisible after they've lost their color - they're **bougain-villains on my pool's surface** ... and they're no match for the AquaSense Ultra's surface cleaning cycle

""But you live in an arid climate, sean5280...what hours would be reclaimed with the Eufy?"" you ask....

The Eufy...**would be a gift** ... to my parents.  They've **retired**, and enjoy a quiet rural life - but their yard - it's HUGE.  Takes a lot for Dad to keep up with it.  (They'd be horrified if I even suggested they're more mature and less energetic than they once were.  Don't tell them I said that!!)

So that's got me imagining a weekend where:

\* Dad has the energy and time to play his beloved pickleball instead of burning hours and energy on his heavily-wooded, very grassy yard.

\* Mom's headed to golf or to volunteer instead of raking all those grass clippings

\* They are relaxing - in these years where they've earned that relaxation

The only flaw in my plan?  We've all done it - I'll be remote tech support for my folks.  How could I complain about a getting a call or FaceTime from them?  Even that's a gift.

I’m developing a caramel latte drink sachet that mixes with hot water — kind of like what Costa or Starbucks do, but with creatine added (for gym heads who want flavour + function).

Here’s the issue:
I’ve tried caramel flavouring powder from Flavour World (UK), and it tastes like straight chemicals when mixed — not even close to caramel. Not rich, not creamy, just a weird artificial aftertaste.

Here’s what’s in my test sachet:
	•	6g skimmed milk powder
	•	2.5g instant coffee
	•	3g stevia + erythritol
	•	0.6–0.8g caramel flavour powder
	•	5g creatine
	•	180ml hot water to mix

I tried masking it with a pinch of salt, but honestly… it didn’t help at all. The flavour still tasted fake and unpleasant. It’s not just weak — it’s bad. Not even my girlfriend thought it tasted like caramel.

I’m looking into OOOFlavors’ Salted Caramel Powder, but before I buy it:
	•	Has anyone actually used it in dry sachets or powdered drinks (not just protein shakes or baking)?
	•	Does it taste clean and caramel-like at small doses (0.5g–1g)?
	•	Do you still need to mask it or blend it with vanilla/salt/etc?
	•	Or is there a better flavour supplier I should be trying for natural-tasting caramel?

This is the last piece I need to get right before I launch, and I want the taste to actually be good, not something I have to apologise for.

Any help would mean a lot 🙏

1lrr2mi,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFWr4rIndia/comments/1lrr2mi/26_m4fbangalore_ice_cream_art_and_some_mildly/,"26 [M4F][Bangalore] - Ice cream, art, and some mildly deep conversation?","
Weekends slip by faster than they should. So how about we hit pause on doomscrolling, step out of our comfort zones (and pajamas), and do something refreshingly different?

Maybe we start with a visit to a museum or art gallery—where we pretend to “get” abstract art while secretly rating the frame choices and color palettes like undercover critics. From there, we wander into one of Bangalore’s greener corners or stumble through a colorful market, just soaking in the chaos or calm, depending on the mood. When our feet (or attention spans) give out, we settle into a cozy café for coffee, or maybe cool off with ice cream that feels way too indulgent for the weather. 

And if the conversation’s still flowing, who knows—maybe a spontaneous detour to a bookshop rounds off the day just right.

About me:
26, tech guy, semi-professional overthinker, full-time curious soul. I like swimming, spontaneous treks, and exploring cafés that look like they were built for rainy days and long chats. On weekends, I alternate between doing absolutely nothing and everything at once.

P.S. Whoever’s late buys dessert. No debates. ",1,1751656859.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

1lrr0zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1lrr0zt/29_no_degree_seeking_employment_while_taking_care/,"29, no degree, seeking employment while taking care of disabled father. What career paths can I go for that won't conflict with the care?","Hello, everyone, first time here. I've come here because I've decided trying to figure this out on my own isn't enough anymore. And I feel like I'm running out of time or wasting it the more I try to.

I'm currently 29 years old and one of the primary caretakers of my 61-year-old disabled father. He has Type-2 diabetes, end-stage congestive heart failure, had a stroke a couple years back, reduced vision due to occlusions in both eyes from diabetic retinopathy, and is always at home now with an infusion. My whole family is on Medi-Cal, so everything is covered, especially for him. We're also waiting on an appeal for the denial of SSA Disability benefits. I'm surprised we even *had* to file an appeal, but I digress. The only income we're receiving are LTD payments from a private insurance company as a benefit from his work. I'm the only person capable of driving him to medical appointments and the primary spokesperson when it comes to coordination/communication with medical staff, social workers, lawyers, etc.I currently have no degree and have been on off college due to the amount of mental and physical load from this sort of care. Please note that I am *not* blaming him for it. I love my father and don't regret a single moment in caring for him. And I'd do it all again if I had to. I'm just being realistic for my mental health because I would be a fool to pretend like this is nothing. The only regrets I have are not having a career prior to further support him.

My two majors I've worked towards and have interest in are Elementary Education and Computer Science:

* Elementary Education because I've always been told (even until now) that I'm a great teacher/tutor in helping others learn a new skill/topic. I'm also great with kids and love helping people, so the job feels fulfilling. I figured if I want to invest in the future, why not invest in the people of the future?
* Computer Science because I like math, computers and coding is quite fun for me. It would also allow WFH opportunities so I can continue caring for my family. I just started this major about a semester ago, with only one course allowed due to academic probation.

I've completed about 85% of general reqs, so the rest of the courses (about 12) I'd need for my associate's are major-related courses that also count towards the missing general reqs.

But I've grown weary of the idea of continuing 4-year degrees. So my current interest are into vocational/trade/tech schools. I realized over the years that I'm a hands-on and visual learner, so this feels like a better fit. Currently, I'm interested in pharmacy and waiting on a call back from an inquiry I made of a pharmacy tech program. I'm a math and science guy, so learning about medication tickles that part of my brain. They seem to be quite in demand around here, but if I decide to go into it, I'd like to work in the hospital. However, from what I've read, there isn't much to grow from being a pharmacy tech aside from specialties, so that's why I'm here.

My work experience is mostly in customer service, with 4 years at boba shops/cafes and about 7 months in retail. Cashiering, sales, inventory management and even food prep. I'm good at what I do and often get compliments on my service. Overall, I enjoy interacting with people, just not the minimum wage it's tied to. Actually, my dream is to open up a cafe someday because I love the idea of providing a safe space to unwind, relax with the aroma of coffee, tea, and food, and be there to serve a smile, especially for those having tough days. But I've got a long way before I can get to that point.

What kind of careers could I look into that'll allow me to both sustain myself and family, while caring for my father? Or should I stick to the current progress on those two majors?

How could I look for these sort of careers myself?

We have no plans of us moving outside of San Diego since my dad is still paying for the house and we've been here almost our whole lives. It is expensive to live in SD, but it is home nonetheless.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Sorry for the huge wall of text, felt like I needed to cover all the bases. Please let me know if you need any additional information or even a resume.",2,1751656735.0,careerguidance,2,1.0,False

She did say i would get a min amount of hours per week which im fine with, but she said if i wanted to pick up extra shifts they would be in an app? How does that work?

This month I had a sprain which I can imagine delayed my ovulation. Which I didn’t think about until after I ovulated, the day after I had unprotected fill me the f up sex. This was two Saturdays ago.

I didn’t take one of those ovulation tests because I’m not TTC but the day after the sex we had, I felt a disco in my belly and I felt like I was so hungry for sex it made me emotional. Which is not normal for me bc I have had low sex drive the last two years. I wanted to go another 150,000 times. 

The first week after the deed I had none of the PMDD symptoms that I usually have. No crying, no sadness, no crazy desire for carbs or chocolate, this week it’s still the same. 

On Wednesday cramps started kicking in which given the timeline, could allude to implantation. It felt kind of like a tickly pinch in my left lower back. When I stretched my whole uterus felt like it had a stitch?

I tested yesterday impulsively in the middle of the day after already doing 10 wee wees and I saw the faintest line that could actually just be a creation in my brain. I’ve decided I’m going to wait a few days to test again because those little lines can be faint too early and also because if I get my period first then I won’t feel like a jacka&& for buying more tests than necessary. 

I can’t drink coffee without feeling like I’m going to levitate. My eyes are weird and I can’t explain it. It’s almost like my frame rate has decreased ever so slightly. I’m farting and sneezing and so exhausted.

To be VERY CLEAR - Ironmace nor myself will have any direct or indirect monetary benefit from this charity event.  It will not be streamed on my personal channel and Ironmace does not handle any funds. Ironmace was also not compensated in any way for any of the in-game items that they produced for GCX in 2024, nor in 2025.*

  
In 2022, standing on the floor of Twitchcon just outside of artist's alley, my mom called me to tell me that her sister, my aunt... the lady that taught me how to party when I was younger... had been diagnosed with an inoperable stage 4 sarcoma on her pulmonary artery.  She passed due to complications from her cancer in mid-April of this year.  Unfortunately, nearly everyone reading this post has a similar story, and I'm trying to change that in any way that I can.

I really, really hate cancer.

Last year I wrote a dm to Terry asking if I could get a couple of game keys or a coffee bundle or something to give away during a 4 hour block of time that I was given for the GCX Charity Marathon.  GCX is a gaming convention that takes place in Orlando, FL and a week or two prior they do a 7-day-long charity marathon comprised of multiple content creators that all do 4 hour blocks in an attempt to raise money for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

Since 1962, St. Jude has been a non-profit research hospital who's primary focus is on attempting to cure children plagued by a variety of life-threatening diseases, the largest one being cancer.  They are wholly-run on donations from the public, and are regarded as one of the most efficiently-run charities in the world.  $0.84 of every $1 that is donated goes directly toward patient care and research and the FAMILIES that attend are able to do so at zero cost.  Treatment, food, housing, clothing, etc is all provided by St. Jude.

Terry responded 2 days before I was supposed to go live for my charity block saying that SDF wanted to include an in-game item instead - a torch skin - of which the GCX charity torch was born, and most all of us at this point own.

That torch skin was $5, a price I set.  I got a bunch of pushback from the folks running GCX.  ""Are you sure you don't want it to be more? Usually we do like a $60 price point for the Destiny stuff"".  Nope. $5.

That created a new donation meta.

**The torch skin was purchased over 58,000 times.**  During my marathon block we raised over $148,000 and I got the torch tattooed on my forearm to commemorate it.  Over the following 4 days, the community in total raised $375,000 for St. Jude.  For the longest time I had a personal fundraising goal of raising more money for charity than I earned in a calendar year.  We blew that out of the water last year in just a handful of hours.

All because of a torch skin in-game.  We, collectively, were the #1 fundraiser for the entire charity marathon.  We out-performed everyone, even the largest content creators in the lineup....**and we began mid-week.**

This year it is different.

**This year I will be kicking off the charity marathon instead of starting in the middle.  This year I will be live at** ***NOON EST (5PM GMT) - 4PM EST (9PM GMT) ON MONDAY, JULY 14TH ON THE ""GCXEVENT"" TWITCH CHANNEL.***

We have an opportunity to do something even greater than last year, and I have a goal of $500,000 for the week.  I believe we can accomplish this given the additional timeframe.

**FOR YOUR DONATION, should you choose to make one, there will be TWO in-game items this year.  They will, again, be $5 each via Tiltify, who will provide steam keys for the items upon checkout from the website**

**Item 1:** A GCX Campfire in the colors of the GCX logo  
**Item 2:** A ""confetti popper"" emote.

*THESE WILL* ***ONLY*** *BE AVAILABLE DURING THE MARATHON AND WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE AGAIN*

I pushed SUPER HARD for the 2nd one.  

At St. Jude they have what are called ""No More Chemo"" parties.  When someone is discharged from the hospital, they throw a party for each child complete with cake, party favors, and ... of course... confetti blasters.  So in the spirit of this, I pushed to have them make a ""confetti popper"" emote so we can celebrate in the dungeon... naturally... right?...

(...but we all know that the true nature of this emote will be to stand over the corpses of your enemies and pop confetti after a hard-fought victory, right?)    
  
**DUAL PURPOSE EMOTE LETS GOOO.**

So... in the spirit of competition, I ask that you please join me on the 14th of July to raise some money for some very sick kids and help St. Jude BoC lock halberd 1-tap cancer in the face, and if you cannot donate yourself, just come celebrate the massive W that this community is able to provide for people and maybe mention it to a friend or loved one.

I am so absurdly proud of this community through everything.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart for being as accepting of me as you have been, allowing me to entertain you over the years, and even though a lot of us aren't holding the line, for still holding the torch.

See you in the dungeon.

1lrqrqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1lrqrqi/water_and_occupation/,Water and Occupation,"Gaza’s water “comes from wells with salt water unfit for consumption. They have water treatment plants, Israel should hit those plants. When the entire world says we have gone insane and this is a humanitarian disaster — we will say, it’s not an end, it’s a means.” That was the opinion of Giora Eiland, adviser to the defense minister and former head of the Israeli National Security Council, writing in Yedioth Ahronoth on October 9, 2023.⁠^(\[1\])

Already by November, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights warned that “around 70% of the population in Gaza is drinking salinised and contaminated water.”⁠^(\[2\]) By July 2024, Oxfam reported that “people in Gaza have had only 4.74 litres of water per person per day” since the start of Israel’s offensive,⁠^(\[3\]) well below the World Health Organization’s minimum needed for survival in a humanitarian emergency.⁠^(\[4\])

Israel's control over life’s most essential resource did not arise overnight. After occupying Gaza and the West Bank in 1967, it quickly established a system to extract water for its own use while restricting Palestinian access. For decades, this policy forced the indigenous population into dependence and precarity, while Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories — illegal under international law⁠^(\[5\]) — enjoyed “privileged access to water.”⁠^(\[6\])

# Codifying Control, 1967 to 1993

By 1967, Israel was already “pumping and siphoning off underground waters of the West Bank,” using wells drilled inside its own territory. This “constituted five-sixths of the West Bank waters.”⁠^(\[7\]) In fact, in a top-secret 1949 telegram  — just a year after Israel’s founding — the U.S. Under Secretary of State reported that the British Foreign Secretary had expressed concern about the “situation arising from Israeli claims to territory \[on\] both sides \[of\] upper Jordan which would give them complete control \[of\] all water resources.”⁠^(\[8\])

Two months after seizing the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, Israeli authorities issued the first of three orders on water in the West Bank. This August 1967 order placed all authority over water access and use under the military.⁠^(\[9\])

A second order, issued in November, required a permit to own, operate, or build any system for extracting or processing water. These permits could only be obtained from military authorities, who could refuse them “without giving any explanation.”⁠^(\[10\]) 

The following year, a third order granted the Israeli Military Area Commander power to revoke any water and land transactions, even those previously ratified by a civil court.⁠^(\[11\])

Israeli exploitation extended to all three water sources in the Occupied Palestinian Territories: the Jordan River, the Mountain Aquifer, and the Coastal Aquifer⁠^(\[12\]) (the aquifers are underground water reserves, tapped through wells). Between 1967 and 1990, 53% of land in the West Bank and 42% of land in the Gaza Strip was confiscated.⁠^(\[13\]) Since then, Palestinians have been denied access to the Jordan River’s water.⁠^(\[14\]) Agricultural settlements were also established “on the most fertile land” and sites with abundant groundwater.⁠^(\[15\])  

“Israeli authorities have exercised firm control over Palestinian water resources,” reported the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 1989, adding, “Some 460 of the 720 Palestinian wells in existence prior to 1967 have been destroyed, have dried up or have been expropriated.”⁠^(\[16\])

While 36 deep-bore artesian wells were “drilled for use by Israel and its settlements” since 1967, the report notes, only five new wells were “permitted for Palestinian use.”⁠^(\[17\]) A separate U.N. report counted seven permits granted from 1967 to 1980, and noted that even when Israel granted Palestinians these permits to drill wells — “under heavy public pressure” — it did so only for domestic use, not irrigation.⁠^(\[18\]) 

In the 1970s, Israel also started requiring the installation of meters on wells in the occupied territories, allowing only “meager quantities of extraction” to Palestinians.⁠^(\[19\]) These quotas were “woefully inadequate to meet the population’s needs.”⁠^(\[20\])

Israeli settlement plans accompanied the exploitation of water. In July 1967, Labor Minister Yigal Allon presented a plan that included a proposal for the occupied West Bank. “The so-called ‘Allon Plan,’ submitted to the cabinet on July 26, was never formally adopted as government (or even Labor Party) policy; but it was to remain the unwritten platform of Israel’s Labor-led governments down to 1977, and of Labor in opposition thereafter,” Israeli historian Benny Morris notes.⁠^(\[21\])

Water played a central role in shaping the proposed map. According to Morris, the Allon Plan would have Israel “retain a six–seven-mile-deep strip along the west bank of the Jordan \[River\].”⁠^(\[22\]) 

The CIA criticized the plan in a confidential 1969 memo, stating that “Israel unrealistically feels that the Allon Plan is a workable solution.” It warned that the plan would perpetuate boundaries that “isolate people in a subsistence economy,” and would turn the West Bank into “another Gaza Strip—larger in area and population but burdened by the same inadequate resources.”⁠^(\[23\])

“In 1970, the \[settlement\] efforts were directed mainly at making the Allon plan operational, a plan which provided for the annexation of a third of the West Bank, including the Jordan Valley,” a 1980 U.N. committee study noted. “Five of the six settlements established by Israel that year were in the fertile valley of the Jordan.”⁠^(\[24\])

The settlement enterprise came at the expense of Palestinian water access. Residents of Furush Beit Dajan “mentioned that the aquifer is being exhausted by Israeli wells” which supply the Hamra and Mehora settlements, Amnesty International reported. “According to Azim Mifleh, a farmer from the village, Israeli wells started pumping in the vicinity of the village in the \[1970s\] and slowly the local wells lost their efficiency.”⁠^(\[25\])

The pattern repeated, with Israeli infrastructure siphoning what once supplied the indigenous population. “In al-Auja, a village of about 5,200 people, 10 kilometres north of Jericho in the Jordan Valley, the situation is much the same,” Amnesty International reported. In 1972, Israel’s state-owned water company “sunk a well and established a pumping station, close to the Wadi Auja spring. According to residents, the spring used to provide a plentiful supply of water to the village and surrounding agricultural land via a series of irrigation channels.”⁠^(\[26\])

This state of affairs persisted for decades, continuing past the Oslo Accords.

# New Plan, Same Water Scarcity: 1993 to 2023

The Oslo Accord, signed on September 13, 1993, resulted from secret negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.⁠^(\[27\]) The agreement established an interim system for a “period not exceeding five years,” with “permanent status negotiations” set to begin by the start of the third year.⁠^(\[28\]) Oslo II, also an interim agreement, followed in September 1995.⁠^(\[29\])

Two months after the second accord, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by “an Israeli who opposed \[the accords\] on religious grounds.” Then, after the May 1996 elections, Netanyahu and his Likud Party, who “had historically opposed Palestinian statehood and withdrawal from the occupied territories,” came to power and remained in government until 1999.⁠^(\[30\]) In July 2000, U.S. President Clinton hosted Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat at Camp David “in an effort to reach an agreement on permanent status,” but no agreement was reached.⁠^(\[31\])

As a result, Oslo II has yet to be replaced, keeping Israel in control of “all water resources in the Occupied Territories.”⁠^(\[32\]) While the accord stipulated that “Israel recognizes the Palestinian water rights in the West Bank,” it listed “maintaining existing quantities of utilization from the resources,” as one of its principles.⁠^(\[33\]) It thus left Palestinians with access to only 20% of the water from the Mountain Aquifer.⁠^(\[34\]) 

Oslo II also established the Joint Water Committee (JWC), “comprised of an equal number of representatives from each side,” to handle “all water and sewage related issues in the West Bank.” It required the JWC to reach all decisions “by consensus.”⁠^(\[35\]) B’Tselem noted that Israel turned the JWC “into an instrument for promoting its own interests, after emptying the Palestinians’ veto power of meaning. It dictated that projects intended for Palestinians be discussed together with projects intended for settlements as a ‘package deal,’ thereby obliging the Palestinians to support settlement expansion.”⁠^(\[36\])

While the accords allocated “approximately 80 percent of the waters pumped from the aquifers in the West Bank” to Israel, leaving “the remaining 20 percent for Palestinian use,” even access to this share has been limited for Palestinians due to roadblocks built into the JWC’s structure. Palestinians in the region have instead been forced to pay Israel for water.⁠^(\[37\])

“Due to the non-approval of permits for the construction of Palestinian wells, the Palestinian Authority \[PA\] has not been able to extract the full amount of water as allocated by the Oslo Accords in some aquifers,” the Office of the U.N. Special Coordinator for the Middle East Process notes. “Instead, the \[PA\] is required to purchase water from the Israeli water provider, Mekerot, at a high cost.”⁠^(\[38\])

Hydrogeologist Clemens Messerschmid, who worked in the West Bank for eight years, wrote that in the decade following Oslo II, permits to drill water wells “were very difficult to obtain,” even in the aquifer system unconnected to Israel. “The licensing procedure often took years and several times Israel demanded repositioning of drilling locations. Sometimes, proposed locations were rejected with the open ‘justification’ that this location might be used in the future to drill wells for illegal Jewish settlements.”⁠^(\[39\])

A U.N. committee reported that Palestinian municipalities, such as Ramallah, “have been refused permission to drill wells unless they would also supply nearby Jewish settlements or have been forced to link up their municipal systems to the Israeli network, which gets its water supply from the ground-water of the city of Ramallah itself.”⁠^(\[40\])

When permitting rules are violated, the consequences can be swift and severe. A farmer living in the northern West Bank village of Ein al-Beida told Amnesty International that Israeli authorities cut off the village’s water supply for five days, after accusing the villagers of using more than their allotted amount. Two families living nearby also had their houses and property destroyed twice in two years, including all of their water tanks in one instance.⁠^(\[41\])

In most of the West Bank, Israel even exerts control over rainwater collection. Amnesty International reports that cisterns for collecting rainwater are also “often destroyed by the Israeli army.”⁠^(\[42\])

In 2008, the Israeli military demolished nine cisterns built with European Union funding. They were intended to irrigate about 9-11 hectares of farmland on which 3,200 trees were planted. According to a farmer who spoke to Amnesty International, “they went up and down several times with the bulldozer and uprooted everything.”⁠^(\[43\])

“Water tanks are good for target practice; they are everywhere and are the right size to aim at and calibrate your weapon, to relieve your frustration, to teach a lesson to the kids of the neighbourhood who threw stones at you and you couldn’t catch; or to break the monotony of a stint of guard duty,” an Israeli soldier told Amnesty International.⁠^(\[44\])

Meanwhile, Israel continued to over-exploit the region’s water resources, contributing to the steady deterioration of the Jordan River. By 2007, the Lower Jordan River was estimated to carry only about “2% of its natural flow.”⁠^(\[45\]) Two years later, Amnesty International reported that the Jordan’s flow through the West Bank had “been reduced to a trickle, of highly saline water heavily contaminated by untreated sewage.”⁠^(\[46\])

As for the Mountain Aquifer, “Palestinians have access to one fifth of \[its\] resources,” the World Bank reported in 2009. Palestinians draw “about 20% of the ‘estimated potential’ of the aquifers that underlie both the West Bank and Israel. Israel abstracts the balance, and in addition overdraws without \[JWC\] approval on the ‘estimated potential’ by more than 50%, up to 1.8 times its share under \[Oslo II\]. Over-extraction by deep wells combined with reduced recharge has created risks for the aquifers and a decline in water available to Palestinians through shallower wells.”⁠^(\[47\])

Even before the 2023 offensive, the situation in Gaza was dire. While Israel does not limit extraction from the Coastal Aquifer, “extraction by Israel from this aquifer in the area to the east of Gaza affects the supply available to be extracted in Gaza.”⁠^(\[48\]) Its annual sustainable yield is insufficient for Gaza’s population. “Israel does not allow the transfer of water from the Mountain Aquifer in the West Bank to Gaza,” according to Amnesty International.⁠^(\[49\]) A notable restriction, given that about a quarter of the water Israel extracts is taken from the Mountain Aquifer,⁠^(\[50\]) nearly 80% of which is replenished by rain in the West Bank.⁠^(\[51\]) This has resulted in long-term over-extraction of the Coastal Aquifer by as much as double its annual sustainable yield.⁠^(\[52\]) 

The overexploitation of this aquifer — the only water resource available to Palestinians in Gaza — led to a deterioration of the water supply. By 2009, 90 to 95% was “polluted and unfit for human consumption.”⁠^(\[53\])

Between 2008 and 2009, during ‘Operation Cast Lead,’ Israeli attacks targeted Gaza’s “water wells, water networks, waste water facilities and water tanks,” causing “an estimated \[US $6 million\] of damage.”⁠^(\[54\]) During military operations in 2014, Israel destroyed or damaged 12% of Gaza’s wells and damaged “over 33,000 metres of water and wastewater networks.” This left 450,000 people without access to municipal water as of early September, even after 80% of priority repairs had been addressed.⁠^(\[55\])

Water scarcity is a fixture of Palestinian daily life. Ethnographer Anita De Donato worked in the West Bank Dheisha refugee camp from July 2009 to January 2010. She noted that, in public events, water availability is “considered as a symbol of the honour and status of the family organizing the meeting, displayed and negotiated through the ritualized practices of hospitality and generosity, like the offering of coffee.”⁠^(\[56\]) Conditions are marked by the constant need to ration and conserve what little water is available:

>“In order to satisfy the daily needs of domestic water, the large families living in the houses in the refugee camp, which often comprise three or four generations, have to ration the water stored in the cisterns, locally called ‘water of the cisterns’ (mayya al‑khazzānāt). To have a wash, every member of my host family uses a little quantity of water, drawing it from a pail with a little bowl or a glass. During my fieldwork, I learned to wash using just three or four glasses of water. People in the house flush the toilet when there are feces, but not urine, with a bowl of dirty water, used before to wash the clothes.”⁠^(\[57\])

In contrast, Israeli settlements, declared illegal by the International Court of Justice,⁠^(\[58\]) have privileged access to water, with “lush vegetation,” well-irrigated farmlands, and even swimming pools⁠^(\[59\]) and wineries.⁠^(\[60\]) Their water supply is prioritized during the hot season, to the detriment of Palestinians.⁠^(\[61\]) Meanwhile, the number of settlers continues to rise. In 1992, the U.N. estimated that about 268,000 settlers lived in all of the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the Golan.⁠^(\[62\]) By 2024, that number had grown to around 700,000 in the West Bank and East Jerusalem alone.⁠^(\[63\])

Israel has carved out more and more Palestinian territory, taking over water-rich areas, until more than a third of all land in the West Bank was rendered “off-limits or tightly controlled to Palestinians.” These areas were then turned into settlements, military bases, nature reserves, or even firing ranges for use by the Israeli military.⁠^(\[64\])

As history shows, Israel’s ability to manufacture water scarcity did not arise overnight. It was created through decades of systematic occupation, during which Israel came to control the very means to sustain Palestinian life.

-First of all she was insanely photogenic! I know everyone has a bias towards their cats, but LaLa was just insanely beautiful in every picture I took of her. She was somehow incapable of an ugly expression 
-She was VERY petite, tiny bones and she didnt fluctuate too much from 6-7lb her whole life
-Her fur was so soft and dense she felt more like a bunny sometimes than a cat
-Was probably the most proper distinguished lady I've ever met. I adopted her at 5 1/2 so she was already her own by the time she came into my life. Every move she made was calculated and delicate. She was a clean and small eater and constantly kept her fur pile white. She didnt feel like ""my baby"" as much as my sister or best friend who knew the right time to comfort me
-Big lap cat! If she wasnt next to an open window watching outside, she was in my lap or in my arms just enjoying being carried around 
-Obsessed with grass? I had to always have some wheat grass around or else shed try to munch on my houseplants 😭 (i couldn't ever keep spiders plants alone they were her favorite) she didnt have any health issues or anything she just REALLY liked the taste of plants.
-She never once seriously bit or scratched me the whole time she was with me. Even at the end, when she was humiliated with me needing to wipe her butt and force feed her a mix of rutin and baby food, she would only give light warning bites. She never wanted to hurt me even when I may have been hurting her
-Before I adopted her, they found her in a box at a garbage dump. She was quite the helicopter mom and didnt let her kittens go until after 9 weeks 

I miss her more than words can explain. Theres an anger and deep guilt when I remember shes in a box on my coffee table now and not curled up next to me. I did everything I could but she had chylothorax and nothing we did helped her in the end. I feel bad for the new water fountain we got my roommates cat that she would have loved that she didnt experience. I feel bad when im playing with the other cats bc I didnt play with her too much in her last couple months bc of health issues. 12.5 still feels too young, im happy for the 8 years we got together but it didnt feel like enough. I took in another young mama cat to help not linger on negative emotions, shes the sweetest thing and unique in her own right. But I still break down and cry and random times bc of how much our lives revolved around eachother, and its just suddenly......not there.

The morning mist clung to the cobblestones of Saint-Germain-des-Prés like a shroud, and Athos found himself wishing he could disappear into it as easily as the fog would when the sun rose higher. He stood before the ornate doors of the Hôtel de Montclair, a mansion that had once been the jewel of the district but now seemed to brood with an almost tangible sense of tragedy.

""I still don't understand why it must be me,"" Athos said quietly, his breath forming small clouds in the chill air. Beside him, Captain de Tréville adjusted his cloak and fixed him with a steady gaze.

""Because, my friend, you are the only one among my Musketeers who possesses the necessary... qualities for this particular task."" The captain's voice carried an unusual weight. ""The Comte de Montclair was not merely a nobleman—he was one of the King's most trusted advisors in matters of finance. His death, under these circumstances, requires investigation by someone who understands both the political implications and the... darker aspects of court life.""

Athos winced slightly at the latter reference. His own past, with its shadows and secrets, was not something he discussed willingly. But de Tréville was right—if anyone could navigate the treacherous waters of aristocratic scandal, it was a man who had once swum in those very depths.

""What exactly are these circumstances?"" Athos asked, though he suspected he might not like the answer.

""The Comte was found dead in his study three days ago. The door was locked from the inside, the windows were sealed, and there was no sign of violence. The physician declared it a natural death—the man was, after all, past sixty and known to have a weak heart."" De Tréville paused, his expression growing grimmer. ""However, certain... items were found in his possession that suggest his involvement in activities that could embarrass the Crown.""

""What sort of items?""

""Love letters. Compromising ones. Written to a woman who is very much married to someone else. Someone whose loyalty to France has recently come into question.""

Athos felt a familiar chill that had nothing to do with the morning air. ""And you believe his death is connected to these letters?""

""I believe that the timing of his death, so soon after these letters were written, is too convenient to be coincidental. The Comtesse de Montclair has requested that the matter be investigated discretely, and the King has agreed. You are to determine whether the Comte died of natural causes or... other circumstances.""

The weight of the task settled on Athos's shoulders like a lead cloak. He had always been the tactician of their group, the one who saw patterns where others saw chaos, but this was different. This was not a matter of military strategy or straightforward adventure. This was the sort of investigation that required delving into the private lives of people who had every reason to keep their secrets buried.

""What of D'Artagnan and the others?"" he asked.

""They are not to be involved. This matter requires the utmost discretion, and while I trust them completely, their... enthusiasm for justice sometimes exceeds their appreciation for subtlety.""

Chapter II: The House of Secrets

The interior of the Hôtel de Montclair was as elegant as its exterior suggested, but there was something oppressive about the atmosphere that went beyond the recent tragedy. Servants moved about their duties with the sort of careful quiet that suggested they were all too aware of being watched and judged.

The Comtesse de Montclair received Athos in the main salon, a room that managed to be both magnificent and somehow suffocating. She was a woman in her fifties, still beautiful but with the kind of controlled composure that spoke of years spent managing a household, a fortune, and the complexities of court politics.

""Monsieur Athos,"" she said, rising from her chair with practiced grace. ""Captain de Tréville has told me of your... particular qualifications for this investigation. I confess I am not entirely comfortable with the necessity of such an inquiry, but I understand the implications if certain rumors are allowed to flourish unchecked.""

Athos bowed formally. ""Madame la Comtesse, I assure you that my investigation will be conducted with the utmost discretion. I have no desire to cause additional pain to your family during this difficult time.""

""I appreciate your sensitivity, monsieur. Though I must tell you that I do not believe my husband's death was anything other than natural. He had been under considerable strain recently, and his heart..."" She paused, her composure wavering slightly. ""But I understand that questions have been raised, and they must be answered.""

""If I may ask, what was the nature of this strain?""

The Comtesse's eyes grew distant. ""My husband was a man of strong convictions, Monsieur Athos. He believed deeply in the service of France and the Crown. Recently, he had become... concerned about certain influences at court. Foreign influences that he felt were undermining the King's interests.""

""And these concerns led to correspondence that might be considered... compromising?""

The Comtesse's mask of composure slipped entirely for a moment, revealing something that might have been fear. ""You have seen the letters?""

""I have been told of their existence. Perhaps you could help me understand their significance?""

She was quiet for a long moment, and when she spoke again, her voice was barely above a whisper. ""My husband was trying to gather evidence of Spanish gold being used to influence French policy. He believed that certain members of the court were being... purchased. In his investigation, he found it necessary to cultivate relationships with people who might have access to such information.""

""Including the lady in question?""

""Including her, yes. But I can assure you, monsieur, that whatever those letters might suggest, my husband's interest in Madame de Chevreuse was purely professional. He was using her connections to gather intelligence for the Crown.""

Athos nodded, though he made no comment on the likelihood of such a claim. Madame de Chevreuse was known throughout Paris as a woman of considerable beauty and even greater ambition, whose loyalty to France was indeed questionable. If the Comte had been corresponding with her, the implications were serious regardless of his motives.

""I will need to examine his study,"" Athos said. ""And I will need to speak with the servants who found him.""

""Of course. But please, Monsieur Athos, remember that this house is still in mourning. Whatever you may discover, I beg you to handle it with care.""

Chapter III: The Locked Room

The Comte's study was a testament to a life spent in service to scholarship and statecraft. The walls were lined with books in multiple languages, and the massive oak desk was covered with papers that spoke of a man who had remained active in his pursuits right up until his death.

Athos examined the room systematically, noting details that might have escaped a less experienced eye. The door had indeed been locked from the inside, with the key still in the lock. The windows were not only sealed but showed no signs of tampering. By all appearances, the Comte had simply collapsed at his desk and died alone.

But something felt wrong.

""Tell me about the morning you found him,"" Athos said to Henri, the valet who had discovered the body.

The man was clearly nervous, wringing his hands as he spoke. ""I brought his morning coffee at seven, as was my custom. When he didn't answer my knock, I became concerned. The master was always awake by six, you see, working at his correspondence. When I tried the door, it was locked.""

""And then?""

""I called for help. The footmen and I, we forced the door. We found him slumped over his desk, still in his clothes from the previous evening. The physician said his heart had simply... stopped.""

Athos walked to the desk and examined the papers scattered across its surface. Most were routine correspondence, but one item caught his attention—a half-finished letter that began ""My dearest Marie-Aimée..."" and broke off mid-sentence.

""Henri, when your master wrote letters of a personal nature, was it his custom to use his formal stationery?""

The valet looked puzzled. ""No, monsieur. For personal correspondence, he used his private paper, with the family seal. The formal stationery was reserved for official business.""

Athos examined the unfinished letter more closely. It was written on the Comte's official stationery, but the handwriting seemed somehow different from the other documents on the desk. More hurried, perhaps, or written under stress.

""Who else had access to this room?""

""Only myself and the Comtesse, monsieur. The master was very particular about his privacy when working.""

""And the evening before his death—did you see him retire to his study?""

Henri hesitated. ""Yes, monsieur. But... there was something unusual. He asked me to bring him a glass of brandy, which was not typical. He usually preferred wine with his dinner. And he seemed... agitated.""

""Agitated how?""

""He kept looking toward the window, as if he expected someone. And he asked me to ensure that all the doors were locked before I retired.""

Athos filed this information away and continued his examination. On the floor beside the desk, partially hidden beneath a fallen book, he found something that made his blood run cold—a small glass vial, empty but still carrying the faint smell of bitter almonds.

Chapter IV: The Art of Deduction

That evening, Athos sat in his modest lodgings, a bottle of wine at his elbow and the pieces of the puzzle spread before him like a battle plan. Despite his reluctance to take on this investigation, he found himself drawn into the intellectual challenge of solving the mystery.

The facts, as he understood them, were these: The Comte de Montclair had been found dead in his locked study, apparently of natural causes. But he had been corresponding with a woman of questionable loyalty, he had been investigating Spanish influence at court, and on the night of his death, he had been nervous and had requested his doors be locked.

The unfinished letter troubled him. If the Comte had been writing to his supposed paramour when he died, why was the letter on his official stationery? And why did the handwriting seem different from his other correspondence?

Then there was the vial. Bitter almonds meant only one thing—cyanide. But how had it been administered to a man locked alone in his study?

Athos poured himself another glass of wine and allowed his mind to work through the possibilities. The Comte had been investigating Spanish influence, which meant he had enemies. But his death had been made to look natural, which suggested sophistication. The killer had wanted to avoid the investigation that would inevitably follow an obvious murder.

But they had made mistakes. The vial, for one—a professional would have removed it. The unfinished letter, for another—it was too convenient, too obviously designed to support the theory of a man dying while writing to his lover.

The more he thought about it, the more convinced he became that the Comte's death was indeed murder. But proving it would require more than deduction—it would require exposing secrets that powerful people wanted to keep buried.

Chapter V: The Dangerous Lady

The next morning found Athos in the fashionable district of the Marais, standing outside the elegant town house of Marie-Aimée de Chevreuse. The lady in question was known to hold court in the afternoons, receiving visitors who came to enjoy her wit, her beauty, and her connections to the highest levels of society.

She received him in a salon that was a masterpiece of expensive restraint, every detail calculated to impress without appearing ostentatious. Madame de Chevreuse herself was everything her reputation suggested—beautiful, intelligent, and possessed of the kind of magnetic presence that made men forget their better judgment.

""Monsieur Athos,"" she said, offering him her hand with a smile that was both welcoming and calculating. ""I confess myself surprised by your visit. I was not aware that Musketeers made social calls.""

""This is not a social call, madame. I am investigating the death of the Comte de Montclair.""

Her expression didn't change, but Athos caught a flicker of something in her eyes—fear, perhaps, or anger. ""The poor Comte. Such a tragedy. I understand his heart simply gave out.""

""So it appears. But there are certain... complications that require clarification.""

""Such as?""

""Such as the letters he wrote to you. Letters that might be interpreted as compromising to both your reputation and his loyalty to France.""

Now she did react, her composure slipping slightly. ""I think you have been misinformed, monsieur. While I was acquainted with the Comte, our relationship was entirely proper.""

""Then you won't mind if I ask you about the nature of your acquaintance?""

She was quiet for a moment, clearly weighing her options. When she spoke, her voice was carefully controlled. ""The Comte approached me several months ago. He had heard... rumors about certain activities at court. Activities that might be harmful to French interests. He asked for my assistance in investigating these rumors.""

""And you agreed?""

""I am a loyal subject of France, monsieur. If there were foreign agents attempting to influence our government, I felt it my duty to help expose them.""

""Even if it meant corresponding with the Comte in terms that might be misunderstood?""

Her laugh was bitter. ""You think I cared about gossip? Monsieur, I have been the subject of court scandal for so long that I am quite immune to it. But the Comte... he was more concerned about appearances. He insisted that our communications be conducted in a manner that would not draw attention from those we were investigating.""

""So the passionate language in his letters was... professional?""

""It was necessary camouflage. Anyone intercepting our correspondence would assume it was merely another court intrigue, not an investigation into treason.""

Athos studied her carefully. She was either telling the truth or was a more accomplished actress than he had given her credit for. ""And what did this investigation reveal?""

""That the Comte's suspicions were well-founded. There is indeed Spanish gold flowing to certain members of the court. Money intended to influence French policy in ways that would benefit Spanish interests.""

""Can you prove this?""

She hesitated. ""The Comte could have proven it. He had gathered evidence—documents, testimonies, financial records. But with his death...""

""Where is this evidence now?""

""I don't know. He was supposed to meet with me the night he died to show me what he had discovered. When he didn't appear, I assumed he had postponed our meeting. I didn't learn of his death until the following day.""

Chapter VI: The Missing Papers

Armed with this new information, Athos returned to the Hôtel de Montclair with a clearer sense of what he was looking for. If the Comte had indeed gathered evidence of Spanish treachery, and if that evidence had disappeared with his death, then the motive for murder became crystal clear.

The Comtesse received him in her private sitting room, a smaller, more intimate space that seemed to reflect her personality more than the formal salon where they had first met.

""Monsieur Athos, I hope your investigation is progressing satisfactorily?""

""It is, madame, though I find myself in need of your assistance. Did your husband keep any papers in a location other than his study? Perhaps a safe, or a private cabinet?""

She looked puzzled. ""Why do you ask?""

""I have reason to believe that your husband was gathering evidence of treasonous activities at court. Evidence that may have disappeared after his death.""

Her reaction was immediate and visceral. ""Treasonous activities? What are you suggesting?""

""I'm suggesting that your husband may have been murdered to prevent him from exposing Spanish agents in the French court.""

She stared at him for a long moment, then rose and walked to a portrait of her late husband that hung above the fireplace. ""He kept a private safe,"" she said quietly. ""Behind this painting. But the key... the key was always on his person.""

""May I examine it?""

She nodded, and together they moved the portrait aside to reveal a small but sophisticated safe built into the wall. The lock was intact, showing no signs of tampering.

""The key was with his body when he was found?""

""Yes. The physician gave it to me with his other personal effects.""

She produced a small silver key, and Athos opened the safe. Inside, he found exactly what he had expected—nothing. The safe was completely empty, despite the fact that it showed signs of recent use.

""This safe was not empty when your husband died,"" he said with certainty.

""How can you be sure?""

""Because a man doesn't maintain a safe to keep nothing in it. And because the interior shows scratches consistent with papers being stored and removed regularly."" He paused, studying the empty compartment. ""Madame, I believe your husband was murdered, and I believe the killer took whatever evidence he had gathered about Spanish treachery.""

The Comtesse sank into a chair, her face pale. ""But the door was locked from the inside. How could someone have murdered him and then escaped?""

""That,"" Athos said grimly, ""is what I intend to find out.""

Chapter VII: The Servant's Secret

The breakthrough came from an unexpected source. Athos had been questioning the household staff individually, looking for inconsistencies in their stories, when he noticed something odd about Henri, the valet. The man was nervous, certainly, but there was something else—guilt, perhaps, or fear of discovery.

""Henri,"" Athos said, cornering the man in the servants' hall, ""I need you to tell me the truth about the night your master died.""

""I have told you the truth, monsieur. I found him dead in his study the next morning.""

""But you didn't tell me about your visit to his study that evening.""

Henri's face went white. ""I... I don't know what you mean.""

""I think you do. You brought him his evening brandy, as you said. But you also brought him something else, didn't you? Something that someone paid you to deliver.""

The valet's composure cracked entirely. ""Please, monsieur, I didn't know what it was. I thought it was medicine. The gentleman said the master had requested it, that it was for his heart condition.""

""What gentleman?""

""I don't know his name. He approached me in the market two days before. Said he was a physician, that he had been treating the master in secret because the master was embarrassed about his condition. He gave me a small vial and told me to put it in the master's brandy that evening.""

""And you believed this story?""

Henri's voice was barely a whisper. ""He paid me more than I earn in a year, monsieur. My daughter, she needs medicine, expensive medicine, and I... I thought it would do no harm.""

""Describe this man.""

""Tall, well-dressed, with dark hair and a small scar on his left cheek. He spoke with a slight accent, though I couldn't place it.""

""Spanish?""

""Perhaps. Yes, that could be it.""

Athos felt the pieces of the puzzle clicking into place. ""And after you gave your master the doctored brandy, what happened?""

""I retired to my quarters, as usual. But later, perhaps two hours later, I heard voices from the master's study. I thought perhaps he had received a visitor, though I hadn't heard anyone arrive.""

""Voices? More than one?""

""Yes, monsieur. The master's voice, and another. They seemed to be arguing.""

""And then?""

""Then nothing. Silence. I assumed the visitor had left.""

""But you didn't check?""

Henri shook his head miserably. ""I was afraid, monsieur. Afraid of what I had done. I spent the night praying that the master would be well, that the medicine would help him. When I found him dead the next morning, I... I knew it was my fault.""

Chapter VIII: The Locked Room Revealed

With Henri's confession, the mystery of the locked room began to unravel. Athos spent the rest of the day examining the Comte's study with new eyes, looking for evidence of how the killer had managed to escape from a room that was locked from the inside.

The solution, when he found it, was both ingenious and simple. The study had a large fireplace, and the chimney, while too narrow for a man to climb, was wide enough for someone to reach down from above. More importantly, the chimney connected to a network of flues that served the entire house.

By examining the roof, Athos discovered that the chimney had been recently cleaned—but not by the household staff. Soot and debris had been carefully removed, and scratches in the masonry suggested that someone had used the chimney as an escape route.

The killer had entered through the front door, probably claiming to be a physician responding to the Comte's sudden illness. The doctored brandy had weakened the Comte but not killed him immediately, giving the assassin time to extract the evidence from the safe. When the Comte realized what was happening, he had tried to fight back, but the poison had already done its work.

The killer had then locked the door from the inside, climbed up the chimney to the roof, and escaped into the night. By the time Henri had discovered the body the next morning, the assassin was long gone, and the evidence of Spanish treachery had disappeared with him.

Chapter IX: The Reckoning

Athos presented his findings to Captain de Tréville in the same office where he had reluctantly accepted the investigation. The captain listened with the expression of a man who had suspected the truth but hoped to be wrong.

""So the Comte was indeed murdered,"" de Tréville said when Athos had finished his report. ""And the evidence he had gathered about Spanish infiltration is gone.""

""Yes, sir. But the investigation itself has revealed the existence of this network. With Henri's description of the assassin and our knowledge of their methods, we can begin to identify and eliminate Spanish agents operating in France.""

""And the valet?""

""He was a tool, nothing more. A man desperate to help his sick child, manipulated by professionals who knew exactly how to exploit his weakness. I recommend clemency.""

De Tréville nodded. ""The King will be... displeased about the security breach, but grateful for the intelligence. This investigation has served its purpose, even if it cost the life of a patriot.""

""There is one more thing, sir. The Comtesse de Montclair should be warned. If the Spanish agents believe she might have knowledge of her husband's investigation, she could be in danger.""

""I'll arrange for her protection."" The captain paused, then added, ""You've done excellent work, Athos. This investigation required exactly the kind of analytical mind and discretion that you possess. I may call upon you for similar tasks in the future.""

Athos felt a familiar chill. ""Sir, I hope such tasks will not be necessary.""

""So do I, my friend. So do I.""

Chapter X: The Price of Knowledge

That evening, Athos met with his three friends at their usual tavern. D'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis had respected his request for secrecy during the investigation, but their curiosity was evident.

""You look like a man who has seen too much,"" Aramis observed, studying Athos's face with his characteristic perceptiveness.

""I have solved a murder,"" Athos replied, then took a long drink of wine. ""But in doing so, I have learned things that I wish I could unknow.""

""Such as?"" D'Artagnan asked.

""Such as how easy it is to corrupt good men when their children are sick. Such as how sophisticated our enemies have become in their methods. Such as how many secrets the nobility keep, and how easily those secrets can be exploited.""

Porthos leaned forward. ""Did you find your killer?""

""I found the method and the motive. The killer himself has almost certainly fled France by now, but the network he represented is still active. Still dangerous.""

""And the Comte? Was he truly the patriot he appeared to be?""

Athos nodded. ""He was. A man who died trying to protect France from foreign influence. But he made the mistake of investigating enemies who were more ruthless than he anticipated.""

Aramis raised his glass. ""To the Comte de Montclair, then. A man who served his country even unto death.""

They drank in silence, each lost in his own thoughts. Finally, D'Artagnan spoke. ""Will you take on more such investigations?""

""I hope not,"" Athos replied. ""But I fear that Captain de Tréville may have other uses for my... particular talents.""

""Then we'll be ready to assist you,"" Porthos declared. ""All for one, and one for all.""

""Even in this darker sort of adventure?"" Athos asked.

""Especially in this darker sort of adventure,"" D'Artagnan said firmly. ""France has many enemies, and they use many methods. If some of those methods require detective work rather than swordplay, then we'll learn to be detectives.""

Athos smiled for the first time in days. ""I pray it won't come to that. But if it does, I can think of no better companions for such work.""

Epilogue: The Shadow Service

Three months later, a small notice appeared in the court records, noting the establishment of a new branch of the King's service, responsible for investigating matters of security and intelligence. The notice was brief and gave no details about the personnel or methods of this new organization.

Those who knew how to read between the lines understood that France was adapting to a new kind of warfare, one fought with information and deception rather than swords and cannons. The age of the gentleman spy had begun.

Athos, now bearing the unofficial title of Chief Investigator, maintained his quarters with the Musketeers but spent increasing amounts of time on cases that required his unique combination of analytical skill, aristocratic connections, and hard-won understanding of human nature.

He never learned to enjoy the work, but he came to understand its necessity. In a world where enemies wore friendly faces and death could come from a trusted servant carrying doctored brandy, France needed men who could see through the deceptions and identify the threats hidden in plain sight.

The Comte de Montclair was avenged, not through the dramatic satisfaction of a sword fight, but through the quiet, methodical work of building a network capable of protecting France from those who would destroy it from within.

And in the shadows of Saint-Germain, where the morning mist still clung to the cobblestones, the game of espionage and counter-espionage continued, with Athos and his friends as its reluctant but dedicated players.

THE END 

*Author's Note: This sequel continues the adventures of the Four Musketeers, focusing on Athos's reluctant transformation into a detective. While maintaining the spirit and style of the original Dumas characters, it explores themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and the changing nature of warfare in 17th-century France.

I know questions like this have come up over the years, but I wanted to reach out to the Santa Rosa community for any fresh perspectives or updated experiences.

My husband and I currently rent in Silicon Valley, but we would like to move to buy a home and start a family. At first we were looking at Folsom for its affordability, proximity to the outdoors, and great schools, but we recently started considering Santa Rosa.

Our budget is up to $750k, ideally for a home with at least 3 bds and a backyard for our two large dogs. We’re in our thirties, and our interests/hobbies include things like fishing, camping, hiking with our dogs, craft beer, coffee shops, and (gluten-free) bakeries. We’re also a Black and Asian couple, so growing diversity is important to us, but what we really value is a strong sense of community.

If you've moved to Santa Rosa recently (or even years ago), how has your experience been?

Are you happy with your decision?

How would you describe quality of life now — and do you feel optimistic about the next 5–10 years?

Have you noticed any meaningful changes (positive or negative) in the city lately?

And a long shot — if anyone has lived in both Folsom and Santa Rosa, how do they compare for you?

Somewhere in downtown DC? I’m flexible on location otherwise :)” - is it acceptable to ask her where she is in DC so I can pick a spot?

This is an update but here’s some context again: I (23M) met a woman (38F) at a networking event a few weeks ago. I found her attractive, got her number, and after a week of texting, I invited her for coffee, saying I’d really like to get to know her better.

She said yes but was about to leave for a 3-week trip and told me we could meet the next day for a quick coffee if I was free (I wasn’t in town). While she was traveling, we talked every few days and she’d reply with how her trip was going.

She just got back two days ago, and we talked about 4th July plans. I told her to let me know if she’s looking for something to do and that it’d be fun to celebrate with her. She responded: “Yes that sounds fun! Let me figure out what’s happening tomorrow when I’m back and I can let you know when I’m free 😊”

This morning, she texted saying she’s free tomorrow evening or on the weekend and asked about my plans. I said I’m free all weekend and that my only plans are seeing her tomorrow night. I gave her two options: fireworks or quiet dinner downtown.

A few hours later, she replied: “Ah so sorry can we meet at the weekend? A coffee one afternoon on Saturday or Sunday? I think I’ve overpacked my day tomorrow and quite jet lagged so my bedtime is early for the next couple of days 🙃”

I’m kind of deflated, I had no other plans, and I was genuinely looking forward to it. More importantly: Was this just bad timing, or is this her way of gently letting me down? 

I told her that I understand and that Saturday works for coffee and she just told that works. Is it okay for me to ask where she lives so I can find a place for us? How do I ask this in a normal manner?

1lrqlgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lrqlgj/aita_for_mentioning_a_marriage_proposal_about_an/,AITA for mentioning a marriage proposal about an old classmate to an ex-friend?,"So, this has been a few years since this happened and I'm still very confused about this whole situation.

I knew Chole (fake name) for about a half a year. One day, we went to a coffee shop, and I got my hot cocoa first and sat a table while waiting for Chole to get her green tea and I went on Instagram and see my classmate 'Brock' got engaged to his girlfriend of 5 years 'Penny' in Italy.

Info: Chole and Brock worked at the same YMCA for a couple years according to her, but a few weeks earlier Chole said she didn't know Brock. So why is it you two are standing next to each other smiling in a picture at a YMCA picnic about a month ago because Chloe says she doesn't know Brock?

Anyway, I say to Chole, ""Hey an old classmate of mine got engaged to his girlfriend of 5 years. Wanna see the ring?""

Natural as a girl, Chole says yes.

I show Chole the picture it was a little blurry, but you could see the girl in the picture had a huge diamond on her hand. Chole did something odd though, she literally zooms out of the ring and on to Brock's face. Chole puts my phone on the table, slides it back to me and leaves the coffee shop with her green tea, purse, phone and keys.

Chole doesn't come back so I grab an Uber to get back home because Chole was my ride.

I tell my parents about what happened, and they think it's weird but who knows Chole could be going through some stuff. Understandable.

I try calling Chole and it goes straight to voicemail until the fifth time I call. Chole's mom answers. This is the convo:

Me: Chole? 

Chole's mom: Op, this is Chole's mom.

Me: Oh, hi. Is Chole there?

Chole's mom: Yes, but Chole is too upset about her boyfriend got engaged to his side chick. (Umm, I'm think side chick don't you mean girlfriend).

Me: You mean Travis (fake name and Chole's actual boyfriend)?

Chole's mom: No, Travis isn't her boyfriend... Brock is.

Me: Umm...okay. Can you tell her to call me back?

Chole's mom: Yes, I will. Goodbye.

Me: Bye.

We hang up.

Chole didn't call me or text me for a month and a half then she starts texting me like normal.

One other thing, Chole said she didn't have Snapchat, then why did I find her on Snapchat. (This is important.)

Next time, I saw Chole was at restaurant for lunch and I brought the Snapchat thing to Chole after we order and drinking milkshakes. This is when stuff hits the fan.

Chole starts screaming and yelling at me for bringing it up. She then stands up, grabs her stuff and pacing outside the restaurant talking to someone on the phone for like ten minutes then comes in all happy and calm. I don't bring it up again during lunch, but I try asking about Brock. Chole does the same thing.

After lunch, we're driving back to my house. Chole pulls over in my neighbor's shop's parking lot and tells me to get out and I can walk home. (It was like a 10-minute walk, but it was pouring rain.)

I give her a confused look, and she starts shouting at me to get out of the car. So, I do, and Chole speeds off. Thanks god, my neighbor was at his shop and he drove me home.

Chole stops messaging me after that.

So, this next part, I find out Chole and Brock are friends on Facebook and both of the relationship status both stay single, but after Brock and Penny get married, both Chole and Brock delete their relationship status after that.

I blocked Chole and Brock after that.

But am I the a-hole from even bringing up my old classmate's engagement to an ex-friend because she started acting crazy after I did?

1lrqk8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/1lrqk8c/i_feel_like_the_sacrifices_ive_had_to_make_to_be/,I feel like the sacrifices I’ve had to make to be with my girlfriend doesn’t justify being with her,"We’ve been together for 2 years, off for about 3 months. To be with this girl, I’ve had to make many friend sacrifices. She isn’t wrong for her feelings but I feel like she doesn’t give me enough to justify those. Essentially I had to cut off a handful of friends to be with her. One group I was close with, long story short one of them accused my girlfriend of doing something she misunderstood about and cut her off from that friend group, and she lost all her friends. Messed up for sure but I couldn’t stay loyal to her and continue hanging out with them (by the way same friends that introduced me to my gf). 

Next there’s a group of girls I’m friends with that she tried being friends with, for whatever reason that didn’t work out and they stopped responding to her. She had her feelings hurt about it, so I don’t hang out with them anymore either. 

 Next, one of my closest girl friends is best friends with a girl I have history with. While we were not dating in those 3 months I did hook up with the girl, she found out and was hurt by it (I wasn’t exactly truthful about it admittedly), but because of that she doesn’t want me to hang out with the other girl. 

My girlfriend goes on vacation all the time with her family they’re quite wealthy. Now it’s not like I expect an invite or anything, but I know guys she’s just been “friends with” that have gone on a trip or 2 with her. Her parents aren’t too fond of me because of those 3 months we weren’t together, she was pretty depressed the whole time and her parents saw her like that. Therefore I don’t get any invites to anything. 

I do a lot for this girl. I buy her gifts randomly to make her day, pick flowers I see for her all the time, cook for her, spend so much of my time with her. Text her every night before I go to bed, sometimes just shoot a random Venmo to get her coffee. she has a social life because of my friends. However I feel like I don’t get anything in return. She’s had to make no sacrifices with people to be with me. She’s very sweet and loving, but I bring a lot of benefit to her life and I feel like she doesn’t to me. I don’t expect to be included in what she does with her family but I’ve sacrificed a lot of trips and events I could be doing with these people. 

For example, today’s the 4th. She’s off with her family in Cancun. They have a house that they own. They flew there on their private jet. I’m in town here, one of my roommates is hanging out with one group while the other is with the other (none of them with the girl I have history with). The rest of my friends are ALL out of town with their girlfriends and their girlfriend’s family, however I don’t have that luxury. So I’m stuck doing nothing. I wanted to visit my close friend that lives in FL but she wouldn’t be happy about that either (by the way I’m close with that family as well. It’s not like I’d stay with just me and her, it would be at their family’s house. Have stayed at their place a few times before with them as well). It’s making me reevaluate what benefit she brings in my life. Yes she’s sweet and loving, takes care of me etc. but there are 0 perks to being with her. It’s not like she spoils me either. On my end, there are so many perks to being with me. 

Am I being unfair? She’s sweet, she cooks for me, does mostly what I ask her to do, but I feel like there are no perks to being with her and it doesn’t amount to the sacrifices I’ve made to be with her. ",5,1751655539.0,makemychoice,5,0.78,False

I recently started a new job, with Monday set to be my 90 day mark. It’s been chaotic so far (bullets below as to why). Yesterday morning, I received a meeting request from one of my colleagues - the head of employee comms, not our HR rep - for a 1:1 30-minute “catch up” at 9:30 AM this Monday. The description of the meeting said “let’s do an informal coffee chat ☺️” 

- The line manager for the role was switched right before they sent the offer. 
- During my first week, I was flown out to Spain for an all team retreat, during which it was announced that the company was undergoing budget cuts. 
- More recently, the company announced travel and hiring freezes. 
- I repeatedly reached out to my line manager over my first two months with proposals for long-term goals that I wanted to implement, and didn’t receive any feedback as to whether or not these were approved. 
- One month ago, my line manager unexpectedly went on medical leave for a cancer diagnosis, and I was not assigned another supervisor. 
- It is an international team and, apart from one other person, I am the only individual in my function that is located in my country. 

I’ve been doing what I can to build relationships, learn processes, and assist with “ad hoc” projects, but it’s been stressful, to say the least. This past week, I had a death in the family, and had to travel home on Tuesday and Wednesday. I was extremely close to this family member, and am still feeling raw about it - it would suck to receive such negative news right after that. 

There is a good chance that she just wants to catch up, and I think that it would be especially evil to include that description for a layoff meeting, but I am feeling especially paranoid about it given the warning signs from the company.

One trick that helped instead of a traditional L-shaped sectional, I went modular with smaller pieces that I could rearrange based on traffic flow. Being able to shift components instead of committing to one shape gave me way more flexibility (and made cleaning way easier). I also swapped a bulky coffee table for a lift top version that doubles as a workspace total game changer.

While researching furniture that ships fast and doesn’t need a toolbox to assemble, I came across [Aliving Home](http://alivinghome.com). Their stuff is designed to be modular, tool free, and ships super fast in the U.S.  I ended up going with a recliner from them that fits flush to the wall (zero wall recliner?).

I could not get 18g of the ground beans into the tamper. I think I lost 3g. Obviously when I poured the shot, the puck was too wet - although I did get approx. 36g in just under 30 seconds.

There is not a lot of information about brewing dark roasts so I am hoping for a bit of guidance on what I can expect.

Should I be aiming for less that 18g for a double shot? I feel like the grind level was close to being okay there just wasn't enough coffee in the basket. How do I compensate for the dark roast?

Well I'm 4 months in...,"It feels like yesterday I stared at myself in horror in the mirror, gut starting to hang and a spare tyre round my middle, but the worst was the jowls and double chin starting to form. I'd always considered myself ""slim"", or at least ""not fat, of course not"", but there was no hiding it now. 

I had a crash course in intermittent fasting, started the very next day. It's now exactly 4 months on, and for anyone just starting IF and feeling daunted...lemme tell ya...that's the fastest 4 months of my life. Start of spring.... it's now not even mid summer...

It's flown by, feels like no time at all, but I'm 30lb down, spare tyre is gone, neck has tightened up (don't need to remember 
to mew).

I started 16:8 but turns out I didn't even need a window that big. Ended up at 19:5 naturally.

I just skip breakfast and lunch. That's it. So simple.

One big fuck-off meal a day. Meat, a good helping of it too, and a mountain of salad, seriously...go big on all raw veg. Couple eggs in there too.

Snack on fruit, as much as you want afterwards in your window, and maybe a bit of granola with yoghurt.. and that's it.

After filling up on protein and a mound of leafy crunchy veg, I'm not really hungry anymore anyway.

Saving myself a shitload of money too, not buying expensive, processed shite, or snacks. 

Lose weight AND have more money?...I mean, come on here... this is too good to be true. 

Here's the part where I tell you that this hasn't been easy... it's been a tough, serious, solid commitment that requires.... lol who am I kidding, it's been a fucking breeze.

Seriously, this hasn't been strenuous at all. Yeah, those first few weeks can be 'distracting' (you're missing junk food, you're weaker at the end of the day, you have hard hunger pangs), but it's really manageable. 

And you can still have a ""cheat"" day. Once a week I'll have ""junk"" dinner...a pizza, or kebab, whatever... and can have some chocolate or other normal snacks. 

And after a few weeks, once you start to notice that you have a ton of energy, enough to do a 4 mile walk even though you haven't eaten all day and it's 4pm... that's when it clicks that the way we've been looking at food all our lives... fucking breakfast, lunch and dinner? And snacks too?...is insane. 

Ok... so although this has been easy - trust me, it has, I'm a naturally lazy person - there are a couple of caveats, a few asterisks to take care of. 

I'm not going to say ""downsides"", because that would imply difficultly, and this process hasn't been difficult.

List of asterisks: 

1. You'll often think about food. You'll dream about it, and what you can have on your ""cheat day"". But this passes fast, month or 2 at most, and a bonus is that all food, even ""boring"" salad and protein, tastes like gourmet fine dining.

2. Your breath. Seriously, your breath will reek. Ratchet up your dental hygiene routine, use more mouthwash, and carry a little breath spray with you. You'll need it. If you drink black coffee all day outside your eating window, like I do, then it's even worse.

3. Not being able to notice the results properly at first. You'll not see it for while, even though - in my case - my 
trousers were all starting to sag off me by the second month, and I've literally had to make 2 more notches in my favourite belt just to keep my trousers on. Other people will notice, but you won't for a bit longer. So don't give up thinking that it's not working. Base your success on scale weight, not the mirror.

And that's it folks... and of asterisks, and end of update. I'm not even going to start on the other benefits... mental clarity, reduction in anxiety etc... because I'm still a beginner myself, and want to know these extra benefits aren't just because I'm in a better mood. 

So anyone just starting... or in that second or third week when you might be feeling ""meh"" and just wanting to binge... stick at it. 

See how you feel in November. Trust me",16,1751655152.0,intermittentfasting,5,1.0,False

As someone who relies heavily on coffee to face the day, I had high hopes for the BUNN BTX-B Speed Brew. After using it daily for the past few weeks, I feel like I’ve experienced its highs, lows, and quirks. Sleek in its black stainless steel design, this machine strikes a balance between sophistication and functionality that caught my eye immediately. Its compact dimensions (2""x9.25""x14.25"") made it an easy fit on the counter, even in my already-crowded kitchen.  

The design also boasts a double-walled thermal carafe, which stood out right away. The thermal insulation keeps coffee piping hot for hours without a heated plate, reducing the risk of bitterness. I took a single serving to sip on a Zoom meeting, and even after an hour, the temperature held steady. It's much better than the lukewarm brews I’ve had with glass carafes in the past.  

**Brewing Performance and Customization Options**  

Brew speed is no joke here. This coffee maker can churn out a full carafe in just four minutes. On mornings when I’m running late, this feature has been a lifesaver. The internal stainless steel hot water reservoir keeps water ready at all times, ensuring rapid brewing at the flip of the lid. And if I’m only craving a single cup, it can brew 20oz in about two minutes—great for filling my travel mug on the go.  

The spray head technology intrigued me, adding to that café feel. Water is evenly distributed over the coffee grounds, enhancing flavor extraction. I tested this with several blends, and it genuinely brought out more nuanced flavors compared to standard drip machines. However, I wish there were more settings to play around with. This is a “set it and forget it” type of machine with fewer options for customization, which might leave enthusiasts wanting more control.  

**[Check BUNN BTX-B price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b000ffryyk/)**  

**Good Points**:  

- Lightning-fast brewing time for both travel mugs and full carafes.  
- Commercial-grade spray head enhances flavor extraction for café-style coffee.  
- Thermal carafe design keeps coffee hot for over two hours without a heating plate.  
- The taller funnel accommodates precise paper filters, allowing the water to flow rapidly without overflowing grounds.  
- Compact and thoughtfully designed for both aesthetics and space efficiency.  

**Drawbacks**:  

- A lack of adjustment options for brew strength or water temperature.  
- No hot plate for those who occasionally prefer visual confirmation of their coffee warmth.  
- Not the quietest coffee maker—I noticed it emits a moderate noise during brewing.  

**Rival Brands in the Coffee Maker Market**  

When comparing this product to competitors, like Cuisinart’s thermal carafes or the Technivorm Moccamaster, a few distinctions come to light. The BUNN model excels in brew speed and keeps things highly streamlined, which works in its favor for everyday use. Its durability also seems superior to similar models. Cuisinart offers more programmable settings but lacks the lightning-fast brewing time found here. Meanwhile, the Technivorm edges ahead in terms of premium build materials and a distinct aesthetic but comes at a steeper price.  

Where BUNN stumbles slightly is the limited flexibility in brewing options and potential retail cost comparison. If you’re looking for a coffee maker to adjust brew strength or handle smaller quantities than 20oz, some competitors might better address those needs.  

**Cost Efficiency**  

Price-to-performance plays a big role for anyone shopping for their home coffee maker. While this model may feel steep for someone upgrading from a basic drip machine, it’s worth every penny for coffee drinkers who prioritize quick brewing and consistent flavor. Savings also rack up over time because the thermal carafe eliminates the need for disposable warmers or constant reheating.  

Here's a little bonus: the machine comes with a 3-year warranty and a U.S.-based customer service team, which adds peace of mind for purchases in terms of reliability over the long term.

I take pride in manually copying data from one place to another, cell by painstaking cell, like our ancestors did. But now I’ve got this overzealous coworker — let’s call him “Mr. Efficiency” — who keeps trying to “help” me with his dangerous ideas like automation and report exports.

Like, bro, I’ve been opening Remedy tickets, reading them line-by-line, and retyping each field into Excel since before you could even spell “PowerQuery.” It builds character. It’s practically a rite of passage. But nooooo — now I’m being told there’s some kind of search function in Remedy? That you can export tickets directly to Excel? What next? Flying cars? AI that writes sarcastic Reddit posts?

AND THEN — get this — he comes for the SharePoint calendar.

The SharePoint. Calendar.
My sacred domain of manually transcribing every meeting, one date at a time, into yet another spreadsheet. Does he appreciate the quiet zen of Ctrl+C/V? No. He just points at this “Export to Excel” button like it’s some kind of cheat code. What am I, some kind of script kiddie?

He showed it to me like five times, and every time I looked him dead in the eye and said “We’ve always done it this way.” Because real sysadmins don’t bend to progress. We stare innovation in the face and say, “Nah, I got a routine.”

The worst part? This whole “automation” garbage is saving me time. Like, hours per week. And I hate it. I used to spend that time sipping cold coffee, pretending to read ticket details while tabbing between Remedy and Excel like a goddamn artist. Now I click a button and poof, data’s all there. What am I supposed to do with myself now? Work??

Anyway, if you need me, I’ll be busy manually typing meeting times from Outlook into Excel, because integrity.

ETA: Back in my day, we didn’t have “export” buttons. We had clipboards, not clipboards managers. You think I got into IT to let a machine do my job for me? Hell no — I earned my carpal tunnel the honest way, one manual entry at a time.",34,1751654972.0,ShittySysadmin,20,0.9,False
1lrqc6w,https://i.redd.it/xvzsrpgilwaf1.jpeg,An Update for the Cake Eating Bitches,"

Thank you to all that recommended such wonderful bakeries to sit my ass down and eat some cake. 

I started my day off at Yasukochi’s Sweet shop for the coffee crunch cake. (center right) We walked over to the Japantown center and sat inside by Jina Bakes. I wanted to only go to bakeries I’ve never been so I didn’t get anything from Jina Bakes but I highly recommend going. God damn that cake was good, so light and fluffy. 

From there we headed out to Schuberts and even though google said they were open, sadly a sign on the door said they were not so we mowed down on the curry beef buns from a shop nearby and walked clement for a bit before we decided to head back toward downtown to Hayes Valley to Loquat. 

The chocolate slice ( bottom left) from Loquat, fuuuuuuck, such a delicate yet rich cake. With a nice cup of black tea I had to sit there and contemplate life for a bit before we felt like we needed to get our asses up and walk more so off to Craftman and Wolves in the mission. 

A nice stroll to the mission where it felt like the sun was trying to break through to shine a bit of warmth upon our sugar filled bodies we found ourselves inside staring at the desserts at Craftman and Wolves. We decided on two from here because it would have been a disservice to all cake eating bitches to only have one. I can’t even recall what was in these two (right top and bottom) but all I gotta say is these pieces of edible art were glorious and I will be back to this place again. 

From here we needed to give our bellies a break so we headed to my local elks lodge in Union square for a bit of socializing and resting. 

From here we wanted some draaaaaaaaanks and bar fare so off to one of my favorite bars in the city, Tempest. If you haven’t been here, I highly recommend going. Great drinks, great food, great people. Try the fried pickles. 

After way WAY too many drinks and shots and making new friends and ending up with phone numbers in my phone that I don’t recall how they got there we made the drunk decision to head to Benders. 

Here a bitch needed to hydrate so of course a few High Noons do the trick. After an order of cheesy tots we wondered, could we eat more sweets? Of course we can. 

Turquaz is next. Not just that tall strawberry tower of creamy goodness was ordered (top left) but lamb shanks and gozleme was consumed to an already full stomach but fuck it, 42 is the meaning the life anyways, am I right? 

A Waymo was ordered and I crawled into the front door of my apartment and sat in the shower wondering why I do these things to myself but then I remember I’m in my 40’s, I live in San Francisco and this bitch can do whatever the fuck she wants. 

Thank you bitches.

They’re home. It’s the next day now. Jess is taking the kids to a water park thing. It’s a lake with a blow up obstacle course and such. Jess is braiding her hair. They’re in the bus. No whatsupfam for us. Montage of the kids being super loud in the car. Now they’re there and in life jackets. Jess kind of looks naked under hers.

Jess is getting ready for Lilia’s bday party which is the next day and Addie is getting ready to go to a sleepover. Chris is pretending to mop with chip. Jess thinks it’s hilarious. When you approach chip he rolls over for belly rubs. 

6 second Montage of the sleepover with Ayla. Jess was shopping hella late. She’s walking around saying stuff that is nothing but basically she does everything last minute and it makes things harder. 

That’s it, she hopes we have a famtastic day. Thank god for that.

No clickbait but also there was 0 interesting things in this vlog but I’m glad the kids had fun. Maybe next time they can enjoy it without filming and just be normal kids.

I recently launched a small project called [smartdomain.io ↗](https://smartdomain.io), which is focused on making domain search and recommendations smarter and more user-friendly.

It started as a tool to solve my own problem: I wanted an easier way to get domain name suggestions from AI, check if they were available, and repeat the process quickly. Some friends found it useful too, so I decided to keep improving it.

A bit about me: I come from a UX design background and am not a hardcore developer, so I built this bit by bit. Would love to get your honest feedback or suggestions!

Main features:

* Enter your idea in natural language, and the AI recommends available domains (already checked for registration status)
* You can also search for any domain directly, similar to other domain sites
* Clean, ad-free interface, and it’s completely free to use

If you’re looking for a domain for your project, product, or personal blog, give [smartdomain.io](http://smartdomain.io) a try! Happy to answer any questions or hear your thoughts in the comments.

there is also no need for me to even in the suburbs. i have no kids i dont care about the schools or the space. I will be happy living in a small apartment if that means I can do more with my life other than be confined and isolated

For now, both us and the entirety of America is under Chile's tyrannical control. 

Warera is like if RISK and RuneScape had a deeply unhinged baby. You pick a country, build a business to farm crypto (yes, really), stock up on gear, chuck on some stat-boosting cocaine, and go to war for your homeland.

It’s not a grind-heavy game, it’s about coordination, consistency, and cunning. And let’s be honest, we Kiwis have all three.

The game has its own economy, elected government ( Chile executed our government, but the president is still standing), laws, taxes (0% for all NZ players), and all the spicy politics you can handle.

We’re currently lacking the most important resource there is, population. That’s a massive strategic disadvantage... which is where YOU come in.

Join now as we try to recreate our parliament and you might become a member, voting on laws, taxes, wars and enemies.

after dropping [Day 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pattaya/comments/1lg0erp/first_time_experience/) and [Day 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pattaya/comments/1lggt1j/day_two_of_a_first_timer/), I figured instead of spamming the feed with daily updates, I've decided to throw together a **full recap of my time in Pattaya**. It's not a daily diary, but more like a messy highlight reel of everything wild, funny, or just plain ridiculous that happened along the way.

Think of it like a scuffed travel blog, just with more Red Bull, bad decisions, and questionable life choices. I’m still new to all of this, and I’m pretty sure I’ve made every rookie mistake in the book, but honestly? **I don’t care. I had an absolute blast.** This whole trip was something completely outside my usual life back home, and that’s exactly what made it so unforgettable.

---

## Day 3 – The Night Things Got Spiritual (but also very, very physical)

Still completely wrecked from the last night. Body says “no,” but **John** (not his real name — just keeping things respectful), the best bar manager in all of Pattaya, says “yes.” So I show up at his bar again. My safe space, my temple, my pregame spot. We have a few drinks, trade some stories, and then he goes: “Tonight, we do Walking Street.” Game on.

Before linking up again, I go for a solo wander: Soi Boomerang, Soi Buakhao, even Treetown. Some bars, some chats, some mild chaos. Then it's time to regroup with the legendary John and head to Walking Street.

* **First stop: Windmill.** What can I say? Windmill defies logic. It’s not a bar. It’s a state of mind. If you know, you know. If you don’t, you’ll never believe me. Let’s just say: this place is NSFW even by Pattaya standards.
* **Second stop: Chic GoGo.** John got connections, of course, I mean why not? We get comfy. While I’m mid-convo, I suddenly feel a presence. I look to my side and there she is. Didn’t see her come in. Didn’t see her sit down. Just… **spawned. Like a random sidequest.**

John leans in and says, “Bro, when did that girl appear?” I turn to her... boom. Instant glitch in my brain. **10/10 smile. Killer energy.** We start talking, I buy her a drink. Tell her she gets another if she kills it on stage. She dances. She kills it. She gets three more.

We hang out for a while and suddenly it's not just her and me, but also two of her friends and the man John himself. Squad assembled. **Drunkvengers, activate.**

We hit another bar together, then move on to Republic. At this point, it’s pure vibes. We party like there’s no tomorrow... and then suddenly it’s 7 AM and tomorrow is already here. Stumble out into daylight like gremlins.

She and I head back to my place. What happened next? Let’s just say: **sleep was not on the agenda and for once, my little friend had zero performance issues.** Full connection, no rush, no script. Just… real vibes. And yeah, I know it’s her job to make guys feel like this. I wasn’t born yesterday.

Still, when we woke up, I tried to hand her the pre-agreed apple basket. Nothing extra, just what we talked about. She straight-up pushed my hand away. No drama. Just “no.” So either she runs a secret kindness campaign for emotionally unstable farangs... or something about that night actually hit different. Like, ""**sell everything back home and help her family’s buffalo recover**""-different.

And John? Man, in just three days I came to Pattaya solo and left that night with what honestly feels like a **lifelong homie**. Real talk, you don’t expect to meet people like that out here between vodka shots and agogo lights. But somehow, I did.

---

## Day 4 – Pit Stop Mode Activated

So I wake up at like 3 PM, the girl had to leave, and I was still absolutely dead. Lying there, trying to remember what the hell even happened the night before. Brain = fried. Body = offline.

**First move? Back to 7/11.** Grab one of those holy Red Bulls (the nuclear glass bottle kind, obviously) and those god-tier toasted sandwich things. Like... what even are these? Is this the nectar of the gods? Do Thais know they cracked the snack code?

After eating like royalty and just chilling by the pool like a retired crypto bro, I text a bit with John. The plan? ""Just light drinking at the bar, no crashouts tonight."" Nice. Chill. Controlled. We’re being adults now.

So I roll up to the bar. John? Nowhere. Turns out the man straight up passed out again. Legend behavior. I drink a water (yes, actual water this time), and decide... screw it, let’s go **full spa mode**. Spark up a little green, get mildly baked, and wander back to my hotel. Then... boom. Out. Slept for like 14 hours straight. No dreams. No noise. Just... darkness. Apparently, my body filed a complaint with HR and forced a shutdown.

Not the most exciting entry, but hey, even degenerates need downtime. And honestly? Kinda nice.

---

## Day 5 – Return of the Angel... or so I thought

After sleeping for what felt like an entire era, I wake up actually not crawling straight to 7/11 for once. Instead, I go full civilized tourist and hit up a proper brunch spot.

* Food? Good.
* Coffee? Better.
* Pineapple smoothie? God-tier. (If you know, you know.)

Back at the pool, just chilling like I didn’t make 47 bad decisions in the last 72 hours. I text John to ask if he’s finally ready to actually work today. Man says yes. Alright then, pregame at the bar stands.

So I head over, grab a few drinks, have a good chat with the legend. Then I tell him I’m going back to see that angel from the A GoGo. He just gives me a knowing smile. I tell him I’ve got two days left before the ""**3-day rule**"" kicks in, so I’m still safe.

Back to the agogo I go. I walk in and yeah, she sees me instantly. Eye contact strong enough to cause early fireworks. (Pretty sure I just came.) We slide back into casual mode. Some drinks. Some chat. Vibe’s okay, not as electric as before, but still solid. Eventually, I barfine her again.

We head back to my place and... well. That’s when it gets weird. After the usual steps: shower, chill, getting comfy. She suddenly says she wants to leave. Says her friends are out partying. Okay... weird. Last time she was all in. I ask why she doesn't want to stay like before. No clear answer. Just kind of dodgy.

To be clear: I did get what I paid for; that part’s not the issue. But the energy? Totally off. Like she couldn’t get out fast enough. So I hand over the apples (just the agreed amount this time), and she heads out. No drama, no fake affection; just cold air and confused thoughts.

Honestly? I didn’t see that one coming. Not sure what changed. Not sure if I did something… or if her sponsor came back home a little earlier than expected. Let’s just say: **Night 5 was strange. Like, really strange.**

Now I’ve got no idea what I’m doing on Day 6. Might be time to recalibrate. Or maybe just go full chaos again. We’ll see.

## Day 6 – Trust Your Gut (Especially When It Smells Like Sponsorship)

Wednesday is John’s day off, so we chill and make a very simple plan: **Tonight, we go full retard mode.** Pregame at his bar, like always. Place closes at 2 AM. We drink, chat, laugh like actual friends. (For anyone thinking he’s just using me, I’ve never had so many free drinks in my life. Sometimes I pay, sometimes he does. True homie dynamic.)

There are two agogos left on LK Metro I still wanted to see: Kink and Angels. Yeah... both were kinda dead. Maybe we were too late. Maybe everyone else already saw the infamous sex elevator and moved on. But hey, had to check it off the list.

So we head back to Walking Street. Hit up a few more agogos; of course, John knows someone at every door. Some nice chats, some freebies, great vibes. Then around 3:30 AM, I tell John: “Let’s go to Chic. I want to see her again.”

So we walk in. She’s there. Looking good. Smiles. We talk a little. And thanks to John knowing Thai, the conversation goes deep fast. And... well. Turns out: **she has someone who pays her more. Like, Sponsor-Level More.**

I’m sitting there thinking: “Wait... girl, you didn’t even want apples from me the first time, what are we talking about now?” Yeah, gut punch. Kinda heartbroken. Kinda expected it. Because honestly? My gut already told me something felt off on Night 5. So I just shrug it off, keep it classy, and move on.

John and I hit a few more places, then end up at this super chill after-hours spot where all the Thai folks go post-shift. Great convos, real locals, relaxed energy. But... I’m still horny. And I kinda want to erase the angel formerly known as authentic from my system.

So yeah, **ThaiFriendly it is.** Find a girl I vibe with, we chat a bit, decide to meet up. One problem: I learn the hard way my hotel only allows girls who are 20+. She’s 19. I’m 24. Age gap is chill for me — hotel doesn’t think so. So... what now? **Plan B: I go to her place.**

Long story short: Everything went smooth, I didn’t lose a kidney, and we had a genuinely great time. Totally different vibe: no confusion, no games, just two people having a good night.

All in all, the night was weirdly healing. My gut feeling from Day 5? Spot on. Sponsor confirmed. Illusion gone. Sad? A bit. But also... kinda relieved.

---

## Day 7 – From Connect 4 to Cloud 9

The day started... weird. Woke up at the girl’s place from last night, pretty chill. Turns out she shares the room with a friend though. So at exactly 12:00, said roommate walks in. She’s probably expecting a quiet crashout and instead gets greeted by a hungover, half-naked farang starfished across her bed. I get up, throw on some clothes, mumble an apology, and exit the scene like a sitcom character after a bad punchline.

Later, John wants to “have breakfast” which obviously means around 4 PM, 555. I text him... no response. **7/11 ham & cheese sandwich it is.** Still nothing from him by 7 PM. Guess the man is either dead or reincarnating.

So I hit the restaurant at my hotel, surprisingly good, actually. I sit on the balcony, staring into the void, still waiting on John. At this point, I realize I’m not really in the mood for a crazy night... But I clean myself up anyway; gotta hear “handsome man” at least a few more times before I fly out.

Off I go, **classic Soi 6 run.** Some casual bar hopping, a bit of chit-chat, even a few games of Connect 4. Gotta say: I’m slowly getting better. Still lose more than I win, but by next year I’ll be crushing souls. (Might even take a course – ""Connect 4 for Mongers: Advanced Tactics"") Just kidding. Kinda.

After about three bars, I meet a girl with a great smile, nice curves, and she tells me she **“studied blowjobs.” Ladies and gentlemen: we have a winner.**

**Bonus:** This bar lets you buy ladydrinks online. Some poor dude (probably halfway across the world) dropped like $100 in ladydrinks on her. She happily shared them with me. Thanks bro, she's our ploy now. 🍻

We head back to my place. And let me tell you something: **That girl took me to Heaven.** Straight up the best blowjob I’ve ever had in my life. Like… Olympic-level technique.

Simple day. Not much drama. Not much emotion. But damn... solid execution. Sometimes, all a man needs is a good sandwich, a balcony view, and the throat skills of a certified Soi 6 graduate.

---

## Day 8 – Breakfast, Reflection & One Slightly Stabby MILF

Woke up to the **throat goat** from last night still being on her A-game. Honestly? Best alarm clock I’ve ever had. Might cancel my phone subscription.

Next on the agenda: Breakfast with John, this time for real. First British breakfast for me. Probably John’s 10,000th. Man orders it like a machine. Rest of the day? Pretty quiet. Bit of chilling, bit of overthinking. Had one of those ""**What the fuck am I even doing?**"" moments. Like... this is full-on sex tourism. (No regrets, just... a little reflective pause, ya know?)

The evening plan: back to Soi 6, of course. But first, one cold one with John at his bar. We hang, talk shit, people-watch. And suddenly I’m like: “**Who the actual fuck brings their kids to a red-light street?**” Like bro... half-naked girls, blackout farangs, and neon regret everywhere – what part of this screams “family outing”? Anyway. Rant over.

While I’m scanning the street, I spot a girl. Full back tattoo. Petite. Looks kind of my type. Seems about my age. So I tell John “BRB” and hop a couple bars over. Turns out... she’s older. Has two kids. Okay, mummy, don’t say another word. We chat. She’s funny. Chill vibe. So I barfine her. Off we go.

Yeah... **mummy was fucking amazing.** Proper technique, great energy, good conversation. Then, after everything’s done, she casually drops: “Oh by the way, I was in prison. Stabbed a guy who talked shit about my mum.”

... Ma’am, I think I can fix you. 555

All in all, solid day. Even better night. And I may or may not have unlocked a new kink: Not just MILFs. But **crazy MILFs with prison lore.**

---

## Day 9 – Return of the MILF (But Make It Medic)

Nothing special during the day. Bit of chilling, bit of food. Standard tourist cooldown mode. Evening rolls in, and I decide it’s time for a **round two with Mommy**. Head to her bar. We chat, drink a little, nothing crazy. Chill vibes.

I barfine her again and we head over to John’s place for a few more drinks before things go down. Bad idea. John’s in full chaos mode. One Jägerbomb after another. We go full shutdown.

Fast-forward to my hotel. Things start heating up... and about 10 minutes in Mommy taps out. She suddenly jumps up, runs to the bathroom, and yeah: Too much booze. Full system failure. So instead of a wild round two, I spend the next two hours holding her hair back, whispering motivational phrases like: ""You got this, champ."" Eventually, she passes out. We both crash.

Not the night I expected. No fireworks. No stab stories. Just some light caretaking and vomit support. But hey, sometimes you’re the main character. Sometimes you’re the nurse.

---

## Day 10 – Hit by the Goat, Saved by the MILF

So today starts off simple: I’m in desperate need of a **massage**. Like an actual, proper, no-hidden-menu, fix-my-broken-body massage. No extras. Just survival. I walk around a bit and end up picking a legit-looking place. And let me tell you: **That tiny masseuse nearly killed me on the spot.** No warning. No paperwork. I didn’t sign anything that says “not liable if your soul leaves your body.” But damn… after the near-death experience, I felt amazing. 10/10. Would get destroyed again.

Post-massage recovery? You already know where I’m heading: Back to **Day 7’s certified throat goat.** Here’s the thing though, I’m more of a night gremlin, and Soi 6 in broad daylight hits different. Not in a good way. Kinda feels like catching Santa at Walmart.

Anyway, I find her, get her a drink, tell her what I’m here for. Felt like a Seal Team 6 extraction mission – in and out in 15 minutes. And yes, it was that short. Her signature move: **Triple 360 sloppy toppy deep throat double-handed combo completely folded me.** No shame. Just relief.

Feeling like a new man, I glide into the evening. Back to Mommy (yes, the one with the prison lore). Tell her I want to barfine her for two nights. She’s happy. I’m happy. (And the price? Basically free. Guilt activated.)

We stop by John’s bar, classic move. And then I get this genius idea: “Let’s eliminate one of his girls with alcohol.” No reason. Just vibes. I start buying her shots like I’m playing bartender simulator on hard mode. Every spirit on the shelf three times over. Yeah… she passed out. In the bar. Classic. I kinda feel bad. But also, it was fun. No regrets. (Some regrets.)

Back at my hotel, I realize I might’ve killed myself too in the process. Full body shutdown. Mommy ends up taking care of me this time. Sometimes you're the problem. Sometimes you're the project. Tonight? I was both.

---

## Day 11 – One Last Ride with Mommy

So yeah, last day with the MILF. After that, she’s off for a few days to visit family or something. (I mean, cool for her and all, but let’s be honest, it’s all about the money in the end.)

Wake up call? **Morning blowjob.** While I was still asleep. Like… girl, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I also love sleep. Anyway, she finishes the mission, I roll over and doze off again. Two hours later: Round two. Some morning sex, then off to 7/11 because I’m starving.

She joins, and this woman orders a **7/11 burger as her only meal of the day.** And that’s when I realize: Every time I got something to eat, I offered, and she always said no. I thought she just wasn’t hungry. Nah. That burger might’ve been the only calories she had in 24 hours. How is she even alive?!

I decide it’s finally time to get some ""Thailand sightseeing content"" – y’know, for friends and family, so I can say I didn’t just vibe in go-gos and snack at 7/11 all day. Thailand is beautiful, don’t get me wrong... But I’m not in Pattaya to admire ancient temples, let’s be real.

Turns out, the MILF has never seen anything in Pattaya either. She’s been to her bar and the 7/11 next door. That’s it. So I’m like: “Screw it — come with me.” We hit up the **Sanctuary of Truth.** Pretty impressive, honestly. Cultural. Majestic. Full of tourists pretending they care more than they do. But yeah, I think I still prefer bars and women.

We head back to the hotel, do our thing, chill for a bit. Later, she says we should check out a bar where her sister works. Is it really her sister? No clue. Don’t care. Off we go. Light drinking. Bit of shit chat. Back to my hotel. End the night with some more good ol' MILF action. Nothing crazy. Nothing new. But a solid last ride with Mommy.

---

## Day 12 – Liquor Tasting & Personal Freedoms

Not the most exciting day. Mommy had to leave relatively early; she’s got two days off and apparently some stuff to do in Bangkok. I stayed in, slept a bit longer, enjoyed the peace. Early afternoon, I treated myself to a proper massage. No special. Just oil, hands, and recovery. Then straight to the pool for some chill time.

Evening comes, and I head over to John’s bar. He actually said **“We’re friends now.”** Bro... I really hope we are at this point. We chat, have a few drinks, good vibes as always.

And then I decide to give one of his girls a **personal liquor tasting of the entire menu.** Look, I know how this works. John benefits (more drinks sold), the girl benefits (drinks for her), and technically I don’t get much out of it. I’m not taking her with me, I just like the energy. But honestly? It’s my vacation. My money. My fun. If anyone’s got a problem with that, you know where to go.

After around 25 shots, she basically had to barfine herself; she couldn’t even stand anymore. Kinda dark. Kinda funny. Kinda... Pattaya.

After that, John and I strolled down Walking Street, grabbed a few more drinks, and just took in the chaos like two old pirates watching the younger crew burn the ship down.

Later that night, I did some casual Browse on ThaiFriendly. Met up with a girl... **Semi-catfished.** Not ugly, just... noticeably thicker than her photos from 2018. Still nice enough.

Good day. Low stakes. Just pure, self-chosen degeneracy.

---

## Day 13 – Final Countdown (Literally)

Last day. Final ride. Time to go out with a bang. (Almost literally.)

John and I got “breakfast” at like 4 PM, so yeah, more like a slow lunch with eggs. It’s his day off, so we plan the big finale.

The plan?
* Ping Pong Show ✅
* Soi 6 run ✅
* Chaos ✅

Let’s go.

**Ping Pong Show** first, you know, classic tourist bucket list. Honestly? Not as wild as I expected, but still... impressive? Like how does one discover they can do these things? Still, felt a bit meh. One of those “cool to say I’ve seen it” things.

Then off to Soi 6. God, I love that street. There’s just something about walking through Soi 6 that makes you feel like the **hottest guy in Southeast Asia.** You don’t even need to try. That street just gasses you up.

5 bars in, and I swear: **How many people does John even KNOW?** Everywhere we go: “Hey John!” free shots, free hugs, free chaos. By 2 AM, most places close... but of course John knows all the bars that stay open late. We’re absolutely hammered at this point. Women. Booze. Chaos. Honestly? Don’t remember much. But I know it was insane.

Around 4 AM, hunger hits – McDonald's run. From there, things get blurry. Like... severely blurry. Bolt driver drops me off in the wrong place. I’m lost. **Wallet gone.** Drunk as hell. I start walking back to the hotel, no clue how I made it; GPS hero mode.

Suddenly, a ladyboy appears, offers to help. I’m really not in the mood. I just want sleep. I’m standing there, trying to read Google Maps through drunk goggles... ...and she just grabs my dick. Not from the outside. Not asking. **Full street-level handjob initiative.** I back off like: “Excuse me, ma’am, not tonight.” Sprint away like a drunk ninja.

Finally make it back to my hotel. Tell staff what happened (still plastered). About 30 minutes later, the hotel phone rings. Some random guy found my wallet. No money, of course. But I got my ID back. Honestly? That’s all I needed.

Two hours of sleep. Still completely wasted. No idea how I packed. Airport mode: activated.

Pattaya… You beautiful, chaotic mess. You chewed me up, spat me out, and somehow I’m still smiling.

All in all? **What. A. Trip.** It was wild, messy, chaotic, beautiful and exactly what I needed. Would I do things differently next time? Maybe. Will I come back anyway and do it just as stupid again? Absolutely.

Next trip’s already in the making.
* **Destination: Pattaya.**
* **Status: Mentally unstable but fully ready.**
Let’s fucking go.

1lrpwki,https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/1lrpwki/what_happens_when_you_sit_it_out/,What happens when you sit it out,"Someone asked me to post this separately, so I figured I would.  Mods—take it down if this isn’t okay.

****** 

You get what you put out.  You put out hate of others, you’ll get hate back.  You push hatred out on women or other adults—that’s what you’ll get back.  You push out discrimination, well, you’ll get that back.  If you have hate for yourself, you will treat yourself badly and you will keep hating yourself because you will believe that you aren’t worthy of love or anything but hate.  So, that’s a choice you have to make for yourself.

The world may be against you.  Maybe more than ever before.  Maybe things are worse than any time than before.  But hating yourself won’t solve it.  Hating others won’t solve it.  It won’t make the world easier.  It won’t make people love you.  It won’t make anything happen that will at all be what you might want.

What will work is getting in the action and playing the game.  Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson and Muhammad Ali didn’t sit in the stands grumbling that it wasn’t fair.  They played the game.  Gordon Ramsay doesn’t sit in the hotel—he’s in the kitchen, in the office, and doing the work.  Alex Hirsh didn’t pop popcorn on the couch and wait—he created Gravity Falls.  Team Cherry?  Mojang?  Rovio?  They didn’t just hate that others were doing things and declare that they weren’t going to do anything.  They went ahead and took a chance and made stellar games.  These people trained and studied and spent untold hours analyzing everything and every aspect, training and repeatedly going up and trying again.  They got up in the mornings and went to work.  They trained.  They went up and then they failed, lost and got discouraged.  Then they went back and tried again.

The people that you look up to and the people that people look up to?  They are going to lose.  They are going to fail.  They may break even and they may succeed.  And then they may fail again.  But they keep trying.  They keep standing up to bat and taking the swing.  And they know they are going to fail again.  They know that they won’t win every time, but they keep playing the game.  If you ask any of them—you’ll find that succeeding on the first try isn’t really a thing and that 99.99% were the second, third, tenth or 47th try.

It is a free country, of course.  It’s a choice to just give up.  You can make this choice.  You can totally choose to sit out and wait for whatever it is that you’re waiting for.

And you know what happens when you choose to sit out?  Let me tell you.

My brother is nearly 50.

He’s chosen to sit out his whole life.  No job.  No resume.  No apartment or anything.  He lives with mom and plays video games and maybe occasionally do a chore.  Otherwise, he’s decided he’s done and chooses to sit it out.

At 50.

At this point, he’s done.  If he starts right now, he’ll be fighting for minimum wage jobs with teenagers because he has no resume, no experience, no credit and no history.  He’s too old to get a start by joining the military.  He will be most likely in his mom’s house forever.  He will most likely never have a  living wage—especially in this economy—and will be fighting for the most minimal studio apartment.  If he doesn’t ever get on the lists and apply for housing, he’ll never even have subsidized housing and doubly now that all of those programs will be cut or eliminated.  So, he probably has an exciting future (eventually) either couch surfing or being homeless.  A stellar future as a fry cook or fast food worker.  He will be fighting to have enough money to pay for rent and groceries—let alone the next video games or console.

At 50.

He will miss so much.

He will not marry his college sweetheart and spend 50 years with her.  He will not have children while he is young enough to play with them.  He will definitely not have money to send them to college.  He will never trade his clunker and get his dream car.  He will never have a place with his own rules.  He’ll never have his mother over to his own place for coffee.  Never have a Christmas with his own tree and decorations.  He’ll never be able to redecorate his living room with new furniture.  He’ll never have a barbecue with his friends at his own place over a long weekend.  He’ll never get promoted to a senior position.  Probably never get published as a researcher or part of a team that will do the next Silksong or Overwatch.  He’ll never be able to move into his dream home from his starter place.  He’ll never have the chance to eat exactly what he wants when he wants.  Never have a workshop or game room that is to his own specifications, rather than what his mother wants.  He’ll never have a lazy snow day where he sits by his window with a beverage of choice and doesn’t have work or school.  He’ll never be able to decide for himself that he wants to stay up until dawn or sleep in until noon.

Assuming that things go the way that they have been.

* He’ll have an exciting career in the fast food industry.  At 50, slinging sodas or waiting tables or being a janitor at minimum wage as his “starting” job.
* He’ll never have a car except whatever junker he’s given by his mother.  Assuming he has a driver’s license and can afford insurance, of course.
* He’ll never retire or have a reserve of money to retire on.  Programs that will give him help often don’t allow you to have “too much” savings or “too high” income.
* He’ll never get prime rates because no credit history is the same as bad credit history.  So everything from a car to an apartment will be more expensive and charge him more.
* He’ll never own property—a house or boat or the like.  He’ll be struggling to get a car on his own at first.
* He’ll never host an epic party in his own space because he’ll be struggling to pay for any space, let alone privacy.
* He’ll never have equity in real estate and have that as a cushion.
* He’ll be fighting to find someone’s couch to sleep on.
* He’ll be hauling all of his belongings around because he’ll have nowhere to go.  That means no game systems anymore and no where to play them.  It will probably mean he’ll be selling it all.
* He’ll be having to follow his mother’s rules for as long as she lives.  She doesn’t want him wearing red, he’ll have to obey.  Every rule.  Every time.  For as long as she lives.
* He’ll never be assured of having property or an inheritance because by default it will be her husband, which means that he’ll be an orphan and inherit that way or he’ll be living with his stepfather and subject to that one’s rules.
* He’ll spend his elderly years homeless because eventually he’ll run out of people that want to house him and can afford to support him doing nothing, eating their groceries, sleeping in their space, using their utilities.

He has chosen to sit things out.  He has watched as everyone around him has grown and changed, worked, succeeded and failed.  He has lived in mom’s house, playing video games.  He’s let it all slide past and let go of all the opportunities he’s had.  **And that window has been closing**.  At this point, he will just have to see what fate has in store and face it as a homeless, most likely jobless or severely underpaid, elderly man with absolutely nothing.  And since he’s burned every bridge behind him, then he’ll be running out of “friends” quite soon, so picture an 60-70 year old haggling at a pawn shop for $20 more for an outdated game console so he can afford to go to a hotel and that’s probably close.

Yes, you can make a choice to sit things out.  To “protest” by not working and not going to school and not participating in life.  You can totally choose to never do anything with your life.  And choosing to not participate won’t change and make time not pass.  Time will still pass.  Friends will go on to new jobs and opportunities.  Family will grow older and will still keep going and still die.  Women will still go on and marry and have fun.  Children will still be born.  Couples will form and couples will dissolve.  Time will still pass and the window will close.  And you will still wake up at 40 or 50 or older and you will get what you put out.  You will wake up and realize that you are 40 or 50 or older and that you will have whatever life you have built with your choices.  No matter who you are or where you are—*the window will close* and time will pass and take opportunities with it.",2,1751653832.0,IncelTears,1,0.75,False

This place doesn’t just kill your spirit — it buries it under a pile of broken room service trays and passive-aggressive emails.

**Management?** Completely absent when you need help, and hovering like vultures when you make the slightest mistake. I was once written up for “not smiling enough” during a double shift with no break, no lunch, and a guest screaming at me because the elevator smelled like wet dog. And no, they didn’t do anything about the elevator. Ever.

**Training?** If you consider being thrown behind the desk with zero guidance and told, *“You’ll figure it out,”* training — then sure, it’s top-notch. I learned more from watching confused guests than I ever did from the manager.

**The guests?** Half are wonderful people trying to enjoy their vacation — the other half treat you like a buttonless robot programmed only to nod and say, “Absolutely, I’ll take care of that.” Spoiler: no one takes care of anything. You're expected to smile and lie through your teeth while hoping the linen closet isn't on fire again.

**Housekeeping is understaffed, overworked, and underpaid.** We regularly ran out of basic supplies — towels, soap, sometimes even toilet paper. One time we had to fold washcloths into squares and pretend they were hand towels. “Just get creative,” they said. Hospitality magic, right?

**And forget work-life balance.** The schedule was a sick joke. Days off got canceled, shifts changed with zero notice, and if you dared to say no, you got ghosted from the schedule the next week.

Also, **HR? Doesn’t exist.** At least, not in any meaningful way. Report an issue and it vanishes into the void, never to be addressed. You’re basically told, “We’re like a family here” — yes, a toxic, dysfunctional family with a broken coffee machine and no escape plan.

**Bottom line:** Working here drained me emotionally, physically, and mentally. The turnover rate is so high they should install a revolving door at the employee entrance. You are disposable, replaceable, and underappreciated.

**Don’t work here. Don’t apply here.** If you’ve already applied, pretend you didn’t. If they call you, don’t answer. Save yourself the misery.",0,1751653730.0,Redding,11,0.35,False

Every weekend felt like a war between my brain and my bed. One part of me said, *""Rest, you deserve it""*, and the other said, *""If you don’t build it, no one will.""*

There were times I didn’t write a single line of code for days — not because I was too busy, but because I was **burned out or demotivated**. Sometimes I’d open Unity, stare at the screen, and just close it.

But I reminded myself: I **really love making games**. Even if it’s slow, even if it's messy, even if no one notices — it’s still mine. That thought kept me going.

So I kept chipping away — one puzzle, one bug, one dialog box at a time. Finally, I finished and published my first Android game. It’s an **escape room-style puzzle game** where you find clues, connect them logically, and unlock the gate.

[Play game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.KankaneGames.StrangeRoom&hl=en_IN)

The game isn't perfect. But it’s real. And it’s out. And that feeling... man, it’s worth every hour.

If you’re stuck, tired, or doubting yourself: I feel you. But don’t quit. Keep building — even if it's just one line of code at a time. You never know what you'll create. 🚀

Back in 2000 I hiked 230 miles of the Appalachian Trail. I was part of a group of 9 people. We had been on the trail for about a week, and had just experienced our first terrible night of rain and wind and just a miserable experience. 

The next day we only hiked about 4 miles and decided to setup camp early in the afternoon near a shelter that was already full of other hikers. As we were building our fire and putting up our tents, one of the guys in the group was rifling through his pack and suddenly gasped in surprise. We watched in suspense as he pulled out a jar of Folders instant coffee. He had forgotten that he had packed it. 

Let me tell you that the smell of that coffee heating up over the campfire was the most incredible smell anyone has ever smelled. Out in the deep dark woods, exhausted and frustrated by our previous night's experience, that coffee was like an health-giving elixir.

We all enjoyed a cup. We laughed and told stories and sipped that precious elixir for an hour or more, and to this day it is one of my absolutely favorite memories. ",2,1751653457.0,stories,2,1.0,False

When I was young, i had a best friend and childhood love that I hung out with all day, both our families had to travel a lot, so my experience would be 1 year together all the time, then a year apart then 3 months together all the time, the 2 years apart then 6 months together all THE time...this finally came to an end when she moved away from my hometown and settled in another state 

during my teenage years, I was in a very bad space, I had moved to a place where I was bullied and shunned due to being an outsider. I developed self doubt and self loathing and horrible self esteem. I also developed a eating disorder due to the bullying and grew chubby. 

My best friend came to visit me multiple driving 12 hours somethimes, I was too embarrassed to show her my face, I was not the cool kid anymore, I was a looser. She would sit with my mother talking about stuff while I stayed in my room pretending to play minecraft while sobbing into my pillow. Visits grew infrequent, until we lost all contact. 

It's around this time it started, every other fucking week, dreams about her, about her never leaving our hometown, about us still being best friends, about us moving in together, EVERY OTHER WEEK. I was never attracted to anyone, never grew a crush on anyone, because my only love was the fantasy version of her in my head. Thought I learnt to live with it and not think about her as much anymore 

Fast forward 7 years, I'm 21, and I got a internship offer 15 mins from her place. I was there for 3 months. I was too scared to contact her for 2 months. Terrified. Finally had the guts to contact her, and asked her to catch up over coffee 

AND HOLY SHT, you know how I was In love with this perfect fantastic version of her? Well the real her turned out to be a literal GODESS, she was the most beautiful person I couldn't even imagine, she shared the same hobbies as me, same life goals, had ambitions, no relationships, smart, could hold intellectual conversations. Those 4 hours I spent with her were the best 4 hours of my life in the last 15 years. I can't stop thinking about her, I wanna be with her all the time, I came back and cried the whole night because I knew that I had no chance with her, but I wanted to do nothing but be with her. 

I sent her a text every day, and she replied positively, but she was never really initiating conversations, or much of anything else, just replies, until a few days ago, she asked if I would like to hang out with her for lunch, I can't tell you the ecstacy I felt meeting up with her, I had work that day, but I took the day off, dropped all plans, literally jumped out of my chair to visit her. Another heavenly 2 hours 

Dunno where I'm going with this but it's been 3 days and I still can't do anything but think about her.  ",3,1751653209.0,limerence,2,1.0,False

1lrpnb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/forfractionals/comments/1lrpnb8/website_teardown_neils_fractional_cto_site/,Website Teardown - Neil’s Fractional CTO Site,"# 

A Fractional on yesterday’s Fractional CTO and VPE Lean Coffee - we’ll call him Neil - requested a website teardown. I won’t share his name or website publicly, but I bet this applies to a lot of folks out there. You’ve seen it before.

It’s clean. Professional. And completely forgettable.

And that’s the problem.

# Summary

Honestly, overall, it’s fine - generic CTO, but fine as a starting point. This is peak “professional services template” - clean, competent, and completely forgettable. You could probably delete 50% of the content and be just as fine. Your name is clear, access to your LinkedIn (which is your primary source of truth right now) is scattered around.

But there’s no real positioning or focus. There’s no content, no opinion, absolutely nothing to make you stand out from a crowd of CTOs who are fractionalized.

# This Isn’t a Services Menu - It’s a CTO Panic Attack

Services page (and the non-overlapping engagement options on the home page) - that’s….a lot of services. How big is your team again?

**The 12-Service Disaster:** Strategic Staffing, Team Leadership, Innovation & Growth, Interim CTO Support, Technical Strategy, Engineering Best Practices, Architecture Review, Scalability Strategy, Security & Compliance, Product Alignment, Vendor Management, and Technology Budgeting. You’re one person. This isn’t a consulting firm of 50 people.

But wait - are these actually services, or just a list of everything a CTO eventually touches? The shotgun “I can do everything” pitch might work… but that’s not a service. That’s just being a CTO.

And the “value delivered” blurbs? They don’t land. Without a clear audience, they collapse into filler language that could apply to any company, any decade.

Each card has the same structure, the same length, the same bland corporate tone. By the time you hit “Security & Compliance,” the reader’s already checked out.

# Where’s Neil? (The Personality Vacuum)

Content and opinion wise - looking at LinkedIn, you have both. Videos, text, proper opinions. Why isn’t this reflected in the website? I might not agree with your opinions - but that’s the point. You want clients who either agree and say “Yay Neil!” OR you want clients to say “WTF Neil? are you crazy?” and then they keep thinking about what you said.

**Your about me blurb skips all the important stuff and just buzzwords.** Exactly like every CTO. “I help senior leaders navigate complicated technology decisions.” This sentence could describe literally any CTO in America.

It’s not until the 3rd section that it starts to talk about what you achieved and even then…you neutered it. If I want to find out who that music tech startup was, I have to go look at LinkedIn. This isn’t secret information… Same with all of the other roles. You’re clearly not under NDA since the names are all over LinkedIn. Name the companies, talk about the actual problems you solved.

The client logos - if they make it to the bottom of your testimonials page - are left to do heavy lifting for credibility.

# There Is, However, One Thing That Almost Works

The 4th panel on the home page - your “Build-Phase Accelerator” - is the only thing on the site that looks and reads like a real service offering.

It’s not just a capability list. It’s a packaged solution.

It names the stage (build), the structure (CTO + Dev Team), and the buyer (a company building fast but not ready for a full tech org). It even sketches out the pain: needing execution and technical oversight without hiring.

Is it perfect? No. It still plays a little safe - “trusted,” “experienced,” “quality” - but structurally? This is the shape. This is what an offer looks like.

So why is it buried in your homepage like a leftover CTA?

Why does the “More” button take me to your About page?

Why not a dedicated landing page - with pricing, timeline, case studies, and a clear sales process?

If this is your wedge - your one true offer - everything else should serve it. Instead, it’s an afterthought.

You’ve got a service. Name it. Package it. Sell it like it’s your lead product - not a half-hidden idea buried at the bottom of your homepage.

# A Few Things That Aren’t Huge - But Add Up

**Contact form psychology:** “Ready to transform your technology strategy?” - this could be copy-pasted from any B2B SaaS website. Though “What’s Your Biggest Tech Challenge?” is actually smart - it gets people thinking about problems rather than just sending “Hi, I need help with stuff” emails.

**Testimonials page:** Scroll down, and click to the side? It’s 3 testimonials….is scrolling down so bad? Poor navigation for no reason.

**FAQ navigation disaster:** FAQ is only at the bottom of the expertise, and it’s got too many navigation paths (is it a puzzle or a faq?) - tabs, tab scroll, and unfurls?!

# What’s Actually Working

* The scarcity trick is not bad
* Clean design - site looks professional
* Clear navigation structure (except where it fails)
* Contact forms are low friction
* Your accelerator offering (the only differentiated thing)

# Bottom Line

You have the content and opinions on LinkedIn that could differentiate you. The website just doesn’t reflect any of it. It’s a generic CTO template when you clearly have more personality and expertise than that. You’ve built a competent, professional website that does absolutely nothing to differentiate you from the 10,000 other fractional CTOs who launched this year.

Even if you don’t publish everything to your website (tip: you should.) at least align it to your opinions - a few highlight pieces, some embeds of your video series, whatever.

# Bonus Round: The Exit Popup Nobody Wants

There’s also an exit popup - “Get Your Free Tech Score” - that tries to catch people before they leave. In theory, this could be a clever hook. In practice, it’s just annoying.

I didn’t see it naturally - probably blocked by uBlock, or maybe because closing tabs is how I leave websites like a normal human being. Neil had to send me a direct link to it.

The form itself isn’t awful. It’s got decent segmentation: stage, team size, leadership presence, tech challenge. That’s actually a smart way to qualify leads if the follow-up is good. But a popup? On exit? That’s pure friction. And unless the output is truly valuable (spoiler: it’s probably not) - it’s just a speed bump on the way out.

Instead, a lot of folks use something like this on lead-magnet content - a free ebook PDF, access to whitepapers, a short teardown, something that aligns with your actual target audience. (You have one, right?)

The goal isn’t to guilt someone into filling out a form as they’re trying to leave. It’s to offer something they might actually want while they’re still paying attention. A popup at exit is just noise unless it delivers something useful enough to make the interruption worth it.

You’re trying to start a relationship. Not throw a clipboard in someone’s face on their way out the door.

I posted in another area but unfortunately didn't get any responses, so I'm hoping posting here will help.

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase:** $1200-1500 CAD or less ideally, but I'm flexible.
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** No. Brand new only.
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Build quality, performance and battery life are all important for me.
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** The lighter, the better, but not a deal breaker. Thinness doesn't matter to me.
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** Between 15-16""ish ideally.
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Yes. I'm a graphic designer and light gamer. I mainly use Photoshop and Illustrator as well as Word and Excel. I do tend to run multiple browsers/tabs and programs at the same time. As for games, I've only been playing Doomsday: Last Survivors at the moment. I'm not a hardcore PC gamer but may get more into it.
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** Outside of what I mentioned above, likely MMO/RPG genres, nothing specific in mind though.
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** Full/backlit keyboard, well-built overall, great speed, strong Wi-Fi capability, decent storage (I do have a 4TB external drive but rarely ever use it... only for backups), good graphics/sound quality, at least 2 USB ports and 1 HDMI port, doesn't run hot or flicker constantly, fairly quiet operation. No need for a touch screen. A built-in camera would be nice. A CD drive would also be nice but not mandatory (I have an external one and rarely use it).
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Primary uses will be browsing/multitasking, graphic design, light gaming, and streaming movies. The last laptop I owned was a MacBook Pro. While I liked it overall, I didn’t love it. I mainly used it while studying graphic design, as it was suggested for the program. I know Macs are great laptops, but I prefer Windows. I’m looking for a laptop that is ready to go out of the box, will last me a while, and won’t need internal upgrades (at least for the short-term). I already have a custom-built gaming PC at home that’s lasted me about three years and still runs like new. This laptop will mainly be used when I’m out and about (like at a coffee shop or something)—to get things done or unwind during downtime. I wouldn’t be using it every day, so I may not even need to spend the full budget. I've seen a lot of people recommend this one: https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/hp-victus-16-1-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-8845hs-16gb-ddr5-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-512gb-ssd-mica-silver/18171014.

I can follow suggested in/out/time expectations but I don't know how it applies if I use preinfusion. How much time should I add to the TBT? Adding the amount of preinfusion time I set the machine to doesn't exactly work because liquid immediately comes out once preinfusion ends, but without preinfusion, liquid comes out some seconds after pressing the button.

So far I've been dialing based only on in/out/approximate time (as long as it's not way under 20s or way over 40s). The pressure gauge on this machine I've heard it kind of inaccurate as well so I don't know how much I trust it. With taste, I'm in the ballpark of ""it tastes decent"" but it's hard to me to know which way to go to make it taste better. I can only really tell if it's very unpleasantly under or over extracted.",1,1751652977.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I don't think I diluted it enough, at least my GF thought so lol. About an hour later my throat felt extremely dry and felt like a sore throat. I've been sneezing frequently so I thought maybe it was post nasal drip. I keep having to clear my throat and constantly swallow. It's a little better today but still irritating, feels like a sore/swollen throat. I don't feel sick at all, and before I drank the lemonade I had 3 clementines. I've never had this reaction to lemonade before, so I was wondering did I just not dilute it enough + the clementines I ate earlier? I drink 1-3 cups of coffee a day also. I took an allegra and that didn't do anything. Just curious cause I've never had this happen before, thank you!",0,1751652909.0,Allergies,3,0.5,False

Sometimes, I overeat sugary stuff (due to periods, stress & such, it's like I'm hurt, might as well, cuz I actually prefer spice when I'm alr yk). Have noticed that feeling more than FULL makes me repeat this overeating or doesn't lemme eat normally for a few days & messes up exercise. Whereas if I'm travelling my body seamlessly switches to needing as little food as possible. Was thinking of doing 24hr fast after binges to let my body reset & maybe doing a weekly full day mild fast where I can drink black coffee, water, some nuts & dry blueberries & a nutritious dinner. Does anyone here do stuff like this? Ik people who do bi-weekly for religious purposes. I wanna try but just don't want more weekly inflammation. I wanna get read of this habbit of overeating cuz ik if I don't do it 4-6months I'd never do it again & it would really help me mentally.",0,1751652901.0,1200isplenty,3,0.5,False
1lrpisg,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1lrpisg/met_someone_in_a_similarly_toxic_relationship_to/,Met someone in a similarly toxic relationship to one I was in years ago and he’s so damn tormented and I feel a huge sense of “thank god this is not me anymore”,"In 2020 I got into a relationship with a girl. I’m a drug user/addict and those first months felt like a continuous high unparalleled by anything I tried besides maybe heroin and mdma, which this period felt remotely alike. 

First red flag was weeks in but it was actually the hook that got me because I had a cold, distant mother who would also throw abusive replies when she was stressed. So the girl went mia one day and it lasted thru the whole day. I was worried sick that something happened to her, didn’t think about anything. She came back online the next day saying she smoked lots of weed and slept all day.   Soon after she said we might need to split up because her family is opening a coffee shop in the capital and she’s needed to manage the place (she has no formal education for this nor experience past barrista).She months later drunkenly confessed that her ex was the one with the coffee shop and she thought about it and chose me. I now see this as half truth. 


After this more and more stuff happened, exploding out of nowhere, talking to ppl online and gaslighting me about it until somehow i found out and many other vile types of acts. In my 7 years of drug use at that point I never needed medical attention and after two years with her and her episodes, I wasn’t equipped to handle any of it and turned to what I knew. I had 2 gcs 3 comas and a psych ward visit on shrooms while in this relationship. 


Anyway this guy, 24 ish beautiful and loving dude but emotionally immature and very teenager like in behaviour and speech got hired as bartender where I work. We connected over drug use on cocaine obviously and because he was drunk high and traumatised and having no one to speak to about this he randomly dropped the phone in my face to read a convo. He bas basically trying to be supportive about a pain she had and she burst in insults and telling him he’s making her worse. I forgot to mention he’s always chatting to her on his phone via messages like 24/7 (smth i also did with my ex) and in between there are calls a few times a day when she’s threatening a break up.

Today we met again to ride the slopes and have a beer, he first postponed the time we planned and he randomly was ready to go earlier than the second planned time. We meet, buy the thing, get to mine and rack some up, no more than 25 mins pass and he calls her. Another fight. Basically she asked him to fck off before which she did and she waited for him to settle in to start another fight over why he did what she asked him to. Then he begged her to wait up bcs he s about to get a taxi. And he bounced.


I’m so glad and relieved this isn’t me anymore. Life of a drug addict is pretty bad obviously but WAY easier than putting up with ts.

//while writting this he called, she told him to fk off so he’s coming back
