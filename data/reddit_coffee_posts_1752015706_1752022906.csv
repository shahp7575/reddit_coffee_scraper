Hi there! 

Looking for a genuine connection. Enjoy meeting new people and having a good conversation. Nothing particular in mind, would like to start with something friendly and casual, and if something develops from there, open to it. 

I get along best with people that are grounded, smart, funny, witty, take care of themselves (I‚Äôm not perfect but I try to do the best I can) and that can hold a conversation :) 

About me:
- Easy going, friendly
- Enjoy reading, writing, binging Netflix - the last series I watched was Dept Q
- WFH - lots of time in between meetings 
- Love summer nights and walks 
- Like travelling (who doesn‚Äôt) 
- Enjoy a good pizza, brownie, brunch or coffee 

If you feel we would connect, say hi :) 

P.S. Would prefer someone in the EST time zone if possible :) makes conversation easier and around 35 or older, ideally. ",1,1752022508.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

Tea has always been a sort of comfort drink in a family full of coffee drinkers. Some weeks ago I found this subreddit by chance, and heard of teas I didn't even know existed, so, to prepare for an intense college semester, I made a purchase of 4 new teas for in between my study sessions: a yellow tea from Hunan, China; a milk oolong from Taiwan (Jin Xuan/Golden Lily, if I'm putting the names in wrong order excuse me I'm still getting used to the different aspects of tea and origins); Dragonwell green tea from Zhejiang, China; and finally an Ali Shan tea from Fujian, China.

These will be the first ones of their type I've ever tried so any tips or recommendations for brewing would be appreciated! 

So far, I've simply tasted tea without last names like black tea in bags, or leaf tea without an idea of origin or nothing. My most complex knowledge is matcha, and I'm an avid drinker of it (I whisk it and all, the best part of my mornings), and so far, my other favorite is white tea (I call it just that because I literally have no idea beyond that, the original bag in back at my parent's place and I'm so, so far from there), and a nameless old jasmine tea. I'm not sure (besides matcha) if how I've tasted them is their true and original flavor because my parents aren't the best at storing them, and got a lot of light and oxygen for the past years, so what I'm drinking it's probably not well preserved tea, which only makes me more excited for the ones that will arrive in the weekend!

In terms of equipment, I have only occidental brewing methods (a metal filter with very small gaps/holes) because well, I'm a college student with not much space in my dorm. However I usually remove the filter at different times to make a sort of gongfu style brewing to taste different notes, and brewing it a couple times (the tea I have is good quality! I just don't know the details sadly), respecting the temperature (I check it with a common thermometer) and time of brewing.

So yeah! I'd be glad to hear about any recommendations or things to look in these incoming teas to learn more of the fascinating world of tea ü§ç",2,1752022477.0,tea,0,1.0,False

When I originally researched it, I found multiple sites saying that it was 40 mg per serving. Based on the amount I drink, I was still consuming more than the recommended daily amount...about 400 mg per day...but prior to being pregnant I drank around 1000 mg per day, so 400 was still a significant decrease for me. 

Well now, upon further research, it looks like it's actually 50-90 mg of caffeine per serving which could mean I have been ingesting up to 800 mg per day!!!! The baby's heartbeat was fine at my last appointment but my blood pressure was higher than normal, although I am going through a separation and am a stay at home mom to a toddler and my tween now that it's summer, so my stress level has been through the roof. My OB wasn't concerned about my blood pressure at all.

I didn't realize that caffeine crosses the placenta and baby cannot metabolize it. So now I am wondering what damage could have been done! Probably a lot!!!!

I'm sure no one else has consumed nearly this amount on a daily basis, so I don't really know what I'm looking for here. Just super super worried.

1lv5gaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1lv5gaj/how_to_unfck_your_life_after_months_of_doing/,How to Unf*ck Your Life After Months of Doing Nothing,"I spent like 8 months last year in full zombie mode. Zero motivation. Zero drive. Couldn't even be bothered to be productive some days. So I went full detective mode on myself, tested a bunch of shit, and actually figured out how to get my motivation back.

(This is organized by levels, but honestly, it all connects.)

LEVEL 1: The Basics (Do These First)

‚óè STOP LYING TO YOURSELF:

Write down what you ACTUALLY do all day. Not what you think you do. Track it for 3 days. The results will hurt, but you can't fix what you won't acknowledge.

‚óè CLEAN YOUR DAMN SPACE:

Your environment affects your brain more than you think. Messy room = messy thoughts. Start with your bed. Make it every morning. Takes 2 minutes, gives you one instant win.

‚óè DITCH THE ALL-OR-NOTHING BULLSH\*T:

Stop planning perfect routines you'll never stick to. Instead of ""I'll work out for 2 hours,"" commit to putting on workout clothes. That's it. Momentum builds from there.

‚óè KILL THE ENERGY VAMPIRES:

Social media rabbit holes, toxic people, doom-scrolling news. Cut this shit out. Your brain has limited bandwidth. Stop wasting it on garbage.

‚óè MOVE (EVEN TINY AMOUNTS):

Quick Walks: Even 5 mins around the block. Gets your blood moving.

Desk Push-ups: 5 against your desk. Sounds stupid, works great.

Dance Like an Idiot: Put on one song. Move your body. I don't care how you look.

LEVEL 2: The Game-Changers

‚óè FIND YOUR DOPAMINE LEAKS:

Realized I was getting easy dopamine hits from phone games, Netflix binges, and junk food. My brain had no reason to work for harder rewards. Cut the cheap hits, and suddenly real accomplishments felt good again.

‚óè THE 2-MINUTE RULE:

Any task under 2 minutes? Do it NOW. Reply to that text. Put dishes in the dishwasher. File that document. Stops the mental pile-up that kills motivation.

‚óè IDENTITY SHIFT:

Instead of ""I want to be productive,"" I started thinking ""I'm someone who shows up."" Small change, massive difference in how I approached tasks.

‚óè BATCH YOUR DECISIONS:

Meal prep Sundays. Lay out clothes the night before. Automate what you can. Decision fatigue is real, and it murders motivation.

LEVEL 3: The Psychological Stuff

‚óè EMBRACE THE SUCK:

Stopped waiting to ""feel motivated."" Started doing things BECAUSE I didn't feel like it. Motivation follows action, not the other way around.

‚óè TRACK WINS, NOT FAILURES:

Kept a ""done"" list instead of a to-do list. Wrote down everything I accomplished, no matter how small. Folded laundry? Goes on the list. Answered emails? List it.

‚óè ACCOUNTABILITY WITHOUT SHAME:

Found one person to check in with weekly. Not to judge, just to witness. ""This week I did X, next week I'm aiming for Y."" No guilt trips, just gentle pressure.

‚óè MORNING MOMENTUM:

First hour of the day sets the tone. No phone, no news, no social media. Just 3 simple tasks that make me feel like I'm winning before 9 AM.

LEVEL 4: The Advanced Stuff

‚óè REVERSE ENGINEER YOUR EXCUSES:

Made a list of my top 5 excuses. ""I'm too tired."" ""I don't have time."" ""I'll start Monday."" Then I systematically removed each excuse. Tired? Go to bed earlier. No time? Track where time actually goes.

‚óè MICRO-REWARDS:

Set tiny rewards for completing tasks. Finished that report? 10 minutes of guitar. Cleaned the kitchen? One episode of something good. Train your brain that work = good things.

‚óè THE SUNDAY RESET:

Every Sunday, 30 minutes to:

Review what worked/didn't work this week

Set 3 priorities for next week

Prep anything that'll make Monday easier

‚óè ENERGY MANAGEMENT > TIME MANAGEMENT:

Tracked when I had the most energy vs. when I had the least. Scheduled hard tasks during peak energy times. Stopped fighting my natural rhythms.

LEVEL 5: The Uncommon Stuff

‚óè CREATIVE CONSTRAINTS:

Gave myself artificial deadlines and limitations. ""I have 25 minutes to write this email."" Pressure creates focus when motivation is low.

‚óè BODY DOUBLING:

Worked alongside someone else (in person or on video call). Didn't matter what they were doing. Just having another person ""working"" nearby kept me accountable.

‚óè THE PHONE IN ANOTHER ROOM:

Not on silent. IN ANOTHER ROOM. The 10 seconds it takes to go get it is enough to break the autopilot reach.

‚óè CELEBRATION RITUALS:

Created specific ways to celebrate wins. Finished a big project? Victory dance. Completed a hard week? Special coffee. Sounds cheesy, but it works.

THE MOST OVERLOOKED FIXES:

‚óè ADDRESS THE REAL PROBLEM:

Sometimes ""lack of motivation"" is actually depression, burnout, or being in the wrong situation entirely. Don't just optimize productivity if you need therapy or a career change.

‚óè SLEEP LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT:

Motivation crashes when you're exhausted. Dark room, cool temp, same bedtime. Non-negotiable.

‚óè STOP CONSUMING MOTIVATION CONTENT:

Watching motivational videos becomes a substitute for actual action. Limit yourself to one piece of motivational content per week, max.

I hope this helps you. This took a long time to write. Cya

The world was falling apart.



He saw his mom, mauled to death, face melting off as she screeched in her suffering.



He tried.



He really tried to move.



His body held him still, his mind fought as he tries to reach for his mother but his body kept him still, knowing it was no match for what was in front of him.



A Molten.



even being near it was causing him to sweat buckets.



Nevermind the sight in front of him only matters worse.



His mother's eye falling out, melting before it even reached the ground, as her corpse melted, her screeches turning into groans of agony as you saw her skin...start to harden.



her features burning into a bright orange as her melted body pieced itself together, hardening into bits of rock holding her molten self together.



That's it, he was dead.



He was going to turn into one of them.



While he was lost in his thought, his mother, having turned into a Molten, lunged at him, as his skin bubbled for a moment, feeling the heat about to sink into his face, as his mother was blasted into a wall.



""SNAP OUT OF IT!""



A woman shouted, grabbing his hand and running.



He was just dragged away, blankly staring at his mom. Blankly staring at the thing that just tried to kill him.



""Huh...I guess you were right after all, Nov.""



The girl, November, to be exact, ignored his statement, sprinting as she ran out of the city with him.



It was..a few hours later.



He was right outside the abandoned house they found, drinking a beer, looking at the city he grew up in, got bullied at school in, survived his first Incursion in, got his first job in....burning to a melted pile of rubble.



November walked next to him, cracking a can open.



""I'm Sorry about your mother, Jace.""



""Don't be.""



""If it weren't for you, I'd be another one of those...monsters.""



""Still, this is what I went to the tryout for, to protect people.""



""All that training for nothing.""



""About that."" Jace turned to November.



""How did the tryout go.""



""I got in, I'm officially T.D.S cannon fodder."" she chuckled.



""What rank?"" he asked blankly, staring back at the ground.



""Cryomancer, they said I was too skinny to be a Rocketeer.""



""Well, better than not getting in at all I suppose."" he sipped after saying that.



""Yeah...."" She said...hesitating for a bit, before saying.



""...Come with me.""



""The T.D.S headquarters are...the safest place to be now."" she said, looking at him with a worried expression.



""I'd rather try my luck at Cyber City, the rent is expensive as fuck, but they got those new forcefields which apparently stop Cube Portals."" he said, sighing a bit.



""Jace. I know what your father did but you can't keep ignoring the truth."" She muttered, sighing.



he stared at her, before chugging his beer can, going back inside.



she sighed, knowing she struck a cord, as she walked back into the house as well, getting sleep.



It was the next morning.



November left a note next to his bed, as it said.



""You know where to find me if you need to. Take care, please.""



Jace woke up, seeing the note, sighing as he packed the stuff from his panic bag, getting ready to go to cyber city.



He hailed a taxi, it was a hell of a fee to go that far, but after a couple of hours, he arrived.



He paid for a hotel for a couple nights, going out at night to clear his mind.



The rumors weren't wrong, despite the borderline apocalypse destroying the planet, some cities, Like Cyber City, have adapted, and if anything, grown bigger due to everyone flocking to the safety of the city.



He walked into a bar, ordering a drink.



It was empty, buisness clearly wasn't good.



The owner poured him a drink, reading the pained, yet blank face on Jace, as she said. ""Long day?""



He reached for his wallet, paying her, drinking as he said. ""How'd you tell?""



She chuckled at the remark, drying a cup as she said. ""Your not the only person who's been arriving from Harringston.""



""Figured."" he flatly said, as he finished his cup, reaching for his wallet again to pay her for another.



""Ah ah ah."" she raised her finger, gesturing for him to stop.



""Tonight's on me.""



he chuckled, still reaching for his wallet. ""Don't be kidding miss, your only customer here is me, y'need the money more than I do.""



""Another dollar and I'm not pouring you anything big boy."" she smirked, just pouring him a random drink.



He chuckled, deciding to go along with it.



""Besides, I understand.""



He was a little confused, muttering. ""hm?""



""How it is to see your entire life burn in front of your eyes.""



""..-Or in my case how everything turned green and fucking screeched at me.""



he sighed, drinking the drink she poured him.



""I'm sorry Miss.""



""If your sorry, have another."" she chuckled, brushing the serious remark off.



they chatted for awhile, deciding to meet up later the next week.



He arrived at the coffee shop, they had decided to meet up at 2.



She was there, waiting for him.



He walked in, awkwardly waving.



They ordered, then sat down.



""So...how have you been?"" Jace said, kind of awkward, not used to talking to people much, the emotional shock had worn off by now compared to the time he first met her, so he had returned to his awkward, introverted self.



""Good, good, the bar is still not having that much income, but I've started an advertising campaign, so hopefully that'll bring more customers in!""



""That's great! And how's the dog-""



""Ah ah. His name is Lord William, and hes been well, the amputation definitely put him in a bad mood, but I've been helping him work through it.""



She sighed, thinking of her dog, as she said. ""How's moving in been.""



""Been great. Its a little cramped, but the price is manageable, I've even gotten a job at Wendy's to help pay for rent for the next month or so.""



She smiled, relieved he managed to fully settle in. ""I'm glad.""



They continued to talk for a bit, as the drinks arrived.



They enjoyed their coffee, as suddenly, she lost grip of her mug, as it spilled all over her shirt.



""SHIT-""



""Kait are you alright?"" Jace said, getting up and helping wipe her shirt.



she chuckled awkwardly, embarassed at her mishap, as she said. ""YUP-T-thanks-""



""Your welcome."" He chuckled, giving her tissues so she can help with cleaning herself up.



the stains didn't come off, as she said. ""feels so fucking damp-"" she said, waving her arms to try to get the liquid out.



""Maybe you can change at home?"" he remarked.



""I'd rather not, my home's at the outskirts, the shop would be closed by the time I'm back."" she said, sighing.



""Maybe you could find something at my place? Its only two blocks from here."" He told, as she looked down, then just tilted her head, quickly deciding as she nodded, and they headed to his house.



He was in his closet, finding a shirt.



After finding one, he gave it to her, saying. ""Its a tad oversized, but I'm sure it'll work.""



""Thanks-"" she grabbed it, going to change.



He sat at the TV, turning on a streaming service.



She walked out, it most DEFINITELY was oversized, but, certainly better than a soaked shirt.



""Fits well enough-thank you Jace."" She said, tucking the large shirt into her pants.



""No problem!"" He said, as he turned on a movie.



she leaned over to look at his tv, saying. ""What'cha watching?""



""Avengers Doomsday, the one that just came out this sunday, wanna watch?""



She wasn't expecting the invitation, but decided she had nothing better to do, as she simply said. ""sure!""



As she sat down on the couch, he went to pop some popcorn in the microwave.



They had fun for the rest of the night, watching a couple extra movies.



That wouldn't be the last time they met.



They continued to meet for a while, and soon decided to start dating.



It was 7 months later, they were walking down the street, going to a resturaunt they'd been wanting to go together.



""So, your trying to tell me, he puked on you, THEN he asked for his money back?"" Jace said in disbelief.



Kait giggled, saying ""YEAH! And I got arrested for not doing so, thank fucking christ the officer had some sense once we were both at the station.""



Jace shook his head, saying. ""Unbelivable, fucking unbelivable, at least your record is still clean?"" 



Kait nodded, chuckling. ""Yup, its still clean.""



""Good. It better be or I'm going to maul those fucking officers to death.""



He saw the resturaunt, huh, it did look as fancy as they said, as he turned back to her, he realized.



Her neck was squirting blood out, missing its head.



Where...was her head?



he saw it..roll to his feet.



A zombie tore her body out of his grasp, screeching as it feasted on it, straddling her corpse and eating every bit of meat the corpse offered.



No.....



Not again.



Not this time.



Not this..fucking bullshit.



His life had just gotten better...and..this?



This is what he gets?



His eyes locked onto the Zombie, snarling and feasting on her.



""MOTHERFUCKER!"" he screeched, tackling the zombie and beating it down, smashing his skull it until it didn't respond.



He kept crushing its head in, even after it died, crying.



Another.



Another person he so deeply cared for, taken away.



All because of him.



All because of Him.



he heard another zombie falling down, landing right next to him.



Then another.



Then another.



He looked up.



Was it...raining zombies?



One was falling right at him, as he managed to dodge out of the way.



He punched his way past 2 of them, running for his life as they kept falling onto the street and everywhere around him.



That's how they got past the forcefield.



The forcefield never had a roof.



He ran for his life, dashing for a door.



He looked behind, seeing the zombies chasing after him, oblivious to who he was in front of.



He bumped into it.



A huge, huge...animal.



8..no...9 feet tall.



Huge metal spikes on his wrists.



Was that...a Boss?



He desperately tried to run, but the boss kicked him to the ground, as he screamed, feeling his ribs shattering, as the boss slowly walked towards him, about to crush him into the ground..



Rockets crushed into the boss's flesh, blasting him and the zombies nearby away.



They'd arrived.



The Rocketeer on the roof jumped down, giving a hand for Jace to help him get up.



""Don't worry lad, you'll be just fine.""



A soldier radioed him, saying. ""The Path Generator can't use the U Turn configuration sir.""



""Can we crossroad it?"" he radioed back.



""No sir, the city is too dense for that, we're going to have to manually generate a path."" another soldier replied.



""Alright, call for backup from HQ, I've got civilians to bring back, get Snipers to cover me."" He radioed back to the soldiers.



""Yes sir, over and out.""



The Rocketeer turned to Jace, saying. ""We're gonna get you out, alright? Just lean on my shoulder."" He said, seeing Jace weakening from his injuries.



It had been 5 minutes, the Rocketeer firing his launcher to get rid of the zombies chasing the two of them, as the helicopter was lowering down for them, blasting the enemies away.



Jace was almost unconscious, as the Rocketeer, still blasting the zombies away, just kept talking, trying to keep him awake.



""C'mon, we're almost there, what's your name?"" He blankly asked, just trying to create conversation to keep him awake.



""I'mm-Jacee.."" Jace stutteringly said, his internal bleeding slowly causing him to black out.



""Good, great name, I'm Ronan, we're almost there hang on-""



He blasted a zombie holding onto his foot, grabbing onto the rope of the pursuit, screaming at the pilots to tell them to fly away.



After successfully flying away, he climbed the rope and pulled Jace onto the helicopter, patching him up.



""We're going to get you to the hospital at HQ, they've got some crazy shit there, it'll patch you up in no time.""



Jace nodded, still semi-asleep.



Jace soon woke up, about half an hour later, as they had arrived.





T.D.S Headquarters.



the most advanced Megastructure on the planet.



An entire city capable of moving, all being one large machine.



He limped off the helicopter, as Ronan was escorting him to the hospital.



As they arrived at the hospital, as Jace bumped someone's shoulder, as he looked back at the person..only to see a familiar face looking back at him.



""........November?""

The Hustle Trap is a story of ambition, righteousness, and self-deception, revealing how chasing impact can quietly destroy you when the hustle becomes your identity.  
  
A raw, fictionalized memoir about an ambitious individual who attempts to reform a broken system through entrepreneurship.

Chapter 1 - The Opportunity.

The chart looked like a rocket launch.

Overdose deaths ‚Äî opioids, heroin, synthetic fentanyl ‚Äî climbing year after year. A clean but brutal curve. The kind that doesn't go back down.

""There's a new epidemic hitting the United States,"" the news anchor said. ""In 2015 alone, over 52,400 Americans died from opioid overdoses. Experts say it's only getting worse.""

Jared paused the clip. He'd seen graphs like this before. But not like this.

He was a pharmacist. He taught pharmacy law at night. He understood how broken things were ‚Äî but still, this hit him in the gut.

*Jesus*, he thought.¬†*This is insane.*

People were dying quietly. Alone. In shame. Not just because they were addicted, but because the system demanded they suffer for it. If you wanted Narcan ‚Äî the one drug that could save your life mid-overdose ‚Äî you needed a prescription. Which meant walking into a clinic and saying something insane like:

""Hey doc, I'm addicted to putting the needle in my arm. Can I get a drug that'll keep me from dying next time?""

Most people wouldn't say that. Most families didn't even know what Narcan was. And if they did ‚Äî were they even allowed to give it to someone else?

He knew the legal answer. He taught the legal answer. It didn't make it feel any less stupid.

*The system didn't just fail people. It punished them.*

Jared was tired. Not just of the job. Of Seattle. Of the rain. Of the isolation.

He'd lived there three years and still felt like an outsider. It was the kind of city where people smiled but didn't invite you in. Coffee shops filled with headphones and overpriced minimalism. Conversations that ended in ""we should grab a drink sometime,"" but never did.

He wanted out.

And maybe ‚Äî just maybe ‚Äî he'd found a way.

He'd applied for a global public policy role at one of the top pharmaceutical companies in the world. It was his dream job. The kind of position that could let him fix the system from the inside ‚Äî work on international drug access, push policy, bring meds into underserved markets. Use corporate power for actual good.

They flew him out. First class. Final three candidates.

He wore an $800 suit to the interview ‚Äî which was hilarious, because Jared was a proud cheap-ass who hadn't spent more than $100 on anything in years. But this was different. This was¬†*everything*.

What he lacked in pedigree, he made up for in obsession. For months, he'd been spending nights at the library ‚Äî reading books on corporate strategy, patent law, global access programs. He even built a slide deck explaining how international medication patents could be restructured for developing nations.

He had no MBA. No mentors. No experience in policy or business.

Just a pharmacist with a fire under him.

He met John on the flight home.

They were seated next to each other, two strangers headed back to the same rainy city. John looked over and made a comment about Jared's suit ‚Äî said he looked overdressed for a tech conference. Jared smiled and told him the truth: he was coming back from an interview.

That was all it took.

They talked the whole flight.

About everything and nothing. Why America felt broken. Why Seattle felt lonely. Why healthcare punished the people it was supposed to protect. John wasn't flashy. Didn't talk credentials. Just asked great questions. Listened with intent. He felt more human than anyone Jared had met in months.

At one point, Jared confessed he wanted to get into politics one day. It slipped out ‚Äî something he normally wouldn't say to anyone.

John just nodded.

When they landed, he said, ""Let's stay in touch.""

Jared didn't believe him. Seattle had a way of making even kindness feel performative.

But two days later, his phone rang.

""There's a guy I know who wants to pitch me his startup,"" John said. ""Thought it might be fun for you to sit in.""

Jared was curious.

They met at a Starbucks. The founder showed them a small hardware device ‚Äî a panic button for women walking home alone. It would connect to an app, alert someone if they felt unsafe.

The pitch wasn't great. The guy was nervous. The idea felt half-baked. But Jared couldn't stop watching John.

He was calm. Focused. Watching the¬†*person*, not just the product.

Later, Jared would learn the word for what John was: an angel investor. A man who could change someone's life with one check. Jared hadn't known that on the plane. But it made sense.

John didn't lead with power. He led with interest.

Over a few coffees, John gave Jared something he hadn't heard from anyone else.

""Don't waste your life pushing paper in a tower,"" he said. ""And don't go into politics. I did that for years ‚Äî it's mostly theater. You get beat up in public and can't actually fix anything.""

What mattered, John said, was solving a¬†*real*¬†problem.

Not writing a white paper.

Not debating on a panel.

Actually fixing something broken.

That stuck with Jared.

A week later, the pharma company called.

He didn't get the job.

And for the first time, instead of feeling crushed...

He felt free.

He didn't know what was next. But for the first time in a long time, he was excited to figure it out.",0,1752021978.0,DestructiveReaders,0,0.5,False

Long story short we broke up because he came back from his home country (FAR away), said he doesn‚Äôt see a future with me, and wants to move back. We tried to make it work for a year to see if someone could compromise, but we broke up in Jan.

We were seeing each other on and off for a few months after this, but went full no contact 3 months ago. I accidentally broke no contact because of that stupid disappearing messages feature on insta. 

We planned on meeting for a coffee as things were quite heated the last time we spoke. But we got into an argument over the phone and decided to cancel. 

He‚Äôs gonna check in with me if I want to see him to say goodbye. On one hand I feel like he doesn‚Äôt deserve to see me one last time- he absolutely shattered my heart last year and became a cold, distant person. Also if I see him I‚Äôll cry for a week and also know the date he‚Äôll be gone- so I‚Äôm guaranteeing myself a period of sadness.

However there once was so much love between us, we still care about each other and he has sincerely apologised for all of his behaviour over and over again. He‚Äôs not a bad man, just a bad partner.

So if I don‚Äôt meet up, I likely will never see him again and that‚Äôs also terrifying because I might regret it forever.

Grab a drink, and get comfy cause this is a long one. 

Notice: Names have been changed. 

I (25F) and ""James"" (25M) have been together for 8 years. We have a 5 year old daughter, we live together, we also have lots of pets. We have had our fights, of course, along with many ups and downs, but we have always been able to talk things out and work on the problem.. so I thought. 

A little backstory into our relationship.

We met in high school. He was a new kid coming in halfway thro the year when the new semester had started. I noticed him and asked if he wanted to be my partner for the class. He said yes. 

When class finished, I invited him to where my friends and I sat for lunch. I didn't make him feel obligated at all and went on my way. To my surprise, he actually showed up. From there, it started our friendship that then led to our relationship a few weeks later. We have been together ever since, well.. minus a small brake we took in the middle because of him.. but we'll get to that. 

Our relationship in the beginning (both 17 at the time) was your normal teenage love. We never wanted to be apart, texting or snapchating all the time, and of course, lots of intimacy.

A year and a half later, and it's time for prom, I was so excited to go. I had always heard about the memories you make and seen all the magic of it in moives. Cliche, I know, but I was a teenager.

Anyway.. I never got to go to prom. 
That year leading up to prom, I didn't pick up on all the little comments james would make. For example, if I said I was going anywhere, he would instantly start making comments about me cheating. 

The comments were always about me cheating on him or flirting with other people. I would just reassure him and move on. Prom got closer, and the comments apped up.. so much so that I just decided not to go to prom cause it would be easier than fighting. I regret that to this day. 

Adding to the situation, we also lived together at the time.. I had to move out of my moms place at 16 to get away from a toxic environment.. I moved in with my dad. By late 17 close to my 18th birthday, I had moved out with james, and we were now living together. 

We graduated, and even that was ruined by the cheating comments. You dont get to pick where you sit during the graduation ceremony, and I sat in between two guys during the ceremony. By the end, i could barely keep a smile on my face for pictures being so defeated. And in the rush of just trying to leave, i didn't get a picture with my great grandmother, another thing i regret to this day. 

In 2018/2019, we moved in with my dad. A couple of months later, we took a break. It was my decision to take the break after finding out he had invaded my privacy by reading my journal. Also, there were some obvious insecurity issues but mostly for the privacy issue. 

It just crossed a line for me. That night, he had moved back in with his mom, and I stayed living with my dad. We were separated for a couple of months where we would see each other often to catch up or have adult time. But we stayed separated. 

During that time, I was going through a lot of self discovery, I was in college and had a full-time job. I did sleep with a couple of people during this time, and he knew that. It never stopped him from wanting me to get back together with him, but it would be thrown back in my face for a couple of years after, during almost every fight. 

When I did make up my mind about wanting to get back with him, I invited him over for the night and told him how i was feeling but never made anything official. At the time, i had moved out of my dads and into an apartment with a roommate. Important in a minute. 

The next morning he had to work and I didn't.. I had gotten a message from an old someone, and they wanted to meet up for coffee. Still unsure about james.. I went. One thing led to another, and the next thing i know, we were at his place, and you know what happens from there. 

He had gotten off work, returned back to the apartment, and I wasn't back yet.. he, of course, called, and I made a lie and said I'd be back soon. He took it apon himself to go ask my roommate where I really was, she of course told him the truth. 

Before I had made it back to the apartment, the two of them had slept together, but I wouldn't find this out tell a year later, when I was 4 months pregnant.. 

I just want to say we were obviously toxic to each other but didn't want to let the other person go. 

We got back together.. I continued school and work, and he kept working, and we still lived with the roommate.. about a year-ish later, I wanted a baby.. and in that very moment, I know I was making the right decision to have a baby with this man. Ignoring everything that we had ever been through because we were in a good place. Not financially stable at all but in a great place mentally in our relationship.

I became pregnant very fast and started looking for apartments right away. I also dropped out of school and started working as much as possible. About 3 months later, I'd found a place, and we both moved in. Things are going great. 

A month later, I'm sitting at work, and my phone rings. It's my roommates ex.. he wants to tell me about her and james sleeping together. I play it off like i already knew that, trying not to let my pregnancy hormones get the best of me. I hang up and sit there for what's left of my break and go back to work. 

I can't say much about it. It would be extremely hypocritical of me, but i do bring it up to james later that night telling him i know about what happened that night. I wasn't mad but just disappointed a bit. Why didn't he tell me? I told him about everyone during our separation. I did lie that day, but the truth did come out, and I didn't try to gaslight him to think it didn't. I just told him the truth, and he stayed. Now i know why. 

We moved on, our baby was on the way, and we had other things to worry about.

I was still working as much as I could at the time, and James was now unemployed. It didn't bug me. He was looking for work, and I was making enough to support us. 

A couple of months later and covid hits. Im now unemployed, 7 months pregnant and stressed. I have no choice but to take my maternity early, and he takes out the cerb benefits, if your canadian, you know what those are. 

Our baby girl comes, and she is healthy. We go home and spend the next 10 months raising our daughter. We had little fights here and there about small things, but we always talked it though and figured it out.

Suddenly, james starts talking about moving to where his parents are located. He gave me an opinion in the beginning about the move, I didn't want to. I was raised there, and all my family lived there or close too. He slowly stopped asking and just started telling me, ""im moving with or without, and im taking our daughter,"" This went on until i caved and agreed to move.

We moved before her first birthday, and i had left everything behind in hopes that this was the right decision. 

A year later and we moved into a house on the lake. Everything was great, our daughter was happy, we were happy. We had found a great home to rent, we had got a new car, everything was just amazing and going well. 

He got a great job with a mine and was gone for 2 weeks out of the month working. Im still unemployed raising our daughter. I started a small business about 2 years ago that was going pretty well, and I was making my income that way.

A year later.. he wants to take a break to work on himself but still wants to live together because of his job and daughter. As much as it hurt, we tried. Staying distant didn't work, and the break ended a couple of days later. 

From there, things were never the same. On the surface, everything was fine, but our bedroom life took a turn when our daughter arrived, and it was starting to take a toll. We stopped talking to each other, stopped being intimate in the way it really mattered, and just grew distant for a while. 

This didn't help the coming months. We fought about everything all the time. Constantly going in circles, battling, to be right. Somehow, dispirit everything, we managed to talk and grew closer and more intimate. But it was just never enough. 

He always wanted more, more attention, more love, more intimacy, just more. Everything i did just wasn't enough for a while. I would make him happy for a moment, but 10 minutes later, we would be fighting. 

Fast forward to last night. 
My daughter asked if she could let the dogs out, I said yes. My male dog needs to be clipped to leash. As my daughter went to open the door and grab the clip, my male ran by her out the door. 

I rushed to the door to go chase him, but my daughter was standing in the doorway. Frantically, I asked her to move and ran out the door. Im not sure if I accidentally in my panic hit her with the door or she was just upset, but after running out and catching my male, I could hear crying. 

I put my dog on his clip and went back inside. A couple minutes later, james comes out of the bedroom saying we need to talk. Still Frantic, I ask about what. He says our daughter came in the room saying I hit her and she wants him to yell at me. 

We go to talk in the room away from our daughter. He starts by asking what happened, and I tell him exactly what happened. We sit for a second, and he says, ""This can't be happening. Our daughter wanted to watch me yell at you."" Hurt and teary over the situation, I sat there. He started to talk again, ""Do we need to split up, I'm over the fighting. It feels like our daughter is trying to turn us against each other.""  Fighting tears, I said no.  

I couldn't even remember the last time we had fought in front of her. Our relationship had been going well, our bedroom life was returning  and we were getting more intimate.

We talked for 2 hours, deciding to work on things one last time... but I can't help but think it might have been the wrong decision. A couple of things were said that I just can't get off my mind. 

At the end of talking, we were cuddling, and james said ""I've thought about cheating on you to get you to break up with me, because I know you love me to much to do it."" Stunned, I laid still. 

A minute later, I got up and went to the washroom to collect myself. Instead of breaking up and hurting my feelings, he would break my trust in anyone, forever.. 

Today, he left for work.. a couple hours later, he asked me if I could do his whmis for him. I said yes and started when I got back home. I opened my laptop and went to his google account to do the training.

As I went to search for a whmis course on google, the menu popped down, and I could see all his recent search history.. he had searched ""dating apps,"" ""free dating sites,"" and ""dating sites for(insert our area),"" and ""snapchat."" He doesn't have snapchat..

I spiraled.. and I know I shouldn't have, but I checked the rest of his search history. He searched for apartments in the area, dating sites, and corn sites. I dont mind that he goes on the corn sites at all. I do it from time to time. 

What I do care about is the times he was on it. Right after our talk yesterday, he had searched for a corn site. He also searched them in the mornings after we would get up and get dressed or before I got back from the washroom in the morning. 

We sleep nude together in the same bed.. there is no reason for him to look at corn sites when I'm lying right next to him nude. I think what just makes it all worse is that we had spicy sleep the night of our talk. So that means we talked for 2 hours, almost broke up, decided to work on things.. and when I left the room, he searched corn.. then, later that night, initiated intimacy..

These searches started in the last couple of days. The corn was there, but the dating site and apps weren't. I dont understand how things just changed so fast from okay to bad. 

So now I sit here writing this contemplating my life. 

Im a unemployed, 2 time college drop out, broke, stay at home mom, that has no family support, no car, and no true friends. 

I can't get a job, I have no one to watch my daughter during the 2 weeks, james is gone to work. She can't go to daycare cause there is a 3 year waitlist in my area. I can't go back to school because I owe money on my student loans and can't get assistance tell it's paid. I've looked for remote work with no luck, and my small business unfortunately took a plunge last December. 

For a while, I was constantly told by james that I needed to get a job and 2 incomes were better than one. Constantly reminded he pays for everything, and nothing is in my name. 

But this couldn't be farther from the truth. The little bit of income I do make pays for the house insurance, wifi, our daughters college fund, and all the food in the house. Plus, I have to pay my other bills, credit cards, and subscriptions. Im very fortunate to be on a family phone plan with my grandparents. I wouldn't be able to afford a phone bill. 

All day, I have been racking my brain about what to do. Crying off and on. Maybe ask james if he could get me a job with his company. Just work the opposite rotation, and we would hardly have to see each other, and our daughter would always have a parent around.

1lv595g,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1lv595g/296_days_giving_up_caffeine/,"296 days, giving up caffeine","Not the semester start I had hoped for. After my sleep schedule was royally fucked up for the past week or so, I haven‚Äôt studied as much as I‚Äôd like.

Still. It‚Äôs early.

I told my partner I would quit caffeine this semester. He laughed. Not without reason, it has been comical the amount of times I say I‚Äôm quitting caffeine then the next morning I‚Äôm drinking a cup of coffee (familiar right?). So. I said *‚Äùyou want to bet?‚Äù*. Now we have a $5 deal and I refuse to cave. Less for the money, more for the pride of it.

Just trying to find a rhythm again I suppose. I want to do well. I feel the anxiety crawling back up my neck and the hopelessness trickling down my limbs. I‚Äôm feeling scared and heavy. But nothing unmanageable. 

And that‚Äôs the biggest thing - whether it is manageable or not. I‚Äôve realised anxiety will always be a part of my life (thankyou mum and dad), but whether I break or not under the weight of it is the most important thing. Whether I let it change my behaviour.

Endure the feeling. Let it pass. Slowly it resides. I‚Äôm playing the long game.

I have to protect myself from the hellhole I was in before.

That‚Äôs all today folks.

Grab a drink, and get comfy cause this is a long one. 

Notice: Names have been changed. 

I (25F) and ""James"" (25M) have been together for 8 years. We have a 5 year old daughter, we live together, we also have lots of pets. We have had our fights, of course, along with many ups and downs, but we have always been able to talk things out and work on the problem.. so I thought. 

A little backstory into our relationship.

We met in high school. He was a new kid coming in halfway thro the year when the new semester had started. I noticed him and asked if he wanted to be my partner for the class. He said yes. 

When class finished, I invited him to where my friends and I sat for lunch. I didn't make him feel obligated at all and went on my way. To my surprise, he actually showed up. From there, it started our friendship that then led to our relationship a few weeks later. We have been together ever since, well.. minus a small brake we took in the middle because of him.. but we'll get to that. 

Our relationship in the beginning (both 17 at the time) was your normal teenage love. We never wanted to be apart, texting or snapchating all the time, and of course, lots of intimacy.

A year and a half later, and it's time for prom, I was so excited to go. I had always heard about the memories you make and seen all the magic of it in moives. Cliche, I know, but I was a teenager.

Anyway.. I never got to go to prom. 
That year leading up to prom, I didn't pick up on all the little comments james would make. For example, if I said I was going anywhere, he would instantly start making comments about me cheating. 

The comments were always about me cheating on him or flirting with other people. I would just reassure him and move on. Prom got closer, and the comments apped up.. so much so that I just decided not to go to prom cause it would be easier than fighting. I regret that to this day. 

Adding to the situation, we also lived together at the time.. I had to move out of my moms place at 16 to get away from a toxic environment.. I moved in with my dad. By late 17 close to my 18th birthday, I had moved out with james, and we were now living together. 

We graduated, and even that was ruined by the cheating comments. You dont get to pick where you sit during the graduation ceremony, and I sat in between two guys during the ceremony. By the end, i could barely keep a smile on my face for pictures being so defeated. And in the rush of just trying to leave, i didn't get a picture with my great grandmother, another thing i regret to this day. 

In 2018/2019, we moved in with my dad. A couple of months later, we took a break. It was my decision to take the break after finding out he had invaded my privacy by reading my journal. Also, there were some obvious insecurity issues but mostly for the privacy issue. 

It just crossed a line for me. That night, he had moved back in with his mom, and I stayed living with my dad. We were separated for a couple of months where we would see each other often to catch up or have adult time. But we stayed separated. 

During that time, I was going through a lot of self discovery, I was in college and had a full-time job. I did sleep with a couple of people during this time, and he knew that. It never stopped him from wanting me to get back together with him, but it would be thrown back in my face for a couple of years after, during almost every fight. 

When I did make up my mind about wanting to get back with him, I invited him over for the night and told him how i was feeling but never made anything official. At the time, i had moved out of my dads and into an apartment with a roommate. Important in a minute. 

The next morning he had to work and I didn't.. I had gotten a message from an old someone, and they wanted to meet up for coffee. Still unsure about james.. I went. One thing led to another, and the next thing i know, we were at his place, and you know what happens from there. 

He had gotten off work, returned back to the apartment, and I wasn't back yet.. he, of course, called, and I made a lie and said I'd be back soon. He took it apon himself to go ask my roommate where I really was, she of course told him the truth. 

Before I had made it back to the apartment, the two of them had slept together, but I wouldn't find this out tell a year later, when I was 4 months pregnant.. 

I just want to say we were obviously toxic to each other but didn't want to let the other person go. 

We got back together.. I continued school and work, and he kept working, and we still lived with the roommate.. about a year-ish later, I wanted a baby.. and in that very moment, I know I was making the right decision to have a baby with this man. Ignoring everything that we had ever been through because we were in a good place. Not financially stable at all but in a great place mentally in our relationship.

I became pregnant very fast and started looking for apartments right away. I also dropped out of school and started working as much as possible. About 3 months later, I'd found a place, and we both moved in. Things are going great. 

A month later, I'm sitting at work, and my phone rings. It's my roommates ex.. he wants to tell me about her and james sleeping together. I play it off like i already knew that, trying not to let my pregnancy hormones get the best of me. I hang up and sit there for what's left of my break and go back to work. 

I can't say much about it. It would be extremely hypocritical of me, but i do bring it up to james later that night telling him i know about what happened that night. I wasn't mad but just disappointed a bit. Why didn't he tell me? I told him about everyone during our separation. I did lie that day, but the truth did come out, and I didn't try to gaslight him to think it didn't. I just told him the truth, and he stayed. Now i know why. 

We moved on, our baby was on the way, and we had other things to worry about.

I was still working as much as I could at the time, and James was now unemployed. It didn't bug me. He was looking for work, and I was making enough to support us. 

A couple of months later and covid hits. Im now unemployed, 7 months pregnant and stressed. I have no choice but to take my maternity early, and he takes out the cerb benefits, if your canadian, you know what those are. 

Our baby girl comes, and she is healthy. We go home and spend the next 10 months raising our daughter. We had little fights here and there about small things, but we always talked it though and figured it out.

Suddenly, james starts talking about moving to where his parents are located. He gave me an opinion in the beginning about the move, I didn't want to. I was raised there, and all my family lived there or close too. He slowly stopped asking and just started telling me, ""im moving with or without, and im taking our daughter,"" This went on until i caved and agreed to move.

We moved before her first birthday, and i had left everything behind in hopes that this was the right decision. 

A year later and we moved into a house on the lake. Everything was great, our daughter was happy, we were happy. We had found a great home to rent, we had got a new car, everything was just amazing and going well. 

He got a great job with a mine and was gone for 2 weeks out of the month working. Im still unemployed raising our daughter. I started a small business about 2 years ago that was going pretty well, and I was making my income that way.

A year later.. he wants to take a break to work on himself but still wants to live together because of his job and daughter. As much as it hurt, we tried. Staying distant didn't work, and the break ended a couple of days later. 

From there, things were never the same. On the surface, everything was fine, but our bedroom life took a turn when our daughter arrived, and it was starting to take a toll. We stopped talking to each other, stopped being intimate in the way it really mattered, and just grew distant for a while. 

This didn't help the coming months. We fought about everything all the time. Constantly going in circles, battling, to be right. Somehow, dispirit everything, we managed to talk and grew closer and more intimate. But it was just never enough. 

He always wanted more, more attention, more love, more intimacy, just more. Everything i did just wasn't enough for a while. I would make him happy for a moment, but 10 minutes later, we would be fighting. 

Fast forward to last night. 
My daughter asked if she could let the dogs out, I said yes. My male dog needs to be clipped to leash. As my daughter went to open the door and grab the clip, my male ran by her out the door. 

I rushed to the door to go chase him, but my daughter was standing in the doorway. Frantically, I asked her to move and ran out the door. Im not sure if I accidentally in my panic hit her with the door or she was just upset, but after running out and catching my male, I could hear crying. 

I put my dog on his clip and went back inside. A couple minutes later, james comes out of the bedroom saying we need to talk. Still Frantic, I ask about what. He says our daughter came in the room saying I hit her and she wants him to yell at me. 

We go to talk in the room away from our daughter. He starts by asking what happened, and I tell him exactly what happened. We sit for a second, and he says, ""This can't be happening. Our daughter wanted to watch me yell at you."" Hurt and teary over the situation, I sat there. He started to talk again, ""Do we need to split up, I'm over the fighting. It feels like our daughter is trying to turn us against each other.""  Fighting tears, I said no.  

I couldn't even remember the last time we had fought in front of her. Our relationship had been going well, our bedroom life was returning  and we were getting more intimate.

We talked for 2 hours, deciding to work on things one last time... but I can't help but think it might have been the wrong decision. A couple of things were said that I just can't get off my mind. 

At the end of talking, we were cuddling, and james said ""I've thought about cheating on you to get you to break up with me, because I know you love me to much to do it."" Stunned, I laid still. 

A minute later, I got up and went to the washroom to collect myself. Instead of breaking up and hurting my feelings, he would break my trust in anyone, forever.. 

Today, he left for work.. a couple hours later, he asked me if I could do his whmis for him. I said yes and started when I got back home. I opened my laptop and went to his google account to do the training.

As I went to search for a whmis course on google, the menu popped down, and I could see all his recent search history.. he had searched ""dating apps,"" ""free dating sites,"" and ""dating sites for(insert our area),"" and ""snapchat."" He doesn't have snapchat..

I spiraled.. and I know I shouldn't have, but I checked the rest of his search history. He searched for apartments in the area, dating sites, and corn sites. I dont mind that he goes on the corn sites at all. I do it from time to time. 

What I do care about is the times he was on it. Right after our talk yesterday, he had searched for a corn site. He also searched them in the mornings after we would get up and get dressed or before I got back from the washroom in the morning. 

We sleep nude together in the same bed.. there is no reason for him to look at corn sites when I'm lying right next to him nude. I think what just makes it all worse is that we had spicy sleep the night of our talk. So that means we talked for 2 hours, almost broke up, decided to work on things.. and when I left the room, he searched corn.. then, later that night, initiated intimacy..

These searches started in the last couple of days. The corn was there, but the dating site and apps weren't. I dont understand how things just changed so fast from okay to bad. 

So now I sit here writing this contemplating my life. 

Im a unemployed, 2 time college drop out, broke, stay at home mom, that has no family support, no car, and no true friends. 

I can't get a job, I have no one to watch my daughter during the 2 weeks, james is gone to work. She can't go to daycare cause there is a 3 year waitlist in my area. I can't go back to school because I owe money on my student loans and can't get assistance tell it's paid. I've looked for remote work with no luck, and my small business unfortunately took a plunge last December. 

For a while, I was constantly told by james that I needed to get a job and 2 incomes were better than one. Constantly reminded he pays for everything, and nothing is in my name. 

But this couldn't be farther from the truth. The little bit of income I do make pays for the house insurance, wifi, our daughters college fund, and all the food in the house. Plus, I have to pay my other bills, credit cards, and subscriptions. Im very fortunate to be on a family phone plan with my grandparents. I wouldn't be able to afford a phone bill. 

All day, I have been racking my brain about what to do. Crying off and on. Maybe ask james if he could get me a job with his company. Just work the opposite rotation, and we would hardly have to see each other, and our daughter would always have a parent around. It would also give me the chance to make some money and get on my feet. 

Or just keep things the way they are and work on the relationship. Stick to being a stay at home mom with a small business. 

I dont know what to do anymore. Im even debating starting my own corn channel (strictly anonymous) to maybe make more money.. James has always told me he'd be okay with it.. So maybe that's what I do. Make corn and try to save money.. 

Im lost. I need help. I need advice. If you have read all of this, thank you. Im unsure if I'll update or if this will reach the right people, but it was nice to get this off my chest. Even tho I'm still spiraling, it helped.

We have one child and want another but we cannot figure out how to afford it.

We do spend some money on restaurants, coffee shops, and entertainment, but all in all our ‚Äúfun‚Äù budget is such a small percent of our income. Though definitely happy to cut if needed. Does anything stand out as disproportionate?

I can never get the perfect amount of sugar, milk, and espresso. 

For context, I use a moka pot to make the coffee, a glass measuring cup to make the espumita (I use turbinado sugar because I haven't been able to find demerara sugar), and a metal creamer cup. I don't have a hard time with the coffee and sugar, because I know how to make a normal cafecito, but I have a hard time with the milk. I let the milk heat up, then use a frother wand to foam the milk up. I don't really measure how long it takes, but every time I put the frother in it rises to close to the top of the creamer cup almost immediately. Once the coffee and milk are done, I fill my espresso cups about a third of the way to the top with the milk foam, then add the coffee with espumita until it is full. 

Does anyone see any glaring errors in my method that's preventing me from making the best cortadito? The ones I have had at the Cuban restaurant near me are almost dessert-like in my opinion because they are so good, and I would love to be able to recreate them.

I remember being a little girl so excited to ‚Äògrow up‚Äô and date. When my older sister (23F) started High school it all happened right away for her, dates, prom, boy drama, I couldn‚Äôt wait for my turn. By my freshman year of HS, the only experience I had was a first kiss with a boy who would two years later be put away for gr*pe, and a short middle school ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô with a boy who told me he wanted a break, then was humiliated in the cafeteria when another girl loudly confessed that THEY in fact were now dating. Cool whatever, that same boy our freshman year started real dating one of my friends, and they would make out all of lunch period right next to me. Awesome right? A few more scenarios like this played out the rest of high school, leading to my only type of relationship i‚Äôve ever had the summer before college, a 3 month situationship that i was in love with. 

Some context about me, I was a late bloomer. Very ugly duckling until I was 18. I had a breast reduction, lost weight, and died my hair blonde. It was the first time I felt like I was truly beautiful, I told myself now that I was pretty it had to be just around the corner. IT WAS NOT! If anything I felt more disgusted with myself. the only attention I got was physical, and i‚Äôm the type that needs to know you for a bit before I can have a physical relationship. I remember being at a party and laying it on this one guy pretty heavy. I had a crush on him for a while and knew this was my chance to take things further. It was going well, he was reciprocating my flirty vibes, but then leaned in and whispered ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre not gonna hangout, but wanna have sex tonight?‚Äô Huh? totally threw me off, and i backed off immediately. College had to be my time I thought. WRONG.

I went to a smaller college pretty far from my state, and knew no one. It was my fresh start to be someone new, someone lovable. Issues arose pretty quick however, due to my stunning roommate. We were really close, and because of this we decided to draw a line in the sand. Anyone who‚Äôs been involved with her, I won‚Äôt go for and vice versa. You can have her or me, not both. We lived in the same small space so we thought it was a good plan. The first week of classes was‚Ä¶interesting. As stated before I can‚Äôt really jump into bed with a stranger, no hate on anyone else‚Äôs choices at all, it‚Äôs just not for me. My roommate (19F) was really loving and physical right away which i admired about her. There were a couple times I turned down a one night stand and they immediately jump ship to her. Cool, you made your choice. I finished school and moved to a big city in the midwest, downloaded all the apps and ready to put myself out there. I went on a few dates, but they were all horror stories. I knew all first dates are a little awkward, but the one that scared me away for good showed up to our coffee date with a black eye, boating about how he beat up his brother the night before, and asked if i wanted to see his mugshot. Classy I know.

I was always the other woman, metaphorically. There‚Äôs an invisible woman i was in competition with. Anyone I like liked someone else more, and my pride wouldn‚Äôt let me be the second choice, so I‚Äôd take myself out of the equation. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm Ugly. Im driven, have my own apartment and a job. I‚Äôm creative and passionate, I have hobbies, I‚Äôm active, and i‚Äôm lonely. I have such an amazing mom and friend group that are always there for me, but sometimes I just want to cry to The Notebook. I‚Äôm sure someone relates to the feeling of missing that romantic connection. I don‚Äôt want to settle for someone, it‚Äôs not fair to them or me. If my journey in this life is be single than i‚Äôll overcome, i‚Äôm tough. 

Any advice reddit? I know I‚Äôm not perfect, and I don‚Äôt want to be a victim. How can I find someone for me?

Vanilla Cafe: truly smells to me like the air in a coffee shop. I think what is giving me the vibe is the trifecta of vanilla,hazelnut, and coffee. A delight to my nose probably my favorite out of the bunch. 

Rich Espresso: straight Espresso lawl. Literally stick your nose into a cup of basic coffee and bam that is the smell. 

Midnight Addiction: i didn't smell coffee. If it is there it must be a base note I'm not getting.

Espresso Martini 1 wick: a coffee with sweetener. Didn't get much liquor but maybe I don't know what to look for because I have never had or smelled one in my life lol.

Freshly brewed coffee 3 wick: really does smell like you are near brewing coffee. I don't think it is as sweet as the Espresso Martini but it is rich and creamy.

Over 8 years, I lost 250lbs, doing high protein and low carb, I was even in wrestling school/gigs, and just enjoying everything.

Then in 2023, I ran into back problems, found out I have mild arthritis in my spine, had to do PT, after PT I had 2 cancer scares, so my 2023-late 2024 everything was a mess, and I gained 40lbs back.

I started keto/fasting in October last year and dropped 25lbs in 6 weeks, then holidays came and it was also my birthday in December, so I took a break till January 2025. I gained some back again, but I was determined to get at things again till my doctor's apt (which is a week away)

I kept hopping back and forth on the scale not knowing why I couldn't get under the 240 mark, thanks to you all I was able to get over that mark, telling me I wasn't eating enough fat, so I don't eat chicken as much as I used to I am now eating more pork/beef and such.

So finally today I am down to 226 from 245 in the last 6 or so weeks!

I also managed to drop 6% body fat!

So I am here to say THANK YOU r/keto community, for all your help!

I am going to talk to my doctor next week about staying on keto for the rest of the year, and hopefully be at my goal weight come 2026!

I've been on my health journey since 2015, and I am finally seeing a clear end to losing all this weight naturally. It hasn't been easy, but even with my back problems I gotta live with, I am determined to finish what I started.

So again, thank you to all of you who have posted/commented and helped me along this journey. I greatly appreciate all of you!

I used to wear 6x plus sized clothes, now I am in L/XL in regular sized clothes!

My weight gain came from an abusive relationship I was in when I got outta high school for 5 years, thinking it was normal after growing up with abusive parents, I ate my feelings a lot and gained 300+ lbs, didn't help I worked at a coffee shop that offered free donuts/soda etc to staff, but I am so glad I got out of that hell over 22+ years ago =) Just took time working on my esteem/confidence and such before starting my weight loss journey, what woke me up was my husband on our 10 year anniversary saying he was worried about me, even more so after we had a doctor who almost unlived me with misdiagnoses all those years ago! 

I never thought I would be able to do this naturally. I had offered for weight loss surgery and such, but I was too hard-headed to do it after seeing a few friends struggle and get depressed after they had it.

1lv4wui,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1lv4wui/looking_for_feedback_on_the_beginning_of_my_first/,Looking for feedback on the beginning of my first novel attempt so far. First three chapters out of a planned 30. Never really tried anything like this before,"The Market

Open 24/7

Chapter 1

The world as you know it sure seems exciting, doesn‚Äôt it?  Fast cars and big screen TVs and high definition internet porn. I guess you‚Äôre not wrong.  Even on the surface, modern life is basically a series of miracles that we all take for granted.  Supercomputers that live in our pockets, a flag on the moon, pineapples in the winter time, I could go on.  I once heard that a single Dorito chip has more nacho cheese flavor than a king would have in his entire lifetime just a few generations ago.

But even beyond these modern miracles there are interesting bits of reality that you likely are unaware of.  My employer, who I will get to in a moment, classifies all people and things into two distinct categories: Conventional and Anomalous.  A Conventional person or thing is exactly as it sounds.  They behave like they should, they obey the laws of physics as they‚Äôre written.  Simple stuff like if you drop a ball it falls to the ground and if you shoot a man in the chest he will have a bad day.  Anomalies, put bluntly, don‚Äôt do this.

Anomalies are something humanity have acknowledge basically forever.  We may have used words like ‚Äúblessed‚Äù or ‚Äúcursed‚Äù or ‚Äúmagical‚Äù but my employer and I don‚Äôt really like those terms because they imply they are not knowable in a way.  They are, they just have their own ruleset that may not be immediately intuitive to an onlooker.  Sometimes a coincidence is just a coincidence, but sometimes it‚Äôs a probability shift.  Usually not.

I‚Äôm David Weiss and I‚Äôm known as a Broker, capital B.  Senior Broker, actually.  Says so right on the door to my office.  My employer is called the Market, capital M.  If you‚Äôre ever in the los angeles area you can try stopping by but I doubt they‚Äôd let you in unless you run a large company or a small country.  In the morning, I enjoy a cup of truly excellent coffee from the Market barista and check the morning emails, making sure nothing is on fire.  Per usual I‚Äôm in a charcoal gray suit and a pink tie.  Why pink, you ask?  Why?  Is there a problem with a pink tie?  I‚Äôm dresscode compliant.

The Market has a few levels.  Level 1 is the marketplace, small m.  You‚Äôll see boring rich people scuttering about purchasing their gold and jewels and fine handbags and fancy shoes and cocaine in a comfortable, well lit, tax-free and anonymous environment with the finest customer service on the planet.  When people come to the Market, they expect the best and we deliver 100% of the time.

Level 1 is reserved for strictly Conventional merchandise.  There are old books and spooky looking relics down there but nothing more enchanted than what you could get at a Hot Topic.  Are those still around? Anyway, the shiny stuff that distracts rich idiots, mainly.  Now there‚Äôs a fundamental truth about the world and some people get mad when you say this so just fasten your seatbelt now: Inequality is inevitable.  There always was, and always will be a wealthy elite who can acquire basically anything they want because they‚Äôre able and willing to pay someone to get it for them. When it comes to anomalous items, however, this creates a major problem.  A billionaire tech dork may hear of some magical doodad that will give him good luck or let him turn pepsi into doctor pepper.  The kinds of people who would go through the trouble of tracking something like that down and then handing it over to a buyer instead of a museum or research facility don‚Äôt tend to be the kindest of humanity.  Mafia, Yakuza, CIA, Cartels, those sorts of guys.  They‚Äôre the competition and they do not have the interests of humanity at heart.  We do. The Market has a strict ethical code we all adhere to.

Plus we are better at our job than them.

The Market (capital M), above the glitz and glamour of level 1, is an organization dedicated to anomalies.  We employ anomalous individuals, we collect anomalous items without a buyer for study and archival, and we deliver the item if it has a Buyer for an enormous finder‚Äôs fee.  We collect the cash so the scum doesn‚Äôt.  In this way we help tip the scales back in the right direction, and the revenue goes into Research and Development.  We can measure the anomalies, classify them, even manipulate them at times.  We don‚Äôt have a full understanding, not yet.  But we will one day and as always, understanding will bring prosperity.

Which brings us to the anomalous people in our employment, myself included.  To me, and this seems to be unique, anomalies have a sort of taste in the air when I am near them.  Which is to say I actually get a taste in my mouth and over the years I have honed this ability like a sommelier to be able to classify what sort of anomaly I am dealing with and how strong it is.  Some will manipulate perception, some can shift probability in one way or another, some can change what you think and feel.  Anomalies are actually surprisingly common but most are so benign you wouldn‚Äôt even notice them.  They may just slightly alter the path of a moth fluttering by and you would be none the wiser.

This evening I am drinking my coffee and a red envelope flutters down from the ceiling.  Administration communicates in this way, it‚Äôs very dramatic.  Emblazoned on the front of the envelope in garish gold ink is ‚ÄúDavid Weiss: Assignment request‚Äù and it appears that today is going to involve some field work, which I prefer to the dull office life.  I open the envelope with a small pocket knife I draw from my suit jacket and read the paper inside

‚ÄúJessica ‚ÄòJess‚Äô Kubler

Age: 24

Suspected anomalies: probability shifting level 2 or 3, emotionally triggered‚Äù

It goes on to list several physical details like height, weight, and identifying marks such as tattoos which I won‚Äôt share here because I‚Äôm sure Jess wouldn‚Äôt like that.  The last line makes my work clear

‚ÄúInterview and recommend for Broker position‚Äù

And it provides an address in Los Angeles not terribly far from Market headquarters, maybe an hour by car.  A bar named ‚ÄúThe Worst Duck‚Äù.  I stand and button my jacket before making my way to the elevator leading to the company garage.  One perk of working for the Market is a company car of your choice, and my choice is a black on black Chevrolet Corvette.  Are there faster cars? More luxurious cars?  More expensive cars that I could have chosen?  Of course, but there aren‚Äôt any cooler cars in my book.  I unbutton my jacket as I beep the doors open and slide into the cool leather seats.  The V8 roars to life and I head out on the road to meet Jess and find out if she is Market material.  We haven‚Äôt had a new Broker in a while, I hope it works out.

Chapter 2

This place is a shithole.  At least the tips are cash and when you‚Äôre drunk enough you cant tell a one dollar bill from a ten.  A couple regulars buy another round of cheap piss-colored beer and a man in the corner smokes a cigarette next to the ‚Äúno smoking‚Äù sign that is legally mandated but I don‚Äôt give a fuck about.  ‚ÄúThe Worst Duck‚Äù What the fuck does that even mean?

‚ÄúHey Jess!‚Äù Calls another regular as he strolls in after work.  Daryl, I think? He still has on a high visibility vest, I think he works for one of those construction companies that you drive by every day and nothing seems to get more done and everyone is standing around staring at a hole in the ground like if they just stare hard enough it‚Äôll pave itself.  He plops down on the seat and orders a beer without making eye contact, content to watch the football game on the TV.  Soon afterwards, a gaunt and unshaven man walks through the door, looking around nervously.  He spots me behind the bar and immediately draws a gun from his hoodie pocket.

‚ÄúGIMME THE FUCKIN CASH‚Äù he practically screams waving the gun in my face.  My heart jumps up into my throat and my hands instinctively rise in a surrender pose ‚ÄúWhoa whoa! It‚Äôs okay dude, whatever you say‚Äù and I walk backwards to the cash register.  The bar patrons slowly back away from the tweaked out man as I turn to open the cash register ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE PUSHING THE GODDAMN PANIC BUTTON!  YOURE CALLING THE COPS!‚Äù he yells in his paranoid state

‚ÄúNo!  Please I‚Äôm just getting your cash, man!‚Äù I beg.  I see him pull the trigger as my heart beats in my neck triple time.

Bang!
Bang!
Bang!
Bang!
Bang!
*click*

He empties his revolver no more than four feet from me.  Every single shot misses.  The tweaker panics and throws his gun at me like a superman comic before sprinting out the door.

Must be my lucky day.

Chapter 3

I park my car neatly in front of ‚ÄúThe Worst Duck‚Äù and kill the engine. What a great name for a bar.  I walk into the smoky, dimly lit room and have a seat at the bar while Garth Brooks plays on a nearby jukebox covered in cigarette burns. I may be standing out like a sore thumb in this dive but I will not say that I am dressed inappropriately, only that everyone else is.  I see the bartender and she looks just like the picture in her profile.  Blonde, muscular in a feminine way.  A black tank top and jeans is essentially the uniform for female bartenders in Los Angeles.  She turns to me with a customer service smile and says ‚ÄúWhat can I get you, Nordstrom Rack?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis suit is bespoke, Jessica.‚Äù I answer ‚ÄúA whiskey and a conversation if you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù I slide five hundred dollar bills across the bar to buy her time.  I can taste her anomaly in the air.  A distinct sweet, almost floral taste that is unique to certain kinds of probability shifting.  She eyes the money and my face searching for trickery and then making a show of checking the validity of the bills with an anti-counterfeiting pen.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Jess,‚Äù She slides a generous pour of cheap whiskey to me and gestures to a booth in the corner ‚ÄúAnd that tip bought you at least five minutes‚Äù

We walk to the booth and I sit opposite her as she continues to eye me skeptically.  ‚ÄúMy employer has sent me here to evaluate you.  You have a unique talent that has tremendous application at our organization and I don‚Äôt mean making bloody marys.‚Äù I pull the sheet from her file from my jacket and gesture to the part mentioning her anomaly.  ‚ÄúThey had suspected you had suspiciously good luck and I can tell by sitting here with you that this is absolutely the case.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmotionally triggered‚Ä¶If I had good luck I‚Äôd have a better fucking job than slinging vodka, Jack.‚Äù Jess scoffs

‚ÄúDavid, actually.  David Weiss, I apologize for my manners‚Äù I extend a hand for a friendly handshake.  She obliges, still keeping the confused and skeptical expression ‚ÄúMay I propose a test?‚Äù I ask as I reach into my suit jacket again

‚ÄúWhat kind of test?‚Äù Jess answers

‚ÄúJust a game of chance.‚Äù  I remove an old looking deck of playing cards from my pocket, take them from their box and set the box on the table before giving them several skilled shuffles like a professional blackjack dealer ‚ÄúDid you know that when you shuffle a deck of cards properly, that particular order of cards has never happened before?  There are eight times ten to the sixty seventh power ways of ordering a deck of cards.  That‚Äôs more than the number of atoms in the solar system.‚Äù  After shuffling I roughly spread the cards all over the table in a messy smear.  ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm going to ask you in a moment to choose four cards, keep them face down.  But we do need one last ingredient according to your file.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù asks Jess.

‚ÄúEmotion.‚Äù I say as I slap her across the face.  Her hand instinctively rises to her cheek with a furious shocked expression.  She stands and punches me square in the mouth as hard as she can.  I hold up my hands ‚ÄúOk! I deserved that!  Now quick grab the cards before you calm down!‚Äù I blot my bloodied lip with a napkin as she angrily grabs four cards and slams them into a small pile next to her.  

‚ÄúFINE!  THERE!  Now what, asshole?‚Äù She shouts at me with balled up fists and a pink mark on her cheek.

‚ÄúTurn them over and see what you got.‚Äù  Her expression softens slightly and she turns the cards over one by one.  Four aces.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù she asks

‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs better than that,‚Äù I say to her as I gather the remaining cards.  I turn them over.  Every other card in the deck is blank.

‚ÄúWho the fuck are you?‚Äù She asks in a mix of anger, fear, and a hint of excitement.

I inspect the blood on the napkin ‚ÄúI‚Äôm what‚Äôs called a Broker.  Senior Broker, actually.  It says so right on the door to my office.  My employer is interested in your talents and, if everything works out, you would receive an enormous pay raise over whatever you‚Äôre making here.  Plus you‚Äôll get to see some cool shit and have your world turned upside down.  No pressure though, I think the gentleman on the end there is due for a refill.‚Äú I check my watch ‚ÄúAnd I believe it‚Äôs close to last call.  I understand this may take some time to consider but-‚Äú

‚ÄúFuck it I‚Äôm in‚Äù Jess cuts me off ‚ÄúGet me out of this dump.‚Äù  She turns to the last patrons at the bar ‚ÄúHey!  Get the hell out!  Closing time.  You don‚Äôt have to go home but you can‚Äôt stay here‚Äù and the last of the drunk guests stumble toward the door.  She sees them out the strides confidently out behind them, locking the door and placing the key in a fake rock behind some bushes.  I unlock the corvette.

‚ÄúDaaaamn!  Nice ride, hotshot.‚Äù She lets out a whistle as she walks to the passenger side.

‚ÄúCompany car.  The benefits package is exquisite.‚Äù I grin as I fire the engine up again.  We pull out of the parking lot and shoot off into the night back home to the Market.",1,1752020627.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

He typically never gets migraines, and we think it's hitting some component of his brain that causes him to panic. He's typically never this stressed out.

Check leggings pockets. No.

1lv4tkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1lv4tkp/joia_rose_hall_by_iberostar_never_again/,JOIA Rose Hall by Iberostar - Never again,"My wife and I recently stayed at the JOIA Rose Hall by Iberostar for our anniversary, and unfortunately, our experience was less than pleasant. When we arrived, the check-in process was underwhelming.¬† We had paid for the upgraded suit and expected to check in via the VIP area, but we were told it was busy and had a standard check-in.¬† While not a problem by itself but it was the beginning of a poor experience.¬†

Speaking of the room, it wasn‚Äôt what I expected. While the pictures online looked nice, our suite felt a bit outdated.¬† Many of the wall USB chargers didn‚Äôt work and we ended up having to charge our phones in the bathroom.¬† The patio overlooking the ocean and pool was large and visually the nicest part of the room.  The swinging chair was equally a nice touch after the pool to watch the sunsets.  ¬†¬†¬† ¬†

Our room came with two butlers to help with accommodations and again another disappointment.¬† During check-in our butler set up a WhatsApp chat with us, himself and the afternoon butler.¬† We were told to text him with any requests.¬† Our first request was to help with reservations with dinner for the week.¬† We were told that the restaurant didn‚Äôt accept reservations except hibachi and to ‚Äòget there early‚Äô.¬† We had a group coming in later that week and asked if he could help with a reservation for hibachi later in the week.¬† We were told that it was closed on Thursday.¬† On Thursday, we went to the steak restaurant and see that hibachi was open and that our hostess at the steak restaurant helped us get into hibachi with a party of 11.¬† Our afternoon butler was much more effective than the daytime one.¬† On Friday we wanted to try another restaurant and mentioned it to the second butler who went to the restaurant to put our names in and told us to get there in 45 mins.¬† The food at all the restaurants was good but not great.¬† Throughout the course of the week, we used the drinking glasses and housekeeping took the dirty glasses and they never replaced them.¬† By the end of the week, we were drinking wine out of the coffee cups as the coffee maker was broken hence the clean cups.¬† The pools were nice, but the poolside service wasn‚Äôt very good.¬†

Other areas of note, the gym at the facility was nice but it was very small and not mentioned that the gym was in the other building which was a 10 min walk.¬† It was very small and got very crowded.¬† In the evenings, the resort had very little after hours activates other than what was scheduled in the theater.¬† If there were activities our butler did not inform us.¬† The lobby bar was nice, but the service was very slow while not crowded.¬† If you want a bottle of liquor in your room, you‚Äôll want to buy it at the airport.¬† They will not stock your room like every other all-inclusive we‚Äôve ever stayed at. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Our checkout was equally inadequate.¬† Our checkout was 12 and our transportation to the airport was scheduled to pick up at 1.¬† We were told we‚Äôd have someone at our room at 12 to pick up our bags.¬† At 1215, no one showed I contacted the butler, but no response then called the front desk.¬† At 1230 still no one showed so I just took the bags to the front desk to check out.¬† While this wasn‚Äôt an issue in itself, being told to expect something at a given time was disappointing.

All in all, this was undoubtable one of the worse experiences in an all-inclusive resort.¬† I view my time off and discretionary funds very limited, so I do expect a certain level of service.¬† This experience did not live up to my expectations and I want others to be equally aware of your return on investment.¬†

1lv4t0s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lv4t0s,My recent pickups :),"Long post ahead so bear with me lol. These are my recent decant pickups from my ‚ú®‚ÄúDecant haul‚Äù. ‚ú® I‚Äôve got a total of 10 decants from Sovereign Scents u/Few-lab7554 (1 week ago) and the 2ml ones are from Imran Farooqui (6 months back). I let them settle for a week and I‚Äôve given a brief review on how I feel they are to my not so experienced nose. 

[start] 

üÄÑÔ∏è **Blue by Ahmed** - A beautiful clone of Bleu de Chanel. The opening is a  perfect blend of citrus and woods which later settles into a musky woody jasmine kind of scent. The dry-down on this is so classy and elegant! A good office/college scent. 

‚Ä¢Longevity : 6-7 hours (3-4 weeks macerated bottle) 
‚Ä¢Projection : 2-3 feet; moderate 

Rating - 8.5/10 


üÄÑÔ∏è **Versace Dylan Blue** - An inoffensive daily driver scent but kinda generic. Bergamot opening with ambroxan dry down is all I smell from this. Nothing too special. (Yet to do a full wear) 

‚Ä¢Longevity : ~4 hours (didn‚Äôt test much) 
‚Ä¢Projection : 1-2 feet; slightly moderate 

Rating - 6/10 


üÄÑÔ∏è **Afnan Supremacy Not Only Intense** - I absolutely do not love this aventus DNA I don‚Äôt get the hype üò≠. Opens with this ‚Äúdirty‚Äù oakmoss with little citrus ( I don‚Äôt smell any pineapple :/) and later settles into the aventus dna which I think is okay and it maybe classy or mature. It has to grow on me a lot before I start liking it ig lol..

‚Ä¢Longevity : 6 hours (didn‚Äôt test much) 
‚Ä¢Projection : NA 

Rating - 4/10 


üÄÑÔ∏è **Afnan Supremacy Collector‚Äôs Edition** - Very very sweet cloying opening. Opens with fruity and white floral notes with very slight hints of pepper maybe idk.. and then just gets less sweeter and has a good dry down. Something different from ‚Äúaventus‚Äù DNA. I‚Äôd say this is much of a winter frag cuz this definitely does get very cloying in heat. 

‚Ä¢Longevity : 7-8 hours (didn‚Äôt test much) 
‚Ä¢Projection : good (3-4 feet) 

Rating - 6/10


üÄÑÔ∏è **CDNIM Pure Parfum** - This is basically SNOI - 80% dirty oakmoss. It has slight hints of pineapple with little oakmoss and brighter citrus opening. Dry down is more or less the same to that of SNOI but much brighter and fresher imo. Mom said this smelt unique and classy üôÇüò≠

‚Ä¢Longevity : 4-5 hours (didn‚Äôt test much but SNOI lasts longer) 
‚Ä¢Projection : okayish 

Rating - 5.5/10 


üÄÑÔ∏è **CDNIM Limited Edition** - Definitely much better, elegant and a refined version of CDNIM PP! It‚Äôs a much more cleaner version and transitions smoothly as compared to others. I like this somewhat more than the other aventus clones. 

‚Ä¢Longevity : 5 hours (didn‚Äôt test much) 
‚Ä¢Projection : idk 

Rating - 6.5/10


üÄÑÔ∏è **Rasasi Fattan** - This is 60-70% similar to TDH edt. This lacks the beautifully blended citrus opening and only smells like fresh green grass/ vetiver. Very linear scent, doesn‚Äôt change much till the dry-down. I prefer TDH over this any day! 

‚Ä¢Longevity : 6-7 hours 
‚Ä¢Projection : mild 

Rating - 4/10 


üÄÑÔ∏è **Khamrah Qahwa** - Beautiful and elegant gourmand winter fragrance! The coffee note in this screams masculinity and its better than the OG Khamrah.. only downside is that the coffee note fades away after 20 minutes and gets similar to the OG. The coffee note used to be potent and headache inducing but after 6 months of maceration, this is perfect! 

‚Ä¢Longevity - 10 hours + (sometimes days)
‚Ä¢Projection - very strong projection for first 2 hours; mild for another 2 

Rating - 9.5/10 


üÄÑÔ∏è **Lattafa Ameer Al Oudh Intense** - The combination of oud woody and vanilla notes is perfect and this can be used as a daily driver in winters! This smells like every middle eastern shopping mall lol. The oud in this is not at all potent and very refined. No brainer buy! 

‚Ä¢Longevity : 8-10 hours 
‚Ä¢Projection : moderate but good 

Rating - 8/10


üÄÑÔ∏è **Afnan 9PM** - Oh boy this is a sexy seductive fragrance! I didn‚Äôt like it as much when I had a 2ml decant but now I love this!! It has that fruity bubblegummy and playful opening and dries down into a vanilla creamy cozy scent. Best for outings and parties. 

‚Ä¢Longevity : 6 hours 
‚Ä¢Projection : strong for 1-2 hours 

Rating - 9/10 


üÄÑÔ∏è **Versace Eros EDT** - I already have a miniature (5ml) dab-on bottle of this so had to get an empty decant bottle to be able to use it. It‚Äôs a cozy warm and seductive fragrance! It opens with green apple/pear and mint which is beautifully masked by vanilla. Really good for chill evenings or fall üçÇ

‚Ä¢Longevity : 5-6 hours (didn‚Äôt test much) 
‚Ä¢Projection : moderate 

Rating - 7/10 


üÄÑÔ∏è **Liquid Brun** - Cinnamon sweet with hints of cardamom in the opening and it smells like some chai biscuit. Not overly sweet and feels sophisticated and masculine. Dries down into a vanilla woody creamy powdery base and is very seductive! Much more versatile than Khamrah and can be pulled off easily. 

‚Ä¢Longevity : 6-7 hours (everyone claims this to be beast mode idk what‚Äôs wrong lol) 
‚Ä¢Projection : moderate; not into the face 

Rating - 8.5/10 


üÄÑÔ∏è **Aether Extrait** - Green apple heavy opening with citrus in the background. It‚Äôs a great fresh into the face clean scent. I think the dry down doesn‚Äôt change much and stays linear throughout. 

‚Ä¢Longevity: 5-6 hours 
‚Ä¢Projection : moderate (1-2 feet) 

Rating - 7.5/10 

[end] 

Thanks to Himanshu (Sovereign Scents) for these beautiful decants and delivering it quickly. Feel free to ask any questions and suggest! Thanks for reading ‚ô•Ô∏è

1lv4s92,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLoophole/comments/1lv4s92/loophole_online_update_what_im_working_on/,Loophole Online Update: What I'm Working On,"Hey my starbursts,

I've been working so hard and in so much secret. Time to come out of my cave a little bit I think.

You‚Äôre probably wondering when Loophole Online will launch and what‚Äôs actually behind this [waitlist](https://theloophole.com/?utm_source=reddit) wall. So I am here to challenge myself to build in public and and not wait until it's perfect to tell you about it.

Here's where we are right now with Loophole Online:

* 398 completed videos totaling 35 hours of course material ‚úÖ
   * And they‚Äôre all organized into a real online course with an order ü§©
* 115 more videos to come ‚òïÔ∏è (the coffee emoji means it‚Äôs still brewing)
   * Will I really finish recording *all* these videos before launching the platform? Eh, depends on how bad ya‚Äôll want them. But a fair number of them will get done.
* 86 custom drills ‚úÖ
   * These are the drills that I have created over the past six years in tutoring. They are my secret sauce and in my opinion the most valuable part of this whole platform. (Spoiler: Not one of them is Level 5 Weaken problem set because I don't believe in that kinda thing üíÉüèª‚ò†Ô∏è)
   * Also, I organized these drills into families so that you can sub out one custom drill for another in the same family if you need help with a different sort of issue.
* 55 homework routines ‚òïÔ∏è
   * This is where I combine all my drills into custom homework routines. I tell you how to do them, why to do them, and how to move on from them, creating a whole prep schedule and strategy for you according to your unique issues.
   * And there's also homework routine progression! So basically all the routines line up, and when you beat certain objectives on one of them, you get to move to the next one.
* Then I put all these drills, routines, videos (and bootcamps and more infinity) on the PREP MAP ‚òïÔ∏è
   * The Prep Map exists because you *need* a map to get through what is essentially an online platform containing my entire human mind.
   * The Prep Map has 5 stages to get you through this whole LSAT thing: Learn, Translation, Accuracy, Speed, Perform.
   * Each stage has videos, routines, drills, resources, advice, and outcomes to guide you through that stage of LSAT prep and make sure that you're prepared as you inch closer to test day.

**So, what did I do today?** Well, I wrote the why, how, and how to move on sections for 19 new homework routines and finalized those same sections on the 7 Translation Core Routines and the 7 Speed Core Routines. I'll do more later tonight. Hoping I can complete the remaining 25ish routine strategies in the next two days. The routines themselves are already written (Although I kind of want to make more? Probably overkill, right?).

Just remember, as you wait for this and as it finally comes out, that I‚Äôve been doing this for you Loophole readers this whole time. Every single one of you that has emailed me your story of going through the Loophole and how it felt like I knew you and believed in you ‚Äî I did. And I do. And that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt want to make you something half-assed and stupid. I wanted to give my best because that‚Äôs what you deserve. My best is just complicated and takes a long time, but I have that feeling again that I had when I wrote the Loophole. That I‚Äôm actually making something good. And I apologize for all these years where it probably felt like I was ignoring you, just tutoring and letting the Loophole do all the work for me. I wasn‚Äôt ignoring you. I was learning enough to give you something better.

This is that thing.

So reply to tell me what you want screenshots of, what questions you have, and where you want me to dive in more. I‚Äôll send more in my next update (which I promise will be shorter).

With all my love as always,

The highways are clogged with abandoned cars, some still running, doors hanging open like their owners just‚Ä¶ stepped out mid-drive.

Gas stations are picked clean, but sometimes I find candy bars in glove compartments. A warm Coke under a seat. Once, a half-eaten bag of pretzels crawling with ants. I ate around them.

The broadcast never changes.

The highway stretched empty for miles, nothing but cracked asphalt and the occasional corpse of a dead car. Three days of silence, three days of watching the rearview mirror for movement that never came.

Then the headlights appeared.

They glowed in my mirror like two yellow eyes. The black sedan crept closer, its engine silent. It pulled alongside me, matching my speed exactly.

I turned my head.

The driver wore my face.

My denim jacket with the torn pocket. My chipped front tooth. And her smile...

Her lips stretched across her teeth like skin over a drum.

I slammed the brakes. The world spun. When the car finally stopped, I sat there shaking, gripping the wheel until my knuckles turned white. I'm losing my mind. And mocking me, the radio kept on saying:

*""If you‚Äôre hearing this, you‚Äôre the last one left.""*

I‚Äôm losing time. Losing track of what‚Äôs real.

Today, something changed.¬†

A glitch.¬†

Then, between loops, a breath.¬†

Panicked.¬†

Then my voice again:

‚Äú*They‚Äôre coming up the tower stairs.*‚Äù

That version of me sounded terrified.

I drive straight to the tower. The Emergency Broadcast Station. I think I used to work there. The layout‚Äôs burned into my muscle memory. I had my own show once, didn‚Äôt I?¬†

The parking lot is empty. Inside, the lights are still on. Coffee cup on the desk. Lipstick on the rim. My color.

The microphone is live. The recording is queued.

On the floor, my phone.

I pick it up. One voicemail. Sent three days ago.

I press play.

My voice, desperate:

‚Äú*They‚Äôre copying us. They sound like us. Look like us. But they‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre not‚Äî*‚Äù

The message cuts out.

The radio kicks in again overhead:

‚Äú*If you‚Äôre hearing this, you‚Äôre the last one left.*‚Äù

I stare at the micBehind me, the studio door creaks open.

Footsteps are heard behind me.

A voice‚Äî*my voice*‚Äîsays:

‚ÄúFound you.‚Äù

1lv4l6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1lv4l6n/experience_with_the_hat_man/,experience with the hat man,"I was maybe seven or eight years old when it happened. It was one of those nights where fever distorts everything‚Äîthoughts, time, even the shadows on the walls. My head was pounding, my body burning, and every sound in the darkness felt twice as loud, twice as close. I lay in my bed, surrounded by toys and familiar things, yet that night, nothing felt familiar.

Sometime between feverish dozing and drifting off, I noticed him. At first, I thought my feverish eyes were playing tricks on me. But then the shape became clearer: In the corner of my room, where the wardrobe stood, a silhouette started to form.

He was huge‚Äîtaller than any adult I‚Äôd ever seen. His shoulders were angular, almost too wide for the room. And on his head sat a hat, pulled low over his face so I couldn‚Äôt see his eyes. But I knew he was looking at me. Staring. Motionless.

I wanted to scream, but no sound came out. My body felt as if it had been nailed down. I just lay there, frozen with fear, my face drenched in sweat, the blanket pulled up to my chin. Seconds stretched into minutes, minutes into an eternity. And then, at some point, he was gone. Just like that. No movement, no sound. Only the darkness remained‚Äîand the sense that something wasn‚Äôt right.

I never told anyone. Who would‚Äôve believed me? ‚ÄúFever dreams,‚Äù they would‚Äôve said. ‚ÄúHallucinations. Totally normal.‚Äù And I wanted to believe that, too. For years.

Fourteen years later, I was up late at night, randomly clicking around on the internet, when I stumbled across an article: The Hat Man‚Äîa shadowy figure seen by people all over the world in sleep-like states. Tall. Silent. Wearing a hat.

My heart skipped a beat. There he was‚Äîmy man with the hat. Other people had seen him too. Exactly the way I remembered him. It felt like someone had ripped the memory out of my mind and posted it online.

Since then, I‚Äôve wondered: Was it really just the fever? Or did I see something that night‚Äîsomething beyond our understanding? Something that creeps into our consciousness through dreams and sickness, through fear and shadow‚Äîsilent, watching, wearing a hat?

Sometimes, when I lie awake at night and a shadow shifts in the corner of my bedroom, I wonder: Is he back?

A lot of time has passed since that night when I first read about the Hat Man. I‚Äôm now in my mid-twenties, living alone in a small old apartment on the edge of the city. My life is quiet, maybe a little lonely, but orderly‚Äîmost of the time.

And yet, there are those nights. Nights when the darkness feels heavier than usual. When my bedroom seems colder, even though the heater‚Äôs on. When I wake up without knowing why‚Äîdrenched in sweat, heart racing, a strange pull in my chest like something deep inside has been stirred.

I try to calm myself down. Tell myself it‚Äôs just stress, overwork, too much coffee, too little sleep. But the feeling lingers. It waits.

A week ago, it started again. I‚Äôd worked late, sat in front of the screen for hours until my eyes burned. When I finally crawled into bed, it was well past midnight. I fell asleep quickly‚Äîtoo quickly. And I dreamed. Of a long hallway with all the doors open. I walked through, one after another, and behind each was the same scene: a dark room, a child in bed‚Äîand a figure in the corner. Tall. Wearing a hat.

I woke up screaming. My T-shirt was soaked, the bed covers a mess. And in the corner of my room stood‚Äînothing. Of course not. I laughed, nervously, but my heart was pounding.

The next night, I decided to ignore it. I put on an audiobook, left the hallway light on, and tried to settle down. But sometime during the night, it happened again: I woke up. Not because of a sound, but because of a feeling‚Äîan ancient, instinctual knowing. As if something had been watching me. Or‚Ä¶ still was.

This time, I dared to sit up. My eyes slowly moved to the corner of the room‚Äîand my breath caught.

He was there.

Not as a dream. Not as a vision. But real. Standing there, just like before. Massive. Still. The hat low over his face. Only this time, I wasn‚Äôt a feverish child. I was awake. And I could see him.

My body froze instantly. The fear didn‚Äôt hit like a jolt‚Äîit crept in, slowly, like cold fingers wrapping around my heart. I wanted to scream, to move, to jump up and turn on the light. But nothing worked.

He lifted his head‚Äîjust slightly. Just enough for me to glimpse beneath the brim of his hat. No face. Only darkness. And yet I knew: He was looking at me.

And then‚Äîjust like the first time‚Äîhe vanished. Simply gone. As if the darkness had swallowed him whole.

After that night, I was done. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, couldn‚Äôt eat, couldn‚Äôt think straight. I kept seeing him‚Äîhis silhouette, his size, that eerie hat. It felt like he had opened a door inside me that would never close again.

By the time Jason‚Äôs alarm went off in the morning, he‚Äôd barely gotten any sleep. He hadn‚Äôt stayed up all that late last night by Earth standards, but thanks to the twenty-ish-hour day on board the ship he‚Äôd only been left with about two hours to sleep after he took a break from his search for Earth. Despite that, he still arrived at the cafeteria before the rest of the group. Choosing his breakfast based on nothing more than what he hadn‚Äôt had the day before, he filled up his tray with alien food and copious quantities of space coffee and headed back out to the same seat he‚Äôd previously occupied by the window. 

Moments after Jason sat down, he was joined by someone he hadn‚Äôt met before. Mentally, he ran through the list of alien species he had briefly studied the night before, trying to match the face in front of him to the example photos. But the name of the species wouldn‚Äôt come to mind. The reptilian being was about a head shorter than him and lacked any features that he could recognize as indicating their gender. Their scales were mostly green, with a few hints of purple here and there on their face and a bit of orange around their neck. Iguana-like spines ran from their forehead, up over the top of the skull and down to the base of the neck. The spines peaked in height at maybe three or four inches in length on the top of the being‚Äôs head and gradually tapered into nothingness in either direction from there. Other than the scales and the spines, they were mostly humanoid in shape. Their uniform consisted of a thick, warm-looking gray jacket and a matching set of pants, with an orange pin on the left shoulder strap. Jason remembered that the gray uniform signified they were a member of the bridge crew, and orange meant flight operations. 

‚ÄúJason?‚Äù the being asked as they took the seat across from him. The translator chose a voice that was decidedly female. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me,‚Äù he confirmed, and suddenly he had an idea of this person‚Äôs identity. A female navigator, who wasn‚Äôt a species he‚Äôd seen at all on his first day, who might be interested in talking to the newest abductee. 

His theory was confirmed when the new arrival introduced herself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Oyre. Second shift assistant navigator. Welcome aboard.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Jason replied.

‚ÄúPlanning on staying?‚Äù Oyre asked. As she said it, the pattern on her scales shifted like a chameleon. The purple became less prominent, and some of the green turned orange. 

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Jason nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm already working with Lakim down in engineering. I was a mechanic back home.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was an astronomer,‚Äù Oyre offered. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I got into navigation here. Not like we really have much of a choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Jason agreed. Not knowing anything about life outside of Earth, it would be a pretty big risk to turn down not only a job, but the housing and food that came with it. And he couldn‚Äôt imagine her situation was much different. ‚ÄúHow long have you been here?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlmost a year,‚Äù Oyre replied. 

Jason waved to Farranax, Hjelin, and the others as they appeared in the hallway between the two sides of the cafeteria.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve met the others already?‚Äù Oyre asked, glancing towards the group but quickly looking away before anyone made eye contact. ‚ÄúWhatever they told you about me, they‚Äôre wrong.‚Äù

Despite the warnings from the others, Jason didn‚Äôt want to push her away. He knew that a navigator would know the map of the galaxy far better than he did. Would know how to use all of the advanced search tools that he hadn‚Äôt been able to figure out on his own last night. Which classifications of stars and planets to look for. She seemed nice enough so far, and he suspected he might need her help if he ever wanted to go home. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶‚Äù he began, and he could already feel his face beginning to turn red as he said it. 

‚ÄúPlease, they‚Äôve told the whole damned ship already,‚Äù Oyre interrupted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crazy like they said, and I can prove it.‚Äù

In Jason‚Äôs experience, that was usually followed up by the most outrageous claim imaginable. Whether it was his brother who thought the President was an Illuminati lizard-person, or those customers who insisted that they didn‚Äôt need an inspection, registration, or license plate because they were ‚Äòtraveling‚Äô instead of driving, he‚Äôd never once heard that sentence followed by anything that remotely made sense. ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo days after we leave Harlaan, we‚Äôre going to go into lockdown because of ‚Äòpirate activity in the area,‚Äô‚Äù she said quietly but with all the confidence of Jason‚Äôs brother talking about the lizard people. And just like that, he knew exactly what the others had been talking about. ‚ÄúA day after that, we‚Äôre going to pick up a stage one primitive.‚Äù

Stage one, Jason now knew, referred to a civilization that had developed agriculture but had not yet mastered metalworking. ‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he scoffed. ‚ÄúHow would you know that?‚Äù Based on his experience talking to his brother, he suspected that nothing would happen and then she‚Äôd push the date a little while into the future and repeat the same bullshit over again. 

‚ÄúI know how it sounds,‚Äù Oyre replied. By now, Farranax was on his way over to the table, already glaring at Oyre. She glanced over to him, looked back to Jason, and said, ‚ÄúJust ‚Ä¶ if I‚Äôm right, promise you‚Äôll hear me out?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Jason said automatically, giving her the same ‚Äòsmile-and-nod‚Äô response his brother would have gotten back home. He suspected the chances of her being right were about the same as the chances of his 5G microchip being activated. If Troy was right, that ought to have happened about seven times by now, and yet it hadn‚Äôt. When the time came and nothing happened, the story would change and he‚Äôd just have to smile and nod his way through whatever excuse was offered this time. He could understand why the others had advised him to avoid her.

Just before Farranax arrived, Oyre got up to leave. Her words stuck in Jason‚Äôs mind, and after a moment he realized why. ‚ÄòIf I‚Äôm right,‚Äô she had said. ‚Äò*If*.‚Äô That word wasn‚Äôt in his brother‚Äôs vocabulary. Every bit of crazy bullshit Troy had ever said had been said with one hundred percent certainty. Then again, he was trying to apply Human psychology to an alien mind. Maybe alien nutjobs weren‚Äôt quite so stubborn as their Human equivalents. 

‚ÄúI see what you mean,‚Äù Jason said to Farranax as he sat down in the seat Oyre had just vacated. 

‚ÄúLet me guess,‚Äù Farranax said. ‚ÄúShe was telling you about the three hundred years that didn‚Äôt exist?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Jason replied. ‚ÄúPredicting future pirate attacks.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, right,‚Äù Farranax said. ‚ÄúNot the first time she‚Äôs tried that, either. Funny how she knows about the ones that are going to happen soon and not the one that actually happened a few days ago, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Jason agreed. ‚ÄúReminds me of my brother. I couldn‚Äôt tell you how many times he tried to predict the collapse of civilization. That day comes, nothing happens, and instead of admitting he‚Äôs wrong, he‚Äôll just start saying another date a few months into the future.‚Äù 

Farranax laughed. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve heard that one before.‚Äù

After breakfast, Jason went back to work in the engine room. The drive unit Lakim had been working on yesterday was mostly reassembled by now, and the area around it was about as neat and tidy as a work-in-progress engine rebuild could be. Once Jason was clocked in, Lakim said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre landing on Harlaan later today. We have to run checks on the landing gear, atmospheric thrusters, and shields before we‚Äôll be allowed to enter orbit, and that normally takes most of the day. Once we‚Äôre planetside, most of the crew will have five days of shore leave. You and I will have to be back here a day early for the pre-flight checks. When we‚Äôre on shore leave, you can pretty much do whatever you want as long as you don‚Äôt get yourself arrested and you‚Äôre back here sober and on time.‚Äù

Jason already knew most of his time on leave would be spent filling out all of the paperwork that would be necessary for him to become a legal resident of the galaxy, but he didn‚Äôt have time to point that out before Lakim added, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to get you measured for a space suit so you can get started with EVA training. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be able to pick it up until we get to Tyonnal next month, though. They‚Äôre usually made to order.‚Äù

‚ÄúEVA training?‚Äù Jason asked. 

‚ÄúIn case we need to do emergency mid-flight repairs on the hull or any of the external components,‚Äù Lakim explained. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt happen often, but when it does we really need it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Jason nodded. As a little kid, he‚Äôd wanted to be an astronaut until he‚Äôd realized the amount of school required for a career like that. He‚Äôd be lying if he said he wasn‚Äôt excited about the idea, but it wasn‚Äôt quite enough to make him want to stay out here for a minute longer than he had to. 

Lakim led Jason through a service hatch, down some very narrow hallways that got uncomfortably close to some very hot coolant pipes, and into the room that housed the ship‚Äôs landing gear. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one landing leg on each corner of the ship,‚Äù Lakim explained. ‚ÄúStart with a visual inspection of the whole system. Look for any signs of damage on the wiring, leaking hydraulic fluid, torn rubber boots, stuff like that.‚Äù

Jason took the lead, doing the first part of the inspection by himself while Lakim trailed behind him to make sure he didn‚Äôt miss anything. When they found nothing noteworthy, they moved on to the second part of the job. Lakim flipped a switch and the system hummed to life as several of the room‚Äôs computer screens turned on. He logged into one of the computers and ran a diagnostic program, which promptly reported that everything was working as intended. As each diagnostic finished, Lakim read off the results. ‚ÄúThe strut has power ‚Ä¶ hydraulic pressure is in the blue ‚Ä¶ motors report full range of motion ‚Ä¶ this one‚Äôs good.‚Äù

Lakim logged out of the computer and said, ‚ÄúLeave this powered on until we‚Äôre ready to leave the atmosphere. Safety regulations require us to run a full check every power cycle.‚Äù

The second landing strut was only slightly easier to access than the first, and once they were there Jason took the lead. He logged into the system using his own credentials and was able to figure out how to run the diagnostics after only a brief moment of staring at the controls. Like the first one, this strut also reported no issues. When the third and fourth struts also passed the inspection, they moved on to the atmospheric thrusters. 

As Jason had learned while ‚Äòhelping‚Äô with the engine rebuild yesterday, spaceships were equipped with two different types of engines. The far more powerful star drives were used only after breaking orbit, and they were what made it possible to travel between solar systems in only days or weeks instead of the decades or centuries that it would take with the best technology Earth had to offer. But their radioactive exhaust gases made them unsafe for use anywhere near an inhabited planet. Besides, with the amount of thrust they produced, using them in atmosphere would be a bit like trying to parallel park a dragster with a stuck throttle. The atmospheric thrusters were actually not that much more advanced than Human-built rockets, at least as far as Jason could tell. Not that he really knew much of anything about rockets. The main improvements were some added trickery using the shields and the artificial gravity to significantly reduce fuel consumption and improve maneuverability. 

While Jason would be the first to admit that he was no rocket scientist, he had to admit that the Tyon shipbuilders had done a pretty good job of dumbing it down for him. When he and Lakim ran the diagnostic, one of the thrusters reported low fuel pressure. And instead of just a cryptic code that told him where to start troubleshooting like he would have seen back home, the computer actually told him that the fuel pump was reporting lower than optimal efficiency on that drive unit. Under Lakim‚Äôs supervision, Jason flipped to the corresponding page in the service manual and found unambiguous, detailed step-by-step instructions to replace the faulty part. To his surprise, everything under the engine cover was clearly labeled and easy to reach. Within half an hour, the job was done and the atmospheric thrusters were ready for use.

The final check before landing was the shields. The ship was quite literally shaped like a flying brick, so the shields would be required during both landing and take-off to alter the ship‚Äôs aerodynamic profile into something a little more suitable to atmospheric flight. And, of course, to protect the occupants of the ship from the heat generated by the friction of the atmosphere. After a quick visual inspection of the wiring and another computer diagnostic, Lakim fired up the shields. With that, they were ready for landing. 

The engine room, like every area of the ship, was equipped with seats specifically for atmospheric flight. There were five in total, all lined up in a row like airplane seats, each equipped with a five-point harness. Jason and Lakim took their seats and strapped in, although there wasn‚Äôt much of a view out the window. Jason got a brief glimpse of a large ocean, partially obscured by clouds, before the heat began to burn away the view. The shield did its job, giving a faint electric blue tint to the flames and occasionally throwing a shower of sparks when one area or another got particularly hot. Jason had been expecting a very bumpy ride given the restraints, but to his surprise it really didn‚Äôt feel much different from the usual turbulence on an airplane. Within only a few minutes, Jason was officially on his first alien planet.",11,1752019653.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

Made a cup of April El Morito Washed Pacamara, Guatemala.  15/250 v60 1:16, 4:6 sweet/standard. K6 at 90.  

Brewed with 98c 0ppm water; poured into 2 cupping bowls with a bit left for reference to u modified brew. Added 2 drops of April minerals to one bowl, 2 drops of LC minerals to the other.  

Unmodified 0ppm water was a little hollow, minimal acid presentation, minimal fruit evident.  Some sweetness but not much to sing about.  

LC mineral bowl was round and balanced by comparison; a ‚Äúnice cup of coffee‚Äù take without any bright or acid notes dominating. 

April bowl was more different than expected - more brightness, a rounded but pleasant acidity.  At this point checked for the tasting notes - red berries were evident.  

Returning to the 0ppm, its hollowness was especially evident.  

Returning to LC  revealed some juicy stone fruit notes - maybe an unsweet chutney.  It‚Äôs a reserved presentation, subtle.  Mouthfeel is very nice.  

Returning to April, I noted fruity / pulpy notes, high acidity notes, a little spice, some grapefruit as per tasting notes.   



I did also make a cup of Prodigal Natural Ethiopian - not a coffee I‚Äôve been entirely in love with to date. I did similar prep to above but with 4:6 acidic; and I used 50ppm April water only.  

The acidity in this cup was not as pronounced as I‚Äôve had it with Lotus Light and Bright, but it was very well balanced.  

I‚Äôm guessing that I‚Äôll end up preferring April minerals for most of the coffees I drink (mostly washed with a smaller number of naturals and process-forward) based on its higher acidity and fruit notes. But we shall see ‚Äî this is only the first brew, and i have yet to get great results from this particular April Pacamara.  Tomorrow I‚Äôll try some more familiar beans.  


If anyone‚Äôs curious I can compare to Lotus. 

I typically remineralize the water in the kettle ‚Äî if anyone cares I can try varying ppm with either brand.  Historically I have typically brewed LC water at 30-50 ppm, but based on what I taste from the April minerals I think I will experiment with higher ppm as well, which will be an interesting comparison to the Lotus recipes which result in ppm above 100, up to 2xx (Simple and Sweet).

Is it possible that I could‚Äôve completely destroyed my voice? It‚Äôs not getting any better and I am incredibly upset over it.

House built in 1986, assuming original panel, I want to add 2 or 3 new breakers. 

First electrician said it I had space to add up to 4 new breakers, but that it was getting harder to find the breaker for this type of panel.

The second electrician said I didn't have space to add new breakers, but  he could move some things around to make it possible to add a maximum of 2 new breakers. 

How do I know how many breakers a panel can hold? New homeowner and never worked with an electrician before, both were extremely nice and seemed knowledgeable. Planning to get additional estimates, but was hoping there was a way to tell if the panel can be expanded. 

Here are pictures of the panel. Thank you for your help.

I'm lost.","I've always been bad in school mainly because I didn't take studying seriously and always played around and wasted time unlike my peers who studied and succeeded and I also partially blame it on family problems. Still I reached Bac and by the time I did I started suffering from many mental problems. Especially depression, Self sabotage and OCD, and I firmly believe I've these three even though I was never diagnosed by a professional or an expert. So despite repeating 4 years I could never succeed Bac, I fail the exams deliberately and make myself suffer on purpose, last year I got 9,73/20. I visited psychiatrists and they didn't really help me much, They gave me bunch medicines and they ruined me. I lost a lot of money for nothing.

After that, I spent 7 months doing nothing and staying at home in front of my computer/phone screen the whole time. My living situation deteriorated really fast and I remained unemployed.

Then one day I heard about a new coffee roasting factory opening up and I went there and immediately got the job and since that day I worked like a slave. Everyday I worked 12+ hours mostly cleaning the floors, taking out the garbage, cleaning toilets, cleaning the table after lunchbreak, lifting heavy bags and heavy objects, Buying food and other stuff for the workers, buying coffee for the Boss and his clients and so on... Even though I was told that I was going to learn how to roast coffee beans and work full time as a coffee roaster, it never happened. It was a skill that was gatekept from me. The coffee roaster taught his brother-in-law and the boss' cousin but never taught me. Anyhow, none of this was the worst thing about this job. The worst thing was I was regularily abused. I was yelled at, cursed at, ridiculed, mocked, hit and beaten, humiliated, insulted, forced to do very degrading deeds, disrespected and so on... and everyone was aware of it and no one did anything about it. In fact everyone were on very good terms with those who abused me. On top of all this, the boss out of the blue decided not to give me my full salary for no good reason, Only because he saw his business as not earning enough money and so to cut losses he gave a quarter of my salary while the others didn't lose much, I had the worst hit. The next month I wasn't paid at all and my mom still thinks I should stay working there but no, I worked for 6 months and I had enough, I left.

Now, I'm unemployed again and have been like for two months, I couldn't find a job. Actually, I found a job but it's a cleaning products factory and from what I saw and heard, It's way worse than the previous factory I was working in so I'm interested in going there.

In Disco Elysium it seems the entire game is a big story being told over numerous dialogues and monologues.  
I enjoy and sit through many of the dialogues look with Cuno and other interesting characters..  
But i find myself skipping much of the dialogues:

1. I get impatient after playing 30-40 minutes. Like an ADHD that requires more active stimulus.
2. An innate desire to make progress, get rewards, achievements, skills, thoughts. When i read dialogue from a single person for 20 minutes, it feels like the game is not moving.
3. Some of the dialogue is just much harder for me to sit through patiently and listen.

I really enjoyed speaking with Cuno and Lilienne, and other characters where i have a connection with, and the dialogue is interesting..  
But some characters just talk about things like ""Seraseolitic civilization on the Insulindian isola"", and the history and politics related to that..  
\- It unrelated to my case and my objectives  
\- The high language and new terms and phrases make it harder to comprehend and grasp. It's feels like studying.  
\- It's tiring and requires thinking, and doesn't seem to offer a real reward (unlike choosing a new thought or skill, which is much more rewarding and enticing)

Give the fact that i am now probably skipping 50%-60% of the dialogue ( i try to glance at it before skipping), i feel like i'm missing the main point of the game which is the story.  
Maybe this style of game just isn't for me?

Has anyone else gone through this? How did you deal with it?

I want to grab a cup of coffee and try to play the game more patiently, especially some of the dialogues..  
But also some other parts of dialogue will probably never be compelling to me.. (e.g. history of various civilizations and the countries and culture etc..)

On The Logs, Tall-Nut opposes the Logs‚Äô cheating strategy they seem to be adapting, shame no one on his team is interested in his nonsense.
On Shining Stars, Sea Sharron and Magnet Shroom notice they have been abandoned by their Fun Guy brethren, noticing their outcast status, decide to befriend eachother and form an alliance!

Team Pult are upset about the loss, but Melon Pult advises the team to use this loss as fuel for a victory.
The Best are thriving, except for Winter Melon, who worries one of her brothers will be eliminated so soon.
Speaking of which TIME FOR THE FIRST ELIMINATION!
Team Pult lost the challenge meaning one of them will be the first one eliminated from the show!
We got 8 votes in total, which is actually more than the first episode of BFDI, a huge thanks to everyone who voted!
The first one safe is actually a tie between Melon Pult and surprisingly Garlic, Melon is thankful for the votes and Garlic appreciates that his quest for the best stink is being respected. Cabbage Pult and Plant Pot are both safe with 1 vote. Cabbage is very grateful for the one vote while Plant Pot panics about Marigold.
Kernel Pult, Coffee Bean, Umbrella Leaf and Marigold got no votes, truly unloved, Kernel is insanely jealous his brothers got votes.
To solve this four way tie, Melon Pult will get to pick who will be eliminated due to being the first one to reach 3 votes.
Obviously, he chooses to save Kernel Pult and he might actually get killed by Plant Pot if he were to eliminate Marigold, so saves her too.
This leaves Umbrella Leaf and Coffee Bean, Umbrella Leaf‚Äôs show off attitude cost the team, but is atleast trying better than Coffee Bean, who refused to contribute?
Well according to Melon Pult the first contestant eliminated is‚Ä¶



Coffee Bean

Umbrella Leaf is insanely grateful for Melon‚Äôs mercy while Coffee Bean is disappointed. Now for the elimination, after a long pause of silence, Coffee Bean cannot even react before he is shoveled, disappearing so suddenly, no time for last words and with no fanfare, weirdly haunting, but who cares?

Time for the challenge, and I am deciding to show off my own, the challenge is to produce the most sun, the team who produces the least sun will be up for voting!
SPADOW, strategy is to hide Sunflower while she produces them sun, if anyone were to find her, they‚Äôd be doomed
For Fun Guys, despite having SUN Shroom, she actually HATES sun and refuses to produce it, even for the others, seems this team will need to find another way to gain sun
The Logs, without a way to produce sun, will have to find a way to steal it from others, much to Wall-Nut‚Äôs already tiring objections.
The Shining Stars have no way to produce sun either, BUT with Plantern and Starfruit on their team, will this light-themed duo be able to find a way to produce sun?
Team Pult, determined to not lose again, are determined to find any source of sun, where Umbrella Leaf suggests to trade the coins Marigold produces for sun at the classic ‚ÄúSun Store‚Äù
The Best are not just determined to survive but to actually win 1st place again, will this ambition cause a surprise fall of, probably not considering they have Twin Sunflower.

Now for the performances in the challenge!

The Best win the first safe because of Twin Sunflower‚Äôs efficiency in sun production, and with an intimidating enough crew to not want to be messed with, they easily earning first place!
Team Pult rise from last to second after buying an abundance of sun from the store, only being halted when Gold Magnet attempts to steal their coins, thankfully, Winter Melon looks out for her family and stops Gold Magnet‚Äôs greed, much to his annoyance.
Fun Guys find a new strategy thankfully, where is the best place to get sun? No where else BUT the sun! Using Doom Shroom as a one-time cannon, Gravebuster‚Äôs endurance snd Ice Shroom‚Äôs power management to rip parts of the sun off snd toss it down for then to use, earning them third safe!
SPADOW manages to keep Sunflower a secret, enough to earn third safe! If not for an act of generosity from Peashooter that saves another team from elimination‚Ä¶
The last team safe is‚Ä¶THE LOGS
Despite the fact they have no way to produce sun themselves, Torchwood‚Äôs popularity manages to convince SPADOW too share some sun to save them, Threepeater and Peashooter being family and all
Shining Stars sadly lose, Starfruit and Plantern may be light sources, but not sun sources, this delusion dragging out enough to result in a loss!
VOTERS!
Vote for one member of Shining Star to be safe, the person with the least votes will be eliminated from the show!

1lv3y0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1lv3y0j/trip_report_35_weeks_in_south_korea/,Trip Report - 3.5 weeks in South Korea,"**About Me** - mid-30s, male. I'm currently on my first ""summer break"" of a new teaching job, so I took the opportunity for my first longterm trip since covid ruined one back in 2020. This visit to Korea was the first ~half of the trip.

**About the Trip** - I had a non-solo commitment in Seoul, and built this trip partly around that, which is the reason for the slightly odd itinerary of starting *near* but not in Seoul and coming back to Seoul later.

**Itinerary**

**Incheon (three days)** - I started here, knowing that I'd come back to Seoul later in the trip. Catering to international tourists didn't seem to be much of a focus for Incheon, which honestly made it kind of a cool place to start, even if the language barrier was steeper than some of the other places I went, and the ensuing culture shock therefore hit a bit harder than maybe if I'd started somewhere more tourism-focused. But just wandering random neighborhoods and parks and testing out my Korean-alphabet-reading in restaurants was fun and a nice way to start things off. A highlight was Incheon Fish Market and some of the delicious seafood around there. 

**Danyang (four days)** - a small riverside town and a nice relaxing place to hang out, with a good mix of interesting sights in the area including some caves and the lovely Guinsa Temple complex. Danyang itself had some beautiful pedestrian infrastructure/pathways along the river area. However, this was the area where I struggled most as a solo diner - in the big cities it was easy enough to find restaurants friendly to solo diners, but at least in the Danyang neighborhood where I stayed, a *lot* of restaurants only served communal meals for groups and would turn me away. This was a bit frustrating at times. Still, I enjoyed my time here and had a quiet ""rest day"" here as well. Danyang does draw a lot of tourists but anecdotally it seemed like the vast majority there were domestic tourists from elsewhere in Korea (which maybe partly explains so many restaurants only serving the big communal Korean-style meals?)

**Andong (two days)** - the main ""pull"" for me here was the Hahoe Folk Village, a beautiful historic village a short bus ride away from the main city. The city of Andong itself had some fun markets which again seemed geared to a very local crowd, but otherwise wasn't a city I strongly ""clicked"" with.

**Busan (three days)** - I really loved Busan, and on a future visit I would spend more time there. Big enough to feel lively and vibrant but small enough to not feel super overwhelming, walkable, beautiful layout built into the hills/mountains, great seafood and fish market, and not too far from some nice nature/temples as well. The fish market was one major highlight and I also just really liked wandering around here, including up to some of the higher-up parts of the city for great views back over the cityscape. 

**Gyeongju (one day)** - this was a relatively last-minute edit to the plan and I just did a relatively brief stopover here for a day, but I liked it a lot, relaxing and peaceful atmosphere and some cool architecture in the historic areas. Some nice times just sitting and reading in parks here.

**Seoul (six days)** - this part was mostly non-solo, so I'll skip some of it. Of the parts I did solo, some of the markets were highlights - I always enjoy sort of cluttered and hectic markets, there's something sort of comforting to me about pandemonium. It's such a massive city though that it feels inevitable that there will be some areas you really love and others that may underwhelm or just not really ""click"" for you. Despite it being the place in Korea where I spent the most time, I don't know that I entirely have my head wrapped around Seoul.

**Jeju Island (four days)** - this was another major highlight of the trip, I loved it here. Jeju City had a nice, sleepy, relaxed feel to it (at least the areas where I stayed). Some of the coastal areas were also really beautiful and relaxing, and I hiked up Hallasan, the highest mountain in South Korea and highest I've ever hiked (on my own or otherwise). After the hike, I wanted some downtime to rest my legs, and Jeju was lovely for that as well, with some great places to sit and relax outside. A day of slowly walking along a coastal trail, sitting to read on a bench for a long time, and wandering through a small local town to a little cafe and hanging out there was probably one of the most peaceful travel days I've had anywhere. 

**Seoul again + DMZ tour (two days)** - from Jeju, I flew back to Seoul. At this point, the trip was starting to wind down, with not a ton of time left. The DMZ tour was another relatively last-minute change of plans, but I'm glad to have done it. A surreal mixture of sobering firsthand exposure to a tense border situation, history lesson on the war/armistice, and kinda weird tourist trap. But it was fascinating, and it can really make an impact to see something like that firsthand. As part of the tour, I got a look at North Korea from a distance too, probably the closest I'll ever get to NK unless if some really big regime changes happen there. Sometimes I'm wary of tours, fearful that they'll be too rushed or tiring, but the DMZ one was well-paced. At the end of the day I had dinner at a Seoul restaurant run by North Korean defectors as well.

**Incheon + Muui Island (two days)** - I wrapped things up by staying at a hotel close to the airport, but you don't have to go that far from the airport to feel like you're in a pretty different place than Seoul, with some very quiet neighborhoods a short bus ride away from the airport. And Muuido, aka Muui Island, was a nice place to spend my last day in the country - it's right next to the island where the airport is, and seems to be a bit of a getaway spot for domestic Korean tourists, with some beaches and hiking trails. Hanging out in Muuido made it sort of hard to believe that a major international airport was so close by.

**What Went Well** 

I'd say most things did! I learned to read the Korean alphabet phonetically before the trip, and that really paid off, especially in places less visited by foreign tourists. I used it more often than expected, including to order food and sometimes for reading maps and bus stops and things like that.

With the amount of time I had, I'm also really happy with the itinerary, and feel I got a good sampling of a lot of cool places. Loved the food, felt super safe the whole time, and had a lot of peaceful relaxing moments. 

I'm not a hugely social traveler, but did occasionally have nice chats with other tourists, and I'm not really a ""pushing to socialize with local people"" type of traveler either, but still had some friendly interactions including an old Korean lady randomly buying me ice cream at Guinsa temple and a nice relaxing chat with a Seoul bartender about some of his time living outside Korea before coming back. 

Also I could gush quite a bit about the convenient and frequent public transit, I loved how easy it was to get around.

I think overall my favorite places here were Busan and Jeju. 

**What didn't go well** 

There were times where I felt more self conscious about being an outsider than I usually do when traveling alone. I'm not 100% sure why that was, but maybe it's partly because Korea's a pretty homogenous place demographically-speaking and I'm more used to the US ""melting pot"" mixture of people? Plus, language barrier in some places, and maybe some social mannerism differences that it's easy to pick up on more when you're on your own.

As noted above, in Danyang especially, I sometimes had some minor frustrations finding food for a solo diner. Even then, portion sizes were often massive, so I ended up on two meals a day plus an early morning convenience-store-vending-machine coffee. I think the question of ""will this restaurant let me in as a solo diner"" did make me less adventurous about trying new foods compared to how I'd normally be, just because the priority sometimes was just finding a place that I knew would be able to serve me. During the ""non-solo"" Seoul parts of the trip I did get to thankfully experience some of the Korean communal dining culture including with some new Korean friends. 

Lastly, on this trip, there were unfortunately some days where I was ruminating on a sort of bitter social situation back home in Atlanta. All that ruminating eventually led to some helpful growth and painful but necessary conversations with that person, leading to breaking away from them completely - something I probably should've done sooner, but things had been kind of confusing, and I guess I needed the time away to think more clearly about it all. So you know, it led to useful things, but with that ruminating going on in my head sometimes, it didn't feel like as ""carefree"" a trip as some of my others have been.

**Safety** 

Safest I've ever felt on a solo trip, ever. During the ""non-solo"" part in Seoul, I walked back to my accommodations alone at very late hours of the night and felt 100% at ease and comfortable. There are very few places where I'd do something like that and feel at ease, especially alone. 

Before the trip, I'd read some warnings about traffic safety in Korea, but I honestly didn't really notice much in terms of risky driving...but maybe living in Atlanta makes me completely unfazed by reckless driving, IDK.

**A few logistical things** 

Somewhat standard Korean travel advice, but downloading Naver maps and using that instead of Google maps was definitely worthwhile. T-money cards are used for public transit and purchased and refilled (with cash, currently) in convenience stores. Many people online advised downloading the ""Kakao T"" app, a local Uber equivalent, but I ended up never using that, I just used buses and occasionally Uber itself. 

Otherwise, if there's one itinerary thing I would have changed, I'd have added more time in Jeju and picked a second location there as another home base instead of just staying in Jeju City the whole time, since the island is large enough that some parts of it are a bit tiring as just a day trip from Jeju City.

I felt exhausted, anxious, like I couldn‚Äôt do any work. I popped a  propanolol (rx for anxiety) and felt better an hour or so later. 

Today is the first time I thought to keep an eye on my HR with these symptoms but I have felt unusually run down for hours after my past few runs. I am just taking it back up so my pace is slow and I‚Äôm doing less than two miles per run. 

Last time I was running regularly was 2019, I was doing 15 miles a week and I remember this happening then too, but I attributed it to following a strict keto diet at that time. I would always feel so run down after runs, anxious, sometimes pounding heart feeling. I was 29 at this time.

-incorporated strength training 4-5 days, 30 mins a day

-walked 10k steps a day. Especially after every meal. Every day. 

-80/20 lifestyle. I allowed myself a treat fridays or sundays. A dessert or a meal or both but still ate a nutritious meal for all 3 meals. 

-i did have days were i had multiple treats or indulgences, for example. One day i had enchiladas, two donuts and fries LOL. I was frustrated at myself for a bit but moved and made sure i took 7-10 days no treats or cheat meals at all to reset

-only eat 3 meals a day no snacks. I ate my plate in order: veggies first, fat, protein then lastly carbs that consisted of mostly complex carbs but i did have bread for every lunch and dinner. Dave‚Äôs powerseed bread (the red one with only 1g sugar, can only be found at whole foods) or one mighty mill. The key is eating it w/ a fat and last thing i ate

-followed glucose goddess and never ate naked carbs or carbs without fat or protein

-tried to sleep more but honestly still working on this one 

-increased fiber intake. Veggies with every meal. At least 30g of protein every meal. Didn‚Äôt really have carbs for breakfast only veggies, protein and fat but some days i did!

-reduced sugary coffees

-went to bed hungry

1lv3rzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoCoworker/comments/1lv3rzz/single_white_female_syndrome/,Single white female syndrome,"So I started a new job 3 months ago. It‚Äôs my dream job but it started out a little rocky, my supervisor isn‚Äôt very helpful or kind and I basically had to train myself through coworkers. 


We‚Äôll call the coworker in question Alice. So Alice has the same supervisor and her office is 2 doors down from mine. Alice is super helpful and friendly, a little bit odd and definitely an over sharer, but I believe in being kind to all and so I am friendly. We get coffee occasionally, she shows me work things that are helpful. Alice starts asking frequently if I can do things outside of work, I repeatedly come up with excuses because while she is nice, she has made uncomfortable on multiple occasions. 


Examples being, her repeatedly asking if I‚Äôm bisexual, telling me I chose a stereotypical ‚Äúblack name‚Äù for my biracial son, talking about Hispanic people in a negative thoughtless way, talking about her breasts, she emotionally manipulated me into talking to her about her husband and their open marriage by implying that she might be suicidal, she had trauma dumped on me about sexual assault and intimate details about her life, basically she just says whatever comes to mind without any thought. I no longer want to be associated with her because her conversation topics are often wildly inappropriate. We work with attorneys, I don‚Äôt want someone to hear her words and report us both. I just don‚Äôt want to be associated with her. 


I start distancing myself and make a complaint with my supervisor about the sexual and prejudiced comments. This was recent so nothing has come of it yet. I continue to distance myself. 
SHE WON‚ÄôT GIVE UP! 
No matter how many times I reject her offers to hang out she continues to ask. Just today, she has asked me 4 times to grab coffee with her. When she talks to me I don‚Äôt make eye contact, I keep my body turned away from her, I give 1 word responses, I am not friendly with her anymore and yet she does not take a hint.
Also just found out she has been going around telling everyone how close we are and how much we have bonded. 


I have known this person for less than 2 months. She‚Äôs scaring me, she finds me everywhere I go, I can‚Äôt leave my office without her calling after me and sometime‚Äôs chasing me down the hall. 
I feel like the scene in The Office where Stanley‚Äôs heart rate monitor goes off whenever Michael gets near. I wake up every day and want to call in sick because she is causing me so much anxiety. 
My boyfriend suggested I send her a message on Teams at work and tell her I don‚Äôt want to be her friend but I am new here and I‚Äôm afraid it will backfire. I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings and I don‚Äôt want to be accused of bullying. I‚Äôve already gone to management and I don‚Äôt feel like this is their job. We are all adults, this shouldn‚Äôt be happening. 
I feel sick to my stomach constantly and I need advice. ",1,1752017497.0,JustNoCoworker,0,1.0,False

It's like they threw darts at a thesaurus and then made a wager as to how many times they could use ""reverberate"" and ""crescendo"" before anyone noticed. What follows are the horrid, pretentious originals and then my attempt at something a normal human being, from the planet of Earth, might actually say.

**Hell Diver 2025**

Original (gag):

>The nose is a vermillion storm cloud, echoing an ominous rumble of red velvet cake, hazelnut and brandied chocolate cherry. It looms in the glass, pulsating crimson lightning, each strike illuminates the cloud with baked brown sugar, galvanic bursts of sweetened chai, a nimbus of raspberry infused honey and cara cara marmalade. The landing is like a diving loon. Chaos above, calm below, it glides unperturbed across the palate, leaving toasted caramel in its wake and a dusting of ruby chocolate over creamy mocha. The maelstrom above displays sweet secondary earth tones, reverberating mint, camellia sinensis and vanila glace. All the while, our Hell Diver navigates the undercurrents, a spiral of strawberry conserva, canela-coated Brazil nuts and a twining of toffee. The finish approaches. The bird breaches. The storm crescendoes as its nutmeg, white tea, and French wafer coalesce. A final flush of red comice pear flashes bright before its silken descent into an everlasting swirl of maple, walnut, and cocoa powder.

Human being version:

>It smells like red velvet cake, hazelnuts, cocoa, and red fruits like cherry and raspberry. There are strong baking spices and brown sugar notes, along with some citrus. The first palate impression is of warm caramel and chocolate, some rye herbal flavors, and floral vanilla. The red fruits persist, with strawberry jam, candied nuts, and even some coffee. The baking spices also carry through from the nose, with nutmeg and light tea. On the finish, more lingering sweet fruit along with maple syrup, wood, and a whisper of chocolate.

**Peregrine 2024**

Original:

>Raspberry, nectarine, cocoa butter, magnolia blossom and honey with whisps of tantalizing toffee waft solicitously from the glass. The aromas make promises you hope the liquid can keep. The Peregrine 2024 palate does not have a distinct beginning, middle and end. Touching the glass to your lips is like plunging into a rushing river of flavor. Its crisp, bright fruit sweeps you up into a serpentine torrent of chocolatey currents, seizing the wind from your chest, strumming your heartchords with a succession of cinnamon, sugar and ripened red pear. The twisting notes of dragonfruit, molasses, and nougat are intricate and luscious, undulating from density to richness. The final crescendo of cloves, couverture chocolate and apricots crest and fall like the rush of a crashing wave skimming across a long, flat beach. As you catch your breath, each exhale echoes nutmeg and woodspice. The moment you get off the ride, you just want to strap in and take another sip.

A version not written by a hostile AI:

>On the nose you'll find raspberry, nectarine, cocoa butter, honey, and floral notes. There is also dark burned sugar, like toffee or caramel. On the palate there's immediate bright fruit, giving way to bitter chocolate and sweet cinnamon. There is carryover of the dark sugars from the nose, and you get rich molasses and candy. The chocolate note builds along with the stonefruit and baking spices, which are particularly persistent on the finish.

Alright, one more is all I can take. **Batch 010:**

Original:

>Batch 010 does not flit or faulter. It presents a balanced harmony, a chorus of integrated notes that move inexorably from nose to landing to palate to finish. The nose promises a melody of vanilla wafer, toffee and semi-sweet chocolate chips, transporting you to a Sicilian cafe serving affogato over coffee gelato. The countermelody echoes hints of plum, shortbread, rock candy and a sweet resonant whisper of orange zest. Batch 010 lands with a rumbling cinnamon sugar note, layered upon Irish buttered toast, harkening back to its Batch 005 heritage. The initial creamy texture resolves into a gripping brown sugar viscosity while the crackling wood-spiced tannin emerges towards the finish. The evolving mouthfeel mingles beautifully with notes of fat toasted marshmallow and malted chocolate cake. The lingering finish settles into your chest with spicy honey butter, perfumed mahogany and oiled cedar, before it hits a final reverberant nutmeg and mint note that plunges into the depths of your soul.

Actual living person:

>You will find that, like all whisky, this one starts with aroma, then palate, then finish, because you are a real being moving forward through spacetime, and you cannot ever experience the finish before the aroma unless you inject it straight down your esophagus via your neck. 

>This starts with a nose of vanilla, toffee, and light chocolate. A second whiff yields red and dark fruits, fruitcake, and some citrus oils. On the palate there is immediate strong cinnamon, but sweet, and toasty richness that builds to very strong brown sugar. Mouthfeel is oily and viscous, and as you swallow the wood spice and tannins emerge, along with hints of s'mores. More wood comes on the finish, with old oak but also bright cedar and piney mint, plus those baking spices that last and last.

1lv3rp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1lv3rp1/feedback_for_my_first_chapter_low_fantasy_cozy/,Feedback for my first chapter [Low fantasy/ cozy fantasy],"Hey folks, I was hoping for some feedback on my first chapter.

It's a first draft, so I'm mostly just looking for what you like/don't like and general vibes and impressions. It's about 3200 words. Thanks for reading, if you do.

Chapter One

Just because two ideas are seemingly opposed doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt both be true. For instance, Kendry‚Äôs once luscious hair was thinning and fading from its normal mossy green to gray. He once walked with vigor and intent, but now he walked in whatever way caused the least amount of pain in his joints. His body used to be toned and powerful, but now he was a little overweight and flabby. And yet, despite all those universal truths of aging, his true adventure was just beginning. 

Kendry felt a gust of wind at his back as he entered the market district of Sanara City. The capital of Eleta couldn‚Äôt be more different from Serrikai Sanctum back home on Aaru. Merchants and potential customers yelled over one another, trying to get the best deal. The air was hot, thick, and heavy. The sides of shops and taverns were caked with dirt and grime. And there were the impoverished in the streets begging for silver. Kendry grimaced, suddenly missing the quiet calm of home. 

However, Kendry tried to appreciate of the positives. He could hear jovial laughter erupting between the shouts and insults. Children played in the street, chasing one another in a competitive game of tag. The bright reds, purples, greens, and yellows of fruits and vegetables from the rich Eletan countryside sat quietly, eagerly waiting to be chosen. The sizzling of cooking meats played in the background in a juicy and savory melody, and danced with the smell of freshly baked bread. Perhaps it was not all bad. 

However, the delights and pleasures of the city would have to wait. Kendry was in Sanara city for one thing: to get information from a former pupil. And to do that, he would have to trek up to the Emerald Palace. All roads in Sanara led to the palace, but most of those roads were uphill. If only Kendry had decided to retire before age had caught up to him. He looked up to the shining peaks of the palace and took a deep breath. Another gust of wind hit his back, as if urging him to go. Kendry felt the left breast pocket in his robe where the letter sat.

""I am coming for you, Nori.‚Äù  He said to himself.

Kendry climbed past the Market district, trying hard to ignore the smells and sounds of bakeries and butcher shops despite them begging him to linger. However, slowly but surely, the aromas of meats and breads faded away and were replaced by burning leather, metal, and sweat. The sound of clanging metal echoed. Ah, the metal district, Kendry thought. Kendry couldn‚Äôt help but smile when he saw a blacksmith‚Äôs shop with several swords and blades hanging on the walls. A burly man worked the anvil in a slow, repetitive motion. Kendry counted, one, two, three, bang. One, two, three, bang. The classic Aarunian method. He was well-trained.

‚ÄúGwah, that isn‚Äôt right either!‚Äù

Kendry‚Äôs admiring was interrupted by a woman sitting on a nearby bench. She was clutching a piece of parchment and charcoal and had several others crumpled up around her. She was well-muscled and carried a sword on her hip. Her short blond hair was brushed back, letting her rosy-pale skin shine in the sun. A guardswoman, perhaps, Kendry thought.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù Kendry said with a smile.

‚ÄúOh, good morning. Sorry, I don‚Äôt have any spare silver at the moment. Hmm, but I might have some bread, give me a moment.‚Äù She began to rummage through her pack as Kendry sighed. Did he really look so transient? He supposed he had been on the road for a few weeks, and he hadn‚Äôt bathed in that time.

‚ÄúThat is okay, I have just been traveling for-‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about some blueberry goat cheese?‚Äù She pulled out a clump of white cheese dotted with purple, wrapped in a piece of cloth.

‚ÄúI could have some cheese.‚Äù Kendry graciously accepted the gift and flung a small bit of it into his mouth. It had a tangy yet earthy taste to it, and did not at all taste like a goat. Kendry was grateful for the change from his normal dried fruits and meat he prepared before he left home. The goat cheese was the most flavorful thing he had eaten since a nice lady in Portown fed him some of her sea-chicken dumpling soup. Kendry‚Äôs stomach growled. The young woman giggled.

‚ÄúI could not help but overhear, are you having an issue writing your letter?‚Äù Kendry said as warmly as he could between bites. Her face softened as she sighed.

‚ÄúOh, this is nothing you need to concern yourself over, citizen.‚Äù She crumpled up the parchment in her hand and threw it to the ground in front of her. She looked down at her feet.

‚ÄúYou know, I have written my fair share of letters in my time.‚Äù He ate another piece.

‚ÄúIt's nothing really, just a letter to my mother.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, our desire to please our parents can be strong.‚Äù He gestured to himself, ‚ÄúEven as we get older.‚Äù He let out a small chuckle. She smiled to herself.

‚ÄúNo, it's nothing like that. It's just, we fought when I took this position in the city. I just want her to know I‚Äôm safe.‚Äù She brushed a strand of her hair behind her ear. ‚ÄúIt's silly, I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúWanting to reassure a worried mother is not so silly. I have done the same in my time. Plenty of times, in fact. My mother once framed a letter I wrote to her and hung it in our home.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? What do you think I should say? I just want her to know I‚Äôm safe, I love her and-‚Äù She paused for a moment, ‚ÄúAnd that I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll pretty standard affair if I am being honest.‚Äù They shared a chuckle as he finished the last chunk of cheese. He sat beside her on the bench and handed her the cloth back. He sighed and looked up at the sky. In truth, he hadn‚Äôt thought of his parents in quite a long while. He tried to remember the letter his mother loved so much.

‚ÄúOkay, get ready.‚Äù He said. She got another sheet of parchment and prepared to write. ‚ÄúTry this. Hi Mother, I wanted to let you know that I am safe, I love you, and I am sorry. I will write again to you, assuming I have not died from being impaled by a spear. Love, Your Daughter.‚Äù Kendry smirked to himself. He nodded and smiled at the guardswoman, but she did not return it. She looked as if she had just seen a sea buffalo jump over a goliath oak in the middle of Jeeb‚Äôs desert.

‚ÄúYou are not writing it down. Did you need me to repeat it?‚Äù Kendry said.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù She let out, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to figure out how to‚Ä¶ put it in my own words.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is smart,‚Äù Kendry said with a nod.

‚ÄúWell, I should get going. My shift is about to start.‚Äù She quickly packed up and began to walk away, before turning back to Kendry. ‚ÄúThank you for your‚Ä¶help. If you go to the Cornhill Inn back in the market district, tell Henry that Marie sent you. He‚Äôll treat you right.‚Äù Before long, she disappeared into the crowds.

Kendry groaned as he rose from the bench and continued his journey to the palace. If only he had prepared his body more before he left home. Home. He would very much enjoy being on the island, enjoying a warm cup of coffee as the warmth of the sunrise washed over him. Watching the mist roll over the luscious hillside and the pampas grass sway in the wind. He could take a deep breath of the cool and crisp island air. Instead, he was climbing up a hill as the unrelenting sun shone down on him.

His forehead was slick with sweat and began to feel like leather. Kendry thought it might be a good time for a brief respite in some shade. He found a white dogwood tree with plenty of protection from the cloudless sky. As he approached, he noticed a Jeebist Monk meditating under the tree. His cool midnight dark skin was a stark contrast to the pure white robes that clunge to his thin frame. They sat with their legs crossed and their eyes closed.

Kendry always enjoyed the monks from Jeeb. They were known for their calm minds and affinity for helping others. They were also known for their deep meditations that could last days. Kendry wondered what had prompted this monk to meditate here, in the middle of a busy city far from home.

Whatever the reason, Kendry thought it best not to disturb them. Many of the world‚Äôs greatest philosophies and theories on human nature came from meditating Jeebist monks. And Kendry did not want to be a distraction to whatever secret of the universe this monk was unraveling. Instead, he quietly took a seat next to them in the shade of the tree. Kendry closed his eyes, inhaled deeply, and then exhaled to relax his body and slow his thoughts.

He let his mind wander. First, to the soft chirps of small birds, then to the shuffling of the city. Then he imagined the great lake that Sanara City sat on and its cool and deep waters. The image of farmers working the rich Eletan countryside rose. Then he remembered the many white marble temples and ruins that dotted the country, revealing a pious origin. Which of the prime gods of Alk-Hemia did Eleta rever most again? That‚Äôs right, it was Saa, the prime god of Fire, and Sool, the prime god of the earth. A combination that revealed a love of the hearth, small comforts, hard work, and piety of the highest order.

The sound of growling interrupted Kendry‚Äôs meditation. Kendry opened his eyes to see the monk‚Äôs head tilting back and his mouth hanging open. To Kendry‚Äôs surprise, the growling was coming from the monk. If Kendry hadn‚Äôt known any better, he would have said the Monk had fallen asleep and was snoring. However, Kendry did know better. This must be some new advanced form of mediation. Perhaps one that takes the meditator back to a primal stage of being. That seemed much more likely and something Kendry did not want to disturb. So Kendry gently rose to his feet and bowed deeply to the monk. As he walked away, the monk let out another, even more ferocious sound from deep within their body.

Kendry continued his ascent to Emerald Castle. While struggling up the hill, he discovered he had reached the famed marble district. Four temples to the Prime Gods of Alk-Hemia watched over the city streets like sentinels. Each white marble temple had an intricately carved pediment chronicling the creation of the world. Kendry himself never put much stock in the gods, but treated them with respect, just in case.

By the entrance of each temple were priests and priestesses offering religious charms, effigies, and tokens to pilgrims. Kendry was drawn to the temple of Saa, the prime god of Fire. A priestess was tending to several effigies of the many gods under the Saa discipline. It had been a while since Kendry had tried to name them, and he thought it would be fun to see what he remembered. Tuutor, the sun god, was easy because he was always depicted carrying the sun on his back like a pack swung over his shoulder. Of course, Voe, the goddess of lanterns, was easy to pick out with her four arms, each carrying a different styled lantern. Then there was‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHello, there.‚Äù A crackly voice echoed.

Kendry looked up from the tiny god statues to see the age-worn face of an elderly priestess smiling eagerly at him. Her skin was sun-baked and wrinkled, and her hair had long lost its original color. But her bright brown eyes were youthful and gentle and matched the color of her robes.

‚ÄúOh, hello, Priestess.‚Äù He bowed respectfully.

‚ÄúLooking for anything in particular? We have something for most of the gods under Saa‚Äôs domain. Perhaps you are looking for something to watch over your grandchildren?‚Äù She eagerly turned before Kendry could protest. She brought back a miniature figure carved from wood. It was in the shape of a child, holding a basket of flowers.

‚ÄúParnukle, the ever-young goddess of children, protects her flock from evils and bad luck.‚Äù She held up the figure to him expectedly, eyes alight with delight.

‚ÄúOh, no, thank you. I do not have any grandchildren.‚Äù He said, holding back any hints of melancholy.

‚ÄúNot a problem, something for you then? Oh, I have just the-‚Äù She again, shuffled off before Kendry could say a word, and just as quickly as she left, she returned with a new effigy for Kendry.

‚ÄúHere, this one is perfect for someone like you. It's a marble carving of Filuka, the god of loving passion. It will help you perform for that special lady in your life.‚Äù She placed the figure in Kendry‚Äôs hands. It was a muscular man, fully naked and he was flaunting a very large penis. Kendry felt uncomfortable and wasn‚Äôt quite sure how to hold the religious relic. He opted for holding it by its head as he placed it back on the table.

The priestess rubbed her chin in thought, no doubt trying to break the code on the Aarunian elder that stood in front of her. Kendry did his best to appear content and happy, hoping she would relent.

‚ÄúAh, that‚Äôs it!‚Äù She ignored him. This time, she returned with a book, which Kendry did not expect. She held it in front of Kendry in her hands, almost begging him to take it. Kendry obliged and read the front of it out loud.

‚ÄúFamilies and Smaller Comforts.‚Äù Kendry sighed and gave a melancholic smile to the priestess. She returned it with a satisfying nod. ‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúNo, no, no. You take it. Sometimes we don‚Äôt need relics and effigies. Sometimes we just need to remember the words.‚Äù She smiled knowingly at him and promptly shooed him away. ‚ÄúNow go, I have others I must serve.‚Äù She turned Kendry‚Äôs shoulders away, swaying him forward away from her.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Kendry said. But she was already helping another pilgrim. He put the book in his bag and flung it over his shoulder as he shook his head and chuckled to himself. He took a deep breath and continued past the other temples. He made sure to avoid eye contact with the other priests and priestesses this time.

Finally, Kendry was at the gates of the Emerald Palace. Five guards stood in front of a massive portcullis, holding sentry. They had spears and short swords on their hips. They wore freshly waxed steel plate armor that shone in the sunlight. Kendry could also see, maybe twenty or so crossbowmen on the surrounding battlements. Behind the portcullis, Kendry could also see sentries lined up to the palace‚Äô grand doors. Kendry didn‚Äôt know that Eleta took security so seriously, especially in a time of peace. Perhaps there was something Kendry didn‚Äôt know.

‚ÄúStop right there, citizen. This is the Emerald Palace. The Marble District is back down the road. They can get you some new clothes and some food.‚Äù Again, Kendry had only been traveling a few weeks, but did he really look so weathered?

‚ÄúI am here to see Heinrich, if you please.‚Äù Kendry stood firm. The guards all looked at each other, confused. Then laughter erupted from them, echoing between the battlements.

‚ÄúGet out of here, old man. The King of Eleta would not see the likes of you.‚Äù The one in the center said coldly. The guardsman had gray stubble and thinning light blonde hair. Kendry thought that he must be the leader of this bunch.

‚ÄúI am afraid I must insist. May you please take me to see Heinrich?‚Äù Kendry reaffirmed.

‚ÄúInsist on this.‚Äù A guard to the right gave a hard poke with the blunt end of his spear to Kendry‚Äôs belly, knocking him slightly away. Kendry did not expect them to act in such a manner. It was unsightly for the guards of Heinrich to be this way. He would have to remind Heinrich of this once he saw him.

‚ÄúI would ask that you do not do that. I would not want to hurt you if you attempted to hit me again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho do you think you are, old man?‚Äù The leader snarled. He nodded to his man on the right. The guard went to hit Kendry again. Kendry put his weight into his right leg and pushed off, side-stepping the thrust. The guard‚Äôs stunned look quickly faded to anger as he thrusted again. This time, Kendry side-stepped, while gripping the shaft of the spear, pulling it away from the guard. He spun the spear around and faced the tip of it at the young guard's neck.

Kendry smiled softly and dropped the spear to the ground.

‚ÄúAs I have said, I do not wish to hurt anyone. I would just like to-‚Äù

Another thrust came from the left of Kendry, which he dodged by ducking underneath it. Before Kendry could say anything more, the rest of the guards attacked him. Kendry dodged several thrusts, disarming each guard, one by one, the sound of metal on stone as the spears fell to the ground. He could hear the shuffling of men coming down the marble stairs from the battlements.

Each guard pulled out their swords and pointed them at Kendry as they circled him. Kendry focused on slowing down his breath and looked each one of them in the eye. Other than the leader, each guard was a young man just following their elder‚Äôs command. Shame on the elder for being a bad influence.

They attacked in unison, just as Kendry expected. He easily dodged by sliding underneath them, tripping one of the guards as he went. He then leg swept each of the young guards to the ground, causing each of them to drop their swords. The elder came in strong. He was more skilled than the rest, but he was nothing. The man swung and slashed. Each, finding nothing but air. Finally, Kendry twirled around a thrust, taking the sword away from him. Kendry spun and held the sword to the man‚Äôs throat.

He paused and looked around. The crossbowmen had encircled them and had their bows pointed at Kendry. Kendry let the sword fall to the ground and went to his knees in a meditative form. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He heard the elder guard get up and reclaim his sword.

‚ÄúBe sure this one goes to the dungeon immediately. And I want a guard posted at his cell at all hours. Do you understand?‚Äù

The four other guardsmen forced Kendry‚Äôs hands behind his back and began tying them with rope. The lifted Kendry to his feet and began to walk him towards the portcullis.

‚ÄúIf you will not let me see Heinrich, inform Philepe that an old friend awaits him.‚Äù",1,1752017475.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False

‚òÄÔ∏è Early Bird Energy
Woke up at 5 AM ‚Äî look at me pretending to be a functioning adult again. It actually feels amazing to have my mornings back. I had enough time to get the ball rolling, get my coffee going, and get set up on the laptop without feeling like I‚Äôm sprinting out of bed straight into a ticket fire.

üíº Work Vibes & Big Fish News
Work itself was pretty normal ‚Äî a few hours of TV-watching and helpdesk babysitting while waiting for something to break (classic). The highlight was a meeting with someone three fish higher than me ‚Äî you know, if my boss is a goldfish, this guy‚Äôs basically a tuna.

Turns out our company‚Äôs growth plans are way bigger than I thought. I figured we‚Äôd hit 10k people, but we‚Äôre actually on track for 15k and about $4 billion in market value. Not quite double what I guessed but still massive. Makes me feel like if I just keep my head down and do good work for the next few months, I‚Äôll be sitting pretty ‚Äî and moving to my ‚Äúmiddle-of-nowhere‚Äù dreamland at the end of the year with job security locked in. Win-win.

üöó Produce Patch Patrol
After work, the lady wanted to stock up, so we did a little road trip to the Produce Patch in Troy ‚Äî about an hour round-trip. I didn‚Äôt even go inside because that‚Äôs her domain. I‚Äôm basically a shopping cart with a driver‚Äôs license: drop her off, park, chill in the car, victory. Grabbed a few extra bits at our local Walmart too ‚Äî plus I scored a $20 box fan for the garage so I don‚Äôt have to keep moving fans around. Living that high-roller life.

ü§∏ New Cardio Toy
I also kicked off my latest attempt at being less squishy: bouncing on a rebounder. It‚Äôs honestly kinda fun. My legs felt like jello after just three minutes yesterday, so today‚Äôs goal is a solid five. Slow and steady ‚Äî got plenty of time to build it up. If you need me, I‚Äôll be over here gently pogo-sticking my way to better health.

üóìÔ∏è Streak‚Äôs Over, But Not Really
One tiny sad note ‚Äî I lost my daily Reddit streak on the 4th of July (RIP streak #31). I‚Äôm like 2/10 disappointed ‚Äî it‚Äôs fine. The real win is that these daily posts have become my personal life journal. Gonna bounce right back and aim for the full year.

1lv3kok,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1lv3kok/seeking_diagnosis_trouble_with_psychiatrist/,Seeking diagnosis (trouble with psychiatrist previously),"Basically I am seeking a diagnosis, I have a strong suspicion I am autistic and have ADHD. Today I saw a tik tok, this guy was giving advice to business people and he said ""hire the most autistic person you know, I'm talking about the dude who goes non-verbal when there's more than 3 people"". I thought it was funny but it sounded like exactly what recently happened at a work party, basically once all my coworkers got there I got overstimulated, stopped talking and left. 

I asked my AI ""what does it mean when you go non-verbal when there's three people etc"" and it said it could be related to autism, and social anxiety. I basically said ""wouldn't I know if I had autism though?"" And it basically said it can go undiagnosed so I asked it examples of autistic patterns etc. I told it I'm ""kind of autistic"" cause I'm make and like ""things more than people"" (I watched a video of psychologist talking about how males can have autistic tendencies). I said I am ""kind of autistic with certain topics""

And it info dumped on me and talked about social norms, over stimulation, special interests, eye contact. And I realized I related to a lot of what it was talking about. Especially the special interests, monologuing, eye contact (I either avoid or hyper focus and stare then down) it also said ADHD and Autism are common. 

I would say my special interests are: psychology, philosophy, spirituality, evolutionary mating, and music (rap, singing, I'm learning production). 

The AI was saying special interests are super important to autistic people and helps them cope with reality as well as are a part of their identity etc. It also said special interests are prolonged and can last year's. I've been into all these things for 6 years or more! 

I have a very strong feeling I am ADHD because I grew up getting in trouble for all the stereotypical ADHD things, like bouncing off the walls, talking in class, drawing while the teacher is talking, getting up all the time etc. My Dad says he is ADHD and has helped me manage mine, he self medicates with absurd amounts of coffee (just like me lol). At one point all my teachers were demanding I get on meds and one teacher told my mom ""there's something wrond with your son"". My parents say me down and asked me if I wanted to get on meds and I said no. 

Recently I brought up my ADHD to my psychiatrist and then the attending psychiatrist shot it down and dismissed it stating I have ""ADHD like symptoms"" because of Bipolar 1. (Even though she never gave me the floor to explain all the evidence of my childhood). So I am hesitant to bring up Autism and ADHD cause I am afraid of getting shot down and dismissed again. I definitely KNOW I have ADHD, I don't need a test but it'd be validating. Autism sounds like me but I haven't researched it much outside today. I took a Autism screening test the ""Autism quotient test"" and scored high like 22, it says there's a high probability I have autism and I should seek a formal assessment.

I was never on ADHD meds, but I‚Äôve started my day with a cup of coffee and 200 MGs of L-theanine for over a year and it was actually fantastic. 

Just like everyone else, I‚Äôve read way more about the struggles people have taking atomoxetine vs. the positives. I asked my psych about sticking with L-theanine when I take my morning dose. She didn‚Äôt really have much for me besides ‚Äúgive it a shot‚Äù. 

Welp, I can safely say that every single horror story and side effect that seemed debilitating or incredibly difficult to manage NEVER CAME to fruition. Eating is the only struggle but weed helps (that‚Äôs a battle for another time). I find myself compartmentalizing and having an easier time receiving the environment around me.  

I have natural motivation, so to feel the overwhelm of everyday tasks melt away and be replaced with excitement and consistency has been huge. My workouts are also way more productive (L-theanine is a great workout supplement if managed correctly). 

Curious if anyone else has tried this combo and what your experiences are? 

I‚Äôm not a doctor but maybe this info will help someone. 

*Also, I read a lot about people who think their motivation will just exist once they start taking the meds. Remember, you still gotta do the work internally, but, from my experience, the meds make it all that much more attainable for us ADHDers.

**When**: July 2025

**Length of Stay**: 3 Nights

**Booking Method**: FSPP



**Room**

I originally booked the base-level room and was upgraded to a Four Seasons Executive Suite, which was fantastic. As others have said before - US downtown Four Seasons (excluding New York) are pretty generous! We had initially requested a rollaway bed for the Deluxe Room, but the suite came with a pull-out couch instead. Tip: I asked housekeeping to add a mattress cover to the pull-out, and according to my friend, it made a big difference in comfort. We noted our 10 a.m. arrival time to the hotel in advance, and to my surprise, the room was ready when we got there.

**Spa, Pool, and Fitness Center**

I had a One Dalton Massage, and it was hands down the best massage I‚Äôve ever had. There‚Äôs also a steam room and sauna available even if you‚Äôre not booked for a spa service. The indoor pool was great, and the fitness center had fantastic views. I especially appreciated the small touches like water and towels stocked right on the equipment (at first, I thought someone left their dirty towel and half-drunken water üòÇ).

**Service**

All of the staff were friendly and eager to help. The bell staff especially stood out. They were well staffed (which always makes a huge difference) and consistently greeted us with a smile.

**Dining**

We had breakfast daily at One+One, which was excellent. The staff was wonderful and the food was delicious. On Sunday, breakfast shifts to a buffet-only setup until 10 a.m., followed by a brunch buffet until 2 p.m. It included typical buffet options, but oddly, no drinks other than water, black coffee, or tea were included. Although we had ‚Äúincluded‚Äù breakfast via a $100 daily credit, the $55 buffet did not cover any specialty drinks. Even just one glass of juice would have been nice. Unfortunately we did not try the lobby bar or Zuma, the hotel‚Äôs signature Japanese restaurant.

**Overall**

I would highly recommend FS One Dalton to everyone! It‚Äôs about a 15-minute walk to Fenway Park, which is perfect if you‚Äôre catching a game. Some say the location isn‚Äôt ideal, but I had no complaints. Yes, you‚Äôll need to take the T to get to the harbor, but that didn‚Äôt bother me at all.

I'll be traveling to Paris in a few months and I would like to get around on my rollerblades as much as possible. It seems like there is a great scene around rollerblading in Paris from informal skating at Place du Palais Royal, and weekly group skates with Pari Roller and Sunday Skate, as well as being a fun and quick way to get around the city.

However I wanted to see if there was any etiquette with rollerblades when going into businesses, getting coffee at a cafe, and moving through some of the outdoor malls around town. I planned on bringing a small backpack with me that I could carry a pair of shoes so I could switch off the blades for longer stays in museums and restaurants, but I wanted to see if that was also necessary for quicker stops as well, like grabbing a coffee or a snack at a bakery.

I feel like this would be different business to business, just like it is here in the states, but I wanted to check and see if anyone here had any experience with this in the city.

A few months ago, we took in a 7-year-old boy‚Äîwe‚Äôll call him Ed. At first, it was supposed to be short-term, but it's quietly turned permanent. My dad won‚Äôt tell me why. Ed is a quiet, intense kid, very smart, very serious, always observing everything. He‚Äôs... a lot. But generally helpful and polite.

The thing is, I don‚Äôt know anything about his family. He‚Äôs never mentioned his parents. Then, one day, a woman showed up saying she was his mom. She was dressed in this very professional, expensive-looking outfit, picked him up without any real conversation, and left. No crying, no fuss. Just gone. Five hours later, she brought him back, said some vague thing to my dad like, ‚ÄúHe belongs here for now,‚Äù handed him what looked like a check, and left. Since then, nothing. No calls, no visits, no updates.

Ed came back and acted like *nothing had happened.*

Lately, though, there‚Äôs something else that‚Äôs been bothering me. Ed gets extremely weird whenever I talk to guys. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be romantic. If I say hi to someone at school and he‚Äôs nearby, he‚Äôll just stare at them until they walk away. He never *says* anything, but it‚Äôs this quiet, analyzing kind of stare, like he‚Äôs profiling them.

It gets worse when I mention Sam (18M), my childhood best friend. Sam‚Äôs been traveling a lot lately for work, so we haven‚Äôt seen much of each other, but Ed *hates* him. I don‚Äôt know why. The last time I said I was texting Sam, Ed looked like I‚Äôd told him the world was ending. And when I casually mentioned I might see Sam over the weekend, he went stiff and didn‚Äôt talk to me for the rest of the day.

A few Sundays ago, I was planning to meet someone-someone very important to me, but not romantically. It was my mom. We‚Äôve been working on repairing our relationship, and she wanted to have lunch together in private. I didn‚Äôt want to get into it with Ed because whenever I leave the house, he asks *where*, *why*, *with whom*, *for how long*, like he‚Äôs my parent. So when he caught me on the way out and asked where I was going, I panicked and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm meeting Sam for a date.‚Äù

I thought that would end the questions. Big mistake.

First, he got weirdly quiet. Then I saw his expression shift‚Äîlike, three different expressions in a minute. Excitement, confusion, then just‚Ä¶ something like anger. Not a tantrum. Just this deeply disapproving frown. I told him to enjoy the day and left.

When I got to the caf√©, *he was already there*.

I have no idea how he followed me. I didn‚Äôt even tell him where I was going. But there he was, sitting at a table like he‚Äôd just dropped in for coffee. He said he ‚Äúfigured it out.‚Äù I told him I was just meeting ‚Äúsomeone important‚Äù and that I‚Äôd be back in a few minutes, and went to the bakery next door to pick up a cake. When I came back‚Ä¶

He was sitting with my mom. Chatting. Like they knew each other.

I pulled her aside afterward and asked if she‚Äôd met him before. She said no, but that he introduced himself politely and seemed ‚Äúmature for his age.‚Äù

Later that night, he casually dropped a comment about how Sam ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt actually in town‚Äù that weekend. I asked how he knew, and he just said, ‚ÄúI checked.‚Äù

He‚Äôs seven.

Since then, I‚Äôve started noticing more things. Like how he calls me by my full name even when no one else is around. Or how he acts like I‚Äôm *his* responsibility. He listens at doors. He finishes my dad‚Äôs sentences. My dad doesn‚Äôt seem to notice, or maybe he does and just isn‚Äôt worried. But it‚Äôs gotten under my skin.

When I told a friend what happened, she said I shouldn‚Äôt have lied to him about who I was meeting, because he‚Äôs dealing with abandonment issues. Maybe he sees me as a stable adult figure, and that I shouldn‚Äôt make him feel unsafe. But I didn‚Äôt lie to hurt him. I just wanted *one* lunch without a kid playing twenty questions about my personal life.

So... AITA for lying about who I was seeing so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with Ed‚Äôs questions?

**TL;DR:** A child living with us is becoming overly involved in my personal life, particularly when it comes to my male friends. I lied about who I was meeting to avoid being interrogated, and it backfired spectacularly. AITA?",0,1752016130.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False
