So, I started building [Locago](https://WWW.Locago.app)\--a site to shop by product across stores near you (think Etsy, but IRL with in-store pickup). Need a last minute gift to bring to a friend's dinner party? See what candles, coffee books, and cheese boards are available at the small stores on your way. Want to find a red dress with a new pair of heels before that office holiday party this weekend? See what's in stock across all the stores in \[insert neighborhood\]. You can view what's in store, place the order, and have 5 days to pick up your order.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I've heard about the coffee shop idea but that's not an accessible option for me at this time, so I've stuck to using video games that let you name your player character to see how I feel about them. Of course, it turns out I like these names about equally.

If anyone here has faced the same dilemma, how did you make it easier to pick one or how would you recommend settling on one?

1h514c4,https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/1h514c4/giving_feedback_on_a_coach/,Giving feedback on a coach ,"I‚Äôm a member, been doing CrossFit on and off for about a decade. My gym has one coach who really isn‚Äôt my style - kind of tough love, macho, barking instructions. I used to avoid his classes and then at some point he stopped coaching at our gym and just was doing PT. He‚Äôs back covering some classes while regular coaches are busy during the holidays. So I get that the owners likely are in a tight spot. 

I‚Äôm debating whether to ask the owners what his schedule is so I can work around it because what‚Äôs bugging me is just personal preference, vs giving direct feedback. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen:
- today we had 20 mins warm up to heavy deadlifts. There were a number of beginner/novices in the class. At min 15 I looked around, he was nowhere to be seen. I did a lift that was too heavy, fucked it up and was hurting a bit, so I was looking for him to ask for advice. Nowhere. When the buzzer went off at min 20 to get ready for the metcon, he reappeared. 
- during the metcon he wasn‚Äôt anywhere to be seen and some of the newbies were really struggling - a lot of standing around looking miserable and likely could‚Äôve used some scaling alternatives or at least some encouragement. He came back in with a min or two to go and talked to one of the newbies but other than that, zero engagement or presence during the metcon.
- he had left his coffee open resting on a set of plates, and apparently someone had spilled it, picked it up and replaced it without saying anything. He loudly asked the class repeatedly who had done it without saying anything, and when the person put up their hand, not only did he shame her pretty publicly for not saying anything there in the moment, he did it again publicly at the end of class too. You could hear a joking tone in his voice, but it seemed like a dick move to distract from him leaving an open coffee cup resting on equipment that ppl were using - plus if I was that newbie, I‚Äôd feel pretty shitty. 
- couple of people were late to class (8:02-3 arrival to an 8am class) Our gym doesn‚Äôt have a hard and fast late policy - newbies are taught to get themselves warmed up with burpees because they‚Äôre quiet, but for the most part it‚Äôs respected that folks juggle life to get to the gym, and nobody is called out publicly for being late. This coach this morning went on a rant about how he expected people to do burpees for being late, but nobody would do them because it wasn‚Äôt the policy here. I‚Äôm paraphrasing, but you get the gist. 


Ok so this is one class, it‚Äôs pretty typical of this coach. The first two feel like specific things that need improving. The second two feel like they‚Äôre more a personal style - they feel shitty to me and it‚Äôs not what I like; but maybe others do. 

So what would you do? Ask the owner for his schedule so you can work around his classes bc he isn‚Äôt your style? Or give the specific feedback. ",2,1733162236.0,crossfit,2,1.0,False

The morning sun cast a golden hue over New Avalon, its rays piercing through the gaps between towering skyscrapers. Ethan, Mara, and Lucien sat in a quiet caf√© nestled in a secluded corner of the city. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the soft hum of conversations around them.

A news bulletin played on a holo-screen above the counter:

*""Breaking News: A security breach at the Central Intelligence Tower has led to revelations about a clandestine project involving resurrection technology. Public opinion is divided as citizens grapple with the ethical implications...""*

Ethan sipped his coffee thoughtfully. ""It's begun. The world's finding out.""

Mara nodded. ""We've set the stage for a global conversation. Now we need to steer it in the right direction.""

Lucien leaned forward. ""The Continuum will try to control the narrative. They'll paint us as saboteurs trying to halt human advancement.""

""Which is why we need allies,"" Mara said. ""People who can influence public opinion and advocate for responsible use of the technology.""

Ethan tapped his fingers on the table. ""I might know someone‚ÄîDr. Aisha Kumar. She's a renowned ethicist and has a significant following. If we can get her on board, she could help sway the public discourse.""

""Do you trust her?"" Lucien asked.

""She's always been a voice of reason,"" Ethan replied. ""If anyone can present a balanced view, it's her.""

""Then we should meet her as soon as possible,"" Mara agreed.

They decided to split up to minimize detection. Ethan would approach Dr. Kumar, while Mara and Lucien would work on gathering more information about The Continuum's next moves.

Ethan made his way to the University District, where Dr. Kumar taught ethical philosophy. The campus was abuzz with students debating the latest news, their voices a mix of excitement and apprehension.

He found Dr. Kumar in her office, a spacious room filled with books and digital archives. Sunlight streamed through large windows, illuminating her as she reviewed articles projected on a holo-screen.

""Dr. Kumar,"" Ethan greeted, standing at the doorway.

She looked up, adjusting her glasses. ""Ethan Walker. It's been a while since you visited. Come in.""

He entered, closing the door behind him. ""I need to talk to you about the resurrection technology that's been leaked.""

She studied him carefully. ""I had a feeling you'd be involved somehow. You've always had a knack for being at the center of significant events.""

He smiled wryly. ""It's more of a curse than a blessing these days.""

She gestured for him to sit. ""Tell me what's on your mind.""

Ethan took a deep breath. ""The situation is more complex than the media portrays. There's a faction pushing to deploy this technology without considering the consequences. I believe we need a global dialogue to decide how‚Äîor if‚Äîit should be used.""

Dr. Kumar leaned back in her chair. ""And you want me to help facilitate this dialogue?""

""Yes. Your voice carries weight. People respect your insights on ethical matters. If you could advocate for a measured approach, it might prevent rash decisions.""

She regarded him thoughtfully. ""Ethan, meddling with life and death challenges the very foundations of our society. Resurrection technology could upend economies, social structures, even our understanding of identity.""

""I understand,"" he said earnestly. ""That's why it's crucial we handle this responsibly.""

She nodded slowly. ""Alright. I'll do what I can. But I'll need all the information you have to make a compelling case.""

He hesitated. ""Some of it is sensitive.""

""If you want my help, I need the full picture,"" she insisted.

Ethan considered her request. Trust was a scarce commodity, but without transparency, their efforts would be undermined. ""Okay. I'll tell you everything.""

Meanwhile, Mara and Lucien navigated the undercurrents of the city, seeking information from contacts within The Continuum. They met with Elena, a former member who had distanced herself from the group's more radical elements.

""I've heard whispers,"" Elena said, her eyes scanning their surroundings. ""Serena is planning to initiate a controlled demonstration of the resurrection technology to sway public opinion.""

Lucien frowned. ""What kind of demonstration?""

""Bringing back a prominent figure‚Äîsomeone beloved by the masses. If successful, it could generate overwhelming support for unrestricted use.""

Mara exchanged a glance with Lucien. ""Do you know who they're targeting?""

Elena lowered her voice. ""A global humanitarian leader who died five years ago‚ÄîDaniel Park.""

Mara's eyes widened. ""Reviving him would cause a massive surge in public favor.""

""Exactly,"" Elena confirmed. ""And once public sentiment shifts, it'll be nearly impossible to advocate for caution.""

Lucien clenched his jaw. ""We need to prevent this from happening.""

Elena shook her head. ""It might be too late. Preparations are already underway. The event is scheduled for tomorrow at a secret facility.""

""Can you get us the location?"" Mara asked urgently.

""I can try,"" Elena said. ""But it'll be heavily guarded.""

""Thank you,"" Mara said sincerely. ""Any help you can provide is invaluable.""

As they parted ways, Mara turned to Lucien. ""We need to inform Ethan and figure out a plan.""

He nodded. ""Time is against us, but we can't let The Continuum manipulate the narrative.""

Back at the university, Ethan finished briefing Dr. Kumar on the situation.

She sat silently for a moment. ""This is more serious than I imagined.""

""Will you help us?"" he asked.

She met his gaze. ""Yes. I'll start by publishing an open letter calling for international oversight and ethical guidelines. We'll need to rally other thought leaders as well.""

Ethan felt a surge of relief. ""Thank you.""

Just then, his communicator buzzed. It was Mara. ""We have a problem,"" she said quickly. ""The Continuum plans to resurrect Daniel Park tomorrow.""

Ethan's eyes widened. ""That could tip the scales entirely.""

""Exactly. We need to stop it.""

He turned to Dr. Kumar. ""They‚Äôre accelerating their plans. We have to act fast.""

She stood up. ""I'll convene an emergency symposium tonight. We'll gather experts, policymakers, and media representatives. If we can present our concerns before the demonstration, we might influence public perception.""

Ethan nodded. ""I'll help coordinate.""

He relayed the plan to Mara. ""Dr. Kumar is organizing a symposium. If we can get the word out, it might counteract The Continuum's demonstration.""

Mara sounded uncertain. ""It's a start, but Serena's move is bold. Public sentiment might still favor them.""

""Do you have the location of the event?"" he asked.

""Not yet, but we're working on it.""

""Keep me updated. We need all angles covered.""

The symposium was held in the Grand Hall of the university, a vast space adorned with symbols of human achievement. As evening fell, the hall filled with scholars, journalists, and officials, all buzzing with curiosity and concern.

Dr. Kumar took the stage. ""Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads in human history. Recent developments have unveiled technologies that challenge our fundamental understanding of life and death. It is imperative that we, as a global community, deliberate on the ethical, social, and existential implications.""

She presented a balanced overview, emphasizing the potential benefits while highlighting the risks. Other experts spoke, each adding layers to the complex tapestry of considerations.

Ethan watched from the sidelines, hopeful that reason would prevail. His communicator vibrated‚ÄîMara again.

""We have the location,"" she whispered. ""An abandoned aerospace facility on the outskirts.""

""Can you stop them?"" he asked.

""We're assembling a team, but security is tight. We might need reinforcements.""

Ethan made a decision. ""I'll bring help.""

He approached Dr. Kumar as she stepped off the stage. ""We need to go. The Continuum's demonstration is imminent.""

She nodded. ""I'll come with you. My presence might lend credibility if we confront them.""

Together, they gathered a small group of symposium attendees willing to take action‚Äîindividuals with various expertise, from cybersecurity to diplomacy.

As they departed, news outlets began broadcasting segments from the symposium, spreading the call for cautious deliberation.

Under the cover of night, they arrived at the aerospace facility‚Äîa sprawling complex surrounded by high fences and guarded by patrols.

Mara and Lucien met them near a breach in the perimeter fence.

""Glad you could make it,"" Mara said.

Dr. Kumar surveyed the group. ""What's the plan?""

Lucien outlined the situation. ""We need to infiltrate the facility, reach the central chamber where the demonstration will occur, and either halt the process or present a compelling case to delay it.""

Ethan frowned. ""Confronting them directly could be dangerous.""

Dr. Kumar stepped forward. ""We should attempt dialogue first. If we can appeal to their reason‚Äîor at least create enough doubt‚Äîwe might prevent the immediate demonstration.""

Mara agreed. ""Serena respects intellectual discourse. It's worth trying.""

They split into teams. One would create distractions to draw away the guards, while the main group headed toward the central chamber.

Inside, the facility was a maze of dark corridors and dormant machinery. The hum of generators guided them deeper until they reached a large hall illuminated by a ring of lights.

At the center stood Serena and her inner circle, gathered around a platform where intricate equipment surrounded a translucent chamber.

Serena noticed their approach. ""Ah, our dissenting friends have arrived.""

Dr. Kumar stepped forward. ""Serena, please reconsider. The implications of this act are far-reaching and potentially irreversible.""

Serena's eyes flickered with recognition. ""Dr. Kumar. Your reputation precedes you. But we cannot halt progress based on fear.""

""It's not fear,"" Dr. Kumar countered. ""It's responsibility. The societal impact of resurrecting Daniel Park without global consent could lead to chaos.""

Serena gestured to the chamber. ""Imagine the hope his return would inspire. The unity it could bring.""

Ethan spoke up. ""Or the division. Not everyone will accept this. We risk tearing the fabric of society apart.""

Mara added, ""We propose a moratorium. Let's engage the world in this decision.""

Serena's expression hardened. ""We've spent too long waiting for consensus that never comes. Visionaries must lead the way.""

Dr. Kumar's tone softened. ""True leadership involves bringing people together, not forcing their hand.""

A tense silence settled. The hum of the machinery grew louder, signaling the imminent activation of the process.

Suddenly, Lucien stepped beside Serena. ""She's right, Serena. This isn't the way.""

Serena looked genuinely pained. ""Lucien, you of all people should understand.""

""I do,"" he said gently. ""But we must guide humanity, not control it.""

Her gaze wavered. ""It's too late. The sequence has begun.""

Ethan glanced at the control panel. Lights flashed in a rapid sequence. ""Is there a way to abort?""

Serena hesitated. ""Only from the primary console.""

""Then let us stop it,"" Mara urged.

Before Serena could respond, a loud crash echoed through the hall. Security forces burst in‚ÄîMercer's team, accompanied by official authorities.

""Stand down!"" a commanding voice ordered.

Chaos erupted. Guards scrambled, and The Continuum members moved to protect the chamber.

Mercer strode forward, his eyes locking onto Ethan. ""I should have known you'd be here.""

""Dr. Mercer, we can still stop this,"" Ethan pleaded.

He shook his head. ""No. It's out of our hands now.""

In the confusion, Serena made a decision. She moved to the console and initiated the shutdown sequence.

""Serena, what are you doing?"" one of her followers exclaimed.

She looked at Lucien and then at the others. ""Perhaps they are right. Perhaps forcing this upon the world is not the answer.""

The machinery slowed, the lights dimming.

Mercer signaled his team. ""Secure the area. Detain all Continuum members.""

As guards moved to apprehend them, Serena raised her hands in surrender. ""We won't resist.""

Ethan felt a mixture of relief and uncertainty. ""What happens now?""

Mercer approached him. ""Now, we take control of the technology and ensure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.""

Dr. Kumar stepped between them. ""With all due respect, Dr. Mercer, unilateral control isn't the solution. We need transparent, international oversight.""

He eyed her skeptically. ""And who decides who gets a say?""

""The global community,"" she replied firmly. ""Through open dialogue and cooperation.""

Mercer considered her words. ""Perhaps you're right. This has grown beyond any single entity's jurisdiction.""

Ethan sensed an opportunity. ""We can form a coalition‚Äîscientists, ethicists, leaders from around the world‚Äîto chart a responsible path forward.""

Mercer nodded slowly. ""Very well. I'll support this initiative.""

In the weeks that followed, an international summit was convened. Representatives from every nation gathered to discuss the future of resurrection technology. The debates were intense, but for the first time, humanity faced the ethical quandaries together.

Ethan, Mara, Lucien, and Dr. Kumar played pivotal roles in guiding the discussions. Even Serena contributed, her insights invaluable in understanding the technology's potential and pitfalls.

Public opinion remained divided, but with transparency and education, fear gave way to cautious optimism. Regulations were established, prioritizing ethical considerations and societal impact.

One evening, as the summit drew to a close, Ethan stood on a balcony overlooking the city. Mara joined him, the night breeze tousling her hair.

""We did it,"" she said softly.

He smiled. ""It's a beginning. There's still much work to be done.""

She leaned on the railing. ""Do you ever wonder if we made the right choices?""

""Every day,"" he admitted. ""But I believe involving everyone was the only way to handle something this profound.""

She looked at him thoughtfully. ""You know, asking 'What would an all-knowing entity do?' led us here.""

He chuckled. ""Perhaps. Or maybe we just finally listened to our better angels.""

They stood in comfortable silence, the city's lights shimmering like stars brought to earth.

""Whatever the future holds,"" Mara said, ""I'm glad we're facing it together.""

""Me too,"" Ethan agreed.

Used bottled water.  Wet filter prior to brew.

KM5.  Set grinder to setting 5 per manual.  7 scoops (using Moccamaster included scoop) of Kirkland medium roast.  

Brew #1.  Brew cycle did not brew all water.  Approx. 1.75 cups pf water were left in water holder.  Obviously coffee was too strong.  

At setting #5, could beans have been ground too fine....or can it be something else?

  
Brew #2.  Ground beans using setting #4.  Used 6 scoops of coffee.  Brew cycle brewed all the water this time.  

Coffee was strong, but good.  I've been drinking a combination of various Keurig varieties and restaurant coffee for the past few years so I will have to develop a palate for better tasting coffee!

  
Questions:

KM5:  How to you remove remaining beans from from hopper if not grinding all beans?  Just use enough and grind all beans that are in hopper?

Can ground beans be kept 1-2 days in glass container with rubber storage lid and still retain freshness?

  
How do you store ground beans after package is opened?

  
KBT:  Is water stored inside brewer after brew cycle?  If so, wouldn't water go bad if not used regularly?

My mom kicked me out for a stupid reason. So I left my city and ended up in North Hollywoods streets. Everyday was an adventure. I was having fun staying in the car of a kind young woman who had just met me. She had 6 kids so she let me sleep in her car. We became really close. My mom had reached out about a month or so later, realizing she was wrong and said I could go back. I declined because I was having a good time with my new friends.

Finally, I got sick. High fever & the one person who I thought loved me (not the kind young woman, someone else I had met while on the streets) didn't seem to care that I had a fuckin fever. All they cared about was going to the New Years party we were invited to. They went anyway and left me alone, sick in the car. Their younger brother, 12, saw his sister their without me. He knew I was sick. He walked 4 blocks in the ghetto, in the hood, just to bring me cold water and soup. We played Yu Gi Oh and he told me to just leave her... The moment I felt better I did. I came home.

Now back then, my home life was not the best environment. Mom was an addict in an abusive relationship and would lash out on us if we got involved. So needless to say, I was depressed coming back to this Hell Hole. I slept all day and didn't really do anything for weeks. I was just missing my life and friends back in North Hollywood. And I live 5 hours from NorHo so it's not like I could have just asked them to drive 10 hours just to see me. Plus, I didn't have a phone. Never did the whole time being homeless, just my iPod. I never thought about actually unaliving myself but I did wish I was dead because I just felt dead inside. Nothing was making me happy. Even my weed, I stopped smoking because it just wasnt doing it for me no more.

Finally, my mom wakes me up early to go help her get groceries. I was never up that early. We came home and we always left the TV on. I always put away the groceries. Well, while doing so I heard Wendy Williams on the television. I knew who she was but never cared. But I was so depressed I didn't care to change the channel so I sat down on the couch....& Wendy Williams pulled out a Slim Jim from under her wig and lit it up like a joint. I fucking laughed so hard like my body was just waiting for this moment. That crayC girl!! So now I'm watching and listening to this silly human being because she got my attention with that Slim Jim. And I've always been into celebritys and all that, that she would talk about but it's been a while since I had gave damn. But the way she talked to us, the audience, was like gossiping with my aunts or grandma. She was so unhinged and unapologetic, I loved her. Anyway,the episode ended & I'm like ""aww"". But then I realize, if I can make it another 24 hours, I get to see her again. I get to laugh again if I just hold on to the next day. So everyday after that, I would wake up and make my coffee to gag with her & just laugh. She reminded me of me so much. I always understood why she said what she said. I always agreed with her on almost everything. Even when she would say something about the celebrities that I love, I didn't care. Again, she was like your grandma gossiping and grandmas don't always like your friends, so I never took anything Wendy Williams said about my faves, personally. I still loved her. I still do.

I only wish I could have met her to let her know how much she means to me.

She always said ""This is a silly show. I'm here to entertain you and make you laugh in hopes you can forget about your problems and life, even if just for an hour."" And I swear she was talking to me because she did do that for me. God, Im tearing up right now as I'm typing this. She deserves the world in my eyes. I miss her everyday, so much.

I've had to go back to the beginning, since I'm caught up for the last like 2 years (lol) and I'm watching an oldie about bosses and clap backs, and wanted to share my story!

I worked at a very popular and well-known coffee chain, and my manager was a miserable old cow (don't know why this is an expression, cows are the best!) She was a typical 40 something, still stuck in that high school mentality. Favorites, cliches, talking behind her employees backs, and make it difficult for the non-favesies. 

About a month after being at this location and under this manager, I experienced a miscarriage. I called her the day I went to the hospital and told her I couldn't come in and why, her response? ""I'll help you out this one time, but finding coverage is your responsibility."" Bruh... what? I didn't have anyone's number, hadn't even met everyone in the store, and I'm experiencing a medical emergency!? 

I continued to do me and challenge her bullshit, do what is right, not just what I'm told, or ""how we've always done things"" and after a few more months she wanted to write me up for ""talking back"" to her fave shift lead. The lead wanted me to deep clean, front and back of house, while working register and making drinks.. We were the only 2 in the store, and she wanted me to do everything while she did the food pull... which took every other lead 15 minutes, but it took her 2 hours. So there I was, working everything, being Cinderella and deep cleaning everything. I pulled out one of the fridges under the counter and was cleaning the mass amounts of spoiled milk behind it and a regular walked up and was patiently waiting for me to get done. She pokes her head out front, sees him patiently waiting and asks why I haven't gotten his order yet. I responded with I was deep cleaning, like you asked, and couldn't see him, and that I can't possibly do everything, everywhere, all at once.. 

She wrote me up after I complained about the work load... then sent a text to the DM that said ""(insert my name) cried when she got her write up üòÇüñïüèª"" How do I know this, you might be asking yourself? Because she accidentally sent it to the new girl instead.. I called HR, asked that girl if she was comfortable sharing that message, she was because I trained her and she loved me, and that manager lost her job. I still have not lost sleep over it.

Thanks for everyone who commented on my post last week, you were all a big help!



Now let me tell you all we did during her special day!

First we woke up at 8:30 AM cause we were supposed to get the day started, I say ""supposed to"" because we spent well over an hour just cuddling in bed >w<, after that we went out on a walk for 30 minutes and arrived at a cafe I've always liked. 

[Our breakfast date :P](https://preview.redd.it/hfj5mum4zg4e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0326943bff501dc17c661bfcc6c81ccec0b87466)

In the cafe we ordered a vegetarian sandwich that had avocado, cream cheese. tomato and pesto, it tasted amazing! I always ordered the meat sandwich but I decided to taste this one cause it's the one she likes :>. With that we ordered a fruit tartlet and it was delicious! (And a coffee because I wanted one).  

After that we walked back home and I picked up some flowers in the way for a surprise I had prepared for her.  
I had decided to cook one of her favorite plates! She was so happy and I enjoyed cooking it for her a lot üòä.

[The plate I made, it's name is \\""Prosperous peace\\"" and it's inspired by the chinese plate \\""Eight treasure rice\\"". The design is a \\""Qilin\\"", Ganyu's race.](https://preview.redd.it/7u1leacxzg4e1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=3864d77aed0a232e337f2cd3c3211e7c66d90736)

We ate part of it together and she loved it, I ate a portion too although I don't like the plate very much to begin with, but idk, eating it with her made me forget about the taste.  
  
After that we cleaned up and had to get back to our normal days cause we both had a lot of pending work for this week, but of course I had to leave everything on standby for her <3

And of course, today was her official birthday so I sang her happy birthday, kissed her and spent some time doing things together in her source, my favorite thing of today was the letter she wrote!

[\\""And truly relax amidst nature's embrace\\"" GAAAHHH MY POOR HEART CAN'T BEAR HOW LOVELY SHE IS ü©µü©µü©µü©µü©µ](https://preview.redd.it/mnf6qr8l1h4e1.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6760c92d5d25db9c86108ec442cc682fb390707)

Well that's about it, I still wish we had more time to do everything I planned to do but guess I can't always be that lucky, but spending my day with her was already enough to fill my heart with joy and I hope her's too.

1h50jjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingErgonomic/comments/1h50jjt/ergofriendly_my_journey_with_the_adesso_keyboard/,Ergo-Friendly: My Journey with the Adesso Keyboard,"## Unboxing Comfort, One Keystroke at a Time

Ever felt like your keyboard was a torture device designed by a sadistic genius? Yeah, me too. That's why I decided to swap my ancient, soul-crushing keyboard for the Adesso ergonomic model. Let's dive into my personal experience, explore the science behind ergonomics, and see if this keyboard is worth the hype.
  
  
## The Wake-Up Call: My Back's Story

I never thought a keyboard could be the source of so much discomfort. But there I was, hunched over my desk like a pretzel, battling the relentless ache in my back and wrists. It started innocently enough‚Äîjust a twinge here and there. But over time, it escalated into a full-blown rebellion. I felt like my body was sending me an urgent memo: ‚ÄúHey, buddy! We need to talk about your typing situation!‚Äù

My old keyboard was like an ancient relic from a time when ergonomics was merely a fancy word. The keys were stiff, and my fingers felt like they were doing a workout just to type a simple email. I‚Äôd spend hours typing away, only to end up with a sore back and fingers that felt like they‚Äôd run a marathon. It was ridiculous! I even had to start using a heat pack after long sessions, which, let me tell you, is not the most dignified look when you‚Äôre trying to impress your coworkers.

And then there were the headaches. Oh boy, the headaches! I found myself rubbing my temples more than I was actually typing. I knew I had to make a change. My back was practically waving a white flag, begging for relief. Little did I know, this discomfort was just the wake-up call I needed to explore the world of ergonomic keyboards.

## Unboxing the Adesso: First Impressions

Unboxing the Adesso was like opening a treasure chest filled with potential. As I peeled back the packaging, I was greeted by a sleek design that screamed ‚ÄúI mean business!‚Äù The glossy finish and the subtle curves made it look like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. I mean, if keyboards had personalities, this one would be the cool kid in school. 

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/ergonomic-keyboard-adesso> 

The moment I lifted it out, I was surprised by its weight. Not too heavy, but enough to feel sturdy. You know how some keyboards feel like they might float away? Not this one. It felt grounded, like it was ready to take on whatever I threw at it‚Äîbe it a marathon work session or an intense gaming night. 

Setting it up was a breeze. I plugged it in, and voil√†! It was like magic. No complicated instructions or software downloads. Just pure, unadulterated simplicity. But here‚Äôs where I got a little thrown off: the keys had a soft touch that was almost too quiet. I‚Äôm used to the satisfying click-clack of traditional keyboards, so the silence felt a bit eerie at first. But as I started typing, I realized it was a nice change. My fingers glided over the keys like they were dancing on a cloud. Who knew typing could feel so‚Ä¶ luxurious?

## Mastering the Art of Hand Placement

When I first laid my hands on an ergonomic keyboard, I felt like a toddler trying to ride a bike for the first time‚Äîexcited but totally wobbly. The design was so different from the traditional flat keyboard I was used to. My fingers seemed to have a mind of their own, dancing awkwardly over the keys as I struggled to find the right position. It was a comedy of errors, really. I‚Äôd often hit the wrong keys, and my typing speed plummeted. I could almost hear my inner voice snickering, ‚ÄúWhat happened to the typing whiz you used to be?‚Äù

Proper hand placement is crucial for ergonomics and productivity. I quickly learned that keeping my wrists straight and my fingers slightly curved made a world of difference. At first, it felt unnatural, like trying to eat soup with a fork. But over time, I began to appreciate the comfort it brought. I started to focus on my posture too‚Äîsitting up straight, feet flat on the ground, and the screen at eye level. 

Every time I caught myself slumping or resting my wrists too heavily, I‚Äôd remind myself: it‚Äôs about long-term comfort, not just instant typing gratification. Slowly but surely, I became more adept at this new typing style, and my productivity began to soar. Who knew that a little hand placement could lead to such a big difference?

## The Science Behind Ergonomics

Ergonomics is like the science of comfort, and it‚Äôs all about making our workspaces fit us, not the other way around. Think of it this way: when you sit at your desk, you want everything to feel just right. If you‚Äôve ever tried typing on a keyboard that feels like it was designed for a giant, you know what I mean! The main principles of ergonomics focus on reducing strain and preventing injuries. Studies show that a good ergonomic setup can decrease the risk of repetitive strain injuries, which are as fun as they sound‚Äîspoiler alert: they‚Äôre not.

One study published in the _Journal of Occupational Health_ found that using ergonomic keyboards can significantly reduce discomfort in the hands and wrists. Experts recommend keeping your wrists straight and your hands relaxed while typing. This is where the design of certain keyboards, like the one I‚Äôve been using, comes into play. They often have a split design that allows your hands to rest in a more natural position. 

With features such as a cushioned wrist rest and adjustable angles, these keyboards help maintain proper posture. It‚Äôs like giving your hands a cozy little hug while you type. Who knew typing could feel like a warm embrace? This thoughtful design minimizes the strain on your muscles, making long hours at the keyboard a lot more bearable.

## The Adesso's Hidden Features: More Than Meets the Eye

When I first laid eyes on the Adesso keyboard, I thought it was just a fancy piece of tech designed to make my typing more comfortable. Little did I know, it was hiding some impressive features that would soon become essential to my daily routine. Seriously, this keyboard is like the Swiss Army knife of typing!

One of the standout features is its programmability. Imagine being able to set up shortcuts for all those repetitive tasks that usually make you want to pull your hair out. I mean, who has time to click through endless menus? With a few clicks, I programmed my most-used functions right onto the keyboard. It‚Äôs like having a personal assistant that doesn‚Äôt need coffee breaks!

And let‚Äôs not forget about the macro keys. These little gems are a game changer. I can execute complex commands with just a single press. Need to copy and paste a bunch of stuff? Boom! One key does it all. It‚Äôs like magic, but without the wand. My productivity has soared‚Äîseriously, I feel like I‚Äôm in a typing competition every day.

Oh, and the backlighting? It‚Äôs not just for show. Typing in the dark is no longer a struggle. I can actually see what I‚Äôm doing! Plus, it adds a touch of flair to my workspace. Who knew a keyboard could be this much fun?

## Ergo-Living: Incorporating Ergonomics into Daily Life

Ergonomics isn‚Äôt just about fancy keyboards or chairs; it‚Äôs a way of life, folks! I‚Äôve learned that incorporating ergonomic practices throughout the day can make a world of difference‚Äînot just for my wrists but for my entire body. You see, when I switched to an ergonomic keyboard, it was like a light bulb went off in my head. Suddenly, I was more aware of how I sat, how I moved, and how I interacted with my workspace.

One thing I started doing was setting reminders to stretch. Seriously, I can't tell you how many times I‚Äôd get lost in a rabbit hole of YouTube videos, only to look up and realize I‚Äôd been sitting like a pretzel for hours. Now, I take a quick break every hour. I stretch my arms, twist my torso, and do a little dance‚Äîokay, maybe not a full-on dance, but you get the idea. 

I also adjusted my chair height and desk setup so that everything feels just right. My monitor is now at eye level, which has helped reduce that annoying neck strain. I even found a cozy spot for my feet‚Äîno more dangling like a kid on a swing!

So, if you want to live that ergo-friendly life, remember: it‚Äôs not just about your keyboard. It‚Äôs about creating a space that feels good for your whole body. What little changes can you make today?

## Conclusions
  
  
After months of using the Adesso keyboard, I can confidently say that investing in ergonomics was one of the best decisions I've made for my health and productivity. While there was a learning curve, the comfort and long-term benefits have far outweighed any initial challenges. If you're considering an ergonomic keyboard, give the Adesso a try - your future self will thank you!",1,1733160844.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

We are about to move into a much larger house with more than enough space in the kitchen. I've been shopping around for the last week, online, trying to find the right machine but so far I haven't been able to settle on anything.

For reference, her parents have the Philips 5500 and she loves it. So as far as coffee quality goes, I don't think we need to go beyond that. Neither of us have a palate sophisticated enough to appreciate significantly higher end machines.

The problem is, she only drinks regular coffee and I only drink decaf (otherwise my anxiety skyrockets). I know there are dual hopper machines out there, but I'm really trying to keep the total budget at $1500 max and all of the highly recommended machines with dual hoppers that I've found so far go beyond my budget.

I would like to have the same experience as her - an automatic machine that you dump the beans in and hit a couple of buttons. I know that the Philips machines have a small hopper for preground coffee, but it defeats the purpose of buying the fully automatic machine for me if I have to grind my own beans and/or just dump pre-ground coffee into the machine every time I want a cup.

We have a lot of space and I've considered just buying two Philips 4400 machines if I absolutely have to, but I'd prefer a machine with two bean hoppers.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",1,1733160495.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1

I‚Äôm lost. That is the only explanation why I am in the middle of nowhere. And this job, that seems too good to be true. But I couldn‚Äôt tell Rhonda that. Especially since I have been nagging her relentlessly to find me something to do. A job in our town doesn‚Äôt come by easily. A job like this comes once in a lifetime. Accommodation included. I‚Äôm either the luckiest I have ever been in my life or I am about to get kidnapped and no one would come looking for me. There would be no one to look for me anyway. If payment wasn‚Äôt already enticing, then the two week accommodation for the job really sealed the deal. Especially since I haven‚Äôt taken a shower in the three weeks since my aunt kicked me out. Washing yourself in the gas station sink doesn‚Äôt count. I pull up my phone, the cracked screen is making it harder for me to navigate on it but it does its job. And either way, I have two dollars to my name, so I can‚Äôt afford to replace it. My phone tells me I am in the right place but it can‚Äôt be right. Trees everywhere and a dirt road. Maybe this was just a prank. I rest my forehead on the wheel, its coolness calming me. I perk up at the sound of another car coming this way. In the rearview mirror I see a red Jeep coming this way. There‚Äôs enough room for both of us and I hope I can ask them where I am. I roll my window down. And luckily I don‚Äôt even have to signal to the car because it stops right next to me. The car is so clean that I cringle looking at the dust on mine. As if the dust is the only tell that I am poor as dirt. The window comes down in a smooth motion, unlike mine, which I have to roll down using a lever that cuts into my skin, because the plastic part of it fell off long ago. And the tape I rolled around it is coming apart again too. My life is coming apart. Or it has always been crumbling around me. But until three weeks ago I had a place to stay.  

‚ÄúMorning' young lady‚Äù A man with grey hair and a cowboy hat greets me. He tips his hat and I follow suit by lowering my chin. Politeness is something I am not familiar with. I blush slightly. ‚ÄúAre you the new maid Anthony hired?‚Äù My blush deepens. I guess if I were to see myself from another‚Äôs eyes I would look like a maid too. 

‚ÄúGood morning, I am the new model mister Anthony Bordein hired. But I seem to be lost.‚Äù No surprise in his eyes at my words. He instead nodded approvingly. 

‚ÄúApologies. He‚Äôs been looking for a maid for some time now. I didn‚Äôt mean to imply anything.‚Äù He must have read everything in my eyes. I just waved him off as if it was nothing. He looked forward and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to get lost the first time you come here, but once you get to the house you‚Äôll find your way out easily. I‚Äôll drive ahead and show you. I‚Äôm George.‚Äù I smile politely. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Anna.‚Äù I fidget in my seat. 

‚ÄúNice to meet you Anna.‚Äù He said and took off right away. 

He drives ahead and stops as if knowing it would take my car several tries to start. I swear under my breath as the car finally starts. If he had to tow me I would probably just dig a hole and crawl into it. But meeting him put to rest some of my worries that the man who hired him might be a psychopath who wants to eat me alive. After driving for a few minutes George takes a right turn that I missed the first time. This time I noticed the wooden plank. Number 156 written not on any wooden plank but on one that I could tell was high quality. Some sort of smooth wood. It was easy to miss as it blended in the foliage around it. Soon enough we existed the thick of the forest that revealed a giant driveway that stood in front of what I can only describe as a mansion. A very elegant mansion made out of exposed brick. Surrounded by a beautiful landscape. Flower beds, trees of different colors and shapes, statues and small bird fountains. All blending together creating a beautiful garden tableau. I felt very out of place. I washed myself as best as I could this morning and even wore my cleanest tank top. A white one. My bra did not dry from when I washed it last night. Luckily I had the classic model body that lacked any curves so I didn‚Äôt find it vulgar or too revealing when I wore no bra. My jeans have not been washed in ages but jeans don‚Äôt need to be washed that often. Right? I wore no makeup because I had none either way. I was proud that I washed my hair that has always been my best feature and I didn‚Äôt need to fret about it because it just needed to be washed and my curls set themselves. The job mentioned they will provide outfits and makeup. I just needed to show up. So here I was. Standing in front of this gorgeous mansion. I didn‚Äôt even know a place like this existed in Elkins.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs where I am leaving you.‚Äù George said by way of goodbye. I looked at him wearily ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in charge of transportation. I have to pick up an item and deliver it to Morgantown. Ring the doorbell. Anthony should be home.‚Äù He waved and walked off to the side of the house. I took a deep breath and puffed it out. The house was beckoning, its enticing feel made my feet move finally. Two weeks in this place. I probably have my own room. Hell, even a closet would do as long as I had access to a bathroom. What I wouldn‚Äôt give for a bath. I never had one. My aunt's house had a shower. If you can call a sink with a shower hose tied to it a shower. 

One foot in front of the other I went up the four step stairs that led to the front door. The large mahogany door stood tall in front of me. I ran my hand down the smooth wood. I rang the doorbell. Two weeks here and I would be able to drive North to New York. I would have enough money for gas, food and I could couch surf until I got a serious gig. I waited. The door opened finally. 

‚ÄúCaleb, make sure that order went through. They called again complaining that the website is not letting them order.‚Äù A man in his late 30‚Äôs opened the door, half turned, talking to someone named Caleb. He faced me, his piercing blue eyes full of mischief. A smirk on his face as he took me in. His raven hair was cut short. He was handsome. The kind of rugged handsome that would make any girl's knees weak but not mine. 

‚ÄúHi there, you must be Anna. Come on in.‚Äù He said and turned around, I followed him inside and closed the door behind me. He was walking fast, I barely had time to take in my surroundings. The house was furnished and decorated with taste. White marble floors, wood furniture, minimalist but cozy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Anthony. I‚Äôm the one who talked to Rhonda.‚Äù He said as he entered the kitchen area. Another man. Younger. In his 20‚Äôs sat at a kitchen island. A laptop in front of him. His dark eyes lifted and looked at me, then right back at his laptop. ‚ÄúThis is Caleb. He‚Äôs my business partner slash photographer slash web designer.‚Äù Caleb didn‚Äôt say anything or even acknowledge me. ‚ÄúDo you want something to drink? Coffee, tea?‚Äù He opened the fridge and looked inside. ‚ÄúOrange juice?‚Äù He lifted a bottle of orange juice, his eyebrows lifted? The smirk on his face remained there at all times. 

‚ÄúCoffee please.‚Äù I stood there not knowing what to do with myself. Anthony took the orange juice bottle and headed to the kitchen counter. He opened a cupboard and pulled out a white porcelain cup that had a small plate. ‚ÄúLatte?‚Äù He asked and looked over his shoulder. I nodded. He started work on a coffee machine. One of the big ones that you see in a nice coffee shop. He steamed the milk and even made a small heart in the coffee. He handed me the coffee cup and winked at me. I had to look away. He was extremely charming. I placed my cup on the kitchen island opposite from Caleb. Who was now watching me under his eyebrows. His decadent mouth slightly open. But no expression on his face, no tell in his eyes. He met my eyes, realizing I could see him staring and he looked away. His jaw clenched. I cleared my throat and straightened realizing that I am being assessed. However his granite face doesn‚Äôt indicate if he likes what he sees. Anthony placed two clear glasses of orange juice on the island and then took a seat next to Caleb. 

‚ÄúIs the coffee to your liking?‚Äù He asked as I was taking a sip. I placed the cup down and smiled as I liked my lower lip. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs delicious. Thank you.‚Äù His half smirk extended to his eyes as he looked at my lips for a fraction of a second then looked away towards the coffee machine. 

‚ÄúNew addition. Getting anything delivered out here is a pain. After so many lost deliveries I decided to become a barista myself.‚Äù He grinned widely. I giggled. Giggled. He was devastatingly charming. I took a deep breath well aware of the fact that I was not wearing a bra. But to my surprise he averted looking anywhere else but in my eyes. 

‚ÄúTell me about yourself Anna.‚Äù Anthony asked, sipping his orange juice. Caleb kept typing. There‚Äôs nothing about me that‚Äôs interesting. 

‚ÄúWhat would you like to know?‚Äù I averted his eyes and instead looked around at the kitchen. It was a modern farmhouse design. I knew because I saw it in a magazine in Rhonda‚Äôs office. Not much decorations. As if they just moved here. 

‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù He looked around as well. ‚ÄúWe just moved in a month ago. I didn‚Äôt get around to decorating.‚Äù I nodded. 

‚ÄúI was born here in Elkins. Never left.‚Äù His accent told me he‚Äôs not from here. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Boston and Caleb here is from L.A.‚Äù my eyebrows rose in a silent questioning. ‚ÄúWe moved here because I like the quiet. And with our new business I can work from anywhere.‚Äù I looked toward Caleb who lifted his eyes for a second. 

‚ÄúWhy here?‚Äù In the middle of nowhere. Why move somewhere where I can‚Äôt wait to leave. If I had money and a choice Elkins would be the last place on earth I would move to. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cheesy but I like John Denver. Country roads is my comfort song. I wanted to know what it truly felt like to live in West Virginia.‚Äù I almost snorted. Cheesy indeed. But I gave him a polite smile and an understanding nod. 

‚ÄúDo you do anything else besides modeling?‚Äù I considered it. 

‚ÄúDoes working part time at McDonalds count?‚Äù Caleb snorted. Anthony gave him a sidelong glance. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre funny. I like you.‚Äù He said and got up. I guess my life could be considered funny. If modeling fails I will consider comedy for rich people.

‚ÄúRhonda informed you what we expect of you I hope.‚Äù He stopped at the door. I got up and followed him. He continued down the hallway. Rhonda did tell me but she said I should kiss her feet for this job and if I screw it up she‚Äôll never find me another job again. 

‚ÄúWe need someone to pose with our new models and test them.‚Äù I stopped in my tracks. Anthony turned, his head tilted to the side. 

‚ÄúTest them?‚Äù He must be joking. Rhonda didn‚Äôt mention that. He sighed deeply.

‚ÄúSo I guess she did not tell you everything. Well before you refuse, let me show you what I am talking about.‚Äù I chewed on my cheek nervously. Am I supposed to test them in front of him or them? Am I supposed to test them and answer a questionnaire? I didn‚Äôt know which one was worse. Damn you Rhonda. The dream of going to New York in two weeks evaporated. And I quit my shift at McDonalds too. It would have been fine if I didn‚Äôt throw my apron in my manager's face and told him: aux revoir. So I sighed deeply and followed Anthony without a word. Until we reached a door that he opened leading downward to what I could only assume was a basement. This is either a joke or I am still dreaming in my car. He turns on the stairlight. And steps down. I freeze and look as he goes downstairs. I should run. I should turn around, jump in my car and drive as far as I can and never look back. Except I‚Äôm almost out of gas. Getting lost here wasted my chance to even make it back to town. I swallow once, twice and I step down, down into a basement. Rhonda knows where I am, but will she even care to look for me if I go missing? I doubt it. I keep a healthy distance from him. Maybe I can sense if there‚Äôs danger and make it up the stairs in time. The basement opens into a wide space. The reddish dim lighting inside makes my heart pump inside my head. I should have ran, I have no sense of danger. I just follow anyone who gives me a kind smile and a cup of coffee. I‚Äôm pathetic. I deserve to die if that‚Äôs what this day has in store for me. 

I stop in my stacks three stairs up from the bottom. Anthony opens the light. The room looks normal in this lighting. Normal except the strange swings and tables laying around. 

‚ÄúRhonda said you sell sex toys.‚Äù I say with confusion. Anthony took a seat on the edge of a table cushioned with fine white leather. He crossed his muscled arms. I looked around the room instead of at him. 

‚ÄúSex toys?‚Äù He huffed a laugh. ‚ÄúI guess you could call them toys. These are high end sex furniture.‚Äù My eyes widened. ‚ÄúFor light bondage and increasing comfort and depth.‚Äù He winked and smiled, biting his tongue. My blush deepened. 

‚ÄúAnd how exactly am I supposed to test this‚Ä¶ furniture?‚Äù I swallowed the lump in my throat. My heart was pounding hard but not from nerves. 

‚ÄúI guess Rhonda didn‚Äôt tell you anything of use.‚Äù I shook my head. He sighed as he stood and headed to the side of the room towards an intricate swing. ‚ÄúThis is a sex swing. It helps with deeper penetration and makes bouncing easier. The upside of this is that it is very comfortable because of the quality cushioning. And it looks great in your bedroom.‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt wrong, the hanging part was made out of braided rope and white leather. ‚ÄúAnd it can be used for bondage as well.‚Äù He stuck his finger on the side of the rope and it unraveled in a very satisfying way. I was actually impressed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll sit in it. Caleb will take a few photos and videos of you swinging. And as for testing you‚Äôll need to talk about how comfortable you are in it and maybe I'll ask you some other questions that come to my mind. Is that something you‚Äôre comfortable with?‚Äù I stared at him gaping. He waited. The things that went through my mind as I walked down here were‚Ä¶ Well, let‚Äôs say that I feel embarrassed for actually considering them. But this. 

‚ÄúAm I going to be wearing anything?‚Äù His eyebrows perked. 

‚ÄúYes, of course. The pictures will be tasteful. And the videos will be sent only to clients who request them. Usually we don‚Äôt need them.‚Äù A sigh of relief left my body. 

‚ÄúThen yes, I am comfortable with the pictures and videos.‚Äù He grinned wide and he clapped his hands once as he stepped close to me and clasped my shoulders. I looked up at him, my heart was pounding again. 

‚ÄúPerfect. I was worried for a moment. And I did not want to have to deal with Rhonda again. No offense.‚Äù He grimaced. I smiled.

‚ÄúNone taken. I hope I won‚Äôt have to deal with her after this either.‚Äù He looked at me with consideration and nodded. 

‚ÄúCome. I‚Äôll show you to your room.‚Äù I followed him up the stairs. 

‚ÄúWhy two weeks with accommodation? Not that I‚Äôm complaining. I could use the money.‚Äù And accomodation. But I didn‚Äôt say that. He turned off the light to the stairwell and closed the door. 

‚ÄúI have five different swings to test and I didn‚Äôt think about installing them all and there‚Äôs no room for more than one. So I need to wait for the handyman to come by and change them every two, three days. And we have the massage tables and other pieces I want to photograph. And Rhonda mentioned if I can offer you accommodation because it takes an hour to get here.‚Äù That was something I didn‚Äôt expect from Rhonda. Especially since I begged her to let me sleep on her office couch and she kicked me out. I should send her a thank you note when I leave Elkins.

Anthony led me up a staircase to the second floor. There were so many doors that I wondered why he even bought a house this big. Maybe he has a family. He stops in front of a door and opens it. He gestures for me to go inside. I swallow a whimper. The room is‚Ä¶I tried my best not to tear up in front of Anthony. The room was decorated in soft beige and burgundy with golden accents. The bed was a dream - a four poster bed full of ornate pillows and a beautiful throw in burgundy, bleu, cream and toffee, that I imagined I would wrap myself in as I sipped my tea by the cozy window seat that I spotted. 

‚ÄúThis is where I leave you. I hope the room is to your liking. This one is the most colorful out of all the bedrooms in the house.‚Äù I turned to face him, my smile was genuine, although I tried not to look too grateful. I didn‚Äôt want him to know I have been sleeping in my car for close to three weeks. 

‚ÄúThank you. It‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù He nodded absentmindedly, as if something important was tugging at him. 

‚ÄúThe bathroom is through that door.‚Äù He pointed and then he was out of my room before I could blink. I opened my mouth to ask him when we‚Äôre going to start but it was too late. So instead I decided to explore the bathroom. I screamed excitedly as a bathtub stood mightily in the middle of the room. I turned on the faucet and ran my hands under it. The pressure of the water alone made me sigh loudly. I spent what could have been all afternoon in the bathtub, until my skin was so crinkly that I thought a moment longer in water and it would fall. I realized I left my bag in the car, but I had no change except for a pair of leggings and a t-shirt. I Iaid in the middle of the bed in my towel, considering if I should just wear the jeans and shirt I came in and run to my car to get my bag. But the thought of putting my old clothes back on after I scrubbed every inch of my body made me feel disgusted. 

Suddenly a knock on the door awoke me from my thoughts. I jumped off the bed and opened the door wide. In my towel with no regards about it or where I was. Caleb sat there, with a bored look on his face. I closed the door leaving it open just a sliver and hid behind it.

‚ÄúThere are fresh clothes in the closet. Wear the purple outfit and leave your hair like this.‚Äù I touched my hair, it was wet and ruffled. ‚ÄúNo makeup needed. I‚Äôll see you downstairs in 10 minutes.‚Äù And left.

I started semaglutide through Amble on Friday and had to go to the ER last night. 

I was dizzy, disoriented, shaking and vomiting. No stomach ache or pains, but then I started getting chest pains because I was having a panic attack thinking something really serious was happening. It‚Äôs a feeling I have never felt and I still don‚Äôt feel very good. 

I barely drank water yesterday (maybe 40 oz) 
I had half of a seven brew coffee and went to lunch with my fianc√©. 

I got a chimichanga, rice and beans. Took about a bite of each side and ate 1/4 of the chimichanga. I had barely eaten the day before (700 calories) because I was just DONE. 

I went to my dad‚Äôs and over some hours was able to finish my food. 
He gave me a can of soda. 
I need to stress that I NEVER drink sugary soda, only zero sugar. 
This was a fruit punch flavored soda. 

I swear it was about 20 minutes after drinking this that everything hit the fan. I was gagging profusely in the car driving home (it‚Äôs a 20 minute drive) 

Again, NOT nauseous, no gastrointestinal distress. Just vomiting, severely shaky (like entire body trembling uncontrollably) Freezing cold, but felt like my skin was on fire. Super light headed and riddled with vertigo. The room was spinning, I felt like I was underwater.


At the ER, they ran tests and when I got in (shaking uncontrollably still) my blood pressure was HIGH. It has never been this high before. 148/108

They didn‚Äôt do an ekg, they didn‚Äôt check my breath sounds, look in my ears, eyes, or anything else that is standard. 

Blood glucose was 98 

Creatinine and chloride were at the highest end in the ‚Äúnormal range‚Äù 
 
eGFR by CKD-EPI was low. 70.

I am unsure if those things can be due to dehydration but they didn‚Äôt even give me fluids or electrolytes.

It was a quick trip, in and out in two ours but I am worried that they missed something.

No urinalysis either. 

They sent me home with a prescription for an acid reducer and anti-nausea med and completely attributed it to starting semaglutide. 

could this have been a blood sugar issue from having a carb heavy meal (that took over 5 hours to eat) and a sugary soda? 

My question for anyone is have you experienced something like this? Was there an alternative diagnosis if you got treatment?

Following up with my physician asap.

In the listing the host says the key pickup location will be disclosed after booking and 3 days before arrival. It turns out it‚Äôs a 15minuet walk from the flat, annoying considering we‚Äôre traveling with baggage. They also expect you to walk back to drop the key off.

They also said coffee would be available, which it wasn‚Äôt, unless you consider a few grains of instant coffee to be coffee for your guest.

The pillows that were given are thin and compress down to nothing, we also got a ripped up comforter.

There‚Äôs also some 6 co hosts all on the same chat with me, I don‚Äôt need THAT many people knowing where I am or having access to a place my passport is in.

All that is annoying but I can deal with it, but then‚Ä¶.

We‚Äôre waking up congested everyday, I look up in the bathroom and I see mold, the place also stays as humid as a tropical jungle even after opening our singular window for hours and hours. The host tells me it‚Äôs 100% not mold, and the other co-hosts jump in on the conversation. 

I‚Äôm told and I‚Äôm quoting here:

‚ÄúWhat you see on the bathroom ceiling is actually due to a condensation problem caused by a lack of ventilation, often related to the previous use of the room, by past guests. 
Our teams clean it regularly. 

We want to reassure you: it's not black inlaid mold, but just superficial stains that appear in wet areas like bathrooms.

If that bothers you, we'll be happy to send a team to quickly clean these marks.‚Äù

I call airBNB, they see the conversation and sent photos, and agree that is indeed mold.

I told them to send a cleaning team over then as per the co-hosts offer, then the host chimes in and says ‚Äúactually since you‚Äôre leaving tomorrow it‚Äôs too late‚Äù

I‚Äôve been having really violent panic attacks - even at home whilst working - my job isn‚Äôt super stressful but does deal with customer service and can have rude people on the line. My attacks always start with me feeling like I‚Äôm detached from my body, I feel like I‚Äôm dropping. 
Today I‚Äôm off and my partner and I decided to go and buy some Xmas decorations. We went for breakfast, I was feeling super dissociative and strange, everything looked weird and bright.

Eventually it got even worse, and my partner went to the shops alone and I was going to go home (it‚Äôs about 5 min walk from shops) 
I fell to the ground, I was crying and screaming for people to help me, to call an ambulance, I looked insane. Thrashing on the floor not being able to feel my legs or arms, I felt like I was going to die. I thought I was having a stroke. My partner came back and we had to get a taxi to the flat, which was a 5 min walk but I couldn‚Äôt do it. My legs didn‚Äôt work, I couldn‚Äôt breathe. It was horrifically violent.

His eyes slowly opened to a dark room, with the ceiling giving off the occasional sheen from the tiny light sources illuminating the floor around his bed. He lifted his hands up to wipe down against hits face, which oddly gave him a soothing feeling. The moment he stood up from his bed, the lights of his large quarters activated, and a voice welcomed him from above.¬†

‚ÄúGood Morning Admiral. Tour 3 has zero reports at this time. Shift change is imminent with Tour 1. Would you like for me to request coffee at your post? ‚Äú The Female voice requested.¬†

The older Admiral slid off his bed and approach his awaiting uniform in the closet. ‚ÄúYes, Also I‚Äì‚Äù¬†

A Chirp interrupted him and a much more human male voice came over the same speakers. ‚ÄúSir, this is Lt. Clark. We have a situation developing here at the bridge. Its Urgent.‚Äù¬†

The Admiral sighed and respond, ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôm coming. Dismiss all non-essential staff of Tour 3. Have the others stay for a moment.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe are here sir. Clark Out.‚Äù The Speaker fizzed a bit.¬†

The admiral decided to pass up on his shower and immediately put on his uniform. From a distance, his uniform  appeared immaculate. Every Crease tightened and straightened as if on a blade's edge. The few medals he left on his uniform were as polished as his shoes, which went vibrantly well with the white cloth underneath.

His quarters door slid open as he approached it. The bright lights stinging his newly awakened eyes causing him to lift a hand up to rub them once again. The moment he took a step out towards the bridge he noticed the distressed faces of officers around him. They had a quickened step while they made their way down the halls.

‚ÄúHmm..‚Äù He thought to himself before being met with a familiar face waiting on the side of the hall. It was Lt. Blake.

‚ÄúHello Sir, Good Morning. I was sent here to walk with you and give you a preliminary brief. ‚Äú

‚ÄúGo ahead, Katherine.‚Äù The Admiral said, pausing only a moment beside the Lt. before continuing his walk.¬†

The lieutenant's lips smacked a small smile before dropping back to a professional demeanor. ‚Äú We received a distress signal from the Klandine Ascendency. It's on Planet Forvor.‚Äù The lieutenant matched his speed while they walked.¬†

‚ÄúThats a quick jump from here.. Whats it for? Does Terra know?‚Äù The Admiral inquired.

‚Äú They are reporting a large Grovak fleet amassing at their borders. The station that was positioned there has gone dark and assumed destroyed or captured. Terra would like for us to investigate the signal‚Äù

The Admiral looked at the lieutenant puzzled. The large Blast doors of his bridge flashed green and opened.¬†

‚ÄúWho would attack the Klandine? They are nothing more than pacifist monks.‚Äù The Admiral said in a surprised tone.¬†

Another voice perked up as they approached the center of the bridge. ‚Äú We don‚Äôt understand it either. But, Terran Probes did confirm the destruction of Station Shanti. We have not communicated this with the Ascendency yet.‚Äù

The Admiral reached his chair and placed his hands onto the back of it. ‚ÄúAlright.. Well lets let them know. Ready the fleet for a synchronized jump to Planet Frovor.‚Äù

The Admiral turned towards the communication officer. ‚Äú Let the High Eldar‚Äôs of Frover know of our arrival. We are just here to keep an eye on things. Understood?‚Äù

The Comms officer nodded and got to work on his console.

‚ÄúFirst Officer, Dismiss Tour 3. Awaken Tour 2 and have them at the ready. And Tour 3, Keep this to ourselves and try to get some sleep. We should arrive in about three hours. Before the Grovaks.‚Äù The group of officers wearing separate insignias then others in the bridge would nod and leave.

‚ÄúJump when ready, Navigator.‚Äù The admiral took a seat. A light blue light illuminated the ship's ceiling, signaling a jump.

In 3 hours, The large Flagship Designated Arizona or BB-39 of the Terran Navy exited slip space above Forvor along with its fleet of 1 Carrier, 1 Sister battleship, 10 Cruisers, 20 Destroyers, and 50 Frigates.

‚ÄúAlright, Set fighters on a Patrol pattern around the fleet. Everybody on Yellow Alert. Two Tours active at this time. ‚Äú The Bridge responded with a ‚ÄúYes Admiral!‚Äù before typing away at their terminals.¬†

The radar officer quickly spoke out. ‚Äú Sir, We have just connected with the probes near Station Shanti. The Grovak fleet had already jumped 2 hours ago. The estimated time of arrival is one hour from now. ‚Äú

‚ÄúDamn, that was quicker then I thought. First Officer, I am taking over Diplomatic Decision-making on Behalf of the Terran Federation as is my right as Admiral of the Second Fleet.‚Äù

The First Officer nodded and respond. ‚Äú I Commander Richard Flux Concur. What is Second fleets Course of action?‚Äù

The admiral will stand up and signal the comms Officer to open a channel with all bridges of his fleet.¬†

‚ÄúThis is Admiral Armstrong, As you all should know by now. The Grovak Empire has dispatched an imperial fleet towards our location. They have violated Intergalactic law by attacking the Klandine Ascendency. And Are further Violating Intergalactic Law by entering Klandine Space without proper authorization.

You are cleared to engage out of self-defense granted by the Galactic War accords. If you find this ROE change unlawful Signal now..‚Äù

The Admiral stared at a holographic that showed all the ships within his fleet in formation. They all started out grey, but one by one, he saw each go green, signifying compliance with his orders.Once they all went green, he spoke again.¬†

‚ÄúUnderstood. Second Fleet of the Terran Federation. We are at Red Alert‚Äù the moment he uttered red, the ship‚Äôs light  flashed to red with a long audible beep to alert the ship‚Äôs crew.¬†

He‚Äôd take a seat back into its bridge chair and place his hands together to quell the shaking.

‚Äú Alright, Shields up. Weapons active. Standby.‚Äù The Admiral said in a confident tone.¬†

The First Officer nodded and repeated the Admiral. After a few moments, a mass of signatures were detected about 0.000100 AU from the fleet. Soon after the readings, The Third Imperial Conquest fleet of the Grovak Empire exited slip space and hovered beside Frover.¬†

‚Äú Sir, The Grovak fleet arrived with shields active. They must be at Readiness 2 or more.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAlright, le‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúSIR, WEAPONS LOCK DETECTED ON THE OLYMPUS. THE MUNICH. THE HAMB‚Äì‚Äù The Radar officer yelled out but was cut off from another officer.¬†

‚ÄúGROVAKS ENGAGING!‚Äù A Second Radar officer spoke.¬†

Puffs of bright light illuminated the Grovak fleet, which could only mean weapons fire. But before the Admiral gave the order, half of his fleet fired its own salvo of Ballistic weaponry as well.

‚Äú Tell the Carrier Hawaii to send its fighter craft now! ‚Äú The admiral yelled out.¬†

‚ÄúGuns one through three firing! ‚Äú The Weapons Officer said. The battleship shook and rattled as its massive 200mm Railcannons fired its payload toward the attacking fleet.¬†

‚ÄúBRACE BRACE BRACE!‚Äù thousands of beams impacted the shielding of the the fleet. The Blue aura of each ships shields glowing from the intense heat and power of the Grovak beam cannons. A couple frigates shielding not strong enough to handle multiple impacts and being cut cleanly through from differing points.

As Humanities' weapons of war traded munitions with the Grovak Fleets, there were shared explosions on both sides.¬†

Hundreds of explosions litered the once peaceful space above Forver. With Thousands of smaller fighter‚Äôs interlaced in an intense head to head battle near the center of it all.¬†

‚Äú Radar! Find that Flagship! Weapons, Ready Gun two and three for when Radar finds the Grovak ship! Have Gun one fire at will!‚Äù The admiral yelled out, Sweat collecting on his forehead as alarms blare from the multiple impacts on the ships shieldings.¬†

‚ÄúIncoming Torpedoes!‚Äù The Radar Officer warned.¬†

‚ÄúPDC‚Äôs up and engaging. Brace!‚Äù The Weapons Officer responded to the Radar Officer.‚Äù 20-30 Smaller 30 mm Gatling guns would twist and turn towards the direction of the many streaming torpedoes. They all unleashed a hailstorm of lead and ballistics towards the Torpedoes once they passed through the missiles fired to intercept them.

‚Äú Sir! The Olympus is abandoning ship! We lost 15 frigates. The porto and prague are showing extreme damage. ‚Äú The Communication officer updated.

‚ÄúSend The Moscow on search and rescue. Give the order of Dismissal to all ships deemed combat ineffective!‚Äù The Admiral responded.¬†

An explosion rocked the bridge as the shielding receives an impact from an uninterrupted torpedo.

‚Äú Shields at 70%!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSend all Reserve Fighter craft on Torp Intercepter duty!‚Äù The Admiral stood up from his chair. His heart pumping and nerves flaring as he watched the battle unfold between the two large fleets.¬†

‚ÄúFlagship targeted sir!‚Äù The Radar officer chirped.

‚ÄúWeapons! FIRE!‚Äù The Admiral yelled out. Another explosion rocking him almost causing him to fall over.¬†

One shudder was felt but not a second. The Two projectiles from the double-barreled railgun penetrated into a larger sleek craft at the center of the Grovak fleet.¬†

‚ÄúGun three is down sir! Engineering is on it!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDammit. Where is the Bismark?!‚Äù The admiral inquired towards the comms officer.¬†

‚ÄúBismark is heavily damaged sir. Reporting one gun still operational!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúTell it to lock onto our targeting data and to fire at will!‚Äù The admiral responded then turned to the weapons officer. ‚ÄúKeep hitting it!‚Äù.

The BB-39‚Äôs sister ship slowly pull up to the side of the Admiral‚Äôs ship. Its exterior is bludgeoned and battered from the multiple targeted impacts. As ordered, it began firing on the same center ship of the Grovak Flagship along with his own.¬†

After several more impacts, a large blue explosion erupted in the center of the Grovak formation, quickly engulfing a few smaller ships in its cloud of destruction.¬†

Cheers echoed within the bridge from the sight as staff members roared to support the Grovak Flagships destruction. The Admiral sat back into his chair feeling his body relax just a bit before refocusing at the task at hand.

‚ÄúIts not over yet! Have the Bismark fall back. Bring Athens and Napels up to the front. Ready the boarding teams.‚Äù His voice sounded a bit tired but still stern.

‚ÄúSir, Probes detecting another fleet at Station Shanti‚Äôs jump point! They are spinning up their drives! Expected time of arrival‚Ä¶4 hours!‚Äù The Comms officer alerted. The entire bridge went quiet for a moment.

‚ÄúLets not worry about that now! Lets finish this up.‚Äù The admiral straightened himself in his chair. ‚ÄúComms, Request additional reinforcements from Terra. We need the nearest available fleet to jump on our mark.‚Äù

‚ÄúSir, the nearest fleet is 6 Hours from Jump. They will be late.‚Äù The Comms officer responded in a melancholy tone.

The fleet around the flagship began to push forward as the Grovak Imperial fleet slowly broke apart. Bomber Craft escorted by fighter‚Äôs weave through the larger ships and the center large scale dogfight. After some time, they release their payloads on the remaining Grovak Fleet ships, causing most of the Imperial fleet to erupt in a beautiful blue and purple cascade of explosions. A hour after the bomber strike, most of the fighting slowed to a crawl as Terran Boarding parties were sent in to either provide aid to Grovak POW‚Äôs or eliminate further resistance. Once all combat-ineffective ships were evacuated, the admiral decided to address his fleet.¬†

A small projector onboard all ships deployed a Hologram of the admiral's upper body. Sweat drenched his forehead, and his once pristine uniform looked a lot more shaggy due to the stress of the multi-hour-long conflict.

‚Äú My Brothers and Sisters, I speak to all of you. To the ones standing in the bridge, the Men and women crawling through the engineering ducts. And the people currently fighting for their lives. What I will tell you and then ask of you will be heavy. ‚Äú The Admiral straightened himself a bit more and with a deep breath he continued.¬†

‚ÄúA Second Grovak Imperial Fleet will arrive above Frovor in two hours. Much more significant than the last one we fought. Our fleet is at 65% Combat effectiveness. Reinforcements will arrive in 4 Hours, with more to come.‚Äù A distinct silence is enveloped every ship in the damaged terran fleet.

‚Äú I want to remind you. Frover cannot defend itself. They have no weapons nor combat ships. The Grovak Empire is assumed to be going for territorial conquest. We have seen what they do to seized land. They will wipe out everyone down there.‚Äù

The Planet of Forver and the Klandine Ascendency symbol appear beside him. ‚Äú You all know the Ascendency's importance to us as a species. Long ago, they were our first contact. They taught humanity to look past our differences, to Unify, and to look out into the stars. They stopped generational bloodshed and the cycle of violence we always fell within. They taught us internal peace, and with that, we became their shield and sword.‚Äù

‚Äú If we leave, Forver will burn. If we stay, We are projected to be destroyed before Reinforcements arrive but we may be able to stave off the invasion long enough for the Reinforcements to intervene. The Ascendency has asked us to leave.‚Äù The admiral sighed. ‚Äú I will leave it up to a vote. You all have one hour to decide. Use the Compliance system to confirm once your ship has decided. If you decide to leave, you will not be court-martialed. I will order your ships dismissal from combat.‚Äù The Planet of Forver and the Acendency symbol fizzed out leaving only him.

‚Äú That will be all. **Semper Fidelis In Terra.**‚Äù The admiral's Hologram cut off.",4,1733159806.0,HFY,5,0.83,False

A new little coffee shop/used bookstore in the fan. It was so lovely, and had me lamenting that there is not more small community based businesses like this lining the streets.

But I just don't understand how a place like this can be sustainable in this economy. The coffee was great and inexpensive, and there was not too much in and out traffic, but people would buy a small drink and stay for a while.

Assuming everyone who went there paid $5 and there were 100 people that came in a day (just guessing), that's $500. There were 2 baristas and assuming $15/hr for the 14 hours they're open that's $420. Leaving just $80. 

I bet rent there is expensive, plus all the other operating costs I dont think about. Do places like this just run on uber thin margins or are they only possible if you're someone who is financially stable and can afford to run a business at a loss. 

I don't come from a business background so just curious how these things work. Regardless I would highly recommend checking them out :)

üá≥üá± Misschien heb je pas net ontdekt dat het bestaat, of wist je al wat het is en was je er al naar op zoek: Adult Nursing Relationships (ANR) of Adult Breastfeeding (ABF), dus respectivelijk relaties of intieme ontmoetingen waarbij je borstvoeding geeft aan je partner.

Misschien klinkt het raar ‚Äî aan een volwassen partner, echt?! ‚Äî maar dat hoeft niet, vooral als jouw borsten belangrijk zijn voor jouw beleving van fysieke en emotionele intimiteit. Overigens is het niet strikt noodzakelijk dat je lacteert; het kan ook 'droog', de handeling is voor de rest hetzelfde.

Ik weet al lang dat ANR/ABF iets is wat ik ik heel graag wil, ik wist al zelfs nog voordat ik wist dat het een ding was. Alhoewel het voor mij natuurlijk een ware eer en voorrecht zou zijn om jouw moedermelk rechtstreeks van de bron te mogen proeven als je het voor me hebt ‚Äî en ik ook wel bereid ben te helpen om het op te wekken als we daarvoor willen gaan ‚Äî gaat het mij uiteindelijk niet per se om de melk zelf. Het gaat om de reis met jou; de intimiteit, binding, sensualiteit, rust en zaligheid die het geeft om op die manier met jou samen te zijn! 

Dus, als jij een vrouw bent die ervan geniet als haar dames onverdeelde aandacht, liefde en verwennerij ontvangen, dan is dit misschien iets voor jou en wil ik het graag met je verkennen!üôÇ Ik zelf voel me al vanaf vrijwel begin puberteit extreem aangetrokken tot borsten. Voor mij is weinig moment zo zalig als het moment dat ik de volheid en zachtheid van jouw borsten mag voelen in mijn handen, tegen mijn lijf, of in mijn mond ... masseren, kneden, zuigen, ik kan er letterlijk urenlang zonder onderbreking van genieten - jij hopelijk ook! 

Voor de duidelijkheid, ik ben specifiek niet op zoek naar seks, en dus zie ik dit zeker ook zeker niet slechts als een soort achterdeur naar seks. Ik wil de fysieke intimiteit met jou √©cht verkennen via je borsten en ANR/ABFü§ó 

**Hoe ik het voor me zie:** eerst chatten we gewoon online ‚Äî eerst natuurlijk hier op reddit, daarna telefoonnummers uitwisselen en via WhatsApp / Signal / Telegram etc. ‚Äî en wisselen we foto's uit. Daarna lijkt het me fijn om een keer een koffiedate te prikken of als je het leuk lijkt daarna een langere date. Als we een match zijn dan, dan kunnen we overgaan tot een reeks ontmoetingen, en als we echt een goede match zijn en er is een goede klik tussen ons, dan sta ik er zeker voor open om het verdere avontuur van dit leven met jou aan te gaan in een vaste relatie üôÇ

**Over mij:**

-	Leeftijd 33 jaar

-	Lengte ong. 185 cm;

-	Kort donkerblond haar;

-   Rook niet;

-   Geen vaste medicatie of medische aandoeningen;

-   Mooie mannelijke, rustgevende, lage stem, hebben vrouwen mij wel eens verteld;

-   MSc, fulltime baan als ingenieur in de elektrotechniek.

-	Hobbies / interesses: wetenschap, (elektro)techniek, wiskunde, klussen, Inkscape, muziek (bespeel een aantal instrumenten), old school video spellen, fietsenmaken, hardlopen. Waarschijnlijk nog wel meer üòõ

-	Karakter: relaxed, nachtvlinder (van nature; voor mijn werk ben ik een vroege vogel geworden), droge humor, stabiel, introvert, nerderige type met een vleugje romantiek; wees niet verbaasd als ik de eerste keer bloemen voor je meeneem üíêüôÇ

-	Ik woon zelfstandig. Mijn appartement is nog steeds vrij spartaans ingericht en niet alle kamers zijn gestoffeerd - er moet nog wel geklust worden - maar ik ben in staat jou hier te ontvangen!

-	**Wat je van mij kunt verwachten:** ik communiceer pro-actief en neem initiatief. Ik reageer snel op berichten. Ik houd me aan afspraken en kom opdagen als we ergens afgesproken hebben. Ik respecteer alle grenzen die jij aangeeft; jouw 'nee' is voor mij ook NEE.

**Over jou:**

-	Je geniet echt van fysieke intimiteit via je borsten;

-	Waarover gesproken: het gaat mij niet om je cupmaat of welke vorm ze hebben. Het gaat er vooral om dat ze zin hebben om verwend te worden üòâ

-	Single of scheidende. Geen (stiekeme) affaires, geen drama, geen 'poly' constructies.

-	Leeftijd: aller- alleruiterst 18-55 jaar. Kans op iets langdurigs is natuurlijk wel groter als je dichter in de buurt zijn van mijn leeftijd, zegge 26-35;

-	Je bent een biologische vrouw, niet trans;

-	Idealiter woon je in een plaats die in of vanuit de Randstad goed bereikbaar is met het OV (helaas geen auto). Antwerpen kan ook.


-	**Wat ik van jou verwacht:** je reageert omdat je dit ook oprecht wilt proberen; je speelt geen spelletjes maar bent transparant over je intenties, je hebt geen andere agenda. Je ghost niet maar communiceert eerlijk als je twijfels hebt of het niet langer ziet zitten. Je komt met enige regelmaat online, of bent bereikbaar, en je reageert actief.

Als ik onaangekondigd 24 uur achter elkaar niets van jou verneem, of jij vertoont passief en onge√Ønteresseerd gedrag, d.w.z. onredelijk trage of minimale reacties, dan be√´indig ik omwille van van bescherming van mijn eigen tijd ons contact.

üá¨üáß Perhaps you only just discovered that this is even a thing, or you already knew about it and have been seeking it for a while: Adult Nursing Relationships (ANR) or  Adult Breastfeeding (ABF), i.e. respectively relationships or intimate encounters centered around breastfeeding your partner.

That might sound weird ‚Äî breastfeeding an adult partner, really?! ‚Äî but it really isn't, especially if your breasts are a powerful way for you to experience intimacy, emotional or physical. Also required for you to lactate, 'dry nursing' is also a perfectly valid way to go about ANR/ABF.

I have known for a very long time that ANR/ABF is something that I truly desire, even before I knew it was actually a 'thing'. Even though it would be an absolute pleasure and privilege to try your milk straight from the source if you are producing ‚Äî and I would also absolutely be willing to help induce if that's where we take things ‚Äî for me it is not about the milk. Rather, it's about our time and journey together; the intimacy, bonding, sensulaity, peace and bliss that being in the moment with a fine lady like yourself brings üòä

So, if you are a woman who enjoys her girls getting worshipped, spoiled and receiving my undivided attention, then this is something that I would love to explore with you!üôÇ Ik have always felt a strong thing for women's breasts, ever since early puberty. For moe there are few comparable moments that fill me with bliss and happiness as the moment I get to feel the fulness and softness of your bosoms in my hands, up against my body, or in my mouth ... massaging, kneading, suckling, ik can enjoy this for hours without break - and hopefully the same is true for you!

Just to be clear, **I am not looking for sex** and I am also definitely not one of those guys who sees this as a backdoor route to it. I want to explore the bliss and intimacy of ANR/ABF with you, focusing on your breasts, for its own sake ü§ó 


**The way I see this work:** first we chat online ‚Äî obviously we start out here on reddit, then we exchange numbers and take this off-platform to WhatsApp / Signal etc. ‚Äî and we exchange photos. Then I would like to take you out on a coffee date or if you like a longer more elaborate date. If we are a match, then we can take this further into a more intimate setting, and if we are a really good match and there is good chemistry between thus, then I am definitely willing to embark on a long term relationship with you and perhaps one day even tie the knot for good üôÇ

**About me:**

- 33 years old

-	Height: approximately 185 cm (approx. 6'1"" )

- Short, dark blond hair

-   I do not smoke;

-   Do medical issues and take no regular drugs (DDF)

-   Women have told me in the past I have a nice, soothing masculine voice;

-   MSc degree, I work fulltime as an electrical engineer.

-	Hobbies / interests: science, (electrical) engineering, maths, DIY'ing stuff, Inkscape, music (I play a few instruments), old school video games, fixing bikes, running/jogging. There's probably a few more I frogot to think of üòõ

-	Personality: laid back, night owl (by nature; for work I have had to become an early bird), dry humor, stable, introverted, loveable nerd with a romantic streak; do not be surprised if I bring you flowers the first time I see you üíêüôÇ

-	I have my own place. My apartment is still fairly spartan as not all the rooms have gotten a floor yet - there is still some DIY'ing that needs to be done - but I am definitely able to host you here!

-	**What you can expect from me:** I am a pro-active communicatie and I take and show initiative. I respond to messages timely. I show up and I keep promises. Ik respect any boundary you communicate to me; your 'No' really does mean NO to me.

**About you:**

-	You experience and enjoy physical and emotional intimacy through your breasts;

-	Speaking of which: it is not important for me what size or shape they are, I do not obsess about your cup size. I care about them enjoying being worshipped and spoiled üòâ

-	You are actually single, or have already initiated divorce. No sneaky affairs, no drama, no 'poly' constructs. I am not out here looking to wreck homes or existing relationships.

-	Age range: absolute limits are 18-55. Of course for something genuinely long term it would be better if you are close to me in age, say 26-35.

-	You are a biological woman. You are not trans;

-	Preferably you are located in place that is easily reachable from the Randstad by public transport, or perhaps Antwerpen. Unfortunately I do not own a car;

-	**What I expect from you:** be for real. If you reach out it's because you are actually interested in trying or doing this, you are not about playing games and having some hidden agenda, you are forthcoming about your intentions. You do not ghost but are honest about it if you are having second thoughts or have changed your mind. You are online and available to chat regularly, and you respond timely and consistently.

If you up and disappear unannounced in the middle of a back-and-forth conversation and you do not respond within 24 hours, then for the sake of protecting my own time I will assume you have ghosted me and I will move on. Likewise, if I start detecting low effort or a low interest attitude from you - minimal replies, passive reciprocation, unreasonably long response times - then I will also not hesitate to move on.",1,1733159649.0,ANRelationship,0,1.0,False

Hoping yall can help me out. I have been scouring to find a cold brew or iced coffee maker and would love some recommendations/reviews. 

Yes, I have used the mason jar and all the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù contraptions in the past but they all turned out like garbage and after a few weeks of trial and error I would give up. Currently I am an instant coffee person because it is the fastest way I can cool down coffee and it taste way better then the mason jar set up. So really I am here to figure out how I can upgrade. 

I am looking for something used via Facebook market place and these are some of the options I see available. However, please do not be limited by these. I am an avid Facebook market finder so I am willing to wait for a specific product. 

Nespresso by Breville: https://www.breville.com/en-us/product/bnv220

Ninja DualPro: https://www.ninjakitchen.com/products/ninja-dualbrew-pro-specialty-coffee-system-zidCFP301

Instant Pot: https://instantpot.com/products/instant-cold-brewer

My ideal set up is the following:
- Taste: current set up is instant coffee so I feel my ‚Äútaste‚Äù is basic. Also my coffee drink is really my Breakfest and I put milk, unflavored protein powder, magnesium, vitamin power, and a bit of creamer. However, strong flavor is important because of how much additional liquid/stuff I put into it. I actually do like the taste of coffee. 

- Caffeine: by doctors I have been told to limit my caffeine intake. So the benefit of instant coffee is that I can really measure out my caffeine intake. So something that can easily be measured is ideal (don‚Äôt think that is a problem across any of the options but just something I am cautious of) 

- Speed: Quick results are ideal and can be done in the morning versus the night before. 

- Profile/size: I don‚Äôt have a ton of counter top space so something low profile is ideal

- Cleanup: easy cleanup is essential as well. 

- Cost: I plan on getting this used so that is a bit irrelevant

I've been struggling with productivity for years, and I wanted to share some game-changing insights that completely transformed how I approach my daily tasks and goals.

First off, I discovered that motivation isn't really about waiting for inspiration to strike. It's more about building systems that make it easier to take action, regardless of how you feel. Think of it like brushing your teeth - you don't wait until you're ""motivated"" to do it, right? You just do it because it's part of your routine.

One of the biggest revelations for me came from reading ""Atomic Habits"" (which I'll talk more about later). The key is to start ridiculously small. Want to exercise more? Start with just one push-up. Want to read more? Read one page. These tiny actions might seem insignificant, but they're like planting seeds that grow into powerful habits.

Here's what's working for me:

1. Environment design: I removed Instagram from my phone and put my workout clothes next to my bed. Making good choices easier and bad choices harder.

2. Identity-based habits: Instead of thinking ""I need to work out,"" I started thinking ""I am becoming a healthy person."" This shift in identity makes decisions automatic.

3. Habit stacking: I linked new habits to existing ones. After I pour my morning coffee (existing habit), I write three things I'm grateful for (new habit).

4. Progress tracking: I use a simple habit tracker in my journal. There's something satisfying about not breaking the chain.

The game-changer for me was listening to ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear on Audible. It completely changed how I think about productivity and habit formation. The audiobook is packed with practical strategies that actually work in real life, not just theory.

Here's the best part - you can actually listen to it for free right now through Audible's 30-day trial: https://athometouch.com/atomichabits

I usually listen while doing mundane tasks like washing dishes or commuting. It's like having a personal productivity coach in your ear.

Remember, motivation isn't about dramatic changes or waiting for the perfect moment. It's about taking tiny steps consistently. Start small, be patient with yourself, and focus on systems rather than goals.

What worked best for me was combining these practical strategies with the deeper understanding of habit formation from the audiobook. When you understand why your brain works the way it does, making changes becomes so much easier.

Chapter 1

I‚Äôm lost. That is the only explanation why I am in the middle of nowhere. And this job, that seems too good to be true. But I couldn‚Äôt tell Rhonda that. Especially since I have been nagging her relentlessly to find me something to do. A job in our town doesn‚Äôt come by easily. A job like this comes once in a lifetime. Accommodation included. I‚Äôm either the luckiest I have ever been in my life or I am about to get kidnapped and no one would come looking for me. There would be no one to look for me anyway. If payment wasn‚Äôt already enticing, then the two week accommodation for the job really sealed the deal. Especially since I haven‚Äôt taken a shower in the three weeks since my aunt kicked me out. Washing yourself in the gas station sink doesn‚Äôt count. I pull up my phone, the cracked screen is making it harder for me to navigate on it but it does it‚Äôs job. And either way, I have two dollars to my name, so I can‚Äôt afford to replace it. My phone tells me I am in the right place but it can‚Äôt be right. Trees everywhere and a dirt road. Maybe this was just a prank. I rest my forehead on the wheel, it‚Äôs coolness calming me. I perk up at the sound of another car coming this way. In the rearview mirror I see a red Jeep coming this way. There‚Äôs enough room for both of us and I hope I can ask them where I am. I roll my window down. And luckily I don‚Äôt even have to signal to the car because it stops right next to me. The car is so clean that I cringle looking at the dust on mine. As if the dust is the only tell that I am poor as dirt. The window comes down in a smooth motion, unlike mine, which I have to roll down using a lever that cuts into my skin, because the plastic part of it fell off long ago. And the tape I rolled around it is coming apart again too. My life is coming apart. Or it has always been crumbling around me. But until three weeks ago I had a place to stay.  

‚ÄúMorning' young lady‚Äù A man with grey hair and a cowboy hat greets me. He tips his hat and I follow suit by lowering my chin. Politeness is something I am not familiar with. I blush slightly. ‚ÄúAre you the new maid Anthony hired?‚Äù My blush deepens. I guess if I were to see myself from another‚Äôs eyes I would look like a maid too. 

‚ÄúGood morning, I am the new model mister Anthony Bordein hired. But I seem to be lost.‚Äù No surprise in his eyes at my words. He instead nodded approvingly. 

‚ÄúApologies. He‚Äôs been looking for a maid for some time now. I didn‚Äôt mean to imply anything.‚Äù He must have read everything in my eyes. I just waved him off as if it was nothing. He looked forward and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to get lost the first time you come here, but once you get to the house you‚Äôll find your way out easily. I‚Äôll drive ahead and show you. I‚Äôm George.‚Äù I smile politely. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Anna.‚Äù I fidget in my seat. 

‚ÄúNice to meet you Anna.‚Äù He said and took off right away. 

He drives ahead and stops as if knowing it would take my car several tries to start. I swear under my breath as the car finally starts. If he had to tow me I would probably just dig a hole and crawl into it. But meeting him put to rest some of my worries that the man who hired him might be a psychopath who wants to eat me alive. After driving for a few minutes George takes a right turn that I missed the first time. This time I noticed the wooden plank. Number 156 written not on any wooden plank but on one that I could tell was high quality. Some sort of smooth wood. It was easy to miss as it blended in the foliage around it. Soon enough we existed the thick of the forest that revealed a giant driveway that stood in front of what I can only describe as a mansion. A very elegant mansion made out of exposed brick. Surrounded by a beautiful landscape. Flower beds, trees of different colors and shapes, statues and small bird fountains. All blending together creating a beautiful garden tableau. I felt very out of place. I washed myself as best as I could this morning and even wore my cleanest tank top. A white one. My bra did not dry from when I washed it last night. Luckily I had the classic model body that lacked any curves so I didn‚Äôt find it vulgar or too revealing when I wore no bra. My jeans have not been washed in ages but jeans don‚Äôt need to be washed that often. Right? I wore no makeup because I had none either way. I was proud that I washed my hair that has always been my best feature and I didn‚Äôt need to fret about it because it just needed to be washed and my curls set themselves. The job mentioned they will provide outfits and makeup. I just needed to show up. So here I was. Standing in front of this gorgeous mansion. I didn‚Äôt even know a place like this existed in Elkins.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs where I am leaving you.‚Äù George said by way of goodbye. I looked at him wearily ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in charge of transportation. I have to pick up an item and deliver it to Morgantown. Ring the doorbell. Anthony should be home.‚Äù He waved and walked off to the side of the house. I took a deep breath and puffed it out. The house was beckoning, its enticing feel made my feet move finally. Two weeks in this place. I probably have my own room. Hell, even a closet would do as long as I had access to a bathroom. What I wouldn‚Äôt give for a bath. I never had one. My aunt's house had a shower. If you can call a sink with a shower hose tied to it a shower. 

One foot in front of the other I went up the four step stairs that led to the front door. The large mahogany door stood tall in front of me. I ran my hand down the smooth wood. I rang the doorbell. Two weeks here and I would be able to drive North to New York. I would have enough money for gas, food and I could couch surf until I got a serious gig. I waited. The door opened finally. 

‚ÄúCaleb, make sure that order went through. They called again complaining that the website is not letting them order.‚Äù A man in his late 30‚Äôs opened the door, half turned, talking to someone named Caleb. He faced me, his piercing blue eyes full of mischief. A smirk on his face as he took me in. His raven hair was cut short. He was handsome. The kind of rugged handsome that would make any girl's knees weak but not mine. 

‚ÄúHi there, you must be Anna. Come on in.‚Äù He said and turned around, I followed him inside and closed the door behind me. He was walking fast, I barely had time to take in my surroundings. The house was furnished and decorated with taste. White marble floors, wood furniture, minimalist but cozy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Anthony. I‚Äôm the one who talked to Rhonda.‚Äù He said as he entered the kitchen area. Another man. Younger. In his 20‚Äôs sat at a kitchen island. A laptop in front of him. His dark eyes lifted and looked at me, then right back at his laptop. ‚ÄúThis is Caleb. He‚Äôs my business partner slash photographer slash web designer.‚Äù Caleb didn‚Äôt say anything or even acknowledge me. ‚ÄúDo you want something to drink? Coffee, tea?‚Äù He opened the fridge and looked inside. ‚ÄúOrange juice?‚Äù He lifted a bottle of orange juice, his eyebrows lifted? The smirk on his face remained there at all times. 

‚ÄúCoffee please.‚Äù I stood there not knowing what to do with myself. Anthony took the orange juice bottle and headed to the kitchen counter. He opened a cupboard and pulled out a white porcelain cup that had a small plate. ‚ÄúLatte?‚Äù He asked and looked over his shoulder. I nodded. He started work on a coffee machine. One of the big ones that you see in a nice coffee shop. He steamed the milk and even made a small heart in the coffee. He handed me the coffee cup and winked at me. I had to look away. He was extremely charming. I placed my cup on the kitchen island opposite from Caleb. Who was now watching me under his eyebrows. His decadent mouth slightly open. But no expression on his face, no tell in his eyes. He met my eyes, realizing I could see him staring and he looked away. His jaw clenched. I cleared my throat and straightened realizing that I am being assessed. However his granite face doesn‚Äôt indicate if he likes what he sees. Anthony placed two clear glasses of orange juice on the island and then took a seat next to Caleb. 

‚ÄúIs the coffee to your liking?‚Äù He asked as I was taking a sip. I placed the cup down and smiled as I liked my lower lip. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs delicious. Thank you.‚Äù His half smirk extended to his eyes as he looked at my lips for a fraction of a second then looked away towards the coffee machine. 

‚ÄúNew addition. Getting anything delivered out here is a pain. After so many lost deliveries I decided to become a barista myself.‚Äù He grinned widely. I giggled. Giggled. He was devastatingly charming. I took a deep breath well aware of the fact that I was not wearing a bra. But to my surprise he averted looking anywhere else but in my eyes. 

‚ÄúTell me about yourself Anna.‚Äù Anthony asked, sipping his orange juice. Caleb kept typing. There‚Äôs nothing about me that‚Äôs interesting. 

‚ÄúWhat would you like to know?‚Äù I averted his eyes and instead looked around at the kitchen. It was a modern farmhouse design. I knew because I saw it in a magazine in Rhonda‚Äôs office. Not much decorations. As if they just moved here. 

‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù He looked around as well. ‚ÄúWe just moved in a month ago. I didn‚Äôt get around to decorating.‚Äù I nodded. 

‚ÄúI was born here in Elkins. Never left.‚Äù His accent told me he‚Äôs not from here. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Boston and Caleb here is from L.A.‚Äù my eyebrows rose in a silent questioning. ‚ÄúWe moved here because I like the quiet. And with our new business I can work from anywhere.‚Äù I looked toward Caleb who lifted his eyes for a second. 

‚ÄúWhy here?‚Äù In the middle of nowhere. Why move somewhere where I can‚Äôt wait to leave. If I had money and a choice Elkins would be the last place on earth I would move to. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cheesy but I like John Denver. Country roads is my comfort song. I wanted to know what it truly felt like to live in West Virginia.‚Äù I almost snorted. Cheesy indeed. But I gave him a polite smile and an understanding nod. 

‚ÄúDo you do anything else besides modeling?‚Äù I considered it. 

‚ÄúDoes working part time at McDonalds count?‚Äù Caleb snorted. Anthony gave him a sidelong glance. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre funny. I like you.‚Äù He said and got up. I guess my life could be considered funny. If modeling fails I will consider comedy for rich people.

‚ÄúRhonda informed you what we expect of you I hope.‚Äù He stopped at the door. I got up and followed him. He continued down the hallway. Rhonda did tell me but she said I should kiss her feet for this job and if I screw it up she‚Äôll never find me another job again. 

‚ÄúWe need someone to pose with our new models and test them.‚Äù I stopped in my tracks. Anthony turned, his head tilted to the side. 

‚ÄúTest them?‚Äù He must be joking. Rhonda didn‚Äôt mention that. He sighed deeply.

‚ÄúSo I guess she did not tell you everything. Well before you refuse, let me show you what I am talking about.‚Äù I chewed on my cheek nervously. Am I supposed to test them in front of him or them? Am I supposed to test them and answer a questionnaire? I didn‚Äôt know which one was worse. Damn you Rhonda. The dream of going to New York in two weeks evaporated. And I quit my shift at McDonalds too. It would have been fine if I didn‚Äôt throw my apron in my manager's face and told him: aux revoir. So I sighed deeply and followed Anthony without a word. Until we reached a door that he opened leading downward to what I could only assume was a basement. This is either a joke or I am still dreaming in my car. He turns on the stairlight. And steps down. I freeze and look as he goes downstairs. I should run. I should turn around, jump in my car and drive as far as I can and never look back. Except I‚Äôm almost out of gas. Getting lost here wasted my chance to even make it back to town. I swallow once, twice and I step down, down into a basement. Rhonda knows where I am, but will she even care to look for me if I go missing? I doubt it. I keep a healthy distance from him. Maybe I can sense if there‚Äôs danger and make it up the stairs in time. The basement opens into a wide space. The reddish dim lighting inside makes my heart pump inside my head. I should have ran, I have no sense of danger. I just follow anyone who gives me a kind smile and a cup of coffee. I‚Äôm pathetic. I deserve to die if that‚Äôs what this day has in store for me. 

I stop in my stacks three stairs up from the bottom. Anthony opens the light. The room looks normal in this lighting. Normal except the strange swings and tables laying around. 

‚ÄúRhonda said you sell sex toys.‚Äù I say with confusion. Anthony took a seat on the edge of a table cushioned with fine white leather. He crossed his muscled arms. I looked around the room instead of at him. 

‚ÄúSex toys?‚Äù He huffed a laugh. ‚ÄúI guess you could call them toys. These are high end sex furniture.‚Äù My eyes widened. ‚ÄúFor light bondage and increasing comfort and depth.‚Äù He winked and smiled, biting his tongue. My blush deepened. 

‚ÄúAnd how exactly am I supposed to test this‚Ä¶ furniture?‚Äù I swallowed the lump in my throat. My heart was pounding hard but not from nerves. 

‚ÄúI guess Rhonda didn‚Äôt tell you anything of use.‚Äù I shook my head. He sighed as he stood and headed to the side of the room towards an intricate swing. ‚ÄúThis is a sex swing. It helps with deeper penetration and makes bouncing easier. The upside of this is that it is very comfortable because of the quality cushioning. And it looks great in your bedroom.‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt wrong, the hanging part was made out of braided rope and white leather. ‚ÄúAnd it can be used for bondage as well.‚Äù He stuck his finger on the side of the rope and it unraveled in a very satisfying way. I was actually impressed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll sit in it. Caleb will take a few photos and videos of you swinging. And as for testing you‚Äôll need to talk about how comfortable you are in it and maybe I'll ask you some other questions that come to my mind. Is that something you‚Äôre comfortable with?‚Äù I stared at him gaping. He waited. The things that went through my mind as I walked down here were‚Ä¶ Well, let‚Äôs say that I feel embarrassed for actually considering them. But this. 

‚ÄúAm I going to be wearing anything?‚Äù His eyebrows perked. 

‚ÄúYes, of course. The pictures will be tasteful. And the videos will be sent only to clients who request them. Usually we don‚Äôt need them.‚Äù A sigh of relief left my body. 

‚ÄúThen yes, I am comfortable with the pictures and videos.‚Äù He grinned wide and he clapped his hands once as he stepped close to me and clasped my shoulders. I looked up at him, my heart was pounding again. 

‚ÄúPerfect. I was worried for a moment. And I did not want to have to deal with Rhonda again. No offense.‚Äù He grimaced. I smiled.

‚ÄúNone taken. I hope I won‚Äôt have to deal with her after this either.‚Äù He looked at me with consideration and nodded. 

‚ÄúCome. I‚Äôll show you to your room.‚Äù I followed him up the stairs. 

‚ÄúWhy two weeks with accommodation? Not that I‚Äôm complaining. I could use the money.‚Äù And accomodation. But I didn‚Äôt say that. He turned off the light to the stairwell and closed the door. 

‚ÄúI have five different swings to test and I didn‚Äôt think about installing them all and there‚Äôs no room for more than one. So I need to wait for the handyman to come by and change them every two, three days. And we have the massage tables and other pieces I want to photograph. And Rhonda mentioned if I can offer you accommodation because it takes an hour to get here.‚Äù That was something I didn‚Äôt expect from Rhonda. Especially since I begged her to let me sleep on her office couch and she kicked me out. I should send her a thank you note when I leave Elkins.

Anthony led me up a staircase to the second floor. There were so many doors that I wondered why he even bought a house this big. Maybe he has a family. He stops in front of a door and opens it. He gestures for me to go inside. I swallow a whimper. The room is‚Ä¶I tried my best not to tear up in front of Anthony. The room was decorated in soft beige and burgundy with golden accents. The bed was a dream - a four poster bed full of ornate pillows and a beautiful throw in burgundy, bleu, cream and toffee, that I imagined I would wrap myself in as I sipped my tea by the cozy window seat that I spotted. 

‚ÄúThis is where I leave you. I hope the room is to your liking. This one is the most colorful out of all the bedrooms in the house.‚Äù I turned to face him, my smile was genuine, although I tried not to look too grateful. I didn‚Äôt want him to know I have been sleeping in my car for close to three weeks. 

‚ÄúThank you. It‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù He nodded absentmindedly, as if something important was tugging at him. 

‚ÄúThe bathroom is through that door.‚Äù He pointed and then he was out of my room before I could blink. I opened my mouth to ask him when we‚Äôre going to start but it was too late. So instead I decided to explore the bathroom. I screamed excitedly as a bathtub stood mightily in the middle of the room. I turned on the faucet and ran my hands under it. The pressure of the water alone made me sigh loudly. I spent what could have been all afternoon in the bathtub, until my skin was so crinkly that I thought a moment longer in water and it would fall. I realized I left my bag in the car, but I had no change except for a pair of leggings and a t-shirt. I Iaid in the middle of the bed in my towel, considering if I should just wear the jeans and shirt I came in and run to my car to get my bag. But the thought of putting my old clothes back on after I scrubbed every inch of my body made me feel disgusted. 

Suddenly a knock on the door awoke me from my thoughts. I jumped off the bed and opened the door wide. In my towel with no regards about it or where I was. Caleb sat there, with a bored look on his face. I closed the door leaving it open just a sliver and hid behind it.

‚ÄúThere are fresh clothes in the closet. Wear the purple outfit and leave your hair like this.‚Äù I touched my hair, it was wet and ruffled. ‚ÄúNo makeup needed. I‚Äôll see you downstairs in 10 minutes.‚Äù And left.

1h4zslo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1h4zslo/the_most_wonderful_time_of_the_year/,The most wonderful time of the year ...,"... is THIS time of the year, right now, sandwiched between Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday break. Probably not a popular opinion, but here's why I LOVE late November through late December:

**1) Unstructured time -** Yes, there's a lot of grading: final papers, exams, assignments, and the like. But I can do it wherever and (to a large extent) whenever I want. Early morning in the coffee shop? No problem! Late afternoon in my office with the door closed because even fewer people than usual show up to bother me? Check! Late, late night when everyone else is asleep, at my dining room table? Just try to stop me!

**2) Social decompression -** I'm an introvert; I love the idea of people and big social gatherings. Ironic that I've chosen a profession that requires me to perform in front of an often indifferent audience twice a week during the semester, but here we are. I've worked hard to get better at teaching but it still takes work and exacts a toll in terms of mental labor. That being the case, I'm very happy for the time away from the classroom - which also helps to re-energize me for the next term.

**3) Social decompression redux -** Related to point 2) above, we're now in that sweet spot before the holidays with the many social obligations that they entail. Don't get me wrong; I'm grateful for family and friends and the time we can spend together, but in the moment these gatherings can get overwhelming. I love the fall/winter social liminal space.

That's all. Hope everyone is enjoying a good approaching end to the semester!",12,1733159030.0,Professors,2,0.93,False

Forget Christmas lights; the glow of my laptop screen at 3 a.m. is the real festive vibe. Strath students, unite! Or, more accurately, scatter across five different levels of the library, avoiding eye contact like we‚Äôre in some sort of academic Hunger Games.

Now, let me set the scene for those lucky enough to have lives outside of this academic abyss.

Picture me, **AJ**, a lone warrior armed with nothing but my questionable time management skills and a flat can of Red Bull. I‚Äôve claimed my spot on the *quiet floor*‚Äîbecause nothing says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm prepared for this exam‚Äù like passive-aggressively shushing people who dare to breathe too loudly.

**The Exam Season Starter Pack:**

1. **A questionable sleep schedule**: The library is open 24 hours, so why not my brain? Who needs a circadian rhythm when you‚Äôve got panic as a substitute?

1. **Snacks that scream desperation**: Yesterday, I ate an entire pack of Tesco value cookies because I didn‚Äôt want to lose my seat to that one guy who walks around like he‚Äôs scouting for chess opponents.

1. **A water bottle I haven‚Äôt refilled in three days**: Hydration is for the weak. Or at least for people not cramming 12 weeks of content into 12 hours.

1. **Caffeine dependency that should be studied by medical professionals**: My bloodstream is 80% coffee at this point. When the library caf√© closes, I briefly consider brewing instant coffee in the bathroom sink. (Don‚Äôt judge me‚Äîit‚Äôs a dark time. Literally. It‚Äôs 4 a.m.)

**The People You Meet During 24-Hour Library Time:**

* **The Overachiever**: They‚Äôve got their color-coded notes, their 3-month study plan, and a look of pity for the rest of us who are speed-reading lecture slides from 2019. I salute you, but also, how dare you?

* **The Group Project Ghosts**: A gaggle of students arguing over who‚Äôs responsible for the part of the presentation no one understands. They take up a whole table. No one‚Äôs even typing.

* **The Procrastinator‚Äôs Redemption Arc (me)**: You‚Äôll find me furiously typing out flashcards I‚Äôll never look at again, pretending I can make up for 12 weeks of Netflix binges in one caffeine-fueled night.

* **The Sleeper**: There‚Äôs always one brave soul who gives in to exhaustion and straight-up sleeps on the desk. If this is you, I respect your priorities.

**The Emotional Roller-coaster:**

Hour 1: ‚ÄúThis is fine. I‚Äôve got plenty of time.‚Äù  
Hour 4: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand this topic, but it can‚Äôt be that important, right?‚Äù  
Hour 7: Googling ‚ÄúCan you pass an exam by sheer force of will?‚Äù  
Hour 10: Contemplating life decisions, career paths, and whether running away to the Highlands would really be so bad.

At some point, the panic subsides into a strange kind of acceptance.

Sure, I might fail, but at least I‚Äôll fail *with flair.* As **AJ**, it‚Äôs my personal brand to make everything slightly more dramatic than it needs to be. So if you see someone dramatically flipping through notes at 3 a.m., muttering ‚ÄúThis is fine‚Äù like a mantra‚Ä¶ yeah, that‚Äôs probably me.

  
To my fellow Strath warriors,

May your caffeine be strong, your Wi-Fi stable, and your exam questions miraculously align with the 5% of the syllabus you skimmed. If you see me, **AJ**, in the library, say hi‚Äîor just nod solemnly as we pass like ships in the night, bonded by shared academic despair.

Good luck, everyone. We‚Äôre all in this beautifully chaotic mess together.

It was when I was a new born-again Christian (I still am somewhat but it's complicated). I also don't dream very much, and when I do, it's just mundane stuff sourced from day to day life stuff, very disjointed, boring and not very vivid. This dream was a bit more clear and put together.

**My dream:**

* I was being chased through a complex tunnel system by several military looking men dressed in black and white digital camouflage style suits. Eventually they caught me. 

* I then found myself in a bright white lounge-type room and I was holding a white Styrofoam looking cup which had dark brown/black liquid in it (kinda like concentrated coffee). I don't know if I had drank any of it or not, but it wasn't very full at all.

* A skinny young blonde girl dressed in white with pale skin was suddenly there next to me and spoke this to me: *""You cannot trust in God and angels.""*

That was the end of the dream. It's baffled me for years until recently as I've been learning about the whole Prison Planet thing... I was always thinking, if that was the enemy, why would they make it so obvious? I just wish I knew who the girl was and what the actual meaning of the dream was.

It was cold, but not the kind of cold you joke about over coffee. This was a sharp, personal cold, like winter itself had an axe to grind and chose you as the target.

And I, a reasonably rational adult, stood barefoot and nearly naked on a dock, preparing to leap into a lake that was barely shy of frozen.

This was cold so biting it didn‚Äôt just nip at your nose; it took a chunk out and kept chewing.

This whole ordeal was for charity, they said. A noble cause, sure, but as I stood there shivering, I couldn‚Äôt help but think: surely there are warmer ways to raise money. Maybe something involving quilts?

I wasn‚Äôt alone in this madness. My partner in crime for the day was a radio DJ. His name was Buster ‚Äî great guy, solid laugh, but not exactly someone I‚Äôd been dying to hold hands with while hurling myself into Arctic waters. Yet, there we were, being gently pressured by some overly enthusiastic organizer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll make a great picture,‚Äù she said, like that was supposed to be convincing.

And the snow? North Carolina snow isn‚Äôt the picturesque, fluffy postcard type. It‚Äôs a messy marriage of ice and mud, bound together in frigid hostility, sticking around like a bad houseguest until April.

Someone, clearly more prepared for life than me, had hauled a hot tub to the scene, which raised more questions than it answered. Who has a portable hot tub? How did they even plug it in out here? And more importantly, why didn‚Äôt I think of it first?

The lake itself was being monitored by a team of police divers. They bobbed in the water like penguins in full scuba gear, ready to spring into action should anyone decide to take their plunge a little too literally. Their presence didn‚Äôt inspire much confidence. The fact that a dive team was even necessary suggested there was a non-zero chance of catastrophe. But hey ‚Äî charity.

When it was our turn, I trudged onto the dock with all the enthusiasm of a man walking to his own execution. I looked at Buster, who nodded, his face a mix of determination and deep, existential regret. Then, with all the grace of a pair of newborn giraffes, we jumped.

The moment I hit the water; it was as if I‚Äôd been punched by winter itself. The cold didn‚Äôt just envelop me; it attacked. It was sharp, electric, a voltage of pure ice. My lungs rebelled immediately, sucking in a desperate gasp that only made things worse. Somewhere beneath the shock and the pain, my brain sent up a casual observation: I should have stayed in bed.

Underwater, the world turned blurry and surreal. I opened my eyes, because why not, and saw the distorted shapes of the dive team hovering like ghostly dolphins. The lake water, murky and bitter, stung every part of me it touched. I wasn‚Äôt sure whether I was swimming or just flailing, but I managed to spot Buster. His eyes were wide enough to double as headlights.

We burst out of the water, hacking and wheezing. Somehow, we didn‚Äôt need the dive team; apparently, my heart was still doing its job. Instinct took over, and every molecule in my body was screaming¬†*OUT.*¬†When we reached the shore, we tiptoed across the frozen slush like idiots, but that didn‚Äôt last long. Within seconds, we were full-on sprinting, barefoot, through a cocktail of snow, mud, and whatever else lives near lakes in winter, all of it stabbing at our feet like tiny daggers. The hot tub loomed ahead like the gates of paradise, steam curling up like it was saying,¬†*Come on, dummies, I‚Äôm right here.*¬†Every step hurt worse than the last, but the promise of those bubbling jets pulled us forward like a carrot dangling in front of a couple of freezing, desperate donkeys.

When we finally climbed in, it was as if we‚Äôd been granted access to heaven. If that‚Äôs what the womb feels like, I understand why babies start crying the moment they leave it.

The next day, our picture was in the local paper. Two dripping fools, frozen and red-faced, caught mid-laugh in what might‚Äôve been joy but was more likely mild hypothermia. The headline framed it as an act of courage, a testament to community spirit. I stared at the photo for a while, trying to pinpoint what exactly drove people like Buster, and the divers, and the guy with the inexplicably portable hot tub ‚Äî to do something this absurd in the name of helping others.

Standing on that dock, knowing full well how miserable it was going to be, wasn‚Äôt about the cold or the pictures or even the awkward hand-holding. I think it was about saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do something uncomfortable if it helps make someone else‚Äôs life a little easier.‚Äù

Sometimes in charity, the discomfort is the point.

Why do humans do these things? And not just jumping into frozen lakes, but baking pies, running races, and enduring never-ending charity dinners. Like the pie thing?¬†*I totally get*, but the unpleasant stuff?

It‚Äôs not really about the unpleasantness, or the pie eating, or the shaving-your-head-while-in-a-dunk-tank-at-the-kissing-booth; it‚Äôs about quietly saying, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre in this together.‚Äô

Sometimes, that spirit shows up as a plate of cookies at a bake sale. Other times, it‚Äôs a guy in a swimsuit plunging into icy water in the dead of winter.

And that‚Äôs fine.

Because, really, how can anyone genuinely appreciate warmth without knowing what it feels like to be cold?",1,1733158759.0,creativewriting,1,1.0,False

I got way more than I could eat, but hey, leftovers! I got the bacon grilled cheese with tomato basil soup, and my husband got the spicy bacon cheeseburger. Both came with potato salad, pickle spear, and homemade (and seasoned) chips. Everything was made in-house and fresh, and that was absolutely reflected in the 100% delicious taste of the food.

I recently got my hands on the MX Anywhere 3 mouse from Logitech. This compact device is made for Mac users who need a reliable mouse on the go.

The MX Anywhere 3 feels great in my hand. Its low profile and soft silicone grips make it comfy to use for hours. I'm impressed by how well it tracks on different surfaces - even glass! The scroll wheel is smooth and precise, letting me zip through long documents quickly.

Battery life is a strong point. I only need to charge it every couple of months with normal use. A quick 1-minute charge gives me 3 hours of power in a pinch. The mouse connects to my Mac via Bluetooth or the included USB-C cable.

I like that I can customize the buttons for different apps. This speeds up my workflow in programs like Photoshop and Excel. The ability to switch between three devices with one click is handy too.

# Bottom Line

The MX Anywhere 3 is a solid choice for Mac users who want a portable, high-quality mouse. Its comfort, versatility, and long battery life make it great for work on the go.



# Unveiling the Logitech MX Anywhere 3 for Mac

I recently got my hands on the MX Anywhere 3 and was impressed by its sleek design. This compact mouse packs a punch with its MagSpeed scroll wheel. I found it super smooth and precise. The low-profile shape fit comfortably in my palm, and the silicone grips felt nice.

What stood out to me was how well it worked on different surfaces. I tested it on my desk, a glass table, and even my couch arm - no issues at all. The battery life is great too. I've been using it for weeks without needing to charge.

One cool feature is the ability to connect to three devices. I switch between my MacBook and iPad with just a button press. The customizable buttons are handy for speeding up tasks in apps like Photoshop.

While it's a bit pricey, I think the MX Anywhere 3 is worth it for Mac users who want a reliable, versatile mouse.

# MagSpeed Electromagnetic Scrolling

The MX Anywhere 3's scrolling is impressive. I found the MagSpeed wheel fast and precise. It's quiet too, which is nice when working in shared spaces. The wheel shifts smoothly between ratchet and hyper-fast modes. This lets me zip through long documents or web pages in seconds. But I can still stop exactly where I want. The precision is great for detailed work like spreadsheets or design tasks.

The scroll wheel is made of steel, giving it a quality feel. It's one of my favorite features on this mouse. The electromagnetic technology makes scrolling feel smooth and responsive. I can scroll through 1,000 lines quickly or move pixel by pixel for fine control. This versatility is really useful in my daily work.

# Ergonomic Design for Supreme Comfort

The MX Anywhere 3 fits my hand like a glove. Its low-profile design and compact size make it perfect for on-the-go use. I love the ultra-soft silicone side grips - they feel great and help me keep a secure hold. The mouse is light enough to move easily but has enough weight to feel solid. Its buttons are well-placed and easy to click. I can use this mouse for hours without discomfort. The scroll wheel is smooth and precise. While it's a bit small for all-day desktop use, it's ideal for travel and laptop work. The pale grey color looks sleek too.

# Advanced Tracking on Any Surface

I tested the MX Anywhere 3 on a variety of surfaces, and I'm impressed by its tracking abilities. The mouse worked flawlessly on my desk, couch armrest, and even directly on glass. This is thanks to its high-precision 4000 DPI sensor. I found I could work comfortably anywhere without needing a mousepad. The mouse glides smoothly, making precise movements easy. Its compact size is great for tight spaces or travel. While small, it still felt comfortable in my hand during extended use. The tracking is responsive and accurate, which helped boost my productivity. Overall, the MX Anywhere 3 lives up to its name as a go-anywhere mouse.

# USB-C Quick Charging Technology

I found the USB-C charging on this mouse to be super handy. It's fast and easy to use. I plugged it in for just a minute and got enough juice for 3 hours of use. That's great when I'm in a hurry. The full charge takes about an hour, which isn't bad at all. I like that I can keep working while it charges. The battery lasts a long time too - up to 70 days on a single charge. That means I don't have to worry about it dying in the middle of a project. The USB-C port is sturdy and fits snugly. Overall, the charging setup on this Logitech mouse is quick and reliable.

# Customizations to Enhance Workflow

I found the MX Anywhere 3 really shines when it comes to customization. The mouse lets me set up buttons to do exactly what I need. I use Photoshop a lot, and it was great to see preset profiles for that and other apps like Premiere Pro. But I didn't stop there - I made my own tweaks too. The Flow feature is a game-changer. I can move stuff between my Mac and iPad super easily. It's like having one big workspace. The side buttons are handy for going back and forth in my browser. And that scroll wheel? I can switch between click-by-click and super-fast modes on the fly. It's smooth as butter. These little touches make my work so much quicker.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this compact mouse for a while now, and it's definitely made a difference in my daily work. Let's break down what I've found to be good and not-so-good about the Logitech MX Anywhere 3.

# Pros

* The MagSpeed scrolling is amazing. I can zip through long documents super fast or go line-by-line with precision.
* It works on any surface, even glass. I've used it on my desk, couch, and even a glass coffee table without issues.
* Battery life is great. I only charge it every couple of months.
* It's really comfortable to hold, even for long periods.
* The customizable buttons are handy. I've set them up for different apps I use often.
* Switching between devices is simple. I use it with my MacBook and iPad.

# Cons

* It's on the small side. If you have large hands, it might not be the best fit.
* The price is a bit high compared to simpler mice.
* Some users might find the scroll wheel too sensitive at first.
* It doesn't have a place to store the USB receiver, which could be easy to lose.
* The software needed for full customization isn't pre-installed on Macs.

I've found this mouse to be a great tool for both work and play. It's not perfect, but its pros definitely outweigh the cons for my needs.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using this mouse for a while now, and it's clear why it's so popular. The MX Anywhere 3 for Mac has gotten lots of positive feedback from users. Many people love how well it works with their Macs and iPads. The smooth tracking and comfortable feel get a lot of praise. Users like the quiet clicks and how easy it is to switch between devices. The long battery life is another big plus. Some folks say it's much better than Apple's Magic Mouse. A few users had issues with customizing settings, but most were able to fix this with Logitech's software. The small size is great for some, but others found it too compact. Overall, people seem very happy with this mouse, especially Mac users looking for a reliable wireless option.

# Conclusion

After using the MX Anywhere 3 for a while, I'm really impressed. This mouse works great with Macs and iPads, and even some Windows laptops. It's small but comfortable, and the scroll wheel is super smooth. The battery lasts a long time, and it's easy to recharge. While it might be a bit pricey, the quality makes it worth it. The clicks are quiet, and it tracks well on almost any surface. Some users might find it too small, but for me, it's just right for both office work and travel.

As i‚Äôve been reading and watching more to help me decide on my next machine, I‚Äôm currently siting at two main candidates- Mara X (HX machine) and Sage (Breville) Dual Boiler.

I have a few questions to help me decide what‚Äôs the right move for our household. A bit of info about us - prefer med to dark roasted coffee and have two milk drinks in the AM (more during the weekend) and an espresso/americano and a milky again for wife in the PM.

So my questions:
1. Anyone able to share their experience with Sage dual boiler in particular? I‚Äôve seen all the big name youtubers talk about it but want to hear from others more basic (?) users.
2. Getting a bit overwhelmed with the maintenance - I hear that it‚Äôs tricky to descale dual boilers and that they require regular services. Are people able to do that by themselves or you have to rely on a certified technician?‚Äù
3. Water - this one is even more overwhelming than maintenance but somewhat interconnected. Our house has plumbed in salt tablets water softener. Is that water ‚Äògood‚Äô (mostly for the scale part) for those machines? We also have a drinking water filter that‚Äôs on the hard water which does ‚ÄòCarbon, Taste & Odor Filter‚Äô according to the label. I‚Äôm confused what to use.
4. Other filters - in my Barista pro i use the claro swiss filters which I assume are applicable to the dual boiler as well and help with prolonging the descale needs? Similarly, i‚Äôve seen lelit have their own filters too.


As you could see, super overwhelmed trying to understand if the benefits of those machines are worth the hustle. Thank you a lot in advance! Happy brewing!",0,1733158525.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

I wanted to share my personal journey with Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides after using it consistently for the past 6 months.

**My Experience**

I mix one scoop daily in my morning coffee. The powder dissolves well in hot drinks but doesn't mix great with cold beverages. It's unflavored, which makes it versatile - I barely notice it in my coffee.

**Changes I've Noticed**

My nails have become noticeably stronger and grow faster than before. I used to have brittle nails that would break easily, but that's changed since I started taking this supplement.

My hair appears healthier and has grown longer. My skin feels softer and looks more refreshed, though the changes weren't dramatic.

**Joint Benefits**

I've experienced some improvement in joint comfort. While it's not a miracle cure, I feel less stiffness in my knees, especially after workouts.

**The Not-So-Great Parts**

The price point is higher compared to other collagen supplements. A container lasts about a month with daily use.

Some batches have shown consistency issues. I received one batch with an odd smell, which was disappointing.

**Usage Tips**

* Works best in hot drinks
* Start with a smaller dose to see how your body reacts
* Stay consistent with daily use
* Give it at least 2-3 months to see results

**Final Thoughts**

While I've seen positive results, they weren't immediate or dramatic. The improvements in my nails and hair are the most noticeable benefits. The joint benefits are subtle but valuable.

**Disclaimer:** This post is based on personal experience. Different people may have different results. This is not medical advice. Make your own informed decision about using supplements.

Just like the title says, I can't get a good espresso from my Dedica EC885.

Here's my whole setup:

* botomless portafilter with a basket from Amazon (fits perfectly, the basket looks simillar to IMS basket, which is yet to arrive)
* disc screen puck, wdt, stock tamper
* timemore c3 esp hand grinder
* freshly roasted (7+days), dark roast 100% arabica, which should have very little acidity. I also tried a medium-roast and the results were very simllar.

Here's what's happening:

My shots are always overly sour. If I grind finer, the machine chokes or the watter channels around the puck. Grind coarser, and shots are fast and thin.

I tried:

* reducing dose in the basket,
* pulling longer shots,
* temperature surfing using the steam button, preheating everything

And while some things help a little, overall all shots are still very acidic. Very little sweetness, and 0 bitterness (I can't get it to overextract). They all have good crema though.

I went through a whole bag of beans trying to dial in.

I invested all my current spare money for this setup. I'm so dissapointed and angry. I know this isn't how it's supposed to taste. I've had better coffee from some bean-to-cup machines.

1. I don‚Äôt like our area. It‚Äôs a far suburban area and I moved from the city. When I have a baby I want to be able to walk to coffee shops, go to mothers groups and be in an area where there lots of young couples. I think this is important for my mental health.
2. My father in law is too involved and messages my husband 24/7. When I have a baby I don‚Äôt want them to be to involved. I would definitely visit them but for me I need space with my own little family. 

My husbands fixed home loan doesn‚Äôt expire for two years. What are your thoughts on approaching this topic with my husband.

I know we can do things over and over. In fact, if it's gamified (like ‚Äòhow many days in a row can I do this?‚Äô), I can stick with something for a little while‚Äîbut I would never call it a routine or habit because it's never done consistently.

I've found that when I create any routine, I start rebelling against it. Maybe it's the lack of dopamine/excitement?

I've read countless books on habits, and from what I understand, once they are formed, they work like ‚Äòautopilot,‚Äô and you don't have to think about them.

I do nothing at the same time or in the same way. 

You hear things like ‚Äòhabit stacking‚Äô to connect a habit you want to form to an existing habit or routine‚Ä¶ and I can't think of a single thing. 

For example, I brush my teeth every morning, but sometimes it's when I first wake up, other times at 11 a.m. Sometimes, it's before the shower, other times after, and other times right before I run out the door. Sometimes, I do it twice because I can't remember if I brushed them or because I brushed before coffee and need to refresh. 

I don't think this is a bad thing. It keeps life interesting. However, it makes it difficult to build up small habits that will create significant results over time. I'm thinking about and using my brain to execute every little detail of my life.

Has anyone here created and stuck to routines or habits long-term?

1h4z7h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiFragranceAddicts/comments/1h4z7h9/everything_winter/,Everything Winter‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è,"https://preview.redd.it/9f8x8hg4rg4e1.png?width=2858&format=png&auto=webp&s=9016d725a2619f1bc50b31f64c544248ca2f3607



Winters are here and my dry parched asf skin can't live without some good moisturizers. It's officially the season where mists and perfumes last the longest‚ú® and also the season best suited for gourmand lovers like me! So here is my winter collection (left to right). 



1. Layer Wottagirl Vanilla Twist: A dupe of Warm Vanilla Sugar by Bath and Body Works, and I prefer this over WVS. WVS is very mild and I wouldn't pay 800 for the kind of performance most BBW mists have, especially recently with their enshitification. Vanilla Twist is my all time fav and I love it so much that I spray it in the summers too (yes idc I love gourmands way too much no matter the season). It smells very similar to Vaseline Cocoa body lotion and 'layers' well with it. Performs really well after maturing for a few months.

  
2. Bath and Body Works Pumpkin Swirl Cake: Smells like 'Gud ki Kheer.' Make of that what you will. I like it? It does settle into something yummy and cake-ish but still smells like gud ki kheer. Good longevity for a mist (3+ hours).

  
3. MCaffeine Choco Body Butter: I am having a hard time not eating it every time I open it. It smells EXACTLY like a chocolate cake batter or a chocolate cake in the oven. This is the kind of fragrance I expect from fragrance houses. It's also really thick and extremely moisturizing. Love love love it!

  
4. Nivea Cocoa Nourish Body lotion: My HG for years, the only lotion that saves my cracked skin in winters. Lovely cocoa fragrance.

  
5. Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa (decant): Beast mode performance. It has been 4 days since I sprayed it on my hoodie and I can still smell it when I go near the hoodie. It's a great fragrance but I don't get any coffee or vanilla, the top notes are cinnamon, cardamom and ginger and that's definitely what it smells like majorly. Warm and spicy.

  
6. Plum Smoking Vanilla EDP (decant): A really good dupe of Victoria's Secret Bare Vanilla Luxe (VS one is less smoky). I generally hate Plum because their vanilla vibes mist and oil both smell hideous and plasticky. But Smoking Vanilla is a good one and has good longevity too. Considering VS discontinued Bare Vanilla Luxe, I will be switching to Smoking Vanilla as an alternative, it's cheaper and performs better since it's an EDP so win-win. Glad to have found this. 

  
7. Victoria's Secret Bare Vanilla Luxe (decant): She's the queen, she's the diva, she's the star. My signature scent (besides Vanilla Twist) and sadly has been discontinued.

  
8. Himalaya Cocoa Butter Intensive Body Lotion: Smells really good but isn't moisturizing enough for winters. I keep this for scorching summers or sticky monsoon but if you don't live somewhere with harsh winters or have normal skin you can use it in winters.

  
9.  Muse Beauty Espresso Vanilla: The underdog of this shelf. Again, I don't get any coffee from it, but I do get other top notes it has like orange blossom, pear and also the middle note of jasmine. Those are the most prominent notes IMO. I've heard people say this smells exactly like YSL Black Opium (which it's a dupe of), I can't comment on that since I've never smelled Black Opium. Sadly, this perfume doesn't last at all on my skin, but lasts a whole day on clothes. I don't like spraying perfumes on my skin anyway so that's not a problem for me. It's a GORGEOUS scent and I will definitely be buying more form Muse Beauty the moment I have more money lol.

  
10. Dove Shea Butter and Warm Vanilla body wash: This smells creamy and milky; I want to eat it. However, it doesn't smell like vanilla at all, and it has a unique 'dove' scent iykwim. It's very mild, the mildest body wash scent from Dove that I've used (I've used 4 variants other than this one), the smell doesn't linger after you're out of the shower so this is just for a nice bath/shower experience. And ofcourse a bang for your buck since it's cheap asf and you get a whole litre.

I recently got my hands on the Razer Pro Click Mini, and I'm impressed with this compact wireless mouse. It's a great choice for anyone who needs a portable productivity tool they can take anywhere.

The Pro Click Mini lives up to its name with ultra-quiet clicking. I can use it in quiet spaces without disturbing others. The scroll wheel is versatile, letting me switch between smooth scrolling for long pages and precise clicks when I need more control. I like that I can connect it to multiple devices and switch between them easily.

https://preview.redd.it/z91vtfk1rg4e1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=889b07fae324d89a8e3c0ff84d8f649f8a342c56

While the mouse is small, it still feels solid. The buttons are responsive and can be customized to boost productivity. Battery life seems good so far. It tracks well on most surfaces I've tried.

I did notice the scroll wheel click can be a bit loud compared to the main buttons. The size might not suit everyone, especially those with larger hands. A few users have reported issues with the scroll wheel click after some use.

# Bottom Line

The Razer Pro Click Mini is a solid choice for a portable, quiet mouse. Its features make it great for productivity on the go.



# Overview of the Razer Pro Click Mini Portable Wireless Mouse

I've been using this compact mouse for a while now, and it's become my go-to for work on the go. The Pro Click Mini lives up to its name with its small size that easily fits in my bag. I love how quiet the clicks are - perfect for coffee shop work sessions. The scroll wheel is a standout feature, switching between smooth scrolling for long pages and precise clicks when I need them.

One thing to note is that it might feel a bit small if you have larger hands. The battery life has been great so far, lasting weeks without needing a charge. I can connect it to multiple devices, which is handy when switching between my laptop and tablet. While it's not the cheapest option out there, I think the quality and features make it worth considering for anyone who works on the move.

# Silent Mechanical Switches

I was impressed by how quiet this mouse is. The clicks are barely audible, making it perfect for office use or late-night work. I found the silent switches didn't affect performance - they still feel responsive and tactile. This feature really sets the Pro Click Mini apart from other mice I've used. The switches are built to last too, rated for up to 15 million clicks. While the silent clicks are great, I noticed the scroll wheel can be a bit louder when used quickly. Overall, the hushed operation is a standout feature that makes this mouse ideal for noise-sensitive environments.

# Ultimate Portability

I love how easy it is to take this mouse anywhere. The Pro Click Mini lives up to its name - it's super compact and lightweight at just 7 ounces. I can slip it into my laptop bag or even a pocket without adding bulk. The sleek white design looks great too. Battery life is impressive at nearly 600 hours, so I don't have to worry about it dying on the go. Being able to connect to 4 devices is handy when I'm switching between my work laptop, tablet, and home PC. The silent clicks are perfect for using in quiet spaces like libraries or coffee shops. While small, it still feels comfortable to use for extended periods.

# HyperScroll Technology

The scroll wheel on this mouse is a game-changer. I can switch between free-spin and tactile modes with ease. Free-spin is great for zipping through long web pages or documents. When I need precise control, I switch to tactile mode. The tilt-click feature for horizontal scrolling is handy too. I use it often when working on spreadsheets or wide documents. This versatile scroll wheel saves me time and makes navigation a breeze. It's smooth, responsive, and adapts to different tasks quickly. The HyperScroll tech is one of my favorite features on the Pro Click Mini. It's a big upgrade from standard scroll wheels I've used before.

# Multi-Device Connectivity

I found the Pro Click Mini's ability to connect to multiple devices really handy. I can pair it with up to 4 different devices using Bluetooth or the included dongle. Switching between my laptop, tablet, and desktop is quick and easy. This saves me time when I need to work across different screens. The mouse remembers the connections, so I don't have to re-pair it each time. It's nice not having to juggle multiple mice for different devices. The seamless switching is a big plus for my productivity. While 4 device connections is plenty for most users, some might want even more options.

# Programmable Buttons for Efficiency

I found the programmable buttons on this mouse to be a real game-changer. With 7 buttons I could customize, I set up shortcuts for my most-used programs and tasks. This let me work faster and cut down on repetitive clicking. I mapped copy, paste, and undo to buttons, which sped up my writing and editing. The buttons felt solid and responsive when I clicked them. While it took some time to learn my new button layout, once I did, my workflow became much smoother. The software to program the buttons was easy to use. I liked being able to create different button setups for different apps. This mouse helped me get more done in less time.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this compact wireless mouse for a while now, and it's made a big impact on my daily workflow. Let's dive into what makes it stand out and where it could use some improvement.

# Pros

* Silent clicks are a game-changer for quiet work environments
* Sleek design fits easily in bags for on-the-go use
* HyperScroll wheel offers smooth scrolling and precision when needed
* Connects to up to 4 devices, great for multi-tasking
* 7 programmable buttons boost productivity
* Accurate and responsive tracking

# Cons

* Might be too small for users with larger hands
* Scroll wheel can be noisy compared to the quiet clicks
* Some users report issues with the scroll wheel click after short use
* Battery life is unclear, as long-term testing is needed

I found the Pro Click Mini to be a solid choice for office and travel use. The silent clicks are a standout feature, making it perfect for shared workspaces or late-night work sessions. Its compact size is a double-edged sword - great for portability but potentially uncomfortable for larger hands.

The HyperScroll wheel is versatile, switching between free-spin and tactile modes. This comes in handy when browsing long documents or needing precise control. However, I noticed the wheel itself isn't as quiet as the main buttons.

Connectivity is a strong point. I can easily switch between my laptop, tablet, and TV without constant pairing. The programmable buttons are a nice touch, letting me set up shortcuts for my most-used tasks.

On the downside, there have been reports of the scroll wheel click failing after a short time. While I haven't experienced this myself, it's worth keeping in mind. Also, the jury's still out on battery life, as more long-term use is needed to fully assess it.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using this mouse for a while now, and it's clear why it has a 4.3-star rating from over 350 users. The Pro Click Mini lives up to its name with impressively quiet clicks. I found the accuracy and responsiveness top-notch, making it great for precise work. The scroll wheel is a bit loud at first, but I got used to it.

Some users with small hands really like the compact size, but it might feel tiny if you have larger mitts. Battery life seems solid based on most feedback. A few people had issues with the scroll wheel click not registering after a month, but this wasn't a widespread problem.

The mouse works well on various surfaces and connects to multiple devices easily. While most love the silent operation and precision, a small number of users reported sensor issues. Overall, it's a solid choice for quiet, portable use, but like any product, it's not perfect for everyone.

# Conclusion

After using the Pro Click Mini for a while, I'm impressed with its silent operation and compact design. It's a solid choice for travelers or anyone who needs a quiet mouse. The HyperScroll feature is handy, and connecting to multiple devices is a breeze. While it might be a bit small for larger hands, the precision and programmable buttons make up for it. Battery life seems good so far. There are some minor issues like a noisy scroll wheel, but overall, this Razer mouse delivers on its promises. It's not perfect, but it's a great option for those seeking a quiet, portable mouse with some advanced features.",1,1733157536.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

I left his place hurriedly when I woke up and did not report it as I was not sure what had happened and I just wanted to move on. He continued to try to contact me in the days following and began showing up at my door and with roses. I told him if he contacted me again I‚Äôd call the police. A couple weeks later I was arrested, he claimed to the police I was his fianc√©e and had threatened to ‚Äúruin his life and get him charged with rape.‚Äù The police showed up at my door and I told them they couldn‚Äôt arrest me because I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, the cop was mad when I said that and arrested me.

1h4z0oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifts/comments/1h4z0oq/gift_ideas_for_men/,Gift ideas for men,"Here's a random list I've compiled of different gift ideas that might work for many men.
These vary in price and are in no particular order. Some are more of a category rather than specific items and I'm trying to include some things that you might not see on every other gift idea list out there (some will be repeated though). I am a man writing this list and I know we can be hard to shop for and I don't care about a lot of the things I see on men's gift guides, so here's one that fits people like me better:



Nice desk fan. I get hot pretty easily, even in the winter (sometimes more in the winter than summer because places run the heat) and a nice desk fan at work or even at home would be nice for someone that uses a desk. Something compact, powerful, and quiet is ideal, and also make sure it has some different power settings. I hate when the lowest setting is too strong or the step between 2 settings is way too big.

Nice sunglasses (I like oakleys)

Shoes/boots (depends on what their style is but I personally would love a nice pair of leather or suede boots). Thursday Boots and Redwing Shoes are two good brands that come to mind for boots.

Nice belt (maybe something other than typical black or brown leather depending on their clothing style)

High quality coffee beans from a local roaster (try to find out what type of roast they like if they're a coffee drinker)

High quality beard trimmer or razor (not manscaped, brio beardscaped is a better option, or something by wahl)

Good beard products if they have a beard (Beard Octane is my favorite brand for my long beard). A bamboo detangling brush is also great for my beard!

Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones if they're into that and don't already have nicer ones (beats, bose, sony, etc)

Do they like tattoos? Maybe the tattoo shop they like has gift cards

Interior detail for their vehicle might be much appreciated (I know I'd love one in my truck since it's dirty from offroading and I work 2 jobs so no time to clean it myself)

Carhartt t-shirts or button up shirts may be a good option for many guys

Tickets to some even they're into (sports, concert, other interests, etc. I saw someone mention flying lessons despite not having a plane and thats a cool idea)

Home sound system if they don't have one (even just a nice soundbar is good)

High quality cookware if they like to cook (made-in and all-clad are two good brands that come to mind)

On that note, a nice big wood cutting board changed my life with cooking. Maybe include some cutting board oil for maintenance as well

A nice chef knife can be pricey but worth it. Another option in that realm is getting their current knives sharpened professionally. 

Do they like cigars? Try a sampler box of different cigars. A nice cutter and/or lighter is also a great option. Cigars Daily on youtube has good information about this.

Watches are always a great gift for a lot of men but make sure you know their tastes and they can get pricey.

Nice watch display case would be great too, ideally more than just the typcial box with a glass window on the top that most guys probably already have.

A full length mirror can be great to have if they don't have one already (and have the space for it)

A cool rc car can be a fun gift for a lot of guys that like cars and/or tinkering. Don't just get a basic $30 one from walmart though, as it will likely not get used or last. Brands like Traxxas and Axial have really cool high quality ones that can be tinkered with (or even built from scratch in an unassembled kit! This is really fun for people that love building stuff) and they will be a lot more fun to use and more likely to be used at all by the right guy. They can be pretty expensive but they start around $100 for a more basic one.

Legos are pretty popular right now and there are some pretty cool sets out there. There might be something that the guy in your life would love to build and display.

A high quality bag (i.e. real leather or canvas) could be a great gift if your guy uses a cheapo one for work/school/gym (backpack, messenger bag, duffel bag/weekender, etc). 


In general as an idea, upgraded/high end versions of stuff they already use often can be something they love and never knew they wanted. This can include sunglasses, shoes, razor/trimmer, knives, cookware, coffee makers, etc. Try to avoid gimmicky things that wouldn't really get used much and go for higher quality simple things that are actually useful. Simplicity is underrated! If any of these ideas stick out to you, I recommend doing a little bit of research on the best items for your budget and use case to make sure that you're not wasting your money before buying something. 

Also, most of these require knowing a decent amount about the recipient, so if you don't know them very well then a gift card to a store that they like is more often than not a pretty highly appreciated gift. Better than something they will never use and keep in a drawer forever.

Rent is $650 + all utilities included (electricity up to a monthly allowance).¬†

Here are a few pros and cons to keep it as real as can be for any possible interest:¬†

\-----------------

PROS:

\- 5-minute walk from Kroger (Grocery Store) 

\- listed as ‚ÄúOff Campus‚Äù housing but it‚Äôs only a 2-minute walk then you're right on campus

\- LGBTQ+ Friendly. 3 housemates 1 is my roommate, all are LGBTQ+ friendly and are super nice!¬† I would ask that if anyone is interested, you are LGBTQ+ friendly as well since my roommates are women and non-binary. Keeping the space as comfortable and safe for everyone living there is also a big priority of mine! 

\- Smoker friendly w/ minor regulations due to roommate having asthma. 

\- Included bathroom in the room

\- On-site laundry facilities

\- WiFi included¬†

\- Fully equipped kitchen

\- 24hr on-call staff¬†

\- Parking Garage available (msg for more details)¬†

\- In the center of Downtown Richmond, minutes from the School of the Arts and the VCU Siegel Center.¬†

\- Maintenance man named Shawn is wonderful. He has always been of great service to me and everyone else in the building. If you need something fixed, he'd be more than happy to and willing! 

\- Access to 1200 W Marshall Amenities (apartments are under Americancampus Group, which is why you get access): Yoga Studio, Educational, social, and recreational activities, Community kitchen with coffee bar, 24-hour recreation center with billiards, ping pong, and foosball, and 24-hour state-of-the-art fitness center with strength equipment, cardio machines, and free weights. 

\-----------------

CONS: 

\- Issue with mail delivery services. They have gotten better, but anything that is shipped through USPS somehow keeps getting sent to Ramz on Broad, and then it somehow ""disappears."" Annoying, I know. Amazon, UPS, and other delivery services come through just fine. 

\- Flimsy appliances. A few appliances like my towel rack fall or seem to be very loose and you can tell it was put up with no care. I'm not dealing with a constant irritation of things breaking, this has only happened once or twice. This is why Shawn is great! He comes and fixes everything and usually comes within 1-2 days of the service request being put in! 

\- Laundry. You have to pay for laundry, and there are only 2 washers/ 2 dryers on each floor. (4 floors) I never run into any issues with people and their laundry, I just know this isn't pleasant for most. There is an App called ""CSC Go"" that is for our laundry and you can put money on your account through there and also see which washers/dryers are available so you can avoid the whole laundry getting taken out or touched by another person's scandal. 

\-----------------

The lease starts on December 3rd until July 1st, 2025. You can move in at any time after December 3rd and will be required to pay the first month's rent prior to moving in. After receiving the first payment I'll give you the key and all will be well!

New to the group, just thinking out loud, i think i had a really bad episode last night. Is that what there called?

Over the past 6 months I been wondering if I have slight adhd or maybe im just organised and ordered but only sometimes. I have no idea, maybe im just anxious. Heres a few things iv noticed

Can't sit still, legs are shaking most of the time or if i. driving hands moving/twitching

I struggle to remember tasks at work without task cards (like post-it notes but online)

I also remeber taking some meds, once not prescribed and it helped me focus for hours, cant remember the name.

I need asmr to fall asleep, right now its 12:20am and i cant close my eyes, iv cut my coffee down to 2, from 4 but it doesnt make a difference in the slightest.

Last last I was cleaning my kitchen, needed to cook dinner, so I cleaned my airfry, washed it out and went back to the sink. Then i noticed the coffee was dirty, so I cleaned it out fully, flushed the machine, head and all. Then I walked through the house and picked up toys and clothes. Went back to the kitchen and continued to clean up. My partner then came out and aaked if put dinner on (I hadnt) cause I got distracted.

It was strange cause for about 2 hours around this time my head was feeling somewhat light and spacey (best i can explain it) 

I felt focussed on what i was doing but not here at the same time. 

At what point did you think or realise you had adhd? or was it like a oh shit.... maybe i should go do a test

USA.","* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** Less than $1,000 is ideal. 
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** I am open to it, but I would prefer new if possible. 
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  I would say my prioritization is: performance build quality, form factor and then battery life. As far as form factor goes, I would prefer a traditional laptop/ultrabook style, as I am not a fan of tablets or 2-in-1 style. I will mostly be using this laptop near a power outlet, so battery isn't my biggest concern. 
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not that important. I will use this somewhat ""on the go,"" (I.E: coffee shops, library, Amtrak) but it will be rather stationary once I am using it. Size doesn't matter  that much to me (heh heh heh)
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** N/A
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Adobe Premiere Pro is the number one piece of software that I want this laptop to use well. My main focus is making sure I can edit video as my job relies on it. Less of importance: I will also be using Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom for photo editing as well as audio software like Reaper to edit recorded drum tracks. 
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** I will still be mainly using my desktop PC to game, but it would admittedly kick a lotta ass if I could run Minecraft at a reasonable \~50-60 FPS on the go. 
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** A good keyboard would be nice -- the clickier, more mechanical-feel, the better. I would actually prefer no touch-screen. Not a fan of the Surface Pro vibe. A good trackpad never hurts, but I will mostly be using a mouse, so not the biggest priority. Don't care at all about finger print scanners or webcams. 
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** None of these are make-or-break and just something I figured I would mention, but more than 2 USB ports is always good. USB-A AND USB-C would be great, but I would prefer ALL USB-C over all USB-A for sure. I am not picky on screen size/specs, but I'll say the bigger the better, just for my poor eyesight. Also, these may be a thing of the past and I am probably just super out of touch, but an SD card reader being built into the laptop hardware itself would be a nice touch.

TLDR version: We‚Äôve recently noticed a regular exploiting our loyalty program to get a free drink ever few days and I‚Äôm wondering how to handle this. 


My shop has a loyalty program to where you buy 7 get the 8th free and while our coffee and food are a little expensive (7-10 for a latte üíÄ I don‚Äôt make the prices I just work here) it matches the area. And if people don‚Äôt like it there‚Äôs a Starbucks and dunkin right next to eachother no more than 3 minutes down the street. Despite the prices we still get every type of person but especially a lot of college students. Now I know being a college kid is hard and all and that our stuff is expensive but I‚Äôve noticed one girl who is an athlete at the nearest college handing in our loyalty card with everything checked off with the same lil symbol. The problem was they are all identical as if someone did them all at one time. But she only gave us this every week and a half and she comes almost everyday so I gave her the benefit of the doubt that she just forgets to ask us to check it off and does it herself. (A lot of my regulars don‚Äôt even use the card and because of that I just give them a free one once a week or so when I feel they would have filled up the card lol so I didn‚Äôt really mind.) But recently she has been doing this much more frequently. We have gotten 3 in the span of 6 days and I‚Äôm unsure of how to handle the situation. 

I worked at target as a cashier/customer service for a long ass time so I do know how to mitigate scammers but my managers were always there to help. My manager at this location is entirely hands off. We are our own bosses with the people being there more than a year or so basically being managers that the newer gals ask for help. 


I have 3 options for going about this, nice, intermediate, and hard ball.

Hard ball: I look at the ticket, look at her, look back at the ticket, look back at her and say ‚Äúdid you forge this?‚Äù If she‚Äôs nice and admits it I just tell her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do that again‚Äù and all is well. but if she says no of any kind I just show her the half dozen cards I‚Äôve saved up with dates on them that prove I‚Äôm correct and tell her to stop or she‚Äôs getting banned. Hell I could actually just ban her but idk I feel bad I get being a college student.

Intermediate: ‚Äúhey I see you here pretty often and each time you have one of these cards and I was just wondering how are you able to afford so much coffee?! I could have never as a student haha!‚Äù And she‚Äôll probably say something along the lines of ‚Äúhaha oh well you know, etc etc‚Äù I can then go to ‚ÄúIts just youve given me three cards this week , that‚Äôs 24 lattes! You might want to think about cutting your caffine back hahaha.‚Äù ‚Äúand it‚Äôs just really weird that all of the marks are the exact same you know?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs even weirder is that it dosent match any of the girls here check marks.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe WEIRDEST part is that you‚Äôve given me 3 of these now in the past week. So is this a misunderstanding or what? If not then your total is $9.14‚Äù I‚Äôd pause for interactions if she gave any. 

Nice: my bf who is an upper management of a different company told me to never start off by accusing anyone and allow them to redeem themselves. So I‚Äôll start off the same way with intermediate ‚Äúhey I see you here pretty often and each time you have one of these cards and I was just wondering how are you able to afford so much coffee! I could have never as a student haha!‚Äù  But just leave it at that and see if it stops.
