I used to have social anxiety so bad that I would literally avoid getting coffee from the coffee vendor at the grocery store just so I could avoid feeling   anxiety so intense that I almost passed out once and not once did she think to take me to a psychiatrist, she won‚Äôt even listen to me (or my brother) when either of us try to talk to her about basic health concerns and it quite literally took her until just recently to schedule a surgery to have my back molars removed when I have been complaining about severe pain for YEARS. She‚Äôs the same with my brother too, he had quite literally been complaining about severe pain in his foot every time he runs on flat surfaces (he runs track) for two months now and she finally scheduled him to go get X-rays at a hospital that specializes in X-rays and she did the same goddamn thing a few years when he had to get his appendix removed, for almost two weeks every fucking time he would complain about how much his stomach hurt she would just tell him that it‚Äôs just ‚Äúa stomach bug‚Äù even though he was puking a lot more than anyone would with a stomach bug and it took for him to start puking blood without being able to stop for her to finally take him to the hospital. I‚Äôm worried that something will be severely wrong with one of us one day and her not actually listening or thinking that we‚Äôre making it up will cause someone to die instead, plus I‚Äôm tired of her disregarding my health just because she doesn‚Äôt want to put in the effort to get me a diagnosis or take me to a doctor.",1,1734235725.0,Vent,0,0.99,False

1hekh10,https://v.redd.it/skv8str1sx6e1,First pourover. Need ffedback,"Need feedback on the overall procedure. Details here:

- V60: nestasia pourover, glass material
- Paper filter: bleached hario size 2
- Beans: light roast by fraction9
- Grinder: c2 at 18 clicks
- Total time: 3.5 minutes 
- Method: James Hoffman 

The coffee taste decent, a little underextracted maybe? I have had better taste when brewed using AP

Few observations:
- the first 50 ml drawdown was pretty quick. Not sure if blooming really happened. 
- I rinsed the filter before adding coffee however 30 seconds later and before I could add coffee, I noticed that the filter and the v60 wasn't hot enough and rather was at room temperature. 
- The paper filter in the V60 has a U-shaped fold, creating a gap between the filter and the inner wall. Adding photo in comment since can't add photo and video both. 

Need feedback on the overall procedure. Also do you think having the OG v60 would help? Got this one from nestasia on a sale. ",1,1734235378.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 30-year-old woman currently living in Connecticut on a 9-month fellowship. Education is a huge passion of mine, and I‚Äôm excited about the future as I explore this field.

A little about me: I‚Äôm around 5‚Äô4‚Äù with dark brown eyes and medium-length brown hair. I have a few tattoos, including a rose on my shoulder and a lilac on my forearm.

I lead a healthy lifestyle‚Äîno soda, smoking, or drugs‚Äîand I prefer moderate drinking (it‚Äôs just too expensive!). I‚Äôm more into quieter settings over big parties, and I‚Äôd rather enjoy coffee and cake than a night out at the bar. I‚Äôm an old soul who loves meaningful conversations and making the most of life‚Äôs little moments.

Politically moderate and non-religious, I believe in kindness, respect, and communication. I‚Äôm not married and don‚Äôt have children, but I‚Äôm open to the idea of building a family with the right person. When I‚Äôm not working, I love to write, draw, listen to synthwave music, and enjoy old-school films (I‚Äôm a big fan of *Gossip Girl*‚Äîthe 2007 original!).

Some of my favorite songs include *‚ÄúSunset‚Äù* by The Midnight and *‚ÄúSummer Eyes‚Äù* by Coastal. As for movies, I‚Äôm a fan of *Dogfight*, *Cruel Intentions*, *Stand By Me*, and *The Bling Ring* (2013). If you enjoy the same kind of music and films, we‚Äôll definitely have lots in common!

While I enjoy time on my own, I‚Äôm looking for someone special to share life with‚Äîa true partner who feels like a best friend. I want to share the small moments, laugh together, create inside jokes, and enjoy quiet, intimate moments. I believe relationships grow best when they‚Äôre built on a solid foundation of friendship, with romance and connection following naturally.

**About You:**

* **Age Range:** 28-37
* **Single and Stable**
* **Height:** 5'10"" or taller
* **Build:** Slim, fit, or lean
* **Gender:** Cisgender male (straight)
* **Child-free but open to kids**
* **Emotionally available**
* **Seeking:** A long-term, monogamous relationship with the potential for marriage
* **Past Relationships:** Ideally, no ongoing contact with exes. I believe in moving forward and leaving the past behind.
* **Lifestyle:** Non-smoker, drug-free, and moderate drinking is fine.
* **Location:** Ideally in Connecticut or within 25-35 miles (US/Canada preferred)
* **Communication:** Open to in-person meetings, video calls, phone calls, and texting (I love sharing ""Good morning"" and ""Goodnight"" messages!).

**What‚Äôs Important to Me:**

* **Consistency and Communication:** I value honesty and clarity. Actions speak louder than words, and I appreciate when someone shows they care by staying in touch and communicating openly.

If you‚Äôre kind, emotionally stable, and looking for a genuine connection, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Please include a photo with your message (and I‚Äôll gladly share mine if we connect). Let‚Äôs see if we can build something special together!",0,1734234952.0,r4r,1,0.5,False
1hekcox,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hekcox/am_i_the_asshole_for_not_knowing_why_my_roommates/,Am I The Asshole For Not Knowing Why My Roommates Were Upset With Me?,"This is a long one so bear with me. For context, this all happened 2021-2023. No real names are used. So when I was in college I had four roommates who we‚Äôll call Frank, Jack, David, and Mike. Frank and I were dorm mates in our first year of college (2021-2022) and quickly became great friends. What I didn‚Äôt know is Jack and Frank hooked up our first day of college, this will be important later. In March 2022 of our freshman year, Frank and I started a queer platonic relationship. If you don‚Äôt know what that is i‚Äôll put the description here: A queerplatonic relationship (QPR) is a close, non-romantic relationship that involves a deep level of emotional commitment. It's often described as a relationship that goes beyond what's considered a friendship, but is not strictly romantic. We even had a queer platonic wedding, which was officiated by Jack. Not long after that, David and Mike ended their QPR and Jack and Mike started a QPR together. (David had queer platonic feelings for Jack this whole time) Frank and I‚Äôs relationship went well for a while. Before our sophomore year (2022-2023), Frank, Jack, David, Mike and I all moved into a house together. A little less than a year into my QPR with Frank, he decided to admit that he and Jack had been in a sort of ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù since the first day of college. Around this time, Frank tried to start a QPR with David but they ultimately decided they were better off as just friends. Frank was still in a QPR with me. In October 2022, (we had moved into the house in August), Mike and Jack broke up and Mike was devastated. Jack and Frank were still together and Frank was in the QPR with me. Around this time, my mental health started to dramatically decline due to a plethora of reasons. I was struggling to find a job, struggling to pay rent, and I was very insecure in my relationship with my roommates. I also had romantic feelings for Frank. Frank went through a multitude of realizations and was also struggling mentally. I tried to help but he declined. One of these realizations was that he was polyamorous. On Halloween I drove everyone to a neighborhood an hour away so we could trick or treat. Once we got home, no one said thank you and they only pitched in gas money after Frank told them to in the house group chat. In November 2022 I started a job with fast food, and let me tell you, this was the worst job I have ever had. The staff was rude and negligent and verbally abused me quite often. At the same time, I started to believe that my roommates hated me. This is when Frank stepped up and held a house meeting to diffuse the tension in the house. He asked what was wrong and for everyone to air their grievances and we did. I expressed that I felt that everyone hated me and it was making it hard for me to want to continue living. Now, I don‚Äôt remember exactly what they said to me, but I remember it sounding, to me, along the lines of ‚Äúwe hate you and we don‚Äôt want you here‚Äù. The only person on my side during this was Frank. Until March 2023. About a week after our platonic wedding anniversary, he came into my room to talk to me. After a long time of telling me all the things I had done wrong, he finally said ‚Äúso yeah, I agree with everyone that you‚Äôre a terrible person and I think with who wants to live in the house next year, you shouldn‚Äôt‚Äù. I. Was. Crushed. In a single sentence I had lost my best friend, my partner, and my house. Now, for context, in December 2022, Frank developed a crush on the barista who worked at a coffee shop down the street from where we lived. He began to go to the coffee shop almost every single day in hopes of seeing this barista and hitting on them. This made me very upset and insecure which is my own fault I know. At the same time Frank decided he was not polyamorous and instead participated in relationship anarchy. In January 2023, Frank and Jack broke up and Frank was pissed. He vented to me often and told me he was upset that Jack wouldn‚Äôt give him space. In February 2023, everyone asked why I was upset with them and I had text most of them to explain myself and air my grievances. Except Mike, who I spoke to face to face and we resolved our issues and are still friends to this day. This was a week before my birthday. Their responses were essentially defending themselves and telling me I had no place being upset for the reasons I was. They still didn‚Äôt explain why the hated me. Despite this, they all attended my birthday party even though they hated me. I still to this day don‚Äôt know why they decided I was terrible. Now I don‚Äôt want to say that I am perfect and blameless in this. I‚Äôm not and I know I‚Äôm not. No one is blameless in this. My mom compares this whole situation to the song ‚ÄúLove Shack‚Äù by the B52s. I am still unsure what I did wrong. To wrap this up, I am no longer friends with any of these people except for Mike. All the relationships, queer platonic, romantic, whatever have ended and I have no contact with anyone but Mike.

We had an office-related party a few weeks ago and I ended up not sitting near him.

I didn't have that great of a party (other unrelated reasons), but I think some of it was also because I didn't get to sit near him.

I want to get out of my feelings for him. I don't want anything between us, just strictly being coworkers. We don't work directly together, but unfortunately I can't move out of the shared office.

How do I get away from my feelings? I usually sit near him for lunch, I go get coffee with him, we talk and bond over different stuff, but I want to withdraw completely.
The problem is that I love talking to him. He is such an interesting person, so I can't help but seek out conversations with him. But he is also sending such mixed signals. Some days he's all for talking, getting lunch and coffee together and other times he acts like I don't really exist in a way. I don't want to waste my time with these games, and unfortunately I think it's pretty obvious to him that I like him. 

What is the best way to do this? I've considered taking my lunch at a different time and even to just go get coffee without him, because I never so that. I've also considered to not start conversations at all, besides work stuff. 
But I just feel like it would be really noticeable.

First and foremost, I want to thank each and everyone of you who were kind enough to send me donations and encouraging messages. It means a lot to me and my pup. I will pray for all of you tonight before I go to bed.

2. I was not able to get any help from 211 last night. Ended up spending the night in my car at a rest stop. It was super cold, but at least there were no cops bothering me.

3. At around 11:00pm last night, I received a phone call from a respite center that they have an opening due to a cancelation. I had put my name on the waiting list previously, but was not sure how long it would take. Had my intake over the phone. The night was hopeful. Finally.

4. In the AM, stopped by 7-Eleven to get a cup of coffee, and headed to a park to walk my dog. It was brutally cold, but very refreshing knowing that I have a place to sleep tonight.

5. Stopped by ShopRite to pick up some bagel and cream cheese. shared it with my pup.

6. Drove down to Central Jersey where to respite center was. Checked in, another intake, and was assigned a room, and reviewed the house rules. 

7. Took a shower, pup was passed out in bed, and I took a long nap next to my dog. It was warm and cozy.

8. The respite center is equipped kitchen and pantry. Made myself garlic butter pasta shells with canned tuna. Felt so good to eat something homemade. I always wanted to attend culinary school. Just never got to it. There's a thought.

9. Took another nap. Guess I was super tired, and sleeping on a bed must've felt good and relaxing. Finally was able to stretch my legs and back.

10. Woke up about an hour ago,  had another bowl of leftover pasta, evening walk with my pup.

11. I can stay here for the next 10 days, which is great, but I would need to check out on Christmas day, 12/25.

I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, though it's still very far. There are still hurdles I need to hop over. Finding a permanent home, job, mental health, etc. Over the next 10 days, I'll be mostly focusing these issues. Hopefully Emergency Assistance kicks in during the time. It would be truly a Christmas Miracle. Respite center has daily therapy session, personal wellness session, and social workers who can assist me with resources, which is great. 

That's it for the day...

I thought I‚Äôd be relieved, but I‚Äôm devastated. A part of me cannot let go of this false hope of him I‚Äôve had the entire relationship. How do I learn to take off the rose colored glasses?","My boyfriend was a very low-effort partner. At first, it was OK with me. I had experienced a lot early in our relationship with a death in my family that required all of my focus. His little mishaps here and there and lack of prioritization didn‚Äôt bother me enough because I was so emotionally drained from the family stuff that I couldn‚Äôt deal with any negative relationship emotions.

 
However, as soon as it started to affect me and patterns repeated, I started to tell him how I was feeling. For example: 

1. He would not initiate plans & we would go weeks without seeing each other 
2. When he and I made a plan, he‚Äôd double book himself that day and save me for late at night when he got home. (A dinner and bar hop turned into just come over at 12am)
3. We didn‚Äôt spend quality time together: walks, coffee dates, exploring the city‚Ä¶ etc. if was just a nice date 1-2x a month if even. 
4. We‚Äôd go weeks without sleeping together. 
5. He wouldn‚Äôt include me in his plans, and I was often including him in mine (he wouldn‚Äôt come)
6. My friends started to notice how little we saw each other and that I was not happy. 
7. He refused to make plans with me. He said he ‚Äúnever knows how his week will look like.‚Äù Only wanted to last minute even though I told him I don‚Äôt appreciate super last minute plans. 
8. He‚Äôd go out every weekend with his friends to the bars. I‚Äôd never/ rarely be invited or included and questioning when I‚Äôd see him next. 

I vocalized to him that this isn‚Äôt the relationship I wanted to be in. I vocalized to him I need quality time and that his lack of effort feels like he‚Äôs not interested. 

In the beginning, he was super apologetic and understanding. For the first time, I felt comfortable being this vulnerable in a relationship. WOW. I can tell this man I‚Äôm upset about behaviors and he won‚Äôt run away. He‚Äôd tell me ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make time for us and plan something soon, how about this weekend?‚Äù Then, he‚Äôd plan a date and try to see me more regularly for the next 2-3 weeks, putting in more effort. He‚Äôd hold me close and ensure I feel secure. He‚Äôd say ‚ÄúI will do better.‚Äù But then after 2 weeks, it was back to the same BS. 


Some months I would only see him one or two times. We both live in the same city and have busy schedules, but I‚Äôve always set time for him and would make time. He rarely had time for me. I started to become super anxiously attached in the relationship. I was questioning if he was cheating, if he loved me or not, and even if he was an alcoholic since he was always out. I began going to peers for advice who told me to leave him. It frazzled me because I love this man. Even though he is so low effort sometimes, when I‚Äôm with him, it‚Äôs the best. He‚Äôs so sweet, so loving, and makes me feel like the most loved girl when I have him. But every time he ghosts our rare and few plans, every time he said he‚Äôd do better and didn‚Äôt, every time he cancelled on me- I started to question his love for me. 

I broke up with him because eventually I had enough. My friends were in my ear. I was becoming jealous of other peoples relationships where their partners put in equal effort and loved them. I didn‚Äôt feel loved, and for the first time he said:

Him: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you want me to tell you, I‚Äôm tired of going over this always. I do love you‚Äù 

Me: ‚Äúbut if you loved me you‚Äôd sleep with me, you‚Äôd desire me, you‚Äôd make plans with me.‚Äù

Him: ‚ÄúI love you but I don‚Äôt do plans.‚Äù 

Me: ‚Äúis something else going on with you?‚Äù

Him: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm depressed.‚Äù


And the cycle continues. I ask him why he hasn‚Äôt told me this sooner, as soon as I initiated conversation a while ago about feelings. I was constantly pushing to get this relationship right and ensure we were both doing good. I wanted to help him, but he didn‚Äôt allow me. He didn‚Äôt even want me. I removed the rose colored glasses from the false hope he provided, and am mourning the person I thought he was. ",2,1734234709.0,relationship_advice,4,0.75,False
1heka35,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1heka35/i_detest_cheap_entitled_people/,I detest cheap entitled people,"My family has lived in the same area for several generations.  My  grandparents were very well known among the people who live around here, as were the rest of the family. In the town, there is a pub.   It was expanded due to a fire many years ago.  The adjacent place decided to bail after the fire.  The pub owners brought out the adjacent space and expanded.  

To raise money for the rebuilding, people were allowed to be sponsors.  You would pay for a spot and your name would go on a plaque on the spot really just a metal tag with your name on it, screwed In a place you paid for.

For some, it was a 'one and done'.  Others continued to make payments, and some still do.

My family sponsored a table. My parents still pay the sponsorship. It's a table in the pub. It's been in the same (chosen) spot since my grandparents used to go to this place.  it's a table that really anyone can be seated at.  

So here's the  situation.  Every Saturday night, after service, my parents go to dinner at the pub. This place is a very popular place to go after services.  It packs out quickly.  If it's just them, they sit at the bar and hangout with the bartenders.  Everyone who works there knows them and talks to them. Unless they have others with them, they really don't sit at 'their table'. It's too big for just 2 people.  

Recently, the entire family was in town. The plan was to go to the pub for dinner.  Dad went to the pub around noon to tell them that we would be in for dinner around 6:00 after services, and we wanted to have our table. OK, it's reserved for 6:00, no problem.

So we go to service, we go to the pub. And....

There are people at our table.  Ok...I'm sure they'll be leaving soon, it's only 6:30. We'll just wait at the bar for a few minutes. We are told by one of the workers, that they had been at the table since 2:00 in the afternoon. They had had drinks, their meals, coffee, dessert. They had been given their check, and yet they sat. So we were waiting at the bar. 

This table was the only one that would have fit our group. So we waited.  As we waited,  we saw a group of 3 people walk in, walk past everyone at the bar (we weren't  the only ones waiting for a table), and they joined the group that had been sitting at the table. üò¶

The owner (who was at the bar), saw this happening, and they were told that they had to vacate the table, as it was reserved. It's now almost 7:45 at night.  We're at the bar drinking and snacking, but there's not enough room for all of us to eat a meal. Apparently, the 3 new comers were joining them for drinks. So they were told to move to the bar, which they did, under duress.  They were not happy about this, and were very vocal about the fact that they felt that they should be compensated for the inconvenience. The bartender poured them a complimentary round. The table was reset, and we went to our table.  

They left as we were finishing dinner and having dessert.  Our waiters told us that they had only tipped $7.00 for everything. We felt so bad for the staff being treated like that, that we all tipped an additional $10 each on top of our regular tip for dinner  

I hope they never go back.

Who does that crap?

My in laws can't calm her down, and she almost always cries if they are holding her or doing really anything with her without me holding her next to them. She doesn't do this for my parents, but she does for my in laws and most strangers. 

We tried spending more time with them but it didn't improve. Today we tried leaving her with them for 4 hours. I told them to call me if they couldn't calm her down. After we left, she cried for an hour and a half, eventually puked herself.  Then she napped, then woke up and cried again until I got there. When I got there she was on her tummy scream crying surrounded by shiny Christmas stuff in dirty puke stained clothes. She reeked and was overstimulated.(My fault for not leaving a backup clothes she rarely pukes but they should have at least undressed her and washed her off??) 

I'm upset they didn't call me. They are too busy trying to ""prove themselves"". They have raised four children so it's not like they are new to this. They are both nice people. I'm not worried about them trying CIO, being abusive or that she will end up on the hospital, she just cries with them. 

I just want to wait till she's older before letting them babysit for more than a quick coffee run. My husband is all up in arms about it saying it's unfair because we will leave her with my parents. 

What's the play here?

what if - Solo is putting on an act! He was never trapped in the silo. 

we see a flashback where Solo prepares for Juliets arrival and is watching her on his monitor. at this point we don't know where he is, so we naturally assume he's in 17. 

on the screen is a cryptic message - ""she is coming - brnrd s18""

When Bernard saw Juliet leaving and realized she has the good tape and will survive, he sends out the sos. 

then the screen pans around to show that actually Solo is in yet another silo, as the door opens and we see and hear noise of other people.

Solo is tasked with going to silo 17 (via the interconnecting pipes) and act like he's been there and find out everything he can from her, to manipulate and sabotage her if needed. of course he knows the whole history of 17.

final scene - we see a bunch of people having a meeting talking about silo matters. Immediately we know this is a huge deal. Bernard is there, but we hear a familiar voice and its Solo. It turns out this is the weekly meeting of the IT directors of the Silo HoA !!

the episode ends with them concluding the meeting, finishing the donuts and coffee, and they open the door - to blinding sunlight and a garden path with mountains in the distance. as they walk out, laughing and joking, we see around the corner the familiar circles of the silos. and we realize nothing is as it seems....",0,1734234308.0,SiloSeries,2,0.5,False

[I dare you to eat just one.](https://preview.redd.it/vsxfpdzgrw6e1.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=b969f3271579b6c439167bb4f490ffe7d6bc263d)

Well[!](https://imgur.com/a/Ko1jjo5) It's been a while since we've covered a dish you can make at home in our sunrise series - but over the next days we're going to be covering quite a few.  That's because the holiday season in Ukraine is decidedly foodie!

Here's a treat we discovered recently that we've really enjoyed cooking: It's called Banyk, and it hails from the Zakarpattia region in western Ukraine.

[Ready to roll.](https://preview.redd.it/5cuirmzoix6e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=396be867cfb15abc244a7e6b9d9d760efd52a9a7)

**Banyk** shares many similarities with another recipe that we highly recommend called **Makivnyk** that we wrote about all the way back on Day 213 (find that recipe [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/xncn7u/648_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_213th_day_of/)) - enough so that I suspect it's the same dish; I might upset someone by that statement though :)  Today's recipe contains a delicious walnut filling rather than poppy seeds and is an impressive treat to your holiday party guests (or just for eating by yourself while binging a tv show).  If you want extra points, you could cook half with walnuts and half with poppies.

I've included some of Chef Klopotenko's notes, as there are some intricacies despite its simple appearance.

We hope you go nuts for Banyk!  Make sure to share with the r/Ukraine community if you give it a shot!

# How to Make Banyk, from Chef Klopotenko

[Banyk](https://preview.redd.it/xohfmmdl8x6e1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=6907e80578f261ece43ecb198e08c9eb84159476)

**Ingredients**

* 10 grams of fresh yeast
* 1 tablespoon Sugar
* 125 ml of milk
* 250 grams of flour
* 1 egg yolk
* 1/3 of teaspoon of salt
* 1 table spoon of oil
* 1 egg for glazing

**Recipe**

**Step 1:** In a bowl, mix 10g of fresh yeast, rubbing it between your hands, 125ml of warm milk and 1 tbsp of sugar. Leave to rise for 10 minutes.

Note: *To activate it, you will need warm milk with a temperature of about 36 degrees. You can check it with a thermometer or by dropping it on the back of your hand: it should feel warm, but not hot. In colder milk, the yeast will not activate, and in hot milk it will die. Also, do not forget that yeast dough does not like drafts and is best suited in a warm room.*

**Step 2:** Mix 250 g of sifted flour, 1 egg yolk, ‚Öì tsp. salt and 1 tbsp. oil. Add this mixture to the dough and knead until smooth. If necessary, add a little flour, up to 30 g, to make it easier to knead.

**Step 3:** Form the dough into a ball, place in a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise for 50 minutes.

**Step 4:** Heat 70 ml of apple juice until hot. For the filling, blend 500 g of walnuts in a blender until crumbly. Mix them with 2 tbsp. sugar and the hot apple juice.

[Step 4](https://preview.redd.it/y68mwhf3ix6e1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e9e07346d8163ca7fd0218e54000e9eb4095dcf)

**Step 5:** Turn on the oven and preheat to 180 degrees. Knead down the dough, sprinkle flour over your work surface and roll it into a rectangular layer 0.5-0.7 cm thick.

[Step 5](https://preview.redd.it/61cgb3i1ix6e1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa3341bcbbcc8d33e057fa36afaa89fe2034a214)

**Step 6:** Sprinkle the dough with the filling, spreading it over the entire surface, but leaving 3-4 cm from the edges.

**Step 7:** Fold the sides inward and roll it into a roll. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the roll on it, seam side down.

[Step 7](https://preview.redd.it/9cth6085ix6e1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=82f43f501d82386a809f6ab4df06e147d69dc336)

**Step 8:** Beat 1 egg and brush the roll with it using a silicone brush.  Bake the loaf for 30 minutes.

**Step 9:** Cut and serve the roll when it has cooled.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I‚Äôm a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I‚Äôve mentioned in my post, it‚Äôs up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on ‚Äúhey‚Äù or smalltalk responses.

Blake's mind is under the control of something. Despite knowing this, Vila believes everything that Blake says to him. This is not a good Vila episode, since Blake easily manipulates him to lock the other crew members up. I mean we get it... Vila is a coward and a thief and that's his personality. But he is just too gullible here. Meanwhile the Liberator is changing course every few minutes between Del-10 and the mining asteroid PK-118.

Ven Glynd tries to convince Avon that presenting clear evidence in a courtroom, in a rational and logical manner, will actually change things for the better in the Federation.

This scene is a huge highlight. Whoever wrote this scene should get a medal. And yes I am serious. As the 3 rebels enter the auditorium to present their case against the Federation, they see that it is completely empty. Federation goons turn up behind them and then Servalan appears on the screen to tell them to surrender. They freakin' took film footage of Servalan's lines and projected them onto the screen in the auditorium. Absolutely brilliant concept. Not enough to save the episode, but it is pretty impressive.

I'm hoping these tips will work for some of you too ü§û

1. First, pray for a seamless review period.
2. Print the syllabus and make notes doon mismo sa bar syllabus per topic. For me, it worked as a compact reviewer for every bar exam day kasi maliit lang yung space for taking notes so you're limited to write only those na you deem very important to remember. Ito lang yung binabasa ko before we're asked to put our bags and reviewers outside the exam room. The pros in doing this, for me, is I can read the notes na important and I can also review the topics included in the bar syllabus kasi if you can't come up with an answer real quick just remember the topics includer in the syllabus and start from there.
3. Choose your review materials start pa lang ng review period and stick to it. Before ako nagstart magreview I decided to enroll in JBRC and stick to their review materials as in ito lang talaga. The reviewers were given in advance before the lectures so I would read them first and then watch the lectures so I can just listen na lang and at the same time recall what I read. The roster of lecturers sa Jurists talaga grabe, thank you to all of the professors there, you saved me (this is not an advertisement just appreciation po) üíñ
4. Bar Q and As, I wasn't consistent with this but reading it helped me in practicing how to answer bar questions. If you have time, please also consider reading and answering 3 bar questions a day.
5. Lastly, if you're feeling overwhelmed sometimes, take a break. Don't time your breaks para hindi ka ma pressure pati sa break time mo, yung enough lang to clear your mind and it can be any activity like, playing mobile games, walking, going out for coffee, then go back to studying.

I will add more items if I can remember more, but ito na lang muna for now. You can also ask questions and I will answer as much as I can. Congratulations to all of us 2024 bar passers and good luck and God bless to all future lawyers! üíñ",15,1734232754.0,LawStudentsPH,1,0.94,False

they left their mothers home and went off, venturing in the world.

whilst on the road they came to a conclusion during one of their last conversations together

the elder pig was called Gordon, the middle pig was called Patrick and the youngest was called Thomas.

Gordon, being the eldest decided to speak first because he had something to say which he deemed of great importance that the rest should listen to.

""uhm... Thomas, Patrick, we have come to a crossroad in life. we have left our dear mother and now we venture alone in the world. therefore I believe we should stick together and I will lead all of us to safety""

the others all looked at him with confusion. they felt that they had independence now and could venture on alone.

Patrick spoke ""I want to be alone"" he said.

Thomas tutted and looked up at the sky with tears in his eyes ""our dear mother... would have liked us to be together... but fate would have it different for us. I'm going off alone brother... "" he said whilst patting his brothers Gordon and Patrick on the shoulder.

Gordon knew their was no arguing with Thomas. Patrick on the other hand was insecure and could easily be persuaded to join him due to his deep vulnerabilities and child like behaviour .

in all truth it was decided after a while that the three brothers would split and go their own ways.

they said their goodbyes in a pub in a small village by the forest edge.

Gordon was rather annoyed at being alone. in his own way he wished to use the labour of his other brothers so that he could take it easy on the road.

whilst walking away, he decided that the first thing he should do is  find somewhere to stay. Indeed they had been camping whilst traveling and it was Thomas who was better at putting up a tent and such things. Gordon had only done everything himself because he didn't want his other brothers to think he was not a leader. However now that he was alone the pressure to please did not weigh on him. the only thing that weighed on him was to please his own ego.

he bought straw to build a house because he thought that was the easiest and best thing to do.

the house was called ""stehender K√§fig""

Patrick on the other hand was finding it exciting. he had never been alone before and always wished this day would come. it finally had and now he could do things his way... alone.

he bought a chain saw and began chopping wood. like his father, he decided to build a house of twigs. he had seen his father make a wooden house before, and therefore this was the only tool he knew how to use.

the house was called ""Herr der Fliegen"".

winter was near approaching, Thomas found the road bitter and cold. he sighed and his breath turned to smoke. the pale green pastures and the fog in the distance made for a postcard scene.

in the distance he saw a young female pig, reading a book.

""good day"" he said to her whilst removing his cap.

she didn't answer and instead just smiled and nodded.

they were married two months later and Thomas built a thatched cottage and he named it ""Buch der Weisheit""

\~

winter hugged the dark and icy days. turning the streams to ice and the forest to glitter.

the fields sparkled in the red sun and the animals slept in their cosy burrows.

the animals who didn't hibernate prepared for the feast of Yule.

one day Thomas's wife came running into the living room.

""what is it my dear?"" Thomas replied with warm and twinkling eyes.

""the paper"" she handed him the paper. he took this and his eyes widened in concern.

wolves were known to creep about the forest in winter and it seemed one had been sighted alone in the outskirts of the county.

apparently his name was Donald and he was a known sales man who also was infamously associated with the German mafia. he had also managed to kidnap a girl with a red hood.

although Thomas was calm about this because he knew exactly how to protect his wife and farm from danger, he was rather concerned how his brothers were doing. He had not had any contact from them in weeks. neither had his mother heard from her two sons, although she kept regular contact with Thomas via telegraph.

so how were Gordon and Patrick faring after all this time?

well, Gordon was know living in a 7 bedroom dorm, due to the fact that his own home was too cold to live in and he frequently caught colds and bronchitis due to lack of hot food.

he was paying for the place with his meagre salary from working in the same pub which he left 3 months ago with his two brothers.

\~

Patrick on the other hand was not heard of. he own home remained empty and the signs of him were really untraceable.

\~

Thomas knew some of these details from asking around the area. so he was rather worried if they should fall into wrong company, assuming they had not already.

he sighed and looked out the window as the snow softly fell outside. his wife poured some coffee and sat by his side. she opened a book and began reading.

Let's face it, morning breath is a universal experience, a shared human quirk we all secretly dread. And for many of us, coffee is the sacred elixir that helps us conquer the morning grogginess. But a nagging question often brews in the back of our minds: does that delicious cup of joe contribute to less-than-fresh breath? The relationship between coffee and bad breath is more nuanced than you might think. It's a complex interplay of factors, from the coffee beans themselves to the way our bodies react to that caffeine kick. So, grab your favorite mug, settle in, and let‚Äôs dive into the fascinating world of coffee breath, exploring the science, the solutions, and everything in between.

Does Coffee Give Bad Breath? Unveiling the Aromatic Enigma
----------------------------------------------------------

Coffee, that ubiquitous beverage, is a complex concoction of chemical compounds. Its rich aroma and invigorating effects are a testament to this complexity. But this same complexity can also contribute to that dreaded coffee breath. Ironically, the very things we love about coffee ‚Äì its robust flavor and stimulating properties ‚Äì can sometimes leave us with less-than-desirable breath.

### The Science Behind Coffee Breath

So, how does this happen? Several factors are at play:

1. **Dry Mouth:** Coffee, like many caffeinated beverages, is a diuretic. This means it encourages fluid loss, potentially leading to a dry mouth. Saliva plays a vital role in washing away bacteria and food particles, so a decrease in saliva production creates a breeding ground for odor-causing bacteria. Think of your mouth as a garden ‚Äì saliva is the sprinkler system keeping things fresh. Without it, things can get a bit‚Ä¶ripe.
2. **Sulfur Compounds:** Coffee beans contain sulfur compounds, released during the roasting process. These sulfurous notes contribute to coffee‚Äôs characteristic aroma, but they can also linger in the mouth, leading to a less-than-pleasant smell. It‚Äôs a bit of a double-edged sword ‚Äì the very compounds that make coffee so enticing can also contribute to its breath-altering effects.
3. **Coffee‚Äôs Acidity:** Coffee is naturally acidic. This acidity can disrupt the delicate pH balance in our mouths, creating an environment more conducive to bacterial growth. Imagine adding vinegar to a petri dish ‚Äì the same principle applies in our mouths. The acidic environment promotes the growth of bacteria, which in turn contribute to bad breath.
4. **Milk and Sugar: The Accomplices:** Adding milk and sugar to your coffee can exacerbate the issue. Sugar provides a feast for bacteria, accelerating their growth and odor production. Think of sugar as fertilizer for the bacteria in your mouth. Milk, while not as directly impactful, can also contribute to the problem by coating the tongue and providing another surface for bacteria to cling to.

### Recognizing the Culprits: Coffee and Halitosis

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

Beyond the general factors contributing to coffee breath, certain types of coffee and brewing methods can be more problematic than others. Darker roasts, with their higher concentration of sulfur compounds, often lead to more pronounced coffee breath. Similarly, brewing methods that involve longer steeping times, such as French press, can extract more of these sulfurous notes. It's like leaving tea to steep for too long ‚Äì the flavor becomes more intense, but so does the potential for a lingering aftertaste.

Does Coffee Give Bad Breath? Debunking the Myths and Exploring the Solutions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the connection between coffee and bad breath is undeniable, it's not an insurmountable problem. Many simple strategies can help keep your breath fresh, even after your morning cup.

### Combating Coffee Breath: Practical Tips and Tricks

- **Hydration is Key:** Drinking plenty of water throughout the day is essential. Water helps to wash away lingering coffee residue and combat the dehydrating effects of caffeine. Think of it as rinsing your coffee cup ‚Äì you need water to clear out the remnants.
- **Chew Sugar-Free Gum:** Chewing sugar-free gum stimulates saliva production, helping to neutralize odors and cleanse the mouth. Look for gum containing xylitol, a natural sweetener that has been shown to inhibit bacterial growth.
- **Brush and Floss Regularly:** This one seems obvious, but it‚Äôs crucial. Brushing and flossing remove food particles and plaque, which can contribute to bad breath. It‚Äôs like cleaning your coffee maker ‚Äì regular maintenance prevents buildup and keeps things running smoothly.
- **Tongue Scraping:** The tongue can harbor a significant amount of bacteria. Using a tongue scraper can help remove this bacterial buildup, leaving your breath fresher.
- **Mouthwash:** An antimicrobial mouthwash can help kill odor-causing bacteria. However, choose an alcohol-free variety, as alcohol can dry out the mouth, exacerbating the problem.
- **Consider Your Coffee Choices:** If coffee breath is a persistent issue, you might consider switching to lighter roasts or different brewing methods. Experimenting with different types of coffee can help you find one that‚Äôs both delicious and less likely to cause bad breath.

### Beyond the Basics: Addressing Underlying Issues

Sometimes, persistent bad breath can be a sign of an underlying health issue. If you‚Äôre concerned about chronic bad breath, regardless of your coffee consumption, it‚Äôs always a good idea to consult with a dentist or doctor. They can help identify any potential underlying causes and recommend appropriate treatment. Don't brush it off ‚Äì your breath could be trying to tell you something!

Does Coffee Give Bad Breath? The Verdict and Final Thoughts
-----------------------------------------------------------

So, does coffee give bad breath? The short answer is: it can. But it doesn‚Äôt have to. While coffee can contribute to bad breath due to its dehydrating effects, acidity, and sulfur compounds, there are plenty of ways to mitigate the problem. By staying hydrated, practicing good oral hygiene, and being mindful of your coffee choices, you can enjoy your daily dose of caffeine without sacrificing fresh breath. It's all about finding the right balance.

Ultimately, the key to enjoying coffee without the breath-related baggage lies in understanding the science behind the issue and taking proactive steps to address it. Coffee, like many of life‚Äôs pleasures, is best enjoyed in moderation and with a little bit of know-how.

At first I thought it was related to stress/anxiety since I was going through some pretty big life events (moving, final assignments were due for uni). By the end of the week I had some fun events and it should have all been great and a stress-reliever, but my incapability to breathe got worse and it has singlehandedly ruined my life.

I've had two episodes now where I would be outside and suddenly the inside of my mouth is heavily dry, I'm experiencing air hunger, can't swallow or breathe, my hands and legs get all shaky, and I literally cannot breathe unless I have some water. It's awful. 

I went to my family physician a few days ago and he said I most likely have silent reflux, and prescribed me esomeprazole. The days leading up to the appointment, I actually was doing better and was able to go outside and do normal things. I was eating food and drinking coffee and felt fine, that out of breath sensation was mostly gone, only at night before I slept, but my sleep has been fine (its the only thing that has been consistent this entire time). But the second I started taking esomeprazole, it came back. Yesterday I was at the cinema and had to literally stand up multiple times because my hands and legs were shaking and numb (probably from lack of oxygen/poor blood circulation), and today I have not been able to eat all day. Mind you, I went to the cinema a week ago and I was fine (and I was experiencing bad breathing/throat tightness the day before). Today I took esomeprazole in the AM but it has just made me lose my appetite, worsened my symptoms, gave me headaches, etc so I've been sleeping/lying down all day. Tonight I was quite hungry though so I tried to slowly eat, but it came to a point where I felt my throat closing and almost choked and my heart was racing so I had to stop. 

My shoulders are quite tight (they already get tense easily on its own), I'm hungry but I can't eat and the internet is telling me to eat only certain things, and I just feel so lost and alone. I made another appointment with my physician because he told me to see him again if the medicine doesn't work, and he would look into getting an h.pylori test and/or endoscopy, but he warned me that the wait time could be long. 

I'm honestly scared that one of these days I'm going to d word in my sleep because of how bad I can't breathe and it's causing unnecessary stress onto me, when I have nothing else to stress about in my real life. I'm a healthy 21F who has had digestion/bloating issues in the past but I started taking enzymes and I still do and they helped me get rid of that issue. I'm wondering whether the trigger for this was actually a few days before the symptoms really started kicking in, I ate this extremely spicy sandwich with jalapeno and the entire skin on my lip and under my nose went numb in pain (it went away in like an hour but it was quite terrible). That has never happened to me before, but I'm wondering whether that messed something up. But right now my priority is to get back to a somewhat state of normal where I can eat without choking, or go days without eating. ",4,1734231600.0,GERD,3,1.0,False

Today she was drinking out of it and it started sparking, she threw it on the ground and it exploded with the force of a mortar shell firework and stared on fire. It literally knocked her off her feet. We were vending at a busy christmas market inside a tent, so I grabbed it and ran it outside and threw it in the snow and used a fire extinguisher to put it out, but the lithium battery kept re-igniting until it burned itself out. Thankfully she wasn't hurt physically due to her quick instincts, but emotionally terrified. She actually forgot it at home this morning and we went back home to get it, luckily, as this would have started a fire in our house for sure. 
She is of the opinion that we need to let the company know asap so they are aware of the problem, which I don't disagree with, but I also feel we are deserving of some compensation as well. I was a volunteer firefighter and due to my quick actions I probably saved the entire 120 foot long tent with a thousand people in it from catching fire at my own personal risk as well.

1hej5q7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1hej5q7/what_am_i_doing_wrong/,What am I doing wrong? ,"I am a 37-year-old woman who has tried numerous dating apps, including paid versions, without any luck. When someone does happen to match with me or respond, they quickly friend-zone me. This has happened with three different people already.

Out of curiosity, I decided to filter exclusively for men instead of women, just to test the functionality of the app. My inbox was flooded with messages the very next day. Now, I am unsure what I am doing wrong in attracting women.

I am not sure why people insist on friend-zoning me before even giving me a chance.

The first woman I went out with invited me to see a movie and have a few drinks. Even before we met, she stated that she was only interested in friendship at the moment. A few days later, I learned she was dating someone else during the same period that we were spending time together.

The second woman, whom I met at my apartment complex, expressed a similar sentiment. She claimed she was in a poor emotional state and had no intention of dating anyone. A few days later, I discovered that she was active on the same dating app as I was on.

The third individual I encountered was much the same. She invited me for coffee, despite living about two hours away. When I attempted to get to know her through text  before meeting, she suddenly declared that she was merely looking for friendship. This came as a surprise, given that her profile clearly stated she was seeking a long-term relationship.

And these are just a few examples. I am not someone who will put myself out there like this, it took me a year to muster the courage to even post this on reddit, and it‚Äôs disheartening that, after all that effort, people show little to no interest. Their quick move to friendship instead of romance truly stings. I am not opposed to beginning as friends while we get to know each other, but it does not seem that any of them share this intention.

I have a stable, full-time job and am currently pursuing further education. While I wouldn‚Äôt call myself the most attractive woman in the world, but I am a decent person who treats others with respect and kindness. I don‚Äôt go out much nor do I drink often; I primarily focus on work, schoolwork, and my love of reading / audiobooks. 

I apologize if this seems like an excessive amount of venting, but after more than a year of these experiences, I don‚Äôt know what else to do. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated.

But, I can‚Äôt help but keep thinking about how he treated me in the first year of our relationship.. with little improvement in the following years. 

We accidentally got pregnant 5 months into our relationship, and I was really scared. We were both in our final year of medical/dental school. He immediately told me to get an abortion without further discussion, and me being scared, I thought that was the best way forward too. I decided to go interstate to my second home to get it done because I wanted to be away from family. On the day I was supposed to fly, I cleaned his place while he was at lectures, and we were supposed to have about 1.5hours to have a quick last lunch together before he took me to the airport. He decided to go do his weekly grocery run on his way home, and we ended up having only 40 minutes left to spend together. I got upset, and he said I don‚Äôt understand how busy he is (he later admitted he could have found other time). He gave me the silent treatment in the 4 days prior to my abortion. I went alone, paid for it alone, but we got back in contact on the day of the abortion and he stayed on the phone with me while I was miscarrying and screaming in pain (to this day it is the worst pain I‚Äôve ever imagined, 60mg of codeine and I was constantly on the verge of blacking out from pain). He then asked if it was cool that he went out with friends for dinner while I was still in pain. For our 6 month anniversary, we decided to do couples rings, to solidify our relationship and signify commitment, especially after what we went through. When I asked him what budget we should set, he said ‚Äú1k‚Äù. I said okay. I got him a solid gold band of about 1k value, to be fair to him, even though women‚Äôs rings are typically more expensive. When time came on our 6m anniversary, there were no flowers, no restaurant booking, no acknowledgement and no ring. He had bought a fake ring off a Chinese ‚Äútemu like‚Äù website, and it hadn‚Äôt arrived yet. I gave him his ring, but mid day, I broke down and asked him why he didn‚Äôt buy a ring to exchange on our 6 month anniversary, especially for what it symbolizes after what we went through. He said it isn‚Äôt his fault it hasn‚Äôt arrived yet. I told him even if it‚Äôs a cheap silver band from Michael hill I would be happy, at just something to exchange on our 6 month anniversary as we had previously discussed. I asked him why he chose such a dodgy website, but also why did he purchase a ring worth about $10 when he was the one that set a 1k budget. He said he couldn‚Äôt meet the 1k budget. I asked him why he set that so high then, knowing I wasn‚Äôt working at the time, I had to dip into my savings too to make that, but I thought it was quite an important step in our relationship so I did it. He said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what my ex would have wanted‚Äù. And I said ‚Äúif that‚Äôs what your ex deserved then what does it say about what I deserve if you go and get a ring like that‚Äù. We then moved past it (if I hadn‚Äôt gotten pregnant, I know I wouldn‚Äôt have stayed in that relationship and disrespect, but as a girl from a conservative family, I was so scared). 

For my birthday 2 months later, he got me a cheap jewellery box from the dollar mart. I don‚Äôt even wear that much jewellery, apart from a pair of everyday diamond earrings and a necklace, which I keep in their original Tiffany boxes. He had asked me if I wanted a jewellery box, I said no, he got me one anyway. That‚Äôs what sucked. He said he thought I said no to be polite. I told him that the close proximity of the abortion, ring situation and my birthday (the lack of effort, no dinner or cake) made me feel absolutely worthless. He said wait for Valentine‚Äôs Day, I‚Äôll make it up to you big time. 
Two weeks later, it was Valentine‚Äôs Day, and he said to stay home all day to wait for my flower delivery. I waited and waited, and at 6pm a small bunch of dead spray roses came. I was floored. They were actually wilted. I sent him a photo and said he should ask for a refund. He‚Äôs not very proactive so I called the florist myself to ask what this is about. The florist, who turned out to be a cemetery florist, said, no offence but you got the cheapest bunch from the cheapest florist in the state, on Valentine‚Äôs Day, what did you expect. He refunded me, but politely said I feel sorry for you. 
My partner then told his friends I was selfish and materialistic and that I expected too much for Valentine‚Äôs Day, although he was the one that told me to wait for Valentine‚Äôs Day because he was going to make it up to me big time. 
Then came along out 1 year anniversary, which he said he was going to make up for me. He took me to a nice hotel for the night, but I could see on his booking.com account, which he gave me, to book hotels for an upcoming overseas trip, that he had booked the penthouse suite for his ex girlfriend, rooftop bar access (exclusive) and breakfast in bed. My partner tried to haggle with front desk to ask for free rooftop bar access, and was asked to pay the access fee, he said nah not worth it. He initially hyped up watching the sunset from the rooftop bar, as one of the highest in the city with floor to ceiling glass, but when he couldn‚Äôt haggle his way in, he was like nah and ended up napping by himself through sunset. Also, on the lead up to our anniversary, he had asked me multiple times to send him a link to a designer bag I wanted. I‚Äôm in no way a materialistic person, I don‚Äôt have any designer bags, but he insisted, so I linked him to a lower end 1.2k bag. I had the expectation that I was receiving that bag, so I bought him a nice leather work bag, almost 1k. I also made him a handmade gift and a card. When we exchanged gifts, he gave me a cheap silver necklace worth about $30. I was disappointed because he had continuously said explicitly, multiple times he was getting me a bag. We went to dinner, which I planned, then when the bill came, he asked to split the bill. 
We walked the 20 minutes to the restaurant me in heels because he didn‚Äôt want to pay for the Uber to save money. On the way, he said I looked really sad. I tried to smile and not ruin our day and said I‚Äôm not. Even when receiving the necklace, I excitedly put it on and said thank you, even though it was not what I was expecting nor was it my style at all. 
He said we can watch the sun rise, because we didn‚Äôt get to see sunset. When I tried to wake him the following morning, he didn‚Äôt want to. I went to ask the hotel staff if I could go watch the sunrise on a veranda somewhere, and they said sorry that wasn‚Äôt available for low level rooms (which I had). I got myself a coffee and sat next to the small window in our bathroom and watched the sunrise by myself and cried hard. The next morning we went to a cafe for breakfast on the way home and split the bill again. 

I feel like if he had just taken me to a different hotel, or at least given me the same experience he gave her, I wouldn‚Äôt have minded. Given the comparison with the ring situation, and Valentine‚Äôs Day, my birthday, given he‚Äôs told me he‚Äôs given her expensive gifts like a Dyson etc, yet cheaps out on me, I felt absolutely worthless. 

When I raised my concerns a few days later, that I felt hurt by the 50-50 when he use to be so generous with others, and the hotel booking, when I could see he went all out with another partner (which he was aware I could see), he said ‚Äúfine, we‚Äôre never doing a hotel getaway ever again‚Äù and we still haven‚Äôt to this day.

For our second anniversary, he had promised he would get me a designer bag this time, and he got me to send him a google doc with a link with a few options. I got him a new phone and some other heartfelt things, but he said he was going to get the bag ‚Äúlater‚Äù closer to when we go overseas, so that we can get the tax refund. 
With 5 days before going overseas, I half teased him, while we were lying in bed, if I was still getting the bag. He said ‚Äúoh you still want it?‚Äù (By the way, leading up to this, I had given him a 30k loan to buy a house, stupid of me I know, and he kept saying if his stocks hit a certain amount he would get me the bag (it did), he said repeatedly again that he would get me the bag, again). 
I was heartbroken yet again but just told him I‚Äôm headed to the city and will pick up the bag he promised and used his card. 

I feel like I find myself reflecting on our relationship a lot, and I find it especially hurtful when I think about these incidences. I find it hard to not feel sad, even though it‚Äôs been a while. 

On the outside we are both highly successful people, and everyone says we are a power couple. I want to know, would you be able to forgive and move on from what has happened? I find myself thinking about how I was treated a lot. Things have slightly improved, but like he said, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not that type of person anymore where he would spend all his money on his partner‚Äù this isn‚Äôt what I was expecting but I just want to feel worth it and loved. 

Am I over reacting by thinking about the past? He now shouts me a meal for my birthday and for our second anniversary. Is this something you can move on from? Please be honest with me. ",1,1734230592.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1hej4aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/1hej4aa/siren_thesis_part_20_at_the_iron_blood_dorm/,Siren Thesis. Part 20- At the Iron Blood dorm,"Part of a few short stories, with the intentional purpose of exploring a group of ""branches"", or ""test sites"", that have developed a new branch of Azur Lane dedicated to fight landbased Siren forces.

Summary:

Buggy and Stormcat make their way around Azur Lane after being dismissed from the testing site, a less than gentle nudge for them to go and be part of whatever activity they want to undertake, that is not technically work-related. And Stormcat has a certain place she has set herself to go visit for her own unconventional reasons.

[Previous part](https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/1h9bari/siren_thesis_part_192_the_debriefing/)

////

It was an almost idyllic midday within the port, a blue sky, cool winds gently blowing, bringing the calming scent of the sea as well a refreshing sensation even with the midfall‚Äôs sun on one's back.

In the middle of such blissful weather, Buggy and Stormcat were walking at a calm pace through the port of Azur Lane. Both feeling like they had achieved a great deal of things, regardless of being technically on a forced vacation, imposed on them by the commander of Azur Lane. But alas, more than once they had a discussion or two about the subject, all Valkyries agreed that they felt somewhat restless if they were not moving or doing something.

Even now, during their small vacation, they found enjoyment in participating in whatever activity took place within Azur Lane. Fortunately for them, many of the Kansen also preferred to be active as well as creating some sort of event.

After lending a hand on the second day of tests performed with the Siren walker, brought by Doctor Bethencourt, they had been graciously kicked off the test site by some of the girls. Insisting that they shouldn‚Äôt spend their free time on the test grounds, since it was technically work-related, and encouraging them to find something else to do, preferably something that didn‚Äôt require a report at the end of the activity.

When it came to actually do something they wished to do for themselves, it was Stormcat that had something in mind that she wanted to do, or rather, something they could do only now that they were at the main base of Azur Lane.

¬†

‚ÄúYou really memorized the whole place already, uh?‚Äù Buggy asked, finally breaking the silence that had settled once they made their way out of the test site.

‚ÄúWell, we had plenty of opportunities, on the first day they gave us a brief tour.‚Äù Stormcat replied ‚ÄúPlus, this morning Coby convinced me to accompany her on a morning jog alongside Tennessee and some other girls keen on taking advantage of every second of daylight.‚Äù

‚Äúah‚Ä¶ how was that like?‚Äù Buggy asked somewhat gingerly about it.

While they preferred to be on the move or doing something, there was always individual characteristics and peculiarities to the Valkyries. And in Buggy‚Äôs case while she was quite reliable and serious, she tried her best to take to heart the idea of this being a break of sorts. As such, she certainly did not spend her first morning in Azur Lane waking up her teammates at dawn break in order to go for a jog around the island. Plus, from the sounds being made early morning on their accommodations, as well as the current conversation, someone else took it into their hands that her team had some morning exercises.

‚ÄúEh, it is a nice enough place. It‚Äôs the people that make it shine, really. Some of these girls are quite cheerful and accommodating.‚Äù Stormcat shrugged her shoulders at that statement.

‚ÄúThe arrangement of the base is kinda hectic. We made our way to pick up some more people from each dorm to join the jog around the base. It‚Äôs a pretty common thing for them, apparently. That‚Äôs why I know where to go now.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd where is that? You kind of just started walking without saying where you intended to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I didn‚Äôt tell you?‚Äù Stormcat giggled at that.

‚ÄúE-yup, sure haven‚Äôt‚Äù

‚ÄúI see, my bad, sorry.‚Äù

""You still haven‚Äôt answered my question"" Buggy insisted in a semi-playful tone.

""Fine, if you want to be so insistent about it."" Stormcat replied while raising her hands in a defeated gesture.

And regardless of such a statement, Stormcat simply remained quiet for the next few minutes. Buggy could only sigh internally, as well as quite openly about it. Her companion was wont to have bouts of whimsical behavior, and she knew by vast amounts of unfortunate experience that once Stormcat got into such a mood, it was simply better to not pursue any further, especially if one didn't feel like engaging in some kind of tomfoolery.

And they were technically in vacation time, as such she simply allowed the lull of the conversation to turn into a pleasant sort of quiet moment where she didn't have to get straight answers out of her team.

It was after several minutes of walking through the well paved roads of Azur Lane that they reached one of the various Kansen dorms. Buggy was surprised by the sight of it, she more or less expected something militaristic in nature, but in reality it had the profile of a common modern building. It certainly didn't look the part of a modern corporate building, but it still held a certain degree of that ominous feel from such a place.

Thinking about it she realized that she didn't know enough architecture to be able to formulate an opinion about the minute details of modern architecture. To her it was a building, it had its walls and it had its windows. She didn't feel like the building was making any sort of statement about anything in particular. Probably about being a neat and tidy place, if anything.

Stormcat entered without any sign of apprehension and Buggy just followed her inside, onto what was obviously a reception of sorts, a couple of couches with a coffee table in between, calm music could be heard coming from somewhere within the reception, with magazines and newspapers on the coffee table and even a reception desk past that, giving the impression that they had entered a lobby rather than a dorm.

""¬†*Guten Morgen*¬†. What can I do for you?"" A girl manning the desk said.

Buggy was somewhat startled by the voice as she didn't realize someone else was in that room with them. Now that she paid closer attention, the girl behind the desk looked both serious as well as somewhat reluctant to be at her current station. Or perhaps a bit too distant. So far Buggy had interacted with a whole bunch of extroverted Kansen, so this would be her first interaction with someone that was more on the quiet side.

The girl had short dark brown hair held on a few braids, 2 small ones framing her face, and most notably her tidy and somewhat complex uniform that drapped her in dark blues, red and golden accents, A beret on her head and most notably a puppet that seemed to be made out of metal on her right arm.

""Eh, we came to see whoever has the food."" Stormcat stated.

Buggy¬¥s mind came to a screeching halt upon hearing her companion's words. Many ideas and words came to mind as well as possible implications of what could be actually going on, all coalescing into one simple statement.

""For the love of- you just wanted to have Iron Blood food?!"" She asked in disbelief.

""Er... I mean, it is a bit more complex than that..."" Stormcat replied inching away from her superior.

""Oh! wait, you two are Valkyries visiting, aren't you?"" The girl manning the desk asked.

""I see... it makes sense. I hear you sometimes make a pilgrimage to the¬†*Vaterland*¬†, but I suppose it makes sense to want to come and visit¬†*Mutter*¬†if you happen to be here. And you should be hungry."" The girl said as she eyed the two of them.

Before hearing their responses, the girl checked a clipboard she had nearby, flipping the pages and nodding a few times to herself.

""Right now, both¬†*Mutter*¬†as well as¬†*Herr*¬†Bismarck are in a meeting with the commander, but they should probably arrive after lunch time"" She quickly stated going over any possible counter argument that Buggy could even come up with.

""You are free to remain here at the reception if you wish to. But If you are feeling peckish, Miss Th√ºringen should be practicing in the kitchen and she could be able to prepare something for you.""

""Yes, that would be ideal!"" Stormcat replied before Buggy could even say something.

""Understood, please follow me. My name is Georg Thiele, I¬¥ll guide you to our kitchen."" The girl said, nodding at them in acknowledgement.

""Ah, nice to meet you. I am Stormcat, er... just Stormcat, I suppose."" Stormcat said.

""Nice to meet you, I am Buggy of the Eagle Union¬¥s Valkyries"" Buggy managed to introduce herself, coming to a better known territory for her, quick and simple self introductions.

""Likewise"" The girl stated, she nodded marginally in response and turned around, making her way into the dorm building without waiting for a response.

Buggy wanted to explain that while she was in fact hungry, her main reason to visit the Iron Blood dorms within Azur Lane was not something as unseemly as wanting to taste their local food. She had no real counter argument at that, and while she frantically went over which arguments she could probably bring regarding such a thing, she continued following Stormcat and the IronBlood destroyer.

Her opportunity to explain herself became slimmer when she realized that they had already entered the kitchen within the dorms. She became immediately fixated on how big and tidy the place was, everything seemed like it had been cleaned purposefully with the intent to host visitors, or probably an inspection. Which was pretty much on point with what she had experienced of the people from Iron Blood.

Then again, an inspection was probably taking place already, as she noticed there were three more people in the place. One of them was dressed like a maid of sorts. Truth be told, Buggy had not had much exposure to the whole maid culture until she came to Azur Lane, where the exposure to such a thing had been above and beyond what she had thought possible.

Some of the royal Maids had made her wish she could make some, less than professional requests from then, on a more private setting. So all in all she found some trouble trying to concentrate whenever there was a group of maids working. And this time wasn't an exception as the low cuts, present around everywhere on their attires, had distracted her enough that yet another conversation had already started before she could fully realize it.

""Guttern morgen, Miss Gneisenau, Miss Scharnhost, Miss Th√ºringen, these girls are Valkyries visiting us, they have come to visit¬†*Mutter*, and they also want some food.""

Without giving much else of an explanation, the Iron Blood girl simply nodded and made her way out of the kitchen while everyone else remained a little bit confused by the statements.

Once George had left the kitchen everyone looked at each other as if trying to make sense of what had happened, as if the others had more information about what was taking place.

And one of them decided then that was how things must actually be like.

""You are Valkyries then, correct?"" A tall Iron Blood woman asked them.

Buggy was once again surprised by how different each Kansen seemed to be, as well as how bold they could be regarding their attires.

In front of her stood an Iron Blood Kansen with striking blue eyes framed by professional-looking red-rimmed-glasses, long straight lilac-colored hair, wearing a cap, part of her uniform of dark blue color with red accents, if it could be called an uniform, really. She wore rather small shorts, and thigh highs, a jacked that seemed like a pointless piece of wardrobe as it both exposed her midriff as well as her shoulders, and her sizeable chest was barely contained held by a white shirt that was once again fully exposed by the jacket.

""Buggy, you are staring too much again"" Stormcat chided softly at her companion, bringing her out of her daze.

""Ma'am! I am sorry, I didn't mean to stare but if only respectfully!"" Buggy quickly babbled as she stood at attention.

""It is all fine."" the other girl sitting beside that particular Kansen answered. ""While most would readily assume it is improper, we won't easily shy away from someone willing to appreciate fine Iron Blood engineering.""

""You are completely fine-eh-Right!! You are completely right ma'am!."" Buggy quickly replied, composing herself mid sentence as best as she could.

The second Kansen was apparently related to the first, with the same build, same hair color, and similar uniform just slightly different on some parts, covering more of her body and yet somehow displaying much more at the same time. but most notable on her was an eyepatch covering her left eye.

""I think we might be teasing her too much as it is,"" The third Iron Blood Kansen in the room said, one with calm blue eyes and long gray hair, being for some reason dressed like a maid.

""Yes. Please, let's just disregard my friend while she overcomes her sudden bout of shyness."" Stormcat said with a grin to her face.

""Wait no! dont disregard me-!.. a-bah ba- I mean!"" Buggy tried to complain about the implication of her getting shy around the Kansen, but she only managed to fumble her own words in a majestic fashion ending up covering her face for a couple of seconds trying to hide her blushing face while she put one finger up, indicating for everyone else to give her a few moments to compose herself.

""While that is comical enough, it would probably be for the best to make note it would be on her best interest that she doesn't meet Eugen, or she will risk most of her vocab being teased out of her"" One of the two sisters said, the one with glasses, stating it in a matter-of-fact way, to which the other Iron Blood Kansen simply agreed by nodding in acknowledgement.

""Anyway, I am Scharnhorst, this is my sister Gneisenau and this is Th√ºringen."" The Iron Blood girl with the eyepatch introduced each one as she signaled at them with her hand, with each one nodding minutely in response.

It was obvious she was done with their introductions as they looked intently at Stormcat and Buggy.

Stormcat had enough experience dealing with Iron Blood people to be able to pick on such a cue, she looked at Buggy who had recovered enough to seem at least ready to introduce herself properly if left to her own devices, and probably if left alone with people with less distracting attires.

""This is Buggy, and I am Stormcat, both of the Eagle Union Valkyries."" She introduced both of them in a simple manner, signaling each one of them.

""Oh? At first I thought you were a Tiger, but that doesn't seem to be the case at all."" Gneisenau said as she fixed her glasses and looked at Stormcat with a much more appreciative look.¬≠ ""So tell me, what brings you to the Iron Blood dorms? You don't seem to be Zealous enough about your origin to be looking for Miss Freiderich, nor¬†*Herr*¬†Bismarck.""

""Well yeah, that would be interesting in itself, I suppose, with our origins and all that."" Stormcat said as much while shrugging in a noncommittal fashion.

""I am here for the food."" Stormcat stated, again.

""What do you even mean with that?!"" Buggy exclaimed, once again bothered by such a statement coming from her friend.

""You have heard before how important it is for the Tigers back home to come and meet Miss Friederich and Miss Bismarck! This is kind of disrespectful!"" Even though Buggy wanted to shout at her friend due to how wrong all this situation seemed to her, she managed to keep her voice low, and she even managed to somehow whisper the last part of her statement.

""I mean, we are proud of food, so we can probably just indulge your request, even if it's a little odd."" Th√ºringen, the maidly dressed Iron Blood Kansen said as she eyed Stormcat.¬≠

""Oh really?! Thank you! Now I'll really know if Emma and Emilia are pulling my tail about their food being actually great or if they are just pranking me with their bad rations.""

She said as much, as she looked at her friend with a pleased look on her face, nonetheless she failed to notice that everyone else in the room had a look of confusion on their faces.

""Wait, what do you mean by their bad rations? Iron Blood rations? Is that why you are here?"" Buggy all but hissed back at her friend.

""Eh? I mean, yeah, a couple of our companions back home are two Tigers, sent there as part of the Valkyrie exchange system and what not"" Stormcat said matter-of-factly, as she more or less gave her answer as a simple explanation to everyone in the room.

""Wait, two Tigers have shared their rations with you? Iron Blood Valkyrie Tigers?!"" Scharnhorst asked with a look of disbelief on her face.

""I mean, yeah? There are two Tiger Valkyries on base, I often get teamed with them because they seem to respond positively to me, I think?. Tough girls, just seem like their responses to most things are too intense at times."" Stormcat said as she shrugged her shoulders.

""Like, at the end of missions they would make a point of making a campfire and heat up some of their rations. They would constantly brag about how the real dish,¬†*'from the vatherland'*¬†would be so much better while giving us canned stuff that I could barely palate."" She said as she pantomimed the gestures made by the Tiger Valkyries in question.

Stormcat continued explaining, completely blind to how the Kansen from the Iron Blood, as well as her own companion, were looking at her with astonishment evident on their faces.

""Er... I don't think I have ever been offered any of their rations"" Buggy said while looking at Stormcat who seemed agitated over the whole canned food situation.

""Actually I don't think I have heard of anyone else being offered some of their stuff"" Buggy commented softly as she pondered on the issue.

¬†

Everyone remained quiet as the statements seemed to confuse everyone in the room, even Stormcat who wasn't aware that no one else had tried the Iron Blood rations.

""You must be a hell of a fighter then!"" Scharnhorst loudly stated as she crossed her arms, breaking the silence that had fallen onto the room, looking at Stormcat with a whole different look on her face, evidently reevaluating her opinion of the Valkyrie in front of her.

""Eh?!"" Stormcat said intelligently, looking like a cat startled by the IronBlood girl raising her voice. Her two tufts of hair, which resembled cat ears, also flopped backwards in response to her surprise.

""They must really appreciate you."" Her sister Gneisenau added, accommodating her glasses as she looked intently at Stormcat and Buggy, stopping if only to look at Th√ºringen and nodding at her, part of some interaction that went completely over the Valkyries heads.

""Ok then, I suppose this would be a great opportunity to put my skills to the test. But with things as they are, I am thinking we should also call for Nurnberg."" Th√ºringen said in response to Gneisenau's meaningful look at her.

""That seems like the right thing to do. No offense meant to you, Th√ºringen. You are quite accomplished at this, but Nurnberg really has a way to bring the flavour of the fatherland onto any dish."" Geneisenau said.

""None taken, I know what you mean. I don't intend to presume I can bring the best to the table, and I am quite happy knowing my skills are developing. I wish I was able to bring some of the 'old flavours' I remember to everyone, but until I reach a decent enough level, I am happy to continue practicing.""

""Now if you will excuse me, ill go for her then."" Th√ºringen said, making a minute curtsy while holding her attire, leaving without much fanfare.

""Now, come sit, I will serve you some good beer. Iron Blood cuisine is meant to be served warm and with a cold drink on hand."" Scharnhorst said as she stood up and started looking at the cabinets within the kitchen.

""heh, they have said as much before."" Stormcat said as she took a seat that had been offered by Gneisenau, with Buggy following suit next to her

""Hah! They must really like you."" Scharnhorst said with a rather jovial tone to her as she continued going over the kitchen, now holding two tall glasses intended for their drinks.¬†

""You should probably remain at the dorm until Miss Friederich comes back, she will surely want to hear from your interactions with Emma and Emilia. Really, she is always delighted when she hears something from her 'Valkyrie daughters' """,2,1734230575.0,AzureLane,0,1.0,False

1hej2bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1hej2bq/frequent_urination/,Frequent Urination,"Hello. I am currently being tested for POTS as i have many of the symptoms according to my DR and own research.

Tonight, I have been having frequent urination, every 45 minutes, and it's a lot. (Didn't measure) It's clear and I have not had many fluids today. Maybe 20oz of water and 10oz of coffee at most. I am bad at drinking fluids. Regardless, I am urinating a lot and very often + clear.

It does not burn or hurt. Some days I will drink a ton of water and not pee for 8 hours. Then there's days like this where I am not really hydrated yet I am going very often.

I am really worried about this and want to know if it's POTS related. I saw one post that seemed to confirm but I was confused by some of the comments. 

Also diagnosed Hashimoto's, if that's anything. ",1,1734230385.0,POTS,3,1.0,False

I really wanna stay there once law school is done so I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to integrate myself better? Something they have done or had someone do that worked??",2,1734229365.0,LawFirm,5,1.0,False
1heir2q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1heir2q,Help me pick color of walls!,"I am buying a house sight unseen and would really like to have the walls painted before the family moves in. I am leaning towards BM white dove, BM swiss coffee or SW greek villa. I would like to paint all downstairs the same color (living room, kitchen). I want something creamy but without looking yellow. If I paint the walls any of those colors, would BM Natural Cream look good on the cabinets if I change the hardware? I plan on expanding this island later on. The floor is white oak.

1heimsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/1heimsd/apologies_to_the_raid_team_i_was_on/,Apologies to the raid team I was on...,"Joined a raid for the first time today and feel like I was more of a liability than a help. When I joined, there was only the leader on the team and he had taken out EN06 already and was working on the drill stage. I tried defending the drill, but kept getting overwhelmed. We eventually had 4 and I still got swamped. I ten tried running fuel, and I think I did better there, but we still failed the stage. Ended up having to log off before we ever beat the stage.

This is kind of discouraging. I'm running a full overeaters set of excavator, and I was using an anti armor, rapid (I forget the 3rd star) gatling plasma. Then I switched to an anti armor explosive (don't remember) single barrel gauss minigun.

I'm running gun fu so I can just hold the trigger down as long as I have ap. I did try drinking coffee, which is helpful. 

Not sure what to do in able to help on the raid. I'd really like to experience the content and I want to get the new power armor. I'm level 405 or so. Anyone have suggestions? I've watched videos and based my build on angry turtles build. 

Any help would be appreciated, and like I said, sorry to the group I was with. I hope you got through the drill stage!",1,1734228857.0,Market76,16,0.54,False
