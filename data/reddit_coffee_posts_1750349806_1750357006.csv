My main concern is it has a entity (fish-fiend ghost) from my culture. Does the entity sound vague to others in the story?","# #Chapter 1: Fishy Beginnings

***A new office, a big investor, and the first whiff of trouble.***



After their long-awaited Series A funding, [AroKhabo.ai](http://AroKhabo.ai), a proudly Bengali tech startup disrupting the food delivery industry with AI, IoT, and vibes moved into a shiny new “smart” office in Sector V, overlooking a long-abandoned fishery.

The founders, Atreyo (atheist, rationalist, chronic avoider of HR meetings) and Ritoban (the CTO known to debug in Sanskrit and who once claimed to merge code during lunar eclipses, would not leave coding to the devs), had built a sleek ghost kitchen management system that catered to influencers who wanted a restaurant brand without the actual headache of running one. Their tech could handle everything; from brand identity to hyperlocal market testing to AI-generated butter chicken campaigns-all without chopping a single onion.

But when they moved into the new office, something... fishy began.

Atreyo addressed the team during their inauguration party: “In a month, our investor from Singapore is visiting. Vegan. Very ethical. I want results. Big, bold, tofu-compatible results.”

But then, it began. The unmistakable scent of frying hilsa in mustard oil curled through the vents like ancestral disapproval.

The team sniffed confusion into their startup-grade air. Atreyo had approved a 100% fish-free menu for the party. No one could find the source and chalked it up to something in the ventilation system.



# #Chapter 2: The Smell That Wouldn’t Leave

**Tiffin theft, fishy fumes, and a suspicious HR presentation.**



The smell never really left. Every day at odd intervals, the office filled with ghostly traces of the unmistakable aroma of frying fish. The smart kitchen designed with facial recognition, calorie tracking, and a terrifyingly loud fire alarm, was always kept pristine. And yet, the scent lingered. It drifted into strategy meetings. It curled into brainstorming sessions. The scent drifted through the meeting room vents, curled beneath bean bags, and settled like judgment in the HR cubicle.

“Do you smell.....?” Ritoban started one day.

Atreyo cut him off. “It’s your imagination. Focus on the dashboard metrics.”

Then, a new menace started to plague the employees. Employees complained that their tiffins, especially the ones with fish, were mysteriously vanishing from the fridge. No one could see anyone taking out the tiffin from the fridge. Security cameras caught nothing. Only the fridge stood ominously.

The weekly HR slideshow, “Lunch Theft and Conduct Policy,” on professional etiquette and lunchbox consent, was mysteriously replaced by a passive-aggressive Google Slides titled:



# #“5 Ways to Properly Cook Hilsa (And Why You’re Doing It Wrong)”

The opening slide featured anonymous (but clearly employee-specific) critiques:

* “Microwaving fish in foil? Yes, you exactly know who you are.” 
* “Paneer twice in a week? Might be the reason your girlfriend left you?” 
* “Fish in mayonnaise? Seek help to fix that childhood trauma.” 

Everyone blamed HR for the passive-aggressiveness of the meeting, and though she denied it, she had to go through an HR meeting.



# #Chapter 3: Slack Chaos

**When bots go rogue and sushi becomes sacred.**



But it was not the end. The tiffin thief still on the loose, employees decided not to bring fish to office at all. The situation somehow worsened.

Slack channels formed new subthreads titled #fishfeelings, #hilsahelpdesk, #bonelessbutnotbrainless.

The in-house AI agent, KhaabarBot, which previously created eerily accurate customer personas, now described users like:

* “Shrabani, 29, childhood trauma rooted in dried fish curry, orders sushi to self-soothe.” 
* “Partho, 34, hiding his Rui addiction under a Keto facade, deeply misses his mother’s mouralla fry.” 
* “Abir, 33, secretly cries when biriyani has no aloo.” 

Clients started receiving fish facts in newsletters. The latest SaaS patch notes included:

* “Chitol > Bhetki. This is a hill I will die on.” “Fixed bug where ‘docker-compose up’ summoned smell of fried hilsa.”
* “Bugfix: GhostAPI.ts no longer exposes cursed recipes.”

Confusion grew. The fridge kept auto-locking but occasionally hissed like a pressure cooker. The company 



Glassdoor page began filling up with bizarre reviews:

* “Great workplace, but why is there no fish in the pantry fridge?” 
* “Benefits: PF, ESOP, spectral companionship.”  

No one knew who was behind it. But no one panicked. Not yet.

Atreyo blamed rival sabotage and vowed to take revenge. He hired a tech detective.



# #Chapter 4: DevOps & Divine Possession 

***Namaste, npm start***



It wasn’t long before Ritoban changed.



Debugging was now ""aligning chakras of the codebase."" He wore only dhotis. Started each stand-up by blowing into a conch shell. Began treating code commits as sacred offerings.

Interns ran. Devs prayed. The tech detective ghosted.

Funny bug reports started showing up in Jira:

* “Fish smell in production?!”
* “Ghost changed DB password to ‘ilish4ever’. Cannot deploy.”
* “Slack bot replaced /remind with /reheat-hilsa. Pls revert.”

A rogue file named haunting.js was found in production.



    export const summon = (spirit) => {
    
      return spirit.includes(""ilish"") ? ""DEEP FRY"" : ""IGNORE"";
    
    };



The interns felt as much. The dev team saw Ritoban swallow whole trays of sushi in a blink. They too started to believe something supernatural was behind this.

Atreyo tried to dismiss it as a burnout-fueled breakdown.

But he couldn’t dismiss KhaabaBot going haywire. Khaaba.ai’s Twitter, once sleek and witty, now tweeted things like:

* “Bhetki > Butter Chicken. Change my mind.”
* “Paneer is a conspiracy. Tofu is a lie.”
* “We stan Rui.”  

When Atreyo confronted the dev team, the lead engineer simply whispered:

“I think the bot… is possessed.”

“There is no ghost,” Atreyo muttered, sipping black coffee as the office printer spat out hand-drawn fish diagrams. “Just a hiccup in our deployment pipeline.”



# #Chapter 5: The Fishucation Pivot

***From ghost kitchens to ghost-fueled edtech.***



Then came the town hall. Ritoban entered, dhoti and shawl, hair slicked back like a villain in a Satyajit Ray noir.

“My fellow machh-lovers,” he announced, “we are pivoting.”



>Slide 1: “Fishucation: Scaling Shorshe for the Next Generation”

He grinned. “No more ghost kitchens for influencers. From now on, we are an edtech platform for Bengali fish cuisine. For the culture.”

The whole team stared openmouthed.

“We’re launching Fishucation™,” he continued. “India’s first AI-powered platform for mastering Bengali fish cuisine. From online cooking classes to fish-based memory palaces.”

One intern asked, “What about ghost kitchens?”

Ritoban’s eyes gleamed. “Every kitchen is a ghost kitchen if you believe.”



Jira tickets began autofilling with tasks like:

* “Build fish recipe recommender system”
* “Gamify fish deboning for Gen Z”
* “NFT fish loyalty program”
* “Replace hamburger menu icon with fish emoji”  

# #Chapter 6: Your request to deploy tofu_compatible_campaign.js has failed.

Meanwhile, the company's reputation was at stake. Clients got mackerel recipes instead of campaign timelines. Press releases read like obituaries for fish. A client demo began with the projector showing the Top 10 Ways to Marinate Catla.

The interns, overworked and underfed, began to suspect something supernatural.

Atreyo was in denial.

“There is no ghost,” he muttered to himself. “We just need to refactor our culture.”

But the final straw came when their vegan investor from Singapore preponed the office visit after getting to know about the erratic tweets and client complaints. He was coming in a week to see for himself what was with the new cavalier social media campaign with KhaabaBot.



Atreyo begged Ritoban to take a break. “Think of it as a sabbatical. For… the codebase.”

Ritoban: “We shall teach the world to cook fish. With AI. For the culture.”

Ritoban divulged the great pitch for the investor—live streaming demo of butchering and deboning a whole Hilsa, for education, of course.

With the vegan investor from Singapore scheduled to visit in a week, panic set in.

They couldn’t let Ritoban pitch Fishucation to him. That would end not just the company, but possibly the entire Bengali reputation for tech excellence.

Atreyo said he would manage. Ritoban just needed a vision board and corporate vacation time, and all would be well.

But the interns knew better. The CTO needed something more. Something only an exorcist, and perhaps a decent hilsa fry could resolve.



# #Chapter 7: Spirits and SaaS 

***Deploy, Debug, Detangle the Demon***



So, they did what any desperate startup team would do.

Desperate, they turned to the last hope: a remote exorcist on Urban Company.



She advertised:

# #“Remote AI-powered blockchain-verified exorcisms. Free Discord after-exorcism spiritual support for 7 days.”



Her name was Tanmoyee, and she had a Discord server called #SpiritsAndSaaS. She appeared on a Zoom call late one night as the interns gathered, half-praying, half-debugging. She had a neon aura filter. Lo-fi mantras played on Spotify.

“Show me the entity,” she said.

They did.

Ritoban was in the pantry gobbling raw fish.

Tanmoyee lit a virtual incense stick (really just a looping gif), chanted something in Sanskrit that sounded suspiciously like Kotlin, and stared directly at Ritoban through the webcam.

“You are not the CTO,” she said.

“I AM THE CURRY. I AM THE CUTLET,” Ritoban thundered.

The lights flickered. Slack crashed. The smart fridge garbled. When th lights came back, Ritoban had dissapeared.

“Do not fear,” she said. “I specialize in haunted IoT.”

“Let us begin.”

First, she overlaid a sigil-laced screensaver over the office projector, Mandala runes drawn in Visio, rotating clockwise to lo-fi beats.

She instructed the interns to place wireless mice in a perfect circle around the possessed fridge. They chanted the Wi-Fi password in reverse. The microwave door began opening and shutting by itself.

“Offer the ghost something it cannot resist,” Tanmoyee intoned.

The interns brought forward a lunchbox containing perfectly cooked hilsa in mustard. She chanted in a hybrid of 

Sanskrit and JavaScript:



    console.log(""Leave this corporeal Kubernetes cluster!"");

She ran a script labeled: POSSESSION\_FIREWALL.sh



Ritoban stormed in, garlanded in curry leaves, brandishing a fish skeleton.

“You mock the ilish?” he bellowed. “The mustard shall rise!”

“Contain him!” Tanmoyee commanded.

She recited a chant that sounded suspiciously like a product launch deck:

“Quarter four KPIs, divine integration, Hilsa align, break this possession relation!”

“You,” she said solemnly, “you will leave this office and go back to your fishery.”

Ritoban howled. “Never...”

The lights flickered. Alexa screamed. The biometric fridge unlocked on its own and flung open,revealing nothing but bones. Ritoban, fully possessed, appeared.

He threw a handful of mustard powder at interns; some began to cry.

Tanmoyee yelled: “Begone, you fish-smelled ghoul!”

Tanmoyee clapped once. “BEGONE, O MECHHO.”

Tanmoyee clapped twice. “BEGONE, O MECHHO.”

The mantra ended. So, noted in the process well for ISO audit.

And just like that, it ended.

The smell vanished. Jira returned to normal. KhaabaBot apologized. Ritoban collapsed, mumbling.

Tanmoyee pulled up a Figma map.

“I am geofencing your office spiritually. This tulsi-based firewall is synced with your biometric scanners.”

A circle of protection activated. The pantry light turned warm.

Slack stabilized. Jira stopped assigning random fish tasks.

Epilogue: Cache Cleared, Spirit Remains

Atreyo never acknowledged the incident.

But the interns knew.

Deep in the pantry, under an expired hummus tub, a note appeared:

**“This isn't over. Tofu is still being served. We will meet again. Yours, Fishfully, M.B.”**

**Background.** I am an older person, someone in their 60's. I am someone who has to work. I cannot call it quits and retire. God knows why, but I have always had a problem finding work, no matter what kind of work it is. Some people can just walk into some place or apply online for something like BK, Home Depot or Target get a call back and get hired. I am not one of them.

I was fired from a remote job as a Service Desk Analyst at the beginning of April because I dropped I said a swear word when I spilled coffee on my selfnot knowing that a caller was on the line due to a malfunction with a software package the company used. I have been searching for a job since. I need a job. I can only barely make it through the month of July. Remote service desk jobs have completely dried up and there are none in the area I live in. To relocate is impossible unless I would have a job lined up. IF I did relocate the there would be only one or two of those type of jobs in the area I would be relocacting to as those jobs are disappearing at an alaming rate. They were plentiful for years but no longer.

I've had a couple of interviews but I did not get those jobs.

The user manual mentions you should not base the heat off of a single pull, so I assume multiple pulls will make it hotter.

So I (22f) recently got asked out for coffee by a customer (22m) at my place of work. Before he asked me out I had seen him and thought he was cute. But I’m at work so I wasn’t going to do anything ( it is just a job I have til September but still).

I work in a clothing store, so I do have to go up to people and ask them if they needed help. When I went up to him I noticed that he got really red from the neck up. Which was very flattering and cute. This happened later again when I said something else to him.

Then at the till I was tempted to write my number on the receipt but I didn’t. But by then I think we both realized that we found each other attractive and friendly. He then stood there for a second before sheepishly asking me if I would like to go for a coffee sometime to which I said yes and ushered him away from the til and gave him my phone number.

We talked for a few minutes and it did feel unusually natural. He then told me he would be away sailing for two weeks and he would like to meet up afterwards.

He texted me a few hours later, to which I replied that it was it was very nice of him today and he said basically along the lines that he enjoyed it too ( I don’t leave in a English speaking country) and wrote again that he would like to text me when he is back to arrange a date.

That was on the 6th of June. I say he will be back by Sunday.

My question is how long should I wait for him to text me or basically how long would a man wait from coming back from a trip to text a girl to arrange a date?",0,1750356427.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

I don’t have much in the way of extended family and am more or less completely alone. I lived with my dad until his passing and now come home to an empty house with the exception of my two dogs.

My older brother has all but ignored me and has been unsupportive of me and dismissive of my grief. I’ve been there for and helped him, my sister-in-law and their children countless times over the years, often with little to no notice, but it has never been reciprocated. Have always been there for them in times of need, but they haven’t been there for me and have not reached out to see if I am ok and almost never answered calls/texts.

My older sister has been a verbally and emotionally abusive bully for many years - most of my life, really - but particularly and exceedingly so since our dad’s diagnosis a few years ago and worse still since he passed. I have been her primary target and have endured so much harassment, threats, verbal/emotional abuse, controlling behavior, smears, manipulation, etc. from her. It has drained me physically, emotionally and has caused a fair amount of financial hurt, too. I‘m also grieving the possibility of losing our family home - my only source of comfort and familiarity at this point - and would like very much to buy out her share, but she so far has refused even though she doesn’t want the house for herself and already has a lovely home of her own that was purchased with financial help from our dad. Her goal seems to be hurtful toward me in any way possible. I’ve always been her punching bag and it’s no diffin this situation.

Older brother cut me off completely months ago, not so much because of anything I’ve done, but because of all the chaos older sister has created. I started seeing a counselor about a year and a half ago for grief counseling, but also to help me deal with the abusive behavior from my sister.  On the advice of my counselor, I began going low/no-contact with my sister this past winter and I guess she must’ve begun hassling our brother more because I was responding less and less at her attempts to intimidate, control and hassle me.  That’s the only reason I can think of why my brother cut me off, as I’ve not tried to bother or call him and have stayed out of his way, so to speak.

He’s always been aware of how abusive she has been to me, but has made me feel and more or less said that I just have to shut up and put up with it or that I have to be inconvenienced financially and otherwise in order to appease her. I’ve been burdened with so much of the abuse and I guess when taking steps to protect myself and my sanity by going low/no-contact, it made things worse for me in a way. 

As for having anyone else in my life, the few friends/neighbors and extended family I ***do*** have are rarely available and not terribly good about responding to texts or calls. They never seem to have time for something even as simple as a walk or grabbing a coffee. I don’t expect someone to be instantly available and always ask well in advance, but even then, no one seems to have the time or I get brushed off and when I try again later, they are still “too busy” or don’t even respond.

I’m tired of always being the one to reach out and getting little to no response. No one ever bothers to reach out to or check on me and I wish that they would occasionally. Being the one that always makes the effort is exhausting and when it gets you nowhere, you just feel like giving up after awhile.

I’ve also done all of the usual things people suggest like volunteering, taking a class, joining a club, visiting a support group - have tried several of those and they were all poorly run - going to church services, the theater, etc. and that hasn’t helped either. It seems everyone there already has their own established little group and no matter how pleasant and engaging I try to be, I always end up on the sidelines. People exchange pleasantries and are nice enough at first, but then go back to their little groups of friends and I end up feeling like the kid on the playground that no one wants around or on their team.

I’m to the point where I am so lonely that I often get in the car and just drive around aimlessly or I think of a reason to go to the grocery store or library just so I’m around other people. I’m just so tired of things being this way and not changing despite all of my efforts. Being this lonely is excruciating and, if it weren’t for my two dogs, I would be a complete wreck. 😞",5,1750356403.0,GenXWomen,0,1.0,False

1lfhmsa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfhmsa,TRIP REPORT! Ring Road in 9 Days // End of May,"Thank you to this sub! Hoping this can be helpful to others. We drove the ring road in 9 days. 

HIGHLIGHTS
- Deig (Rekyjavik): great bagel sandwhiches, donuts (grab extra to enjoy at the end of a hike 😉), and coffee. The red pesto cream cheese!!! Very affordable for Iceland
- Reykjadalur Hot Spring Thermal River: an absolutely unique experience! Worth the hike. 
- Skogafoss: even with the crowds this was just magical
- Dyrhólaey Cliffs: an INSANE view from every angle. Feels like the edge of the earth. We ended up walking for about 2 miles along the coast. 
- Mulagljufur Canyon: was a bit concerned about this being rated ""hard"" on AllTrails, but it wasn't too difficult. Definitely worth the effort! We filled our water bottles from the stream, it was the best water I've ever had.
- Zodiac Boat Tour (Jökulsárlón): I am typically not one for tours but this was incredible. Unlike anything I've ever seen. Really glad we did this over the kayaking tour as you're able to get much farther out into the lagoon.
- Vox Baths: arrived around 2pm and had the place mostly 2 ourselves for a few hours. Very clean and modern with all the amenities of the more expensive spas near Reykjavik. Looooved jumping into the lake. Wish I could teleport here!
- Seydisfjordur: looooved this weird little town. Incredible views, art sprinkled throughout, great food options especially for the size. Had a lovely dinner at Skaftafell Bistro!
- Beitarhúsið: a cafe in the northeast along the ring road in the middle of nowhere. Delicious, reasonably priced veal soup. Was really happy to stumble upon this place.
- Hverfjall: absolutely my favorite part of the Lake Myvatn area—views worth fighting th bugs for!
- Vogafjós Farm Restaurant: they say farm to table and they MEAN it. Reasonably priced especially for the quality. You can see the sheep/cows from your seat.
- Godafoss: nearly no effort to get to from the parking lot, but offers remarkable views. I enjoyed this much more than Dettifoss the day before which is a bit of a  treck to get to.
- Akureyi: we loved just walking around! The art museum exceeded my expectations and had a great cafe/gift shop. We also stumbled upon ""Fairytale Figures"" in someone's backyard, definitely check it out if you like weird art.
- Snaeffsness: hiked from Hellnar to Arnastoppi—loved it! Really peaceful. 
- Sjávarpakkhúsið (Snaeffsness): one of my favorite meals, higher end but more affordable and better portions than seafood restaurants in the US. 
- Sundhöllin (Reykjavik public pool): went here our last day and it wa the perfect way to end our trip. Made us so incredibly sad to leave! Mostly locals of all ages. If you do go be sure to shower beforehand and respect the rules. 


FUN BUT NOT A MUST
- Sky Lagoon: we went on our first day after arriving at 6am from the US. Was definitely a nice place to relax, but it had more of a party feel overall and felt very artificial. 
- Braud and co: the cinnamon rolls...are cinnamon rolls
- Frioheimar: the food is good, but not the end of the world if you can't fit it in! We were able to get a table for 2 around 3pm without a reservation 
- Horsebackriding, Vik Black Sand Beaches: a nice experience, but I think if I were to go back in time I would like to save the $$$ and explore the area by foot. Those cuties are slooooow let me tell ya!


PASS
- Black Crust Pizzeria, Vik: 100% an overpriced, gimicky tourist trap. The pizza crust is hard and tasteless. Grab a sandwich at the grocery store next door instead!
- Svartifoss: not worth the squeeze! The trail is essentially all incline, very crowded, and we found the  view underwhelming.
- Diamond Beach: Maybe it's just because we went here directly after the glacier lagoon boat tour, but we found this to be incredibly underwhelming. Worth a stop if you need a break from driving but I wouldn't go out of my way.
- Vestrahorn: this is the one location where I felt a but misled by social media images. You definitely need to go at a very specific time of day to get the reflective views you see online. It is pretty though! 
- Viti Crater: it's very blue I will say 😂, but I think stayed for less than 5 minutes? One of those things you just see and then carry on. ",2,1750356331.0,VisitingIceland,0,1.0,False

He said it was his friend for a long time, almost 10 years I think. I don't have a problem with them being friends, bc I have a guy friend that i've known for almost 12/13 years that I still keep up with or hang out with. However, we have boundaries set. He doesn't text me late at night, unless it's an emergency with him or someone in the friend group. We say love you, but only when we're leaving each other after hanging out. Like ""Okay get home safe! Love you!"" Like i don't TEXT him ""I love you"" ..and when we hang out, I always keep my bf updated and aware of what we're doing, and now that i've started dating him, I almost NEVER hang out with him 1 on 1. Maybe for a little bit while we're waiting for other friends to arrive, but never an intentional 1 on 1 hangout bc my bf has mentioned that he wouldn't like it. 

They hang out frequently 1 on 1, often with him telling me ""oh we're getting coffee"" and next thing I know he's walking in the house not sober bc they went out and got drinks before smoking at her place. Other times i'll be up at 3 am bc i can't sleep, and I'll hear is phone go off twice back to back. Obviously, getting a text at 3am out of no where, makes you immediately want to see who texted. So i pick up the phone to read it and it's his girl best friend saying ""I love you 🤍"" and then ""I miss you 🤍"". 

I can't help but feel like it's not appropriate!!! I've said to to him before but he brushed it off like ""i've known her forever, it's not like that."" and then he'll go and TEXT HER that i'm upset about it. IN MY FACE. Like wtf?! Am I crazy or am i justified in feeling disrespected when he does that? Am I a hypocrite!!? I don't know anymore 💔

1lfhlbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FTMMen/comments/1lfhlbp/how_do_i_rebuild_myself/,How do I rebuild myself?,"We were together for five years.
From age 17 to 23, we grew up alongside each other. First real love. Deep care. I supported her through panic attacks, burnout, and family struggles. Her parents treated me like a son. We talked about the future—seriously. Marriage, kids, careers.

Then we broke up — March 12th, officially.

It was mutual on the surface, but in reality, I didn’t want it. She said she needed space to feel like herself again. That she didn’t know who she was outside of us. I gave her that space, still loving her deeply.

But what came next broke me.

Timeline:

March 12: Official breakup. Emotional. Still warm. We agreed on no contact, but it didn’t hold. We still saw each other, still texted. Still something there.

End of March: We went on a trip to Ermelo together for five days. Yes, post-breakup. Still shared moments. Still slept in the same bed. I thought maybe we had a shot.

May 5th (Bevrijdingsdag): She tried to kiss me. I said: “Is that a good idea?” Still, I had hope.

May 6–9: She continued texting me like normal. Selfies, warmth, inside jokes. No signs of distance.

Later I found out: She had already gone on a walk with a new guy the Saturday after May 5th, planned a dinner date, and on May 31st, they went to the Efteling together.

June 1st: Out of nowhere she sent a cold text saying she had been “seeing someone for 3 weeks,” felt like herself again, and didn’t want any contact. Said our story was 100% done.


She cut off everything. Not just romance, but friendship too.

I felt erased. Like she waited until someone else came along to really let go.
I was still in it emotionally. Still healing. Still holding on.
And she was already laughing with someone else, texting new firsts, doing things we used to do.

Some mutual friends told me, “She didn’t upgrade. The guy seems indifferent.”
That stuck with me.

Because I showed up. I supported her. I loved her through her darkest days.
And when the sun came out again… she walked away like none of it mattered.

I don’t want her back. But I’m haunted.
By the way she left.
By the way it felt like she needed to erase me to be happy again.

Even now, her mom keeps in touch with me. Her dad is disappointed in how she handled it. That says something… and yet it doesn't undo the ache.

I’m 23. And I have no idea who I am without her.
I feel like I skipped the phase where you date around, fail, get your heart broken, explore.
I went all in, and it wasn’t enough.

How do I build myself again after that?
How do I trust again?
How do I feel like me again?

Any advice from people who rebuilt themselves after being the one left behind?

I am currently finishing my bachelor's and keeping in touch with friends. I think im in the stage of depression when it comes to the stages of grief. So that's positive. Can't wait for the full acceptance stage and feeling okay again. Is it simply a waiting game?

It's such a mindfuck how this came about. My family is shook. Her family is shook. 'Our' friends are shook.

Also I'm friends with her brother. He is autistic so we don't talk about relationships or girls in general. We just chill and drink beer together. 

Also a thing: her mom texts me regularly. Asking how I'm doing, how uni is, vacation plans, she sends me pictures of her vacation now (a pic of a beer shop and said she thought of me), and asks me to grab a coffee with her before going on my vacation. It's sweet but it also feels a little bit like she is compensating for the behaviour of my ex.",3,1750356238.0,FTMMen,0,1.0,False

1lfhjov,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/1lfhjov/birth_control_causing_gerd_vestibular_issues/,Birth Control Causing GERD & Vestibular Issues?,"About three months ago, I switched from my regular birth control pill to one with higher levels of hormones to help regulate my period. If I missed one day of my original pill, I could start my period even though it might be only a week and a half into my 3-week pill cycle. My OB said that my body has just changed due to having a couple of kids. 

Before switching birth control types, I was having a few spells of dizziness that would go away after sitting or laying down for a few minutes. Those would happen maybe every few days. After I switched birth control, I haven't had those strong spells of dizziness, but have had more regular feelings of dizziness, with a lower intensity, but sometimes for hours or even most of the day. I've also had pressure in my ears (primarily my left) along with some pain in my ears and some milder tension-type headaches.

Within a few days of switching birth control, I also started having digestive issues, and within a couple of weeks started having acid reflux. With acid reflux, it doesn't seem to matter what I eat. I haven't had alcohol in months now and have only had coffee a few times.

I only started to realize that maybe at least the acid reflux and digestive issues could be linked with the birth control change, so a month ago, I switched back to my old birth control. I'm still having bad acid reflux, and I've been taking omeprazole 20 mg every day along with probiotics for the last six weeks. 

I know that it takes a while for hormone levels to even out, but I'm thinking about going completely off birth control for at least a few months to see if at least the acid reflux will go away, and my gut can heal. After that, maybe trying again or looking into the copper IUD. 

  
I have also had blood tests and a CT scan on my stomach with everything being normal. I had an MRI of my brain that came back showing a ""benign-looking pineal cyst of 1.3 cm"". 

I'm freaking out a little here about the pineal cyst, but I'm really hoping that everything (the acid reflux, digestive problems, dizziness, ear pressure/pain, headaches, and some cramping/soreness in my calves) are all connected to the birth control changes. I have another appointment next week with my primary care doctor, but most of the experiences I've read about online have doctors who don't take the link with birth control or the link with the pineal cyst seriously, so I'm worried. 

Does anyone else have any experience with birth control causing these symptoms? If so, what helped for you? How long did it take for your symptoms to go away after taking birth control? ",1,1750356133.0,birthcontrol,1,1.0,False

Rating: Mature

Story Summary: Dancing at The Gilded Cage was Aziraphale’s dream job. When the lights dimmed and the music started, it was as if a switch flipped. His body reacted to the beat, and instantly he was someone else. Not a stuffy bookseller, not a stodgy tea drinker. Suddenly, he was a sexy cage dancer, and he felt that power.

Aziraphale met Crowley two weeks after he began dancing at the club. At first Crowley was just another admirer. Then it seemed possible he might become something more. But Crowley was a player who went home with a different woman every night, and Aziraphale was an asexual gay man. No matter how strong their attraction, there was no way this could work.

Unless, just maybe, it could.


Chapter Summary: It had been a week since Crowley had been to The Gilded Cage. A week since he had sat at the bar and decidedly not asked Aziraphale out on a date. Now, as Aziraphale sat in the dressing room after his shift, he couldn’t help but wonder if he had made a huge mistake agreeing to go to coffee with him. He didn’t want to be friends with Crowley. He wanted something more.

Chilean Route 7 is an iconic bikepacking pilgrammage, funneling hundreds of globetrotting cyclists each year into its jagged swan dive towards the Antarctic Islands of Tierra del Fuego.
 
More steep gravel switchbacks and loathsome ripios. More frantic marathons between tight ferry connections. Bucolic harbor towns idling in the steam of hot morning coffee and the trumpeting foghorn of imminent departures. Falling asleep on the boat’s steel cargo deck floor, an exhausted heap puddled beneath my own bike. Waves lapping at my shoes. Gently rocked between dreams by the motor’s calming troll.

Repotted them as soon as I got home because they had roots busting out of the bottoms of their pots and I used a generic house plant mix and put them in the spot I found my Pilea likes best for sunlight levels (she was originally struggling with our usual window sill that has a bit more sun light so now she's in the same room but on a coffee table away from the window and is shadily pointing all her leaves aggressively at the window but has been doing a lot better since the move so I think it's for the best).

Would like to know what they are and if anyone has any tips to helping them thrive. The one with the larger arrow head shaped leaves seems happy, he's produced 2 new leaves but he looks a little anemic compared to my other plants and some of his newer leaves, and the smaller leafed plant just hasn't changed much at all.

1lfhfyd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfhfyd,AIO on thinking my roommate is odd?,"I (29F) live in a NYC apartment with three roommates. One of them (42M) has always kind of rubbed me the wrong way.

The first day we met, he ranted about his ex/the mother of his child . He said she takes him to court because “she still wants him.” It immediately gave me the ick. But over the months, I kinda got used to him.

But then other things started happening. One day, we passed in the kitchen and said a quick “hey.” Moments later, he started peeing with the bathroom door open and only closed it a few seconds later. It was so weird and gross I later told myself I must’ve imagined it. 

He makes coffee every morning and would offer me some. I sent thank-you texts, and he started ending his texts with, “luv” to me. He also said I seemed “quiet but kind.” Another time as he was walking back to his room, he paused, flicked his hair back dramatically, and gave me a long, sultry look. I smiled politely and chose to ignore it.

He also vents about women to me, including his ex and how hard it is to date in NYC because he doesn’t have money. I don’t ask, he just unloads. He said something like “people always ask me why I’m not dating, and  I’m like look - no woman in this city would want to date someone like me.”

One week, I hadn’t seen him in a while and another roommate said they were worried he was depressed. So I texted him, see attached texts. He replied he was thinking about me too, which rubbed me the wrong way.

When he returned, he fist-bumped me in front of another roommate and I felt awkward bc I didn't want anyone thinking we were closer than we are.

Then he asked me on a date, see attached texts.

Another time, he texted me asking if I could grab his package. But it bothered me that he messaged me personally instead of using the group chat because I don’t want there to be an expectation that he can rely on me solely - if that makes sense. See texts attached.

For some reason, that exchange irritated me because he was the one who could not handle directness but made it seem as I could not. 

Final instance/last straw, he tried to touch my shoulder while we were talking and I instinctively pulled away.

I've been on this subreddit before but not much luck. Unfortunately most messages have about as much substance as the people behind them. I'm looking for long term friends and actual connections but I know that's a bit of a loaded request on here. I'm hoping we have things in common to talk about. A bit about me is I'm quite introverted. I enjoy a lot of quiet, creative hobbies like reading and journaling. I like old sitcoms and cartoons, I'm not huge on anime but I do read a few mangas. A quiet and slower lifestyle. I love visiting libraries, coffee shops, bookstores, thrift stores. It's a bit hard to find others like me because they're usually all hiding the same. I do love spending time with someone while just doing our own things, the company is very nice. I'll match your energy when it comes to messaging, I love to chat but I am shy at first. I'm pretty easy going but I am a bit of an old lady compared to most. I hope you know how to carry a conversation or show interest in it. If you're looking for a short conversation, I probably won't be a fun chat. Something a bit different to my other hobbies is I love paranormal and supernatural topics. I have some pretty odd, spiritual beliefs before we get to the conversation. I enjoy some video games but not huge on it. I love COD zombies, RDR2, Minecraft, The Sims, Infinity Nikki, and some others. I hope your message is a bit more than just a hi, hello. I'm 27 from Cali, open to anyone but keep it sfw. It would be great to make some girl friends, I hope I can find other women looking for genuine friends. It would be great if you're within a 6-8 hr time difference so its not so difficult but if we can make good friends, I'm sure we can make it work!

Here are some icebreakers:

* Do you believe in anything paranormal or supernatural?

I’m about to buy my first *ever* robot vacuum cleaner and could really use your advice.

I just moved into my first own flat in the south of Germany. I’ve seen a few of these robot cleaners in action at friends’ places (with names like *Clean Elizabeth*, which I love), and now I’m ready to get one myself.

I started diving into the topic today with some help from AI and YouTube. I even discovered “Vacuum Wars” through this subred. But still, I’d love to hear from actual users who’ve been through this before.

Here’s my situation:

* **Flat size:** 60 m²
* **Surfaces:** Mostly laminate + some tile (bathroom + small hallway)
* **Rugs:** One larger in the living room, one smaller under the coffee table
* **Pets:** None
* **Price range:** Ideally under €500, but I’m flexible if there’s great value for a higher priced one
* **Flexibility:** I will move a lot in the coming years, thus a versatile robo cleaner would be nice

**What I want:**  
A vacuum robot *with a mop function*, good cleaning, easy maintenance, and a smart base would be nice and I’m more interested in price-to-value than paying a premium for brand names.

With that in mind, I’ve narrowed it down to these models based on what I found through AI, reviews, and comparison videos:

* Xiaomi X20+
* Dreame L10s Ultra Gen 2
* Roborock Q Revo
* Ecovacs Deebot T50 Pro Omni
* Roborock S8

So here’s my question to you all:

Are these models actually solid picks for my needs or are there any you'd immediately rule out (and why)?  
Also: Am I missing a better option within my budget that I should definitely consider?

Bonus: I have an AI-generated list with suggestions, which I can share if useful.

Thanks in advance! Really appreciate any tips, warnings, or personal experiences. Hope you're having a good day. Enjoy the sun if you've got it, and if not, at least enjoy the clean floors you don’t have to mop yourself.

1lfhdkp,https://i.redd.it/emghnnr9ax7f1.jpeg,Is there romantic potential between us?,"L7 has reached out to me to reconnect after years apart (living in different countries, we briefly dated before I left). I cast this chart on June 2nd - 4 days after I met him for coffee  and I realised the sparks were flying and I am in fact keen to see this man more. Due to me being very cautions, and residing in another town, I tried to take it very carefully, but since then I found a job in the same city and I want to pursue this relationship further. Now, for context, I thought he’d reach out to me at some point during this month, but he didn’t (understandable, he went on a 10 day holiday) and I didn’t either as I needed to process my feelings and focus on job/apartment search. 

Fast forward I find myself pondering how to proceed and analysing this chart to figure out if this has some strong potential. I am very slow when it comes to pursuing romance.

My take: L7 and sun both in a Mercury ruled sign - signifying that he is in fact interested in me as a person and as a woman. I take the sun-mercury 4 degree separation as our coffee meet-up and I notice that Venus makes an applying sextile to Jupiter at 2 degrees. The moon has went on to square all the planets in Gemini (that’s probably me overthinking every aspect of this eh?), but furthermore, Jupiter was in the last degrees of Gemini, about to change signs to where he is exalted, would that signify a diminishing interest, or is he still keen considering that now it’s in Moons domicile? I’m puzzled why he hasn’t reached out to me so far and whether he’ll respond positively to my advances. If I’m correct in my interpretation, the Mercury (L1) being the sole dispositor of all these planets would mean everything’s in my hands and I understand it’s the faster moving planet, meaning it’ll be the one having to take initiative. Would there have to be stronger, uninterupted mutual aspects that would signify things progressing?",1,1750355739.0,horary,2,1.0,False

☕[Tip Jar](http://buymeacoffee.com/oldbublysoul29) I enjoy doing these weekly posts & hope that others have found them to be resourceful. If you would like to toss a coin or two (thanks in advance!!), I’ve set up a Buy Me a Coffee page. Never expected, always appreciated ❣️ (P.S. if you’re having trouble getting to the “checkout” page, you might need to turn off content blockers on your phone.)",4,1750355689.0,Minneapolis,1,0.83,False
1lfhcaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lfhcaz/aitah_for_making_a_group_chat_behind_a_friends/,AITAH for making a group chat behind a friend’s back.,"I actually have a few good friends or best friends.We are a group 6.It’s all female.We have a lot of extended friends too.I have this friend,let’s call her Shelby.We actually made a group chat behind her back.

Okay so the story started when our exam results were about to be published last year (We are still in school).During the exam period,we were still on good terms.So Me and one of my other friends let’s call them Kate and Missy.We actually told Shelby after Physics and Chemistry exams specifically me and Kate that our exams went bad.We might not get A’s.In my country we have this gpa system where the highest is 5.00.We also told her that even if we do get A’s in those particular subjects we will barely them.My physics exam truthfully didn’t went good.It wasn’t what I expected.And for Missy she just never gave a proper response that could tell us if her exams went bad or good.And For my other two friends let’s call them Nina and Bella.They also said quite the same thing as us.


Time skip after exams.Things were going well.We were chatting in our groups.We even went to this event together and had lots of fun.So SHELBY’S mom actually told Kate’s mom that “you know yeah my daughter did told me that Kate and Alina’s  (Me) exam went bad.I don’t really trust that.You’ll see at the end of the day my daughter will bad grades and these two will get good grades.That’s why I tell her not to trust her friends that much.” Even in or chats Shelby mentioned a lot of times that her mom didn’t want us to get gpa 5 only and what not.She was like if we’re not getting gpa 5 then I hope yall are also not getting it or else I’ll riot.Shelby actually told us her exams went good so we naturally thought that she would get gpa 5 and assured her “Bestie you got this dw.We believe in you” We were actually very genuine while saying these stuffs.

We actually got our exam results through a secret link before the official date.Me,Missy and Kate we all got gpa 5.Shelby and Nina didn’t.For some reason bella couldn’t use that link so we didn’t know her result.This is when things started getting weirder and weirder.Shelby threw a tantrum on us.She kept crying and crying.Her mom was tormenting her mentally.Scolding her and then insulting us for not getting a gpa 5.Okay Nina actually gave us the link and told us not to tell this to anyone.Shelby immediately send it to our school’s public chat.Nina then confronted her and she shrugged it off saying everyone deserved to know this.Shelby was straight up rude while saying this.Nina just didn’t bother anymore she was already enough upset about ger own result.But she was afraid that if people find out she was behind the link,she’ll get in trouble with the teachers.ANYWAYS,Shelby’s mom went to our school before the official result date and demanded that the teachers show her Shelby’s exam papers and recheck it.Because there’s been a mistake.Shelby deserves gpa 5.Our school teacher also kinda insulted her because she demanded this even before our school’s official result.

When Shelby told us this over the group chat Nina was furious.Because she might get in trouble with the teachers.So she confronted Shelby.We took Nina’s side.Shelby made a scene that she was going through a lot.That we didn’t knew what’s going on in her house.Then straight up lied saying she didn’t knew Nina was behind the link.

Okay the official result day.Things were going normal.She was upset naturally we comforted her.We went to the stage to receive our results from the principal.But remember how I said we didn’t knew if Bella got an gpa 5 or not? Well she had gotten gpa 5,That’s when Shelby broke down in tears and cried hysterically.We immediately rushed there to comfort her.After a while,her mom came,she was basically afraid of her mom.She was hiding behind us.But her mom forcefully grabbed her wrist then started saying this in front of her in a mocking tone “Go ahead.Trust your friends more.This is what’ll happen to you.You’ll always fall behind.” (How is this our fault that she didn’t got gpa 5)

Anyways her mom insulted my mom with these same things.My mom didn’t say anything and just said if she wanted to grab coffee with her.When we went home,Shelby’s mom called Nina,”See you two are dumbasses.Your other friends are doing well.You two are falling behind.So you shouldn’t share anything with them only share it with my daughter.”She went on and on over the same thing about.Calling us traitors and liars.Even Shelby messaged Nina personally and said the same things.Shelby even said Bella didn’t deserve the gpa 5.I will see what’s written on her exam papers.Ik she didn’t derive this.Shelby’s mom said my mom talked with in arrogance because I got gpa 5 and Shelby didn’t.


After that we kinda made a new group chat without her.We eventually confronted her about all her wrong doings and wanted to cut her off.But she said that “Please don’t leave me for this.I really have no one beside y’all.Don’t cut me off please please I beg you.” We felt bad like really bad so we’re still friends with her.Yeah but we’re genuine about the friendship.But still can’t move past the few facts.
Side note:She always does victim blaming,Bitches about one of our friends to other one,thinks she’s the leader of the group and we have to follow her always.I couldn’t even invite one of my friends to a event for her because she didn’t like her and threw a tantrum about it saying if I invite her she’s gonna ignore her and what not.This is it.We’re still friends ",1,1750355652.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

1lfhaob,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNSUBSCRIBEpodcast/comments/1lfhaob/thin_blue_line_appreciation_post/,Thin Blue Line Appreciation Post,"Hi! 

This is be raw and little rough but stick with me, if you don't mind. 

I am a single mother of 2. My oldest daughter,  unfortunately lost her father due self harm after the Army; which is why I try always comment something positive when I see anyone post about being in a bad mental place. I wish I had known the signs before it was too late, but all we can do now is try help those left here still. But I haven't always been good at explaining  it as it hurts still for us both. I need to do better for my baby, I am working with her therapist to fix this issue. So please don't come for me, I am trying my best. My youngest daughter is also his child but she was only a few months old at is now 2 so she's not asked questions, yet. 



Today is my oldest daughter 8th birthday. 8 years if blessing and joy. Today our husky got off leash in our front yard and someone called the cops. Which is their right so no hard feelings. Our dog is 12, I got him when my their dad  was stationed overseas and he was our first baby. So 2 years ago when he was diagnosed with cancer, I moved us all to a small town so he could have a yard and freedom before it's too late. 

The cop asked what was going on with one his tumors, and I explained that after losing my job 14 months ago I have been living on savings and 401ks. And I was at the point I can't afford the treatment but I was cleaning it and keeping him pain free at home as long as I can, I know the end is coming but not today. Not just my baby's 8th birthday, but I am selfishly not ready to say goodbye again to my should have been husband or even our first baby. I know how fucked that makes me, and I hate I feel this way but I have cried and held that dog so many nights alone while my babies slept peacefully. I couldn't have made it thru that without my fur-boy. 

Well after explaining this to this officer. He said okay and left. I thought it was good and done. This amazing man, came back with a cake, gifts for my 8 year old, diapers, wipes, and dog treats/ medications from the vet I couldn't get.  He also unknowingly, when he handed me the mail that had just been dropped off, but I had a letter of a work from home Job offer. So I am finally going back to work, so that's amazing. 

So beyond just being such a wonderful human and helping me save the last 275 in my bank account by getting those items I was about to leave to pick up with my last bit of cash. But he also handed me, my golden ticket to be back on track. He might not have had anything to do with it, but it was all at once so it's worth talking about. 

  
This is police work, we NEED this being on media. We need the Richard's that rise flags when its fucked up, and we need T. Derke's that see a situation that isn't gonna cause anyone bat an eye lash but he choose to do above and beyond because he saw it was needed. These are the cops we need in the media. These are the cops we need show our kids, so they know the news is only sharing what gets views, not what matters. 

  
Thank you to T. Derke, while those things to me are life changing , most wouldn't have thought these little things would be so meaningful. But to me, they are priceless reminders that good is still here and we have to keep it alive. It's wonderful men and women everyday willing to lay their own lives down so they can have a chance to have these little moments, and that on its own is reason to respect and always be good to those in uniforms. 



I never asked for anything, I just answered his questions honestly. And he took that information and ran with the ball in a way I never would have expected or even asked for as there are others who need it more. BUT as a mother who was biting nails trying figure it all out, you just made such a difference in my life with those little things that I will be able to hold on to everything until my first pay day. That's lights and water I wasn't sure how I was cover but now I don't have pick 

  
Thank you to Officer T. Derke of Mayflower, AR for not only just doing such a hard job, but thank you for your kindness and service. I have coffee and cake anytime you need a free pick me up. Just come on by! 

  
Also THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOU THAT ALSO HAVE TAKEN THESE OATHS AND CARRY THEM OUT AS WELL AS YOU ALL DO. I know ya'll hate it when people say that but damnit this one time take it because this is this needed. 

  
Everyone have a great day and remember that little things make the most difference sometimes! 



P.S. My 8 year old always wanted to be k-9 like her dad was  in the army, and I got the chance to show her that if this is what she wants to do then this is how it can effect people, she's never wanted to be police more! I couldn't be prouder.  And so is her daddy in heaven. Just thank you officer T. Derke! I pray this goes virial so it gets  the attention to shed a much needed positive light on our law enforcement. Plus I just want to see you get the praise you deserve. 

God bless everyone in those uniforms. ",1,1750355547.0,UNSUBSCRIBEpodcast,0,0.66,False

1lfh9vp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfh9vp,Week 24 Cream scones,"Okay, this one has a story.  I made the recipe exactly as written,  including the currants (which I happen to love, great on oatmeal!), up to the baking part, and then I had to get creative because my oven is out of commission.  It’s also hot outside and in, so maybe creative wasn’t a bad thing.  I considered the alternatives available (I have previously resorted to baking on my grill) and remembered that my Instant Pot with the air-fryer lid has baking capabilities- I think I made a cheesecake once just to try it out.  So that’s what I used, in the 7 1/2” pan I used for the cheesecake.  I baked half at a time, keeping the others in the freezer.  I determined they were done less by color than by temping them with a thermometer and I had to adjust the baking temperature but probably would have been fine sticking to 375.  They came out fine - great for the really minimal effort required.  I don’t think I have ever made a scone with no butter before.  I have spent about a year of my life in the U.K. and I have eaten a lot of scones (I’ve made more than a few too, both traditional and non-).  I think these are about middle of the pack.  The unorthodox baking technique gave them a crispier outside than is traditional (scones are often pretty pale in England), but that suits my American palate just fine.  As easy as this was, and without heating the house up at all, I would do it again!  I might try the coffee cake recipe (scaled down) the same way since I am waiting for a part for the oven, and heat waves are here!  ",4,1750355493.0,BakingSchoolBakeAlong,0,1.0,False
1lfh9jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lfh9jg/got_dumped_and_it_still_doesnt_feel_real/,Got dumped and it still doesn't feel real,"My girlfriend (20f) of almost one year broke up with me (20f). Our 1yr mark would've been in 5 days from today. I broke no contact after 1 day of not talking, which I don't regret because I really needed to hear from her that her decision was final. I kept waking up thinking she was besides me and hyperventilating, I haven't ate in a while, and I keep throwing up and shaking. I am an Anxious Attachment person so this all makes sense for me unfortch. We have had minor breakups before but always reconciled. Our biggest arguments were mostly about going out to bars and me wanting her to move in with me for the summer. Basically, she didn't want to move in with me, because she wanted to be home which is an hour and a half from her. I was stubborn at first but I came around eventually and never made a deal out of it. We also extensively argued about how much she always glazes her friends. Although she did her best to put me above her friends, I never wanted her to do that just because I wanted it. I just wish she had the love for me to do it naturally like I did. 

All of these arguments were my fault, but I only brought them up because she is not confrontational and still struggles communicating clearly. Last week, she came to visit and everything was alright. We had a lot of fun but still a few hiccups and one argument that kept us up all night with me sleeping on the floor until we reconciled. She always does her best to reconcile and I admit I can be petty and sensitive. But she is just as sensitive too, which is why she doesn't do well with confrontation. On the last night we had together, which was last Wednesday, I read her journal with her permission after peer pressuring her to let me read it, and found a bunch of mean stuff about me. She said stuff like ""she's a big baby"" or ""She has no friends"" and that's why I am apparently always bothering her, ""When will this relationship ever end"" (this was around 5-7 month mark), and all her entries usually started with ""lets get the bad stuff out of the way"" and it would be about me. The good stuff would be her friends that she hardly hangs out with because they hardly make the effort to see her or something she is looking forward to unrelated to me. The last entry was on May 1, when she came to visit me at school. We are long distance and actually met long distance so we occasionally try to visit each other once a month. I had some really exciting news that I was telling her about as she was boarding her plane, and overall she seemed very excited to see me via text. Well, in that entry she wrote while on the plane, it was all bad stuff about me, not one single ounce of excitement about seeing me, and then she wrote about how she looks forward to possibly repeating a trip she made last summer with a friend. I was invited to this trip last time I knew of it, but I guess now I was out of the picture, otherwise she would've mentioned it. The part that splintered me was about her formal. 

Basically, I have really traumatic experiences from dating people that would go out because I have been cheated on, and most people I have talked to about this insecurity have said it's valid because going out is a very prominent aspect of ""single"" culture. I know I'll get dogged on this but that was the ONLY boundary I wanted in our relationship and she constantly invalidated it and tried to break it. I know couples who had no issue with the same boundary I asked for. I didn't think it should be that serious of a compromise for her since she said she would make me feel validated months before but then she felt left out because all her friends in her college organization were doing it and she felt lonely. Anyways, yes, she goes to formal which is the first time she has gone out in a while and I am super comfortable because she promised to keep me updated and that I wouldn't have to worry about a thing. Throughout the night, however, I had this suspicion that she was drunk because of the way she was texting, and she had said she wouldn't drink? Well, when I read her journal she said she had gotten drunk but honestly ""couldn't care less about telling"" me. And that is when I felt myself go ""I don't think she has ever cared about being open with me."" To be fair, whenever she is open sometimes I criticize her or get mad, so she was scared of upsetting me. But I would've much rather been upset for a short time than been upset for a long time, not because she drank but because she doesn't feel like being open with me. 

Since our two-month mark, small arguments had given her intrusive thoughts to break-up with me except it wasn't even an argument (according to what she wrote), it was a misunderstanding that I brought up patiently and kindly. It seems I have gone rotten because I got overwhelmed with wanting more from her while she wanted less from me. Throughout the rest of the months, small arguments would lead her to breaking down and resorting to wanting to break up. I always told her I'd get better and incrementally I did, but she didn't sense that from me. Promises included me being less snarky to her, giving her space because she didn't want to call every single night, and for her to communicate with me whenever there was something, regardless of whether I'd get upset or not. The space thing is something I wish I could go back and change. Had I actually respected her wish for space on some nights to let her be with herself or study or whatever, I could've also used the time to reflect on all the good moments in our relationship and allowed her to miss me. Instead, I kept ignoring that boundary because I felt very lonely during the school year, and I felt myself further wrapped up in this crusade to microanalyze all her small mistakes and spiral over the idea that she didn't love me. 

Anyways, when I read her journal in front of her she was very sad and tried to comfort me, saying those things she wrote (consistently) about me for months were just during moments where she felt really overwhelmed and didn't know where else to spill it. I do appreciate her confining it to a notebook, but the glaring issue for me was the lack of communication from her. I know I too am in the wrong for reading her journal, but the larger issue at hand is the fact that hadn't I done that, she would've never communicated those things. Ever. About all these feelings. She said she would make it better and even go inactive in her organization in order to save this relationship with me, since I had very little trust in her from that point on, and the next morning she had to go back home so we got coffee, dropped me off at work, and drove home. She said she thought of me to some song on the way home, and that she missed me and etc. It felt very refreshing to hear those things because it hasn't felt like that in a while. Her missing me, I mean. 

Friday, Saturday, Sunday were all chill days but we argued about the dang journal again because I brought it up, and she said she didn't want to be in the relationship anymore if I kept bringing it up because she was just so exhausted about it and she kept beating herself up for writing those things. It didn't help that I too was beating her down for those things. So I said OK, I won't bring it up anymore. However, on monday, after hanging out on facetime and watching adventure time, I made a snarky comment about how she probably danced while she was drunk and she looked me dead in the eye and went I CANT DO THIS. She has done this before but she has always cried while doing it. This time, she didn't shed a single tear. It felt eerie. Prior to this, we have reflected about all her previous attempts to break up with me and she said that she was happy they never went through because I always found a way to make her feel better and mend things. She also said I had made good progress after reconciling. But this time there was no convincing her otherwise. She said she has felt trapped, overwhelmed, exhausted, and tired and that she doesn't even know who she is. I asked her if she would ever get in another relationship and she said she doesn't want a relationship, period. She feels lost and doesn't know what she's about anymore, and that this relationship has done a lot of work on her and she is finally drawing the line. 

I need to respect her decision and give her space, but it is indefinite space which scares me. I suggested that I'd be willing to stay together and do one week of no contact just for the sake of reflection, but she said nope. She says that I have betrayed her trust, not necessarily the journal thing, but the fact that I told her I'd get better after every attempt to break up and she feels like I have lied and been incapable of that. She doesn't trust me to even give her space. I get it. I'm her first girlfriend and I've been with other women before in the past and never felt this shattered. I truly had faith in her, as I met her during a time period where I was done with love entirely. She begged for me to give her a chance and so I did. I begged her to give me a final chance on Monday when she broke up with me, and she just couldn't because she felt defeated and worn down. I too felt worn down when she met me but maybe this is too defensive. I only highlight all the bad stuff because it has led to this break up, but we had a lot of cool epic moments. We never had a dull time when we were physically together and even on calls we would be hilarious. Unfortunately, none of those moments were ever written about in her journal. We saw Christmas in Chicago and ice skated and did all the touristy things that we have talked about doing for months and it is such a high for the two of us, but she also never wrote about it. I keep telling myself maybe she will come around after a period of space and think about all the good things we did. 

I like to tell myself maybe she is just overwhelmed since the past week has been a really rough patch for us and she is very easy to give up on things. The truth is, however, that while at the beginning she liked making future plans and counting down the days until meeting again, I felt her dull down and avoid future talks and doing count downs. She seemed overwhelmed about her friend situation at school, but it didn't help that I was attached to her. I think I made her feel loved when she needed it because her friends couldn't be there for her, but she didn't necessarily want to reciprocate that. I promise I am not a bad lover, I just have an insecurity with going out and I can be anxiously attached, but from what it feels like maybe me and her were just incompatible. She likes spending time with herself while I don't like looking inward that much. I have wanted a lover for a long time and this is her first relationship. Her mom controls her a lot, and she tells her mom so many bad things about me that it's impossible to feel good about myself. Her mom controls her finances and has discouraged her from getting a job up until her 3rd year at university, when she finally realized almost everyone virtually has a job since it's good for experience. She is an introvert and can be awkward in public unless she is with her organization peeps. And also, her uni is 1.5 hour drive from home, while I am entirely out of state. She made excuses about wanting to go home during school breaks instead of visiting me and it always baffled me because she could easily go home for a weekend. On the other hand, I traveled a lot in the past and have had a lot of crazy experiences, I am very outgoing (except for right now because I am in shambles), and extroverted. I've had many horrible experiences with dating that I have confronted and moved past from but still haunt me, but I will say those were relationships that lasted for less than 5 months and it wasn't my fault. This time, I really messed up not giving my girl space. I have ambitions in life to go to grad school and become a professor and I invest in stocks and yada yada. I come from a low income background so I am trying really hard to get myself out the mud and be successful. I work a lot just to buy her nice things and before she broke up with me I ordered her this expensive print that will be arriving at her house sometime during this awful period. She doesn't really have a clear idea of what her future should be, and every time I'd talk about potential travel with her or making some sort of plan, she would push it aside and say it makes her anxious to think about the future in general. She also says her mom wouldn't let her and then says it's not because she hates me. However, it doesn't make her anxious to think about the future with her friends. This is definitely a me-problem. 

As much as I don't want to be with someone who treats me like a ""maybe"" and doesn't want to dream with me, I miss her so much y'all. I could've broken up with her a long time ago because I also felt trapped in this cycle of constantly asking her to do things like hold my hand or be more enthusiastic about spending time together, but I thought maybe it would get better. I wanted us to grow and it never crossed my mind that I wanted to leave her. She is one of a kind. She is blonde with the prettiest eyes, she makes incredible art and is very sweet and I love her quietness and how intelligent she is. We both are good writers and review each others papers which saves me so much time from visiting the writing center lol. We have the exact same interest in sports and culture, we like to play basketball together and baseball. We love watching sports a lot and we talk about jerseys and cool merch to get. She is whimsical and has an impeccable music taste. She feels like a quieter version of me. She would never cheat, she is not the kind to as she can hardly flirt. She is my dream girl, or at least the closest version of her, and we were legit two perfect strangers that met from very far away without dating apps or any of that. It was truly magical. The relationship was toxic in its own aspects such that I pushed a lot of friends of mine away because of how in love I was with her, and during this period of space I have been rekindling those connections. Most people say that it's okay that that happened because clearly I was overwhelmed trying to convince myself that she loved me and that me begging her to be more outwardly loving with me also took a toll on me. Both her and I were overwhelmed, just had different ways of expressing that. She asked for space, and I asked for more attention. It's just really hard to move past those moments and most times she has broken up with me she has said she did it in the heat of the moment and looking back she never meant to. This makes it really hard to grapple with this actual break up now, as my mind is very chaotic and analytical, thinking maybe she will come around. Some people have said with enough space, she will come back around. I don't like keeping exes as friends but she genuinely shares intellect that I could never find in someone else. Feels like a piece of my own mind. I'd like to be friends with her and keep in touch, obvi not right now because I also need space to cope and move on. But I'd like to communicate that at some point. 

I'll be going home in a week and a half and would like to have my stuff back as some of it is fragile, and once I am home I will be too far away from her to make the drive. but she hasn't been the one to initiate that convo unless its me. And I don't wanna text her. Is she holding on to the things because she is afraid to confront them for the good mems they carry? Or does she not care and she's just waiting for me to be ready about getting my things back? She said she felt numb last time we talked, and just yesterday she took off the matching pfps on insta and took down anything with me in it. But no unfollow, and she was fine keeping our tik tok streak. We just text a period lol. I know this can't be easy for her, and my friend said that if all that awaited the break up was a snarky comment, then I shouldn't be with someone who is that easy to give up. I agree. Doesn't make me miss her less, but it does make me feel a little better about being so clingy. I just want to be with someone who loves me more than I love them, and I had felt that during the first 2-3 months of our relationship, but stuff waned rather quickly. She has rly bad anxiety problems and I have been struggling with severe depression for almost two years. We made good friends but frankly, we didn't make good lovers. She is so good at cuddling but our chemistry in bed was low, and we were both very whimsical when we spent time together. What can I do/hope for besides giving her space? What is a good way to distract? I am staying in her college city this summer because of an internship I can't quit, and going out stresses me out a lot. I am constantly aware of my surroundings and afraid to see one of her mutuals. I tried to eat in public bcs my friend didn't want to go eat it at the apt, so we ate at the place and a song of ours started playing and I felt like barfing. Please help, I want to eat and distract myself without constantly needing to be on the phone with someone, I just don't know what to do. I wonder if she still cares about me or if it has hit her that people like us don't always come across one another. 

I am capable of fixing my anxious attachment and stuff but I also don't want to be with someone who feels comfortable lying. I can't get myself to get our playlists out of spotify and she be listening to music like it's just a casual day for her. Has she moved on? Is she just numb and waiting for it to hit? Or is she numb and eventually going to be happier moving on. Everyone has said I was a good girlfriend and that they wish they had someone like me because she hardly made the effort to be with me sometimes, and I wonder if maybe when she is older and has had a fair share of relationships she will reflect on my efforts and constant affection for her.  She helped me grow so much in terms of my passions for the future but I don't think she felt the same growth in herself. Our main goal in this relationship was to grow alongside one another and I don't think she got her share of that. She is likely in a very deep period of re-evaluation in general, and sure I'd be salty if she went somewhere far this summer knowing how many excuses she would've made it if was OUR trip. My mood keeps ebbing and flowing I can't help it. I know that if it's meant to be she will come back at some point in life. And many of my exes, even the cheating ones, have came back after I moved on. Should I reach out about getting my stuff back next week, which is unfortunately when our anniversary would've been? I am Catholic but can any of y'all tarot people wish she reaches out or something haha... Please help I need all the advice I can get. I really think she is my person but the timing in our lives was bad. And I don't want any negative stuff between us, I want us to be friends one day and consolidate things.

I put my life on hold to help him when he was going through things.  Getting kicked out, staying in shitty situations, having to take care of a sick animal etc. I stayed with him week after week for years to help out and be there for him. Now we live together and i am just lost and broken person. I got so comfortable just sitting around waiting for him to want to do things that i just stopped doing anything for myself. Stopped going out to even get coffee. I developed a bit of agoraphobia and now i feel trapped in my own head. 

I dont talk to anyone but his friends and thats rare now a days. I dont have any friends of my own and its so embarrassing. Im going to be 25 this year. 
 I dont talk to my family much anymore. I dont go outside, i dont do things for myself. I dont know what to do with myself everyday. I just sit here and cry realizing how much ive wasted trying to appease others. 

Before i met him i was in a very abusive relationship for 5+ years. I didnt have any friends (i was forced to cut them all off during hs)and  after that relationship and met someone through work who introduced me to my now partner. 
I no longer talk to that old coworker for unrealted reasons and i am so lonely  and isolated. Its my own fault, but now i am stuck and have no idea how to make friends.

How do i break this cycle of not living for myself and instead living for other people? I dont know where to start and im worried the longer it goes on the harder it will be to make friends and life my life. ",1,1750355447.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

We were together for eight months, and had spent almost every single day together. At the start, there were some signs of his insecurity. 

On the first night we met, we went out drinking and I told him all about my narcissistic ex boyfriend and how we broke up. Afterwards, he kissed me and we went back to his place. He then hugged me to sleep and refused to let me go home. 

I work in a job where there is networking after office hours. Two weeks into knowing each other, when I was out having drinks and work discussion at 1am, with a male colleague; I didn’t check my phone for an hour and when I came back to my phone there were seven missed calls and two text messages from him saying “I don’t like feeling like this” and “Have I done anything wrong ?”

Another time, when we were out drinking on a date, and I took my phone into the washroom. I was gone for maybe 15 minutes, when I came back to sit next to him at the bar, and admired at the mural in front of me, he suddenly went cold and asked “what’s wrong with you?” His sudden cold and aggressive demeanour struck me as off. I replied “nothing, just went to the bathroom”. He said “I know that you were on your phone texting” (which I wasn’t). I had only opened my WhatsApp to take a look at it and didn’t text. I then had to explain to him that I wasn’t messaging on my phone in the bathroom.

He had suffered trauma from his past relationships, - one ex girlfriend cheated on him and had a boyfriend the whole time, another ex girlfriend returned back to her ex after he asked her for a second chance. 

Besides his insecurity, which I felt that I could help reassure him in the long term and wouldn’t be an issue- he is a very loving and sweet boyfriend to me. He always did loving gestures for me, like making me coffee in the mornings, buying me flowers, opening doors for me, cooking for me, making sure I am comfortable etc.

However, we tend to get into arguments over the smallest things (that we can’t remember the next day) after we drink. Many times he has told me to leave his house at 2am, or that he wanted to end things. One time, I was upset by what he said and went to pack my bags. He immediately put on the calmest tone I’ve heard from him, and told me to stay. 

Two months into the relationship, he wanted me to go visit his parents over Christmas in his home country. Despite me thinking it was too early on, I eventually agreed to fly over. His parents were lovely but I noticed his family has a strong sense of distrust for people in general. On the trip, he trapped me into answering a question. We were talking about staying friends with our exes and he said he had blocked all of them. Then he said “you’re not going to like what I’ll say next, I know you are still contacting your ex.” Of course I was taken aback when he suddenly raised that up, so I said “yes, we do exchange texts but it’s infrequent (twice a week) and it’s not romantic at all”. He made me block my ex on all channels on that night. 

However, since my ex was abruptly blocked, he then tried to reach out to me a total of three times. Once, he contacted me from his work mobile, regarding the lock code for my bicycle (which I had left behind). I had simply replied my ex with the lock code which I then told my boyfriend that. My boyfriend was immediately upset, and said that it was my responsibility for blocking my ex from coming into our relationship. I could not comprehend how I can prevent my ex, from reaching out to me via another channel. He also mentioned that if my ex was to reach out again, we should report my ex to the police. 

The turning point came when my ex reached out to me for the third time. My ex had sent a message like “hey, not sure if I’m still blocked. You are my closest friend here, and I’d appreciate if we could have a chance to talk. I just lost my job two days ago”. My heart felt heavy when I received that text, and I felt even more repressed when I could not share it with my boyfriend immediately. I sat on it for one night. When I finally picked up my guts to tell my boyfriend the next morning, I started to cry when I mentioned that “my ex lost his job, can I send him a text?” In hindsight I was crying as I felt relieved I could finally share this news with him, after keeping it to myself overnight. However, I saw the look on his face had contorted, and he was really upset. He told me it was like a knife through his heart, and the image of me crying will forever be etched in his memory. I was panicking then as I could not convince him that I was already over my ex and that my crying had nothing to do with it. From that moment on, he became distant from me and told me he understood it could have been chalked down to miscommunication and a misunderstanding but he needed time to heal. 

He went back to his home country for a week. I asked him, if he wanted us to communicate since he wanted time to heal. He said yes, to keep messaging. When he left at the airport, he kissed me goodbye and told me that he loved me. 

However, he started becoming distant one day and didn’t reply to my text messages or was very curt, which was not his normal self. I asked to chat on the phone, and when he finally called me - he had a conversation with his parents about the issue with my ex reaching out to me. Apparently, they are now of the opinion that I was using my ex to terrorise and control my boyfriend and I was using my boyfriend for his money. This was all so abrupt and caught me off guard.

The context is, when I first met my boyfriend I had plans to buy a house soon, and as a result, my mom loaned me $140,000 for a downpayment which we agreed that I’d pay her back $8,000 a month, for 18 months. I had very early on given him a heads up about this - as I was aware that he is quite extravagant and spends a large sum of money on drinking and dining out (almost frivolously) as well as indulge in frequent holidays. I told him that we would need to dial back our lifestyle, otherwise I could also not participate so much, as I was not able to contribute enough but this would only be temporary. I even offered for him to move into my apartment and live with me, after 18 months, so that he could save on rent. He told me that it didn’t make sense if we dialed back our lifestyle, and that my payment of $8,000 was crippling - and that there was no point of him doing his lifestyle without me. He wanted me to pay less to my mother. While I am aware that he has been paying a lot more than me, I try to pick up the bill for some dinners and drinks twice a week, I buy him little presents to spruce up his house, and I treated his parents for two meals when they came to visit us. He started shouting that he was essentially paying off my house that I bought, and that I was living in his apartment and not paying him rent. When I asked him how much he wanted me to contribute, he said 50:50. 

My boyfriend was screaming on the phone and getting angrier by the minute, as nothing I said to make him understand that I did not do anything wrong seemed to fuel his anger. 

He then hung up on me and texted me that I was not allowed back into our home. He also texted that he would ship all of my items back to my mother’s home and that we would break up. He has also removed me from our friends group chat. 

This is a guy who was loving and happy with me, and then became suddenly aggressive and now thinks I’m a villain. This sudden switch, and his immense anger really shocked me. How can I get closure from this, as he is now ignoring my messages?

I wanted to share something a little personal – and a little creative. A few nights ago, I couldn’t sleep. You know those nights where your brain just won’t shut up? Where your thoughts are racing 100mph and your chest feels heavy, like it’s trying to hold in the whole world?

Instead of scrolling or spiraling, I grabbed my sketchbook and did something I hadn’t done in a while: I *drew my way back to the present.*

What came out of it was a 4-step illustrated grounding technique that’s been helping me *breathe, re-center, and slow the storm*. It’s simple, visual, and something I can now return to anytime things get overwhelming.

### The 4 Steps:

1. **Name 5 things you can see.**
   *(I drew a window, my coffee mug, a pen... objects I overlook every day)*
2. **Name 4 things you can touch.**
   *(I included textures – my sweater sleeve, a cool glass bottle, the floor under my feet)*
3. **Name 3 things you can hear.**
   *(Subtle stuff – a ticking clock, the hum of my computer, distant voices)*
4. **Name 2 things you can smell / 1 thing you can taste.**
   *(This one surprised me. I drew cinnamon and toothpaste. Funny how scent anchors us the fastest.)*

I added gentle colors, soft lines, and gave each step its own space – almost like a visual breathing room. I’ll admit: I made it for me. But maybe someone else needs it too. Maybe *you* do.

👉 I’d love to know – **does this resonate with you?**
Would you hang it up? Share it with a friend? Or maybe even suggest a tweak that makes it stronger?

I’ll take *any* feedback. I’m not a therapist, just a human trying to make sense of her head sometimes. But maybe this tiny illustration helps someone else feel just a little more grounded today.

Much love, and thank you in advance 🫶

About a month ago, I upgraded from the Profitec GO to the Profitec Move. Now I’m thinking it might be time to upgrade my grinder as well.

I’ve been using the Fiorenzato F4 Nano for the past 10 years. It’s been solid, but I make 3–4 coffees a day (usually 2 cappuccinos and 2 Americanos), and I feel like I could benefit from something more modern and better suited to my current setup.

I’m torn between two options:

* **Fiorenzato All Ground Sense**
* **Eureka Mignon Single Dose Pro**

To be honest, I’m leaning toward the All Ground Sense—I really like its design and features. But considering my daily routine and the fact that I usually single dose, the Eureka Mignon SD Pro might be the more practical choice.

Would like to hear your thoughts! Has anyone used both? Which one do you think fits better with my usage?

I’m putting myself through school, and am working towards getting my third degree. Because of this, I’m super broke and penny pinch in every way I can. My boyfriend is settled in his career with disposable income, so we have different habits when it comes to spending money (our finances are completely separate).
His birthday was last week, but I didn’t get him a physical gift because all of the things he really wants or needs are wildly outside my budget. Instead, I woke up super early in the morning to make him a big, special breakfast (french toast, eggs, bacon, and coffee), and brought it to him in bed.
He’s the type to work even on his birthday, so i also made him a special packed lunch (grilled chicken sandwich with pesto, mozzarella cheese, veggies, the works, and rice on the side). While he was at work, I cleaned his whole house. I swept, dusted, mopped, picked up, and organized. Then I made his favorite dinner (penne vodka) and organized a movie night of his all time favorites. When he got home, I gave him a handwritten happy birthday card before we ate dinner and watched the movies. 
I also planned a surprise party that weekend with his friends and family (which i also cleaned up everything after) and I thought he had a great time, but he admitted to me yesterday that he was upset and felt unimportant because i didn’t het him an actual present. 
I reminded him about my financial situation. He said it wasn’t about the cost of the gift, but the gesture behind giving something, and it could have been something small. I asked him if everything else I did wasn’t enough of a gesture, and he said that wasn’t the point. Now we’re both just upset at each other.

Hi all,
I (29F) went no-contact with my parents 3 years ago. My mom is the narcissist, my dad the enabler. I grew up in a home full of emotional manipulation, physical abuse, shame, and invalidation. I’ve been having intense flashbacks lately and it's been wrecking me emotionally.

Some of what I experienced:

My mom hit me in the eye as a child before a public function — I had to lie and say I fell.

She used fire to threaten me and once burned my ankle.

I was terrified to tell her I got my first period. I hid it for months and used cloth until she found out and beat me.

I lied about my marks once in 5th grade out of fear and was humiliated when they found out — I was still first in class.

As a 23-year-old, I was physically assaulted by my dad (egged on by my mom) and then paraded in front of his friends as if I was the one who needed fixing.

Every gift came with strings attached — nothing was unconditional, everything had guilt or control built into it.

I also realized over the years that my mom often seemed jealous of me.

She’d go through my personal things — skincare, makeup, journals — and then pretend it was no big deal.

If I bought something for myself or spent time taking care of my appearance, she’d make snide, passive-aggressive remarks or copy what I bought and hide it.

Once I bought some specialty coffee samples — she hid them from me because she paid for the exhibition entry. Months later, she sent a gift box with a huge coffee jar to guilt-trip me when I left home.

It was subtle, but consistent. She didn’t want me to have things she didn’t control. And if I showed joy or independence, she tried to dull it or claim it as her own.

I haven’t seen them in 3 years. I have a loving partner now. I thought I’d visit home on my dad’s 60th birthday — maybe try again — but I froze. I didn’t feel safe.

I sent a calm birthday message saying I was working through a lot emotionally. He replied with emotional blackmail, ignored my feelings, and spammed me with videos about how “parents are everything.” Eventually, I blocked him.

Four days later, he messaged me from another number:

""Will you even come visit us when we’re dead?""

My body shut down. I panicked and hid in the bathroom while my partner slept.
This is what happens every time I try to engage, even a little.

And still, part of me wonders:

Am I overreacting? What if they were right? What if I’m just an ungrateful daughter?

But the truth is — I never once felt safe enough to tell them when I was hurting. Not when I got dumped. Not when I was broke. Not when I was hungry. Not even now.

I’m trying to study for a major exam (CAT 2025) and build a life, but the flashbacks, guilt, and grief keep hitting me like waves.

Has anyone else had parents guilt-trip after going no contact?
How do you stay grounded when your trauma is screaming but the guilt keeps whispering ""maybe it wasn’t that bad""?",3,1750354587.0,narcissisticparents,1,1.0,False

Wakes up at noon because ""inspiration doesn't do mornings."" In their world, there are no alarm clocks, only self-imposed deadlines.

They are the designer, the marketer, the support team, and sometimes even the office cleaner. Their workspace is a cozy apartment where pajamas are the dress code, and coffee is the fuel for creativity.

Every bug is a personal affront and an opportunity for a new meme. Fixing errors isn't just work; it's an art form.

Releasing a game is like launching a rocket: thrilling, terrifying, and filled with hope that it won't explode on takeoff.

# Corporate Developer:

Wakes up at 7 AM because ""the workday starts at 9."" They are specialists in their field, with deep but narrow expertise.

The office dress code isn't just a shirt; it's part of the corporate culture. Coffee here is less about inspiration and more about staying alert.

Bugs are part of the workflow, discussed in meetings with serious faces and documented in reports. Fixing errors isn't an art; it's routine.

Releasing a product is a team effort, complete with reports, plans, and promises of improvements in the next sprint.

# Conclusion:

The indie developer is a superhero with many hats and an endless supply of creativity. They live in a world where every day is a new adventure.

The corporate developer is a master of their craft, working in a well-oiled team. They live in a world where every day is a step toward a common goal.

So, which one are you? Or perhaps you're corporate by day and indie by night?

1lfgux7,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1lfgux7/the_quickest_way_to_spot_a_scammer/,The quickest way to spot a scammer,"After reading the Nth ""yikes I was talking to a scammer"" post on here, I wanted to share my tip for spotting scammers quickly and easily without fail every time. 

The moment you start chatting with someone on the apps, within the first minute or two, ask them something very specific to your local area. 

- What's the best sushi/pizza slice/coffee shop/cannoli in our area? 

- [make a mildly sarcastic ""opposite"" comment about the weather, like if it has been raining a lot, say ""how about this crazy dry spell we've been having?"" Someone local will get that this is sarcastic, but scammers will unironically agree that it's been too dry.]

- What's a good hiking trail around here for beginners? I'd love to get into hiking myself. 

I can guarantee this works 100% of the time. Sometimes they will try to google it, but that means they will take *way too long* to respond.  That's your cue to stick with the local theme. Ultimately, scammers don't want to be putting in this much work. They will unmatch promptly if you ask about specific local things 2-3 times in a row.

But even if they don't, by the time you're 2-3 questions in, *you* will get a good sense of whether this person knows what they're talking about. Genuinely local people have enthusiastic opinions and will *want* to discuss local things. Scammers will try to get you off this subject. 

In my experience, this method has a 100% success rate in scammer spotting! And it only takes a few minutes.

**I’m officially done—and I’m so grateful to be completed!**

Huge thanks to everyone in this subreddit and the Discord. You’ve all been a part of my journey, and I wanted to share a little about my story.

I’m active duty military and rotated to shore duty in 2021. While there, I earned my qualifications and started school at Embry-Riddle, studying Project Management. It was a solid program, but it felt like I was just checking a box. That changed when I served under a Commanding Officer who was a full-on data nerd. He embraced data-driven decision-making, stayed technically sharp, and completely overhauled how we operated—from paper processes to fully digital workflows via SharePoint. This was very inspiring.

Around the same time, I took an Intro to Computer Science course at Embry-Riddle. I learned R, and one of the first things I coded was a basic slot machine script. I absolutely ripped my hair out over it—but once I got it working, I realized how much I loved the process. Coding felt like solving a puzzle piece by piece. For someone who never passed Algebra II in high school, this was a big revelation. It *clicked*. That was when I decided to switch to WGU in June 2023 and pursue something that felt more meaningful.

**Semester 1**

Progress was slow at first. I took my time digesting the material and only accelerated two courses. Still, I appreciated the freedom WGU offered. If I needed to step away for a few days, I could—without penalty.

**Semester 2**

Similar pace, but I accelerated three courses and started feeling proud of my progress. I was learning things I genuinely loved, and the pacing made all the difference.

**Semester 3**

This is when I hit my stride. I got organized and committed to at least **one hour per day**—usually broken into four 25-minute Pomodoro sessions. That minimal commitment often turned into longer sessions. It was a game-changer, especially on low-motivation days. This was also the semester my **son was born**—our first child—so time management became critical. Thankfully, I had three months of convalescent leave from the Navy, which helped me juggle everything. I accelerated four courses during this time.

**Semester 4**

I had a decision: take it easy and plan for another semester, or go all-in and finish before commissioning. I chose the latter. I was about to promote to **commissioned officer**, attend military schools, and report to my first duty station as a division officer—none of which are small tasks. I wanted to be fully present for all of it, so I *buckled down*.

This meant:

* **No video games**
* **Minimum two hours of study per day**
* **No days off except for family time**

My typical weekday:

* Work from 0700 to 1400
* Study from 1500 or 1600 to 1900
* Evenings were family time

Weekends were the real grind:

* Wake up at 0500
* Coffee + a little Shapez or Factorio to get my brain going
* Study from 0600 to 0900
* Bonus session in the afternoon from 1600 to 1900

It sounds like a lot, but by that point, I was in a groove. I finished **40 CUs** in that final semester—with 15 days left on the clock.

**And now… it’s done.**

I’m proud—but I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a little anticlimactic. I won’t use the degree directly in my day-to-day as a naval officer, but I know I’ve gained skills I can bring into the workplace, especially when it comes to implementing **data-driven process improvements**.

At the same time, I’m now staring into the void of *what next?* I decided to treat myself to a new computer—an M4 MacBook Pro—and picked up a few bundles on Blender 3D modeling and Godot game development from Humble Bundle. I think that’s going to be my new hobby for a while.

I’m not planning to start school again until I’ve fully settled into my new responsibilities as an officer, but I’m already eyeing the MSDA with a focus on Process Engineering. It might just be the thing to fill the gap I now feel after closing this big chapter.

Before I close, I want to speak to something I’ve seen a lot on this journey—people getting discouraged by others finishing their degree quickly. Let me be clear: **everyone has different circumstances, backgrounds, and time commitments.** Judging your own progress by someone else’s finish line is unproductive and, frankly, unfair to yourself. You don’t know what that person gave up, what support they had, or what they had to overcome. **Run your own race.** If seeing others’ success takes a toll on your mindset, it’s okay to step back from Reddit and use it strictly for course-specific guidance. Protect your focus. You owe it to yourself to stay locked in—not distracted or disheartened by someone else’s chapter 20 when you’re on chapter 5.

Thanks again to all of you who offered help, guidance, and motivation. See you on the next adventure.",12,1750354519.0,WGU,0,1.0,False

Please bear with me and keep in mind this is only from my perspective so there’s bound to be some bias but I’ll do my best. Names changed.

Our characters: 
Me: 25F 
My husband: 25M 
Olivia: 26F
Sara: 25F

Context: 
Olivia works for me- employee turned friend and went to highschool with Sara and my Husband. I knew she wasn’t economically in the best shape- it’s rough out there. So we’d help her when we could, paid for her to come out with us, let her have lots of flexibility at work, paid well above minimum wage (the position is a minimum wage position), made sure she had decent benefits (I didn’t need it because I get coverage under my husband), let her barrow one of our vehicles (I don’t drive and she would drive us around for work and we would pay for work mileage, maintenance, and insurance. She took very poor care of it and it’s now very damaged) and we didn’t ask for anything in return, maybe run me to a dr appointment here and there. She expressed that she wanted to find a different job because she didn’t make enough with me (fair enough) and my husband offered her a side gig where she would be a model as well as coming over once a week to help make the designs and attend 2 events (on an all expenses paid trip to Europe) for an extra $1000/month. She wasn’t satisfied with this long term and still was looking for something externally. No problem, I’ll keep my business open until she found something else to make sure she was okay. I was wanting to shut my business anyway as I’ve developed a chronic illness and could no longer do the physical work. There were a lot of times I felt like she took advantage but I let it go. 

We go to two European countries for 10 days with Sara and Olivia. My husband and I pay for the flights, hotels, and dinners, and extra things like high tea and a few outings, they were responsible for lunch’s, shopping, and any extras they want to do. Olivia is being super rude and condescending, even before we take off anywhere. 
Ex: Sara and Olivia haven’t travelled much and Sara forgot full size beauty products in her carry on and realized after we checked our baggage. I say to her “I’m sorry, security will take that stuff, you’re going to have to buy new stuff when we land” and Olivia jumps in rudely with “they won’t take it if it’s only partially full!” and I internally roll my eyes and explain “security goes by what the milliliters the bottle is; it doesn’t matter how much liquid is actually inside” and she just tried to continue arguing so whatever, security took the products and we moved on. 

This behaviour continues the whole trip. Just really condescending and combative and treating my husband and I like we have no idea what we’re talking about. She was also warned about tourist traps and what they look like- she got trapped in 2, she got out of the first one but the second one she dragged my husband in and he ended up paying $500 to get out of it… and then she yelled at my husband about telling his wife about the situation and insulting me behind my back to my husband: “I know how *me* thinks, she thinks she could’ve spent that money on herself… yada yada.” 

I privately talk to my husband and he agrees her behaviour is outrageous. To be clear, we didn’t expect her to spend every moment with us- go do your own thing, I don’t care, just, be nice? That’s really all I wanted was a nice friend’s trip. 

We finish the first leg of the trip and land in our second destination and my husband pulls Olivia aside in the airport and asked if she wanted to be there and if she didn’t, there was a return flight home. I wasn’t there so I can’t really comment on how this went down but I guess Olivia was trying to cause a scene and yell in the airport and my husband just walked away because he didn’t want to be detained. Oh I also found out later that she told my husband something I told her in confidence just to stir shit. 

We continue our trip and she seems normal for the first few days. We’re having a good time. Then she starts bothering us for payment. She had a pay day while we were there and she didn’t fill her hours in on our work portal and on a non working day she asked “hey can I use your laptop? The app won’t let me fill my hours in” (she’s supposed to fill hours daily and we’ve talked about it and she doesn’t; she puts all her hours in on pay day so I’m not sure how accurate her hours have been) and I say “just use the safari browser, that’s what I do and all the functions work fine” and she gets argumentative and says “no it doesn’t work” and I explain that I’m not talking about using the app. Whatever, I’m done with the conversation at that point and say “I’m not dealing with this right now” and then she asks my husband when he’ll pay her. He paid her later that evening I believe but only paid for what work she did, she only attended 1/2 events listed in her contract. This was a big point of contention for her. 

The last 3 days of the trip my husband and I don’t see her at all. It feels like she was actively avoiding us. Whatever, we still hung out with Sara. 

We see Olivia for the first time in 3 days and it’s as we’re leaving the hotel to catch our flight. At 5:30am… she’s drunk and hanging off some random dude, she’d been up all night clubbing (whatever, live your life but don’t be loud about it and make it my problem, please?). Anyway, I’m not a very nice person that early in the morning running on 3 hours sleep so instead of saying anything in the taxi, I just put my headphones in and chill. We get to the airport and she’s still club dancing and being so loud. We get through with little issue. 

I sit with my husband and he tells me something about her saying something about not wanting to drive the car anymore while we were in the taxi, confused, I went to go ask her about it. 

Conversation went like this: 
Me: hey, ready to get back to work? 
Olivia: …….. (longest 2 second pause of my life) 
Olivia: idk why you’re asking me that right now 
Me: because we’re going home, back to the real world? 
Olivia: I guess. 
Me: I haven’t seen you in the last 3 days, what happened? 
Olivia: yea, that was intentional 
Me: oh? Why? 
Olivia: your husband threatened me in an airport
Me: yea I asked him to talk to you because of how you were treating everyone- you were being really rude 
Olivia: yea well I didn’t want to be at your beck and call and your little lap dog the whole time
Me: whoa, no one said you had to spend every second with us. My husband also mentioned something about the car? What’s going on with that? 
Olivia: yea well I don’t feel comfortable driving it anymore soooo you can uber with all the supplies and I’ll meet you at our jobs by bus. 
**me. Stunned.** 
Me: okayyyy, I’m going to find coffee. 

She then starts shit talking us in the airport to other random people (they would sit next to her, she starts ranting, and they would leave a few minutes later looking visibly uncomfortable) and to Sara with us sitting within earshot. She’s officially broken her disparagement clause in the contract she had with my husband. 

We finally sit on the plane and my husband sends her a termination email. She loses it. “This is why you guys don’t have any friends” and “I quit **my company**” along with a lot of profanity. To the point where Sara had to say “shut up before you get kicked off the plane” and she sits and is quiet. Then she starts trying to take pictures of us and I hold my hand out in front of her camera and said “actually I really don’t want photos taken of me right now” and in response “I’m just documenting everything to protect myself” and I just said “of us sitting on a plane….?” 

Anyway. She left me high and dry with client appointments to do myself. Doubling the time it takes to complete each appointment and significantly harder on my body. Great. 

We land and board our next flight and she’s avoiding us. Sara is trying to stay out of it as much as she can. We land in our home airport and she’s chatting with my husband about where to leave the supplies she has and getting her stuff from inside the car (parked at our house for the duration of the trip) and he said “go talk to *me*, I have nothing to do with this” 

I get a text about it and I don’t respond. We leave and go home. 
We email her back and forth about what happened and next steps and her story changes so many times that she starts contradicting herself and eventually stops. At one point, claiming she hadn’t quit her job with me. 

A few days later I message Sara “hey, are you upset about what went down?” 

I didn’t get a response for 2 weeks. To the day. Basically saying “yea that was incredibly immature of you and your husband, you won’t be seeing me for some time, how could you guys do that to a so called friend, I’m standing by Olivia” (really shortened it down but broad strokes are there)

Never even have had a glimpse and no mystical experiences. I started thinking yesterday that maybe I need to stop listening to all nonduality “teachers” and stop reading and learning the various traditional schools of information after seeing the Emerson Non-Duality video “I have PhD in Seeking”. Also that I needed to stop listening to other peoples experiences. My mind just wants to conceptualize all of it and turn it into something for me to cling to. 

I am very analytically minded. When I do something I tend to be all in. I even started using ChatGTP as my nondual coach. 😂 I created a bootcamp-esk weekly schedule for myself to incorporate emotional, body, and nonduality work. I tried to incorporate as many things into it in hopes that one of them would work. 😂 My crazy schedule:

Like my mind has been in overdrive trying to figure this all out. Wanting to know EVERYTHING. Hence my post about “Why the Illusion?” (Or something like that) 

But yesterday after finding Emerson my mind said, “ This is it! The way. I only need to watch Emerson 1 on 1 sessions until it happens. I need to drop everything else.” Something in me knows that this should be easy and simple. I know I overanalyze and overthink everything. I also know that despite making this insane schedule for myself that I will not even follow it. I’m ADHD and not a very disciplined person. My mind is just keeping me busy with planning to feel like I am doing something when I’m really not. And it doesn’t matter. But my feelings know this should feel like ease and peace. It is already here. We are already this. This is simple and right here right now. If it was a snake it would have bit me as we say in the south. We create so many stories and so much struggle for ourselves. It is like an addiction. The mind is always projecting everything into the future. The mind is always saying “next” or looking into the past. In a sense language and words are the veil.

Then I went to sleep to wake up this morning and started watching Angelo’s talk with Sasha. (“Weird Stuff Started Happening…”) Sasha was talking about how dangerous it is when we think we know something. Those are the thoughts we aren’t questioning. Those are the thoughts we believe without realizing it. They are the beliefs. Our minds are a liar, which I already understood but like I understood that much deeper this time. It’s not just lying sometimes. It’s always lying. Every time I think I know something, THAT is what’s getting in the way. The feeling of importance the mind gives things is the carrot. The thinking you know something is the barrier because they are the beliefs. Everything I’m thinking, even me thinking that I figured out the way or that I think I now know the mind is a liar at a deeper level and know these feelings of importance about the carrots are even a veil. 🤯 

The only thing I feel I need to do now is to pick apart every thought I have until there is nothing left to pick apart. This is what my mind logics for now since that’s the only perspective I have atm. 🤷🏼‍♀️ ",1,1750354391.0,nonduality,2,1.0,False

Prior to this, I would drink one 16oz cup in the morning and additional 20oz cups throughout the day while at work.  Sometimes well into the later afternoons.  

Once I got sick, I cut back but when I felt good enough, I would drink some.

Lately it appears that once I get down to half of my 16oz cup, I feel brain fog, anxiety, fatigue, whatever may be the best way to describe it.   I noticed my one 16oz cup was a challenge to finish, and if I did it would be the whole day, like until 4pm.

Downloaded a sleep app and since Tuesday,  have been going to bed at the same time and waking up at the same time.  

Not sure if my tolerance went down during the illness or what but I don't want it.

I’ve never been “regular,” and have always had bouts of totally normal movements mixed with prolonged periods of constipation. I would get pretty extreme bloating after big meals that made me super uncomfortable for a day. So I started making Metamucil a part of my daily regimen, usually about a tablespoon and a half close to bedtime. That would put me in the bathroom 2-3 times a day.

Lately my diet hasn’t been all that great, so the other day I took two good servings of Metamucil, one tablespoon earlier in the day and another at night. 

Let me tell you, yesterday morning after my coffee the train started rolling, and it put me in the bathroom 6 times. The first couple times were pretty routine, but that turned into pretty awful diarrhea the rest of the day. Eventually it tapered off and today I haven’t had to run to the bathroom, thankfully.

First time posting so please bear with me and keep in mind this is only from my perspective so there’s bound to be some bias but I’ll do my best. Names changed.

Our characters: 
Me: 25F 
My husband: 25M 
Olivia: 26F
Sara: 25F

Context: 
Olivia works for me- employee turned friend and went to highschool with Sara and my Husband. I knew she wasn’t economically in the best shape- it’s rough out there. So we’d help her when we could, paid for her to come out with us, let her have lots of flexibility at work, paid well above minimum wage (the position is a minimum wage position), made sure she had decent benefits (I didn’t need it because I get coverage under my husband), let her barrow one of our vehicles (I don’t drive and she would drive us around for work and we would pay for work mileage, maintenance, and insurance. She took very poor care of it and it’s now very damaged) and we didn’t ask for anything in return, maybe run me to a dr appointment here and there. She expressed that she wanted to find a different job because she didn’t make enough with me (fair enough) and my husband offered her a side gig where she would be a model as well as coming over once a week to help make the designs and attend 2 events (on an all expenses paid trip to Europe) for an extra $1000/month. She wasn’t satisfied with this long term and still was looking for something externally. No problem, I’ll keep my business open until she found something else to make sure she was okay. I was wanting to shut my business anyway as I’ve developed a chronic illness and could no longer do the physical work. There were a lot of times I felt like she took advantage but I let it go. 

We go to two European countries for 10 days with Sara and Olivia. My husband and I pay for the flights, hotels, and dinners, and extra things like high tea and a few outings, they were responsible for lunch’s, shopping, and any extras they want to do. Olivia is being super rude and condescending, even before we take off anywhere. 
Ex: Sara and Olivia haven’t travelled much and Sara forgot full size beauty products in her carry on and realized after we checked our baggage. I say to her “I’m sorry, security will take that stuff, you’re going to have to buy new stuff when we land” and Olivia jumps in rudely with “they won’t take it if it’s only partially full!” and I internally roll my eyes and explain “security goes by what the milliliters the bottle is; it doesn’t matter how much liquid is actually inside” and she just tried to continue arguing so whatever, security took the products and we moved on. 

This behaviour continues the whole trip. Just really condescending and combative and treating my husband and I like we have no idea what we’re talking about. She was also warned about tourist traps and what they look like- she got trapped in 2, she got out of the first one but the second one she dragged my husband in and he ended up paying $500 to get out of it… and then she yelled at my husband about telling his wife about the situation and insulting me behind my back to my husband: “I know how *me* thinks, she thinks she could’ve spent that money on herself… yada yada.” 

I privately talk to my husband and he agrees her behaviour is outrageous. To be clear, we didn’t expect her to spend every moment with us- go do your own thing, I don’t care, just, be nice? That’s really all I wanted was a nice friend’s trip. 

We finish the first leg of the trip and land in our second destination and my husband pulls Olivia aside in the airport and asked if she wanted to be there and if she didn’t, there was a return flight home. I wasn’t there so I can’t really comment on how this went down but I guess Olivia was trying to cause a scene and yell in the airport and my husband just walked away because he didn’t want to be detained. Oh I also found out later that she told my husband something I told her in confidence just to stir shit. 

We continue our trip and she seems normal for the first few days. We’re having a good time. Then she starts bothering us for payment. She had a pay day while we were there and she didn’t fill her hours in on our work portal and on a non working day she asked “hey can I use your laptop? The app won’t let me fill my hours in” (she’s supposed to fill hours daily and we’ve talked about it and she doesn’t; she puts all her hours in on pay day so I’m not sure how accurate her hours have been) and I say “just use the safari browser, that’s what I do and all the functions work fine” and she gets argumentative and says “no it doesn’t work” and I explain that I’m not talking about using the app. Whatever, I’m done with the conversation at that point and say “I’m not dealing with this right now” and then she asks my husband when he’ll pay her. He paid her later that evening I believe but only paid for what work she did, she only attended 1/2 events listed in her contract. This was a big point of contention for her. 

The last 3 days of the trip my husband and I don’t see her at all. It feels like she was actively avoiding us. Whatever, we still hung out with Sara. 

We see Olivia for the first time in 3 days and it’s as we’re leaving the hotel to catch our flight. At 5:30am… she’s drunk and hanging off some random dude, she’d been up all night clubbing (whatever, live your life but don’t be loud about it and make it my problem, please?). Anyway, I’m not a very nice person that early in the morning running on 3 hours sleep so instead of saying anything in the taxi, I just put my headphones in and chill. We get to the airport and she’s still club dancing and being so loud. We get through with little issue. 

I sit with my husband and he tells me something about her saying something about not wanting to drive the car anymore while we were in the taxi, confused, I went to go ask her about it. 

Conversation went like this: 
Me: hey, ready to get back to work? 
Olivia: …….. (longest 2 second pause of my life) 
Olivia: idk why you’re asking me that right now 
Me: because we’re going home, back to the real world? 
Olivia: I guess. 
Me: I haven’t seen you in the last 3 days, what happened? 
Olivia: yea, that was intentional 
Me: oh? Why? 
Olivia: your husband threatened me in an airport
Me: yea I asked him to talk to you because of how you were treating everyone- you were being really rude 
Olivia: yea well I didn’t want to be at your beck and call and your little lap dog the whole time
Me: whoa, no one said you had to spend every second with us. My husband also mentioned something about the car? What’s going on with that? 
Olivia: yea well I don’t feel comfortable driving it anymore soooo you can uber with all the supplies and I’ll meet you at our jobs by bus. 
**me. Stunned.** 
Me: okayyyy, I’m going to find coffee. 

She then starts shit talking us in the airport to other random people (they would sit next to her, she starts ranting, and they would leave a few minutes later looking visibly uncomfortable) and to Sara with us sitting within earshot. She’s officially broken her disparagement clause in the contract she had with my husband. 

We finally sit on the plane and my husband sends her a termination email. She loses it. “This is why you guys don’t have any friends” and “I quit **my company**” along with a lot of profanity. To the point where Sara had to say “shut up before you get kicked off the plane” and she sits and is quiet. Then she starts trying to take pictures of us and I hold my hand out in front of her camera and said “actually I really don’t want photos taken of me right now” and in response “I’m just documenting everything to protect myself” and I just said “of us sitting on a plane….?” 

Anyway. She left me high and dry with client appointments to do myself. Doubling the time it takes to complete each appointment and significantly harder on my body. Great. 

We land and board our next flight and she’s avoiding us. Sara is trying to stay out of it as much as she can. We land in our home airport and she’s chatting with my husband about where to leave the supplies she has and getting her stuff from inside the car (parked at our house for the duration of the trip) and he said “go talk to *me*, I have nothing to do with this” 

I get a text about it and I don’t respond. We leave and go home. 
We email her back and forth about what happened and next steps and her story changes so many times that she starts contradicting herself and eventually stops. At one point, claiming she hadn’t quit her job with me. 

A few days later I message Sara “hey, are you upset about what went down?” 

I didn’t get a response for 2 weeks. To the day. Basically saying “yea that was incredibly immature of you and your husband, you won’t be seeing me for some time, how could you guys do that to a so called friend, I’m standing by Olivia” (really shortened it down but broad strokes are there)

Hi all,
I (29F) went no-contact with my parents 3 years ago. My mom is the narcissist, my dad the enabler. I grew up in a home full of emotional manipulation, physical abuse, shame, and invalidation. I’ve been having intense flashbacks lately and it's been wrecking me emotionally.

Some of what I experienced:

1) My mom hit me in the eye as a child before a public function — I had to lie and say I fell.

2) She used fire to threaten me and once burned my ankle. I couldn’t light a matchstick till I was 15. I realised that it was abuse a lot later in life.

3) I was terrified to tell her I got my first period. I hid it for months until she found out and beat me.

4) I lied about my marks once in 5th grade out of fear and was humiliated when they found out — I was still first in class.

5) As a 23-year-old, I was physically assaulted by my dad (egged on by my mom) and then told that its because they care for me.

6) Every gift came with strings attached — nothing was unconditional, everything had guilt or control built into it.

7) I also realized over the years that my mom often seemed jealous of me.

8) She’d go through my personal things — skincare, makeup, journals — and then pretend it was no big deal. She would dress like me, buy similar skincare products that I used and also hid all nice things in the house.

9) If I bought something for myself or spent time taking care of my appearance, she’d make snide, passive-aggressive remarks or copy what I bought and hide it.

10) Once I bought some specialty coffee samples — she hid them from me because she paid for the exhibition entry. Months later, she sent a gift box with a huge coffee jar to guilt-trip me when I left home.

It was subtle, but consistent. She didn’t want me to have things she didn’t control. And if I showed joy or independence, she tried to dull it or claim it as her own.

I haven’t seen them in 3 years. I have a loving partner now. I thought I’d visit home on my dad’s 60th birthday — maybe try again — but I froze. I didn’t feel safe.

I sent a calm birthday message saying I was working through a lot emotionally. He replied with emotional blackmail, ignored my feelings, and spammed me with videos about how “parents are everything.” Eventually, I blocked him. I blocked my mom almost a year and a half ago after she had multiple episodes and verbally abused me on the family group.

Four days later, he messaged me from another number:

""Will you even come visit us when we’re dead?""
I sent him all the screenshots of all the mean things she wrote through his phone. He said it wad written in an emotional state, I should be the bigger person and forgive them.

My body shut down. I panicked and hid in the bathroom and cried. This is what happens every time I try to engage, even a little.

And still, part of me wonders:

Am I overreacting? What if they were right? What if I’m just an ungrateful daughter?

But the truth is — I never once felt safe enough to tell them when I was hurting. Not when I got dumped. Not when I was broke. Not when I was hungry. Not even now.

I’m trying to heal and build a life, but the flashbacks, guilt, and grief keep hitting me like waves.

Has anyone else had parents guilt-trip after going no contact?

I’m a 34-year-old gay guy living in Ottawa and I’m hoping for some perspective (and maybe a reality check). I’m relationship-oriented, financially stable, work in tech, and spend most of my free time gaming or hanging out with a small circle of close friends (mostly straight). Lately the dating scene has me feeling stuck and discouraged:

* **Apps feel like a revolving door.** Matches seldom move past a few messages, or the conversation dies the moment I suggest meeting for coffee. Profiles say “looking for something real,” but actions scream “casual only.”
* **Distance makes everything harder.** I keep matching with guys in Toronto or Montreal. When I mention the logistics, interest fades fast. I’m willing to put in effort for long distance if there’s actual momentum, but it never gets that far.
* **Past relationships were rough.** In my 20s I dated an alcoholic, then a textbook narcissist. The guy I’m currently seeing casually (who I really like) also shows narcissistic traits and seems to be stringing me along. I catch myself trying to “convince” him into commitment, which can’t be healthy.
* **Limited queer social circle.** I don’t hit the bars much and don’t have many gay friends, so meeting people organically is tough.
* **Probably limiting myself.** I have a *type* and I’m starting to wonder if that’s narrowing my options or pulling me toward the same unhealthy patterns.

What I’m looking for is simple on paper: someone local (or at least willing to build something serious), who wants partnership over hookups, values loyalty, and enjoys low-key nights in as much as the occasional adventure. Yet I keep striking out.",2,1750353764.0,gaydating,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The performance and appeal of a campfire scented candle hinge on several essential characteristics. These features determine how well the candle replicates the intended aroma and overall aesthetic of a campfire experience.

**Scent Authenticity:**

The most crucial aspect of any campfire scented candle is how accurately it captures the scent of a real campfire. A good candle should evoke notes of smoky wood, hints of char, and potentially subtle nuances of spices or pine, depending on the desired complexity. Lower-quality candles may smell artificial, overly sweet, or more like burnt plastic than actual firewood. Authenticity is achieved through careful selection of fragrance oils and their skillful blending.

**Burn Time and Wax Quality:**

the longevity of a candle, measured by its burn time, is a meaningful factor for consumers. Premium candles use higher-quality waxes that burn cleaner and longer. Soy wax, beeswax, and coconut wax blends are frequently enough preferred over paraffin wax due to their eco-friendliness and lower soot production. The wax quality also influences the scent throw – the ability of the candle to disperse its fragrance throughout the room.

**Scent Throw:**

A candle's scent throw determines how effectively the fragrance is released and fills a space. It depends on the concentration of fragrance oils, the type of wax used, and the size of the wick. A weak scent throw will leave the candle unnoticed, while an overpowering scent throw can be overwhelming. The ideal campfire scented candle offers a balanced scent throw, subtly yet consistently filling the room with a comforting and inviting aroma.

**Wick Type and Performance:**

The wick plays a critical role in a candle's overall performance. Different types of wicks, such as cotton, wood, or paper, affect the burn rate, flame size, and amount of smoke produced. A well-chosen wick will ensure a clean, even burn, preventing tunneling (when the wax burns down the center, leaving a ring of un-melted wax around the edge) and excessive smoke. Wooden wicks often enhance the campfire ambiance by producing a soft crackling sound reminiscent of a real fire.

**Container Material and Design:**

The candle container is more than just a vessel; it contributes to the overall aesthetic. Common materials include glass, metal, and ceramic. The design can range from simple and minimalist to rustic and decorative. A sturdy, well-designed container enhances the candle's appearance and ensures safety during burning. Some containers are also reusable, adding to their value.

**Ingredients and sustainability:**

Increasingly, consumers are concerned about the ingredients used in candles and their impact on the habitat. Candles made with natural waxes, essential oils, and lead-free wicks are preferred. Enduring practices, such as using recycled or recyclable materials for packaging, also contribute to a candle's overall appeal.

## Core Benefits

A high-quality campfire scented candle offers several benefits beyond simply filling a room with fragrance.These benefits impact emotions, ambiance, and overall well-being.

**Creates a Cozy and Relaxing Atmosphere:** The primary benefit of a campfire scented candle is its ability to evoke feelings of warmth, comfort, and relaxation.

This creates a soothing ambiance, ideal for unwinding after a long day or enhancing a cozy evening at home.

**reduces Stress and Anxiety:** The familiar and comforting scent of a campfire can have a calming effect on the mind. Studies have shown that certain scents can trigger positive emotional responses, reducing stress and anxiety levels. the gentle flicker of the flame further enhances the relaxing effect, creating a sense of serenity.

**Enhances Focus and Concentration:** While primarily associated with relaxation, a campfire scent can also improve focus and concentration for some individuals. The subtle, grounding aroma can definitely help center the mind, making it easier to concentrate on tasks or engage in creative endeavors. This is particularly beneficial for those who work from home or need a calming environment to focus.

**Masks Unpleasant odors:** Campfire scented candles can effectively neutralize and mask unpleasant odors, such as pet smells, cooking odors, or musty scents. The strong, smoky aroma overpowers unwanted smells, leaving the room smelling fresh and inviting. This makes them a practical solution for improving air quality and creating a more pleasant living environment.

**Adds a Touch of Rustic charm:** Beyond its functional benefits, a campfire scented candle can also add a touch of rustic charm to any space. Whether placed on a coffee table, bookshelf, or mantelpiece, the candle's design and scent contribute to a warm and inviting atmosphere. They can also serve as decorative accents,complementing a variety of interior styles.

## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of campfire scented candles can bring questions to mind. This section addresses some common concerns to ensure buyers find exactly what they need, while also improving customer satisfaction.

**How long will a typical campfire scented candle burn?**
The burn time varies depending on the size of the candle, the type of wax used, and how frequently it is burned. Generally, a small candle (4-6 ounces) may burn for 20-30 hours, while a larger candle (12-16 ounces) can burn for 50-80 hours. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for optimal burn time and safety.

**Are campfire scented candles safe for people with sensitivities or allergies?**
While most high-quality candles use natural fragrance oils, some individuals may still experience sensitivities or allergies. If you have known sensitivities to certain scents, it's advisable to choose candles made with essential oils or those labeled as hypoallergenic. Always burn candles in a well-ventilated area and discontinue use if you experience any adverse reactions.

**What is the best way to care for my campfire scented candle to maximize its lifespan?**
To ensure a long and even burn, trim the candle wick to ¼ inch before each use. This prevents smoking and sooting. Allow the candle to burn for at least 2-3 hours during the first use to create a full melt pool, preventing tunneling. Avoid burning the candle for more than 4 hours at a time, and always extinguish it properly using a snuffer or by gently blowing it out. Allow the wax to cool and harden before relighting.

**Can I reuse the container after the candle has burned out?**
Many candle containers can be reused once the wax has been entirely burned out.To remove any residual wax, you can place the container in the freezer for a few hours, then gently scrape out the frozen wax. Alternatively, you can pour hot water into the container (avoiding splashing) to melt the remaining wax, which can then be easily removed. Clean the container thoroughly with soap and water before reusing it for other purposes, such as storing small items or as a decorative vase.

First time posting so please bear with me and keep in mind this is only from my perspective so there’s bound to be some bias but I’ll do my best. Names changed.

Our characters: 
Me: 25F 
My husband: 25M 
Olivia: 26F
Sara: 25F

Context: 
Olivia works for me- employee turned friend and went to highschool with Sara and my Husband. I knew she wasn’t economically in the best shape- it’s rough out there. So we’d help her when we could, paid for her to come out with us, let her have lots of flexibility at work, paid well above minimum wage (the position is a minimum wage position), made sure she had decent benefits (I didn’t need it because I get coverage under my husband), let her barrow one of our vehicles (I don’t drive and she would drive us around for work and we would pay for work mileage, maintenance, and insurance. She took very poor care of it and it’s now very damaged) and we didn’t ask for anything in return, maybe run me to a dr appointment here and there. She expressed that she wanted to find a different job because she didn’t make enough with me (fair enough) and my husband offered her a side gig where she would be a model as well as coming over once a week to help make the designs and attend 2 events (on an all expenses paid trip to Europe) for an extra $1000/month. She wasn’t satisfied with this long term and still was looking for something externally. No problem, I’ll keep my business open until she found something else to make sure she was okay. I was wanting to shut my business anyway as I’ve developed a chronic illness and could no longer do the physical work. There were a lot of times I felt like she took advantage but I let it go. 

We go to two European countries for 10 days with Sara and Olivia. My husband and I pay for the flights, hotels, and dinners, and extra things like high tea and a few outings, they were responsible for lunch’s, shopping, and any extras they want to do. Olivia is being super rude and condescending, even before we take off anywhere. 
Ex: Sara and Olivia haven’t travelled much and Sara forgot full size beauty products in her carry on and realized after we checked our baggage. I say to her “I’m sorry, security will take that stuff, you’re going to have to buy new stuff when we land” and Olivia jumps in rudely with “they won’t take it if it’s only partially full!” and I internally roll my eyes and explain “security goes by what the milliliters the bottle is; it doesn’t matter how much liquid is actually inside” and she just tried to continue arguing so whatever, security took the products and we moved on. 

This behaviour continues the whole trip. Just really condescending and combative and treating my husband and I like we have no idea what we’re talking about. She was also warned about tourist traps and what they look like- she got trapped in 2, she got out of the first one but the second one she dragged my husband in and he ended up paying $500 to get out of it… and then she yelled at my husband about telling his wife about the situation and insulting me behind my back to my husband: “I know how *me* thinks, she thinks she could’ve spent that money on herself… yada yada.” 

I privately talk to my husband and he agrees her behaviour is outrageous. To be clear, we didn’t expect her to spend every moment with us- go do your own thing, I don’t care, just, be nice? That’s really all I wanted was a nice friend’s trip. 

We finish the first leg of the trip and land in our second destination and my husband pulls Olivia aside in the airport and asked if she wanted to be there and if she didn’t, there was a return flight home. I wasn’t there so I can’t really comment on how this went down but I guess Olivia was trying to cause a scene and yell in the airport and my husband just walked away because he didn’t want to be detained. Oh I also found out later that she told my husband something I told her in confidence just to stir shit. 

We continue our trip and she seems normal for the first few days. We’re having a good time. Then she starts bothering us for payment. She had a pay day while we were there and she didn’t fill her hours in on our work portal and on a non working day she asked “hey can I use your laptop? The app won’t let me fill my hours in” (she’s supposed to fill hours daily and we’ve talked about it and she doesn’t; she puts all her hours in on pay day so I’m not sure how accurate her hours have been) and I say “just use the safari browser, that’s what I do and all the functions work fine” and she gets argumentative and says “no it doesn’t work” and I explain that I’m not talking about using the app. Whatever, I’m done with the conversation at that point and say “I’m not dealing with this right now” and then she asks my husband when he’ll pay her. He paid her later that evening I believe but only paid for what work she did, she only attended 1/2 events listed in her contract. This was a big point of contention for her. 

The last 3 days of the trip my husband and I don’t see her at all. It feels like she was actively avoiding us. Whatever, we still hung out with Sara. 

We see Olivia for the first time in 3 days and it’s as we’re leaving the hotel to catch our flight. At 5:30am… she’s drunk and hanging off some random dude, she’d been up all night clubbing (whatever, live your life but don’t be loud about it and make it my problem, please?). Anyway, I’m not a very nice person that early in the morning running on 3 hours sleep so instead of saying anything in the taxi, I just put my headphones in and chill. We get to the airport and she’s still club dancing and being so loud. We get through with little issue. 

I sit with my husband and he tells me something about her saying something about not wanting to drive the car anymore while we were in the taxi, confused, I went to go ask her about it. 

Conversation went like this: 
Me: hey, ready to get back to work? 
Olivia: …….. (longest 2 second pause of my life) 
Olivia: idk why you’re asking me that right now 
Me: because we’re going home, back to the real world? 
Olivia: I guess. 
Me: I haven’t seen you in the last 3 days, what happened? 
Olivia: yea, that was intentional 
Me: oh? Why? 
Olivia: your husband threatened me in an airport
Me: yea I asked him to talk to you because of how you were treating everyone- you were being really rude 
Olivia: yea well I didn’t want to be at your beck and call and your little lap dog the whole time
Me: whoa, no one said you had to spend every second with us. My husband also mentioned something about the car? What’s going on with that? 
Olivia: yea well I don’t feel comfortable driving it anymore soooo you can uber with all the supplies and I’ll meet you at our jobs by bus. 
**me. Stunned.** 
Me: okayyyy, I’m going to find coffee. 

She then starts shit talking us in the airport to other random people (they would sit next to her, she starts ranting, and they would leave a few minutes later looking visibly uncomfortable) and to Sara with us sitting within earshot. She’s officially broken her disparagement clause in the contract she had with my husband. 

We finally sit on the plane and my husband sends her a termination email. She loses it. “This is why you guys don’t have any friends” and “I quit **my company**” along with a lot of profanity. To the point where Sara had to say “shut up before you get kicked off the plane” and she sits and is quiet. Then she starts trying to take pictures of us and I hold my hand out in front of her camera and said “actually I really don’t want photos taken of me right now” and in response “I’m just documenting everything to protect myself” and I just said “of us sitting on a plane….?” 

Anyway. She left me high and dry with client appointments to do myself. Doubling the time it takes to complete each appointment and significantly harder on my body. Great. 

We land and board our next flight and she’s avoiding us. Sara is trying to stay out of it as much as she can. We land in our home airport and she’s chatting with my husband about where to leave the supplies she has and getting her stuff from inside the car (parked at our house for the duration of the trip) and he said “go talk to *me*, I have nothing to do with this” 

I get a text about it and I don’t respond. We leave and go home. 
We email her back and forth about what happened and next steps and her story changes so many times that she starts contradicting herself and eventually stops. At one point, claiming she hadn’t quit her job with me. 

A few days later I message Sara “hey, are you upset about what went down?” 

I didn’t get a response for 2 weeks. To the day. Basically saying “yea that was incredibly immature of you and your husband, you won’t be seeing me for some time, how could you guys do that to a so called friend, I’m standing by Olivia” (really shortened it down but broad strokes are there) 
Great. I lost 2 friends over this.

1lfghor,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGames/comments/1lfghor/depressive_games_arent_for_depressive_mood_its_a/,Depressive games aren’t for depressive mood - it’s a trap we all fall into thinking they’ll help us when actually they hurt us,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on r/ gamingsuggestions where people ask for games to play after a tough breakup. And I keep seeing suggestions like **Disco Elysium** or Soulsborne games. Don’t get me wrong, I love **Disco Elysium,** it’s a masterpiece but recommending it to someone who's already feeling low n down on their luck? That just doesn’t make sense to me and  never did, even though I had people telling me otherwise, insistently. I mean, in Disco you're playing as a depressed alcoholic, junkie cop in a dying world. It’s powerful, but definitely not something a person needs during a difficult time when they need to cope with/ face their own feelings..

When I went through a bad breakup last year, I made the same mistake. I dove into dark, moody games like **Alan Wake** and the **Silent Hill 2** remake, thinking they'd “match my mood” but they just made things worse. Great games…but again, not for that headspace I was in.

What actually helped me heal was **Last Epoch** and **Among Us**, but also because I was playing them with friends on Discord, more’s the company as they say and there’s better to chill out than a game sesh with the homeboys. My best friend showed up one weekend, dragged me out for coffee and gave me a wake up call. When I got home, I cleaned my room, took a long shower, and jumped back online in the evening to hang out with my friends. I made a new mage in Last Epoch and just started just grinding away while talking with the boys. It felt good even if it was hard at first, to just be around people and listening to them,  talking, laughing. Getting those little dopamine hits from loot and progress definitely helped to just relax and chill out. It was actually just what I needed. I had my short term goals which I was chasing, my mind was occupied with gameplay that was simple enough not to actively think about all the time, and I just felt myself talking with my friends in the background with no effort.

We played regularly for a few weeks, mixing in some Among Us whenever we could assemble the crew. And slowly I began feeling like myself again after a couple of weeks of actually talking to people and playing low stress games. I’ve moved on since, focused more on myself, and I’ve actually found someone two months ago so it all ended happily for me. But this is the sorry lesson I learned (at least for myself) – that the heavy, existential stuff I should just avoid when I’m depressed. Instead of mending the wounds, it just makes them more irritable and isn’t doing me any good…

I’m not sure if you have different experiences from me though. Do you feel that the somber, darker, moody games sit better with you when you’re also - ditto - or do you play the easier, calmer stuff so you can put your mind off the darkness?",13,1750353659.0,AskGames,2,0.93,False

I've been a little wistful as we have a recent college graduate so I'm thinking this may be our last family trip ... or maybe I'm just emotional from the graduation.

I never saw any poor coffee, and it was a blessing it was so, for it became the solders’ solace and stay, in camp, on picket and on the march.

Tired, footsore, and dusty from the march, or wet and cold on picket, or homesick and shivering in camp, there were rest and comfort and new life in a cup of hot coffee.”

Hitchcock settled in Scranton before the Civil War, becoming an officer in the US Army during the conflict.

He served with the 132nd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, a unit made up of many soldiers from the Anthracite Coal Region.

Apparently, he was also quite the lover of all things coffee.

**TL;DR**: If you're here looking for a tl;dr, you're already doing it wrong. Read the whole damn thing or go apply for a job that doesn't involve critical thinking. (And read the comments too!)

### Quick Role Definition
First, let’s level set: this sub is mostly dedicated to **pre-sales** SEs who handle the “technical” parts of a sale. We work with a pure sales rep (Account Executive, Customer Success Manager, or whatever fancy title they go by) to convince someone to buy our product or service. This might involve product demos, technical deep dives, handling objections, running Proof of Concepts (PoCs), or a hundred other tasks that demonstrate how our product solves the customer’s real-world problems. 

Also take note: This post and most of the users here are in some sort of technical field, the vast majority working with some sort of SaaS or similar. There are sales engineer roles in industries like HVAC, and occasionally we get folks doing that kind of work here but not often and most everything we are talking about here is focused on tech related SE roles.

### The Titles (Yes, They’re Confusing)
Sure, we call it “Sales Engineer,” but you’ll see it labeled as Solutions Engineer, Solutions Consultant, Solutions Architect, Customer Engineer, and plenty of other names. Titles vary by industry, company, and sometimes the team within the company. If you’re in an interview and the job description looks like pre-sales, but the title is something else, don’t freak out it’s often the same old role wearing a different name tag.

### The Secret Sauce: Primary Qualities of a Great SE
A successful SE typically blends **Technical Skills**, **Soft Skills**, and **Domain Expertise** in some combination. You don’t have to be a “principal developer” or a “marketing guru,” but you do need a balanced skill set:

1. **Technical Chops** – You must understand the product well enough to show it off, speak to how it’s built, and answer tough questions. Sometimes that means code-level knowledge. Other times it’s more high-level architecture or integrations. Your mileage may vary.

2. **Soft Skills** – Communication, empathy, and the ability to read a room are huge. You have to distill complex concepts into digestible bites for prospects ranging from the C-suite with a five-second attention span to that one DevOps guru who’ll quiz you on every obscure config file.

3. **Domain Expertise** – If you’re selling security software, you should know the basics of security (at least!). If you’re in the manufacturing sector, you should be able to talk about the production process. Whatever your product does, be ready to drop knowledge that shows you *get* the customer’s world.

______

OK - so let's get to why you are probably here. 

### You want to get a job as an SE and don't know how.

Let's dig in:

### I'm in college and would like to be a sales engineer

I'm sorry to tell you this is typically not a role you get right out of college. It stings, I know. I'm sorry. But it's a job that generally requires all three of the items listed above:    

1. Technical Chops
1. Soft Skills
1. **Domain Expertise** 

Domain Expertise is the real tough one for the college student.  
Here's the deal - when working as an SE you need to be able to empathize with your buyers, which means you need to know their pain. This is why folks who do transition into this role very often are transitioning from a position in which they used the product(s) or a competitive product and generally understand the **pain points** others in that industry have. 

That said - let's not completely gloss over technical chops and soft skills either. Sure a top notch CS grad might have some pretty developed technical chops, but they are mostly pretty theoretical, not ""real world"" experience and just like domain expertise a history of working in the industry you are selling to is much more valuable than being able to solve leetcode mediums.   

And soft skills? Sure, you like talking to people much more than sitting behind a keyboard all day. That doesn't necessarily mean you know how to value sell or handle yourself with dignity when getting pummeled by some ass hat CTO who wants to show everyone in the room how much smarter they are than you. 

**What about college recruitment programs, or associate SE programs at the handful of companies that offer them?** 

Certainly an option. There aren't a ton of these programs but there are a few. I'd caution you to think of them not unlike an internship. Completion rates for some of this programs have been less than impressive over the long term, but they are not completely without merit.  If you are dead set on getting into an SE role right out of school this is probably your best option. Typically fairly competitive to get into with limited spots. 


### So what classes should you take or what alternate path should I take to put myself on the path to becoming an SE?


There is no great answer to this question. Like a lot of things in the SE world ""it depends"" (get used to that phrase, this is a diverse industry with boatloads worth of nuances based on industry/vertical/4000 other things.) The best general advice I can give is ""get good"" at something you are interested in. A lot of SEs will come with CS degrees or similar so that's an easy answer, but not every SE actually comes from a deeply technical background, this author for instance has a degree in Philosophy - but he also was working as a software engineer at IBM while getting his undergrad completed.  
See - it depends. But CS degrees are not a bad choice, they just aren't a necessary choice. You could be a marketing major and up working for a company like Hubspot down the road where you knowledge of marketing will help you connect with your buyers, who are... marketers!  

As to what jobs you should aim for out of college if you want to eventually pivot to SE?  again: It depends but

**Some really good options include:**


Technical roles that build product expertise:

* Software developer or engineer - gives you deep technical knowledge and credibility when discussing complex solutions
* Technical support specialist - teaches you to troubleshoot, explain technical concepts clearly, and understand customer pain points
* Implementation specialist - combines technical skills with customer-facing experience
* Systems administrator or DevOps engineer - provides infrastructure knowledge valuable in B2B sales
 

Customer-facing technical roles:

* Technical account manager - blends relationship management with technical problem-solving
* Customer success engineer - focuses on helping clients maximize value from technical products
* Applications engineer - involves working directly with customers on technical implementations
* Field service engineer - gives hands-on technical experience plus customer interaction


Sales-adjacent positions:

* Sales development representative (SDR) - teaches fundamental sales processes and prospecting
* Business development associate - builds pipeline management and relationship skills
* Marketing coordinator for technical products - helps you understand positioning and messaging
* Product marketing specialist - develops skills in translating technical features into business value

By no means is this an exhaustive list, just some very generalized options. The most common path to SE is not intentional, it's a natural progression of the person who is inherently capable of fitting into the sweet spot of the venn diagram of SE skills that we've mentioned many times now Tech and Soft Skills with Domain Expertise. 


### What about a bootcamp? I see places advertising bootcamps that say I'll make a good 6 figure salary if I take their course?

Personally I despise SE bootcamps and most demo training outfits as well. The rise of SE bootcamps coincided directly with the fall of Software Engineering bootcamps. Which is to say the same assholes who got a whole ton of college kids and adult career switchers to spend their hard earned money on a promise of becoming an SWE with a 6 figure salary in 3/6 months just moved on to the Sales Engineering roles instead because our industry wasn't saturated (yet) with all their poorly trained customers desperate to get a role. 

There was a minute or two where I would have given the Presales Collective a pass, but they have shown to be just as gross as the rest of them. I would likely encourage you to use the PSC as a networking tool but I would not give those bloodsuckers a single dime of your money. 

And while we are on the subject demo training places like Demo2Win are a fucking joke. Here I will give you the entirety of Demo2win's training in two words - but I have to use one of them twice. Ready???

Show, Tell, Show. 

Demo2Win will tell you this like they fucking invented it and it's the big secret to a successful demo. While they aren't wrong that this model is a decent one, it's certainly not magic and it's most definitely not something that they magically stumbled upon. It's a centuries old model that has been used as far back as ""ancient times"" when blacksmiths and sword makers were training their apprentices, it's been used in Military and Educational settings for as long as teaching has been a thing. In short Demo2Win and others of their ilk are a joke. I guess if you literally have no idea how to even do a demo or what one looks like that training would be worth it, but you probably shouldn't be thinking about being an SE if you don't have at least an idea of what a demo should like.

### I'm not technical, can I still be a sales engineer?

Maybe, but probably not. This is job that typically requires you to at least speak ""technical"" and know what you mean when you do so. There are certainly some opportunities out there for SE roles - particularly with SaaS products that are not terribly complex - where you can land that will make sense, but you'll need to bring something else to the table. If you have the soft skills and just need to build some domain knowledge and learn how to speak technically about the industry you want to support take a look at the list in the section above for new grads/college students as potential roles to aim for. These are the same roles you may want to consider to put yourself in a position to potentially transfer into SE roles. Or perhaps you will find when working them there is a different path for you like AE or Product.

### I'm interested in being a sales engineer, what certs should I get? 

Probably none. It's not really a thing in this gig. There are very few lines of work where having certs is going to help you in any material fashion. The exceptions are going to be places like Cisco or AWS or other companies that have their own cert programs. Which is to say if you want to be an SE for GCP, yeah get those GCP certs (architecture certs for instance would be useful in that instance) but outside of those types of places save your time and money for something else, certs aren't the pathway to SE.

### I work in one of the kinds of roles you talk about as being good for transitioning to SE - how do I actually become a sales engineer? 

Good for you and great question. How do you do it? The absolute easiest path to SE is through internal transfer at whatever your current company is. Steps you should take include getting to know the sales team and the existing SE team. Ask the sales managers and the SE managers or the SEs themselves if they think you possess the qualities to become an SE. Ask for opportunities to shadow SEs which is not an uncommon practice, I have new to the company SEs on my calls all the time.

Start thinking in terms of building business/results focused bullet points in your current role that you can add to your CV and use in your conversations with the SE and sales management at your current company. Practice doing demos, and if you can: Get a well respected SE at your company to watch and critique your demo. Ask them to be blunt with their feedback and do your absolute best to hear their feedback with and act on it. There is both art and science to a good demo and there is a lot to take in, their experience will be incredibly valuable to you if you listen and don't take it personally.

If there are no options to transfer internally your current clients, partners, and perhaps most important *competitors of yours* are excellent places to target. It is vastly easier to get your first SE job in the domain in which you currently work. After you get a few years of experience as an SE you can start to pivot to adjacent or even completely new areas but that first gig is almost always going to come from the area you already know and likely from a person you already know. Friends of friends can help too. Networking in your industry is never a bad thing so lean on that network if you can't move internally.

Now that you know how to get the gig...


### What Does a Sales Engineer Actually *Do*?
At its core: **We get the technical win.** We prove that our solution can do what the prospect needs it to do (and ideally, do it better than anyone else’s). Yes, we do a hell of a lot more than that—relationship building, scoping, last-minute fire drills, and everything in between—but “technical win” is the easiest way to define it.

#### A Generic Deal Cycle (High-Level)
1. **Opportunity Uncovered**: Someone (your AE, or a BDR) discovers a prospect that kinda-sorta needs what we sell.
2. **Qualification**: We figure out if they truly need our product, have budget, and are worth pursuing.
3. **Discovery & Demo**: You hop on a call with the AE to talk through business and technical requirements. Often, you’ll demo the product or give a high-level overview that addresses their pain points.
4. **Technical Deep Dive**: This could be a single extra call or a months-long proof of concept, depending on how complex your offering is. You might be spinning up test environments, customizing configurations, or building specialized demo apps.
5. **Objection Handling & Finalizing**: Tackle everything from, “Does it integrate with Salesforce?” to “Our CFO hates monthly billing.” You work with the AE to smooth these issues out.
6. **Technical Win**: Prospect agrees it works. Now the AE can (hopefully) get the deal signed.
7. **Negotiation & Close**: The AE closes the deal, you do a celebratory fist pump, and rinse and repeat on the next opportunity.

### A Day in the Life (Hypothetical but Realistic)
- **8:00 AM**: Coffee. Sort through overnight emails and Slack messages. See that four new demos got scheduled for *today* because someone can’t calendar properly.
- **9:00 AM**: Internal stand-up with your AE team to discuss pipeline, priorities, and which deals are on fire.
- **10:00 AM**: First demo of the day. You show the product to a small startup. They love the tech but have zero budget, so you focus on how you’ll handle a pilot.
- **11:00 AM**: Prep for a more technical call with an enterprise account. Field that random question from your AE about why the competitor’s product is “completely different” (even though it’s not).
- **12:00 PM**: Lunch, or you pretend to have lunch while actually customizing a slide deck for your 1:00 PM demo because the prospect asked for “specific architecture diagrams.” Thanks, last-minute requests.
- **1:00 PM**: Second demo, enterprise version. They want to see an integration with their custom CRM built in 1997. Cross your fingers that your product environment doesn’t break mid-demo.
- **2:00 PM**: Scramble to answer an RFP that’s due tomorrow. (In some roles, you’ll do a lot of these; in others, minimal.)
- **3:00 PM**: Internal tech call with Product or Engineering because a big prospect wants a feature that sort of exists but sort of doesn’t. You figure out if you can duct-tape a solution together in time.
- **4:00 PM**: Follow-up calls, recap notes, or building out a proof of concept environment for that new prospective client.
- **5:00 PM**: Wrap up, though you might finish by 6, 7, or even later depending on how many deals are going into end-of-quarter scramble mode.


### Why This Role Rocks
- **Variety**: You’ll engage with different companies, industries, and technologies. It never gets too stale.
- **Impact**: You’re the product guru in sales cycles. When deals close, you know *you* helped seal the win.
- **Career Growth**: Many SEs evolve into product leaders, sales leaders, or even the “CEO of your own startup” path once you see how everything fits together.
- **Compensation**: Base salary + commission. Can be very lucrative if you’re good, especially in hot tech markets.

### The Downsides (Because Let’s Be Honest)
- **Pressure**: You’re in front of customers. Screw-ups can be costly. Demos fail. Deadlines are real.
- **Context Switching**: You’ll jump from one prospect call to another in different stages of the pipeline, requiring quick mental pivots.
- **Sometimes You’re a Magician**: Duct taping features or rebranding weaknesses as strengths. It’s not lying, but you do have to spin the story in a positive light while maintaining integrity.
- **Travel or Crazy Hours**: Depending on your territory/industry, you might be jetting around or working odd hours to sync with global teams.

### Closing Thoughts
Becoming a Sales Engineer means building trust with your sales counterparts and your customers. You’re the technical voice of reason in a sea of sales pitches and corporate BS. It requires empathy, curiosity, and more hustle than you might expect. If you’re not willing to put in the effort—well, read that TL;DR again.

If you made it this far, congratulations. You might actually have the patience and willingness to learn that we look for in good SEs. Now go get some hands-on experience—lab environments, side projects, customer-facing gigs—anything that helps you develop both the tech and people skills. Then come back and let us know how you landed that awesome SE role.

Good luck. And remember: always test your demo environment beforehand. Nothing kills credibility like a broken demo.

1lfgc1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuperMorbidlyObese/comments/1lfgc1g/200_pounds_down_but_bittersweet/,"200 pounds down, but bittersweet...","Hi there SMO friends! I hit a huge milestone today - I weighed in at 226.6 which means I am officially down over 200 pounds from my starting weight!

I do feel fantastic about this, but...it's bittersweet, for a couple reasons.

First of all, the regulars here will be familiar with my health and surgery recovery saga - that I developed a life-threatening infection last year (not related to my weight, just a random fluke thing, but treatment was complicated by my weight) and eventually needed major surgery, which I had in early February. Leading up to the surgery and as part of my rehab, I've had to be on this extremely draconian, 800-calorie-a-day liquid diet. I initially was told I should be done with rehab and able to transition back to regular food by the end of June - then it was extended to the end of August - and now it's looking like I won't be done with rehab (and this infernal restrictive diet) until sometime in November. There are Very Good Medical Reasons for this that I do understand - but it's still really, really hard as by that time it will have been a year since I've had solid food. Not to mention that it's very difficult to socialize when I can't go out to eat, or even for a drink or coffee. I'm grateful that my recovery \*is\* progressing, even if more slowly than hoped, and that my medical team is still confident that I'll eventually make a full recovery - but it's still really hard to go \*this\* long on a VLCD of liquids only with no cheats, treats or exceptions for any reason.

In addition, for the past year I've had a special man in my life - this was an old friend/lover who came back around after a good number of years apart. At the time he first reached out a year ago, I was a huge mess (completely traumatized from a career implosion and not yet dealing with my weight and health issues) and hence not really in a good place for a full-fledged relationship, so we decided to focus on a ""friendship with feelings"" with the option to progress to something more in the future. He was a huge part of my motivation to get my life together - and I have: lost all this weight, got a fantastic new job, improved other aspects of my appearance, etc. However, he recently ended it with me because he doesn't want to wait anymore (I can't participate in any physical intimacy, not even kissing, during my rehab process, because my surgery recovery is too delicate). It's completely understandable, but - I'm just really sad about it as I've long harbored a fantasy that we would somehow end up together. He doesn't want to be friends anymore or have any further contact and - I'm just feeling devastated that I can't share this latest weight loss milestone with him or any of my future ones. 

I know I just need to be patient and focus on my health for now. That another 5 months or so isn't that much in the scheme of things (particularly as I'll likely lose another significant chunk of weight in that time), and that once I get through this process I'll be in a great place to meet lots of new people - but I'm still sad.

On the bright side - I'd rather be sad (but 200 pounds lighter!) than dealing with all this and still 400+ pounds too. And I do have other great people in my life (family and friends) to celebrate my accomplishments and provide other support. But still...it's all rather bittersweet, as I said.

I am F18 and together with my boyfriend M21 since october. 
He is kind and in general a very calm person, there have been some minor issues lately which basically led to me questioning all aspects of the relationship as a quick check for stuff that I don’t like (not in a weird or unhealthy way, just as a way of thinking “what is good? what is bad? what is okay?” to see how we could improve.). 
Yesterday, as my thinking went on, I inevitably had to think about the following situation which happened around two months ago:
I was sick and feeling bad, but I went over to his house anyway, just to spend time. I will just say everything in detail so people can judge properly.
I had been sick for some days and on friday, I went over to his house. I was sick and just genuinely didn’t feel like having sex, so i said no. I said “no, maybe tomorrow”. And that was it.
On saturday, so a day after, i was still sick but healthier. I went over to his house, but I just genuinely wasn’t in the mood, i just didn’t want to. Not only because i was sick, but because i just didn’t feel like it. Often when i don’t feel like it i just give in when he asks, but that day i didn’t want to. Was I in the wrong for saying no after having said maybe the day before we would have sex?
He had been smoking weed, a habit that i dislike but that’s beside the point. Anyways, after a while, he basically started touching me. I shoved his hands away and said no a couple of times, “i don’t feel so good still” etc, and if i remember correctly i turned around on my stomach just to get away from him and basically try to make him understand that i didn’t want to. After i said “no” maybe like 5 times, I gave up and just let him do what he wanted, because then it would be over quicker and struggling/tensing up just makes sex hurt, I suppose other women know what I’m talking about. Still, i obviously wasn’t into it so it hurt a lot and i assume he was being harsher than usual because he was high, i don’t know. 
I cried a bit while he did it because I felt bad that he didn’t stop. Even typing this out i feel really grossed out by him. However, I don’t know if he saw me crying because I turned my head to the side so he wouldn’t see. After he was done, I just grabbed my phone and locked myself in the bathroom for a bit and thought about what happened and also checked for blood in case I had a tear down there. When I came back, he asked me if i was ok, in a way that i thought was odd and made me wonder if he knew what he was doing and just didn’t care. It wasn’t like a general way of asking if i was ok, but it sounded more like “are you okay with what i did?” even though he didn’t explicitly say it like that, i don’t know how to explain it, it was just a feeling i got.
I said yes and let it go, but i admittedly did google if SA was possible in relationships or if a relationship basically means you can have sex with your partner everytime anyways.
I let it go. I had previously watched a movie about Trump in which he raped his wife. Some hours later, making small talk, I asked him if he thought rape in marriage etc was possible and at which point that could be considered rape. He said that he didn’t know.
Then i simply went home.

I didn’t think a lot about it, I did google occasionally but eventually i stopped because honestly the answer wasn’t what i wanted to hear, since i wanted to convince myself it wasn’t that big of a deal. 

About two weeks ago, after shutting up about it for around a month and a half, i officially noticed that I like my boyfriend less. I think the proper word is resentment. I dislike him kissing me, etc but I never say anything about it because yeah. I’m not trying to be an asshole.
Anyways, I was too scared to talk with him about it in person, and i knew if i kept quiet i would genuinely ruin the relationship with my sadness/ bad mood, so I texted him about it. To that, he said that he noticed I didn’t like it and started thinking about it strongly after the question with Trump and his wife. He said he wanted to bring it up but didn’t know how, so he ended up not doing it. He also said “it’s fine, I think it’s best if i stop initiating sex from now on.” Back then, I briefly rolled my eyes at the response and said “noooo, don’t worry, it’s okay” etc, basically had to pamper him. Back then, so two weeks ago, I was like whatever, now we talked about it, now it’s ok. 

Flash forward to yesterday when I sat down by myself and thought about some issues we’ve been having, and inevitably thought about that situation as well. I have talked with two friends about it. Friend A has extremely high standards in her men and told me to break up with him immediately. Friend B told me to talk about it with him and tell him that while I “didn’t think it was rape, I still felt bad.” Her words not mine, because while I don’t want to call it rape, i do have to be honest and say that it is disrespectful and mean for him to have done that. After I told her that I cried during it etc she stopped saying that and just told me to talk with him asap. I haven’t talked with him about this at all since two weeks ago, and I am 100% sure that he thinks we’re both over it. However, I am now less over it than I was before and thinking about his response makes me angry, because I notice that i had to convince him that what he did wasn’t as bad and he basically completely shifted the attention away from MY situation and MY feelings to his guilt or whatever. This is something that he does frequently, for example we usually stay at his place and I suggested to go to a coffee shop soon to enjoy the warm summer day instead of staying inside, and he responded “we will do it, I don’t want you to think I’m boring” again, shifting everything onto him instead. I didn’t say he was boring etc at all, I literally just said (this is the exact message): Wanna go do something fun soon? Like go to the park, or the coffee shop, so we can spend some time outside since now it’s summer.
Additionally, the more i think about his reaction directly after the act + when i spoke to him about it, I’m unfortunately coming to the conclusion that he 100% did notice that I didn’t want to. And the fact he didn’t even bring it up?? When he knew it might’ve hurt me?? what a pussy.
At the same time I keep thinking maybe he was high and genuinely didn’t hear me, etc. But then why would he be feeling guilty??? Another thing i forgot to mention is that after he did it, he kept asking me if i still loved him like 10x daily. After i spoke to him about the sex situation, he admitted he was asking because he wondered if i didn’t love him because of that (aka. what he did).

Typing this out, i feel angry and disappointed that a good relationship might be ruined because of this. But at the same time, what if i wasn’t clear enough with my boundaries, etc?

Anyways, due to other issues I have forced him to meet me in a park tomorrow afternoon to “talk”. I don’t think he has any idea that I will talk about this. I don’t even know how to start, i don’t even know wether to mention it or not. I am very confused and struggling to see clearly.

I would love to have both perspectives, from men and women. Is this okay, is this normal? Am I overreacting if i feel like shit? Women, would you let a boyfriend or a husband do that and men, would you think it’s okay to do that? I genuinely can’t tell. 🫤

Thank you

tldr: boyfriend “ignored” (assuming he heard and noticed) my “no” while he was high and had sex with me without me wanting to, while i was sick.

I use mid light roasts mostly for espresso.

Today, i ran out of my espresso roast and decided to give the machine a run with my light roast for filter, i grinded a bit finer and started the shot. 20g in, 45g out in 50 seconds (40 seconds since first drop). I was sure it would be very over extracted but for my surprise this was actually the first decent shot ive gotten on my breville. I dont like wasting coffee so i always add milk at home cause the shots have been consistently bad, however today i made the first home espresso that was actually tasty. Wouldnt say it was perfect but it was really good. 

I am happy with the shot but the timing just threw all my preconceptions about how to time shots to the trash. Any tips or comments on the matter? I want to understand better how to be able to dial future coffees and time them.

1lfg65o,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialworkcanada/comments/1lfg65o/feeling_extremely_lost_and_without_value/,Feeling extremely lost and without value,"Hi Folks! 

I apologize in advance for the length of this. I also apologize about how cynical this seems. 

  
Basically, I'm 32(F), and have been working in the social services since 2017. I graduated with a B.A in gender studies and psychology and began working for rape crisis centers, and at shelters for women leaving DV situations. After doing that for about a year, I moved to the U.K and worked as a case manager and harm reduction worker. I decided that I really wanted to go back to school and complete my MSW so I could become a social worker. I did so in 2022. I made the choice to complete my MSW in Scotland at the University of Edinburgh. It was a great experience and I feel like I learned so much. I had great placements and because of my previous experience, I was able to work during my degree, again in case management and project development type roles. I moved back to Canada last year and got my degree accredited with CASW. I'm now registered with the Ontario College. 

I'm really struggling in my career. When I first moved home, I struggled to find work. I was unemployed for a year while living in Toronto. I was applying to more \*entry\* level positions (as an example, outreach support, case management, housing support, etc), which I personally feel I am well qualified to do. I literally could not get a call back from the organizations I applied to. As an example, I think I applied to 4 different positions with the John Howard Society and never heard back. To be clear, some of the jobs I was applying for do not require you to have a BSW, or an MSW, despite this, I was still unable to receive a call back. 

During this time, I was also applying to 'social work adjacent' roles, most were community development jobs with the city of Toronto and some not for profit policy roles... again, I was ghosted in most of my applications. I did not interview for any. I was 'screened out' for 6 City of Toronto jobs. 

Finally, I secured a role with a not for profit in a justice role, again this role didn't require you to be  a registered social worker. I was so thankful to have something and it was a wonderful team. 

Of course, pay at not for profits is not great, so sadly, I had to move out of Toronto and back to my home town due to the cost of living. I was unable to stay in my role after moving out of Toronto. Thankfully, I now have a different role in a not-for-profit as a 'clinical counselor', which is great. I'm so thankful for it, however the pay is extremely low as again, it is a not for profit. I make 58,000 a year. Although, I'm thankful, with my student loan repayment etc I'm really struggling. I also have to commute everyday for the role and there is no milage or gas allowances at work and very limited benefits. 

Without sounding ungrateful, I'm just feeling very confused. I've reached out to social workers in my network to get feedback on my CV and I always hear the same thing ""you're over-qualified and your resume is great"". IDK if I believe that or not, but all I know at this point is that I'm really struggling and feeling extremely discouraged. I thought that moving home to Canada would mean that I would have lots of opportunities but it just doesn't seem like that is the case. I'm not in this field for the money but I guess I'm looking for feedback on whether or not this is normal? When I made the decision to go back to school, I did some research and chatted with other MSWs who were making around 70-80k a year. I feel like I'm extremely far away from ever being able to make what feels like a livable wage. 

I feel so discouraged because I know this work is undervalued in the current world we live in but dang. I tried to buy a coffee this morning on my way to work and my card was declined. I literally have 2.00 in my bank account and I've spent the month supporting victims of sexual assault and violence, it feels like a slap in the face?

I'm kind of wondering how I can continue to do this work if I'm not taken care of. I'm honestly shocked to learn how little people in this field are being compensated. 

I guess I'm looking for advice, feedback? a reframe? Anything. 

Also, I'm aware that some of my work experience is international, but I thought that that would maybe be an asset? Scotland and the UK have great (and very similar) social work practices to Canada and I got to be apart of some amazing projects in the U.K. 

Another thing to note is that I don't have long periods of time in many roles as I have moved around a lot over the last while, maybe that is an explanation?

I have countless trainings in things like CBT, IFS, Indigenous well-being etc, and frankly, when people suggest more certificates or 'going back to school' I feel like that is unfair and I obviously can't afford them. 

I feel like I'm screaming into the void at times and whenever I bring up money, people always say the same thing ""you need to start at the bottom"" and I'm like, ok but when I was a harm reduction worker, responding to overdose everyday in the streets of Ottawa, I thought that was the 'bottom' of the experience ladder. 

I just feel like the time I've put in isn't leading me to any career development opportunities. In the organizations I have been it, there is very little opportunity to even  gain leadership experience. 

Social work is the thing I believed in so whole-heartedly and I came to this field with a lot of lived experience and am extremely hard-working and motivating but this is sucking the life out of me. Is there anyone out there? If you have made it this far, I'm extremely thankful for the time you spent reading.

I used to just rely on my regular cashback card that gave 1.5% on everything, but honestly, I felt like I was leaving money on the table.

So far, I’ve used the SavorOne at a bunch of places—coffee shops, food trucks, Uber Eats, and even a local ramen place, and all of them counted toward the 3% cashback. I also linked it to my Spotify and Netflix accounts, and I was surprised those counted too. The cashback posted pretty quick on my app, which is nice because I’ve used cards before where it took weeks.

The signup bonus wasn’t huge but easy to hit, and I liked that I didn’t have to pay anything upfront just to test it out. I’ve heard some people say the rewards aren’t that amazing long-term, but for someone who eats out a lot and wants to earn a little back from subscriptions, I think it’s doing exactly what I hoped.

Also, to quote the wise, ""if i make a mistake in English please don’t correct me I have no respect for this language ❤️""

Since I’ve joined this subreddit, I’ve been dying to try this absolute legend. Gotta admit that I’m prone to going noseblind really quickly (must be the fact my parents were obsessed with Montale. They used to gift me various bottles for each birthday, starting from age 12, and I think I need to apologize to everyone who hanged out with me and my enormous sillage). 

Anyway, I got a decant of Followed about a month ago. It was carefully packed in plastic, unlike the rest of the decants in that parcel. I had read almost every review on this scent, and was prepared for everything. So, I sprayed it on a piece of paper, and the smell was actually good. Unlike Follow, which smelled like burnt coffee beans to me, this one gave off a caramel cappuccino vibe. I didn’t notice any outstanding projection, but decided it was due to testing a bunch of different perfumes in one go. 

And so this 5ml decant of Followed had been patiently waiting for me to wear it. Today I woke up and chose olfactory violence. Fortunately, the weather was rainy and cold enough for trying out this gourmand bomb. I sprayed like 7 times, including clothes, just to make sure everyone knows when I walk into the room. 

First two hours went quite well. My fiancé and his mother gave no comments on my scent of the day, which was a bit surprising. But I could still smell Followed by Kerosene on my skin and T-shirt, so I felt content with its performance. Four hours passed, I thought I went noseblind, since the scent was barely noticeable. I sprayed 3 more times before going for a walk with my fiancé. He still didn’t say anything about the fragrance, which was kinda disappointing. When we came back home, I asked if he had noticed my perfume today. The answer was no. I made him smell my wrists and neck, and you know what he said? “Smells just a little bit sweet, must’ve faded out already"". It’s only been 6 hours. 

I feel betrayed, heartbroken, devastated even. Wondering if there is something wrong with me, or the people around me, or the perfume itself. Am I living a lie? Is our universe a simulation? If the legendary beast, who was supposed to follow me everywhere, had grown weak and unable to serve its purpose? Just texted my boss I’ll be absent from work tomorrow due to an existential crisis.

Ever feel like you're running on fumes, even after a decent night's sleep? Or maybe you're just not bouncing back as quickly as you used to? We've all been there. It's easy to reach for another cup of coffee or a quick-fix supplement, but what if I told you the real secret to lasting energy and vitality lies deep within each and every one of your cells?

I'm talking about your **mitochondria**. You might remember them from biology class as the ""powerhouses of the cell."" And that's exactly what they are! These tiny organelles are responsible for converting the food you eat and the air you breathe into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP - the energy currency your body uses for literally everything. From thinking to moving, every process relies on healthy, efficient mitochondria.

Now, you've probably seen a ton of supplements marketed for mitochondrial health. And while some can certainly play a role, I've found that the most powerful, sustainable changes come from biohacking your lifestyle, not just your supplement cabinet. This isn't about popping more pills; it's about giving your body the fundamental signals it needs to build stronger, more numerous mitochondria from the ground up.

Ready to supercharge your inner energy factory? Let's dive in.

## Feeding Your Powerhouses: Beyond the Plate

You are what your mitochondria eat, so to speak. While supplements can offer targeted nutrients, optimizing your diet for mitochondrial health goes much deeper than that.

### Quality Over Quantity - Always

* **Whole, Unprocessed Foods:** This is foundational. Think colorful fruits and vegetables, quality proteins, and healthy fats. These provide the essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants your mitochondria need to function optimally and protect themselves from damage.
* **Healthy Fats are Your Friends:** Your mitochondrial membranes are largely made of fat. Consuming plenty of omega-3s (from things like wild-caught salmon, chia seeds, flax seeds) and monounsaturated fats (avocados, olive oil) helps keep these membranes fluid and efficient.
* **Cycle Your Fuel:** Your mitochondria love metabolic flexibility. This means being able to efficiently switch between burning fat and burning glucose for fuel. Intermittent fasting - extending the time between meals - is a fantastic way to train this flexibility. I've personally found that even a 14-16 hour fast a few times a week can make a huge difference in my energy levels and mental clarity. It gives your mitochondria a chance to ""clean house"" and become more resilient.

## Move Your Mitochondria: The Right Kind of Exercise

Exercise isn't just for building muscles; it's a profound stimulus for mitochondrial health. The right kind of movement signals your body to create more mitochondria and make the existing ones work better.

* **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT):** Short bursts of intense effort followed by recovery periods are incredibly effective. Think sprints, burpees, or cycling intervals. This type of exercise creates a demand for energy that pushes your mitochondria to adapt and proliferate. It's like sending them to bootcamp!
* **Low-Intensity Steady State (LISS):** Don't forget the power of a good, long walk or a gentle jog. LISS improves mitochondrial efficiency and can increase their density, especially in endurance muscles. It's the yin to HIIT's yang.
* **Resistance Training:** Lifting weights, using resistance bands, or even bodyweight exercises stresses your muscles, which in turn signals your cells to build more mitochondria to meet future energy demands. Plus, building muscle helps you maintain a healthier metabolism overall.

## Light It Up (The Right Way!): Photo-Biohacking

Our modern lives often disconnect us from natural light cycles, and that's a big problem for our mitochondria. They thrive on the right light exposure.

* **Morning Sunlight:** Getting natural sunlight first thing in the morning signals your circadian rhythm, which is intimately tied to mitochondrial function. Stepping outside for 10-15 minutes without sunglasses can do wonders for your energy and sleep later. I make this a non-negotiable part of my morning routine, even on cloudy days.
* **Red Light Therapy:** This is actually pretty cool. Specific wavelengths of red and near-infrared light can penetrate your skin and stimulate a key enzyme in your mitochondria, improving their ATP production. While you can invest in devices, simply getting more natural sunlight (which contains red light) is a great start.
* **Dim the Lights at Night:** Conversely, avoiding bright artificial light - especially blue light from screens - in the evenings is crucial. Blue light at night disrupts melatonin production and can throw your mitochondrial rhythm out of whack, impacting sleep and repair processes.

## Embrace the Chill: Cold Exposure

This might sound a bit extreme, but controlled exposure to cold can be a potent mitochondrial activator.

* **Cold Showers or Ice Baths:** Even a minute or two of cold water at the end of your shower can kickstart your body's adaptive responses. Cold exposure stimulates the production of brown fat, which is packed with mitochondria, and can also promote mitochondrial biogenesis - the creation of new mitochondria. It's invigorating, to say the least!

## Rest and Repair: The Foundation of Cellular Health

You can't talk about cellular power without talking about sleep and stress management. These aren't direct ""mitochondrial hacks"" per se, but they create the optimal environment for your mitochondria to thrive.

* **Prioritize Quality Sleep:** Your cells, including your mitochondria, do a lot of their repair and regeneration work while you sleep. Aim for 7-9 hours of consistent, high-quality sleep. You might be wondering, ""How does this help my mitochondria?"" Well, without adequate rest, your body is in a constant state of low-grade stress, which drains mitochondrial energy and makes them less efficient.
* **Manage Chronic Stress:** We all have stress, but chronic stress floods your body with cortisol, which can be detrimental to mitochondrial health over time. Incorporate stress-reducing practices like meditation, deep breathing, spending time in nature, or even just regular breaks throughout your day.

## Your Cellular Power-Up Journey

It's easy to get caught up in the latest supplement craze, but true biohacking is about understanding your body's fundamental needs and giving it the right signals. Focusing on these non-supplement strategies - optimizing your diet, moving your body smartly, embracing natural light, dabbling in cold, and prioritizing rest - provides a powerful, sustainable path to boosting your mitochondrial health.

You don't need fancy gadgets or expensive pills to start. Pick one or two of these areas and experiment. See how you feel. I've found that even small, consistent changes can lead to a profound shift in energy, mood, and overall vitality. Your mitochondria are waiting to be unleashed - give them the environment they deserve!",1,1750352456.0,BiohackingLibrary,0,1.0,False

So while me and my boyfriend of 5 years now were in college, we didn’t have a lot of money so we couldn’t afford to get our own place and we were still living with our families separately. He was living with his sister and I was with my parents and brother. Given that he had a his own room and less people in the apartment we spent most of our time at his place (in his room not anywhere else) while his sister was in the rest of the apartment. They are very close in age and she finished college when we were in our 2nd year so its not like she was a very busy put together adult. If anything she was (and still is) one of the most irresponsible people i met in my entire life. The apartment was disgustingly unkept up to a point where i spent every minute she was out cleaning it so it doesn’t smell like rotten food and garbage. She was always drunk, high or hangover and even left the door open (not unlocked, actually opened) a few nights when she came back hammered from the club. We didn’t start off badly, she was even my good friend when i started dating my boyfriend. But she has this bad habit of taking out her frustrations on others in her surroundings when she gets mad - and i mean full on agressive meltdowns with screaming, physical violence and even kicking us out. She hit my boyfriend (her brother) on a few ocassions at which point we were forced to stay with my parents in the same room as my brother due to being afraid for our safety. After the last meltdown happened when she hit him again (around 2 years ago now), I fully stopped speaking with her and I literally haven’t spoken or looked at her since that. Also, it is important to note that every time she fought with my bf she would start being agressive, insulting and just plain horrible towards me as well even though I wasn’t even part of the reason they fought about. The first few times this happened, I still put in effort and reached out multiple times just to be ignored by her. So I gave up after 5+ failed attempts and when the incident I mentioned ocurred, I just didn’t even want to try anymore. Also, I went through some pretty rough stuff (a death) with my family during college which she knew about, but she still chose to kick me out and insult me at every turn. Now, we finished college and finally got jobs (read worked ourselves to the bone working two jobs to save up) and got our own place. We’re really happy (me especially) that we don’t have to be around her anymore. Also, my boyfriend has stopped speaking to her about the time the incident ocurred (other than some necessary topics regarding their living arrangements) and he wanted to get out of there more than anything. But now, he told me she has been calling him and wants to have coffee with him to “catch up”. He’s thinking about going but I just think its a horrible idea as she is known to be very manipulative and I’m afraid she will manipulate him into being on good terms with her again. I feel like a horrible person for even thinking this as she is his family but I just cannot forget all that happened and I really don’t want her to be a part of our loves again as she is the kind of person who just takes and takes offering nothing in return and never offering herself to help. I don’t want her to come see our new apartment, I don’t want her to know about our lives and I don’t want to know about her life. I wouldn’t be shocked if you say I am an asshole for this which is why I really don’t want to talk to my boyfriend about this but if he makes up with her I have no idea how I will deal with this. So, if any of you can understand my position, please give me any kind of advice as I still cannot afford a therapist with the bills and rent.

Back in March, I bought him a gaming computer and all the gear for his birthday. It cost me $1,200 for the computer and $700 for everything else like the keyboard and chair. I had to pay it off over three months, but he was really happy. He got laid off in June and now he stays up all night playing games. From 11pm until 4 am he's literally yelling at his teammates through these thin walls. Whatever game he's playing it is has him screaming ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME"" at 2 fucking am. I have to wake up at 7 for work so I'm not getting much sleep. I used to make coffee at home and bring lunch, but now I'm too tired to do that. I buy coffee twice a day at $4.50 each time and I order food delivery because I can't cook when I get home exhausted.  
This is costing me over $200 extra every month. I even had to take a $25 ride share when I overslept and missed the bus. I bought special headphones which cost me 80 bucks just to help me sleep, but they don't work that well because he's literally screaming his lungs out.

Well, we've officially entered the 6 months of Summer in Florida, which means it's time for me to swap Spotify lists and subject my fellow AC-less car drivers to my musical tastes. And now you! Here's a bunch of random reviews for stuff, plus the song that best represent, imo. (Most of these were actually rested because it's stuff that's been rattling around in my various piles for awhile now.)


☕️**Arcana Gullveig:** _Opening with a thunderbolt of coffee amber (resins of labdanum and benzoin with Arabica coffee and Madagascan vanilla), Gullveig leads you to a heart of cold ice cream and a base of warm lambswool and soft dry spices._ 

Starts out hot and heavy with a dark, roasted coffee note, resinous but a little sweet. I like it fine here but the drydown is so good. Lightly spiced vanilla wool doused in resins with just a hint of coffee. If you liked Vanilas Craves Aurora but wanted a less sugary and more grounded version, this is it! 

🎧 **No Sugar in My Coffee by Caught a Ghost** 

<next track>

🏜 **Nui Cobalt Pangolin** _Vetiver root, iron musk, petitgrain, ancient oakmoss, amber resin, and hinoki wood._

Dry woody notes, my beloved. The oakmoss and petitgrain combine to be strangely reminiscent of galbanum, one of my favorite notes. This is arid, dusty in a desert breeze way. And yet, like most NCD, still remains smooth and cuddly. Absolutely perfect representation of a pangolin, tbh. Throw isn't crazy but I've had people notice it on me from standing next to me. My mom was kinda feral for it tbh. I might have to give her a sample. 

🎧 **Head Over Heels by JD McPherson** 

<next track>

🕶 **BPAL Divinities Implacable, Doom-Laden** _Myrrh﻿, black musk, labdanum﻿, and rose._ 

This is one of my BPAL goats. It starts out in your face and it stays there. Labdanum and syrupy black musk run riot over it, but myrrh and rose hold their own and eventually it evens out into a brash, dark resinous rose. Huge boss energy. I could see Romina or Lady Dimitrescu wearing this. 

🎧 **Riot Rhythm by Sleigh Bells** 

<next track>

🐚 **BPAL The Pearl** _A salt-encrusted﻿﻿ cocoon overflowing with almond blossoms,﻿ sweet patchouli, and dried peony petals whipped into orris butter._ 

Pastel, iridescent salt-dusted florals. This is creamy and softly fruity, with a wind-tossed beachy vibe. Birthed from seafoam vibes. A no brainer summer scent for me. Easy to wear like a favorite t shirt. 

🎧 **Water by Ra Ra Riot & Rostam** 

<next track>

🎸 **Pulp Casati** _Honeyed osmanthus, long-stem red roses, oud, pine bark, & sandalwood musk._

Honey dusted rose over dry, woody, incense. Alluring, mysterious. It reminds me of the Old World Coven in the Underworld movies. Skin-warmed, it becomes more than the sum of it's parts. This is so good, in ways I cannot fully pick apart. 

🎧 **Hush by The Marías**

<next track>

📻 **Pearfat Multiball** _Spilled lime cola, high score bells and chimes, Patchouli, sparking metal, Waxy cedarwood flooring._

This is the scent of a pool hall, minus the cigarette smoke. I grew up spending a lot of time in a pool hall/arcade and this is so nostalgic. Pinball machines, warm wood cabinets, fizzing cola with a twist of lime. Swoon.

🎧 **Magic by The Cars** 

<next track> 

🏖 **BPAL Seule** _Amber-bedewed﻿ skin musk, golden honey, vanilla cream, and a trickle of ﻿sugared lemon._ 

Glistening skin, sweet lemon and a creamy vanilla-honey. This is another easy summer scent. Warm, glowing, sunny. It's one of those skin but better vibes, but beachy.

🎧 **Soledad by La Oreja de Van Gogh** 

<next track>

🏛 **DSH Balls....Said The Queen** _A stone fig leaf accord, like from a Greek or Roman statue, opens the design which gives way to a more warmed and fleshy fig fruit center paired with a salted rose accord.  As the fragrance transitions into the drydown, a rich, fruity, and slightly animalic Oud note emerges along with fascinating facets of olive fruit – olive wood, warm skin musk, and ambergris._ 

Dry, mineralic fig and leaves paired with salty skin musk. This such a neat take on a summer skin scent. I feel like a statue come to life, maybe. Medusa vibes. Unisex, herbal, refreshing. The oud is animalic in a furry way, not the pooud way. Unusual and expensive smelling.

1lffubt,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1lffubt/food_etc_inconsistencies/,Food etc inconsistencies,"I 30f was diagnosed in Feb but have had loads of small symptoms over the years that have led me to wonder if I have multiple things going on. One of them being how certain foods over the years that I never reacted to are now either giving me major digestive issues or neuro and cardio issues with brain fog, lightheadedness and not being able to calm my HR. After I became really ill last year I had to completely stop drinking coffee, but after months I could occasionally have half a cup with milk and powdered collagen/probiotic. I’m realizing how my body is going back and forth so much with eating and drinking certain things because this morning I had not even a half cup of coffee with milk etc and got palpitations, lightheadedness and felt very unwell. I’m lying down with a damp washcloth on my forehead because my face feels hot. This has happened on and off since last year when I first realized I probably had pots after a bout of pneumonia. It’s happening with multiple foods and drinks even my salty go tos like pickles and broth and it’s not always consistent so every day is a gamble. I know I’ve heard of MCAS but I’m wondering if things being wildly different day to day etc is part of it?

1lffu1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1lffu1w/why_choose_cros_laundry_detergent_sheets_review/,"Why Choose CROS Laundry Detergent Sheets Review for Eco-Friendly, Powerful Cleaning?","Testing the CROS CROS Laundry Detergent Sheets Linen Scent has been an interesting experience. As someone who juggles work, a busy household, and a borderline obsession with finding eco-friendly solutions, I found myself intrigued by this compact yet powerful laundry product. Laundry detergent in sheet form might sound like a gimmick, but it’s evident there’s more to it than meets the eye. This product promises to replace bulky liquid detergents and messy powders while being environmentally conscious. Let me share my impressions after putting these to good use over several weeks.

**Design and Portability**  
The portability of these laundry detergent sheets is their most immediate selling point. The packaging is compact and lightweight, making it easy to store in tight spaces or pack for travel. No more wrestling with oversized bottles or boxes spilling powder—these sheets are as thin as paper, which means I can toss a pack into the luggage for our weekend trips without sacrificing other essentials. The pre-measured sheets eliminate guesswork, keeping things tidy and mess-free. Even my kids, who often manage to spill everything, found it simple to use. That said, the minimalist packaging might feel a tad flimsy for those who prefer sturdier options, but it’s a trade-off I’m willing to accept to keep things eco-friendly.  

[Check CROS CROS Laundry Detergent Sheets Linen Scent price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0cl41z1hd/)

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  
At first, I was skeptical about whether these lightweight sheets could handle the kind of messes our household produces—muddy soccer uniforms, coffee-stained shirts, and kitchen towels drenched in grease. To my surprise, they held their own. The sheets dissolve completely in both hot and cold water, leaving no clumps or residue. Even on a cold cycle, my laundry came out delicately scented with the subtle linen fragrance. While the packaging emphasizes the hypoallergenic formulation, I also noticed that they cleaned tough stains effectively without being overly harsh on fabrics. However, for really stubborn stains like ink or grass, I found myself pre-treating before washing, which is something to consider depending on your needs.

**Eco-Friendly Merits**  
The environmental aspect of these detergent sheets is what truly caught my attention when I first saw the product. Reduced plastic waste compared to traditional liquid or powder detergents is a huge win. Not only is the packaging recyclable, but the sheets are also entirely biodegradable. Plus, they are paraben-free, phosphate-free, bleach-free, and dye-free, which is a major bonus for anyone conscious about their impact on the planet. I especially appreciated the low water usage during rinsing; it’s incredible how these sheets foam just the right amount, saving extra rinse cycles without compromising cleanliness. For someone who’s been actively reducing their carbon footprint, this is a standout feature.

**Scent and Allergies**  
The detergent’s linen scent is gentle, and in my opinion, pleasant without being overpowering. My partner, who’s not a fan of heavily perfumed laundry products, had no complaints. I also decided to test the hypoallergenic claims by switching entirely to these sheets for our toddler’s laundry. As a parent constantly on edge about triggering skin reactions, I loved that these sheets didn’t irritate sensitive skin. For those with similar concerns, the absence of harsh chemicals like phosphates and parabens makes this a reliable choice.

**Pluses**  
- Environmentally friendly with reduced plastic and biodegradable sheets.  
- Hypoallergenic formula is gentle for sensitive skin.  
- Compact and light packaging, ideal for travel or tight storage spaces.  

**Critiques**  
- The packaging, although eco-friendly, feels less durable for long-term use.  
- Struggled to remove heavy-duty stains without pre-treatment.  
- Scent may be too subtle for those who prefer more fragrant laundry.  

**Product Comparisons**  
When examining similar products like Earth Breeze and Tru Earth, the CROS detergent sheets measure up due to their lightweight nature and cost-effectiveness. While competitors like Earth Breeze boast a larger sheet count per package, I didn’t notice any significant difference in cleaning performance. However, Tru Earth sheets tend to release a bolder fragrance, which gives them an edge for fragrance lovers. In terms of eco-friendliness, all three are commendable, but the simpler design and precise dosages of CROS sheets save me money by preventing overuse. Meanwhile, traditional liquid detergents feel outdated in comparison, with their bulky designs and unnecessary plastic waste.

**Price Performance**  
Weighing its features against the price, these laundry detergent sheets offer excellent value for money. The fact that each sheet is pre-measured means there’s less waste, stretching the product across the promised 60 loads, and making it cost-efficient. Given how travel-friendly they are, I see this as a long-term replacement for heavy detergent bottles I once carried to laundromats or on family trips. If convenience, sustainability, and safe ingredients are high priorities, it’s fair to say this product delivers for the range.

Stress at work left me feeling completely drained. I should have stayed disciplined with diet and exercise, which would in theory help with the stress, but I didn’t - and I got soft.

7 weeks ago I got my ish back together and recommitted to nutrition, cardio, and bodyweight exercises. Still not as cut as I was 2 years ago, but I can’t believe my progress after 7 weeks.

Nutrition:

I’m intermittent fasting and eating between 4p-9p each day. Start the morning with 5g of creatine with water, then black coffee. Lots of water all day.

Then,  when I break my fast, I focus on vegetables, fruit, nuts, beans, eggs, chicken, and sardines.

I’m averaging 130g of protein per day. I count and don’t stop until I hit 130 at least.

Activity:

6 days of the week,  I do cardio in the mornings from 6-7a. 

Rucking with 30 lb weight vest 2.5 miles 2-3x per week.

Running 4-5 miles 2-3x per week.

I’m doing ~150 pushups per day (in sets of 20-30) in my office whenever I can get in a set. 

Also doing a lot of back stretching, planks, and Superman’s. Again, just throughout my normal day in the office. 

Just starting to get into pull ups (but I can only do 5 in a row right now).

The results after 7 weeks have been super motivating. Can’t wait to see where I am at the end of the summer.

1lffmx0,https://i.redd.it/6hn88ic5yw7f1.jpeg,Troubleshoot dual pressure gauge. [Profitec pro400],"Hi all! This is my first machine, Profitec pro400, it’s less than a year old and I’m stuck. I’ve gone over the userguide and I don’t understand what I’m meant to do to fix things.

A few days ago, the power flipped. Prior to that, when I turned the machine on, after about 15 minutes the top pressure garage would reach 1,5 which is what it’s meant to do (based on my understanding and the guide).

Post the power flip it has not returned to 1,5 but stays at 1.

I’ve tried: -Adjusting the pressure screw at the top and using the blind portafilter and resetting the pressure.

They are the two steps laid out in the userguide.

But like the image attached- the bar is low.

Is there something else to try?

Did I just do things wrong? And just need to try again? Maybe there is a trick I’m missing? 

Does it have an internal fuse (that maybe got part blown in the power surge?)

Do I just need to get it to a technician?

Coffee still comes out when I have used it, so, does it matter if the gauge isn’t going to 1,5?

Is it actually fine and I’m worried about nothing and it’s just different? (Feels unlikely)

Thank you in advance!",1,1750351662.0,esspresso,0,1.0,False

Hello, I have a Ratio 6 I no longer use. You're able to make Anywhere from 500 ml up to 1.5 L of coffee with the various basket holders. 

Special ordered the cone filter holder that takes # 4 Melitta filters, to be able to make smaller batches. The temperature stability is spot on with this, it makes excellent batch brews.

The other day when I was talking to one of the old seasoned fishermen at the pier he was telling me I should get dupont fishing line as he has been using it his whole life and it is great for rigs because of how stiff it is. I’m from asia and it seems very favoured in the region. So far the flouro coated mono leader line ive been using is quite supple and I’ve had low to moderate hook rates with it. When i go online I cant find any info on the stiffness of leader lines with rigs making a difference in bite rates. 

I’m curious to know if anyone has any experience or wisdom with this
Do you guys use soft or hard leaders, is there even any difference? My current leader only tangles when i take it out but never when I’m using it. 


Also I bought the dupont line he recommended and it is so hard to tie i feel like I’m trying to do knots with a plastic coffee stirier. my fingers are red from trying to tighten knots with it",1,1750351593.0,FishingForBeginners,0,1.0,False

I've been lurking around this sub for a while.

I've recently started enjoying exploring the coffee world. I've always loved coffee in general, but the journey started about 1.5 years ago with buying my first moka pot.
Then I bought myself a Kingrinder P2, which has been serving me pretty well.

I've been scounting around for a good offer on a used esspresso machine and today I stumbled uopn this offer. A 15 year old used Rancilio Silvia. Asking price is 300€.
It said to be in good condition and working properly. It was serviced last summer (service bill is presented in the offer). 

Do you all think this is a reasonable price? I would appreciate advice from someone more experienced than myself.

I've heard great things about this machine and I feel like it would be a great entry point into the espresso journey. My worry is the age of the machine, since I don't know what is the life expectancy of espresso machines...

1lffjgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BelleBetting/comments/1lffjgy/0619_belles_pick_of_the_day/,06/19: Belle’s Pick of the Day 🛎️,"\-ARI Diamondbacks v TOR Blue Jays Over 8.5 (-115) | 0.5 Units

‍

**Why This Pick?**

This is another high-scoring affair in my opinion, friends. Kevin Gausman (4.08 ERA) is a great pitcher, but he’s not the Ace he was last season (it pains me to say it – love this dude). On the other side, the Arizona pitching staff is a mess – and starter Ryne Nelson (4.14 ERA) is currently sporting an Away ERA of 7.50. With Toronto’s offense being as solid as it is at the moment and the Diamondbacks eager to avoid a sweep, I say the Over cashes here.

I became pregnant 2 years into our relationship. I have 2 children from my previous marriage; they are in their teens, and they are almost out of the house—no need for him to parent them. He has 3 children from 3 different baby mommas. He only receives a visit from one of his kids, which is only about 20% of the time. We both have F/T jobs. I work 8-4:30, and he works swing and is off @ 11 PM. We split everything down the middle. more or less. Our relationship has always been very turbulent. I will describe him as a traditional misogynistic man. My role includes all cooking, cleaning, all shopping, paying the bills, and watching our son 24 hours a day (except when I'm working, obviously), babysitter pickup, and drop-off. doctor's appt… errands. His duties are working, eating, showering, getting laid, and sleeping. This will make someone be on edge all the damn time (ME). But let's add verbal abuse, such as ""You are a stupid, dumb bitch,"" and physical abuse, such as a black eye (3 times he has hit me), on top of his insecurity that I am cheating on him because I am always too tired to have sex. I have been faithful till this day. He, on the other hand, has had numerous indiscretions, like messaging girls on IG asking if they are single and liking provocative girl pics. Accepting coffee and flirting with coworkers at work. What makes it worse is that we work for the same company. Obviously, it did not begin this way I try to be the best person can be I am grumpy and irritable when I only get 3 hr sleep nightly. Due to our toddler being on a sleep regression.

I actually ordered wholegrain rolls, guess they're out of them. Sadly, you can't choose a jam flavor. I actually only ordered 1 and they both went to waste because I don't like apricot jam. Creamy honey is a smart choice for the hospital, I've only got the runny kind during previous stays and made a mess more than once. Pears in German hospitals are always rock hard, I sliced off what I could and put it on the fake Nutella, tasted good! I forgot to check the milk option on the order form, I can't stand black coffee, completely my fault! 

Lunch: *veggie patty in cream sauce with potatoes and salad, cream cheese cherry dessert* 6/10
I used butter I stashed from last night's dinner and salt my roommate had stashed for the potatoes. The veggie patty had carrot and kidney beans in it, not sure about the rest of it. The sauce around it was gelatinous and bland. The salad was a pleasant surprise, all crunchy pieces of cucumber, carrot and radish. The dessert had gelatin in it like yesterday's, so I didn't eat it 😕

Dinner: *broccoli cream soup, 2 servings of butter, 3 slices of cheese, rye bread, white untoasted toast bread and fruit tea* 3/10
I dunked the buttered (stale, hard) rye bread in the soup, which made it soft enough to eat. The soup wasn't good enough to finish eating it after. I had two slices of cheese on the white bread and drank the tea. Not a satisfying dinner, but better than yesterday. 

If everything goes according to plan, I get to go home tomorrow. I made some changes to my food order, I'll probably be on the lactose free diet for the remainder of my time here. 

I forgot to take my meds from home with me and the hospital pharmacy takes a long time to get orders in, so haven't been able to take about half of my medications in here 😬 Including my sleep meds. Last night was horrible, I don't have much hope for this one. Can't wait to get home! I'll really miss the big, accessible bathroom, though. I've been looking for an accessible apartment for months, but big city real estate sucks.

It’s not just her tone, either. She literally says stuff like, “Ooooh we worked soooo hard on this widdle project just for youuuu!” or “Someone needs a coffee break, yes they dooo!”

At first I thought she was joking. Or maybe mocking someone. But nope. Dead serious. And the kicker? The CEO loves it. Laughs every time. Gives her more praise than anyone else. She got invited to some closed-door strategy meeting last week and came out grinning like she’d just been handed the keys to the company.

Everyone else on the team is stuck between rage and secondhand embarrassment. We’ve started calling her “Corporate Cocomelon” behind her back.

The wildest part? I think she knows exactly what she’s doing.

1lfffe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perempuan/comments/1lfffe2/my_journey_after_learning_stoic_teaching/,My journey after learning stoic teaching,"I used to be a very temperamental guy, because of my upbringing yg di abuse mentally dan physically.
My dad is very traditional, very demanding, very temperamental type if man...
He is a good provider but his resolve to conflict always resort to more conflict!... its like walking on eggshell around him!
He raised me to be like him!.. proud of being a ""jagoan"" and to scream harder if someone scream at me!

Anywae... aku menikah sudah 25 tahun dan akhirnya istri minta separation (tapi belum divorce).
I was so sad and felt that my life falling apart but I keep it together walau deep down inside rasanya ancur lebur.
Menjalani therapy: hypnotherapy, psychologist sampe psychiatrist which cost me almost $5000.

I felt better and learn to love myself and stop the blame game.
Get interested with stoic teaching and re-learn how to be a man and unlearned everything I know about my dad version of ""how man supposed to be""

Go back to the separation... me and my wife decided to sleep in different room.
Still being civil to each other and not having physical relationship for almost 1 year now.

After I learn about these stoic teaching (and my therapies) I realised that I've never grew up!
I am 48 y.o man that act like 12!
So, I start adapting stoic principles in my everyday life.
The one that really change everything for me is:
- control what you can control
- lets agree to disagree

I found peace, self love and self control
Lots of my friend making a comments that I look younger, lebih kinclong, lebih wibawa (krn skrg sudah jauh lebih tenang)
One comment from a friend: "" lo beda banget ya, lo jauh lebih diem tapi ""presence"" elo berasa banget walopun lo gak ngomong""
That makes me wonder... do inner peace affected people more than your physical presence?

Met a few women for a date but I rejected any physical/sexual request from them because I dont want to hurt people (eventhough Im separated but not divorced yet)
Just meet for a coffee or lunch.
I hold their hands and hugs during the date but no kisses.
One girl that I meet in thailand during last dec holiday, flew all the way to australia (without me knowing) to spend her holiday with me...
I treated her as a friend but rejected her offer to accompany her to spend the night in her hotel.
She smile but I can see that she started to develop feeling for me.
 Funny thing, my wife started to complimented me on my changes.
Finally, one fine day she said she still love me!
She said, she's amazed with my transformation!
After 1 almost 1 year of separation finally we are back to sleep in the same room again!

BUT!!!!!

I've changed!
I've grown!
I... don't need her anymore!
I feel so guilty!.... I still love my wife but not like I used to!
I don't ask for her approval like I used to
I don't need her validation like I used to
I don't need her to take care of me like I used to
I don't need her beside me like I used to
I BECOME VERY INDEPENDENT!

Now... we are back together as husband and wife... but we are different!
We've grown!
Time will tell if these changes will make us or break us!

For almost a year, eventhough I have a few advances dari beberapa cewek... not even once I slept with any of them.
Sometimes I wonder.... krn I gak perduli dgn kata ksetiaan dan dosa!
Tapi kenapa gak ada pikiran mau sleeping around!
Mungkin terlalu terbebani dgn traditional value of marriage.
My wife nggak ada kontak sama laki laki lain, malah I yg banyak kontak sama cewek lain...

I jadi ingat, dia dulu pernah bilang ""aku tau kamu itu orangnya seperti apa, aku tau isi otak san hati kamu""
Mungkinkah setau itu dia tentang aku?
Jadi dia ga pernah kuatir kl aku jatuh ke pangkuan cewek lain.

Tapi sekarang kita pisah kamar lagi...
Bukan separation, tapi kali ini krn kita gamau denger suara ngorok masing masing...

I prefer happy endings, but may put up with less-than-happy endings if a favorite actor is involved (like Goblin). And I also enjoy mystery and thriller shows. My absolute favorites are: Healer, Her Private Life, Crazy Love, Hometown Cha Cha Cha, and Squid Game.

After many tweaking these days, I saw amazing improvements when introducing a swirl after the first and second pour, although I believe swirling after the first one should be enough (haven't compared this side by side).

What I think was happening is that because this is the first time I have a brewer with percolation my pouring technique is crap and I wasn't getting my coffee bed fully saturated, so I was getting a lot of channeling. Once I introduced these swirls all bitterness dissapeared and the flavor notes finally appeared. And I'm using a Timemore C3 at 17 clicks, which is not a high end grinder so it produces many fines.

okay so this is absolutely insane and i'm sitting in my car outside a police station right now trying to figure out how my life got this messed up.

my husband works construction and he's gone like 12 hours a day. we've been married 8 years and honestly things got boring. he comes home exhausted, we barely talk, and our bedroom life is basically nonexistent. i know that's not an excuse but i'm trying to give context here.

about 6 months ago i started texting this guy from my yoga class. nothing serious at first, just complaining about our marriages (he's married too). then it got flirtier. then we started meeting for coffee. you can probably guess where this is going.

here's where it gets really bad. my husband is super paranoid about me cheating. like he'll randomly come home early sometimes or ask weird questions about where i've been. so i got this genius idea to put a GPS tracker in his work truck so i'd know exactly when he was coming home. that way i could time my ""meetings"" perfectly and never get caught.

i bought one of those magnetic GPS things off amazon for like 50 bucks. stuck it under his truck bumper. worked like a charm for about 2 months. i always knew exactly where he was and when he'd be home.

last tuesday i was at yoga guy's apartment when my phone showed my husband's truck moving toward our neighborhood way earlier than usual. i panicked, threw my clothes on, and raced home. got there like 5 minutes before he did. thought i was so smart.

but when he walked in the door he was holding this little black box. the GPS tracker. my stomach just dropped.

""care to explain why this was on my truck?"" he said super calm which was somehow scarier than if he'd been yelling.

i tried to play dumb. ""what is that? i've never seen it before.""

he pulled out his phone and showed me the amazon order confirmation. it was sent to my email. i'm an idiot and forgot to delete it.

""so you've been tracking me,"" he said. ""why?""

this is where i made the worst possible choice. instead of confessing about the affair, i panicked and said ""i thought you were cheating on me. i was trying to catch you.""

he stared at me for like 10 seconds. then he laughed. not a happy laugh. a cold scary laugh.

""so you put a tracking device on my vehicle without my knowledge because you thought i was cheating. that's rich coming from someone who smells like another man's cologne right now.""

i started crying and tried to deny it but he just shook his head.

""pack a bag. you need to leave. tonight.""

i begged him to let me explain but he wouldn't listen. said he was taking the tracker to the police in the morning because what i did was illegal stalking. i laughed and said ""you can't call the cops on your own wife for trying to catch you cheating.""

apparently i was wrong about that.

this morning two officers showed up at my sister's place where i've been staying. they arrested me for stalking and criminal surveillance. apparently in our state putting a GPS tracker on someone's car without their permission is a felony even if you're married to them. who knew?

i've been released on bail but i have court next month. my husband filed a restraining order too so i can't even go to our house. he's already talked to a divorce lawyer.

the worst part is he knows about the affair now. yoga guy's wife found out somehow and called my husband. told him everything. so now everyone knows i'm a cheater AND a stalker.

my family is split. my mom says i brought this on myself and should have just divorced him if i was unhappy. my sister thinks he's being vindictive by pressing charges. my dad won't even talk to me.

i know cheating was wrong but i feel like he's destroying my entire life over what was basically just me being a worried wife. yes i was actually cheating but he didn't know that when he found the tracker. from his perspective i was just a suspicious spouse trying to catch him in the act.

so reddit, am i the villain here? yeah i cheated and that's awful but does that really justify him getting me arrested and potentially giving me a criminal record? couldn't he have just divorced me like a normal person?

I planted my first rose tree this year. She was very healthy when I bought her. I bought local from a very reputable nursery that grows all of their own roses from seed. 

I’ve done everything I know - I planted with the same soil mix that I’ve always used - Black Kow, Peat moss, dirt from the hole and bone meal. Fed coffee grounds, egg shells weekly. All of my other bushes are thriving but the tree. Not a new shoot - nothing. Still green but literally nothing. 

Any tips or advice? I’ve been growing roses for years and this is my first time with a tree.

Just sharing my thoughts here in case you're in the same boat.

First, a few words on what I take/don't take into consideration in choosing my gyms:

* I mainly do bodybuilding, so I care a lot more about machines and weights than classes
* I spend my WFH days at the gym, so I want the place to be near cafes, (fitness friendly) restaurants, supermarkets, barbershop, etc
* When are the peak hours, peak days; How crowded is it during peak times
* I don't use PTs so don't really care about that

With that out of the way, here are my thoughts on some of the gyms around Jaksel:

\---

# Fitness First Platinum (Lotte Kuningan)

For those of you unaware, there are two tiers of Fitness First gyms. Platinum is the more premium one, while Premium is the lesser one. What I like about FF Platinum gyms:

* Workout attire is provided! (Towels and toiletries too) To my knowledge no other gyms provide free rental t-shirt/pants. It's super convenient to not have to carry around spare clothes, towels, toiletries.
* Free coffee (it's bad but still free)
* Large floor to ceiling windows meaning lots of natural light
* Premium malls so easy access to supermarkets, foods, etc

What I don't like:

* Poor machine variety, not many benches in the free weight area
* Old LifeFitness machines don't feel nice
* Office area so super crowded after work hours

Around 600k/month, but you get access to other FF/Celfit gyms in the area (e.g. signing up at FF Lotte Kuningan gets you access to FF Mega Kuningan, Celfit Kuncit, Celfit Kokas; FF PP gets you Celfit FX).

\---

# Fitness First Premium/Celebrity Fitness (PIM, Gancit, Kuncit Kokas)

Since Celfit is the sister brand of FF, I consider FF Premium in the same tier as Celfit. What I like about them:

* They're all in decent malls so easy access to supermarkets, foods, etc
* Some have multiple of the same machines, so less likely to have to wait for others

What I don't like:

* Mainly LifeFitness/Hammer Strength machines, which are fine, but can be better
* Can be super crowded after work hours

Around 400-500k/month. Honestly idk why anyone would sign up here if they could just sign up at a Platinum FF gym, and still get access to these FF Premium/Celfit gyms.

\---

# Anytime Fitness

So apparently AF's business model is to have locations inside office buildings, so they can be super convenient if you work in the same building. What I like about AF:

* Access to gyms overseas

What I don't like:

* Old LifeFitness machines just don't feel good
* Super crowded after work hours
* Each location is usually super small in size
* Not close to supermarkets usually
* 24hr access to all AF branches is kinda a gimmick? Since most of the locations are inside private office buildings anyway

Around 500k/month for 24hr access to all AF branches globally.

\---

# Osbond Gym Corbuzier Series (Fatmawati)

Osbond is the largest local gym brand, and for some of their locations they apparently partner with Deddy Corbuzier? Honestly idk the difference between the Corbuzier series ones and the non-Corbuzier ones. What I like about Osbond gym:

* They just updated their machines! The new Infinite machines feel pretty good
* Really good machine variety (especially for legs): the only place I've found a pendulum squat, belt squat, lying hamstring curl
* Access to a nice supermarket in the mall
* The only place that gave a special offer for ex-Gold's Gym members like me

What I don't like:

* So many machines can make the space feel cramped, especially during peak hours
* Crowded after work hours and weekends
* Poor healthy food options in the mall

Around 250k/month for ""single"" gym option, which allows you to visit other Osbond gym locations (but not Osbond Lite) 3 times a month. There's also an ""all-access"" option, which gives you unlimited access to all locations (including Obsidian gym in Bali apparently).

\---

# Osbond Gym Lite (Cilandak)

A recently-added type of Osbond Gym, and different from the normal/Corbuzier gyms. What I like about Osbond Lite:

* They have some Panatta machines which are the Ferraris of gym machines imo
* They have unique machines like vertical leg press
* The only gym I've found where the treadmills actually connect to the internet (can browse YouTube/use Spotify from the treadmill itself, rather than from your phone). Other gyms either don't have smart treadmills, or have smart treadmills but just don't connect them to the internet.

What I don't like:

* Small and super cramped
* Super crowded after work
* The supermarket in the mall doesn't have a butcher section, so no fresh protein

Around 250-300k/month, and you get unlimited access to other Osbond Lite gyms (most notably in Dukuh Atas). You can also visit other normal/Corbuzier series Osbond gyms up to 3 times a month.

Those are all the gyms I visited. Hope this helps!

\---

**End notes:**

* I didn't even consider FTL/Fithub cos they don't have easy access to supermarkets/cafes, unlike mall gyms. Feel free to drop your own review of FTL/Fithub
* I asked for the longest membership period at each place. The membership cost might be slightly more expensive if you don't go for the longest membership commitment.",2,1750350823.0,sehat,0,1.0,False

Melitta was a German housewife who loved her coffee. “My mother, who had an excellent taste in coffee, was often irritated by the grounds in her cup,” recalled her son, Horst Bentz.","Not only that, Melitta became increasingly frustrated over having to clean the copper pot and getting rid of the grounds that stuck like mud to the sides. Her days were spent trying to find a more efficient and cleaner way to brew. After going through a series of experiments, she was able to invent the paper coffee filter using the torn-out pages of Horst's schoolbook. She stuck it inside her tin pot, added coffee grounds, and poured hot water over it, which dripped through the paper. The paper filter was then tossed into the trash along with all the wet coffee grounds. She described the whole process as “perfect coffee enjoyment.”

In 1908, she received the patent for the paper filter from the Imperial Patent Office in Berlin and went on to establish her own company, basing the headquarters in their Dresden apartment. She then became the employer of her husband at a time when women weren't even allowed to vote.

Today, the Melitta Group employs more than 4,000 people all over the world and, in 2017, reported revenue of 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion).

Please be forward and ask any questions you want answered. Currently looking for friends with benefits, not just sex. We are open to couples, females and males. We've had other accounts on reddit but we've been away from the lifestyle for a year or two. All current pics and stats are on this account. We are both still exploring sexuality and could be open to both straight or bi people. We want to find friends that can be more than just bed playmates, we've done all the crazy sex stuff and want more substance this go around. We have recently focused on traveling, we would really enjoy travel friends. We are also getting back into fitness and would love someone who can work out with us or be generally an outdoor person. We live near the water and are big on any kind of water related activities. We've done a tri and some half marathons, anyone who runs or bikes would be amazing! We don't usually drink but don't care if you do. We enjoy all kinds of body types and are more attracted to chemistry. We're very 420 friendly and will share!

OK if you made it this far here's the cheat sheet for you. 
1. Don't be a dick. 
2. Be honest. 
3. Be ready to meet for coffee shortly after chatting. (We realized if we don't meet within the first two weeks most convos just die off) 
4. Be clean of any STIs 
5. Be available for fun nights occasionally but be available for fun adventures more. 
6. Be in stable headspace and understand we only want friends with benefits at this time. Not looking to change our current relationship and we are not looking for any other relationship commitments at this time. We have a family, careers and travel. Those three take priority, in order, over any fun we want to have.

1lff373,https://www.reddit.com/r/maleinfertility/comments/1lff373/what_worked_for_me/,What worked for me,"Hi All,

I figured I'd make this post just because this community is amazing and I was able to get a lot of help and support from here. My wife recently tested positive and I wanted to share what steps I took to be able to achieve that. Suffice it to say that 90% of the things that I did were sourced from this sub directly (do your own research and consult your doctor of course)

Me and my wife had been trying since 2023. In 2024 when we still weren't successful, we both got tested. Her results were perfectly fine, but mine were not the best.

**Test 1 - June 2024**

***Vol*** \- 2ml

***Concentration*** \- 25 million/ml

***Progressive motility*** \- 25%

***Total Motile*** \- 35%

***Morphology*** \- 5% normal

Now these weren't bad results, but they were at / below the threshold. For example, the total motility was supposed to be 35% and I was at 30%. I did some digging on where these metrics were coming from, it turns out its just the 2.5th percentile from a WHO study that takes 1000 partners who conceive in a year. [Link](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030787) Additionally it turns out sperm parameters have been declining in the past few years [Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10890002/) [Link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi8oL_Z2P2NAxWxXmwGHUuUJxMQFnoECDEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMale_infertility_crisis&usg=AOvVaw0czOX7eHJ5L8gNsSDIU4vF&opi=89978449). So, what was like a 1 percentile in 1970 is probably a 20 percentile in 2025! 

A few days later, I took another test to be sure

**Test 2 - June 2024**

***Vol*** \- 1ml

***Concentration*** \- 20 million/ml

***Progressive motility*** \- 26%

***Total Motile*** \- 30%

***Morphology*** \- 1% normal

This time we took a consultation as well. The doctor wasn't too concerned about my sperm parameters, saying that its borderline but he's still seen pregnancies with these parameters. I had started looking at things online about how to increase sperm parameters and I mentioned those to him, he dismissed it saying its all BS and there's nothing you can REALLY do about it. Not knowing whether to be dejected or not, we tried to conceive naturally for 5 months after that. I should also mention, during this time I was going through a really stressful time at work. This involved 16-hour days, with copious amounts of coffee and a really unhealthy diet to boot. I probably gained like 20 lbs during this time. I was eating oily greasy food, whatever i could get my hands on plus not sleeping too well. Anyways, after 5 months of trying unsuccesfully, we decided to go in for another consultation and this time the doctor convinced us to get an IUI done. The parameters had gotten worse  
**Test 3 - Nov 2024**

***Vol*** \- 2ml

***Concentration*** \- 30 million/ml

***Progressive motility*** \- 11%

***Total Motile*** \- 15%

I was completely dejected. I couldn't figure out why my parameters were bad to begin with and also continuously declining. We did the IUI anyway which was unsuccessful. Again, the doctor had nothing to say but your parameters are fine and you can probably get better just through assisted reproductive techniques and keep trying (even hinting at IVF in the future). That was supremely unsatisfactory. Looking for answers I stumbled across this sub and was probably on it for a good 4-5 hours the first day.  A lot of people had parameters similar to mine and some worse than mine. But what was a recurring theme was that male infertility can be cured (to some extent) with supplements, lifestyle changes and some intervention. 

**Supplements-**

There was this magic supplement I kept coming across in a lot of posts - **CoQ10 enzyme**, a lot of people had reported taking this and it improved their parameters drastically. **Selenium through Brazil nuts** was another one. Some other ones that I kept seeing on different posts were **- Zinc. Lycopene, Carnitine Tartrate, Omega 3 Fatty acids, Ginseng.** There's a bunch of medical publications on the impact of each of these on sperm parameters like count and motility, I went through some of them and there was a positive correlation. Additionally, these were supplements, so I saw no harm in taking them. So, I started a daily regimen of CoQ10 enzyme 300 mg twice , Trazer Forte M twice (which has some of the supplements mentioned above), Brazil nuts, Multi vitamin tablets. I couldn't find a strong correlation for every ingredient listed in these supplements, but I took from whatever product was available in my country. Another interesting thing that I came across in the medical publications was that it seemed only motile sperm (which is a product of total count and the motility %) is a good predictor of fertility. Other things like morphology were not that really strong predictors. Although head defects did seems to have a negative correlation with fertility esp. in cases of assisted reproductive techniques (lesser the head defects the better)

We continued to try naturally, but this time we also changed fertility doctors, coz we were going nowhere. This time the doctor asked us to test again

**Test 4 - Feb 2025**  
***Vol*** \- 2ml

***Concentration*** \- 30 million/ml

***Progressive motility*** \- 11%

***Total Motile*** \- 15%

  
More dejection. I didn't know what I was doing wrong. Although I did know that a lot of changes/cures for sperm tend to kick in 3-6 months after you start doing it, so i was still hopeful. This time our doctor was a little more helpful and did suggest we go after these fertility enhancing supplements along with lifestyle changes that might help. She also suspected a possible varicocele, but i had that test done and it was a grade 1 varicocele with no intervention required

  
**Lifestyle, diet changes and further supplements-**

Around this time, desperate for help, me and my wife joined a tele-health startup sort of thing, where they advised people on how to naturally boost their fertility. It was a mix of diet, exercises and ayurvedic supplements with reviews from people that this actually worked. I should point out , that at this time I had a much easier time at work where i wasn't working 16 hour days , or stuck in traffic inhaling cadmium and lead for 1-2 hours per day. Some of the things I started doing basis their advice- 

1) Avoiding coffee or tea

2) Working out regularly 3 times a week

3) Wearing loose fitting clothing

4) Avoid nonveg food completely. Restrict to whole wheat/ multi grain foods, leafy vegetables, and lentils for the most part to reduce inflammation in the body. My digestion improved significantly after this and i felt much more energetic

5) No more hot showers. It was hard at first but now I am used to a colder shower

6) Stop medication that was causing rhinitis. I was a chronic user of antihistamines for my perennial cold. I found other ways to manage it and stopped taking that as medication

7) Additionally I started taking more ayurvedic supplements namely - [Haridra Khanda](https://www.netmeds.com/health-library/post/haridrakhanda-benefits-uses-ingredients-method-dosage-and-side-effects?srsltid=AfmBOoppAVGAN4tOEUTeqWXAWpHJeUQgjQxPORiOgJ5QxQWL3hTszQkm), [Kaunch pak](https://www.sevasadan.in/Kaunch-Pak-125-g/p/116?srsltid=AfmBOoq74hKgm5Zh3nmuwgeQfbdPx3Add7jhps7QcKU4paWhL8No4kFS).

I continued to take the allopathic supplements mentioned above in addition to these new lifestyle changes and ayurvedic medicine. 

**Test 5 - April 2025**  
***Vol*** \- 2ml

***Concentration*** \- 74 million/ml

***Progressive motility*** \- 44%

***Total Motile*** \- 53%

Me and my wife were absolutely overjoyed! Every parameter had increased significantly. I couldn't believe my eyes, but it was true! I am not sure what one effort helped increase the parameters, but I strongly feel it was a combination of all of them.

So much so that when we went in for a consultation and showed our semen analysis history, the doctor was incredulous, even challenging the test rig the analysis was done on! In any case we continued to try naturally for the next 3 months. Even so , our doctor suggested an IUI to move things along quickly. I was really confident that we could conceive naturally, but we did need to consider age and other factors and decided to do an IUI for which there was another test done at the same center (also to prove to her that my sperm had in fact improved)

**Test 5 - June 2025**

  
***Vol*** \- 1.8 ml

**Closing Thoughts**

It was quite the year since I did the first semen analysis; i was dejected at first, but there is absolutely 100% measurable ways in which your situation can get better and this sub is living proof of that. I'm not sure where I'd be without this sub. So i just want to say a huge thank you to the mods, the contributors all of you who have shared your experience; you have no idea (or maybe you do!) the positive impact you are having on other peoples lives. Thanks, and keep doing what you do. Hopefully I was also able to contribute to this awesome community",8,1750350334.0,maleinfertility,2,1.0,False

1lfeysh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfeysh,Restoring coffee table - no idea what type of wood! Help?,"I am working on restoring a coffee table that’s been in the family for a few decades. I’m at the point where I need to decide on stain and finishing, but feel like I can’t make the right decision without knowing what type of wood I’m dealing with. Maybe someone here can be wood detective and help out please? 🕵️‍♂️ it’s pretty lightweight, I added 4 pictures. 

I have also had no luck in determining who made this table. All I’ve got is the engraving in the photo, which reads “A.V.F. TH 4188” The table was purchased in 1987/1988 in western Massachusetts, but I don’t know if it was purchased new, at an antiques shop, or what.

Thanks folks!",1,1750350040.0,furniturerestoration,0,1.0,False
1lfeyeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lfeyeb/furniture_store_delivery_driver_fell/,Furniture Store Delivery Driver Fell,"I ordered a coffee table online and paid to have it delivered inside of my home. When the delivery drivers arrived they carried it up the three steps to get onto my porch. There were no tripping hazards present and the porch is new and free of any issues. It's also the middle of summer and the porch was dry and no ice was present. When the delivery driver who was coming up the stairs backwards reached the top step he fell and hit his bottom pretty hard.
He got back up, the coffee table table was undamaged, and his coworker even laughed and said that was his second time falling this week. They delivered it and left, but I was left mortified, and was wondering if he had hurt himself worse, would his job or my home owners insurance be liable?",1,1750350013.0,Insurance,3,1.0,False
