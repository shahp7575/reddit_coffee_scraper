## key Features Analysis

The market for tea dispensers is diverse, with models ranging from simple hot water dispensers suitable for tea bags to refined devices that brew tea leaves with precision. Below are core features to consider when choosing a tea dispenser.**Water Temperature Control:** Accurate and adjustable temperature control is crucial for optimal tea brewing.

Many tea dispensers offer pre-set temperature options tailored for different tea types, such as green tea (around 175°F), white tea (around 185°F), oolong tea (around 195°F), and black tea (around 212°F). Some advanced models allow for fine-tuning the temperature in one-degree increments. Maintaining the correct temperature ensures that the tea extracts the optimal flavor without becoming bitter or losing delicate aromas. Digital displays and intuitive controls further enhance user experience.

**Brewing Time Adjustment:** Precise brewing time settings contribute to the perfect cup of tea.

Tea dispensers equipped with adjustable brewing time settings allow users to control the strength and intensity of their tea. Shorter brewing times result in lighter, more delicate flavors, ideal for green and white teas, while longer brewing times are better suited for robust black and herbal teas. Some dispensers offer pre-programmed brewing cycles for different tea types, making it easy to get consistent results. Users can typically adjust brewing times from a few seconds to several minutes, depending on their preferences.

**Loose Leaf Tea Compatibility:** Dispensers designed for loose leaf tea offer superior brewing capabilities.Models designed to handle loose leaf tea typically include a built-in infuser or tea basket. These infusers are often made of stainless steel or glass to avoid imparting any unwanted flavors to the tea. Some dispensers feature automatic infusers that lower and raise the tea basket into and out of the hot water at the optimal time, ensuring even extraction. The size and design of the infuser also influence the quality of the brew, with larger infusers allowing for better water circulation and fuller flavor extraction.

**Water Filtration System:** A high-quality water filtration system improves the taste and quality of the tea.

Many premium tea dispensers incorporate water filtration systems to remove impurities such as chlorine, sediment, and heavy metals from tap water. These filtration systems typically use activated carbon filters or multi-stage filtration processes. by using filtered water, the true flavors of the tea are allowed to shine through.Some dispensers also feature indicators that alert users when the filter needs to be replaced, ensuring consistent water quality.

**Capacity and Size:** The water tank's capacity and overall size of the dispenser are meaningful factors for different households.

Tea dispenser water tank capacities vary significantly, ranging from small models suitable for individual use (around 1 liter) to larger models ideal for families or office settings (3 liters or more). The size of the dispenser itself is also critically important to consider, especially if counter space is limited. Compact designs are available for smaller kitchens, while larger dispensers may require more dedicated space. Consider the number of users and how frequently tea is consumed when determining the appropriate capacity and size.

**Programmable Settings:** Customizable programmable settings let users automate their tea brewing routine.

Advanced tea dispensers often feature programmable settings that allow users to customize their brewing routine. These settings can include pre-set brewing times, temperature preferences, and automatic start times.For example, users can program the dispenser to brew a pot of tea every morning before they wake up.Some dispensers also offer multiple user profiles, allowing each individual to save their preferred settings.

## Core Benefits

A tea dispenser offers several compelling benefits over conventional tea brewing methods. From improved consistency to enhanced convenience,a good tea dispenser can transform the way you enjoy tea.**Improved Consistency:** A tea dispenser ensures repeatable brewing parameters, leading to consistent flavor and strength. This eliminates the guesswork often associated with traditional methods,where variations in water temperature,steeping time,and tea quantity can significantly impact the final result. With a tea dispenser, you can consistently brew the perfect cup of tea, every time.**Enhanced Convenience:** A tea dispenser simplifies the tea-making process, saving time and effort. Instead of boiling water, measuring tea leaves, and monitoring steeping time, you simply fill the dispenser with water and tea, select your desired settings, and let the machine do the rest. This is particularly beneficial for busy individuals or those who enjoy tea throughout the day but don't have the time for traditional brewing methods.**Optimal Flavor Extraction:** Temperature and time control features make tea taste much better. Modern tea dispensers are equipped with precise temperature and brewing time controls, allowing you to extract the optimal flavor from different types of tea. By using the correct temperature for each tea variety, you can prevent bitterness and maximize the release of the tea's aromatic compounds.Adjustable brewing times allow you to control the strength and intensity of the tea, ensuring a perfectly balanced and flavorful cup.

**versatile Functionality:** Many tea dispensers also function as hot water dispensers, suitable for coffee, instant soups, and other hot beverage applications.

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right tea dispenser involves considering several factors. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions to help you in your decision.

**What type of tea is best suited for a tea dispenser?**
Tea dispensers can be used with a variety of tea types, including loose leaf tea, tea bags, and even tea pods. The choice depends on your personal preference and the capabilities of the dispenser. Loose leaf tea often provides a richer and more nuanced flavor, while tea bags offer convenience and ease of use.

**How frequently enough do I need to clean a tea dispenser?**
The frequency of cleaning depends on usage and water quality. As a general guideline, it's recommended to clean your tea dispenser every 1-2 weeks to prevent mineral buildup and maintain optimal performance.

Regularly cleaning the infuser or tea basket is also important to prevent clogging and ensure proper flavor extraction.**Can I use a tea dispenser to make iced tea?**
Yes, many tea dispensers can be used to make iced tea. Simply brew a concentrated pot of tea using the dispenser and then pour it over ice. Some dispensers even have dedicated iced tea settings that automatically adjust the brewing parameters to create a stronger, more flavorful tea that won't taste diluted when poured over ice. You can also add flavorings such as lemon, mint, or fruit to customize your iced tea to your liking.

**Is a tea dispenser energy-efficient?**
Modern tea dispensers are designed with energy efficiency in mind. Many models feature insulated tanks that help maintain water temperature, reducing the need for frequent reheating.

1llsgun,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1llsgun/i_dont_know_if_i_took_my_tylenol/,I don’t know if I took my Tylenol,"I recently started a trial run on a medication that causes terrible headaches and muscle pains.  

I do really well on it if I take two extra strength Tylenol with breakfast.

I don't have a routine set yet for it - it's only my second day adding the Tylenol.

So I have no idea whether I've taken my Tylenol.

I was going to take it with my coffee.  I had the bottle sitting there.  I have a vague memory of holding the bottle and dumping out two pills.

But that memory could be from yesterday.

I tried picking up the bottle and opening it to see if it felt immediately familiar in the moment.

It felt heavier than I remembered but also I feel strongly that I took it already.

I can't take a double dose safely.

Unlike my prescription meds, I can't count how many pills are left in the bottle and know whether I took it.

My routine with daily meds is usually to use a pill organizer - but this is a new situation.  This would be the day I would have put the pills in the organizer having established the routine.

I know I should have set the designated dose aside last night.  My tired brain forgot how to think after a brief power outage changed my night time routine.

This is my least favorite part of ADHD.  I don't form a memory of doing a small task like this if I do it on the fly while distracted by something else.  No memory at all.

It's the reason I have to have only one place to put my keys and sunglasses.  It's the reason I have to have backups of everything everywhere I might use them.

I have a pair of scissors in every room of the house and at opposite ends of the kitchen.

I maintain two back ups of every consumable at all times - two backups of body wash, two backups of shampoo, two back ups of face wash (It took a long time to build some of the skincare backups and makeup up because it's hard to buy extras of something more pricey than body wash). 

I wear hearing aids, so batteries are in my purse, my kitchen drawer, and my car.

We renovated our house, and now we have a really great functional entrance/exit area by the back door when we used to only use the front door when we left the house because of the way the kitchen was configured.  

But I still use the front door a lot - so now I either have to have two sets of keys and two sets of all the things I used to keep by the door, or I have to never use one of the doors.

My keys are always by the door I'm not using.

I don't have my wipe off board I used to use in the kitchen because there's nowhere to hang it because my husband wanted cabinet door panels for the fridge, so no more magnets.  This has made me incredibly off kilter for the last nine months because I spent over 14 years using a dry erase board and a dry erase calendar on the fridge to manage my life.  

I've really got to find a way to hang those things without damaging the walls my husband doesn't even want people to touch because I'm going crazy without a solid home base for my brain.

And now I'm just waiting to find out if I'm going to get a migraine because I still don't know if I took my Tylenol.

This is actually my first server – up until now I've been brewing into a regular drinking glass. 

The coffee is a Colombian natural Pink Bourbon, https://lacabra.com/products/las-palmas-2?srsltid=AfmBOopfZjGr9oUFtdvKbdLTkBxcLprQTp8hwUFiI6UvtQEb1xDLIc5D&showBanner=false&lastClicked=1751025775051, that seems to have sold out by now a few days after the order. 

What's your experience with coffee by La Cabra? Regarding resting, they say at least ten days on their site, but I assume it's way longer for this one since it's a dense coffee (grown at 1700 masl). 

As a Swede it's fun trying other Nordic roasters. I normally buy coffee from Gringo since their coffee is awesome + that the roastery is located in my city. ",0,1751026848.0,pourover,0,0.5,False

Instead of taking my card, running it, and handing it back like every other drive through situation, the barista has to steady the card reader while I try to insert it. Of course it doesn't go in all the way so we have to apply force on both sides while awkwardly laughing. Then of course ""it's going to ask you a question"". The question, of course, is how much do I want to tip, which the answer is nothing because  I'm already paying too much for an overpriced drink. Of course the default is set to 20%, which I have to manually change. Even though she is telling me I need to push the arrows, I instinctively try to push the screen assuming it's a touch screen. Then I try to hit the arrows but I hit the wrong direction at first and then finally give up because this is taking too long and not worth the dollar and the humiliation ritual.

1llsa7z,https://i.redd.it/jj5cbma5og9f1.jpeg,Supercharger Rates,"I’ve mostly been charging at home and work since I took delivery last October. 

Last week I needed to head down from Northern NJ to Lewes DE for my mom though and ran into some annoyances. First she has a wawa right by her home that I knew has superchargers from when I had my Model 3 but after trying to use them with the Rivian we found that they were “Tesla only”. I didn’t think that was even a thing but after plugging in and not getting it to work we saw a sign that said as much. This location also didn’t come up on my dashboard app. Instead the dashboard was navigating me to another wawa a few towns over. 

Not the end of the world but pointing out that apparently not all superchargers work with Rivian. Apologies if this is common knowledge but it was a first for me anyway. 

In Bear DE we charged no problem. It was fast. I got some delicious Wawa coffee and we moved on. But the annoyance here was the price. I was charging up at around 1130am on a weekday and it ended up costing about $20 more than the same % charge I did at another supercharger closer to home in NJ on another day. Are electricity rates in DE really that high compared to NJ???  When I supercharged in Jersey it was around 1030a also on a weekday. Has anyone else noticed wildly fluctuating prices like this?

Minor gripes. I love my R1S and am very happy with it as is my family. 

Next time I visit my mom tho I’m not filling up in DE.

1lls84z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bangkok/comments/1lls84z/working_american_time_zone_but_want_to_make/,Working American time zone but want to make friends,"Hi y'all. I'm a software engineer living in Bangkok near the Hua Lamphong BTS stop. Because of my work schedule (8pm - 5am ICT) (20:00 - 05:00) I've found it tricky to get out during the week and make friends. 

I'm curious if anyone has any recommendations of where I could hangout and meet locals given my awkward schedule 😅. I'm lucky enough to be able to work where I want so I was thinking of checking out some co-working spaces or coffee shops? But my hours make that complicated lol.

I'm a bit of a nerd who's also into punk and DIY music so I'd love late night places I can work at or day time places into nerdy stuff like records, coffee, guitar; hobbies like coding, board/tabletop/video games.

I don't really drink alcohol so bars aren't my first choice but I wouldn't exclude them either. I'd love to meet anyone and get to know what it's really like living here and what kind of subcultures there are.

I'd also love to meet fellow coders so if anyone knows of any meetups or hacks that'd be a dream ☺️

p.s.  
Felt really selfish writing this but I'd love suggestions from people who might have similar parameters and maybe even this thread could help someone like me in the future <3",2,1751026103.0,Bangkok,1,1.0,False

I’ve been off work for almost a month and a half, wearing a figure of eight clavicle brace for the last four weeks since the orthopedic doc I saw a diagnosed me with the injury. 

This occurred because I dropped forward onto my hands from my knees.  I have a history of hyper mobility and ankylosing spondylitis so I get all the weird stuff.

I can’t carry a coffee cup from one room to the next without it subluxing out of place, reaching overhead to wash my hair when I can is exhausting, and shoulder flexion above 90 while seated puts it out of place.

My primary symptoms when it shifts out are severe vocal hoarseness, and becoming extremely lightheaded.

I started PT per the ortho referral while I’m waiting for a thoracic surgery consult. 

The PT I’m working with has been in practice for 30 years, however, my symptoms are so severe that at this point in time, he does not feel comfortable with doing anything more with me than manual, dry needling, and laser therapy.

Has anyone ever had a referral for this injury before?

1lls4jq,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1lls4jq/real_interview_questions_when_did_hiring_get_this/,Real interview questions - when did hiring get this weird?,"I've been tracking some of the actual interview questions job seekers are getting asked this year, and honestly, I'm starting to think some companies have completely lost the plot. These aren't hypotheticals or made-up examples. These are real questions from real interviews.

**""On a scale of 1 to 10, how honest are you?""**

What exactly is the correct answer here? If you say 10, you sound like you're lying. If you say anything less than 10, you're admitting you're dishonest. It's a trap question that serves no purpose except to make the interviewer feel clever. I asked a friend who got this one what they said, and their response was ""My greatest weakness is that I'm too honest,"" which at least got a laugh.

**""If all the animals in the world overthrew humanity, which species would become the leader?""**

This was for a customer service role at a mid-sized insurance company. The interviewer was dead serious and waited for a thoughtful response. My contact spent five minutes explaining why dolphins would make good leaders because of their intelligence and social structures. They didn't get the job. Probably for the best.

**""Would you rather listen to an annoying laugh for a whole day or get tickled for one hour straight?""**

I'm not even sure what this is supposed to reveal about someone's work style or qualifications. The person who got asked this said their first thought was ""Would you rather listen to an annoying laugh for a whole day? So basically, work in an office?"" They kept that comment to themselves.

**""Describe the color yellow to someone who's never seen color before.""**

This one showed up in an interview for a project manager position. While there might be some logic around communication skills, the interviewer then spent ten minutes critiquing the candidate's answer and suggesting ""better"" ways to describe yellow. The whole thing felt more like a power trip than an assessment.

**""If you were a kitchen appliance, what would you be and why?""**

At least this one is straightforward in its absurdity. The candidate went with ""coffee maker"" because they help people start their day and keep teams energized. The interviewer nodded seriously and wrote notes. They got a second interview, so maybe there's something to the kitchen appliance strategy.

Here's what bothers me about this trend: these questions don't test creativity, problem-solving, or cultural fit. They're just weird for the sake of being weird. Good interview questions should help both sides figure out if there's a match. Questions like ""Tell me about a time you had to solve a problem with limited resources"" or ""How do you handle competing priorities"" actually reveal useful information about how someone works.

These random hypotheticals mostly just test how well someone can improvise an answer to something completely unrelated to the job. And honestly, that's not a skill most roles require.

I've noticed this happening more frequently over the past year. Companies seem to think asking unusual questions makes them innovative or helps them find ""creative thinkers."" But there's a difference between assessing someone's thought process and just being bizarre.

The worst part is how these questions put candidates in an impossible position. You can't really prepare for them, and there's no way to know what the interviewer actually wants to hear. Some candidates try to game it by giving answers they think sound creative or insightful. Others just try to get through it and hope the rest of the interview goes better.

What really gets me is that while companies are asking about animal hierarchies and kitchen appliances, they're often skipping the questions that actually matter. They're not asking about the candidate's experience with the specific challenges they'll face in the role. They're not discussing career goals or what kind of support the person needs to succeed. Instead, they're burning interview time on questions that would be more appropriate for an icebreaker game.

I've started telling people that if an interviewer asks something completely off the wall, it's okay to pause and ask how it relates to the position. Most legitimate questions, even creative ones, should have some connection to the job or the company culture. If the interviewer can't explain the relevance, that tells you something about how they approach hiring.

The job market is tough enough right now without candidates having to navigate interviews that feel like improv exercises. Companies complain about having trouble finding good people, but then they waste everyone's time with questions that don't help them identify the right fit.

Remember, interviews go both ways. You're evaluating them just as much as they're evaluating you. And if their idea of a good interview question is asking what animal would rule the world, that might tell you everything you need to know about working there.

What's the strangest interview question you've been asked? I'm genuinely curious if this is as widespread as it seems, or if I'm just hearing about all the weird ones.",1,1751025792.0,resumes,1,1.0,False

I met this guy on Bumble a little while ago. We vibed instantly, and after a few days of chatting, we met up for coffee. The date was really good — genuine conversation, laughter, good energy. We both left smiling, and I actually felt hopeful about where it might go.

A few days ago, he messaged me saying he missed me. I replied with something sweet aww cutiee, and the next day I playfully asked, Do you miss me again today?
His reply?

I miss you but you don’t.

I didn’t love that comment, but I replied, Who said I don’t?  To which he said you didnt say i either and I replied I thought you were smart enough to figure out. 

And then… he just vanished.

I’m confused like why would someone say they miss you, and then vanish when you show warmth back? 
I like him.I don’t want to chase or look like I have no self-respect, but I also genuinely want to know if he meant any of it. Part of me still wants to reach out again. The other part feels stupid for even caring.

Few things I noticed about him :

1.I think he is used to attention.
2.He was being super mushy saying he wants to see me again, he thinks of me etc.
3.I called out one of his flirty messages jokingly (“tall claims, babe haha”). I am wondering if that turned him off?
4.He’s seen/ignored my message since last night, and I’ve already double-texted him before.

So:

1.Why would someone say they miss you… and then ghost when you respond warmly?
2.Is this ego, mind games, or just low emotional maturity?
3.Is it ever okay for a woman to make another move? Or would it now come across as desperate?
4.Should I just let it go and assume the silence ?

1lls1uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/micahwrites/comments/1lls1uu/past_owners/,Past Owners,"**GHOST HUNTERS WANTED. NO EXPERIENCE NEEDED.**

That was what sucked me into all this, that stupid ad. They even used the Ghostbusters logo. Totally illegal, sure, but it’s a Facebook ad and who cares, right? The familiar logo caught my eye, the text made me laugh, and I thought, “Sure, why not?” And I clicked their stupid ad.

“Past Owners,” that was the name of their show. Well, “show.” It was going to be a YouTube channel. You know the shtick: going into haunted properties, talking up the murderous history, getting excited every time there’s a squeak or a draft. Keanna was convinced that she had a new angle, though, nothing to do with ghosts at all. Her hook was SEO and targeted marketing. She was fresh out of some ad school and full of ideas about how to reach untapped markets and build a following.

Her idea was this: even people who don’t care about haunted houses in general care about haunted houses in their town, right? People like hearing about themselves, and their hometown is enough a part of themselves to scratch that itch. Keanna was sure that through keywords and location-specific ads, we could pitch each episode of our show to locals, people who weren’t already burned out on the whole ghost-hunting thing.

I was skeptical, but she was offering a regular paycheck and it sounded like fun, if nothing else. The “no experience needed” in the ad was because she’d already lined up her camera guy and tech folks. All she needed was a gofer to do—well, everything else.

I had one big question for Keanna before I joined up. “Do I need to believe in ghosts for this?”

She laughed. “Definitely not. Only Emmerich does and—nothing against him, but we don’t need two Emmerichs around here, that’s for sure.” 

So I signed on as van driver, cord-carrier, coffee-getter and general stuff-doer. The team was small: Keanna, Merete, two guys named Jeff, and Emmerich. Everyone seemed genuinely pleased to have me on the team, and I was happy to meet all of them. Especially Merete, who was smoking hot. She was the one who was going to be in front of the camera, so it made sense. Plus she had this accent—man. Definitely convinced me that Keanna was going to be able to sell this show, that’s all I’m saying.

The Jeffs were in charge of the cameras. Everyone called them Stand Jeff and Sit Jeff to tell them apart. Stand Jeff was the guy who worked the standard camera, the kind you carry around to film people with. Sit Jeff dealt with all of the remote cameras. His whole deal was run from a control center, keeping tabs on a dozen different screens at once. Different skill sets, both camera-based, both named Jeff.

I asked Stand Jeff if we could call one of them by their middle name or something, and he looked disgusted.

“Yeah. You could. Except that his middle name IS Jeff.”

“Wait, he’s named Jeff Jeff?”

“No, he’s named Mark. He goes by Jeff just to tick me off. He won’t even respond to Mark now. If you don’t call him Jeff, he just pretends that he didn’t hear you.”

“Well, do you have a middle name?”

Stand Jeff looked offended. “Screw that! I’m not letting him steal my name. I was Jeff first.”

And then there was Emmerich. Everyone else was mid-twenties, I’d say. Maybe thirty for Stand Jeff. But Emmerich had to be fifty, and a hard-worn fifty at that. He was a happy guy, always smiling, but he looked like he’d spent his entire life outdoors and only found out about sunscreen last week. His skin was weathered and wrinkled like a broken-in baseball glove. His hair was close-cropped and bristly. He looked kind of like Malcolm McDowell, only if he were a walnut.

Emmerich was responsible for all of the weird tech. EMF meters, infrared stuff, Geiger counter, defibrillator, regausser—don’t quote me on the names of any of this, he lost me like six words in—whatever weird stuff might pick up a ghost, Emmerich had it and knew how to use it. Between his hard-sided cases and Sit Jeff’s banks of computers, the twelve-passenger van barely had room for the six of us to sit.

“You think this stuff can really pick up a ghost?” I asked him.

“Another skeptic, I see.”

“I mean, yeah. People die all the time, everywhere. I really think I would’ve seen a ghost by now if they existed.”

“Perhaps you have. Not all hauntings are equal, you know. Haven’t you ever felt someone watching you when you were alone? Or suddenly had your mood shift for no reason?”

“Those are your ghosts? They’re gonna make for some pretty lousy TV. ‘We were walking around in the dark, when this man suddenly became creeped out! Ooooooh!’”

Emmerich was unfazed by my mockery. “Some ghosts are minor. Some are major. If we’re lucky, we’ll find something in between. If we’re not, my equipment is good enough to pick up even the minor ones.”

“So the show might just be you pointing to a meter and explaining that this spike was a phantasm?”

He shook his head vehemently. “Trust me, we see a phantasm, you won’t need any explanation from me. Like I said, not all hauntings are equal. Your standard phantom, that’s just a lost scrap of a person. You might not even know it’s there without serious equipment like mine. Temperature changes, tingling sensations—that’s about as far as a phantom can go.

“A phantasm, now, that's a full-fledged evil location. It's a space-bending, time-dilating, hallucinatory murder waiting to happen. Phantasms are sentient and sadistic. They will lure you in, chew you up and swallow you whole. You spot a phantasm, you drop everything and run. If you still can.”

Emmerich was staring me dead in the eyes. I opened my mouth to make a joke, but nothing came.

“Check,” I said instead. “Gotcha. Noted.”

I didn’t get it, of course. But then again, Emmerich still came along, so maybe even he didn’t really get it then.

\--------------

It was our very first location. Keanna had found this amazing place outside of town, a full-on mansion called the MacDermott house. It had some kind of intense past, a hundred and fifty years old since Old Man MacDermott murdered his whole family and stuffed himself up the chimney, ghost haunted the attic and stared out the window forever, I don’t know. I wasn’t listening. I mean, I was listening, but Marete was reading and so actually I was just listening to her accent and imagining other words. I kept the van on the right side of the road and got us to the MacDermott house without incident, so whatever. I think I did fine.

The setup went like setups do. Emmerich and Sit Jeff and I hauled heavy stuff into various locations around the house and ran cables as inconspicuously as we could. Stand Jeff got a bunch of shots of the outside of the house, and then filmed Marete talking about the history of the place. Keanna helped Sit Jeff get everything up and running, supervised Stand Jeff’s camerawork for a bit, and then probably took a nap or something. I don’t know what producers do. She wasn’t helping me haul equipment, that’s all I know.

Once everything was set up, we all ditched and went out to a nearby pizza joint to get dinner. Keanna wanted to wait until sunset to get started, so we ate dinner and cracked jokes until dusk, then headed back to the house.

Sit Jeff parked himself behind his display of monitors and declared that everything was rolling and ready to go. Stand Jeff and Marete took a thermometer and an EMF meter and wandered off to film in various rooms. Emmerich had me grab some of the more esoteric machines and follow him off to take soundings or something. Keanna was off on her own, I thought at the time. Looking back, it was probably already too late to save her.

Emmerich and I were down in the basement when my walkie crackled to life.

“—ere are you guys?”

“Basement. Camera...four?” I flashed my light up at the wireless camera we’d fixed to the wall earlier, reading the tag. “Yeah, four.”

“No w—” The walkie cut in and out erratically, fizzing with static. “—hing there but—”

I waved my light at the camera again. “See the bright light? That’s us.”

Nothing but static came from the walkie, so I took a picture of the camera and texted it to Sit Jeff.

Moments later, my phone buzzed with a response. It was a photo of the camera banks, centered on the monitor labeled CAMERA 4. It showed an empty basement room, the same one we were in.

I glanced over at Emmerich’s machines, which were completely silent. Emmerich was tapping on the walls. Both of us were completely visible to the camera.

*Ha ha*, I wrote back. *Earlier picture. Very funny. Text me if anything’s really going on.*

On the walkie, I said, “Basement’s looking quiet. Stand Jeff, Marete? Anything up where you are?”

“Come up,” said a voice on the walkie. It didn’t sound like either of the Jeffs, and it definitely didn’t sound like Keanna or Marete.

“Jeff? That you?”

“Come up.”

I looked over at Emmerich, who shrugged. “Nothing down here,” he said.

We were almost out of the basement when Emmerich paused.

“How many stairs were there on the way down?” he said.

“I don’t know. Like, ten? Twelve?”

“There are thirteen now.”

“Okay, so it was thirteen. What, is that an unlucky number of stairs?”

“I don’t think there were thirteen on the way down.”

“Man, if there are thirteen stairs on the way up, there were thirteen on the way down. That’s how stairs work.”

“There weren’t thirteen,” he said mulishly, shaking his head. I sighed and pushed past him.

The ground floor was quiet. I thought about shouting, but something held me back. Instead, I reached for the walkie again.

“What room are you guys in?”

“Come up.”

“Upstairs, then? We’re back on the ground floor.”

“Up.”

“Thanks, man. Helpful.” I turned to Emmerich. “Up, then.”

He looked concerned. “I want to swap out some of the equipment.”

Back in the main room, the chair in front of the bank of monitors sat empty. Emmerich and I exchanged glances.

“Sit Jeff?” I said into the walkie. “Where’d you go, man?”

“I’m with the others. Come up.”

“All right,” I said uncertainly, eyeing the monitors. I couldn’t see anyone on any of the screens. “Emmerich’s just grabbing some stuff.”

“Come up and join us.”

“Okay, yeah. We’ll be right up.”

I flinched as Emmerich pressed a small box into my hand.

“What—” I started to say, but he pressed two fingers to my lips. For the first time since I’d met him, he wasn’t smiling. He tapped the box in my hand, which had a post-it note on it.

\**TURN THIS TO MAX,*\* it said. The box had a single dial, like a car radio knob. It had two rubber antenna sticking out of the top, and its back was a single speaker.

I gave him a questioning look. “If you need to,” he told me. “Not before.”

“I don’t thi—”

Emmerich put his fingers to my mouth again. With his other hand, he pointed down the unlit front hallway.

In the gloom, at first I couldn’t see what he was pointing at. Then, with a shock, I realized:

The front door was gone.

The large wooden door, with its half-circle of leaded glass above and rectangular window panes down either side, was no longer there. Instead, the hallway terminated in a small alcove with a chair, lamp and end table. It would have looked like quite a cozy reading nook had I not known that it should have been the way we entered the house.

“Emmer—” I tried, but he pressed his hand against me harder, mashing my lips into my teeth.

The walkie crackled to life again. “Come up.”

“Let’s go up,” Emmerich said. He held up a box identical to the one he’d handed me and looked at it meaningfully, then back at me. “They’re waiting for us.”

Together, we walked up the house’s narrow staircase. I counted the steps this time. There were thirteen.

The stairs let out into a dark hallway lined with doors. Every one was closed. An aura of menace hung in the air, an almost palpable sensation. I could feel it settling into my lungs with each breath.

I tried the first door. It was locked. Emmerich tried the one across the hallway, with the same result.

I glanced back downstairs. The steps stretched away into blackness, far beyond the reach of my light.

“Up,” said the walkie.

At the end of the hallway, a set of folding stairs led up to a gaping hole in the ceiling. I cast a pleading glance at Emmerich. He gripped his little plastic box and walked toward the stairs. With dread in my heart, I followed.

The attic was dusty, black and silent. Our lights barely seemed to pierce the air, illuminating mere feet in front of us. A splintery wooden floor stretched out beneath overhanging beams. Boxes and discarded furniture were strewn erratically about.

“Oh, good,” said a voice. It came from the walkie, but also from above, behind and all around us. “You’ve come to join us.”

The walls heaved, then, spitting out a darkness with tangible form. I dove for the stairs, fully willing to crash headlong down them, but instead skidded off of bare wooden planks. Laughter echoed as I scrambled to my feet, searching desperately for an exit that was no longer there.

Behind me, heavy footsteps thumped across the floor, and static crackled. “Wha—no! No!” shouted a facsimile of Sit Jeff’s voice, and I whipped around but saw nothing. Instead, a hand caressed the side of my cheek and I heard Marete’s soft voice in my ear. “We’ve been waiting for you.”

A rough hand grabbed my other shoulder then, spinning me away. “Up! Move!” shouted Emmerich, pulling me to my feet. He dragged me across the attic, our footsteps drowned out by the cacophony of voices calling out from around us. Phantom hands grasped at my arms and clawed at my face, but Emmerich’s presence was more solidly real than any of them.

“Was there an attic window?”

“What? I don’t know! Maybe?”

“Think!” Emmerich towed me in a circle, the attic closing in around us. When we had first come up here, it had stretched out in every direction. Now, we were tripping over boxes with each step, and I could see all four walls with a sweep of the light. “When we pulled up, did you see a window? A dormer on the house? A circular pane at the top? It doesn’t have to open, it just has to be there. Think!”

The walls were closer now, no more than two steps away. They were closing in, forming a coffin. “There’s no window!”

There were no windows. There were no doors. There was no escape.

“Not *is*. Was! *Was* there a window?”

“I don’t—” And then a scrap of memory caught my attention, a piece of the house’s history that Marete had been reading in the car. The ghost had been seen in the attic window. I was sure of it, sure she’d said it. “Yes! Yes, toward the street, an attic window!”

“Then run!” And with that, Emmerich shoved me away from him, dropping his flashlight to twist the dial on his little plastic box to the max. As feedback squealed forth at an ear-shatteringly painful volume, the walls around us wavered, and for just one instant I could see moonlight streaming through a window.

I charged for it, twisting the dial on my own box high. A tortured electronic scream shrieked forth, holding back the walls as I dove bodily into the window, smashing through it into the wide open night, twenty-five feet above the ground.

I don’t know how I survived the fall. The ground was soft enough, and I landed just right, I suppose. If you count three cracked ribs, a broken ankle and a broken elbow just right, anyway.

I do. I didn’t even feel the grinding bones until I was back in the van, jamming the keys into the ignition and slamming my broken ankle onto the accelerator to get away. And even then I didn’t stop until MacDermott house was miles behind me and my body was screaming at me to stop and rest.

That was almost a month ago. I don’t know what happened to the others, not exactly. I saw Emmerich at the end, as I tumbled out into the air. He looked stretched, broken, his limbs bent into unpleasant angles and his skin pulled taut until it was starting to tear in places. But it was the look on his face that is seared into my mind, a look of horror and hopelessness and horrible comprehension, all blended into one. It was the look of a man who knows in terrifying detail everything that is about to happen, and understands that knowing will not make it hurt any less. I wonder if he knew he was saving me at the cost of himself—or if he thought that the window was the other direction, and was attempting to offer me to the house as he flung himself to safety.

I don’t sleep much any more. Minutes at a time, maybe half an hour if I’m lucky. Or unlucky, perhaps. Because every time I sleep, I’m back in the MacDermott house. Voices taunt me, bubbling up from the darkness. Hands grasp at my body, pulling me back. Hallways stretch away as I run down them, lifting doors out of my reach. And always, always the whisper:



\**Did you really think I’d ever let you go?*\*



I think I made it out in time. I remember the glass cutting my skin, the impact with the ground. I can feel the hard casts on my arm and leg, bite my finger for the pain, pick away a scab to see myself bleed. I’m sure that I’m here.



But then again, that’s exactly the sort of hope the house would want me to have.

1lls1je,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelblog/comments/1lls1je/best_places_to_visit_in_july_in_india/,Best Places to Visit in July in India,"I have done quite a few trips in July and honestly, it’s one of the most underrated months to explore India. If you don’t mind a bit of rain, here are some places I’d personally recommend:

* **Valley of Flowers, Uttarakhand** – Only open for a few months and July is when it’s at its most stunning. Endless carpets of wildflowers and lush green mountains—totally worth the trek.
* **Meghalaya** – This place comes alive in the monsoon. Waterfalls everywhere, and the clouds rolling over the hills make it feel otherworldly. Cherrapunji and Dawki are must-visits.
* **Coorg & Munnar** – For misty hill vibes, coffee/tea estates, and peace. Just pure green everywhere.
* **Leh-Ladakh** – July is one of the safest months to visit, with all roads open. Did a road trip last year and it’s still one of my favorite memories.

It's classic comfort food: lots of meat, creamy sauces, potatoes, and always dessert, as well as coffee and cake right before we leave. The food is good, so that's not the issue. But we meet often. It's not just one indulgent night here and there. It's 2–4 high-calorie evenings every month. I know that potatoes are not high-calorie themselves, but the rest of the meal is.

I'd like to eat lighter when we’re together, but it's difficult, because there are barely any vegetables on the table. If I don't eat the rich food, I go hungry. More importantly, in my culture, saying no to food often comes across as antisocial or rude.

When I host, I serve vegetables (as well as meat, potatoes, and sauce), and people eat the veggies, but it hasn't inspired the rest of the family to do the same. I don't want to tell others what to serve, but I'm struggling to balance my health goals with family dynamics.

* Have any of you been in a similar situation?
* How do you handle social meals where you feel pressure to eat a certain way, or where your needs aren't really met by the food that's served?
* Have you found diplomatic ways of declining second servings or dessert?

A basic Wiki is now [here](https://slimwiki.com/ragnaroknrol-limited/getting-started/welcome).

**May 5**

It’s Sunday. The rush is over, time to clean up and get stuff ready for the order. Jackie is in the lobby, bussing tables and talking with guests. She treats both our human and our inhuman visitors the same. Makes me happy seeing everyone get along and her be a source of that.  
She’s wearing a frilly skirt that sways when she struts. It lifts up a little when she bends over. *I wonder what color… DERAIL*  
Jackie fumbles and then gets the cups off a table.  Klutzy as ever.  She comes over. “Hey boss lady.”  She seems happy to be doing this. I am happy to let her. Since she and I started doing this Sunday shift the sales have gone up over 10%. I’d be an idiot not to notice that it was all her.  Especially with all the guys watching her.  
She passes Doctor Gupta.  He waves at her, and she walks over, bows to him, kisses him on the cheek, and checks to see if he wants a refill.  That doctor has free coffee for life here.  He has become one of the Sunday regulars.  He still thinks he witnessed a feat of adrenaline and fury that is spoken of in urban legends when I snapped a metal fence post with my bare hands to get her down.  It was part of my domain, I told it to let her go, it did, but he doesn’t need to know that.  He also tells her that he still wishes he could have seen the miracle that followed in the ambulance.  She tells him it was all me. 

I really need to find that EMT.  I know he has shown up.  Lemar served him once and when he tried to pay, he got really surprised.  Said he “I don’t deserve it. The brunette literally yelled at her until she came back.”

I don’t know how to take that.  It kinda sounds mean of me.

Mundane doorbell chimes ring out.  Human walking in. I look and see if it is Mark. Confirming it is him, I wait for him at the counter.  “Usual?”  He smiles and nods. I get his usual.  
“Grande Americano for Mark.”  Normally I might have used Marky Mark or some other variation, but something has been telling me not to mess around with him and I listen to those instincts.  
He grabs his drink and heads to a table that lets him see almost the entire room.  Jackie heads back to the counter and I watch him follow her with his eyes again.  
“Heeeeeee’s back.”  I say.  She chuckles.  
I shake my head at her. “You going to take him up on his offer?  You have wanted to see a Broadway show since you first moved here.”  
“I know, but there are some issues.”  
I shake my head at her. I am trying to be a supportive friend and roommate. I am worried. She has been really sad lately.  I know she is happy when she has someone she is close to.  The last one she had was Tailor, kinda, a guy that was not good enough for her.  I mean, cheating on her by not clearing it first at a Fae wedding reception with a nymph?  How rude!

*This guy has money, dresses well, seems to have a good head on his shoulders, and isn’t even smelly.  Even if not a good match, he can show her a good time, spoil her, and distract her. I don’t want her obsessing.  She still seems to have the occasional nightmares about dying. I can hear her crying out every now and then when she’s waking up. That’s dangerous*. *She also seems to be depressed about something and has been since Cindy and Ricardo left our happy home. I am so worried about her.*  
She looks at me, lost in thought, and smiles. “You know what, I have wanted to see one. So why not go on a date?  Might be fun.”

I smile as she goes off to see him.  Good for her. It isn’t until she is talking to him that I notice her smile doesn’t touch her eyes…  
He smiles big and grabs her hands in his. I cheat a little and listen in. “Thank you. Can I ask why you finally said yes?”  She giggles in that adorable way she does and looks back at me. “Boss lady said I should give you a shot since you have been very polite, and I agree. “

He looks my way and waves a thank you. I nod and continue cleaning the dishes. I see Paul doing some work cleaning.  Paul is a funny guy, first day I explained the Fae and he just accepted it. Not even a shred of doubt.  He also believes in aliens, so Fae wasn’t much of a stretch…

“May I go on break?” He asks me with an obvious motive. Heh.

I nod immediately and he heads out to the floor. He starts having a cup of tea while talking to Todd.  I would listen in, but the last time I did they spent the entire time debating about if Atlantis was a Fae or alien city and I was just done with that. I am ninety percent certain Todd knows which it is and is just messing with him at this point.  
Jackie sort of flirts with Mark a bit, keeping it professional, and then he leaves. She nods as he says something that makes her lean her head back a bit in surprise.  I feel suddenly protective of her. She’ll be fine. I push it down.  
“He’s picking me up at the end of my shift Friday night. Remind me to pack a makeup kit for work when we get home. I don’t want to forget.” 

I laugh.  “Going to want an overnight bag too?”

“I don’t do that first date.”

“Cindy.”

“That was a special exception as it was my first time with a woman. Also, we’ve been friends since Freshman year.  As far as I am concerned that club thing was a culmination of months of work on her part.”  She thinks for a second.  “Maybe years worth…”  
I squint my eyes at her, “You have stated you only need a yes to do so for Obie.”  
“He and like 3 others are also special cases as I have known all of them for going on years now.”  Jackie pouts at me.  She actually looks upset over this.

My hands go up as I relent immediately.  “Okay, sorry, sorry.  I did not mean to imply anything by it. He’s just very cute and has been coming here for over a month to flirt with you.”   *Not like I am slut shaming, I banged Ricardo the night I met him.  A lot…  I’d never judge her poorly, she is too amazing.*

My curiosity is killing me. “Now I gotta know, sorry.  Obie, maybe Nestra or Titania but there is that weird ancestry hang up of yours. Wait, Oberon should be included in that!”

She glares at me. “I am over most of that.”

“Cool, so who else?”  
“I am not telling you.  Also, ‘cool?’  What are you, like 50?”  
“My dad said it all the time. It stuck. And why not tell me?”  
She stares at me.  “In this place you are a power onto yourself. It is exactly like telling one of the three Queens my desire. Hell, I think I heard one of the irregulars say something about making an oath to the Queen of Coffee. No thank you, ma’am.”

My confused look must have been blatant as Connie, my favorite Dryad, that had been refilling her tea stepped in.

“She’s not wrong, my lady.  I was here when Morgana released your power to you with her blessing. We all saw it at the wedding. It has only grown with time. If court was held here in this building and now, you would be given a seat as you would be on par with any there.”  
“But I am a human!”  
“Yes and no. You are a human who has been given a Fae Pact with both the Major Courts.  In terms of raw power? You are an ArchFae on par with a Queen when you embrace it.  You easily eclipse me and any of the regulars.  Frankly, you are more powerful than most ArchFae I know of.”  
“I never signed a pact that would allow such a thing.  I know there was one sort of arranged when I bought the franchise to help the Fae, but it wasn’t for my benefit.”  
“You seal the pact and with each and every action you take.  You can’t help yourself.  Whenever a test has been given to you, you rise and meet it.  You constantly prove your devotion to the ideal of that pact. You wrote down the rules. They were made for both humans and Fae, as your staff abided by them. As such you held dominion over both.”

I get a little concerned, but she isn’t done.  I remember Em’s talk of being in a pact before.  Was it formalized and I didn’t realize it?

“You also protect your customers who do not know as well as those that do.  Every action has been a seal on the pact. You saved my life when you had nothing but a “selfish” reason to.   The courts viewed it as such well before that and began to move to make sure you could hold this place as domain. Once you could properly do so, a whisper or two was made.  And then they got you to agree to it at the congratulatory party.” She winks at me.  
I stare at Connie.  *Why is she telling me the machinations of her people?  Is this because I am her lady?*   
“The party… I remember being tipsy…. Okay, smashed, as we celebrated my buying this place. Wait… That toast?”  I am starting to realize how deep this goes when I say this.  
Connie nods and adds, “A toast is a wish. A wish is a desire and as such may be considered a request for a favor.”  
“So, the leprechaun that started it was a plant?”  I am so mad.  
She smiles, “I wouldn’t say a plant, more a volunteer.  Said he could get them the pact set if we could get you a few drinks.  He was right.”  
Jackie chimes in here, “He started it with a toast, what was it…”  
Words come tumbling into my mind, not from me.  
“A toast. May you live long and happily.”  It was Sam’s voice. The Leprechaun was a little sloshed but not bad. Then I hear my voice. “A toast, May all who come to my place find peace, calm, happiness, and may they follow the rules!!”  The memory is now clear as glass.  
Then in my mind I hear an elated Mab, Titania, Oberon, Jack, and about a dozen others speak in unison, “To peace, calm, happiness and following the rules!”

*FUCK!!*

The creature that just explained my deal with the Fae smiles at me like she is amused I hadn’t figured it out.  I look at her eyes.  They are full of mirth and the delight of someone having told a secret they have been dying to tell for ages. “Connie, if you weren’t so damn cute, I would be angry. Thank you for your kindness.”  
She lifts her cup up and points to it.  “All the thanks I need. I am yours after all, my lady.”  I roll my eyes at her. Ugh. I love that dryad, but her constant “my lady” comments and this news is disturbing me. She is smiling from ear to ear at this.

I need to know something more though.  “Connie, is there some sort of scale or hierarchy here?  You called me equal to a Queen, what does that mean tho?”

She looks at me and smiles, “In the grand scheme of things a human has little to no magical power.  The regulars are here.”  I nod and she continues.

“The enlightened are humans with some power.  Your staff are all enlightened.  Any that have seen beyond the veil have some.  Werewolves and Vampires of the lowest level are on this level.”  *Wait, my staff have powers?  Crap.  Do I need some sort of waiver?  Questionnaire?*

“No you do not.  Beyond that you have the unnamed Fae.  They are closer akin to powerful beasts or forces of nature. They are also barely below mages.”

I am keeping up so I nod.  “Human Mages are those with powerful magic.  Many Vampires fall in this level.”

*Connie needs to be wearing a hair bun, she is totally pulling off a lecture. Maybe a librarian outfit. Picturing her in the outfit works for me.*  “Pay attention, my lady, or I will put on that outfit for you and show you how good I can be. Also, I will find a good switch to use if you misbehave.”

*Shit, I was broadcasting that?*

“You were. Now then, Named Fae have greater abilities and strength.  Most of your irregulars are at this level.  Most demons fall in this area.  The nymphs and merfolk for sure.  And you know how dangerous any of US can be.”  Did she have to emphasize us and herself that much when it comes to danger?  *I mean, she is a dangerous bea… DERAIL.*

I swear she looks around for a switch…  She then clears her throat and continues.

“Human Archmages.  This level has Vampire Masters, Werewolf Alphas, most demons, and mages of such power that they can battle ArchFae.”

I nod.  “So, Merlin?”  She shakes her head.   “He was special.  Higher for him.”

“ArchFae are those that have been given or seized power.   It is a very broad and deep category.  Here you can snuff out mortals and anything short of the Human ArchMages without any worry.”

“Kings are… Well, you know a few.  They are powerful, but often in brute force sort of ways.  A King will power their way through most things; finesse isn’t their thing.  Even Jack is more about power than about caution.”

Should I take notes?  I feel like I should, I let Connie continue though. “Angels, Devils and Arch Demons are next.  They are very powerful.  They have a lot of rules.  Well, Demons in general don’t…  What little I know of them indicates they are like fallen angels, but formerly human souls.”

“Queens are next.  They have few that can compare to them.  Most are functionally immortal.  And in this domain, this place, you have the power of one.”  The sinking feeling in my stomach almost turns into an amusement park drop off ride.

“The Tuatha Dé Danaan and Fomorians are the most powerful of the races that can be killed.  The lowest of them is equal to the Queens. They fought one another until both were almost extinct.  Any of them remaining are powers not to be trifled with.  Even the Queens will defer to them.”

“And then there are the gods.  You’ve met more than I have. You have better knowledge on them than I.  That help, my lady?”

I nod.  “Yes, my friend, thank you.”  *Sorry about the lewd…*

She winks. Nd then the flirt adds, “You are welcome my lady. Most especially to the lewd.”  *Wait, what?!*

Connie walks back to her group.  Well, walking isn’t exactly the term I would use here.  I sometimes forget dryads are tree nymphs and many of the stories had them seducing men.  *That ass swaying could seduce a eunuch.*  She stops, looks at me and winks and then keeps swaying to go sit with a nymph that I have not seen before and Hannah the Selkie.

Jackie looks at me.  “Sweetie, you are paler than a ghost. Maybe you need to lay down for a second?  Paul is due off break anyway.”

She always calls me sweetie when she is concerned. *So cute*. Paul comes over as she gets me to the back room and onto the couch I have for such emergencies. 

“Do you need anything, honey?”  She looks very concerned.

I shake my head. “No.  I am mostly fine. Just shocked I got conned into a pact with them.  This explains a lot.  But um, I’m near the top?!”

“Why does it bug you so much?”

“I don’t know what was done to me. I… I am not sure I am even human anymore. Remember that incident with Morgana?  Remember how we looked in the FaeWylds at the wedding?  What if that’s the real me and this is a glamour now?  And what if this place changed you without your knowledge or consent because of me?!?! Did I hurt you?!”

*I mean, “Yes and no.” What does that mean?  I can change my body to be less plain, do I have any right to be called human?  Am I?  Did I change Jackie against her will?!  Oh gods below, I am a monster.* 

Jackie sees the pain on my face, I am sure. She flinches as I hold back tears.  I see her make up her mind and it looks like she is determined now.

“Pat.  Let me tell you who you are.”  She taps me on the chest, where my heart is and then grabs my hands and holds them.  Something about her look compels me to listen to her.

“You picked up a resume of a college student desperate to work somewhere near her residence hall.  Someone that needed the money.  Someone that had no experience in serving people like this. You had me walk in, talked to me and took a chance on me. You took me under your wing and were my friend before the end of day one.  You saved me from screwing up and giving Jack an opening. Boy woulda been in my pants in seconds or would have erased me on a whim. Instead, you began my bi awakening.”   
I laugh at that and she smiles at me.  
“I am serious. Anyway, you heard my problems then. You listened again and again.   And YOU suggested we live together to help with the bills.  You have been the best roommate possible. Flu?  Pat nurses me to health. Boyfriend or girlfriend dumped me?  Ice cream and terrible movies.  Found out you might be kicked off your lease because you housed me?  Your only concern was me. And then you still made sure I was happy when we switched places.”

I smile. We both know a Fae helped a lot there.  Also, how does she know about the kicking out part, I never told her.  SKERRIT!

She continues, “Every time I can think of where I have been down or worried since moving to NYC, you have been there. You are the most human person I know.”

I am touched by her, but she isn’t even done yet.  She looks me in the eyes.  A passion is in there I rarely see.  She needs me to understand. 

“Pat, I was dead.  YOU told death to fuck off and brought me back.  You were literally willing to throw hands with the god of death to keep me, because I am yours. I know that isn’t exactly a human thing, but your heart was human at the time and if this power let you do it, I owe it and you, my life.  I can never tell you how happy every day I get to spend is. How happy I am. And it is all thanks to you. You being you is why I love you.”  
I cry a bit too much at that. “Damn girl, trying to confess to me or something?”

She pats my leg. “Nope, not trying. Now, get yourself composed, sweetie, and then come out.”   
“What would I do without you?”

She chuckles “Pay twice as much in bills and rent, and shower with the door open.”  She winks and goes to help Paul. I start laughing.

My laugh lasts a long time.  If I ever need to center myself, I found my person.

**May 6**

Bob’s in the shop again.  He is having a hilarious conversation with Connie.  They are arguing about whether trees are sentient.  I find it hilarious, as she kinda is a sentient one.  He starts arguing that “just because they communicate and work together to protect one another doesn’t mean they are… You know what, you win this one, that’s better than humanity has managed.”

She laughs with him. He’s been talking to the irregulars more and more.  And he still has a regular chime.  He is so precious.  I can’t wait until he finds out who and what he has been talking to.

 

**May 7**

Something is in my Starbucks that shouldn’t be here. I felt him enter.  I walk out of the office and I see him.

A perfectly tailored suit in a dark red that approaches black, a black vest, bright red shirt and a black tie. Cufflinks too?  Dude is style goals.

Then he opens his mouth and ruins everything. “I don’t expect much from a place this drab, I hope my expectations are exceeded.  It would be a shame to be this well dressed and disappointed.”

I go to the counter and nod to Jackie. She immediately understands that I will be taking this order because he worries me. She smiles and winks.

“Wouldn’t want to disappoint. I mean look at that outfit. That is a sharp outfit and you should be careful because it is so sharp it could puncture the hull of an empire-class Fire Nation battle ship, leaving thousands to drown at sea!”  I smile at him.   1-0 bitch

At least 3 Fae turn and begin laughing. Whoops, did I quote Azula out loud?  
He smiles and walks forward. “A trenta iced coffee with cream, 20 pumps of raspberry, and 20 pumps of white mocha.”

I blink around 15 times in 3 seconds.

“I am sorry, we do not offer insulin shots at this location.”  2-0

He smiles and he smoothly responds, “I brought my own.” 2-1 Well played

“What may we call out to let you know your order is here?”  
“Harry”

I let Jackie know the order. She looks at him and then the order two or three times before shrugging and starting the pumps.  Professional to the end, that one.  Or so used to weird humans and Fae it isn’t even a thing anymore…

“This is a decent establishment here. Would you happen to know if Pat is around?”  
DECENT?! Mother fucker I will cut a bitch.

“I would happen to know.” I smile at him.  5 seconds later he gets that I am not going to elaborate. I did, however, answer his question.  I think I finally went beyond his line.  3-1

He actually snarls at me. He stares. It is intense. It isn’t exactly kind. In fact, it is full of malice and supernatural power. I can almost hear fear and screams of pain when our eyes meet. It is weak though.  Like he is using a watch battery to power a car.

I stare back. I can feel the changes. I can see green flames flickering about me.  He balks.

“Ah, I see. You are she.” 4-1

I am not letting him off the hook that easy.  “Why would you believe that?”

“The stare of horror I leveled at you will literally cause the soul of a mortal to panic. It renders normal people near comatose.”

“And you chose to use that within a place where the rules of hospitality are enforced?”  I am now angry. Those screams were real tortured people.  And more importantly, this bastard would have hurt one of my staff.  The more I think about what would have happened if Lemar or Jackie had been the one to fire off that line at him, and they would have, the more angry I get. My world begins a slow descent into red.

Yea, I can feel my power coming to me without prompting. I let it.   5-1 *GAME OVER BITCH!*  LET’S GO!

His eyes begin to show real fear.  His hands go up “TRUCE.  I meant only to show someone not to trifle with me…”

I really don’t have a choice. Something in me snaps. One moment I am behind the counter, the next we are eye to eye. There was no in between. “Speaking of ‘show someone not to trifle with me.’  ALRIGHT, DICK, LET’S SEE YOU LEARN THAT LESSON!!”  My voice sounds like a chorus. 

I can feel the changes. My hair is back to the elemental mess it becomes when I am the mistress of my domain. I can see my eyes, opals, and filled with green fire, reflected in his.  I may not like what I’ve become. I may even fear it, but I will use it to protect my staff, my friends, my loved ones. He is cowering, and at least 5 of the Fae within the lobby are reacting from gasps to cheering.  I snarl, not really meaning to, but the rage is boiling over.  I see his perfect little mask falter.  He damn near breaks down crying.  He looks close to wetting himself.

“Never again will you try that weak ass fucking little stunt of yours in MY domain, or you will be banned for eternity, if you are lucky enough to escape my wrath.  I don’t think you are that lucky. Do I make myself clear, GUEST?” 

“*GOD SHE IS SO FUCKING HOT RIGHT NOW!*”

I look around, trying to find the voice that said that.  Some Fae are cheering and Jackie walks up with that ridiculous drink.  “Here you are Harry.  Boss lady, can you dial it down to maybe a 4?”

I go back behind the counter the same way I came.  Between heartbeats. I turn and my anger is gone.  He jumps in surprise. I am me again.

“What would you like to speak to Pat about?”

He regains his composure quickly, I will give him that.  
“Yes… so, some of us would like to be able to come to this establishment.  We would follow your rules, of course and…”

I cut him off. “As you just did?”

He looks dejected. He nods. Takes a drink from his straw and smiles. “I would say it is heavenly, but well…. Look, I have obviously screwed up. As such I will take my leave and allow a more effective brother to communicate with you. My apologies for the offense I have made. Never again.”

He leaves and I am getting a sinking feeling. A brother.  There’s more than one.  I can think of only a few things I haven’t met that would cause the chimes to go nuts like that.  It is confirmed when Bill, a Satyr that knows EVERYONE walks up and shakes his head at me.

“Holy shit, lady. Balls of steel. I mean, not only did you win a stare down contest with a Devil, but you cowed him by invoking your power in your domain like a top end ArchFae. I have only ever seen one other Devil cowed like that and it was by Mab.  And this was not just any Devil. Harut.  Geez.”

“Who?”

Once I knew I was dealing with Fae, I sorted stopped digging in all the different occults. I have no clue who that is.

“Fallen angel, banished by God along with his brother.  Not in Sammy’s group by choice.  Met him at a mixer. Usually, a decent guy unless you disrespect him. He probably felt you had.  Well, that backfired on him. Hard.”

The bell chimes. The noise is wrong. Completely wrong, I guess this is what it sounds like for devils?  I look up.

White suit, black shirt, red tie. Dark skin, cropped hair, bright green eyes, and a smile that promises so many things.  Holy shit, I think my panties just vanished.  Yep. They are gone. No wait, they are walking out the door with my inhibitions on a date or something. I almost wave to them.  Toodles!

“Fuck, SAMMY?!??” Bill nearly yells.

The new customer laughs and does that guy arm clasping thing with Bill.  “Bill, it’s been like 60 years, hasn’t it?  Why don’t I see you around much anymore?”

“You know, Samael, busy with life. Got a family now. Wanna see pics?”  Bill purposely says it loud enough for me to hear. I owe that Satyr a drink.

My research into the occult did get me that name.  Holy shitballs.  Fuck.  It isn’t just anyone.  It’s him.  He smiles back and replies, “let me get a drink. You here with that group? I’ll be right over if they are okay with it.”  Dude is smooth.

“I’ll vouch for you.”  Bill looks happy to see him and “Sammy” seems genuinely happy to go talk with him as he turns to me. “A venti iced coffee with exactly thirteen ice cubes.” 0-1 he absolutely got me with this order.

Jackie stares at him. I control the laugh that wants to escape and instead smile. “Of course, Sammy fine to call for you to know your order is ready?”

He nods and pays in $2 bills. Cute. Normally no one has a spot in a register for $2 bills. It is a nuisance while still not being a jerk.  Well, it would be if I hadn’t gotten a register with an extra 7 drawers for such occasions. I have a spot for gold coins, silver coins, antique coins, and other weird denominations.  I put all his in with close to a dozen other $2 bills and he laughs.

“I should have figured that.”  He seems genuinely impressed.

I guess the score is 1-1 and we’re tied ladies and gentlemen. I wonder how this game goes.

“Sammy, A venti iced coffee with exactly thirteen ice cubes is ready!”  Jackie smiles her best smile at him, and he looks. He is counting. She does not disappoint.

“I see your staff follows the rules and are quite competent.”  2-1 baby!

“That’s Jackie. She is competency personified.  I will not keep you if you wish to speak with Bill.  Enjoy your time with a friend, please.”

He smiles. “Until later, then.”

Jackie walks up. Her pleasant demeanor and smile vanish in an instant.  “Who is Sammy?”  She is either worried or horny.  Both can be true at once, actually. 

“Samael, the accuser. First of the fallen.”

“Wait?!  No!”

“Other names include ‘Destroyer, Seducer, Satan, Lucifer, and The Devil.’  And he is in Starbucks ordering 13 ice cubes in his iced coffee…”  We both giggle.

15 minutes later I am face to face with the devil. I mean, he’s cute, but that’s how they get you. “What can I do to assist you, honored guest?”

He chuckles.

“First, I would like to apologize for Harry.  He’s kind of an idiot sometimes. Won’t happen again. If it does, I am sure you can deal with it.”

“Apology accepted and I can and will if need be.”  My smile promises murder.  3-1

“Second, Mikey is going to be showing up soon. This place is too good to pass up. When he does, he is going to offer you something amazing. Don’t take it.”

“You want me to take what you offer instead?”

“All I offer is to abide by your rules. Harry is getting a time out for a year. The others will all have illusions on to not scare guests. Your normal guests…”

“We call them the regulars.”

“Right. The regulars will be the safest people within this establishment while we are here. No deals allowed.  The Fae know what we are. They won’t get mad at us as long as we behave and we rarely have cause to annoy one another.” He smiles.

I figure out where this is going, “But angels are a different story, especially if Michael is involved, as angels and devils don’t mix well and an Archangel…”

“I see. Yes. You are sharp. So sharp you might sink an Empire class…”  3-2 well played.

“Knock it off. It was funny when I said it.”  I find myself winking at h*im. His smile is mesmerizing and I think I know why he has “seducer” as a name.  I could get used to talking to him like this, though*. 

I feel a wave of something dark and ugly hit me like a semi-truck.  Sammy feels it too.

“Oh my. Well, I will let you decide if you take his offer and ban my brethren or let us all enjoy your place. I assure you, none of mine will break the rules anymore. Not that you need it, but I would be here in a flash to back you up and put them down.  This place is special. I like it, and you.”  He drops a business card on the counter for me.

We both feel that wave of darkness hit again. 

“I could go for a little less competently directed murder vibes, though. Take care.”  
Competently directed murder vibes?  I turn in the direction that I felt the dark thoughts from and all I see are a few human patrons, a pixie, and Jackie talking together.  Jackie?!

Nah.

 

**May 9**

Doc Peters looks upset, “Hold up.  Satan is real and the series Lucifer isn’t far off?  Ok.  That means God is real and… oh.”

I have never seen the Doc like this. She’s obviously processing something.  I watch her flash through a dozen emotions in like 10 seconds. Then her breath catches. The waterworks start. Shit.

“Have a tissue, Doc.  I know this is technically my time, but you okay?”

She nods. “Yes.” She pulls out the silver crucifix I know she has on a chain around her neck and grabs it hard. “I… just went through a tough time and I prayed that I could find the faith in humanity to go on doing this. The next day a mermaid walked into my office and turned into a merman. They wanted help… I got my faith restored in humanity by a creature that wasn’t even human. And then more came. And now I have a human that is so much more and yet so very, very human.  He really listened… I really belong…”

We hug it out and then spend the rest of the session talking about what I intend to do about this all.  The devil on my shoulder is quiet the entire time.   I head to the shop after feeling okay about things.

 

**Later,**

Bell chimes are a Fae, they have the Imperial March in them. Huh?

Fiadh walks in and looks up. I think she is almost as upset as me. I walk passed her and touch the chime controls. By touch I mean punch.  She sees me punch the control. I don’t hide my anger as I say, “You will never hurt my friend again or I will launch you into the fucking sun!”

The chime starts again, it has “Irish Eyes” in it now. Everyone that saw that exchange claps.

Some New Yorkers probably thought that was a joke. The Fae and I know better. “Sassy son of a bitch better know its place.”

Fiadh signs to me. “Thank you.”  I nod. Jackie looks up.  She looks down again. She still isn’t able to talk to Fiadh without being upset. She isn’t ever mean or anything, but she isn’t super friendly.

Fiadh shows her mobile order.  She won’t look Jackie in the eyes. Jackie nods and hands her the drink. Not a single word or a real smile. Okay. This has got to change.

“Jackie, Fiadh, can you two come with me?”

They both nod and follow me into the office.

“You two, why won’t you look at each other or try to?  Christmas was almost awkward. But since then you have both avoided each other.  What is going on?”

Jackie sighs. “I thought about it some.  I… Why didn’t she tell you?  You could have been ready.”

I look at Jackie. “She is never wrong. She will be comforting someone that is watching a loved one dying. You think I wanted advance notice that you were dying?  You think I would want to know I am going to lose you and nothing could stop that?  You think Cindy would?  We would have tried and something worse may have happened.”

Jackie looks down at the floor.

Fiadh signs. “It could have been Connie.  There was a small chance you would let her die instead of you. If I had said something, it would have been her because you would have told Jackie and she would have hesitated.  And something worse may have happened.  I wasn’t sure until I stepped into this store and knew I would be comforting both you and Cindy. Even though I knew you would never accept it.”

Jackie looks at her. “But why not tell us that?”

“I used to have a voice.” She actually whispers this.

We both look at her.

“Every time I have told someone who they would lose, my voice becomes half as loud. It is my curse. Every time I have tried to help someone avoid their fate, I have lost my voice completely for 7 years and 7 days. I have been without my voice for over a hundred years so far. Every attempt failed. They always fail.  I always feel terrible failing. I stopped trying when this was the shattered remains of my voice.”  I can see a tear go down her cheek as she whispers this.

She looks so sad, “I need to be able to whisper something comforting to people. I can’t lose what little voice I have left or I will feel absolutely useless.  I want to comfort them and not just scream and wail so they only know horror at that moment. I want to be able to tell them it will be okay, like I did your mother, like I did Cindy.”  She looks like she is about to break.

I go to grab her hands but Jackie beats me to it.

“Please forgive my rudeness and please don’t cry. You cried enough because of me. Oh sweetie.” Fiadh hugs her.

I join the hug. It’s a hugging and crying day.

He was on his own at the time and they purposely spilled the original drinks on the furniture, I already knew which room they were staying in and told the guy. 

My wife and I gave a great relationship with the owner of the hotel as well as the staff so I helped clean up the furniture and got the receptionist to call the owner from his office, he viewed the CCTV and saw everything. I got back to my wife with our drinks (left a large tip for the barista) she went around to see the barista and make sure he was ok. The owner fair play had that families room packed up and waiting for them upon their return, he had also called all the other local hotels to warn them about the behavior and not to give them a room.

# The Concept

Realm of Dungeons is a comprehensive idle RPG that captures the essence of classic Retro browser RPG's while embracing modern mobile convenience. Drawing inspiration from legendary titles like Shakes & Fidget and Gladiatus, this dark fantasy adventure focuses on strategic character development and meaningful progression.

At its core, the game revolves around quest-based exploration where your choices matter. You'll select from three available quests, each offering unique rewards and challenges that consume stamina - a resource that refreshes every 4 hours after your first quest completion. This creates natural play sessions that respect your time while maintaining engagement.

The gameplay experience centers on several interconnected systems:

**Character Progression:** Your hero's power stems from two primary sources - statistical training and equipment quality. You can purchase stat improvements or acquire better gear through merchants and monster drops. Each level brings new possibilities, with major features like dungeons unlocking at level 5.

**Equipment Mastery:** Gear comes in six distinct quality tiers, each with unique visual indicators: Common (White), Uncommon (Green), Rare (Blue), Epic (Purple), Mythic (Orange), and Legendary (Red). The Blacksmith allows you to enhance equipment through upgrades and powerful enchantments.

**Combat & Exploration:** Battle damage affects your health, requiring strategic resource management through food consumption, campfire use, or the daily midnight health restoration. Defeating monsters fills your bestiary, providing permanent bonuses like increased experience, gold, honor, and improved loot discovery rates.

**Social Competition:** The Arena system lets you compete against other players for honor rankings, with the top position providing passive gold income - adding a competitive layer to character development.

# Core Systems

Below are the planned features for Realm of Dungeons' complete release. The initial Closed Beta includes essential mechanics listed below:

**Core Progression Systems:**

# Development Philosophy

As a solo indie creator, my commitment centers on building an experience that values both your time investment and financial trust. These are the principles guiding development:

**Ethical Monetization:** Zero pay-to-win elements or exploitative mechanics. While optional cosmetic items and quality-of-life features may be available, genuine skill and time investment will always determine success - never your spending power.

**Player-Centric Development:** Community input directly influences the game's evolution. I pledge consistent communication, open development processes, and prioritizing features that players genuinely desire.

**Excellence Over Speed:** I prefer delivering fewer, highly-polished systems rather than rushing half-finished content. Each feature should provide genuine value and entertainment.

**Sustained Commitment:** This project represents a long-term vision, not a quick revenue grab. Realm of Dungeons is designed for years of ongoing support and expansion.

**Open Communication:** Expect regular development insights, honest discussions about obstacles and victories, and transparent dialogue about the game's future direction.

# Current Status

The Closed Beta is launching in July 2025 and is currently restricted to supporters and selected testers. This approach allows me to:

* Develop the game with focused feedback from engaged players
* Scale server infrastructure sustainably
* Implement core features without the pressure of a massive player base
* Create a stable foundation before opening to everyone

**Getting Access:**

* **Instant Access:** Support the project on Patreon or Buy Me a Coffee
* **Application:** Fill out our form on Discord to join the waitlist
* **Platforms:** Currently available on iOS and Android

The game is still missing many planned features, but the core progression loop is solid. I'll try my best to bring new content, balance improvements, and bug fixes based on player feedback.

# Currently working on...

**Progression Tuning:** Finding the sweet spot between players who prefer faster advancement and those who enjoy a more gradual climb. I'm introducing adaptive progression systems and enhanced customization options.

**Community Interaction:** The demand for richer social gameplay is clear. Guild mechanics are being expanded significantly, and I'm researching additional ways for players to connect and collaborate.

**Activity Diversity:** While the core gameplay loop proves engaging, players crave more varied experiences. New dungeon formats, seasonal events, and unique challenge modes are in active development.

# Moving Forward

This first post marks just the start of our development journey! Expect bi-weekly updates featuring detailed feature breakdowns, development insights, and community spotlights.

**Planned Deep Dives:**

* Combat system mechanics and strategic elements
* Village construction and management systems
* Guild functionality and social tools
* Mobile interface design and user experience optimization

**Development Roadmap:**

* Comprehensive guild warfare system
* Additional dungeon varieties and boss encounters
* Competitive PvP seasons and tournaments
* Cross-platform web client development

# Begin Your Adventure

Realm of Dungeons transcends being just another mobile game - it's a revival of the RPG magic that originally captivated us as gamers. Free from manipulative monetization and artificial barriers, it delivers pure progression satisfaction with contemporary convenience.

Whether you're a seasoned veteran of classic browser RPGs or discovering the genre for the first time, our expanding community welcomes you. Join the Closed Beta experience, contribute your perspective, and help forge the destiny of Realm of Dungeons!

We have two children, one age of 3 and half and other age 2. 

Everything was going fine until my wifes new job that she got. She works as barber in one of better shops in our city. I work as engine tech and, here and there, I have to travel too, for 1 or 2 weeks (not that bad imo). 

I understand each works comes with its own problems and stress, it can be because of how hard work is or coworker toxic enviroment. And because of that I supported her as much as I could - I would take care of house, kids along my work etc. 

But after a year of her working, I feel she dont respect my work or my time. Her work is priority in everything, even before kids, making me leave work if kids need attention (flu/cold or some other things). She also spends almost all her time with co-workers - staying longer to hang out with them and other. She would come home, ""spend"" time with kids by browsing (tiktok/reels or something like that) phone next to them for 2 hours then put kids to sleep - she would also go to sleep at same time. (she is gifted to fell asleep at anytime she wants)

Our relationship suffers a lot because she developed ""snob"" like behavior. She thinks her job is harder than mine and that its more important - I disagree with that a lot. She would also attend ""work"" related activites that are not really work related. Example, going out with them often etc while I can not plan hangout with my friends at all. She would say ""only for hour or 2"" but would often stay longer. Sometimes she would lie about how long she works too - end early but stay to drink coffee with them. Her priority is how she would dress/look and her money mostly is going on clothing recently. One of the most hurting things happen on her birthday - kids and me where waiting for her while she choose to spend from morning 6 to 11 in evening (she worked normally and then stayed up to that time) with her coworker, paid for caterer service for them while her own kids did not even got a piece of cake. - when I said what I felt was wrong next day, she said: ""Its my birthday, and I will spend it the way I want to"". Idk, seems selfish for me...  
  
Our future plans are all on me. We planned to take a loan, to finally buy apartment we live in (we are under rent now).I managed to make a deal and gather all paperwork needed but I found out (she did not tell me at all) she already took a small loan half a year ago, making her unable to contribute to apartment/future plans until she pays it off - again I am alone in that.   
  
We did not have ""us"" time in more than a year - no date, no movie night, no hang outs etc. I feel her coworkers get 100% of attention and energy. Everything she does revolves around them. I cant even have a normal discuassion with her because she seeks advice in private matters with them rather then me. 

I did try to explain to her few times everything, but it would end up in a fight and honestly, manipulation from her side making me look like lunatic and how her work is ""most important thing ever"". And if I say we can see council meetings, she would just point out how I seek ""third"" person to point out her flaws.   
I dont want to tell my friends or my family how I feel because I also dont want to ""trash"" talk my wife with people in our life and in a way I feel embarrassed to even mention it. 

She does not cheat, but how things are going I think its a metter of time until she does because she does not have any respect for me as a partner anymore. I am honestly fed up, I feel like desperate housewive with work. I feel I should end everything.

So, let’s be real for a minute. **How many of you are already daydreaming about ditching that soul-sucking 9-to-5?** 🙋‍♂️ I mean, the thought of working for someone else while your passions sit gathering dust is just...ugh! But before you jump ship, let’s talk about how you can kickstart your journey as a beginner creator *before* this AI explosion saturates everything.

**Picture this:** You wake up whenever you please, sip your coffee while brainstorming content ideas, and create amazing stuff that actually matters to you. Sound good? It’s totally possible, and here’s how to make it happen. 🚀

### 1. **Nail Your Niche**
   - What do you love? Cooking? Gaming? Gardening? 
   - Find something that sparks joy for you; it’ll make content creation feel less like work and more like a passion project.
  
### 2. **Start Small, Stay Consistent**
   - You don’t need to drop a full-blown series right off the bat. 
   - Start with short videos, blog posts, or even social media snippets. Just keep creating regularly! 
   - It’s like building muscle; consistency is the key to growth.

### 3. **Leverage AI Tools Wisely**
   - AI can be your sidekick, not your replacement. Use tools for ideation, editing, or content management.
   - Just imagine having an AI assistant while you focus on the creative side of things. Sounds like a *dream* team, right?

### 4. **Community is Everything**
   - Join creator groups (like this amazing one!). Share your work, ask for feedback, and learn from others. 
   - Think of it as being in a digital family where everyone’s cheering you on, which makes the whole process SO much more enjoyable.

### 5. **Track Your Progress**
   - Keep an eye on your analytics. 
   - Are people engaging with your posts? What resonates more? Learning to read the room (or the data) is crucial.

### 6. **Embrace SEO (But Don’t Overthink It)**
   - A little SEO can go a long way. 
   - Think of keywords people will search for and sprinkle them naturally in your content. You’re not writing a textbook; just make it flow!

### 7. **Have Fun and Experiment**
   - Don’t be afraid to try new things! 
   - Whether it’s a quirky TikTok trend or a bold blog format, go for it. What if it flops? Who cares! At least you tried—and you may just find your new favorite thing.

### And finally... 
It’s ALL about finding that balance between hustle and heart. ✨ The journey may be rocky at times, but trust me, the rewards are *so* worth it. Plus, who else can say they’re turning passions into paychecks?

So, how about you? What’s sparking your interest in the creator space right now? 🌟 Let’s dish out our current projects and ideas—everyone’s on their own unique journey, and that’s what makes it exciting!",1,1751024295.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1llrnnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1llrnnv/new_stepdad_and_dadtobe_burning_out/,New Stepdad and Dad-to-Be Burning Out,"Hey Dads,

I recently moved into a new place with my partner who has 3 girls from a previous marriage (12, 8, and 4).  We are also expecting a boy in December.

This is my first time living with her, and I'm really struggling to adjust my lifestyle to accommodate the kiddos (we have them every other week per the custody agreement).  They're sweet, they're utterly loveable, but they are relentless -- especially with summer vacation.

We're still in the process of moving in but cannot get anything done while the girls are here as they wreck the place: plates and cups everywhere, yogurt wrappers, hair extensions, toys, paper, the whole 9 yards.  So I spend my days off trying to clean, leaving me little time to actually unpack or get the rest of my belongings from my old apartment .  In the meantime the rest of the house gets away and laundry piles up.

My partner has really bad ADHD and cannot currently take her meds, so her executive function is shot.  She has just enough energy to handle the girls, much less help keep things neat and tidy.

The girls also constantly need stimulation or have questions.  They always want to walk the dog with me, cook with me, show me things.  It's great, but as an introvert I start to lose myself in it and get burnt out.

On top of all this, I am dealing with my job changing ownership which leaves me with a million questions about my employment status and the future of my job. And I am forced to carry more weight for my team than is normal with dwindling patience for doing so.

I don't want to become the sour, passive-aggressive stepdad.  I want to be a positive force in their lives and I want to be the same for my boy when he arrives, but I'm already red-lining with these kids.

I don't have a routine.  I try to coffee/journal in our study but it's attached to the living room where the 4 year old watches Paw Patrol on full blast at 7:30 in the morning. I forget to take my meds, I miss meals, and I don't feel like I know how to take care of myself in the midst of it all.

M late 20s/F early 30s, both working in healthcare. 

Financials - 200k income per year combined after tax, living in own house with mortgage owing, and 3x investment properties combined, projecting to FIRE in 7 years if continuing to save at current rate.

Pros and cons of each 

#DINK (FIRE at 40)

*Pros* - FIRE in 7 years, reduce work hours explore the world, pursue our hobbies, start a low overheads small business that we’re both passionate about (eg coffee cart, food truck, online shop). 

*Cons* - miss out on creating a family. 

 ———————

#Kids at 35 (FIRE in early 50s best case scenario)~

*Pros* - I love kids, would love to create a family with the love of my life, and nurture a new life with her.

*Cons* - she doesn’t mind kids, but is on the fence (her own family gives her headaches, she is worried about extra responsibilities on top of her family’s). 

Reduced quality time with kids - We want to spend majority of our time with the kids, we can’t achieve this without FIRE, but after FIRE, she will be past the optimal age to have kids (will be 40 by FIRE)

After kids, FIRE will be delayed by at least 20 years (due to reduced income from reduced hours and increased expenses). 

###For those who are FIRE without kids, do you regret it? And for those with kids who are working towards FIRE, do you wish you would’ve taken the easy route?

1llrmfs,https://i.redd.it/0meqi8lthg9f1.jpeg,Story continues- I met her the other day :),"For those who don’t have the context- 

https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/s/SxIvO62BkR

So, 2 days ago, I randomly asked this girl I met to join me for brunch. To my surprise, she said yes. The conversation flowed effortlessly, and we ended up planning to meet again the next day.

Fast forward to next day: So instead of going to some fancy cafe, I suggested we go to CP- explore, cafe -hopping, etc. I know it sounds impulsive since we’d just met, but something about her energy felt familiar. I rarely connect this easily with people.

We met around 6:30 PM. The weather was windy, almost poetic. And the moment I saw her, I could tell something was off (I’ve always been good at reading faces- maybe because growing up with strict parents taught me to gauge moods before speaking). Her eyes told me she’d been crying. I wanted to ask, but I held back-I didn’t want to overstep or ruin the vibe.

Still, I tried my best to lift her mood-cracked jokes, complimented her (she looked lovely in that white shirt), took her to “cha-bar” for fish and chips, browsed books, talked about fiction, non-fiction, even self-help. But her responses were distant. She was clearly preoccupied.

Deep down, a part of me was worried-was this about a boyfriend? Was I just a random detour in someone else's story?
We kept walking. We stopped at bercos had changezi, then grabbed coffee at CCD. Nothing extravagant-I just wanted her to enjoy the city. CP in the evening is magical-affordable, spontaneous, and somehow romantic.

She’d once mentioned she liked Golgappas, so I asked if she wanted some. She refused. I’m not a fan of Golgappas myself-more of a momo guy-but I still encouraged her. She seemed emotionally withdrawn.

Finally, I couldn't hold it in. We sat on a pavement and I gently asked, “Did I do something wrong? You don’t have to share, but I’m here if you want to talk.” That’s when she broke down and told me a close friend had passed away that morning. She cried. And while part of me felt relieved that it wasn’t about me, watching her grief was heartbreaking.🥹

She blamed herself, said she wasn’t a good friend. That hit me hard- reminded me of losing someone I cared about too. 

Deep inside it resonated me with a quote that - 
“Perfection is a flaw. It’s not our perfection that defines us, but our imperfections. And it’s in those imperfections that we fall in love. I find your imperfections beautiful.”

Corny? Maybe. But I meant every word.
And something shifted-she smiled again, laughed. We talked about romantic movies- Safe Haven, The Lucky One(I’m a big fan of Zac Efron in that). She agreed.

Ps- Before parting, I bought her a small pair of earrings-nothing pricey, just ₹200-but she liked them. And that meant a lot. I could tell she felt seen. Heard.
It was a brief encounter, but meaningful. And I’m still blushing while writing this. I’ll keep you posted. 💛

However, I’m really worried about possible long-term damage from corrosion or residue inside. I don’t have AppleCare, so I’m hesitant to bring it to Apple directly due to cost. Would it be smart to open it up myself and try to clean it (I have some experience with electronics), or is that risky and better left alone since it’s still functioning?

Mark Schiefelbein\/AP](https://preview.redd.it/bkk9cc6r1g9f1.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5a8dc1679dcae73e461fddcf5d40d7cb953c398)

WASHINGTON – The US and China finalised a trade understanding reached in May in Geneva, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said, adding that the White House has imminent plans to reach agreements with a set of 10 major trading partners.

The China deal, which he said was signed two days ago, codifies the terms laid out in trade talks between Beijing and Washington, including a commitment from China to deliver rare earth minerals used in everything from wind turbines to jet planes. 

***“They’re going to deliver rare earths to us” and once that is done, “we’ll take down our countermeasures”, Mr Lutnick told Bloomberg News in an interview.***

The Chinese Commerce Ministry on June 27 said Beijing will “review and approve eligible applications for export of controlled items in accordance with the law”, and the US side will cancel restrictive measures, which it did not specify.

Asian stocks and European futures advanced, and a gauge of global equities reached another record high, in part on trade-deal optimism. 

The China agreement sets out the terms laid out in trade talks between Beijing and Washington in 2025 – a milestone after both sides accused each other of violating the terms of previous handshake accords. Yet it still hinges on future actions by both nations, [including China’s export of rare earth materials. ](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/chinese-exports-of-rare-earth-magnets-plummet-in-may)

Mr Lutnick told Bloomberg Television that Mr Donald Trump was also prepared to finalise a slate of trade deals in the coming two weeks in connection with the President’s July 9 deadline to reinstate higher tariffs he paused in April. 

“We’re going to do top 10 deals, put them in the right category, and then these other countries will fit behind,” he noted.

Mr Lutnick did not specify which nations would be part of that first wave of trade pacts, though earlier on June 26, Mr Trump suggested the US was nearing an agreement with India. 

A team of Indian trade officials, led by chief negotiator Rajesh Agarwal, is slated to hold meetings with officials in Washington over two days this week to resolve differences and find a common ground, Bloomberg News has reported.

Japan’s chief trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa also has more talks coming up in Washington. Before leaving for his seventh round of trade negotiations with US counterparts, he told reporters Japan cannot accept the US’s 25 per cent tariffs on cars.

Asked about Mr Lutnick’s remarks on 10 possible deals and the current state of US-Japan trade talks at a regular press conference on the morning of June 27 in Tokyo, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said he was aware of the report but declined to comment on it.

“Japan and the US are currently discussing the series of US tariff measures, and we will continue to make our utmost efforts on the matter as our top priority,” he said.

# Dictating terms

The President has also said that he will ultimately send “letters” to countries dictating trade terms if agreements are not reached in time. Countries will be sorted into “proper buckets” on July 9, Mr Lutnick added. Mr Trump could also extend deadlines to allow for more talks. 

“Those who have deals will have deals, and everybody else that is negotiating with us, they’ll get a response from us and then they’ll go into that package,” Mr Lutnick said. “If people want to come back and negotiate further, they’re entitled to, but that tariff rate will be set and off we’ll go.”

Mr Trump announced so-called reciprocal rates – reaching as high as 50 per cent – on April 2 but later paused the bulk of them for 90 days to allow for negotiations.

It is not yet clear how comprehensive those deals will be. Trade agreements typically take years – not mere months – to negotiate. An earlier pact with Britain still leaves major questions undecided, including a discount for some imported metals. 

The China accord Mr Lutnick described is far from a comprehensive trade deal that addresses thorny questions about fentanyl trafficking and American exporters’ access to Chinese markets. 

After an initial round of negotiations in Geneva resulted in a reduction in tariffs imposed by both countries, the US and China accused each other of violating their agreement.

After subsequent talks in London in June, negotiators announced they arrived at an understanding, pending approval from Mr Trump and President Xi Jinping.

Mr Lutnick said under the agreement inked two days ago, US “countermeasures” imposed ahead of the London talks would be lifted – but only once rare earth materials start flowing from China. Those US measures include export curbs on materials, such as ethane used to make plastic, chip software and jet engines.

The agreement comes as the US moves to ease restrictions on exports of ethane, with the Commerce Department earlier this week telling energy companies they could load that petroleum gas on to tankers and ship it to China – but not unload it there without authorisation. 

Bloomberg previously reported that American firms reliant on those Chinese minerals are still waiting on Beijing’s approval for shipments. BLOOMBERG

***Critical and strategic minerals have become increasingly important in U.S. government civilian and military policymaking in recent years. This is demonstrated by the heavy use of such minerals in many critical civilian and military infrastructures. This work will discuss how this subject has been addressed in laws, presidential documents, and works by government agencies along with congressional oversight committees and support agencies. It will stress how the United States is heavily dependent on strategic minerals from adversarial foreign countries such as China and will examine U.S. efforts to increase its ability to produce such materials in the United States by reforming permitting processes. It will conclude with recommendations for the United States to enhance its ability to produce these materials domestically and acquire them from reliable foreign sources. The conclusion will also suggest ways that the president and federal agency stakeholders can enhance public awareness of this problem and their efforts to rectify it.***

Rare earth magnets play a massive role in the auto industry, and they're found in everything from electric motors to power steering systems. But there is a [downside to the dependence on rare earth elements,](https://www.slashgear.com/1360791/downside-dependence-rare-earth-elements-electric-cars/) and most carmakers don't control where they come from. That's where China enters the picture.

Rare earth magnets are the strongest magnets and are made from elements in the Lanthanide group on the periodic table. Despite the name, these metals aren't actually rare and are fairly common in the Earth's crust. However, they're usually scattered in small amounts and mixed with other materials, which makes them difficult and costly to extract. This tight availability means only a handful of locations around the world produce most of the global supply, with China responsible for 90% of the magnets used in the auto industry.

Car companies rely heavily on rare earth magnets like neodymium and samarium-cobalt for their electric and hybrid vehicles, [including the most reliable EVs on the market,](https://www.slashgear.com/1889034/most-reliable-electric-vehicles-2025/) as they play an important role in how electric motors operate. These magnets help convert electrical power into motion, making the vehicle move. Motors built with permanent magnets are known for their efficiency, often requiring less energy and allowing the car to travel farther on a single charge. Their strength also enables a more compact motor design, reducing overall weight without sacrificing performance. On top of that, these magnets hold up well under high temperatures, providing steady, reliable function even in tough driving conditions.

# China's Rare Earth Magnet Policy Is Negatively Impacting Car Companies

In the lead-up to 2025, China started tightening its hold on rare earth exports, magnets included, by rolling out new rules and hinting at bigger changes to come. At first, the focus was mostly on raw materials and compounds, but even that was enough to make car companies nervous. The early restrictions created a lot of uncertainty for manufacturers who rely on Chinese suppliers, and it was clear something larger was on the horizon.

https://preview.redd.it/z1oshq4p2g9f1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fd594f2b907355405473c74c9c4c8fed03419c7

That shift came in April 2025, when China officially expanded its export controls to cover rare earth magnets and a group of seven heavy rare earth elements. This was a direct hit to finished products, and from that point on, companies needed special government licenses to get shipments out of the country. It marked a serious escalation in China's grip on critical materials and added even more strain to global supply chains already struggling to keep up with demand.

***As automakers work to keep production on track, finding alternatives to*** [***rare earth magnets used to power electric car motors***](https://www.slashgear.com/1660281/do-electric-cars-have-engines-how-ev-motor-drivetrain-works/) ***hasn't been easy. Engineers have tested other motor designs, but none are perfect. Induction motors, like the kind used in some Tesla models, don't depend on rare earths, but they're typically bulkier and less efficient in certain situations. Another option, switched reluctance motors, comes with its own headaches, including noisy operation and tricky control systems that would need a full redesign to be practical.***

# JUNE 27th, 2025~Nth Cycle is bringing critical metals refining to the U.S.

***Co-founded by Professor Desirée Plata, the company is already producing nickel and cobalt from battery scrap in Ohio.***

[Nth Cycle is bringing critical metals refining to the U.S. | MIT News | Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://news.mit.edu/2025/nth-cycle-brings-critical-metals-refining-0627)

[Instead of building a refinery, Nth Cycle’s team has built a modular refining system — dubbed “The Oyster” — which uses electricity, chemical precipitation, and filtration to create the same metal refining chemicals as traditional methods.Credits:Credit: Courtesy of Nth Cycle](https://preview.redd.it/xb8zmj2o3g9f1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=1de8018501ae89f958cf8326d26d24e4aad6602f)

Much like Middle Eastern oil production in the 1970s, China today dominates the global refinement of critical metals that serve as the foundation of the United States economy. In the 1970s, America’s oil dependence led to shortages that slowed growth and brought huge spikes in prices. But in recent decades, U.S. fracking technology created a new way to extract oil, transforming the nation from one of the world’s largest oil importers to one of the largest exporters.

Today the U.S. needs another technological breakthrough to secure domestic supplies of metals like lithium, cobalt, copper, and rare earth elements, which are needed for everything from batteries to jet engines and electric motors. Nth Cycle thinks it has a solution.

The company was co-founded by MIT Associate Professor Desirée Plata, CEO Megan O’Connor, and Chief Scientist Chad Vecitis to recover critical metals from industrial waste and ores using a patented, highly efficient technology known as electro-extraction.

“America is an incredibly resource-rich nation — it’s just a matter of extracting and converting those resources for use. That’s the role of refining,” says O’Connor, who worked on electro-extraction as a PhD student with Plata, back when both were at Duke University. “By filling that gap in the supply chain, we can make the United States the largest producer of critical metals in the world.”

Since last year, Nth Cycle has been producing cobalt and nickel using its first commercial system in Fairfield, Ohio. The company’s modular refining systems, which are powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels, can be deployed in a fraction of the time of traditional metal refining plants. Now, Nth Cycle aims to deploy its modular systems around the U.S. and Europe to establish new supply chains for the materials that power our economy.

“About 85 percent of the world’s critical minerals are refined in China, so it’s an economic and national security issue for us,” O’Connor says. “Even if we mine the materials here — we do have one operational nickel mine in Michigan — we then ship it overseas to be refined. Those materials are required components of multiple industries. Everything from our phones to our cars to our defense systems depend on them. I like to say critical minerals are the new oil.”

[The first Nth Cycle Oyster system is located in a 20K square foot facility in Fairfield, Ohio. It is producing the first domestic supply of premium Nickel Cobalt MHP.](https://preview.redd.it/azvgq8kv3g9f1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fd2d546e541047c58991ed050ce5b59ba17639e)

**From waste, an opportunity**

In 2014, O’Connor and Plata attended a talk by Vecitis, then a professor at Harvard University, in which he discussed his work using electrochemical filters to destroy contaminants in pharmaceutical wastewater. As part of the research, he noticed the material was reacting with metal to create crystalline copper in the filters. Following the talk, Plata asked Vecitis if he’d ever thought about using the approach for metal separation. He hadn’t but was excited to try.

At the time, Plata and O’Connor were studying mineral-dense wastewater created as a byproduct of hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas.

“The original thought was: Could we use this technology to extract those metals?” O’Connor recalls.

The focus shifted to using the technology to recover metals from electronics waste, including sources like old phones, electric vehicles, and smartwatches.

Today, manufacturers and electronic waste facilities grind up end-of-life materials and send it to huge chemical refineries overseas, which heat up the metal into a molten liquid and put it through a series of acids and bases to distill the waste back into a pure form of the desired metal.

“Each of those acids and bases have to be transported as hazardous goods, and the process for making them has a large greenhouse gas and energy footprint,” Plata explains. “That makes the economics difficult to square in anything but huge, centralized facilities — and even then it’s a challenge.”

The United States and Europe have an abundance of end-of-life scrap material, but it’s dispersed, and environmental regulations have left the West few scalable refining options.

Instead of building a refinery, Nth Cycle’s team has built a modular refining system — dubbed “The Oyster” — which can reduce costs, waste, and time-to-market by being co-located onsite with recyclers, miners, and manufacturers. The Oyster uses electricity, chemical precipitation, and filtration to create the same metal refining chemicals as traditional methods. Today, the system can process more than 3,000 metric tons of scrap per year and be customized to produce different metals.

“Electro-extraction is one of the cleanest ways to recover metal,” Plata says.

Nth Cycle received early support from the U.S. Department of Energy, and when Plata came to MIT in 2018, Nth Cycle became part of the MIT Industrial Liaison Program’s STEX25 startup accelerator.

“What’s so important about being at a place like MIT is the entrepreneurial ecosystem and the ‘tough tech’ ethos of Cambridge,” Plata explains. “That’s been hugely important to the success of Nth Cycle and one of the reasons we moved the company to the greater Boston area. Being able to access talent and patient capital was key.”

**Onshoring metal refining**

Plata says one of the proudest moments of her career came last year at the groundbreaking ceremony for Nth Cycle’s first mixed hydroxide (nickel and cobalt) production facility in Ohio. Many of Nth Cycle’s new employees at the facility had previously worked at auto and chemical facilities in the town but are now working for what Nth Cycle calls the first commercial nickel refining facility for scrap in the country.

“O’Connor’s vision of elevating people while elevating the economy is an inspiring standard of practice,” Plata says.

Nth Cycle will own and operate other Oyster systems in a business model O’Connor describes as refining as a service, where customers own the final product. The company is looking to partner with scrap yards and industrial scrap collection facilities as well as manufacturers that generate waste.

Nth Cycle is mostly working to recover metals from batteries today, but it has also used its process to recover cobalt and nickel from spent catalyst material in the oil and gas industry. Moving forward, Nth Cycle hopes to apply its process to the biggest waste sources of them all: mining.

“The world needs more critical minerals like cobalt, nickel, lithium, and copper,” O’Connor says. “The only two places you can get those materials are from recycling and mining, and both of those sources need to be chemically refined. That’s where Nth Cycle comes in. A lot of people have a negative perception of mining, but if you have a technology that can reduce waste and reduce emissions, that’s how you get more mining in regions like the U.S. That’s the impact we want this technology to have in the Western world.”

I’ve been living in Germany for almost 2 years now, and some days before something honestly left me a bit speechless.

Two days ago, I bought an almond cream in a supermarket. When I opened it at home, I noticed that the protective foil under the lid was broken – and it looked like someone had stuck their fingers into it and taken some out.
It was so disgusting that I threw it away immediately.

I had seen a few similar things before – like opened lids on products or coffee packages that were already damaged, with missing capsules, people touch Brötchen with dirty hands before picking up the one they want. But this experience with the almond cream was by far the worst.

In drugstores, I’ve noticed a similar issue:
many products – especially cosmetics – are damaged, opened, or missing seals.
Sometimes you just can’t buy anything, because it clearly looks like it was used.

I honestly never experienced it in my home country before. 

So I wanted to ask:
How do Germans/locals usually react when they see things like this?
Do they report it to the staff, or just ignore it?
Do you have any tips on how to deal with this better?

I understand that this kind of thing can’t be completely prevented I guess,
but maybe you have some experience or advice on how to stay more aware and avoid it.

But I'd like some advise about a 'friend' I have. 

I've known this person for about 5 years. But i find myself recently pulling away from her due to her attitude.

I can have a pretty chaotic life, 2 jobs, 3 volunteering rolls and my own charity, land, faimly etc. So time can get precious for me. One incident happened on a day when i was doing my charity work, 5 schools in a big hall with events, talks and activities going on ALL DAY, and as it was just me at my stall I was unable to leave or to really look at my phone. Myself and the person in question had met a few days before and I said to them would let her know if I was able too have them over the night after the school event, but i had a lot going on so it was probably going to be a no. I was also getting ready for a conference I was both talking at and had a display at 2 days after the school event, this included finishing making something important for the conference, as well as still doing my ome of my jobs on the day between events. I hadn't had time to contact her that day, because of the happy chaos of the kids, but was planning to when I got home at about 4 and listen to the voice note she had left me. When I got home I nipped out with the dog quickly, thinking I'd still have time to contact her and tell her I definitely couldn't have her over in the evening, on the walk i had responded to what i deemed more important emails, mainly about the conference, and had time to listen to the voice note (as i couldnt listen to it at the event) and was texting her back on my way home. When I got home, she was in my house (I live in an area where it's common not to lock our doors) 

I expressed that I didn't really have time to entertain her, but as she was there we'd have a quick coffee. Well, over an hour passed, and I again said I had things I really needed to get on with and asked her to leave. To which she said I'm just going to have another drink and I'll go. Which is exactly what she did. Now, i don't know if I'm wrong for feeling annoyed at this, if a friend had said to me they didn't know if I could pop over because they've got a lot on, and i didn't hear from them, I personally wouldn't turn up at their house, let myself in and stay when no one was in and definitely not after I'd been asked to leave.

Roll on to now. She's getting married. She's asked me to be a brides maid, so of cause i've been invited to the hen weekend, which i told her i most likely wouldnt be able to go to due to money being tight, we have a building project going on and is costing a LOT of money, tbink over 100k. I'd expressed a few times that I couldn't afford to go to the hen weekend as I can't afford to both loose money from not going to work and spend it at the same time, but that if I didn't get a booking for work that weekend I'd consider going after work on the friday.

Well, she was checking our booking system, continously to see if we have a booking come in for that day, which a few other friends have commented is a bit weird and intrusive, rather then her just trusting me and telling her when one came in. We did get a booking for the weekend, and she was still pushing, the first thing she asked me when she found out (from checking the system, i didnt have time to tell her as when the booking came in i was in the hospital with my mum who had an operation, she probably knew quicker then i did that we had one) was what the weather was going to be like, it's a weather dependent job, and she was asking over 3 weeks before the event. I said I have no idea as its the weather and it can change the night before. So I reconfirmed what I said, about not coming if I had work. There about 12 people going to the hen weekend, so it's not as if its just her and one or two other people where my presence will be missed. She did aslo have to cheek to tell me maybe I should get a proper job, before trying to retract the statment. Now, I love both my jobs and my volunteering, and no, I don't make a great deal of money. But honestly, I don't need to as my house and land are paid off, the fact that one job is weather dependent doesn't bother me either as I make stuff to sell when it gets cancelled and do quite well with that. I would also like to add, I NEVER complain about my finances, it's no one business but mine. It was only brought up with her now because she wants me to spend money i haven't budgeted for.

She also wants me to take more time off work to travel out of my area for a weekend to buy my own brides maid dress, originally when i agreed to this we could pick our own dresses (so i was looking at second hand bridesmaids dresses and had sent her a few that she liked) as long as it was a shade of green. Now I have to spend at least a few hundred and travel costs, again, disregarding my constant reminder that money is on a budget at the moment, but she keeps telling me I can wear it for other occasions. For a start I don't wear dresses, and where on earth am I going to be able wear a brides maid dress too. The whole wedding stuff is going to cost me close to, if not more then 2 grand, dress, hotel, travel and multiple times off work. I'd expected to take a few days off work for the wedding, of cause, but wasn't expecting the additional costs and time off, if id of done the hen weekend it would have been about 11 days off work in total (currently working 6 days a week). She was also trying for my partner (of 15 years) not to go to the wedding as it was an additional cost to her.

Anyway, a few other things for context about some of her behaviour im not to impressed at. 

I have my phone on do not disturb 8pm - 8 am, with only my partner and closest faimly menbers on my premissions to break it. She's asked me on several occasions if she can be added to that list. Each time I said no. It was because of her I actually turned it on as she'd call nearly every day, sometimes even after 9pm. It was getting quite intrusive.

Another thing was when she was working out of the country she decided to bring home 2 street dogs. And while they were in quarantine, this was for about 3 moths after she got back, she kept hinting that I should convert my loft in to another room. Basically, she didn't have permission from the people she was living with to have them, and thought me converting my loft was a good idea for her. The dogs are both extremely agressive reactive. Of cause I said no, as I have an indoor cat and at the time an elderly dog. What she thought I'd do with my pets in their own home, I don't know. But again. It was asked more then once. 

There are other incidents. And she's not always this self centred. But, people of reddit and OK OP. What do I do with this 'friend'

Sometimes I just like to sit with a larger cup of coffee for awhile. 

I've heard a 12oz americano just typically uses a double shot and the rest is water. However, when I make a double with about a 38g yield + about 95g water (recommended 1:2.5 or 1:3 ratio depending on the roast) it's obviously tiny(around 4oz). Definitely not the 12oz I usually get from a shop.

So are shops actually using 2 ""double"" shots for a 12oz? Or are they just using a larger espresso to water ratio? I feel like if I start to use more water than the 1:3 ratio, it starts to taste really watered down?",4,1751022996.0,espresso,4,0.84,False

Would be great to find a few Gooners here, or just chill folks who’d be up for watching matches together or chatting about football, life, Bangalore traffic nightmares, etc.

ATT and their contractors are destroying everyone’s yards and driveways on E Loudon. Most importantly, they have fully blocked parts of the sidewalk for a week now. We have neighbors who use motorized scooters to get around, and they can no longer ride on the sidewalk. It has fully prevented anyone with limited mobility from being able to use sidewalks and not the roads. They will not tell us when they will finish, and they will not clean up their messes.

After the severe storm that hit Lexington in the afternoon on June 26, 2025, a tree from Masterson Hills Park has fallen onto the back of my house.  This is part of the same tree that was reported down to the city on April 4, 2025 (Request# 1314989).  A police report has already been created but am awaiting a report number.  Upon initial review, it appears there is no damage but I am unable to remove the tree to fully determine the extent.

I went back to a different Sainsbury's later in my trip to get the other flavors. Matcha was meh but the Waffle Oat Latte was very good. Definitely a different taste than I normally go for in coffee but I was pleasantly surprised for it being a non-dairy bottled drink. 

Anyways, I do hope they expand to America at some point, I would be a regular customer. ",4,1751022451.0,WillNE,0,1.0,False

Morana hovered above Daisy and Carter, looking down on them. The two held their weapons close, wanting to attack but too cautious to make the first move. Never before had they directly faced an opponent so powerful and ruled by hate. But trading sideways glances, they ensured they had each other’s support, preparing to repel any assault. However, finally, Morana attacked. 

Morana quickly raised her hand, summoning a storm of razor-sharp icicles. They rained down with speed and range, which made dodging impossible. Still, Daisy and Carter charged forward. Daisy took refuge under her shield, but Carter slashed away the icicles with his sword.

The two jumped to Morana nearly perfectly synchronized. They prepared to strike her, but she softened the blow with an ice shield. However, she still came crashing down. Morana separated them with an ice wall, charging at Daisy as they landed. Daisy tossed her shield at her, but she dodged. As she tried to call it back, Morana trapped it in ice. 

Daisy hurriedly readied a punch, but Morana caught it, freezer-burning her hand. With Daisy in her grasp, Morana repeatedly struck her with a grin. She landed a punch, an elbow, and a knee to Daisy’s face and body repeatedly, her smile becoming wider as she became more bloody. Carter appeared behind Morana and stabbed his sword forward, going for the head. Morana saw him in the reflection on the ice wall, and she narrowly dodged. She flew far away, readying to shoot Daisy and Carter to oblivion. Still, Carter closed the distance in seconds, going for a decapitation. However, inches from the blade, Morana unleashed a wave of intense cold that made his metal sword brittle, breaking it.

Daisy, barely clinging to consciousness, watched Carter struggle. She saw Carter drop to his knees, shivering from the cold. Her mind became clear as Morana, with a sadistic grin, stabbed Carter in the stomach with an ice knife.

*""No!""* Daisy shouted.

Daisy's shield burst out of the ice, growing to a giant size. It moved toward Morana in a stream of light so fast that she couldn't defend herself. Slamming into her face, sending her flying into a wall.

As Morana rose, Daisy appeared in front of her. Morana moved to slash her with an ice sword, but Daisy caught her arm, crushing it. As she screamed, Daisy bludgeoned Morana with a storm of kicks and punches. Finally, Daisy grabbed Morana, jumping high in the air, and coming down with her in a suplex that shook the room.

As Daisy stood victorious over an unconscious Morana, an alarm rang, and feedback came from the speakers.

*""All hands, ready final safety checks for darkhold fortress. We will be fully functional in one minute.""* 

Daisy hurried to the control panel but collapsed from exhaustion. As time raced by she fought herself. Every inch she took brought excruciating pain, exasperating her injuries. As she finally stood up, she began to fall again, reaching the limits of her strength. However, Carter caught her before she hit the floor, and she shed tears seeing him, clutching the wound on his stomach but alive.

”You’re okay.” 

With seconds remaining until doomsday, the two helped each other to the control panel. Carter quickly input the code, Daisy pressed the big green button, and the power conduit hastily collapsed as multiple explosions went off.

Morana regained consciousness and looked around as the conduit collapsed. However, she quickly flew out of the room, but not without sealing the exit with ice first.

Without warning, Daisy and Carter saw a pillar of fire burst through the ceiling, and Daisy's stallion flew into the room.

*""Your horse?""* Carter shouted.

The stallion quickly flew over to them, and they jumped on, flying to safety.

Outside, Daisy and Carter flew through the air on the stallion. They saw the human soldiers escorting the slaves away from the fortress. Soon they witnessed the fortress explode, blowing away the clouds above, and revealing the beautiful blue sky for miles like an omen of glorious victory.

\*\*\*

Over the next few months, Damara and Carter led the charge against the remaining Nemesis forces. The people of Japan rejoiced as the ships left their skies. Those of the Sahara desert celebrated, seeing them expel the invaders from their land. All humanity joined the celebration, witnessing the Earth cleansed of the alien threat.

Later, in Washington, DC, people of every background gathered around a stage. Legions of eyes were on Damara as she got a medal for her heroism. Her face blushed bright red from embarrassment, and she hid behind her shield. However, she spotted Carter giving her a thumbs up, and she frowned. She still hadn’t told him her real identity and feared the consequences.

Meanwhile, on planet Nemesis, Mavor sat with his servants in his throne room. And his business partner stood by him in the shadows during an important meeting.

""Dr. Zola, is sure his scans are correct? This Damara is the vessel of the divinus?"" 

""Yes, emperor.""

Mavor signaled his servants to leave the room, and they quickly followed his orders. And he broke into a laughing fit as they went.

""Forgive my boldness, emperor, but I believe I have missed the joke.""

""The joke is that there was no telling how long it would have taken to destroy the divinus in its natural state. But now that it's flesh and blood, our goal is much closer.""

""I will circulate her picture through the empire and ensure everyone knows the kill-on-sight order is active.""

""Thank you, my old friend.""

On Earth, Daisy walked around a military base holding Everton's cushion close to her heart. She watched Carter from far away as he oversaw the training of recruits. 

Daisy hugged Everton's pillow. ""Everton, I hope you were right.""

Later, Daisy brought Carter to an oak tree far from anyone else.

""Well, we're here. So what's this about?""

*""Carter, I…can't wait anymore.""*

Daisy started kissing Carter like there was no tomorrow. She had been restraining her feelings for too long, but he pushed her away.

""I'm flattered, but I can't do this. It's not right.""

""I understand. You have a girlfriend.” Daisy took a deep breath, forcing a smile. “I hope you two are happy.""

""I had a girlfriend, but she died in a Nemesis attack.” Carter shed tears. “Her name was Daisy. I loved her more than anything.""

As Daisy heard Carter, she shed tears of joy, breaking into a laughing fit. But as Carter saw her, he shot her a glare.

*""You think this is funny?""* Carter shouted.

""No, no, I don't. Just look."" Light swiftly swallowed Daisy's body, and she emerged from it, reverting from Damara to her regular form.

Carter staggered back from Daisy as he saw her transformation. ""What type of sick game are you playing?""

""There's no game, Carter. I'm Daisy. Let me prove it.” Daisy tapped the oak tree. “On our first date, we went under an oak tree like this one. I told you about the worst day of my life, the day my Pa died. You held me tight, and we kissed for the first time.""

From the look on his face, Daisy knew he realized the truth. She was Daisy, practically revived from the dead. He hurried over, kissing her passionately, making up for their lost time apart, hugging her tight.

Daisy took out Everton's cushion and held it close to her heart. She reciprocated Carter's hug. And Daisy shed happy tears as she stood ready for the future, armed with the love of the men she held most dear.",1,1751021877.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

As night came, light from the town's square pierced through the black sky. It was an open space of over one thousand square feet, its borders denoted by the various homes and businesses of the townsfolk. Lilyville was abuzz with life as the townspeople celebrated Daisy's return by eating and dancing to the most joyful music. Circular tables covered with food were neatly arranged around the area for the people’s convenience as the local band gleefully played their drums and booming brass in a corner. Daisy was in the heart of it, happy as she sat with Belle and Aisha, consuming Mary’s apple pie.

Carter sat from afar, watching them giggle and have a friendly chat. He wanted to ask Daisy to dance, but he reasoned it would be better to give her alone time. Carter was more than willing to spare a night or two without her. He did have her almost totally to himself for over a year. And he knew all too well the hardship of having violence keep you apart from your family.

So, instead, he opted to indulge in the midwestern food Daisy would always long for on dinner dates. But as he took a bite of Kansas barbecue and macaroni from his plate, he noticed some little girls staring at him. He playfully winked his eye at them, and the girls blushed bright red as they ran away like the wind. However, as Mary saw this, she hurried to Daisy with a heavy breath.

""Sweetie, that boy over there.” Mary pointed at Carter. “Is he a friend of yours from the city? If so, I have a few words for him.""

""Oh, this is perfect.” Daisy stood up. “Come with me, Ma.""

Daisy took her mother’s hand, bringing her to Carter. As he saw them coming, a look of terror swept his face, and he immediately stopped eating, standing at attention like he was meeting his superior officer. But as they reached him, Daisy wrapped herself around Carter's arm, Mary's eyes widening at the sight of them as she placed her hand over her mouth.

""Ma, may I introduce you to Carter Buchanan Barnes, my boyfriend. We met after I left town. I mentioned him a bunch of times in our letters.""

Carter extended his arm to Mary for a handshake, trembling. ""It’s a pleasure to meet you, ma'am. R- Daisy said nothing but good things.""

""I see. Sweetie, may I talk to you for a little bit?""

Mary swiftly dragged Daisy back to Aisha and Belle. And as they arrived, she started nursing a migraine, rubbing her temples

Mary took a deep breath. ""Sweetie, I'm going to be honest with you. I don't know how I feel about this Carter boy.""

""Ma, he's a good man. I explained everything you need to know in our letters. Don't you trust me?""

""Of course I do. But I trust your sister, too. And she has her own opinions on the boy.""

Daisy looked at Belle with a glare.*""What type of opinions?*

As Belle saw Daisy, she let out a nervous laugh. But Mary turned Daisy's gaze back on her, and she looked her in the eye.

""She said the boy was with many different girls before you. And you stayed silent when he joked about having a new one every week.""

""Ma, I love him, and he loves me. He’s a good man, I promise.""

Daisy initiated a pinky promise, and Mary looked at her, shaking. But as she took a deep breath, she accepted. As they finished, Daisy hugged Mary, running back to Carter. They swiftly joined the rest of the townspeople, dancing the night away. And as Mary looked at them, she yielded a small smile, seeing Daisy happy.

\*\*\*

Hours later, the light and music subsided, the party was over, and the townspeople retired for the night. In the aftermath of the celebration, Aisha hugged Daisy with a desperate grasp. However, as Daisy reciprocated, she started crying.

“Aisha, is there something wrong?” Daisy asked.

*""Oh god, I hope I don't wake up tomorrow and learn this was all a dream,""* Aisha said, weeping.

""Rest assured, my friend, this is real. See you in the morning.""

""Thanks. But do you mind saying a prayer for me? I'll need it to apologize to my daddy.""

Daisy nodded to Aisha's question, and as Aisha took one more swift hug, she started to leave. But before she could, Mary hugged and kissed Aisha on the forehead goodbye.

Later, Daisy entered her old home with her family. Inside was a relatively small space of approximately four hundred square feet. Mementos covered nearly every inch of its homely styling. In one corner were the girl’s childhood pictures depicting the different stages of their lives. In another were their toys, and sewing kits, Daisy and her sisters would regularly practice their art with. And in another still, stood Joseph’s recliner beside his wife’s patted chair.

""So this is where you grew up."" Carter whistled.

""Yeah, and it looks the same as when we left. Pa's chair is even in the same spot.""

""Thank you, sweetie.” Mary turned her gaze to Carter, pointing down a hall to the right. “Now, boy, you can get settled in our guest room. It’s the first room to the left down the hall.""

""Oh, thanks, ma'am. But I prefer to bunk with Daisy.""

""What? Where did you get such an obscene idea? You are not even-""

The gears of Mary’s mind yielded an uncomfortable realization. She grew a seething glare and directed it at Daisy. And as Daisy and Belle saw her, the sisters trembled as abject terror ran down their spines.

*""Did you have sex before marriage?""* Mary shouted.

Daisy saw the fury on her mother's face and dropped to her knees as tears flowed down her eyes.

""Yes, Ma, I did. I didn't think it would be a problem because we love each other as much as you and Pa did. Belle and I-""

*""You and Belle,""* Mary interrupted.

Mary directed her glare at Belle. As she saw her, Belle followed her sister's lead. The girls quickly got on their knees before Mary.

""We're sorry. We're sorry. We're sorry,"" Belle and Daisy said in unison.

Mary nursed a migraine, pinching her forehead. ""How many times?""

As they heard their mother, the sisters raised their fingers as an answer to her question. Daisy raised four fingers and Belle two.

""You need to understand this right now. Even if god wanted you two to have these boys, your impatience disrespected him.” Mary released a deep sigh for her wayward daughters. “But pray about it tonight, and I’ll forgive you, fair?""

""Yes, ma'am, thank you,"" Daisy said.

Daisy and Belle got off their knees, but as they did, Mary hugged them both goodnight before leaving the room.

""Good night, sissy. I have a prayer to do.""

As Belle left the room, Carter hurried to Daisy.

""Red, I would like to apologize.""

""Thanks, but I knew the rules, and I broke them.” Daisy took a deep breath. “Carter-""

""Don't worry. We don't need to sleep together tonight. But do me a favor and show me your phone. I want to call my mom and sister,"" Carter interrupted.

Daisy smiled as she heard Carter and quickly grabbed his hand, guiding him toward the phone.

\*\*\*

A few days later, on a sunny morning, Carter stood outside with Belle and Aisha as he chopped wood. He put a big block of wood on a tree stump and slashed it with such speed the girls only saw the glare from the axe blade as it fell apart into neatly cut pieces. Both of them covered their mouths with their hands as they saw it.

""Pretty boy, you're almost too good with blades,"" Belle said

""Thanks, sister. I have to say it's been great coming here. I might build a place for Daisy and me after the war.""

""Speaking of which, how's that coming? With you here and all.""

""Did Daisy say anything?""

Belle nodded no to Carter's question.

""Well, to keep a long story short, I have to go somewhere called Planet Aqua in about two days. I'll meet Clive and another general to help bolster defenses.""

""In two days? And I was getting used to having a man around the house again. But anyhow, good luck, Barnes.""

""And don't worry, we'll take good care of Daisy this time. After everything, nothing else matters, not even-""

Without warning, Aisha spotted someone walking up to them, and much like Daisy with Carter, it was like the mythical love at first sight. Samuel was all her desires in a black business suit. Her heart pounded like a drum as she saw him, a handsome young man with short blond hair, blue eyes, and Caucasian.

""Good morning, Miss David. Is your mother ready to talk business?""

""Sorry, we meant to tell you earlier, but the deal is off.""

""What but-""

Samuel looked around and spotted Carter. As he saw him, he started sweating.

""C-carter Barnes, what's a war hero like you doing here? There isn't going to be trouble, is there?""

""Don't wet yourself, friend.” Carter chuckled. “I'm just enjoying some time off with my girl.""

""That's good to hear. Goodbye, Miss David.""

Samuel started to leave, but he quickly spotted Aisha. Her grace stopped him cold, and he stared at her, enamored with every detail of her body. As if Aisha was the first beautiful woman Samuel had ever seen.

""Hello, my name is Samuel. I don't think I've had the pleasure.""

""The name is Aisha Robinson.""

""I-I have to go. It was a pleasure."" 

Samuel continued leaving, but as he did, Aisha looked down, getting a good view of his butt. And with an obscene sense of pleasure, she grew a smile, admiring it.

“Cute. Chief, have you been holding out on me?”

“Please, he's just a guy from a real estate company. Ma promised to sell Pa’s old land. Besides, corporate suits aren’t my type.”

“Oh, yeah, I forgot convicts are.”

Belle seethed, huffing like a wild beast. ”Desmond and I aren't together anymore, but I won’t stand here and have you badmouth him. He paid his debt to society, so layoff.""

Daisy stepped out of the house. ""Guys, Ma and I have breakfast ready.""

As they heard, Belle and Aisha hurried to the house. Belle snarled at Aisha again like a wild beast as they left. But Aisha started laughing, seeing Belle lose her temper.

Carter dragged Daisy away from the others. ""You haven't told them yet that you're Damara, have you?""

""No, but I was planning on it tonight. How bad do you think they're going to take it?""

""I don't know. But I'm with you for the worst.""

Daisy kissed Carter. ""Thank god. Now, come on, I made your favorite strawberry pancakes with bacon.""

My wife and I have only been together for a bit over 2 years now, both 25. 

I love her more than I've ever loved anything before. She always makes me laugh and we are in sync about so many things. 

Recently we've been having problems. She has been having a ton of anxiety about my family and friends and even neighborhood, as she's a new immigrant to the country and has been here for 3 months. She finds everybody to be 'fake' around here, always acting nice but then doing actions that show they don't actually like/respect you. These thoughts are coming from her work AND my parents. Her work I believe, because every story she's told me does sound like her co workers are just some snotty brats in adult bodies. Even though it sucks for us financially, I told her it's fine if she quits as I care more about her mental health than anything else. So she did.

For extra context, we currently live in my parents house (I know, dick move on my part making my wife love with my parents for a few months. I only expected to be here for a few months to build some finances, then to rent someehere for just us.

So now my wife says she wants to be moved out of my parents house by the start of next week. She claims she's getting so much anxiety from being around them that she can't spend any more time here or she will probably ""kill herself or kill them"". I know you might read that in a joking way, but I promise you she says it in the most serious and angry way possible, then follows it with ""I'm completely serious, I can't deal with them anymore"". My parents definitely aren't perfect, as we have had some issues with them not respecting our privacy to the extent we would like, but they've never treated her in any harmful way right to get face. 

This isn't me invalidating her feelings, at least I don't want to. But even though I do find her demands to be a little brash, I told her fine that we can move out as soon as we find a place. But no, she NEEDS it to be Monday or Tuesday of next week, even if we have to stay at an AirBNB. Fine, sure. I just want her to have good mental health, and if it's my family causing the issues, it's my responsibility as her husband to protect her from that. 

But currently she's telling me she NEVER, EVER wants to come visit my parents again. She told me I could call with them if I wanted, but she doesn't even want to talk with them. I asked her if we move far away, could I come to visit them by myself. She said sure, but if we have kids at the time, I can't bring them and that it's a dick move of me to leave her with them alone. 

This is making my feel like I'm making the wrong choice. I know when you get married, you are therefore choosing your wife as your new family, making her the priority in life. But does that mean I should have to abandon my parents for probably years? 

I'm saving this part for last as it's pretty much the dealbreaker. She hits me. Yesterday when I was driving the car, she grabbed my hair, pulled me closer to her, and started hitting the top of my head really hard. WHILE I WAS DRIVING. Then when we were home, she slapped me across the face. Also, if I shit any doors between me and her trying to get some space, she came and literally kicked them open, even hitting one I locked with a chair. 

She also insults me almost daily, the most common one being calling me a pussy, usually for not ""standing up"" to my parents on her behalf. Yet I have done this multiple times, communicating with them what makes her and I uncomfortable, which they agreed to work on. But my wife's idea of standing up seems to only be to go up and start a yelling match with them. 

Yesterday was definitely the worst she's ever been, as she also took all of my clothes out of the closet and threw them on the floor. She grabbed my wallet, saying since she bought it for me she could do whatever she wanted with it, and started literally ripping 50 dollar bills in half and bending all of my credit and debit cards. She also ripped in half the picture I have of her in my wallet. And I forgot to mention that the past month or so she has dumped coffee/soda on me while I'm driving.

So yea, I'm just a bitch who can't find the balls to leave someone who is obviously abusive to me. She obviously has no respect for me, as some of these have been issues for a long time in our relationship. 

I don't want to make it seem like I don't care about her problems, as I'm sure she probably does feel that my parents somehow are against her personally, but I feel like I know them better than that, and she just won't listen to my opinion about it without just saying ""You're wrong.""

When I was 4, I had just finished being potty trained and was able to go to the bathroom by myself. I live at my nana and papa’s, with my dad and my grandma (my nana and papa needed help around the house as they were getting old, so we all communed in their house). The bathroom was past the kitchen, and in a corridor that divided into 3 doors; the far left was the bathroom, straight was my grandma’s room, and to the right was my nana and papa’s room (me and my dad slept in the basement).

At 4 1/2 - a normal day, sometime in the evening after 8PM (it was dark), I made my way to the bathroom as always, but for some reason I stopped in the corridor. It wasn’t weird for my nana and papa’s door to be open, but what caught my gaze from the other side of their bed under their window: were 2 giant eyes. Not glowing, not white, in fact I can’t even describe what they looked like because it was so bizarre. Just large black pits, the size of an adults palm, and darker than their shadowed room. I screamed. From this point forward, my dad refers to it as my “paranormal equivalent blankey-phase”.

I don’t ever remember doing this, but according to my entire family - I couldn’t go past the corridor alone, and up until I was 5 years old, I would hold my bladder until I wet myself. I asked my dad repeatedly what the monster in nana and papas room was, and if he was bad.

One night we went out for dinner at a truck stop about 30 minutes away - the whole family. I got pancakes. I brought it up again I guess. My dad asked me to explain what the monster looked like, and all I said was that it had big eyes. My memory comes back here, because what my dad drew on a napkin was exactly what I saw that night in my nana and papas basement.

My dad drew an alien on the moon next to the American flag, and in the background is earth, Saturn, the space station. I told my dad “That looks like him”.. So my dad’s new mission was to make aliens a good thing to me. He bought me an alien toy that made a bunch of alien noises when you pressed on its stomach, but that didn’t help much.

Fast forward.

My nana and papa eventually are good enough again to live alone - but my dad, grandma and myself; move into a new place across the street. I’m 7 years old.

My dad and grandma have to go to work, so my papa and nana take care of me for the day. We go for an outing and get dinner, then some groceries and return home. My papa walks with me to the door, unlocks it, and lets me in alone while he walks back to the vehicle to help my nana out and get the groceries. As soon as I see him walking down the steps back to the vehicle, I turn around and on the linoleum floor are these huge, matte grey footprints - like somebody stepped in army paint with sole less slippers on. I freeze and just stare.

My nana comes in, my papa right behind - and they notice it too. My nana looks at me, and asks “{My name}, what is this?”..

I guess she only saw one, because my papa comes in and goes “What?” - and as soon as he sees the rest of them leading to the corridor, he goes “Oh for Pete’s sake, {my nanas name}, {my name} didn’t do this. You really think she had enough time to do all of that?” And he points to how far along it goes.

My nana sighed and got me to help her take off her shoes, and my papa got on his hands and knees and started washing the marks away.

Here’s the most important part.
When my dad and grandma got off work and came to pick me up, I ran to them to tell them about the marks. My dad, being exhausted from work kind of brushed me off, and I was adamant to get him to listen - so I ran to my papa and told him to tell my dad what happened….. My papa looked at me confused as all hell, like I was speaking complete nonsense - like none of it ever happened. That was that, so I pretended it never happened too.

..2009, I am now 8 years old. My papa passed away and immediately after, my nana starts losing her memory. Repeats stories over and over again, and the news is always on. The house starts falling apart, so my dad, grandma and me - frequently go over to the house to help in whatever ways we can.

2013, I turn 12. I get a laptop.
I’m in my room, playing games on my laptop, I don’t remember what games. It’s June, there’s no windows in my room and my door is closed. Out of nowhere, a piece of plastic flies from across my room from behind my bed. I freak. I run to the living room with the piece of plastic, completely on edge and start telling my grandma that there’s no way what just happened, happened. She doesn’t believe me, and she doesn’t care. My dad asks what’s going on, I tell him, and he tells me I need to stop playing video games and watching “scary shit” on my laptop. I go to my room, grab my laptop as quick as I can, and come back to the living room to be with them and away from whatever entity I sensed was in that room.

Not long after that, my grandma said it was weird I’m always in the living room with them - and to go do something. I didn’t want to go back to my room, but I guess I eventually did.

A couple months go by, it’s now September or maybe October (I honestly can’t remember, but I know it was fall). I’m in my room, all the lights are on, my door is closed - and like I said previously.. No windows. It’s late, maybe 11PM, and I start hearing clapping in my room like somebody hitting something with their palm. I start looking around confused and panicked question what the hell is going on, and I listen. I pinpoint the sound to my ceiling, and going berserk all over my roof is a bat. I swiftly make my way out of my room, close the door and run to the living room.

I couldn’t help but laugh as I said “So. Hah. There’s a bat in my room.”

My grandma goes “Come off it, {my name}”.

I go “No, I’m serious. There’s a bat in my room.”

She goes “Yeah right there’s a bat in your room, how the hell would a bat get in your room? It would have had to go through the whole house and I haven’t seen anything!”

I smiled and made my way to the door and said “Go check for yourself then, I’ll be outside waiting for it to be out of my room.”

I walked outside, left the main door open but closed the screen door so I could see what happened, and planted myself on the sidewalk facing the door.

Lo and behold, my grandma screams for my dad and goes “No fn way! {My name} just came out here saying there was a bat in her room, and there’s a fn bat in her room!”..

I then hear my dad say a bunch of curse words and watch him make his way down the hall to my room where he says he’s going to go grab the pool net.. It takes about 10 minutes, but they get the bat out of my room. For the first time in a long time, me and my family laugh about it - and I finally feel heard for something bizarre happening. We all note; there was no way for it to get into the house, let alone my room.

TW: The most terrifying account of them all.. And I think many people have experienced something like this. I can’t be alone.

2015, I’m 14. My grandma wants my bedroom door open at all times, since I’m a teenager and always on my computer, so she has it propped open permanently with a bunch of bath robes and hangers.. It’s 4AM, I’m playing Habbo Hotel - I remember being in a McDonalds lobby pretending to order food. I felt warm out of nowhere, and so I went to take my hoodie off. I move my laptop down to my knees, and suddenly I have this urge to look up into the doorway, and there it is.

3/4 of a bald white head, but where the eyes should be - there are none. It’s horizontal, so in my brain even to this day - the only thing that makes sense is whatever this was had to be floating. The nightlight from the bathroom right outside my door, shone a rainbow green, pink, blue, white; on this things skin(?). I was in so much fear, I couldn’t speak.

I closed my laptop, and began to try and see if this thing was genuinely real, so I moved left. As I moved left, it moved right, until I could only see a sliver of its head. I felt every hair on my body raise, and I desperately begged myself to scream but I couldn’t. I went back to my previous position, and waited with my eyes cemented on the little portion of this head, as I watched it slowly go back; but it stopped halfway this time. I couldn’t move anymore after I saw that. I sat there staring at it for what felt like only a minute or 2, but time proved it was much longer (15 minutes or more, because I was kicked from the habbo lobby for idle), before watching it pull away from my doorway completely. I waited a minute after it left the doorway, before opening my laptop quickly, seeing the idle timeout and then turning my laptop off.

I sat in my bed and watched the doorway until the sun came up and my grandma started making coffee. My grandma and me shared a room, so it wasn’t her. I asked my dad if it was him, or if he had anything weird happen to him - and for the first time ever, he believed me and told me it wasn’t him. He could see how overcome with fear I was. Looking back, I don’t even know why I asked my dad if it was him, because his door was loud and covered by a plastic shower curtain - that every time he opened it, there was no way you wouldn’t know. He couldn’t even try to be inconspicuous with that door, hell I tried and tested every way to be with his door and nothing worked. Nothing made sense. I tried everything to wrap my head around it.

Even if it was my dad, the movement it made was in par with the movement I made, but it had no eyes and there was nobody else in that doorway. It ties knots in my brain when I try to come up with fathomable excuses, for what it could have been.

Maybe this is unrelated, but for months after this event, I witnessed multiple UFO’s alongside my bestfriend/neighbor (who was 3 years younger than me), when we’d be playing in our backyards. They’d come from behind the mountain, and move forward toward us, hover and leave. It always freaked my best friend out. At one point and time, we even got our parents (her mom, my dad) to come watch it with us. None of us ever questioned it, besides my best friend of course.. But as for me, my dad and her mom - it was almost serene to sit there silently and just watch as it moved so slowly and hovered.

Watching those UFO’s dulled me to the fear I use to feel about aliens, and whether what I experienced was an alien or ghost- I know what I had happen in that house was real and was unexplainable. No rhyme or reason for it either.

I ran away from home and to a new city when I turned 15 (2016), and never experienced anything like that again. My nana passed away, her house sold, and my dad and grandma packed up and moved away too.

I’ve only gone back to that town once since moving, and the whole experience felt like a dream. People looked through me, old friends like my neighbour and her mom, didn’t feel as comfortable as they use to, and the town was just grey and lifeless. Maybe that’s just the feeling you get when you return somewhere where so many weird and bizarre things happened. I don’t know. The house I use to live in got demolished, but old pictures of it still remain on Google. Whatever that thing was, wanted me to know it was after it, and came very close to revealing its full self to me. I imagine if I didn’t runaway, I would have eventually known. I’m very happy I never found out.

Everybody I’ve told this story, thinks I’ve described an Angel. Its presence was not calm. My backstory, all the way from when I was a child has something to do with it - because it stopped after I left that town. I need to know what that thing was, and I need to get it out of my head.

Once we realized the security gate was close to the Starbucks and we had a few hours until our connecting flight, we decided to take a seat at the Starbucks to finish our coffees before setting off again. After a few minutes one the employees told us the seats are not for customers who ordered “to-go” orders. We were very confused and because the employee was very rude we stood our ground and asked why we had to move if we were paying customers. The employee stormed off and had a confrontation with 3 other customers for the same reason on his way back to the front counter. A few minutes later another employee whom we believe was a “manager” told us the same thing. His English wasn’t great so it was hard to understand his explanation when we asked why we couldn’t sit there. We asked if we paid less for “to-go” cups and he just said “no it’s not about price, but it is not possible for you to sit here with to-go cups”. I’m honestly just very confused and was wondering if there is some rule, unspoken or otherwise that prohibits paying Starbucks customers from drinking their coffee inside Starbucks if their cups are “to-go”.

1llqu3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1llqu3i/bloom_stage_super_dry/,Bloom stage super dry?,"Hi there,

I'm a regular AP user and trying to dive into pourover, having some big problems however!

During the bloom stage with the V60 I'm using 30g of coffee and 60ml of water. Coffee is a lightly roasted Anaerobic Natural from Indonesia. Roast date is May 22 (give or take). It is ground with Kinggrinder K6 at 95 clicks from burr lock, which I guess is somewhere around 750-800 microns. I'm using boiling (100c) water. 

It seems like the water gets instantly absorbed by the grounds and 60ml is not even remotely close to create a slurry or wet the grounds evenly. It doesn't look like any of the V60 videos I've watched! Naturally, I would assume the solution is to use more water... but I can only imagine I would need at least double the water amount for anything decent to happen, but then that would be far too much water for the bloom stage (I read 3:1 ratio is about max for the blooming). I tried grinding finer/coarser, zero change. 

Furthermore, during the pour stages, the water refuses to stay in the dripper. When I pour, it all just goes down into the carafe almost immediately, again, nothing like any V60 videos I've watched. I admit my technique is not the best, but I do have a goose neck and I'm not doing anything too crazy with it...

I bought a Sage Barista Pro back in April, but the grinder quickly started to annoy me (inconsistent and slipper clutch would engage on many fresh beans before going fine enough). 

I have bough a DF54 from MiiCoffee on Amazon - very excited for it to arrive.

My problem.. we are running out of kitchen counter space and fitting a DF54 next to the Barista Pro will be a slight problem, but not impossible. 

The question is.. would it make sense to trade the Sage Barista Pro for Sage Bambino Plus? I can sell my Pro for roughly the same as I can buy a refurbished Bambino Plus with 12 mths. warrenty. 

I know I'm giving up some things like the LCD display, larger drip tray, better quality portafilter (I can alway upgrade this though), but what I'm most worried about is the temperature control of the Pro vs. the fixed 93 degrees on the Bambino. I do want to get into lighters roasts when my DF54 arrives so maybe the 93 degrees is not optimal (I know the Sage thermojets have their generel reliability issues in terms of temp consistensy)?

I did also consider biting the bullet and going for something like a Lelit Anna 2 PID, Gaggia Classic Pro or Rancilio Silvia, but the 10-25 min heating time is not worth it for me for where I am in my espresso journey (yet!). 

Cheers.

1llqqvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Boring-Vegetable-482/comments/1llqqvw/27_health_and_nutrition_tips_that_are_really/,27 Health and Nutrition Tips That Are Really Effective,"It’s easy to get confused when it comes to health and nutrition.

Even qualified experts often seem to have different opinions.

Yet, despite all the disagreements, there are a number of wellness tips that are well researched. Here are 27 health and nutrition tips that are actually based on good science and research.

 

# 1. Don’t drink sugar calories

Sugary drinks are among the fattest drinking items you can put into your body.

This is because you don’t measure calories from liquid sugar the same way it does for solid food.

Therefore, when you drink soda, you end up eating more total calories.

Sugary drinks are strongly associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and many other health problems.

Keep in mind that certain fruit juices may be almost as bad as soda in this regard, as they sometimes contain just as much sugar. Their small amounts of antioxidants do not negate the sugar’s harmful effects.

 

# 2. Eat nuts

Despite being high in fat, nuts are incredibly nutritious and healthy.

They’re loaded with magnesium, vitamin E, fibre, and various other nutrients.

Studies demonstrate that nuts can help you lose weight and may help fight type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

Additionally, your body doesn’t absorb 10–15% of the calories in nuts. Some evidence also suggests that this food can boost metabolism.

In one study, almonds were shown to increase weight loss by 62%, compared with complex carbs.

 

# 3. Avoid processed junk food (eat real food instead)

Processed junk food is incredibly unhealthy.

These foods have been cooked to trigger your pleasure centres, so they trick your brain into overeating — even promoting food addiction in some people.

They’re usually low in fibre, protein, and micronutrients but high in unhealthy ingredients like added sugar and refined grains. Thus, they provide mostly empty calories.

 

# 4. Don’t fear coffee

Coffee is very healthy.

It’s high in antioxidants, and studies have revealed coffee intake to longevity and a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and numerous other illnesses.

 

# 5. Eat fatty fish

Fish is a great source of **high-quality protein** and healthy fat.

This is particularly true of fatty fish, such as salmon, which is loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and various other nutrients.

Studies show that people who eat the most fish have a lower risk of several conditions, including heart disease, dementia, and **depression**.

 

# 6. Get proper sleep

The importance of getting enough quality sleep cannot be overstated.

Poor sleep can drive insulin resistance, disrupt your appetite hormones, and reduce your physical and mental performance.

What’s more, poor sleep is one of the strongest individual risk factors for weight gain and obesity. One study linked insufficient sleep to 89% and 55% increased risk of obesity in children and adults, respectively.

 

# 7. Take care of your gut health with probiotics and fibre

The bacteria in your gut, collectively called the gut microbiota, are incredibly important for overall health.

A disruption in gut bacteria is linked to some of the world’s most serious chronic diseases, including obesity.

Good ways to improve gut health include eating probiotic foods like yoghurt and sauerkraut, taking probiotic supplements, and eating plenty of fibre. Notably, fibre functions as fuel for your gut bacteria.

 

# 8. Drink some water, especially before meals

Drinking enough water can have numerous benefits.

Surprisingly, it can boost the number of calories you burn.

Two studies note that it can increase metabolism by 24–30% over 1–1.5 hours. This can amount to 96 additional calories burned if you drink 8.4 cups (2 litres) of water per day.

The optimal time to drink it is before meals. One study showed that downing 2.1 cups (500 ml) of water 30 minutes before each meal increased weight loss by 44%.

 

# 9. Don’t overcook or burn your meat

Meat can be a nutritious and healthy part of your diet. It’s very high in protein and contains various important nutrients.

However, problems occur when meat is overcooked or burnt. This can lead to the formation of harmful compounds that raise your risk of cancer

When you cook meat, make sure not to overcook or burn it.

 

# 10. Avoid bright lights before sleep

When you’re exposed to bright lights in the evening, it may disrupt your production of the sleep hormone melatonin.

One strategy is to use a pair of amber-tinted glasses that block blue light from entering your eyes in the evening.

This allows melatonin to be produced as if it were completely dark, helping you sleep better.

 

# 11. Take vitamin D3 if you don’t get much sun exposure

Sunlight is a great source of vitamin D.

Yet, most people don’t get enough sun exposure.

In fact, about 41.6% of the U.S. population is deficient in this critical vitamin.

If you’re unable to get adequate sun exposure, [**vitamin D supplements**](https://zeelabpharmacy.com/order-medicine-online) are a good alternative.

Their benefits include improved bone health, increased strength, reduced symptoms of depression, and a lower risk of cancer. Vitamin D may also help you live longer.

 

# 12. Eat vegetables and fruits

Vegetables and fruits are loaded with prebiotic fibre, **vitamins, minerals**, and many antioxidants, some of which have potent biological effects.

Studies show that people who eat the most vegetables and fruits live longer and have a lower risk of heart disease, **type 2 diabetes**, obesity, and other illnesses.

 

# 13. Make sure to eat enough protein

Eating enough protein is vital for optimal health.

What’s more, this nutrient is particularly important for weight loss.

High protein intake can boost metabolism significantly while making you feel full enough to automatically eat fewer calories. It can also reduce cravings and your desire to snack late at night.

Sufficient protein intake has also been shown to lower blood sugar and blood pressure levels.

 

# 14. Do some cardio

Doing aerobic exercise, also called cardio, is one of the best things you can do for your mental and physical health.

It’s particularly effective at reducing belly fat, the harmful type of fat that builds up around your organs. Reduced belly fat should lead to major improvements in metabolic health. 

 

# 15. Don’t smoke or do drugs, and only drink in moderation

If you smoke or abuse drugs, tackle those problems first. Diet and exercise can wait.

If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation and consider avoiding it completely if you tend to drink too much.

 

# 16. Use extra virgin olive oil

Extra virgin olive oil is one of the healthiest vegetable oils.

It’s loaded with heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and powerful antioxidants that can fight inflammation. 

Extra virgin olive oil benefits heart health, as people who consume it have a much lower risk of dying from heart attacks and strokes.

 

# 17. Minimize your sugar intake

Added sugar is one of the worst ingredients in the modern diet, as large amounts can harm your metabolic health.

High sugar intake is linked to numerous ailments, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and many forms of cancer.

 

# 18. Don’t eat a lot of refined carbs

Not all carbs are created equal.

Refined carbs have been highly processed to remove their fibre. They’re relatively low in nutrients and can harm your health when eaten in excess.

Studies show that refined carbs are linked to overeating and numerous metabolic diseases.

 

# 19. Don’t fear saturated fat

Saturated fat has been controversial.

While it’s true that saturated fat raises cholesterol levels, it also raises HDL (good) cholesterol and shrinks your LDL (bad) particles, which is linked to a lower risk of heart disease.

New studies in hundreds of thousands of people have questioned the association between saturated fat intake and heart disease.

 

# 20. Lift heavyweights

Lifting weights is one of the best things you can do to strengthen your muscles and improve your body composition.

It also leads to massive improvements in metabolic health, including improved insulin sensitivity.

The best approach is to lift weights, but doing bodyweight exercises can be just as effective.

 

# 21. Avoid artificial trans fats

Artificial trans fats are harmful, man-made fats that are strongly linked to inflammation and heart disease. While trans fats have been largely banned in the United States and elsewhere, the U.S. ban hasn’t gone fully into effect — and some foods still contain them.

 

# 22. Use plenty of herbs and spices

Many incredibly healthy herbs and spices exist.

For example, ginger and turmeric both have potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, leading to various health benefits.

Due to their powerful benefits, you should try to include as many herbs and spices as possible in your diet.

 

# 23. Take care of your relationships

Social relationships are incredibly important not only for your mental well-being but also for your physical health.

Studies show that people who have close friends and family are healthier and live much longer than those who do not.

 

# 24. Track your food intake every now and then

The only way to know exactly how many calories you eat is to weigh your food and use a nutrition tracker.

It’s also essential to make sure that you’re getting enough protein, fibre, and micronutrients.

Studies reveal that people who track their food intake tend to be more successful at losing weight and sticking to a healthy diet.

 

# 25. If you have excess belly fat, get rid of it

Belly fat is particularly harmful.

It accumulates around your organs and is strongly linked to metabolic disease.

For this reason, your waist size may be a much stronger marker of your health than your weight.

Cutting carbs and eating more protein and fibre are all excellent ways to get rid of belly fat.

 

# 26. Don’t go on a diet

Diets are notoriously ineffective and rarely work well in the long term.

In fact, dieting is one of the strongest predictors for future weight gain.

Instead of going on a diet, try adopting a healthier lifestyle. Focus on nourishing your body instead of depriving it.

Weight loss should follow as you transition to the whole, nutritious foods.

 

# 27. Eat eggs with the yolk

Whole eggs are so nutritious that they’re often termed “**nature’s multivitamin**.”

It’s a myth that eggs are bad for you because of their cholesterol content. Studies show that they have no effect on blood cholesterol in the majority of people.

Additionally, a massive review in 263,938 people found that egg intake had no association with heart disease risk.

Instead, eggs are one of the planet’s most nutritious foods. Notably, the yolk contains almost all of the healthy compounds.

 

# The bottom line

A few simple steps can go a long way toward improving your diet and wellness.

Still, if you’re trying to live a healthier life, don’t just focus on the foods you eat. Exercise, sleep, and social relationships are also important.

I’m a 30M working in hospitality. I own a bar and a coffee shop, and I’m pretty hands-on, I work as a barista, bartender, or wherever I’m needed.

Honestly, I’ve always been pretty lucky with women. It’s never been hard for me to get dates or casual hookups, and working behind the bar makes it easy to meet people. But lately, I’ve been feeling alone and realizing I want something more stable, a real connection with someone I actually vibe with, not just another casual fling.

The problem is, I feel like I’ve lost any social skill outside of the bar environment. I can talk and joke with customers all day, but when it comes to meeting women outside of work, I don’t even know where to start, and I often freeze up. I’ve tried dating apps, and while I get matches, it’s mostly with women who seem glued to their phones or only looking for endless chatting, which isn’t really my thing.

I want to meet someone present, independent, and aligned with the kind of life I want to build. I also don’t want to get stuck in the casual hookup loop when I’m craving something real, but at the same time, I have needs and don’t want to feel lonely.

I guess I’m looking for advice from people who’ve gone through something similar:

- How do you build social skills outside your work environment if you’ve gotten too used to “performing” behind the bar?

- Where can you meet people looking for stable, meaningful connections if bars and apps aren’t working?

- How do you balance physical needs while genuinely trying to find a real connection?

Any advice or experiences would help a lot. Thanks for reading.",1,1751020869.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

Will you hold my heart and I can call you my home?,"Sorry for the cheesy line above, haven't had some good cheese on a pizza in a while. Please bear with me and take a few minutes to read through. Thank you.

I'm a simple 5'8 bengali guy navigating through life and it's difficulties one day at a time. Pretty logical, practical and straight forward guy but kind of a hopeless romantic at heart stuck in the 90's unable to fit into this dating and hookup culture of today. Bit of an introvert who doesn't talk a whole lot socially, I'm someone who would love to yap with you on anything and everything.

**More insights on me:**

\- I love binge watching movies, shows etc (though I don't get much time these days)

\- Into gymming and sports. Currently enjoy playing badminton weekly. Would love if you would join me for a workout or a game of shuttles

\- Love long drives (especially with family) with music on and yapping about things. Destination is not important, the journey is.

\- I have a playful, childish side — one of my love languages is to playfully annoy and bother you

\- Eggitarian, left meat few years back

\- Big time animal lover, hence the renouncing of meat

\- Spiritual/Religious (Hindu), really like visiting temples and soaking in the energies

\- Abhor smoking, drink very rarely and socially -> can forego if it's a requirement for you

\- I know and can do all chores around the house.. mom raised me right.. I don't ever shy away from responsibilities

\- more in store for you to explore and figure out, nothing erratic or out of ordinary though

**My bad habits-**

I'll probably approach and pet that cow on the road if I see one. dogs too.

I need a long time to properly get to my senses in the morning.. I'll be holding you captive till then

I may whine like a child if I'm sleep deprived or hungry.

I'll send you a lot of reels

**What I’m Looking For:**

Someone to call my home. Someone who I can bury my head into after a long and tiring day. Someone who believes in building a relationship brick by brick, doesn't shy away from having the harder conversations and willing to work through things. My partner in crime, my best friend, who’s calm, emotionally mature, and is my rock and anchor. Looking for warmth, laughter, and the kind of love that grows stronger with time with all the highs and lows.

Brownie points for nerdy, geeky and intellectual conversations. I love ingesting trivial pieces of information about anything, which I'll bombard you with too. Do I remember it all? Nope.. which brings me to, I'm quite forgetful, but I won't forget any important dates tho, be it your bdays, our anniversary or your parents's bdays.. If you were to ask me if I remember what you wore on our last date, I'd probably be scrambing to find an answer. I would likely remember something cute or embarassing you did 10yrs back or so tho..haha..

I’m looking to get married within 1-2 years and definitely want kids in the future. Also jfyi, I won't be asking for dowry/gifts and I'd prefer a small private marriage, not a gala.

**Partner Preferences-**

Religion: Hindu

Age: 24-28

Height: <=5'7

Spiritual/Religious

Occupation: Would prefer someone who's not stuck in the corporate 9-5 rut like me, but mostly anything is fine.

Loves animals -> I have found that people who love animals are generally more empathetic and compassionate, so it's a plus

Community: I would love to be a part of yours and I expect you to welcome bengali culture too. The more festivals we can celebrate together, the better.

I would like someone who believes in family values, wants to have a family of her own and has dreams/visions of a marriage and life after, not just a wedding. It's just me and my mom and she's one of the sweetest people you could ever meet. So, I need someone who isn't tainted by the idea that all MILs are abusive towards their DILs or all guys are mumma's boys if they live with their parents. My mom has always wanted a daughter, so you'll be treated as such. Your parents are my parents too (I'm great with parents, yes will be with yours too) and I expect you to love my mom as your own too.

**Why marry me:**

\- If your idea of fun looks something like going on a hike, going for a drive or travel occassionally or explore places, be at home and spend time with family etc. instead of clubbing, partying, socializing extensively

\- Lifetime supply of cuddles and massages

\- If you're someone who would like to stay awake late in the night with a cup of coffee talking, binge watching something or watching stupid reels together

\- If you believe in building something solid, a relationship from the ground up, nurture it like a sapling and watch it grow into a strong tree standing tall

1llql0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1llql0z/what_do_you_usually_do_on_weekends/,What do you usually do on weekends?,"
It’s 3:00 PM. I’m sipping coffee, sitting by the office window, watching the afternoon scene, buildings as far as I can see, mountain beyond, streets below—quiet, almost sleepy. The trees look so green, probably because of the rain that’s been lingering for days now has finally given way to sunlight. It’s the kind of afternoon that makes you pause, makes you think.

I find myself wondering what I should do this weekend. Work is okay, but the question feels heavier than usual. 

I have more time for myself now—time that used to be shared. Time that used to be ours. 

This time last year, I was still yours. You were still mine. Funny how time flies…

Someone said it’s easier to forgive someone if you’re mad at them, when the madness fades you can forgive. But I’m not angry. I wish I were. I wish I could be. 

Instead, I’m left with a question and a longing to forget—not just you, but the version of myself that existed with you. 

I want to forget the past five years,the memory of us, not ‘cause they were all bad. But because it reminds me how I much I loved you.

I knew, even before we began, how love could both build and break me. And still, I chose to be with you. I chose to believe in us.

Now, I’m left with the feeling that maybe what I loved most was the idea of love itself. The idea of having someone to share life with—through the ups and downs, through the calmness and the storms. Someone to laugh with, cry with, grow with. Someone to make the ordinary feel extraordinary. 

Lately, I’ve been asking myself: Will I ever be ready to love again? How much of me will I be willing to lose? Will I let myself fall? Will i ever truly open up? How can I avoid the risk of being broken again?
Can I trust someone with the parts of me I’m still learning to hold gently?

I have so many questions.. and don’t have the answers yet.  But maybe that’s okay..

Maybe this life is not about finding love in someone but learning how to find love in life.. 

So there,I’m sipping coffee,looking at the view and letting the sunlight remind me that even after the cold rain, there’s still warmth.

I’m relocating to Geelong soon for work, and while I’m excited, I’m also feeling a bit overwhelmed.

I’ve been house hunting and haven’t quite found “the one” yet, but I’ve got another inspection coming up. The challenge is, I haven’t found anyone to share with either , so if you’re also looking for a place or know someone who is, hit me up!

The move is definitely happening though , the daily travel is just too much. What’s wild is that this will be the first time ever that I won’t be working weekends. I’m kind of scared but also hopeful like, I’ll finally have weekends free… but I don’t really know anyone in Geelong to enjoy them with.

Ideally, I’d love to grab coffee in the morning, go for a walk, hang out ,just enjoy those simple things with some good company. Most of my current friends can’t really come out to Geelong regularly, so I’m feeling a bit on my own.

Anyone have tips for meeting people or building a social life here? Any good local groups, events, or places to hang out where you can actually meet others (not just sit silently lol)?

Thanks in advance 💛

my dad has always been my role model and hes never came across as apart of the community, until the past year or two. one time when i was over there i was fixing coffee and saw a pride cup. i never really thought anything of it. a couple weeks later i was looking for a movie in the dvd collection and found a gay porno dvd. i honestly was grossed out so i buried that memory until ig now. he has womens clothes in his dresser and a bunch of finger nail polish and more makeup. he broke up with his ex girlfriend like 5 years ago and i thought he was for some reason keeping her clothes? i wasnt thinking. i knew all of these could be connected but just couldn't believe. one day when he was smoking a cigarette he dropped his lighter and when he got it he was wearing panties. today i was on Facebook and saw that he follows and is in multiple groups for trans people, trans women to be exact. 

is all of this ""flags"" of him being trans?

1llqfdi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1llqfdi,"Since Balance Posts are so Common Now Apparently, I Decided to Throw my Hat in the Ring Balancing the Plant Environments","Explanation for my thought process with each of these changes...

**Venus Flytraplanet:** One of the worst cards in the game, only gaining infamy thanks to the famous(ly bad) Heartichoke Combo. This card is slower than molasses, not only requiring a hefty 4-sun investment for an environment that doesn't do anything immediately, but also requiring a strong plant to do much on top of that.

I decided to halve its price but make it so it only activates once per turn. This stops it from becoming comically overpowered with Heartichoke while still making it a solid card for healing. This way, you don't just spend sun to effectively throw the game and actually get, y'know, healed.

\-

**Mushroom Grotto:** This card has been abysmal ever since it got nerfed down from 2-cost to 3-cost; Not only does it only make at most 2 puff-shrooms if per turn (often only 1), but the randomness of the puffshroom spawn lane can often suck. I didn't want to just make it 2-cost I already reduced the costs of many other environments and I think there should be at least *some* 3-cost plant environments, so I instead made it spawn puff-shrooms next-doors. 

Not only does this effectively double the value, but it also removes the annoying RNG element of praying that the puff-shroom lands where you want it to. It does make chaining Mushroom Grottos a LOT easier, but I think that's a really cool aspect of it all things considered.

\-

**Planet of the Grapes:** Hey look, another environment that's carried by its singular combo! I basically did the same thing with Flytraplanet but instead to prevent Cyclecap from becoming overpowered. Now, it's possibly useful as a sort of aggressive environment that you can play to threaten tempo through card advantage, but also has potential synergy with a couple of other Kabloom cards that aren't called 'Astro-Shroom'.

\-

**Red Plant-it:** I know it's kinda lame to kill the only 5-cost environment in the entire game, but this card is just not worth the price. for the expensive priceof 5-sun, you get a win-more environment that isn't even good at being win-more.

Simply reducing its price but also the stats it gives should be enough. Yes, it's still win-more, but it should at least be good at it!

\-

**Solar Winds:** Poor Solar Winds got hit by a giant nerf from 2-sun to 3-sun all because it had some sketchy relations with Briar Rose; now it's completely garbage and is considerably worse than every other sun-producer in the game (well that's a lie, Metal Petal technically exists).

Simply reverting its nerf should be enough. No further notes needed.

\-

**Spikeweed Sector:** Yet another poor victim of getting hit in the crossfire thanks to being used with other good cards even when it clearly wasn't *that* good itself. Reverting the nerf should be enough. No further notes needed.

\-

I'll go over the environments that I didn't buff. 

Coffee Grounds is a bit weak, but I honestly don't think it's in desperate need of a buff. I saw someone suggest it give +1/+1 to plants here, but any other buffs would probably be overkill.

Bog of Enlightenment is definitely fine. It's a simple de-buff environment that has pretty solid cases with Amphibious decks.

Hot Lava is whatever. Some cool synergies, but that's just it. It already got its cost reduced to 0 so besides maybe letting it do 1 damage when it's played, I don't see how you could possibly buff it further.

Pair Pearadise and Force Field are environments I didn't touch not because I thought they were strong, but only because I feel any rework I'd give them would either kill their identity or make them a bit too strong, so they get to stay weak.
