1m3x5gq,https://i.redd.it/w60yxgia9udf1.jpeg,Coffee and a Convict Day 4: Esteban Loaiza,"In 2018, Esteban Loaiza was pulled over in San Diego for a traffic violation. The dummy should’ve been driving more carefully, because he was trafficking over 44 pounds of cocaine, worth about $500k in a “sophisticated compartment” in his car. He was unable to post $200k bail because he was broke, despite $44M in career earnings. He was sentenced to 3 years in jail, and deported to Mexico upon completion of his sentence. 

The card is 2006 Topps base card from his time in Oakland, when he was cited for DUI, causing Billy Beane to remove all alcohol from both home and away clubhouses for liability reasons. A year later Esteban was interviewed and claimed to be a changed man.

First of all, **sorry for the delay** in fixing bugs and replying to your messages. Things have been a bit hectic lately — I'm currently in the middle of my **probation period** at work, and as much as I love Keepsidian, I have to prioritize the important stuff for now 🙇‍♂️

That said, I recently received some **truly heartwarming messages**, especially the kind ratings and even offers to sponsor me — **thank you so much!** It means the world. 💙

As much as I appreciate the support and generosity, Keepsidian is still a fun little side project for me — built out of joy, shared out of love. So for now, I’m keeping it chill and not taking any donations or special requests. Hope that’s cool with you guys 😄

Now, for the fun part: **upcoming features in development** (coming soon!):

* ⏰ **10-minute Reminder on Task Creation** I meant to add this since v1… then I forgot (ironically). A small bug in real life — I forgot to bring coffee to my girlfriend — reminded me to finally build it 😅
* 🧩 **Single File Widget** I needed a way to keep my daily routine right on my homescreen. Now you’ll be able to pin any file directly via a widget.
* 👁️‍🗨️ **“Open Preview” instead of “Open in Obsidian” (Optional)** My Obsidian is quite heavy with plugins and takes a while to open. I’m working on an option to quickly preview files within the app — much smoother!

Thanks again to everyone who's using and enjoying this small app. I’ll keep you posted ❤️

When these updates are ready and released, I’ll make another post to walk you through the changes — stay tuned!

4 vanila rods, 250ml water, 500ml cognac, 200g sugar, 20g green cardamom crop and 50g fresh chopped up ginger

Now. Scoop out the vanilia from the rods, but dont throw out the rods. Cook the vanilia with the vanilia rod and sugar for 15 minutes. Once its done, let it cool and take out the empty rods. Add the ginger, the alcohol and the green cardamom crop to the cold brew. Let it sit for 4 weeks (I recomend using a glass bottle for it and keep it in a shady place) Once the 4 weeks is up filter it and then you can use it.

1m3x2j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1m3x2j9/making_an_open_source_lever_espresso_machine/,Making an Open source Lever Espresso Machine,"So, I sometimes do coffee pop ups, where it's difficult to carry an espresso machine due to technical limitations. So I was looking for some options for manual lever espresso machine, like Flair. Most of them are pretty good, but I feel there is lack of standardisation in the options available.

For a simple non-electric mechanical machine, the prices are very inflated, I guess because getting a lever espresso machine is generally passion driven purchase. I mean on one hand, we have stuff like Aeropress, which is simple, highly customisable, gives great level of control, and is so affordable. And then we have all these lever espresso machines, priced unreasonably high for a piston, lever and a group head, and almost all the options would lack customisability. If you want more features, you buy their premium models. So I am designing my own Lever espresso machine, in Fusion 360. The goal is to have the following features -

1. **Piston Mounts** \- The piston, that pushes the water out at 6-9 bar of pressure, be either customisable (or replaceable). For example, one of the mounts can, with the use of hydraulics, multiply the pressure by 2. So if you use that mount, you will have the press longer, but for the same force applied, you might have twice the output pressure. Some other mount might have a spring attached, which softens the pressure applied, giving smooth or delayed pressure output. This way, with the use of different piston mounts, people can customise the pressure output.
2. **Choice of pressure guage** \- I would personally be building a small digital module that connects to my phone and let me visualise the pressure profile (pressure applied over time during a single press), so that I can practice different styles, but someone else might want to have a simple traditional pressure guage connected to their press. The idea is to have a place/hole where pressure guage can be mounted, and the community can choose what device they want to use. Options are limitless.
3. **Should be compatible with standard 58mm portafilter** \- I know there is no standard when it comes to portafilter, and we can't account for all types of portafilters, but I don't want to have some crazy design here that limits the type of portafilter to those of very specific styles.
4. **Lever position lock** \- Not that important for customisation, but it is a feature I want to have. Having an easy way to lock and unlock the lever angle.
5. **It should be simple yet beautiful** \- I always appreciate the simplicity of a french press, pour overs or an Aeropress. Some lever espresso machines too are simple, but some like Flair lose their charm with their (I don't know how to put it otherwise) - lack of simplicity in their design. Also, I want to clarify, by this, I don't mean that I want this design to be lacking in functionality. If a complicated gear system does a really good job in giving a really really good UX, it should be a part of the design, but it should not lock people out of options/customisability where it might be important.

The thing is - I ABSOLUTELY SUCK at Fusion 360. Because I have never used it in my life. And I am an electronics engg grad, but am absolutely clueless when it comes to the jargons used in mechanical engg. So sometimes, I am stuck because I don't know how to search for the kind of solution I want to implement.

So, this is where I need the community to step in. I would love if you all, coffee nerds (and possibly design geniuses) can help me here, making the dream lever espresso machine, so that anyone can use the design, or take inspiration from it, and manufacture it locally.

There is a man who clings to my ceiling and watches me as I sleep. His limbs are smooth and grey with an ash-like quality.  His skin reminds me of the wings of a moth. He has no mouth, nose, or ears. He only has eyes, twice as big as a normal human’s. They do not blink, but they shimmer like moons reflected in rain puddles. 

I don’t know why he’s there. There must be some reason why he takes some interest in me. I wish I could understand it. 

He’s not always stationary. Occasionally, he’ll sit on the edge of my bed while I take off my makeup. Once, he even cocked his head to the side, as if taking note of the curious ritual that is my nightly death. 

I do indeed die every night when I take off my face. I am born again in the morning, though I think \*born\* is too small a word. It’s much more like a cruel reincarnation that I’m forced to go through every time the velours and silks fall off my body. My hat and nose are kept on my vanity like icons or patron saints, though I feel no comfort placing them there. It’s not where they belong. I wonder if the faceless man knows these are my thoughts. 

I don’t know. I’ve never bothered asking. He never bothers asking me anything, and it’s my room, anyhow. 

When I lie down in my cotton sheets and old down pillow, ready for burial under the cover of night, there is no one to place coins on my eyes for the ferryman. I am left to languish in a dreamless purgatory. No Hermes or Valkyrie leads me to death. No force pulls me from the Bardo. I am left to wait in the tomb with my visitor looking down on me. Perhaps his eyes are the only coins I’ll receive. Perhaps he’ll come down one day and place them upon my own. 

I’ve decided to name him Gooby.

\*\*\*

I do not like instant coffee. It’s disingenuous and tastes like burnt butter. That said, I drink it every morning. This is for several reasons, the least of which is that a singular mug appears on my end table daily, bearing the inscription “Clowning around.” The other reasons are personal and have to do with love languages, such as gift giving, and my general laziness in preparing anything else to drink.

I think Gooby prepares it for me. I don’t know.

I didn’t see him sitting on the edge of my bed that morning, so I imagine he’s off doing something. Maybe he crochets. I wonder if he’d make me a hat.

As I take my first sip of coffee and let its bitter warmth infest my veins, I stare at myself in the mirror and feel my blood run cold. This happens every morning without fail, and it never ceases to terrify me to my core. It is the kind of petrifying fear that you only get when noticing a figure at the corner of your vision. A stranger is watching me through the glass, drinking instant coffee out of a mug labeled “dnuorA gninwolC”. I don’t recognize his face. 

I have a medical condition. Probably should have mentioned that, but better late than never. Doctors say it’s something similar to Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder, but it’s not quite that. You typically feel like you’re in a dreamlike state with DPDR, and everything is supposed to move more slowly. I don’t feel like I’m in a dream at all. Everything moves the same. Everything feels so vivid and focused that I sometimes almost vomit from motion sickness. No, I feel like I’m awake, aware, and painfully receptive to the horrible things of my reality. It’s just my face.

I never recognize my face. It’s never the same to me. I can’t tell if it switches forms or if my memory is simply that bad, but I am never at ease with it. My makeup is the only thing that calms me down. 

I start my ritual the same every morning. First is the white makeup, the canvas, the blank slate from which I carve my visage. Then comes the black, void, deeper than night and shadow, festering like a ripe spawn of the depths. Then I draw a little shamrock on my cheek because I like green. Finally, I force on my red eyebrows and smile. I apply enough powder to last through a hurricane, and finally, I'm ready to go. I step out of my trailer and into the desert that I call home. 

What I stated in the title is true. I reside in a permanent Carnival fixture that rests on the side of a near-endless stretch of highway in the middle of the desert. I have no idea what state I'm in, nor if I'm even in America. What I do know is that any mail I get is completely unmarked, save for my name, and it always appears at the doorstep of my trailer every week, anchored under a rock.  I'm fairly certain the boss reads my mail, which is why my name is always misspelled on the envelope, but I don't care.  I cook for myself, clean up after myself, and live alone in a trailer that I'm almost certain used to be a drug den. I cleaned it up, got rid of all the stains in the carpet,  and now it is mine.  I do find the occasional needle or bone every once in a while, but no home is perfect, especially around here.

I'm not completely devoid of supplies, of course. There is a gas station about a mile down the road run by an elderly couple who swear I'm not the strangest thing they've seen walking into their doors at night. I am apparently the friendliest, which is worrying in its own regard. 

I use them to stock up on basic groceries and toiletries to get by, which is convenient considering that my pay is what many would consider abysmal. That said, in the instance that the boss sees this and decides to dock me for complaining,  I am joking. I don't have much I need to buy anyway, and, scary as it may be, delivery services do still work out here.

But that is my existence, and one that I am stuck with. I have a gigantic orange tricycle that I ride when I don't want to walk, and a comfy set of size 20 shoes that get me the rest of the way. All in all, it’s a steady job, but one I find taxing on the best days. 

I'll summarize it like this:  I am a clown who does not talk. I never talk. I'm half convinced I can't, but even if I wanted to try, it wouldn't be with the people around here. Most of my coworkers are fine people as they are, but sometimes the scarier things come in the form of the guests.

One of my talents is balloon animals. I can make almost anything proficiently.  Sometimes I'll get the occasional person who wants to try and challenge me, and they’ll try to order off the menu I carry around with my balloon bag. Many times, they're innocent enough.  Several children want their favorite cartoon characters, or Tommy guns, or ( insert exotic animal here), but on occasion, the requests can get a tad morbid. 

Today, I remember one corpulent little boy stopping me on my way to clean out the petting zoo to make such a request. 

“Can you make a spine?” he asked me.

I stared at him for a second before raising my question-mark sign. 

“Y’know,” he repeated, “A spine? Like what’s in your back?”

The stare continued as a couple in matching Hawaiian shirts walked up behind him. They were assumed to be his parents, but they did not attempt to dissuade him. 

“Carter,” said the woman in a distinctly shrill Minnesota accent, “Don’t be silly.”

“Carter, you know better,” said the man with an almost shriller accent, “you have to be more specific. What kind of spine?”

“Oh!” the boy said, with a wide smile. “Duh! Sorry, Mr. Clown. Can I have a human spine, please?

I kept the question-mark sign up. 

“Oh, it doesn’t have to have a skull attached!” the man laughed, “Sorry for the confusion. Just the spine itself would be nice for the boy.”

“Oh, maybe a pelvis!” the woman added. “Good eatin’ on one of those. Could you do that, Mr. Clown?”

By this point, I had retrieved my whiteboard and expo marker to try and write out a more sophisticated response, but the woman cut me off. 

“Y’know,” she said, reaching into her beach bag, “kinda like this?”

Out of the bag, she proceeded to pull out a yellow spine, at least a meter in length. It was old, though not dusty, and had several gnarled splinters coming off of its vertebrae. I was hesitant to ask where she’d gotten it, but the man spoke up next her her.

“Oh, would you look at that, hon?” he said, all sentimental, “That’s from our first road trip, innit? What was his name?” 

“Jo?”

“No, wasn’t jo? Hank?” 

“Dillion!” said the boy. “You told me about that one.” 

The boy’s father ruffled his shaggy hair as he adjusted his sunglasses. “That’s it! Wow! Look at the kid on this brain, hon! So mindful!”

“He sure is!” the woman said. “That trip was before you were even born.”

“Ah, good memories. Good memories…” The father looked back at me with a smile. “So what d’ya say, Mr. Clown? Spine sound good?”

He held out a twenty, and if I were a prouder man, I would’ve been more apprehensive at taking it. But a twenty is a twenty. I made the best spine I could, using every shade of white and bone yellow I could think of, and in less than a minute, the boy was holding his latex prize and beaming like it was Christmas. 

The parents thanked me and parted ways, and I can’t recall seeing them the rest of the day. I went about my normal route through the petting zoo, the ferris wheel, the hall of mirrors, etc., and it wasn’t until this evening that I heard of anything wrong. 

A sheriff’s deputy was at the gates by six o’clock and was speaking sternly with the head manager. The manager, Bill, an older man who always wore a striped jacket and straw boater hat, was making every disarming gesture in the book as he conversed with the man. Eventually, the deputy left, and Bill locked the gates behind him. He passed by and gave a bright, “Evening, Bubbles!” but I stopped him with my question-sign. 

“Oh, that?” He said, smiling, “It’s nothing. Just something for the boss to handle.”

 I gave the sign another shake. 

“Oh, Bubs,” he said, checking over his shoulder before leaning in. “They’re just looking for one of the teenagers from back in town. That’s all.” He straightened his bowtie. “Y’know, Bradley, who works the tickets at the Ferris wheel? His folks called the sheriff and said he was supposed to be home hours ago. Never did clock out, come to think of it… Well, I don’t know. He only tore tickets for one family today- great tippers, by the way- and, well…” He paused and held up his hands defensively. “I’m rambling. Point is, it’s nothing for you to worry about. Go get some rest! We still have a few weeks until tourist season starts up again. Savor it all while you can!”

With that, he was off, and I was left feeling for the twenty in my pocket. There was nothing to be done. At the end of the day, there was no one to tell, and I didn’t even have a name or vehicle to attach to any floating suspicions. Not to mention, it was getting late, and the gas station was at least half an hour away by trike, so I stowed my balloons, unlocked my ride from its fence post, and took off down the road. The gas station’s glow was a fly-light in the distance, and I was a moth with twenty dollars to spend. 

\*\*\*

Most children, on a long car ride, for whatever reason, imagine some kind of being that runs alongside them on the road. It’s always moving at impossible speeds, keeping time with every stop, turn, and acceleration, pacing like a silent wolf through a deep bed of snow. I never had one of those as a child, but I do have one now, more or less.

As I race my trike through the obsidian night, a single LED headlight gleaming, I sometimes see a pale figure, stark white and tall, bounding on the horizon towards the road. Sometimes, when I ride slower, I swear I can hear him howling something. He seems urgent, panicked, even, but I can’t make out his face. He’s a blip in the twilight of the desert. A single pale flame shimmering on the backdrop of a purple void. If I wait even longer, his mournful voice sounds familiar to me, but even then, I cannot recognize him. 

I’ve tried to name him, but nothing sticks. Chad didn’t work. Didn’t have the right mouthfeel. Neither did Otis or Wheeler. He’s such a simple-looking thing, and those are always the hardest to name. I’ve just started calling him “That Guy,” and that works about as well as anything. He’s always gone when I make it to the gas station, but he reappears on my rides back, still in the distance and still running. 

That Guy is odd, for sure,  but in all the years I’ve seen him, he’s never done me a bad turn. His presence, even if unsettling, reminds me that I’m not alone on my nightly ride. I blew him a kiss tonight in a dramatic fashion before entering my trailer. His howling evaporated as my door slammed shut. 

I brought Gooby back some peanut M&Ms and left them on my dresser with a note saying they were his. I didn’t really think about how he’d eat them, seeing as he has no mouth, but I figured it was the thought that counted. I performed my ritual and stared briefly at the stranger in the mirror before me, trying to take in any solid feature, but I couldn’t. I shivered and went to bury myself in the covers of my bed, but was met by something unexpected.

There, neatly folded on my pillow, was a crocheted cap with a tassel on the end. It was a handsome thing and only vaguely smelled of vinegar. I put on, and that was enough inspiration to get me to write this. Long post, I know, but hey, I have a new hat. I think it’s rather nice of Gooby to do, and I wanted to brag on him. If he does anything else brag-worthy, I’ll be sure to post again. In the meantime, wish me luck and pray to whatever you may believe in that the gas station gets a new instant ramen flavor in soon. I’m getting tired of shrimp.  Thanks for reading this far. 

Also, on a separate note, if you meet a midwestern couple in Hawaiian shirts, maybe try being somewhere else. Or make a balloon animal for them.

I guess you could say they just seemed genuinely at ease with each other, and it was kinda heartwarming in its ordinariness. 

That little moment made me pause. I realized that I'd built some quiet strength of my own lately. Despite stress and all the little chaos life throws our way, I've held things together more than I thought possible. It was like watching them reminded me how I've managed to stay resilient without really noticing it.

I think what I learned is that resilience doesn't always roar. Sometimes it's just a gentle warmth or a steady smile during a normal, mundane day. Anyways, it just felt nice to recognize that part of myself. 😊",4,1752933646.0,snapinsight,0,1.0,False

I’ve been testing this programmable drip coffee machine daily, and while it's not a flawless product, there's a lot to appreciate. The 10-cup thermal carafe caught my attention right away. It feels solid in hand and does an excellent job of keeping coffee piping hot for hours - key for someone like me who hates lukewarm coffee! It’s also been a morning companion that’s saving me time with its 24-hour programmability. Just load it up before bed, and the aroma of coffee greets me as I stumble into the kitchen at sunrise.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, this machine feels robust. The black thermal design is sleek without overplaying its hands in the style department, which means it fits into both modern and traditional kitchen setups. The carafe is thoughtfully designed with an ergonomic, knuckle-guarded handle and a drip-free spout that prevents those annoying spills as you pour. Measuring approximately 14.25 inches tall, it’s compact enough to tuck under most kitchen cabinets, yet substantial enough not to feel flimsy during operation. I'll admit, I occasionally fumbled with the carafe lid since it’s a bit stiff to remove at first. Still, its overall durability outweighs minor annoyances.  

**Performance and Programmable Features**  
This coffeemaker is a workhorse, and for someone who drinks coffee like it’s water, it hasn’t disappointed. The programmable settings are simple to operate. The buttons are intuitive, and the LCD clock is easy to read, even with groggy eyes in the early hours of the morning. I often use the Brew Pause feature, especially when I just can't wait for the entire pot to finish brewing - a lifesaver during hectic mornings. Its 60-second reset function is an unnoticed hero of the machine, ""remembering"" settings and progress even if I accidentally unplug it.

**Reusable Filters: A Nice Touch**  
One of the key positives here is the dual filtering system. The gold-tone commercial-style permanent filter and included charcoal water filter ensure each cup has a crisp, clean flavor. The ease of maintenance for these reusable filters is particularly appealing - no more running out for paper filters, which has been a game changer. I definitely noticed superior taste compared to my old single-filter coffee maker. If you’re someone who nitpicks over the flavor of their brew, this feature delivers.  

**Advantages**  
- The thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for hours without burning its flavor.  
- The 24-hour programmability is a game changer.  
- Compact size that still feels sturdy and reliable.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The lid on the carafe could use a redesign to make removal easier.  
- The buttons, while intuitive, don’t feel as premium as the rest of the machine.  
- Brewing a full 10-cup batch can be a bit time-consuming compared to other models.  

**Competing Products**  
When stacked against competitors like the Black+Decker 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, this Cuisinart model holds its ground in terms of build quality and features but falls slightly behind in price considerations. Meanwhile, the Keurig line, like the K-Elite, offers unparalleled speed due to their single-serve brewing but fails to provide the same fresh-brewed flavor for larger batches. If you’re after the combination of programmable flexibility and consistent quality, the Cuisinart pulls ahead by a mile, especially for coffee aficionados who appreciate the care put into the machine’s filtering process.  

**Value for Money**  
From my daily use, this machine offers bang for the buck, especially considering its thoughtful design and thermal carafe features. High-quality components like reusable filters only increase its cost efficiency. While it might not cater to budget buyers looking for a super-basic coffee maker, it’s a worthy investment for those who like freshly brewed coffee that stays hot for hours. The lasting durability of the carafe, combined with the machine’s reliability, stacks up well against its competitors in this class of coffee machines.

1m3wx1s,https://i.redd.it/cptvhvng7udf1.jpeg,Help,"Endodontist said my tooth was perfectly fine after I went in for sensitivity. The sensitivity has been going on for over a year and dentist told me to brush with sensodyne They eventually referred me to the Endo. Now I’ve started having pain radiating to my jaw and around my temple/ear area. I originally thought it was due to a pinched nerve in my trap area but when I drank coffee this morning I had the worst pain. The funny thing is is that the tooth itself didn’t hurt upon drinking. It started at the temporomandibular joint and radiated to the temple and ear. 

Idk if this is due to that same tooth but that’s the only thing I can suspect. I kept asking questions to be sure. She said if there were something wrong that she would see it and that I would have responded differently to the test she did. It didn’t hurt when I bit down on the cotton or stick and I felt sensitivity when she applied the cold spray. If there isn’t something wrong with that tooth aside from having a deep filling then what could it be?

In 2025, buying a coffee maker in the US still feels tricky. Specs sound impressive, but many models break down or underdeliver after just a few months. You’ll often run into:

* Inconsistent brew temperatures
* Plastic taste that never goes away
* Noisy operation or leaking carafes
* Poor durability, especially on budget models
* “Programmable” features that barely work

\---------------------------

Most YouTube reviews don’t cover long-term issues because they are sponsored. Unless a review is clearly unsponsored or based on months of daily use, be skeptical. I’ve used and tested several brewers across price ranges, and this list filters out the junk. Will keep it updated as better options prove themselves.

\---------------------------

# Best Coffee Makers by Budget (2025)

**Under $100 — For Basic Daily Use or Small Households**

**1. Black+Decker 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker**

* Easy to use, solid performance for the price
* Auto-brew timer, pause-and-serve feature
* Great for budget-conscious buyers who want no-frills coffee

**2. Hamilton Beach FlexBrew**

* Works with K-Cups *and* ground coffee
* Single-serve or full pot options
* Compact and versatile, but slower brew times

\---------------------------

**Under $300 — For Daily Drinkers Who Care About Taste**

**1. Ninja Specialty Coffee Maker (SCA Certified)**

* Makes lattes, cappuccinos, iced coffee
* Built-in milk frother, strong brew setting
* One of the best all-in-ones for the money

**2. Bonavita Connoisseur 8-Cup Brewer**

* Fast brew, precise temperature control
* SCA Certified, makes consistently great drip coffee
* Compact stainless steel design, ideal for small kitchens

\---------------------------

**Under $600 — For Serious Coffee Lovers and Long-Term Use**

**1. Technivorm Moccamaster KBT**

**2. Breville Precision Brewer**

* Adjustable flow rate, bloom time, and temp
* Great for experimenting with brew methods

\---------------------------

# What Actually Matters When Buying a Coffee Maker

**Brew Temperature:** Look for 195–205°F brewing for best flavor.

**SCA Certification:** It ensures a machine meets key performance standards.

**Carafe Type:** Thermal > Glass (no need for a hot plate, which ruins flavor).

**Programmable Features:** Useful if you brew at a fixed time daily, but only if they work well.

**Build Quality:** Stainless steel components last longer than plastic-heavy models.

**Ease of Cleaning:** A removable water tank and simple design save time.

\---------------------------

# Final Thoughts

Don’t fall for the hype. A good coffee maker isn’t just about fancy buttons, it’s about consistent, delicious coffee and long-term reliability. Stick with brands and models that are proven over time, not just trendy in ads.

1m3ws41,https://www.reddit.com/r/UARSnew/comments/1m3ws41/i_dont_understand_if_i_invented_this_or_if_its/,I don't understand if I invented this or if it's real ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,"Hi all, been reading many stories in these subs and they helped me a lot understand my sleep issue, thank you all. But what I don't get yet is if the symptoms I have can be a sign of UARS. BTW I have a perfect sleep hygiene... I applied everything neurologists like Huberman or Walker suggest.

Since I don't have a diagnosis (difficult!) yet, I'll try to list my symptoms/events that occurred to me here:

1. Problems with time: firstly, this is an issue I have since always. I tried every hack but always a a problem in doing things with a good timing. And this worsened now

2. Fainting moments: if I try to get up from a sofa or a chair after I've been sitting there for a while, sometimes I feel these fainting/sleepy moments,like i feel the urge to sit/lieve down on the floor XD, anyway this happens at home were i can feel more relaxed.

3. Chocking and moaning during sleep: recorded it and this happens sometimes, probably other times it happens too but I can't hear it

4. Myofunction therapy worked for 1 month: actually balloons blowing in particular was the thing that helped my sleep, then stopped

5. My sleep improved when I tried to raise my pillow with a 2nd one

6. Hypertrophic tongue

7. Daily cough and often some foods kinda ""block"" in the ""upper throat"", but it's difficult to explain this here, it can be a normal thing obviously😂. Probably narrow airway, who knows. Also tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy when I was a child, if this might be useful

8. Blocked nose as I should do the prick test for allergies

9. I became more arrogant in the morning especially before my coffees. But also more arrogant in general *as a result* of this _physical_ problem I have

10. I stayed at home some days as I was unable to be ""energic"" like to go outside, but this depended by my sleepiness. I like going outside

11. Microsleeps: these happen daily and especially if someone in my family has an argue with me and I, like, express the pressure this argument gives me with some quick microsleeps, moments I close my eyes because of sleepiness!

12. Sleep test claimed no apneas: isnt' UARS something similar to OSAS?

13. I don't have a life ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I was at university until the beginning of 2023. Then my life changed. I managed to study and workout until the middle of 2024, then it became more and more difficult.
I try to work remotely for my sister with some things on excel.. but I'm too slow as you might understand.


Now, I read someone saying he/she developed some weird/arrogant behaviours because of this, I can relate to this. In my family they say I'm crazy... but are the symptoms I listed useless to mention?

Good luck to everyone!

And sabi ni ategirl na dun lang din siya nag stay, and if gusto ko mag coffee kasama yung isa namin pang friend(lets name him F2) from college na nag stay somewhere near lang din naman. So sabi ko oks lets meet pero may imemeet muna ako kasi may plans ako beforehand, so mga around 8PM na lang kami mag coffee, so lahat nag confirm na. 

Then mga around 7:30 naka dating na ako sa place and sabi ni F1 malapit lang siya dun and punta na muna siya, pero si F2 kasi medyo natraffic so di muna kami nag order ng coffee, hinihintay kasi namin si F2 para sabay sabay na. Then while waiting sabi ni F1, invite niya daw roommate niya(lets name her, MC) kasi baka mag relapse daw kakabreak lang daw kasi.  So sabi ko okay lang kaso di ba baka ma OP siya samin kasi meron na kaming history na talagang malilikot kami e haha, sabi naman ni F1, okay lang para di naman siya mag isa sa bahay nila. btw yung matagal ko na palang sinasabi sa kanila na gusto kong maging gf ay yung balot na balot na parang muslim(sorry po sa muslim, not judging you po), and sinasabi nila bakit daw di na lang daw ako mag convert(sorry po).

Then MC came sa cafe, inintroduce ako ni F1, at first di naman ako attracted, napansin ko lang na parehas silang naka jacket e ang init init dito sa Man********, parehas lang nila akong binully. Smol talks here and there, pero shy boy ako di ako umiimik unless spoken to. Then si F2 naman dumating, and medyo nabully namin si F2 ng kung anong anong pang bubully. Long story short, i think nag enjoy naman si MC.

Then tomorrow came, nagyaya ako sa Pasig river esplanade kasi maganda daw dun, nag G naman silang 3. Pero sinundo ko muna sila kasi hindi daw nila alam pasikot sikot, not knowing na matagal na din pala dito sa manila si MC. Nung pagkasundo ko sa kanila, nakita ko si MC, balot na balot beh. Dito ko na napansin si MC na putangina ang cute, nag chat naman ako sa bestfriend ko from HS na sabi ko ""tangina ang cute ng ka room mate ni ano, balot na balot HAHA"". Idk pero from this point on nagkaroon na ako ng crush sa kanya, sabi ko sa sarili ko ""papa cute ako para astig ako"" HAHAHA ambobo. then nung otw namin dun onting joketime with F2 tapos tumatawa si MC, so cute. then binigay ko yung dala kong jissou lite para naman di mainitan sa byahe no gentleman ako. jk. then nung pag dating namin sa riverside sabi ni F1 mag open daw si MC para alam namin yung tea, pero sabi ko di pa ko nag didinner, sabi din naman ni MC siya din daw so bumili kami ng shawarma pero kami lang nag rice, si F1 and F2 nag pita wrap lang. then nag hanap kami ng pwesto, dun kami sa taas kasi may pwesto dun, pero si kuyang tindero ng shawarma, ako lang binigyan ng kutsara idk why pero apir kuya. so sabi ko kay MC, kaw na lang mag kutsara ako mag kakamay, pero nung nagkakamay na ako sabi sakin ni MC, balutin ko na lang daw ng plastic yung kutsara, ako si bobo di ko naisip agad HAHA nung gagawin ko na, biglang umulan, eh si F1 lang at si MC may payong, e since pita wrap lang kanila, mabilis sila naka likas haha tinulungan ko si MC mag balot nung fud niya sabi ko ""ako na magliligpit pero pahawak nung tubig and payungan mo ko pls"" then nag payong na siya pero sabi ko nga mahpapa cool ako kaya kinuha ko payong then pinayungan ko siya pabalik dun sa shawarma na pinag bilhan namin. little interactions with crush lang HAHA. pero hindi nakapag open si beh. saka lang siya nakapag open nung nakauwi kami kasi ampangit ng timing ko, tag ulan. haha

Then dun ko nalaman yung issue niya sa ex niya, then dun ko lang din nalaman na i think mas better kung friends na lang kami and hanggang crush ko na lang si MC, kasi i think she's still in love pa din dun kay guy. ew. sorry for the long post po, gusto ko lang ishare ang ka deluluhan ng isang probinsyano. pero i want to know her more, as a friend haha! sa readers, thank you sa pagbabasa, sa mga na cringe-an, sorry.

Forgive the limited details, I have only just started smelling things with intention. Neither of these companies ended up being right for me so the descriptions are consequently more limited than ones I love. I still have all these samples so I’m happy to have another sniff and give more detail if anyone has a specific intrigue. I don’t believe scents need to be male or female as I wear both but I will note if something leans more stereotypically masculine.

General preferences – Fruity, citrus, creamy or aquatic scents
Death notes – Patchouli, Smoke, Incense
Dislikes – Floral, Soapy, Powdery (normally) and that-classic-perfume-smell
I am very very picky about scents so there’s plenty of lovely perfumes that just didn’t grab me and it’s not a reflection on the company itself.

Both companies offer discovery collections with Abbey Perfumery offering a complete library set and Saltworks breaking theirs down into three collections. Both dispatched very quickly and came in nice presentation boxes. Saltworks included a booklet which had blank stars in under the scent descriptions so you could record your score as you sampled. Both also included testing strips.

ABBEY PERFUMERY

Overall – I think these just ended up being too classic perfume-y for me. They were lovely and delicate but just didn’t have anything that grabbed me.

Amber skies – Arabian Jamine, Cashmere, White Amber – Punchy but also not? Not for me 2/5

Woods of Oz – Cardamom, Violet, Sandalwood – Instant woods but then deepens with pepper. Not for me. Feels too young and/or green. 2.5/5

Kir Cashmere – Cassis, Neroli, Vanilla – Vanilla-ish classic floral perfume. 4/5

Joe Smooth – Arabica Cofffee, Jasmine, Vanilla – Barely get the coffee but it does feel like a masculine vanilla. Jasmine emerges over time and becomes a little more fem. Not for me. 3/5

Piper – Bergamot, Pink Pepper, Cedar Wood – Another quite classic smelling perfume but with a distinct pepper note. The bergamot and pepper came through quite strongly. Not for me. 2.5/5

May Flower – Bergamot, Jasmine, White Musk – Delicate floral peach that was very pretty but only lasted about 1.5 hrs on my skin. 2/5 due to fading

Bramble Smoke – Blackberry, Bulgarian Rose, Oud – Deep rich berry with a lift swirling around. Oud comes out most strongly but when sweating (hot girl summer) the berry comes back in with a punch. 4/5

Terra Mirus – Pineapple, Dry Birch, Leather – Strong, rich pineapple smell to start and then the birch/spice comes in very hard. 3.5/5

Oriental Rose – Mandarin, Rose, White Musk – Sweet rose which is very delicate and almost candy-like. It’s soft in the opening and then the rose comes into it’s own. For a rose scent it’s pretty but far too floral for me. 2/5.

SALTWORKS

Overall – Again a more predictable perfume range than other indies but some solid, strong options and they have a lovely large selection to choose from. Only real criticism is that I would rather have been able to select individual samples as I knew there were quite a few I wouldn’t like.

Alchemy – Clary Sage, White Pepper, Vetiver, Cedar – Wood shoots and delicate flowers, very pretty but not for me. 3.5/5

De La Mer – Sea Water, Rosemary, Citrus – Lemon Sea breeze, I would follow citrus Poseidon in a crowd if I smelled this on a person. 4.5/5

Dive - Water Accord, Basil, Lavender, Eucalyptus – This somehow smells like masculine spicy sea after rain. 3.5/5

Figaro – Bergamot, Ita.lian Fig, Cedar Wood – I’m not sure how much this smells like delicate wood and mint lemonade. 4/5

L’eau Tropicale – Guava, Apple, Blue Water Musk – Tropical melody, somehow bubbly with the apple detectable throughout. Didn’t have the best throw of the bunch but gorgeous smells with blue water and guava staying strong for 5 hours. 4.75/5 (sue me for the .75!)

Neroliandre – Bergamot, Neroli, Oleander – smelt like green soap, quite a light smell but instant reject for me. 2/5

Ocean Drive – Cardamom, Calone, Cypress Wood – Lime citrus rind, wasn’t for me. 3/5

Rainstorm – Sweet Cicely, Rainwater, Iris, Guaiac – It’s a peppery saltwater smell so they’ve got the atmospheric side of it down. It somehow smells like the concept of absence?! 3/5

Sicilia – Sicilian Lemon, Sicilian Cypress, Bamboo, Apple, Musk – Smells like fresh grass, bamboo, apple and lemon. 3.5/5

Summer Daze – Peach, Bergamot, Cadamom, Musk – Warm golden perfume. Very Intriguing, will need to retry because while I didn’t fall in love I kept sniffing at it. 3.5/5 for now

Carmen – Black Cherry, Corriander, Saffron, Leather, Fir Balsam, Ambergris – My notes for the opening say ‘Feminine mystique’ and for closing say ‘Leafy Cherry’. 3/5

Freesome – Apple, Sea Kelp, Freesia, Lily, Cedar, Musk – Aquatic apple, slight too blue smelling for me (the colour not the emotion) 3/5

Gypsy Rose – Rose, Cinnamon, Bay Leaf, Cassis, Rosewood, Oakmoss - Floral and Musky. 2/5

Hanami Blossom – Melon, Cherry, Cherry Blossom, Cassis, Musk, Cedar – Quite fresh melon-y cherry scent. 3/5

Hay Jude – Pear, Hay, Violet Leaf, Vanilla, Tonka Bean, Iris – I was excited for the pear in this but sadly the violet was quite strong and it ended up being powdery/soapy. 2/5

Jasmine Est – Petitgratin, Bergamot, Vanilla, Jasmine, Fragipani, Caramel, Patchouli – Just straight up vanilla marzipan and patchouli. I regret my choices with this. 1/5

Lilypond Pear – Pear, Melon, Freesia, Waterlily, Musk – I somehow got Apple from this, a lovely fresh apple. Very reminiscent of Apple Head and Shoulders Shampoo. 3.5/5 but might revisit this one.

Violet Dew – Raspberry, Grapefruit, Bamboo, Hyacinth, Cut Grass, Vanilla, Iris- Just cut grass, bamboo and powdery palma violets. 1/5

Whitelight – Black Pepper, Violet Leaf, Tuberose, Ylang-Ylang, Amber, Lamdanum – Peppery warmth with a background floral note. 2/5

Windsong – Sea Kelp, Bergamot, Peony, Cassis, Rose, Vanilla, Sandalwood – Floral. All floral. Too much floral. Not for me. 1/5

Brown Sugar – Peach, Molasses, Almond, Amber – I’m getting the molasses and deepening amber but where are my promised peaches? 2.5/5

Ko Meme – Ripe Pear, Praline, Incense – Finally found the pear! This has a really classic perfume aroma flavoured with pear. 3/5

Lady Marmalade – Patchouli, Lime Leaf, Cedarwood – Strong lime. Not sure I’d ever want to smell this strongly of lime but might be up someone’s alley. 3/5

L’orangerie – Juicy Orange, Sicilian Lemon, Musk – Just straight lemon rind really. Where’s the orange? 3/5

Surfari – Bergamot, Apple, Sea Cotton, Black Coconut, Jasmine, Vanilla, Sandalwood – Vanilla coconut which makes me think of a cheap sweet, quite a powdery scent. 2.5/5

Oud Bazaar – Oud, Rose, Pink Pepper, Leather – my notes read ‘Oud and floral. Oof’. Not for me. 1/5

Oud Harmony – Oud, Amber, Saffron, Rosewater – Rosewater oud, a similar crashout for me. 1/5

Rose Boheme – Bergamot, Rose, Patchoui, Oud – For some reason I have a really strong scent memory of a dentists office. YMMV. 1/5

Tabac Soleil – Lemon, Vanilla Tobacco Flower, Tonka Bean, Tobacco Leaf – My notes read ‘Just no. Tobacco spiced christmas pudding’. 1/5

BONUS REVIEWS
SOKI LONDON (I believe this counts as niche not indie)

Aphrodite – Mango, Lotus Flower, Palm Leaves, Coconut – Really creamy mango like a mango-colada. Adore this and bought a travel size of this. 4.75/5

Artemis – Peach, Nectarine, Plum, Osmanthus, Green Leaves, Sandalwood, Cedar - Woody peach/plum, very pleasant but not sure how often I’d reach for it. 4/5

WOLFBERRYRITUALS

I enjoy coffee a great deal, so much so that i give myself heart palpitations from too much of it at times. 

I suffer from headaches that have not been officially diagnosed as migraines by my neurologist who claims there is nothing wrong but they're frequent and appear more the more fatigued I am.

The first week I had quite severe headaches and was concerned about it, but trusted that this would subside, which it did. I don’t recall this ever happening again even when I increased the dosage.

First few days I felt a little high. It was quite nice, but I knew this would pass and that it’s not something to chase.

Probably a tendency to clench my jaw a bit more than usual, and so chewing gum occasionally helps. But it isn’t dreadful.

Alcohol. I am not a huge drinker anyway, but it definitely makes me feel drunk more quickly. A pint or two I will really feel the effects, so I will avoid drinking when on the meds, except the occasional pint.

Occasional anxiety, but that could be unrelated. It may be heightened when combing with caffeine. I cut caffeine out (except for a bit of tea) for 3 months, which helped, but I’ve allowed coffee to creep back in. I don’t think it’s having any major impact.

Sometimes crashing later in the day (one reason for trying a higher dosage) but it’s a bit hit-and-miss, so could be any number of factors.

__The positive effects:__

Better emotional regulation and less reactive (so overall a little calmer). 

Far less impulsive, which plays into many things, such as not wasting money, better dietary choices, being a bit more careful with that I say, etc. 

Less inclined to get dragged into negative thinking patterns. My mind doesn’t seem a lot quieter, it’s still pretty hyper in there, but I’ve noticed that I am not being pulled into negative thinking so much. I guess negative self-talk has lessened, too. 

Have been far more likely to exercise and stick with a routine and to eat far healthier. 

Less resistance to chores, boring tasks, things that seem difficult, and things that once would give me that ‘urgh’ feeling and make me avoid them or delay. 

Focus — I can get into good periods of focus time with things I would often struggle with (see above), _providing_ that I plan accordingly. The focus can definitely be put on the wrong thing and sometimes I’ve felt trapped in something that is unproductive or a waste of time (scrolling on social media, etc). 

It seems that very slowly I am becoming more organised. I am doing the things that I have put off for a long time, literally years in some cases, such as clearing out/selling/donating things I no longer need (I don’t feel any desire to fill the space with other unnecessary clutter). Also, gradually getting on top of admin, improvements in work organisation, which hopefully leads to fewer missed opportunities (I’ve lost a lot of work due to disorganisation, forgetfulness, etc). 

Acceptance — have struggled with accepting I may have ADHD ever since I realised this could be me, and even following diagnosis. However, that is shifting and perhaps part of that is down to noticing the positive changes that medication has made for me so far. 

It hasn’t seemed to affect my sleep. If anything, I’d say, sleep is actually improved. 

__Advice I can think of right now:__

Keep well hydrated as these medications seem to make you dehydrated (I often use the hydration tablets/sachets). 

Avoid other stimulants, if possible, and alcohol. 

I found that eating protein when taking the meds seems to make it more effective. As someone who struggles to eat first thing, I tend to use a protein or meal-replacement shake. 

__Provider:__

I went with ADHD360 (via Right To Choose) and my experience with them has been wholly positive, especially when I compare to what others report about some of the other providers. After diagnosis, I had medications within a couple of weeks. There has been a review at the end of each titration period and I have had no periods where I’ve had to wait without any medication. 
I did question why they seemed to keep increasing the dose, however I then understood that this is titration, they listened to what I was reporting, which was the positive effects but perhaps still a little room for improvement. I was advised too that I can always split the dose if I felt it was too much (I did this when I tapered off the medication to attend a festival). 
I am now at the end of titration and happy to stick with 70mg for now. They are going to contact my GP to see if they will take on the prescription, but if not then ADHD360 will continue to prescribe and they will do a review annually. They also said that I can go back to them at any point if I feel the effects of the medication ever changes (even if I am now under care of the GP).   

__Conclusion:__

I really think that getting on the medication has been profound for me. Many of the changes are quite subtle, but when I reflect, as I have done above, it’s clear that there are a lot of positives. Of course, I am prepared to admit that my body may gradually get used to it and it will become less effective, but for now I will continue to take it. Any long-term effects concerns me a little (I am not sure if there are any), but as it improves my life right now, then I see that as a price easily worth paying. 
I will be prescribed 70mg for the time being, but I may at some point experiment with lowering the dosage and seeing if I can maintain the positive effects. 

Again, apologies for the long post (I appreciate a lot of you may look away in disgust, ha), but hopefully it’s useful to somebody and I would welcome any conversation about your own experiences. ✌️",3,1752933014.0,ADHDUK,4,1.0,False

Using the Bean Envy LLTIFP03 Pour Over Coffee Maker in my daily coffee routine has changed the way I view my morning cup of joe. Pour-over brewing has this almost magical ability to extract the best flavors from coffee grounds, and this sleek, stylish coffee maker delivers that experience consistently. The stainless steel, paperless filter caught my eye right away because I’ve always disliked the waste that comes with single-use filters. This wasn't just a coffee maker; it felt like a step in the right direction for someone who cares about sustainable choices.

The aesthetics of this coffee brewer are spot-on. It features a borosilicate glass carafe that’s not only heat-resistant but also visually stunning. It looks impressive sitting on my countertop and adds a touch of sophistication to the kitchen. The addition of the silicone sleeve around the carafe bottom felt like a thoughtful touch. It provides a better grip and reduces the risk of accidental spills, which is something I truly appreciate.

**Professional-Quality Brewing Without the Barista**

Testing out this brewing method made me feel like a barista in my own home. The process was easy to follow and offered a level of control over my coffee that other methods usually don’t. To use this coffee maker, I would rinse the reusable micro-mesh filter with hot water, add my preferred medium-ground coffee, and slowly pour hot water using a gooseneck kettle. From there, the setup worked like magic—perfectly regulating the water flow and turbulence, thereby producing a bold, aromatic cup each time.

The reusable stainless-steel filter is a standout feature—laser cut and engineered for optimum filtration, it allowed coffee oils to pass through without letting any sediment sneak in. Not only did it deliver rich flavor, but it also eliminated the need to juggle between disposable filters, saving me both money and effort in the long run.

**Strengths**

- Allows full-bodied, aromatic coffee to shine.  
- Sleek design with durable, heat-resistant borosilicate glass.  
- Reusable stainless steel filter eliminates waste and extra purchases.  
- Silicone sleeve prevents accidental slips or countertop stains.  

**Limitations**

- Requires close attention to the pouring process for better results.  
- Not ideal for large groups since the carafe capacity is limited to 5 cups.  

**The Flavor Factor: Coffee Enthusiasts Will Love It**

The standout trait here was the flavor—strong, bold, and deeply aromatic. I experimented with different coffee grounds and grind sizes during my time with this product, and it handled all varieties beautifully. However, if you’re the type who doesn’t have time to babysit your pour-over or prefer a push-of-a-button solution, this might not be the right fit for you. Its manual operation requires more active precision compared to automatic machines but rewards you with an unmatched tasting note depth.

**Helpful Features That Set It Apart**

What truly makes this product unique are the small details. Besides brew performance, the thoughtful design comes through in its ease of cleaning. Both the borosilicate glass and the stainless steel filter are a cinch to rinse out after each use. Its compact height and width (8.5""x5.25"") means it fits into my kitchen cabinets snugly when not in use—a major bonus for someone limited on counter space.

**Product Comparisons**

Compared to fellow pour-over brewers like the Chemex, this coffee maker takes the lead for sustainability with its reusable filter. Chemex, while iconic, relies on paper filters, creating waste and requiring regular purchases. Additionally, the silicone grip on the Bean Envy product offers more functionality and practicality than Chemex’s wooden collar, which needs occasional oiling to stay intact. However, Chemex might have an edge for those who prefer an oversized capacity; the Bean Envy model's 5-cup limit can be restrictive for heavy coffee drinkers or families.

Brands like Bodum or Hario also make excellent contenders, but they fall behind in combining sleek design with user-friendly features. The Bean Envy model strikes a balance that feels just a notch above, especially in delivering consistent results.

**Value Proposition**

I’ve considered other options in its price range, and in terms of cost efficiency, this coffee brewer is impressively well-rounded for what it offers. While some might consider it a splurge compared to simpler press-style devices, the long-term benefits of opting for a reusable filter and high-quality build justify the investment. It delivers professional results minus the recurring additional costs.

It's not every day you stumble upon a product that makes brewing coffee feel like an art form, but the Thang Long SYNCHKG077062 Vietnamese Coffee Filter certainly fits that bill. As someone who takes coffee seriously (to an almost ritualistic level), this little brewer has quickly earned a spot in my morning routine. Designed to provide the perfect Vietnamese-style coffee, it combines simplicity, durability, and efficiency in surprisingly effective ways.

**Design and Build Quality**

What struck me first was how solid this filter feels. Crafted from high-quality stainless steel, it looks sleek, has a modern vibe, and feels like it’s built to last. At 3.7 inches wide and only 2.6 inches tall, the compact size makes it easy to store in small spaces, ideal for people like me who are short on kitchen real estate. The included gravity insert is arguably the star of the show. Unlike the traditional screw-down filters that tend to leak or require fiddling, this one works effortlessly. Also, the lack of additional components makes cleaning much simpler. Plus, it's dishwasher safe, which is always a win in my book.

**Ease of Use**

The setup couldn’t be easier. You simply add a scoop of Vietnamese ground coffee, pour in hot water, and let gravity do its thing. Since the filter is manual, there’s no need for buttons, timers, or electricity—perfect for those who want a low-maintenance brewing process. While it might take a bit longer to drip compared to a Keurig, the reward is undeniable: rich, bold coffee that’s nothing short of delicious. As someone who’s traveled to Vietnam, this brings back memories of sipping authentic café sua da by the streets of Saigon.

[Check Thang Long SYNCHKG077062 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01953yt1i/)

**Positives of This Coffee Filter**

- High-quality stainless steel ensures longevity.  
- Gravity insert eliminates the need for tricky screw mechanisms.  
- Dishwasher safe for hassle-free cleaning.  
- Produces authentic Vietnamese-style coffee effortlessly.  
- Super lightweight at just 4.4 ounces, great for travel.

**Performance and Taste**

Does it brew great coffee? Yes, 100%! The slow-drip mechanism extracts every bit of flavor from the grounds, resulting in a cup that is full-bodied and aromatic. I tested the filter with Trung Nguyen ground coffee, and the results were impressively close to what I had experienced in Vietnam—smooth, with just the right amount of bitterness. Its capacity (8 oz) makes just enough for one person, though brewing another round for a second cup is quick enough.

On hot summer days, I’ve experimented with pouring the brew over ice to make the classic café sua da. Adding condensed milk creates a sweet, creamy treat that’s hard to beat. My family loves it when I serve this at brunches, and even my “coffee-snob” coworker had to admit it was a game-changer.

**Negatives of This Coffee Filter**

- The 8oz capacity might feel limiting for larger households or multiple users.  
- Brewing takes time, and patience is key—this isn’t for someone looking for instant coffee.  
- Thin metal handles can get hot to the touch if the filter is handled too soon.  

**Materials and Durability**

The all-stainless steel construction is impressive, especially for the price point. The filter shows no signs of rust or wear, and I’ve already put it through dozens of brewing cycles. The laser-cut precision of the filter holes ensures no grounds sneak into your coffee. While lighter than expected, it's surprisingly sturdy and keeps its shape despite frequent use.

**Co-existing with Competing Products**

I’ve tested competitors like French presses and single-serve coffee makers, but this filter delivers a unique experience. Compared with French presses, it offers less cleanup and no need for plunging the coffee grounds. Unlike electric machines, which can disconnect you from the brewing process, this manual option makes you more involved, which I personally love. While it doesn’t compare to the convenience of one-touch devices, it takes the win in terms of taste and authenticity. For those seeking an alternative cultural approach to making coffee, this is hard to beat.

**Financial Value**

In terms of cost efficiency, this coffee filter scores highly. Some coffee-making devices require pods, which can drain your wallet over time. However, the Thang Long model uses good old ground coffee, saving both money and the environment. Think about it—no costly replacements or future upgrades; this is low-maintenance brewing at its finest.

After lots of research and measuring, I learned some really useful guidelines that I want to share.

The ideal height for a coffee table should be within 1-2 inches of your sofa's seat height. Most standard coffee tables are between 16-18 inches tall, while the average sofa seat height is around 17-19 inches. This creates a comfortable reach when you're seated and maintains good proportions in the room.

I made the mistake of getting a too-tall coffee table before, and it was awkward reaching for drinks or putting my feet up. Through trial and error, I discovered that the sweet spot is usually around 16-18 inches - this height works perfectly with most couches and sectionals.

While browsing for my new coffee table (I found some great options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables), I learned that the height also depends on how you plan to use the table. If you mainly use it for drinks and decor, stick to standard height. But if you work from your couch often, you might want something slightly taller, around 20 inches.

Here are some key factors I considered:

- Room size: Larger rooms can handle taller tables
- Sofa style: Modern sofas tend to sit lower than traditional ones
- Usage: Consider what activities you'll do at the table
- Visual balance: The table shouldn't overpower or disappear next to your seating

If you're still unsure about measurements, I found an excellent selection of coffee tables in various heights here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables. They include detailed dimensions so you can find the perfect fit.

For reference, here are some common coffee table heights based on sofa types:

Low-profile sofas (15-17"" seat height): 14-16"" coffee table
Standard sofas (17-19"" seat height): 16-18"" coffee table
Higher sofas (20""+ seat height): 18-20"" coffee table

Remember that these are guidelines, not strict rules. The most important thing is finding a height that feels comfortable for your specific setup and needs. Measure your current furniture and consider how you'll use the space before making a final decision.

From my experience, getting the height right makes a huge difference in both comfort and appearance. Take the time to measure and choose carefully - your perfect coffee table is out there!",1,1752932375.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

we were just coworkers. never crossed a line. i never did anything bold, and i have a boyfriend. i don't even know if he has someone. but something about the way he treated me… it left a mark.

we were hired the same time, around two years ago. at first, i didn’t really pay attention to him. but eventually, during company events, he would start messaging me, asking me to join or come along. we slowly became close — just as friends — but there were little moments that lingered. like how he’d sometimes stutter when i greeted him in the hallway. or how we’d randomly chat on ms teams, just casual convos here and there. he would randomly look for me ask ask me where i am and i do too to him.

one time, he even walked me to my uber after work. more recently, he started messaging me after we both got home. not always but most of the time we would talk even after our shifts but i would usually cut the conversation because I'm scared where it might lead us, what if his intentions are just to test me and i get really sleepy. our last chat was playful — we were teasing each other, and i asked if he was still in the office. he said, “why, are we going to see each other?” and i replied, “come in tomorrow if you want to see me.” he joked back, “can’t we see each other outside of work?” i said, “let’s talk next time.” because i was scared. when he got home he would say ""i got home, are you still up?"" i stopped replying to set boundaries even though i wanted to talk to him more.

we did end up talking again, and he asked me out for coffee. i turned it down since it was already late at night (his shift ends at 10pm), but it made me wonder — why did he ask me out that late?

i’ve also noticed lately that he’s been working on himself. going to the gym, eating healthy — he really looks different now. but honestly, even before all that, when he was still chubby, i already had a crush on him. and now, i just don’t know what to do with these feelings. i can't tell anyone. not even him.

and with me leaving, the sadness is heavier than i expected. it’s like this quiet grief. he used to joke that he’d resign first and tease me that i’d miss him. but now i’m really the one leaving — and he doesn’t even know yet. all of this is just overwhelming and i feel like i will keep thinking if he liked me or what could have been.",1,1752932371.0,Crushes,3,1.0,False

I didn't feel so blah. Although I was chilling still, I didn't feel glued to the couch. I could easily get up to get whatever from the next room, do a quick chore, or whatever.

1m3wfaa,https://i.redd.it/zwbc3r7e3udf1.jpeg,The dry down of Glazed Pumpkin. . . Blush Cardigan vibes??,"First off, Glazed Pumpkin is definitely the powerhouse of the fall 1 collection. Even more so than Vanilla Cafe and Rich Espresso!

It was going strong after three hours of wear. And I can smell it subtly on my skin next day fourteen hours later. I think I only sprayed it like twice. If you want a scent that rivals powerhouses like Vanilla Romance in strength (despite being a totally different scent), I think this is it. 

Scent notes for Glazed Pumpkin are:
> Vanilla glaze, caramel woods and pumpkin cream. 

I had a difficult time describing it yesterday as it was intermingling with other strong scents are sprayed (but mixing pretty well—I think it’ll layer nicely with Vanilla Cafe and Rich Espresso). I ended up describing it like Starbucks aura. Warm, glowing, creamy, toasty. 

But as it was drying down like 20-30 minutes later, I kept wondering what that sugary musky scent was as it shifted into something that was reminding me of Blush Cardigan. 

Scents notes for Blush Cardigan:
> Sweet raspberries, sugar dipped violet, warm amber. 

I swear this year’s SAS version Blush Cardigan (I haven’t smelled previous, but heard this year’s was sweeter) also has a caramel note. And that I feel is the link between Glazed Pumpkin and Blush Cardigan. 

I think these two scents are different. Maybe like cousins or even second cousins. But they do meet in the middle somewhere, to my nose. In the dry down. 

If the dry down of Glazed Pumpkin developed into something a little darker, less sweet, not raspberry, I think it would be the beginning point of Blush Cardigan. 

I don’t know if I’ll do an 180 on this once I get the chance to smell Glazed Pumpkin alone. But for now I think Blush Cardigan lovers might like the dry down of Glazed Pumpkin. 

Actually Vanilla Cafe is also a shifter. And also turns into a sugar crystal musk. It loses much of its coffee creamer quality. Try letting that one dry down like 20-30 minutes on skin too and see how you like it. ",1,1752932197.0,bathandbodyworks,0,0.67,False
1m3wf87,https://i.redd.it/buvzge5u2udf1.png,Ember Travel Mug Aliexpress Version???,"Firstly, I'd like to say this is not an advertisement for the product I'd just love to know more about it.  
  
After owning the Ember Travel Mug 2, I found this pop-up on my AliExpress homepage and noticed it looked quite similar to my Travel Mug. I had a little bit of more in-depth look-up and realised it shared quite a few similarities, in terms of doc matrix screen and the infamously terrible ""Leak-proof"" lid. Some of these similarities you can really only see after owning the physical product, like how the lid looks from the inside, etc.

Not sure if this is the China-based company that actually manufactures the mugs for Ember, selling them as a stripped-down manufacturer version, as the AliExpress listing mentions nothing about an app.

Just thought it would be interesting to post here to see if anyone else has any insights regarding, is this legit?, If anyone's actually bought an AliExpress version? and possibly how it compares to the real thing.

Love to hear from you all.

Also, for some reason reddit will not let me directly link to AliExpress, however if you do an AliExpress image search on the photo provided you should be able to find multiple listings for the same product, I believe one of them has a video showing how it works.",2,1752932192.0,Ember,0,1.0,False

It's a common practice - you boil water, forget about it, and then reboil it later. But is this actually safe?

After doing some research, I found that reboiling water in an electric kettle is generally safe, but there are a few things to keep in mind.

First, the main concern with reboiling water is that it can concentrate certain minerals and compounds. When water boils, some of it evaporates, leaving behind a more concentrated solution. This isn't usually harmful, but it can affect the taste of your tea or coffee.

One myth I came across is that reboiling water creates dangerous compounds. This isn't true for most tap water. The minerals in tap water are stable and don't become harmful when reboiled.

However, if you're using water from a well or an area with high mineral content, repeated boiling might lead to scale buildup in your kettle. This isn't dangerous, but it can shorten your kettle's lifespan.

Another point to consider is energy efficiency. Reboiling water uses more electricity than boiling fresh water, so it's not the most eco-friendly habit.

So, what's the best practice? I'd recommend only boiling as much water as you need each time. This saves energy and ensures you're always using fresh water. If you do need to reboil, it's generally safe, but try not to make it a regular habit.

Speaking of electric kettles, I recently upgraded mine and it's made a big difference. I found a great selection of efficient, reliable kettles at https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. They have options that heat water quickly and keep it at the perfect temperature, which has really improved my tea and coffee routine.

In conclusion, while reboiling water in an electric kettle isn't dangerous, it's best to use fresh water when possible. It's better for taste, energy efficiency, and the longevity of your kettle. And remember, a good quality kettle can make all the difference in your hot beverage experience.",1,1752931947.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False
1m3wbr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fusion360/comments/1m3wbr0/making_an_open_source_plug_and_play_lever/,Making an Open source Plug and Play Lever Espresso Machine,"So, I sometimes do coffee pop ups, where it's difficult to carry an espresso machine due to technical limitations. So I was looking for some options for manual lever espresso machine, like Flair. Most of them are pretty good, but I feel there is lack of standardisation in the options available.

For a simple non-electric mechanical machine, the prices are very inflated, I guess because getting a lever espresso machine is generally passion driven purchase. I mean on one hand, we have stuff like Aeropress, which is simple, highly customisable, gives great level of control, and is so affordable. And then we have all these lever espresso machines, priced unreasonably high for a piston, lever and a group head, and almost all the options would lack customisability. If you want more features, you buy their premium models. So I am designing my own Lever espresso machine, in Fusion 360. The goal is to have the following features -

1. **Piston Mounts** \- The piston, that pushes the water out at 6-9 bar of pressure, be either customisable (or replaceable). For example, one of the mounts can, with the use of hydraulics, multiply the pressure by 2. So if you use that mount, you will have the press longer, but for the same force applied, you might have twice the output pressure. Some other mount might have a spring attached, which softens the pressure applied, giving smooth or delayed pressure output. This way, with the use of different piston mounts, people can customise the pressure output.
2. **Choice of pressure guage** \- I would personally be building a small digital module that connects to my phone and let me visualise the pressure profile (pressure applied over time during a single press), so that I can practice different styles, but someone else might want to have a simple traditional pressure guage connected to their press. The idea is to have a place/hole where pressure guage can be mounted, and the community can choose what device they want to use. Options are limitless.
3. **Should be compatible with standard 58mm portafilter** \- I know there is no standard when it comes to portafilter, and we can't account for all types of portafilters, but I don't want to have some crazy design here that limits the type of portafilter to those of very specific styles.
4. **Lever position lock** \- Not that important for customisation, but it is a feature I want to have. Having an easy way to lock and unlock the lever angle.
5. **It should be simple yet beautiful** \- I always appreciate the simplicity of a french press, pour overs or an Aeropress. Some lever espresso machines too are simple, but some like Flair lose their charm with their (I don't know how to put it otherwise) - lack of simplicity in their design. Also, I want to clarify, by this, I don't mean that I want this design to be lacking in functionality. If a complicated gear system does a really good job in giving a really really good UX, it should be a part of the design, but it should not lock people out of options/customisability where it might be important.

The thing is - I ABSOLUTELY SUCK at Fusion 360. Because I have never used it in my life. And I am an electronics engg grad, but am absolutely clueless when it comes to the jargons used in mechanical engg. So sometimes, I am stuck because I don't know how to search for the kind of solution I want to implement.

So, this is where I need the community to step in. I would love if you all, coffee nerds (and possibly design geniuses) can help me here, making the dream lever espresso machine, so that anyone can use the design, or take inspiration from it, and manufacture it locally.

Nordale sat back, nodding acquiescence. He wasn’t ready to answer that yet. “Do you feel

able to continue?”

Iain didn’t answer, just continued his narration of the events.



I woke the following morning feeling drugged. I crawled towards the tent entrance yet

paused, one hand on the zip, as a feeling of uneasiness – threat? – assailed me. I crawled

out of the fug of my tent, knife in hand expecting morning freshness, yet the air was heavy,

polluted. I rapidly boiled the kettle on the stove, craving caffeine. Richard soon emerged,

equally on edge, glancing around warily as I proffered him a cup of coffee. “You look like I

feel,” I said.

“Couldn’t sleep. When I did, had weird dreams… Feel knackered,” he yawned, gulping down

coffee.

Bryan, similarly tired and on edge, grumbled, “So come on, then, what did you decide last

night? What did you find?”

We stared at him, bewildered.

“I heard you both talking – you needn’t pretend – but I wasn’t answering you nor coming out

at that time of night!” He glowered at us both, clearly annoyed.

“Bryan,” I answered, hesitantly, “neither of us called for you to come out. We were asleep.

We have both literally been awake for minutes. You must have been dreaming?”

“One of you shook my tent! I heard you calling me to come out! So if this is your idea of a

joke, you can bloody drop it!“

Alastair, clearly woken by our noise, also crawled out of his tent.

Bryan turned to him. “You must have heard them, your tent is next to mine!” he snapped.

“Unless you’re in on it…. Bloody whispering and calling half the night long…”



Alastair simply looked bewildered. “Bryan – why would any of us do that? Be reasonable –

sure, you must have been dreaming. Too much whisky?” he suggested lightly, turning to

rezip the doorway to his tent.

Bryan seized his shoulder, spinning him around so that he fell and had to scramble

inelegantly to his feet. “Don’t bloody patronize me, I know what I heard!” he yelled into

Alastair’s shocked face.

In the next instant, Richard was between them, squaring up to Bryan, who knew better than

to try to get past him. “Get a grip, Bry! Nothing happened!”

Bryan sat down sullenly, near the stove. I passed him coffee, but he remained silent and

morose, setting the tone for the morning.

We ate, packed up camp and set off once more, still in convoy, but with Bryan pushing the

pace so that although remaining in sight, he was out of earshot, clearly unwilling to

converse.

We walked throughout the morning, each of us focused on the march ahead of us,

constantly looking around us in search of anything that might inform our direction, anything

to indicate that David and his party had passed that way.

Alastair was concerned that he had somehow caused the dissent amongst us but I was

quick to reassure him that he was in no way to blame. “I don’t think I have ever known Bryan

to apologise,” I said, “but believe me, when he’s ready he’ll just drop it and carry on as

though nothing had happened.”

The words were hardly out of my mouth when Bryan turned and called back, “Alastair – can I

borrow your bino’s?”

Alastair quickly walked over to oblige him and stared through the binoculars fixedly for a

moment. He passed them back to Alastair: “Have a look – is that a bright colour at eleven

o’clock? Like – maybe the fabric of a tent?”

Alastair looked, nodded agreement and we hastened through the undergrowth in that

direction. We neared a small, natural clearing where a quantity of fabric lay puddled on the

ground, almost concealed from sight in a dip in the rutted land.

I ran ahead, breaking all of the practices instilled in my head through years of practice, in my

anxiety to find any evidence of David or Junior. “David!” I yelled, stumbling into what had

clearly been a campsite. My eagerness was soon subdued by the realization that this was an

old campsite: no sign of life remained.

Worse was to come. The fabric of a second tent was wrapped and secured firmly around

what was distinctly a body-shaped mound.

I flung myself to my knees beside it and, with trembling hands, my heart thudding painfully in

my chest, I carefully unwrapped the head. Or what had been the head.

Like the deer, this was a contorted, desiccated – almost mummified, face, its mouth frozen in

a silent rictus. I heard Alastair gasp, horrified.

“Is that our boy?” Richard asked sombrely.

The face was unrecognizable, the brow discoloured by a blackish mark similar to that which

we had seen on the deer. I cautiously unwrapped the body a little further until I could see the



neck of a cagoule. The back of the collar showed the manufacturer’s logo. And a name tag.

Booth. These were the remains of the ill-fated naturalist…

I exhaled, the immediate anxiety for my family removed. But the fear returned almost

instantly. If this had happened to Booth, had the same fate befallen them? And… what had

transformed a living man into this empty husk? Nothing I had ever experienced or heard of

could make sense of what I was seeing, and I had seen far too many bodies over the years.

“Iain – take a look at this!” Bryan called out. He was kneeling by the coolbox. He had

removed its lid to find that it contained only a thick layer, some inches deep, of dust. The

wrappers, however, indicated that it had been food. Certainly, roughly three weeks could

have passed since they were here – but that could in no way explain this extraordinary

condition – not in a sealed cooling box – let alone explain the state of the body.

Alastair, his face white with shock, was turning on his radio with trembling hands. Although

physically strong, his role had never called on him to do more than caution inconsiderate

hikers. “I have to call this in! This needs the police – someone with more authority than us!”

he exclaimed. We saw the power indicator on his radio flicker greenly for a few seconds –

then fade to nothing. No efforts on Alastair’s part could return it to action. “These were new

batteries yesterday,” he spluttered, confused. “They should be good for at least a week! That

settles it: with no radio, we need to head back to base and wait for assistance.”

“You can return, if you must. I’m not leaving,” I insisted.

Bryan and Richard, doubt on their faces, clearly thought that Alastair’s argument had some

merit.

“Can’t you see? The state of this – “I gestured towards the body – “David and Junior have

been out here so long already - I can’t go back – I can’t risk not staying and at least trying to

find them!”

“We have to regroup at the checkpoint,” Bryan reasoned. “Iain – I know what you’re thinking,

mate, but don’t be stupid. This is an operation. You know we have to regroup. The team

stays together,” Bryan quietly insisted.

Richard placed his hand on my shoulder in a mute gesture of understanding, then firmly and

insistently pulled me to my feet to start the return.

“Look, leave them a note in case they return,” Bryan suggested. “Tell them, if they have

returned here, to stay put and wait for us.”

Reluctantly, but given no real choice, I did as I was ordered, then with heavy heart followed

them back on to the trail by which we had arrived. We left water and some dried rations

behind us. In case.

Sometimes I hate Bryan’s calm logic. I knew he was right: I also knew I wasn’t going back.

A knock on the door disturbed Iain’s account; Sergeant Nicholls entered the room and

whispered into Nordale’s ear.

Nordale swore, as she left the room. “My apologies Iain, I need to attend to this matter…

would you be OK to come back tomorrow maybe? Same time?”

Iain shuffled in his chair, then nodded. “Uh… yeah, sure. I have time I think…”

Nordale shook Iain’s hand and apologized again before leaving the interview room.

“You OK, sir?” Sergeant Nicholls asked.

“Yeah… just, his hand was freezing…” Nordale mumbled. He looked back down the corridor

at the former soldier lifelessly wheeling his chair out of the interview room.



The following day Nordale sat impatiently in the interview room, cooling coffees ignored on

the desk. Iain was late. Bored and frustrated, Nordale ate his own sandwich, then devoured

the one intended for Iain.

When eventually his anticipated visitor arrived, his physical condition had seemingly

worsened – his movement of the chair seemed lethargic, exhausted.

“Forgive my lateness,” Iain said, his face gaunt and grey.

“Do you need me to get you some help?” Nordale asked, gazing at Iain’s decaying state.

“Er… some food?” he added, guiltily.



“I couldn’t face anything just now, thanks…” Iain chuckled, weakly.

Nordale shifted in his chair. “I meant to ask – your friends – where did you meet?”

Iain smiled, sadly. “You know, ever since I was little, Bryan and Richard were always there

for me. We’ve been our own squad, as it were, from five years old. Me and Richard were

neighbours, and our mothers raised us together taking turns to feed us, looking after us…

the whole works. David, my brother, would always tag along. When we started going to

nursery we met Bryan. He was a sickly, nervous child, being raised by his grandparents

because his mother couldn’t cope. Mine and Richard’s families kind of semi-adopted him

and he then became part of the furniture. Bryan, despite his faults, has been there for me to

dig me out of trouble, no matter what it was. I would give everything for us to just be those

daft, carefree kids one more time.” Iain’s eyes seemed misty with unshed tears. “When

Junior was born, David and Marie weren’t prepared for him: money was always tight, they

had no baby things, not even a cot. When I brought them home, we discovered that Bryan

had decorated the spare bedroom to make a nursery and he’d bought almost everything

they needed – probably bankrupting himself in the process.” He slumped wearily in his

wheelchair. “That’s the memory I cling to,” he stated, his face contorted by grief. His

shoulders shook, as if he were crying, but no tears ran down his face.

“Honestly Iain, there is no pressure to do this,” Nordale stated quietly.

“No!” Iain rasped. “I need to do this.”

Nordale adjusted his position on the hard chair then simply nodded and started the

recording.



O’Donnell, I: Session three.

So, I will re-stress, I did as I was ordered, then with a heavy heart followed them back on to

the trail by which we had arrived. We left water and some dried rations behind us for if my

brother or nephew were somewhere out there still.

Our conversation had all but died on our way back towards our first camp site. I had stormed

off ahead of the rest of the group to navigate – I needed to feel more in control – but I admit

that in that moment I felt betrayed by Bryan and Richard; I needed to find my family, dead or

alive.

Richard pushed his pace on to catch up to me. “Don’t cut me out, Iain,” he said. “You know

deep down if the shoe was on the other foot you would make me do the same thing.”

I sighed. “Yeah, I know you’re right brother. I’m sorry. I just can’t stand the thought of Junior

out here. I need to see the boy home, whatever state he is in.”

“We all want that too mate,” Richard said putting his hand on my shoulder. “Something still

confuses me though, if everything else is dead, how did the dog escape here?”

I had wondered this myself but then I looked at everything surrounding us. “I can’t even

begin to wonder…”

“Alby was certainly glad to see us,” Richard commented, smiling. “But he was starving

hungry. On the one hand, if he’s ok, then they might be. But if they’d been together, there is

no way he wouldn’t have been fed…”

I knew Richard was just trying to reassure and distract me in his usual, kindly manner. For

the next hour, or so it seemed, he regaled me with reminiscences of Alby as a puppy,

Freddy, his childhood dog, Boots, the squadron mascot, and a dozen strays he had come

across in the course of carrying out his duty. He always had wanted to work with animals. I

wish we had spent longer reminiscing over the various canines close to his heart before the

peace was abruptly ended by a sight that chilled my blood.

We were near a small, natural clearing… where a quantity of fabric lay puddled on the

ground, almost concealed from sight in a dip in the rutted land. The now disturbed fabric of a

second tent was wrapped and secured firmly around what was the body of Daniel Booth. We

were back at my brother’s campsite. The food we had left still sat on top of the cooler.

“How in the hell are we back here?” Bryan asked, completely disorientated.

“I don’t have a clue,” I said, peering in a bewildered fashion at the map. “Not only have we

ended up back here, but despite walking west all afternoon we have arrived back here from

the opposite side to where we left.”

Allistair snatched the map. “Bullshit! You’ve just led us back here and you know it and don’t

want to admit it!”

“Alastair, calm down - this isn’t helping!”

“Don’t tell me to calm down!” he shrieked, spittle flying from his mouth, his eyes wide and

staring. “I’m beginning to think you guys are just deliberately fucking with me now! None of

this makes sense and as soon as I suggest we head back, suddenly, oh - we just magically

happen to arrive back in this camp? Well, I’m heading for base!” Alastair stormed back

towards the direction in which we left this place the first time.



“Come on, kid, it’s getting dark, don’t be reckless!” Richard yelled to him as he tried to catch

up to him.

“No! I am done! This whole place is fucked! I can’t stay here! I won’t stay here!”

“Come on, son, you know the risks of trying to hike this place at night,” I interjected.

“Oh, of course you want to stay here! It’s what you wanted all along!” Alastair snapped at

me. “What is it then? The three of you mislead me in to thinking you’ll listen then do the

opposite and act all surprised?”

“Er guys…” Byran stammered, but his comment went ignored.

“Soon as we get back, I’ll make sure I never see any of you here again!” Alastair was yelling,

squaring up to me.

“Guys…”

“Calm down, lad, before I put you in line,” I threatened.

“Guys!” Bryan yelled.

“What, Bryan??”

“I feel… Something just grabbed my hand…”

The three of us turned around to where Byran was standing. He was drip white and

panicking, his rifle raised, but aimed in no particular direction.

“Okay Bryan, just put your gun down. What do you mean?”

Byran didn’t move his hands gripping his weapon tightly. “Something just grabbed hold of my

hand!” Abruptly, the gun seemed to fall – almost to be flung – from his hands. Bryan was

turning around, looking for something he could not see, then staring wild-eyed at us. “God -

can’t you hear the whispering!?”

We all looked around but could see and hear nothing. The dead forest offered no answers

as to what plagued Bryan. I held my hands out and stepped cautiously towards him.

“Byran, talk to me: what’s up?” I pleaded.

“Oh, for God’s sake, he’s just wasting time, so we have to stay here!” Alastair snapped.

Bryan stormed towards Alastair, pointing directly at him.

“It was right there! You have to have seen it; it was right where you are now!” He

gesticulated wildly towards a space to the right of Alastair, his outstretched hand pointing.

Bryan stopped dead in his tracks as he stared at his hand: a blackish mark was spreading

on the top of it, staining his skin…

“Oh…”

Then, Bryan’s entire body seemed to fold over on itself. He started to convulse. His face was

contorted in agony. He grabbed his stomach and turned toward me.

\&quot;Iain... I...\&quot;



Suddenly, Bryan whipped backwards, violently, arched over impossibly until we heard

vertebrae grind together and dislocate. His eyes appeared milky, as though with cataracts,

then it was as if they shriveled in their sockets.

As he desperately flailed around, blind and in agony, Richard and I could do nothing but

watch the ungodly sight of our brother’s final moments...

Bryan was shrieking in agony, as his teeth were forced from his withered gums, seemingly

turning to dust before they even hit the ground. Bryan – the wretched remains of Bryan -

clutched at Alastair. An unearthly, animal wail of fear and agony seared his torn, dehydrated

throat.

Alastair echoed his scream, as his mind locked into a catatonic state.

In front of the terrified youth, Bryan’s skin turned grey and leathery. It stretched across his

bones, splitting and vaporizing. His skeletal hands still clutched Alastair’s coat, and he fell

backwards, Bryan’s corpse landing on top of him. Bryan continued to contort, and with a

sudden, horrific rupturing noise, Bryan’s stomach burst open causing his shrivelled organs to

cover Alastair in a tsunami of dust.

The suffering finally ended, the dissonant sounds of the events echoing through the decayed

My first pour over was with what I believe are Costa Rica Tarrazú Hot Springs beans (which I randomly found in a coffee stall in Osaka’s Kuromon Market - so this is an educated guess based on researching Costa Rican hot spring processed beans - no roasting date). 

I’m now using some of GoDark’s Colombian Buenavista Caturra, Huila (roasted a month ago)

(Note - I tried a 4:6 pour but it was just too complicated for me as I try to get a steady flow rate and juggle timing, etc.)

I’m using a 1zpresso K Ultra grinder and using a 6 (their grind chart seems to say to use an 8 for pour over but when I looked around I saw people recommending a 6…so maybe this is worth testing)

My 4:6 was drinkable but was too… idk, not bitter but maybe too astringent. 

Right now I am getting a nice smooth cup using the recipe below but it still feels like a get a lot of dry ‘pucker’ after a sip. 

Not sure what I should be changing to dial it in better - grind? Water temp? Etc?

Thanks for your thoughts - I appreciate any guidance and hope I’ve given enough information. 

Here’s the recipe:
20 g / 320 ml (1:16)
93 degrees C

❶  0.00 First pour: 50% total water volume (Open switch)
❷  0.45 Second pour 50% total water volume  (Closed switch)

I bought my home a bit more than three years ago. The HOA got my email address. I don't know how they got it. 

A few other owners wanted to meet and give me a bottle of wine. While I understand millions and millions of people drink wine regularly,  I have never been a wine drinker and just found this to be really weird. I told them I don't drink wine and would be happy with a 12 pack of coke. They said coffee would be fine instead, but as I was working 60 hour weeks -- where the coffee I have each day is (still) from my nespresso as I am running out the door, I passed. They went silent from there. I never received the coke. 



I got to know my nextdoor neighbor -- he is very personable and his husband is also very real. We still talk often. I respect him because he's also protected our building. This neighbor has been the Board President for the last couple of years. I got to know another person on a different floor. We checked out each others homes and he told me about the wine-welcoming he received. He was a wine drinker so it worked out for him. He was also personable and had renovated several condos. He actually switched out my sconces before he sold his unit and moved to the next project. He had great social skills. I also got to know another same-level neighbor who had a vape shop out of his unit. Since he worked with the public he was personable, too. 

I went years without being too generally interested in the building or its residents. 

The HOA wasn't having our trash room cleaned very often, so I started bringing buckets of hot soapy water and splashing it in and around. It had a drain so eventually the cleaning process was more of a maintaining the clean process. We also had a resident with a very angry guest who threw soda all over the front entry and windows. Not a big deal, but we have to pay to have that cleaned. To aid the process I found the owners email address and they paid to have it cleaned. 

  
In the last six months or so our trash room had been broken into (for the cans) and a few times we found people sleeping in the stairwell. By we I mean me and the HOA president. A few times this year random people would smoke in the stairwell and set off the fire alarm, usually from 2-4am. I had a few people on my gated, locked stoop doing various things from using the 'restroom' to looking at porn, so I had really dialed in my specific 'FAFO' tone. I called the police a couple times, then I started strong-arming anyone who wasn't supposed to be here. We haven't had a trespasser in a few months.

After reporting about a dozen people to the board president via text I think he got tired of hearing from me, so he referred me to the owners group chat. I was relieved because I thought it would be an active neighborhood watch kind of vibe. Unfortunately I set expectations a bit high. 

Basically, someone would say ""hey there's someone doing drugs in front of the building"" and someone would reply ""do you want me to call the police?"". It was unbearably passive. We shifted to talking about how the HOA and property management services aren't really doing their job. We started talking about installing cameras on each floor but dozens of texts never came to fruition.

Then one day as I was leaving the building I saw someone camping against our stairwell exit door and told them directly to leave. I let the chat know as sort of a warning to avoid that door for a while. Someone asked if I wanted them to call the police. I said sure, but really I was humoring them. They replied that their work meeting had just started and they could no longer do this. 

About a week later as I was leaving the building I saw a doordash driver trying to deliver to the back entrance. I got his attention and said ""Hey the front door is around the corner."" But he didn't understand me, so I pointed at the bag and said ""Name?"". I recognized the name and I walked him over to the front door and fobbed him in. I saw the person waiting inside the lobby, where she could see that I was letting this person in. She looked right at the doordash guy and said nothing to me. 

  
The only person who has thanked me for my efforts overall was the board president, which is why I don't care what the building thinks. I think *that* was the point where I decided that my building sucked. 

I was looking at instagram and saw a friend of mine who is a pottery teacher. I got inspired, took a picture of the bike room, and wanted to see if chatgpt could make something happen. I was so impressed with the photo it generated that I said fuck it and sent it on. Suddenly my passive group chat became vigilant, and instead of focusing on ways to improve our actual building safety they were coming after me -- merely because I was accessible. 

The guy who replaced my sconces, despite having moved two years ago, was still in the group chat and thought it was hilarious because he understood how impossible it would be to install a kiln. That was satisfying enough for me. 

I suggested the movie/google drive thing because most people own the movies they enjoy. When you own a physical or digital copy its not illegal to hold it for private viewing for free. It's not something that put anyone at risk.

So, while my previous posts got more than a thousand upvotes each and plenty of really bitter people decided they would vicariously live through my building and tell me about how 'unhinged' I am, in reality I am in many ways harmless. I work with the public full time.I know what reasonable is, I know how to fairly assess what unreasonable is, and I know what irrational is. 

  
I know my building almost entirely sucks aside from my nextdoor neighbor. Everyone else I have encountered has been socially inept. They don't have a right to double down on being inept. They don't have a right to pretend to be something they're not if I am here being real. They could have at any point just blocked my number from their group chat. 

  
Let the slam fest commence.

The silk slipped,

Not the curve of her hips
or the way she brewed coffee
like it was part of some sacred ritual
bitter, dark,
served in silence and sin.

Saturday doesn’t ask questions.
It lingers.
Like the taste of last night
still humming against her skin.
She’s not the kind of woman you pick,
she’s the one you prepare for.

Some men will never know
what it means
to be handled with both hands
like scripture,

or something far too holy
to touch without trembling.

And if she hums,
barefoot on tile,
a tune only the brave ones recognize
know this

She’s not waiting.
She’s remembering.

And red

1m3w7k7,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m3w7k7/making_an_open_source_lever_espresso_machine/,Making an open source Lever Espresso Machine,"So, I sometimes do coffee pop ups, where it's difficult to carry an espresso machine due to technical limitations. So I was looking for some options for manual lever espresso machine, like Flair. Most of them are pretty good, but I feel there is lack of standardisation in the options available.

For a simple non-electric mechanical machine, the prices are very inflated, I guess because getting a lever espresso machine is generally passion driven purchase. I mean on one hand, we have stuff like Aeropress, which is simple, highly customisable, gives great level of control, and is so affordable. And then we have all these lever espresso machines, priced unreasonably high for a piston, lever and a group head, and almost all the options would lack customisability. If you want more features, you buy their premium models. So I am designing my own Lever espresso machine, in Fusion 360. The goal is to have the following features -

1. **Piston Mounts** \- The piston, that pushes the water out at 6-9 bar of pressure, be either customisable (or replaceable). For example, one of the mounts can, with the use of hydraulics, multiply the pressure by 2. So if you use that mount, you will have the press longer, but for the same force applied, you might have twice the output pressure. Some other mount might have a spring attached, which softens the pressure applied, giving smooth or delayed pressure output. This way, with the use of different piston mounts, people can customise the pressure output.
2. **Choice of pressure guage** \- I would personally be building a small digital module that connects to my phone and let me visualise the pressure profile (pressure applied over time during a single press), so that I can practice different styles, but someone else might want to have a simple traditional pressure guage connected to their press. The idea is to have a place/hole where pressure guage can be mounted, and the community can choose what device they want to use. Options are limitless.
3. **Should be compatible with standard 58mm portafilter** \- I know there is no standard when it comes to portafilter, and we can't account for all types of portafilters, but I don't want to have some crazy design here that limits the type of portafilter to those of very specific styles.
4. **Lever position lock** \- Not that important for customisation, but it is a feature I want to have. Having an easy way to lock and unlock the lever angle.
5. **It should be simple yet beautiful** \- I always appreciate the simplicity of a french press, pour overs or an Aeropress. Some lever espresso machines too are simple, but some like Flair lose their charm with their (I don't know how to put it otherwise) - lack of simplicity in their design. Also, I want to clarify, by this, I don't mean that I want this design to be lacking in functionality. If a complicated gear system does a really good job in giving a really really good UX, it should be a part of the design, but it should not lock people out of options/customisability where it might be important.

The thing is - I ABSOLUTELY SUCK at Fusion 360. Because I have never used it in my life. And I am an electronics engg grad, but am absolutely clueless when it comes to the jargons used in mechanical engg. So sometimes, I am stuck because I don't know how to search for the kind of solution I want to implement.

So, this is where I need the community to step in. I would love if you all, coffee nerds (and possibly design geniuses) can help me here, making the dream lever espresso machine, so that anyone can use the design, or take inspiration from it, and manufacture it locally.

James didn’t need any fancy pitch decks. Or complicated 50-page proposals. Or do any begging or convincing.

Just our simple system in action.

The best part? James admits he's still going through the training and learning the setup.

But that didn't stop him from taking action and getting results FAST.

His exact words: ""Mind opened to new level of possibilities because of the training. I feel stupid now for not doing this type of marketing before.""

(Nothing better than seeing that lightbulb moment)

Now he's working on setting up the SMS systems and database reactivation for his attorney client.

This is exactly why we designed ROYA to be so straightforward:

* ONE client
* ONE super simple “heck yes” offer
* ONE person running it

No complexity.

No confusion.

Further, my stepdad clogged one of our toilets and left it for us to clean up and has not apologized at all, he sneaks off to get a coffee daily and doesn’t even offer to get anyone else anything, my stepdad and their dogs stink up the house, they never thank us for anything, etc. And finally, when I made mention that it felt like my mom pulled a fast one bringing the dogs without asking me, she started crying saying how could I say something so evil about her, and it literally ended up with ME being the one to apologize.

Ate it with a over easy egg, a toasted herb and garlic English muffin with butter, and a great cup of Nicaraguan coffee. Honestly one of the better starts to a day I’ve had in a while. The sear/ crust on this steak was a 9.5/10 imo. Hope everyone has a great Saturday 🥩 🍳.

I've been using my drip coffee maker daily for over a year now, and it's starting to taste... off. I know I should be cleaning it more regularly, but I'm finally ready to invest in a *good* coffee maker cleaner that actually works and doesn't leave any weird aftertaste.

I checked a bunch of articles ranking the best coffee maker cleaners on Google, and I saw brands like **Urnex**, **Affresh**, and **Full Circle** popping up a lot. Urnex Dezcal especially seems to have great reviews, but I'm wondering if it's really worth the hype or if there are better, lesser-known options out there.

Would love to hear what you guys use to clean your coffee machines—whether it's a drip machine, Keurig, espresso machine, or even a French press. Do you go with tablets, powders, or natural stuff like vinegar and baking soda? What’s worked best *without* messing with the taste?

I had just gotten some really bad news, nothing dramatic like in the movies, but heavy enough to make my chest feel tight.

I didn’t want to cry in public, so I was doing that thing where you pretend to be checking your phone but you're really just trying not to break down.

This older woman walking by slowed down, looked at me for half a second, and said, *“Whatever it is, you’re stronger than you feel right now.”*

That’s it. Just that. Then she kept walking.

It sounds small, I know. But for some reason, it hit me hard. I don’t think she could tell what was going on. Maybe she just *knew that look.*

It stuck with me. Still does.

It reminded me that people notice. Even when we think we’re invisible, someone sees us. And sometimes they say just enough to help you hang on.

1m3vyh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m3vyh4/my_m23_crush_f20_lied_to_me_and_it_deeply_changed/,"My (M23) crush (F20) lied to me, and it deeply changed how I see her. Still trying to understand what happened and process everything.","Earlier this year, I got close to a girl in my college class. Let’s call her Anna. She’s 20, I’m 23. Over time, we started spending a lot of time together — casual hangouts, long conversations, coffee breaks after lectures. We shared jokes, personal stories, and quiet emotional moments that, to me, started to feel like something more than just friendship. She even once said we had a “strange relationship,” and I agreed — it was never clearly defined, but it felt special, like we were orbiting something unspoken.

We were emotionally close, but I never pushed too hard. I tried to stay respectful, patient, waiting for her to maybe open up more when she was ready. She always replied to my messages, though she rarely initiated them. I could sense she was emotionally reserved, but I liked her and felt it was worth navigating with care.

Then something small happened that shifted everything. I heard from someone else that she had gone out for coffee with another guy in our class — let’s call him John. I casually asked her about it at the time, and she said no, she hadn’t met with him. I left it at that. But later, her friend Emily mentioned in passing that Anna had, in fact, gone for coffee with him.

It wasn’t the coffee that bothered me. It was the fact she’d lied. She didn’t owe me anything, and I wasn’t trying to control who she spent time with. But her choice to lie—when she could have just told the truth—made me feel like I didn’t know who she really was. It broke the emotional trust I’d been building slowly with her.

Eventually, I confronted her about it — not aggressively, but honestly. I told her I felt confused and hurt. I also told her that I saw patterns of emotional distance and manipulation. She didn’t deny it. In fact, during one conversation, she calmly said she was “just playing a little” with me. That line stuck with me.

After that, things fell apart quickly. She said I insulted her. I apologized more than once. I tried to explain where I was coming from — not to blame her, but to show I wasn’t just randomly upset. I even told her I’d learned from it, that I recognized my own impulsive tendencies and would never want to hurt her again. I offered to start over, to rebuild the trust from scratch.

But she declined. Instead, she offered what I can only call a “downgraded friendship” — where we’d say hi and be civil, but not hang out or talk like before. I told her I couldn’t accept that. It felt hollow, like pretending none of it meant anything. I told her it would hurt more to see her in passing, knowing we had something deeper and let it vanish. I walked away.

Two weeks have passed. She hasn’t blocked me. I haven’t reached out. Part of me wonders if she’s conflicted. Maybe she regrets it. Maybe not. I don’t know. I try not to obsess, but it's hard.

The strange part is that I still feel her emotional presence lingering in my head. Sometimes I wonder if she’ll reach out once the semester starts again — or if she'll just ignore me. I even wonder if she told some of our mutual classmates her version of the story.

The hardest part is the dissonance. This person who shared so many warm, soft moments with me is the same one who lied, played cold, and shut the door. It makes me question everything — was it ever real? Did she care? Or was I just someone to pass the time with?

I’m not writing this to paint her as a villain. I know I wasn’t perfect either. I reacted emotionally, and maybe too strongly. But I was honest about how I felt. I didn’t hide behind sarcasm or silence. I was vulnerable, and maybe that’s why it hurts this much.

Have any of you been in a similar situation — where something emotionally intimate unraveled not with a dramatic breakup, but with silence, confusion, and small lies? How do you let go of something that never had a name but meant something anyway?",1,1752930857.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

Porcelain offers a sleek, elegant look, but might be more delicate.The best mugs use lead-free and cadmium-free materials to ensure safe usage, and these certifications are usually indicated on the product details.

**Print Durability**

Some mugs feature prints that are baked onto the ceramic surface at high temperatures, which ensures the design won't peel, crack, or fade easily. Checking customer reviews regarding long-term print durability can provide useful insights.it’s best to steer clear of mugs with poorly applied decals or obvious signs of low-quality printing.

**Handle Design**

The handle design is an vital consideration for comfort and ease of use. Mugs with ergonomic handles offer a comfortable grip, preventing hand fatigue, especially with larger mugs. Look for handles that are large enough to accommodate multiple fingers or that have a contoured shape. Additionally,the handle should be securely attached to the mug itself,without any signs of wobbling or weakness.A well-designed handle considerably enhances the overall drinking experience.

**Microwave and Dishwasher Safety**

Ensuring that your swear bear mug is both microwave and dishwasher safe adds convenience to your daily routine. Confirm that the manufacturer explicitly states that the mug is safe for microwave use,as some materials may become excessively hot or damaged. Dishwasher safety is equally importent, especially considering the print durability. Mugs marked as dishwasher safe should be able to withstand repeated washing cycles without any degradation of the printed design or structural integrity of the mug.

background information,

* my father and mother started dating when my mum 15 and had my eldest sister at 17, whilst he was 24!
* i have 3 full sisters, one step brother (y), one half sister (I) and a half brother.
* father worked\\s as a bus driver
* through out my childhood my mother had jobs at asda and in a care home etc.
* current ages- me 15, mother 34, father 40 something, step mother (a) 30 (i think), step father 28 (T) (i think), older sis 17, younger sis 9, step brother 9, half sis about 9 months, half brother is 2  months 
* my father is an alcoholic
* i am a big people pleaser

when i was very little i used to live with my mum and dad but my dad was always at work or out playing darts\\gambling and cheating on my mum (which he denies relentlessly but he was caught lots of times ) so i didn't see him much so my mother raised me and me 3 sisters.

we had to move about 2.5 hours away for his job which is when he and my mother decided to split just after there 10th wedding anniversary (i was 8), where me and my 3 sis move in with mum and grandma because we couldn't afford a place for ourselves, while my dad kept the house we were renting at the time.

my mother was working at a bar and met my step dad, we will call him T, and they became friends while my father was depressed at home alone just going to work and drinking lots until the landlord kicked him out and he moved to a new house. eventually my mum, me and my 3 sis found a house close to my grans so we moved in and as we moved in, so did T(they never realy started dating they just became a couple as he moved in).  at this point my mother and father were friends and we sometimes did things as a ""family"".

COVID hit us hard as we didn't see our dad much and it affected our school so we were of for quite awhile, where we would go to my grans everyday to do school work cos she was free childcare while my parents were at work.

in COVID my dad met my step mum on a dating app, we will call her A, soon after we met her and her son Y, (my step brother), they seemed sweet so we were all happy.

(we visited my dad every second weekend for the weekend cos in his house we had a bedroom to sleep in. )

when A moved in with my dad, she changed, dad and her started to talk shit about my mum to me (which i believed because i was young and stupid). Y also changed into a mummy's boy\\brat who loved to bully me and beat me up because he knew i wouldn't tell A or dad.

she also changed my dad in my eyes as my mum never talked bad about him and he always managed to hide being a dick, but now that she showed up he started to smoke, become more of an alcoholic because she is also an alcoholic, and they just both became dismissive of my wants, needs and opinions because they knew i wouldn't speak up about anything.

after a long time of bad mouthing my mum they started to bring up the idea of me and my older sister  living with them, (we now realise they just needed the child support money). my sister realised he was a shitty father after he stopped sticking up for us but unfortunately i didn't so i moved in with them which deeply hurt my mum. 

when i moved in with them they treated me like i was fucking Cinderella and i hated it, i was cooking, cleaning, and taking care of my siblings. (while walking 2.5 miles to school every day, just to come home to a list of chores) but i never complained because i thought that it would be rude and i would be lazy and unappreciative which were all things i herd from my dad anyway. they were also constantly convincing me that they were so much better then my mum and T and they even talked shit about my sisters. my older sister stopped visiting my dad so i never got to see her and they removed her from all the pictures on the walls and never talked about her, it was like she never existed. (he blocked my mums side of the family from my phone so i had no contact with anyone)

there was always fights with my mum and T over the phone, so often at like half 10 at night i would be called downstairs to sit outside with them as they smoked and argued with my mum over the phone, (i was often in shorts and it was winter) but my mum never knew i was there so she was shouting and going crazy. 

when i lived with A and dad ever weekend my sister came to visit (which was becoming less often) they would act so different, they would have game nights, be nice, cook nice diners, we went on days out, watched family movies, things like that. 

they could constantly tell me i was ungrateful and that i didn't work hard enough at school and that i didn't participate enough in ""investing in the family"" but when i wasn't sleeping i was cleaning or taking care of Y or cooking for them because the were to hung over to cook for them selves. (they were too hung over to do anything so i went to the shops and stuff for them often). 

when my mum found out just how awful they were treating me she threatened to call CPS on them so they gave me back to my mum. (she finally realised when he refused to let me see my granddad who was about to die from cancer)

after i moved back in with my mum any love my dad had left for me left. i was just a cleaner and babysitter and house maintenance help. me and my sisters were dismissed and forgotten, but one thing that never stopped  was the bulling from Y, and it got worse.

i remember one time Y taped my little sister in a room and said ""i don't want you here, leave. leave. leave. leave. go home and cry to your mean mummy"" and that broke me because i told dad and guess what he did? nothing. these incidents kept happening so one day on the car ride home from his house me and my sister broke down crying, and that was when i decided that i was done with him and his abuse. that was the last time i saw him. after that i went home and wrote a letter explaining all about Y and A and how they were bad parents. when he got the letter he texted me about how he is very angry and sad that i would do this to him and that he always cared very deeply for me. i didn't answer him, he wasnt worth any more of my time.

now i wonder if i was too harsh. I want to see him again because he was my father and i miss him but i don't know if he has changed or if he would even see me. do i meet him for coffee and discuss it all?  I don't know what to do. it would be nice to meet my half sister once i guess. 

(i forgot to mention my dad also doesn't and never has pay child support, he financially abused my mum and convinced me that my mum, T, and my sisters hated me when i lived with them)",1,1752930685.0,u_Miserable_Pay_2418,0,1.0,False
1m3vvyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1m3vvyx/why_choose_brensten_replacement_charcoal_water/,Why Choose Brensten Replacement Charcoal Water Filters for Keurig Coffee Makers Review?,"**Compact and Functional Design**  
The Brensten B09Z64RMT7 water filter pack immediately caught my attention with its practical and compact design. Considering I frequently brew coffee on my Keurig machine, a compact filter that fits snugly in the reservoir is almost a necessity. These replaceable charcoal filters arrive in a neat pack of six, and despite their small size, they boast an impressive build quality. The basket-like shape perfectly matches the Keurig filter compartment, making them easy to install and secure without any awkward adjustments. Over the past couple of weeks, I've had no issues with water leaking or poor fit, which speaks to the thoughtful design of these filters.  

**Improved Coffee Flavor and Aroma**  
I've noticed a remarkable improvement in the flavor of my coffee since switching to these charcoal filters. Their ability to remove chlorine, calcium, odors, and other impurities from water is noteworthy. As promised, the fresh, robust flavors of my morning brew now shine through without any distracting bitterness or off-tastes. I drink coffee daily, and the difference these filters made to the aroma and smoothness was undeniable from day one. While I appreciated the richness of my coffee, my coworkers, who often share a cup, were equally impressed. It’s safe to say these filters amplify coffee enthusiasts' overall experience.  

[Grab BRENSTEN B09Z64RMT7 at the best price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b09z64rmt7/)  

**Ease of Installation**  
Not everyone wants to mess around with complicated installations, and these filters pleasantly delivered on their promise of simplicity. I followed the straightforward directions—soaked the filter for a few minutes, rinsed it, and placed it in its slot. Nothing too technical, and I was happy to skip using any special equipment. I'm not the most DIY-savvy, but this process only took me five minutes tops. In my opinion, the ease of installation would be ideal for anyone, including those who are new to single-cup Keurig machines.  

**Positives**  
- Provides improved coffee water quality by filtering chlorine and impurities.  
- Compatible with Keurig 1.0 and 2.0 coffee makers, making it versatile.  
- Affordable solution compared to factory-brand filters.  

**Possible Negatives**  
- Each filter lasts only 60 days or 60 tank refills, so frequent coffee drinkers may need replacement packs sooner.  
- Not a universal fit—it's exclusive to specific Keurig models and cannot be used in Cuisinart coffee makers.  

**Competing Brands**  
Several other filter brands on the market could compete with these charcoal filters. For instance, the Cuisinart filter packs are popular for users loyal to that brand, often boasting the same chlorine-removal benefits. However, they aren’t compatible with Keurig machines, giving these Brensten filters a clear edge for Keurig owners. There are also some unbranded or generic charcoal filters on the market that might cost slightly less, but they often fall short in construction quality or ease of use. These filters, on the other hand, meet their promise of being both cost-efficient and reliable.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
While it's tempting to opt for cheaper knockoff filters, the price-to-quality ratio of these filters is excellent. You're receiving a six-pack of charcoal-filter cartridges that deliver clean water for coffee brewing without breaking the bank. Considering how much you’d typically spend at coffee shops for equivalent taste, these filters undeniably save money in the long run. Of course, individual preferences might differ, but I found their affordability absolutely worth my investment.

1m3vvhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1m3vvhh/should_i_let_my_boss_know/,Should I let my boss know?,"My (55M) wife (55F) has early onset dementia (logopenic PPA caused by Alzheimer’s pathology). She was diagnosed 2 years ago, but I put the beginning of symptoms about 4-5 years ago. I care for her, her parents are 4 hours away, a brother is 1 hour away, our daughter is 4 hours away, my family is further than that.

We have in home care a few hours a day, 2x a week, and she goes to adult day care (all day) 2x a week. I try and swing by the house mid morning (as I go between work locations) on the days she’s not at day care to make sure she has coffee and breakfast. She can manage hygiene ok, but resists showering. She can get cold food, but can’t cook and lately has trouble managing the microwave. Sometimes I run home at lunch to be sure she eats. She cannot deal with the TV remote, so I leave it on tuned to the mystery channel she likes. Language has been her biggest issue, but memory is starting to go also.

My question is when/if I let my boss know what is going on. I lead the finance/acct. function at my small to mid-size company, reporting to the CEO. I worry it seems like I am just working standard hours, which in my roll feels light, so it might be good if he knew. On the other hand, I don’t want him to worry about my longevity in the job and start thinking about replacing me.

My wife would like me home all the time, but I can’t quite retire at 55, so I don’t want to be forced out early.

Thoughts?

1m3vuus,https://youtu.be/jxmVf6HF7Jo?si=SR-MAnFrwXGoByZ7,"So You Want to Move to Pahrump, Nevada? Watch This First!","So we use the Boutique to talk about how lackluster the grifters are, and rightfully so. But I want to share a tidbit about a creator who doesn't take the lazy way out as her popularity grows: Wonderhussy. 

She does the occasional ""viewer mail"" segment or livestream, and she will do her version of the walk/talk, but she does them when she has something to say rather than using them as hollow filler for easy cash, spewing hollow proclamations about the future five times over.

But most of her content, which she doesn't try to cram down your throat 7 days a week, is about her exploring and adventures. Unlike David the Poo, Wonderhussy actually explores places she goes to rather than wanders around aimlessly, talking about the coffee she purchased. She has spent years poking around abandoned buildings, mostly in the desert. From modest old shacks and cabins in the middle of nowhere to abandoned mobile homes, from mining sites of yesteryear with abandoned machinery and vehicles to abandoned buildings used for casino gambling, brothels or illegal marijuana farming, Wonderhussy goes on adventures David couldn't handle. Maybe he might have been able to accomplish the same things 15 years ago, but definitely not today. 

Wonderhussy is a colorful character with a colorful history, and could have had a corporate career, but decided to hustle for a living and live on her own terms. She still lives simply, despite her Youtube income and many donations she receives from viewers. She has shown some of the many packages and gifts she has received in a video or two, and she gets nice stuff, and a lot of it is to help her on her desert journeys, as she often camps in the middle of nowhere during some of her remote explorations. But she never asks for likes, subscribers or donations, and rarely pimps her merch.

She does sell merch, but hardly. Her biggest thing she sells is a calendar. She use to do modeling of all sorts, anything to pay the bills, including nude modeling for professional photographers. She has costumes that she used for some of her quirky gigs of the past, and she pulls them out and uses them occasionally, including for photos for her annual calendar. 

She has been a big fan of Burning Man for years, attending the festival annually. Not sure if she still does, as it has become overrun due to commercialization. But she'd often film videos during her days camping at Burning Man, pulling out some of her wacky costumes.

She lives in Death Valley with her sister, so some of her videos are more hum drum stories of life in a cluster of homes in the middle of the desert. She lived in a modest Vegas home for years, worked gigs in Vegas before Youtube became lucrative enough for her to live off of, yet remains rather humble and invests in things that matter, like her 4-wheel drive vehicle, which is critical to maintain for some of her off-the-grid excursions. She travels, but not often by air. She does occasionally visit other places outside of Nevada. Recently she went to Australia, and has some videos from that. But that's a rare trip for her. (I haven't watched any of  those videos, so I don't know the details on why she wound up there.)

She occasionally shows things in Vegas, and tells stories about her many years living and working in Vegas. But she's not competing with the ""influencers"" who want us to know what a great value the El Cortez cabana suites are or what a great value the South Point Casino buffet is. Her stories from Vegas are tales of a person who has lived there, and lived an unordinary life. As I said, she has a colorful history. 

She visits all sorts of towns across Nevada. This recent video from Pahrump I shared shows what life is like in a Nevada outpost. There are more than 45,000 people living there, yet it's an unincorporated town. It was featured in an HBO show called ""Small Town News: KPVM Pahrump."" There's a locally based TV station that covers the community, as well as news out of Vegas, and the station was the focal point of the 2021 HBO series. Pahrump is a quirky, weird place known as the closest destination from Vegas for legal prostitution. (Prostitution is legal in Nevada, but not in the Vegas area, ironically. I forget the reason why that is.) 

Wonderhussy has yet to reach 300K subs, yet her videos almost always crack 50K, and she does better than 60K on plenty of them. It helps that she does interesting stuff and isn't churning out garbage 7 days/week. 

She may not be your cup of tea. Abandoned sites in the desert may not appeal to you. But given I have loved abandoned exploration, which was the reason I gravitated to David and the Carpetsnake a decade or so ago, Wonderhussy helps fill the void now that David and Jake are dull and uninspired.

1m3vupm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1m3vupm/joes_bar_grill_the_most_heavily_defended_place_in/,Joe's Bar & Grill - The Most Heavily Defended Place In The Galaxy,"Our small tug seemed even smaller than usual as we wove our way through the heavy traffic in the system, wary of the thousands of guns and ships keeping an absurdly close watch on us. The star system bustled with more activity than even a major trade hub. But for some reason there were very few, if any actual cargo ships or trade vessels. Most ships were heavily armed mercenary vessels, warships and mobile battlegroups. We were paid extra cash for this, no questions asked job, and I already regretted it. The job was simply to deliver some starbase expansion modules, mostly hydroponics equipment.

So here we were. Jumped into the star system, and within seconds we had ten battleship class vessels aiming their guns at us demanding ident details. We collectively shat ourselves at the sight and hastily garbled the codes and details we were given. After they all got the idea we were redirected to a small starbase, marked by a large dome structure in its centre. It was called 'Joe's Bar & Grill'. What's a bar? What's a grill? We didn't know as we approached, and were allowed inside of the base shield to offload what we brought.

A menagerie of species and races were there, most of which were security personnel who regarded both each other and us as a threat as they brandished various firearms and blades at us. Apes, slugs, fungi, even robots and stranger creatures than us, all seemed to work together in some kind of uneasy alliance, simply to protect this place. We all wondered why as what we assumed to be a dockmaster of some kind appeared and squelched up to me. Our translation matrices made short work of our conversation.

""Good day. You are Captain Waggafasticus of the courier company I asked for?"" He asked, with a strange smile.

""Uhh… Yeah. Just call me Wagg. Everyone does."" I replied, extending one of my claws in greeting. ""Forerunner Couriers at your service. You needed Greenhouse equipment apparently?""

""Indeed we did!"" He said and gleefully shook my hand in standard greeting. ""We have been looking forward to this for weeks! Come, quick now, must not wait. Its nearly lunch time!"" He gleefully yelled. He then turned to the crowd of assembled soldiers and security and yelled. ""HYDROPONICS ARE HERE BOYS! GET IT INSTALLED!""

The crowd yelled out in glee and hastily headed over to my tiny ship to recover the equipment we brought in. Grow lamps, centrifuge trays, several tons of fertile soil and other things necessary. Old tech, but apparently valuable to the right buyer. I helped offload the stuff and was handed a pay check three times what I was expecting from the job.

""Woah wait, hold on! This job was only for two thousand Dactarians! Why did you give me six thousand!?"" I asked.

""Because that's what we do here. Good service is always rewarded. No backstabbing, no counter offers, no nonsense. We always give a bit extra to those who don't argue and deliver fast. I look forward to working with you in future! Now, come on in, I'll treat you to a brew, now we got the equipment for it."" The dockmaster replied, almost physically dragging me inside the small building.

Upon entering, I was overcome by a host of smells, scents and feelings I never encountered before. The atmosphere was heavy with jubilation and relaxation. Tables of all sizes and shapes around a flat room with a long counter prominent against one wall, with smaller stools propped up against it. A variety of aliens, most of which were Council races and a few that I had never seen before, all arrayed before me in a setting that seemed more than just a bit out of place. I looked around and saw an empty seat at the bar. Unfortunately it was next to a Vakarian Warrior, large ape-like creatures with four arms and an attitude that matched his bulk.

I gave up trying to make sense of it all and just looked around me for now. Some Olivarkians were sitting around a table smoking a strange liquid substance out of some strange glass device. The smell from it was potent but not offensive. It seemed to make me feel calmer for some reason. At another table was the oddest sight in the universe - a Sakarian and a Boralis, not actively attempting to tear each other apart. I had to smack myself to see if I was dreaming but it was in fact real. Two sworn enemies that have been at each other's throats for millennia, calmly sitting at a table together NOT killing each other.

A strange smog, likely from the smoking of various substances, hopefully not lethal ones, hung close to the ceiling. A strange aura of calmness wafted around me as I turned, and sat face to face with the place's owner, presumably.

A human.

It certainly looked human at least. That's what the Archive said. Two eyes, arms with two hands, two legs, no natural weapons and a tuft of hair on its head and chin. I thought they were extinct... I couldn't really react before he spoke first.

""Well howdy! Welcome to Joe's Bar & Grill. You seem new! I'm Joseph, or simply Joe. What can I get for you?"" He said with a warm and friendly smile.

The Vakarian next to me grunted something angrily. ""Yeah, yeah Makalith cool your fur, your burgers on the grill. Other customers exist, you know. So, what can I get you?"" Joe replied to the grunt.

The Vakarian let out a sad whimper and impatiently tapped his right foot. I tried to ignore it. ""Uhh… Well... I don't really know. Do you have anything for a herbivore? I can't eat meat."" I replied.

""Veggie burger, burrito, pizza or perhaps just some greens in a bowl?"" He asked.

""He will take a burrito. I know his kind. Trust me he will take the burrito."" The Vakarian barked, glaring at me side-eyed.

""Now you look here Vakarian-"" I tried to say.

The entire bar stopped, stared at me and glared angrily at me. As if I had just broken some unwritten rule that was unforgiveable. The sudden menace made me stop mid-insult. I cowered under the weight of the crowd's gaze and just sank into my seat, nodding my approval at the menu choice and tried to stay quiet. The angry crowd, satisfied I had been successfully subdued, carried on their conversations and activities as they had never stopped. I tried to stay calm.

The human just shrugged his shoulders and vanished into the back. The Vakarian did nothing beyond glaring at me sideways and sipping liquid from a glass. A minute or so later, the human reappeared, holding a rather large, but shockingly tasty smelling item on a plate. I recognised it as a 'burger' item, from the menu arrayed in front of me. Presumably one made just for Vakarian tastes I assumed. Joe placed the plate down.

""Here ya go bud. One double cheese Vakker Bun with no pickle and a side of fries with a coke. Just the way you like it!"" The human said with enthusiasm and put a strange bubbling black liquid down too, along with some delightfully smelling pointy sticks of some kind in a small box.

I had smelled the scent of those strange sticks and couldn't stop staring at them, my mouth watering. Joe took it as his cue and spoke. ""Apparently I will be adding a side of fries with your burrito. Comin' right up!""

The Vakarian grabbed the strange flat cylindrical object and took a deep breath of its scent. Just as he was about to sink his teeth into it he noticed my expression and hunger. He sighed heavily and took some of the strange sticks. ""French fries. Have a taste."" He said, and gave me a few of them. I took them and sniffed them. Root vegetables of some kind, cooked in some way. I tasted it and melted. I went to heaven. Lightly salted, just enough you know it's there. Crispy and crunchy on the outside but so soft on the inside. A root vegetable cooked to absolute perfection in some way I couldn't fathom.

He picked up his burger and sank his teeth into it. The Vakarian barbarian I knew suddenly vanished and was replaced by a peacemaker. The aura of hatred and anger surrounding him vanished. He chewed on it slowly and emitted a groan of pure happiness. Before I could ask what was going on, Joe returned and placed a plate in front of me. I was immediately overcome by the smell of it. A different scale of vegetables and even fruit-like things broke my brain and made me unreasonably hungry. Alongside that, a glass receptacle of bubbling liquid, and a small bag of those stick things called 'fries'.

I barely recognized any of the items. The 'burrito' as it was, was an odd wrapped thing of pastry or bread of some kind, stuffed with various things I didn't know about but WANTED to eat. Every fiber of my being demanded I eat it. A mix of colours, green, red, yellow and what I correctly surmised to be a vegetarian meat supplement of sorts, all oozing some amazing smelling thick brown liquid. I picked it up and tried to figure out how to eat it. The Vakarian cleared his throat and mimed out how to take my first bite of it.

I swear upon the graves of all Ancient peoples that a part of my soul separated from me and went to Paradise in the afterlife the very second I sank my flat teeth into that burrito. The bread substance was indeed bread of some kind, and crunched softly. The insides were a mix of cold and hot, the odd red things, tangy and sweet, the yellow and green bits were mixes of a leafy thing and a few bits of an odd thing that had a bite of its own. The filling was indeed meat, but it wasn't. It looked like meat. It... It even tasted like meat. But there was something about it in my brain, an instinct that screamed 'SHUT UP ITS NOT MEAT NOW KEEP EATING'. Or something.

I emitted grunts, growls and moans of pure bliss as I ate the burrito. I don't think for a solid fifteen minutes I said a single word or correctly uttered a syllable. I was enjoying myself far too much. By now the rest of my crew had wandered in and sat down at their own tables. Joe had greeted them, and offered the same thing I was eating after they asked. The burrito was too much for me. By the time it was half done, I was full, but every iota of my existence was begging me to eat the whole thing. Each bite had a new journey, a new story to tell, a new song to sing. A new flavour to add.

The sauce had congealed at the bottom of it and I greedily lapped it up in hunger. I was not hungry anymore but I grabbed the box of 'fries' and scarfed them down like an absolute Gronkrat. I felt so full I swear I would explode. What was it about this cooking? I finally looked around me and noticed my fellows had received their meals and were crying with happiness at the event. They, too, couldn't stop eating either. The Vakarian was looking at me, slowly stirring a cup of some kind of hot black beverage. He had a smirk on his face. The knowing one, not the smug one.

""So... How did you like your burrito? Told you you'd like it."" He said and with more smugness than I knew existed, sipped his hot beverage.

I raised a hand in protest, but the words didn't come out. I was just too... Fat. Or... What is the verb or adjective to describe how you eat something so delicious it kills a part of your soul and makes you overeat yourself into a coma? I'm going to go with Fooded. Seems as reasonable a word as any.

The Vakarian just chuckled in response and carried on. ""I know. It was like that my first time eating at Joe's place. God what a time... Still get that tingle thanks to the burger sauce. It feels like home."" He said.

""What even is this place? I thought humans were all gone..."" I said, barely managing to garble a sentence out from my food drunk stupor.

""Joe's Bar and Grill. A human owns this place and serves human food here. With human ingredients from long lost earth. Joe is basically the only one who is left."" He replied.

""Oh."" I said and stayed quiet for a bit while my brain woke up again. ""Why?"" I asked eventually.

""Because I like cooking, growing ingredients and meeting people. So why not?"" Joe replied as he put a cup of some odd black substance in a smaller cup in front of me. ""Here ya go, Ceylon blend tea. Works better for you herbivores than coffee does.""

I gave the strange concoction a sniff and by the ancients did it smell nice! It was definitely tea, we were familiar with the concept of course but I had never smelled, or subsequently tasted something so rich and fulfilling. I stirred it and took a sip, and at that moment yet another part of my soul disintegrated and vanished to paradise. Why was the food here of such incredible quality? Why was, of all things, a HUMAN in charge of the place? What even was all this?

Before I could ask anything Joe suddenly yelled out. ""HEY LADS! hydroponics are replaced, looks like beers back on the menu!"" he yelled.

The calm of the assembled crowd suddenly shattered into a frenzy of divine praise and happiness. What was beer? Once again, I couldn't ask any questions as Joe gave me a glass bottle with a metal cap. ""Here ya go bud, on the house! Thanks for delivering that hydroponics equipment. Can finally start growing this season's Hops crop.""

""You are welcome-? But... what's this?"" I asked.

""Beer. Ice cold beer. Malt, hops, yeast and water, left to ferment for one year. Gives a basic taste, without too much alcohol. Gives a soft buzz and not enough of it to be dangerous to anyone in the galaxy. Its the perfect basic brew. Been keeping these ones on ice for a special occasion. And you're it! Enjoy!"" He said with a happy smile and used a tool to pop the metal cap off it.

Once again, the smell, the strangely bitter but refreshing taste... The strange feeling of accomplishment, cooling and comfort I got from it made a part of my soul vanish. I swear if I didn't know better I’d say I was already dead from that. The Vakarian smirked at me again.

""I know right? Amazing stuff. But hydroponics gardens packed up a few weeks ago so he's been keeping it off the counter for only VIP guests and regulars because he can't replace any too easily. So good to have this stuff around... It's almost like nourishment for the soul, not just the body."" He said, sipping his beverage.

""I don't think I have a soul left after that. I died and went to paradise too many times..."" I said with a light buzz in my head. ""so that explains why this star system is more heavily defended than most Capitals.."" I remarked.

""Yup. It's because of the treasure trove of rare tasty food, rare tasty drink, atmosphere of brotherhood and peace, and also because of the only human left alive."" He said.

""Suddenly this all makes a bit more sense."" I said.

He just chuckled. ""Too bad there aren't more humans around... I wish there were more of them."" He replied.

""What do you mean?"" Joe idly asked while polishing a container.

""Joe, are you aware you are the only human alive?"" I said plainly.

He stared at us, then burst into laughter. ""What!? No I'm not! Everyone else is back home in the Milky Way. Everyone just got tired of dealing with all of the Skatandi and their stupid warmongering so we just packed up and left. Our real home is in Sol, way back there."" He said, pointing to the starlight of a distant galaxy. ""I wonder if I should fire up the old teleporter beacon and invite some old buddies over for drinks... Yeah! I'll do that. Oh wait, I forgot about... I'll do that after I finish making that pie..."" Joe said, apparently now talking to himself as he retreated back into the kitchen.

This left the rest of us suddenly stunned into silence. Humans... weren't extinct? They just got tired of the backstabbing warmongers of the galaxy and walked away? And also they didn't come from this galaxy but their own? And he had a teleporter? They have THAT kind of technology!? Not only to cross the void between galaxies but also to do it instantly? The silence continued uncomfortably while we contemplated, imagined and nightmare dreamed all the possibilities of just how completely screwed we were.

What kinds of machinery did they have to cross the empty void? What weapons did they have to safely ignore the horrors between universes in the cold empty? What kind of creatures were they that they could hold their own? And Joe himself was over two hundred years old now considering how old this place was, judging from the sign stating the day of its founding. How long did humans live?

""PIES DONE!"" Joe bellowed from the kitchen. ""DESSERTS ON LADS!"" He yelled, the room suddenly filling with the sweet smell of fruity berries and baked sugars.

Joe seemed to have forgotten about the teleporter, and we kind of pretended to do the same as we all enjoyed a slice of Blueberry pie, on the house of course.

Today I actually woke up early…

I’d like to know what you and your S/O do in your day to day life!

For myself. I usually wake up a bit late so Jaga is awake first and already outside on a walk or working out. 

I like to think she’d make coffee every morning for me but not exactly “for” me. She would just “make coffee” in general but really it’s for both of us 🖤🐆

I have a bad habit of being on my phone a lot but lately I’ve been trying to draw and practice my instrument more instead so that I can feel more connected to Jaga. I don’t think she’d enjoy just sitting next to me while I’m on my phone for like an hour unless I’m showing her something!

I’ve also been trying to go to bed earlier as well. It’s nice to think she’s close to me while we sleep.

I have moved from clever dripper to v60 not long ago and have a problem with dialing anaerobic natural coffee from Vietnam. 

I use: Timemore c3, volvic water, Hario 01 paper filters. 

Method: 
„Ross droplet technique”
92 degrees Celsius water 
12,5g for 250g of water. ( ratio recommended by barista) 
45 second bloom - 30g of water
From 0:45 to 1:10 - 100g of water 
1:10 to 1:30 - 150g
1:30 to 1:50 - 200g
1:50 to 2:35 - 250g

Best cup I have managed to make was with 14 clicks on my grinder but it had a little bit of bitter aftertaste. I have tried 16 and 18 clicks but the coffee was even worse. 

Should I stay with this ratio 12,5g to 250ml or shorten the bloom time ? Maybe reduce steps and pour more water each step ?

1m3vqb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveDysfunction/comments/1m3vqb3/please_help_me_i_am_drowning/,"Please help me, I am drowning","Hello all,

I have ADHD + OCD confirmed so far and Major depressive disorder and high anxiety too.

I’m on meds for the depression, and anxiety - but only recently trying out stimulants for ADHD but they made me sleepy and I heard that can happen if you sleep schedule is messed up, so I’ve been trying to fix that and failing miserably.

I also take melatonin for sleep. My doctor prescribed me 3mg but 3mg made it impossible for me to wake up in the morning so I have half a pill now so 1.5mg. But I still find it difficult to wake up in the morning. 

First - clothes organisation. This is my biggest nightmare. I have limited cupboard space and even if I fix it up, it’s so difficult to maintain, so difficult to fold clothes every single day. I have a full time job and if I’m overwhelmed I’m neither able to do my job nor am I able to the household work. I kinda freeze.

Also when I dont know the ideal solution for something f and can’t think of one, I freeze up too and do nothing.

Then there’s my jewellery and lipstick. I’ve looked into makeup organizers but all of them are bulky or ugly or too big or too expensive and even then there’s no gurantee that I’ll be able to maintain it.

Eating - I’ve been trying to lose weight and I’ve been trying to avoid meals, which is obviously backfiring right now and my self confidence is in the gutter. 

 Also another factor that would provide some more context - some of these things have become more difficult off late because: I used to work a low paying job and lived pay check to pay check especially with my psych fees and psych meds and medical issues overall. 

Then I got a new job that would pay me double of what I was getting earlier. I left my old job mid month and joined the new job the same week. 

Since I live pay check to pay check I use credit cards often. I’ve never had a late payment, like ever. 

I was expecting a nice paycheck so I decided to splurge a little and raked up my credit card bills, it wasn’t unusually high tho - almost similar to my prev months. but a week before I left my old job I had a horrible realisation. Since I was joining the new job mid month and was at my old job for only two weeks - There is a possibility that I wouldn’t get a paycheck that month. Obviously my old job would pay me for my last two weeks and the new job would pay me for the first two weeks but not necessarily at the end of that month, when the credit card bills were due.

I spoke to my new job and they said ya you won’t get a paycheck this month. My old job - I was so anxious about leaving, because I don’t do well with change, it was my first job and some other emotional reasons, so I kept putting off the exit procedures until HR called me extremely pissed. She said if I didn’t do this asap my final settlement would be delayed, which is basically my salary for those two weeks and anything else I’m owed like encashed leaves, gratuity etc.

Everywhere online it said that this particular company takes 30-40 days for the final settlement.

I was panicking like crazy but trying to keep calm. My mom was willing to support me through this and so were my friends but I was mad at myself for my spending habits. 

Luckily my final settlement came really quick and before month end and it was enough to cover the bills. And then at month end I surprisingly got a paycheck from my new job as well so it was all good in the end.

But the thing is that now I’m scared to spend money. This may sound like a good thing but as a result I’ve cut out expensive essentials, and have been spending money on “cheap” stuff without realising that the purchases are all adding up to almost as much as the essentials would have cost me. I’m only just realising this and I feel so horrible.

Also my physical insecurity has made this worse because I was invited to my old school to speak about my career but I was so self conscious that I spent more time choosing an outfit than preparing a speech. And I spent a ton of money on it - and that only made me feel more shitty because none of the stuff really fit me. So I ended up worse than I began.

I have been taking metaformin, walking more, taking stairs instead of the lift, sometimes taking the longer route when I have time to walk through and quit sugar. This showed some time to show effect but eventually I lost 6 Kgs. This was maybe 1-2 weeks back. But I feel like I’ve slipped now - the occasional sugar in my coffee, the occasional sugary treat and I think I might be putting on again.

But the sugar cravings won’t go which I think may be because of all this stress plus the stress of a new job.

I also forget to take meds, forget to fill my water bottle - I’ve thought of a solution for this, keep my pills and water at hand at any time so that when I remember I can just take them.

Scheduling messages and trying to log easy remindersn my phone. But for those two issues I need serious help. I also need some sort of budget and tips l, pls help if anyone knows abg this, ",1,1752930193.0,ExecutiveDysfunction,1,1.0,False

It was just seventeen seconds long. He’d called around 6 PM, a few hours before the accident. I missed it because I was stuck in a pointless meeting. By the time I saw the missed call, the hospital had already reached out.

I didn’t listen to the voicemail right away. I couldn’t. I was afraid it would just be something normal, like “call me back,” and that would somehow make it worse. I wanted it to mean something.

Four days later, I finally played it.

“Hey bud,” he said. “Just thought of you. Drove past that gas station we always stopped at on our fishing trips. They still sell those stale honey buns you liked. Anyway... miss you, I guess.”

That was it. Seventeen seconds.

No goodbye. No “I love you.” But somehow, that small message broke me more than a goodbye ever could. Because that was him quiet affection, tucked into small memories and dry humor.

I listened to that voicemail all the time. When life felt heavy, I’d play it. His voice grounded me.

Then one day, after a phone update, it was gone.

I called my provider. Tried every recovery trick I could find. Nothing worked. I sat in my car and cried like I had just lost him again.

That night, I drove to the gas station he mentioned. It hadn’t changed. Still smelled like burnt coffee. Same guy behind the counter. And yes they still sold those stale honey buns.

I bought one. Sat on the hood of my car, unwrapped it under the parking lot lights, and ate it. And in that moment, I could hear him. Not like a ghost or anything just… in my head. His tone. The way he said “bud.” Every pause.

I realized I’d memorized it. I didn’t need the voicemail.

It wasn’t gone.

I have always worked either from home or very close to home, so mornings haven’t been rushed, and I’ve had the time to do pour overs.

That’s changing as I start a new job on Monday that will involve my longest commute by far, at least most days of the week. So I’ve decided it’s time to invest in a brewer, and I’m willing to spend a few extra to get one that meets our needs best.

Breville Precision/Luxe

1m3vfgo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m3vfgo,3Bomber Meteorite flat bottom brewer (review),"Pros :
- Excellent heat retention, better to brew one click coarser than usual on a Comandante to get a balanced result (compared to a B75 dripper).
- The hollow base allows you to easily see the coffee drip and adjust your pour accordingly. It also help to avoid condensation. 
- Good flow with large hole, it is faster than their Meteor dripper with 3 small holes. 
- Small size, I've added an anchor in the picture for reference, but you actually don't need it. The small size helps with precise pouring. I usually use 13.5g, 1:16 ratio and 4 pours. 
- It cannot break when falling down as the whole dripper is metal. 
- Elegant look with the leather cover. 

Cons : 
- the base is attached to the dripper with a thin metal thread, easily damaged and loud creaking noise when taking it off, Bomber answered that it's better to not unscrew the base. It would be nice to be a single body or having a way to clip it without threads for easy cleaning. 
- the dripper gets and remain extremely hot and the only way to hold it is with the leather cover coming with it. It does look nice but I wonder how long the cover and 2 buttons will last on the long term. I guess Bomber could sell spare leather covers if it becomes a problem. 

The taste is thick with sharpness and complexity, I find it very interesting after using an Origami for a year or so. Compared to the Timemore B75 I'd say the Meteorite is a better fit for light roast. But overall it's similar if you grind accordingly. 
 
Overall a nice and unique brewer, many great things that I've never seen before. It just need some extra care compared to other brewers (heat and leather cover).

Considering the Aussies are truly the ones who're holding the line in this, since the premise here is the Americans, due to incompetence and rising fascism, stay out of a future PRC invasion of Taiwan, leaving a coalition of Pacific democracies to have to step in and fight back alone. It's tentatively titled ""Roar of the Dragon"".

Some notes: I kept American spelling for words unless they're being spoken aloud by one of the Aussie characters (metre vs meter, etc). I was trying to figure out which way to go and figured that was the best one.

**Chapter 2: Systems Integration**

*January 15, 2027*

*HMAS* Melbourne*, off the coast of Western Australia*

The Operations Room of HMAS *Melbourne* hummed with the particular tension of a warship testing its teeth. Banks of screens cast blue light across the faces of sailors hunched over their consoles, their voices a steady murmur of technical jargon and controlled urgency. The air smelled of electronics, coffee, and the faint tang of gun oil from the weapons systems one deck below.

Electronics Technician Riley McKenzie stared at his Air Warfare console with the focused intensity of a surgeon facing a difficult operation. The targeting display flickered between two different data formats—one crisp and precise, the other slightly offset and stuttering. He'd been wrestling with this sync error for three hours, and his patience was wearing thin.

""Come on, you bastard,"" he muttered under his breath, fingers dancing across the touch screen. ""Stop playing silly buggers with me. It's like they speak the same language, but they think in different idioms.""

A gentle laugh came from behind him. ""That is the challenge of all alliances, Electronics Technician. We will make them understand each other.""

McKenzie turned to see Mr. Kaito Tanaka approaching his station. The lead Japanese civilian engineer was a slight man in his fifties, wearing the blue coveralls of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. He'd been aboard *Melbourne* for fourteen months now, part of the technical team ensuring the Japanese Aegis combat system played nicely with Australian software and weapons. Despite the cultural barriers, he'd earned the ship's company's respect through patient competence and an uncanny ability to coax cooperation from temperamental electronics.

""Mr. Tanaka,"" McKenzie said, relief evident in his voice. ""The targeting handoff between the Japanese radar processor and our combat management system is still throwing errors. The data formats are compatible, but the timing is off by maybe twenty milliseconds. Enough to cause jitter in the display.""

Tanaka nodded thoughtfully, settling into the chair beside him. ""Show me the error logs.""

As McKenzie pulled up the diagnostic data, Captain Jax Miller stepped through the Ops Room's heavy blast door. At forty-two, Miller carried himself with the easy confidence of a career naval officer who'd earned his command through competence rather than politics. He'd been *Melbourne*'s captain for eight months now, since the previous CO had been promoted to commodore. The ship felt right under his command—responsive, professional, ready.

But ready for what was the question that kept him awake at night.

Miller paused at McKenzie's station, observing the troubleshooting process. The sync error was minor in the grand scheme of things, but in naval combat, milliseconds could mean the difference between a successful intercept and watching a missile slam into your ship. Every system had to be perfect.

""How are we progressing, Mr. Tanaka?""

The engineer looked up from the display. ""A software timing issue, Captain. Nothing fundamental. The Australian and Japanese systems are learning to dance together—it simply requires patience and small adjustments.""

Miller nodded. Eighteen months ago, when *Melbourne* had first been transferred from the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force under the Wellington-Canberra-Tokyo Accord, these integration challenges had seemed insurmountable. Now they were routine; irritating, but routine. The ship was Australian now, but her heart remained distinctly Japanese: the Aegis combat system, the radar arrays, the precision engineering that made her one of the most capable destroyers in the Pacific.

A necessary marriage in an uncertain world.

""Captain?"" His Executive Officer, Commander Sarah Wilson, appeared at his elbow. ""Could I have a word?""

Miller followed her to the bridge wing, stepping through the sliding door into the warm Australian morning. The ocean stretched endlessly in all directions, its surface broken only by the white wakes of *Melbourne*'s escort vessels—HMAS *Ballarat* and the Japanese destroyer *Haguro*, conducting joint exercises as part of what the media still called ""routine training.""

Nothing about their current posture felt routine.

""Loading's almost complete,"" Wilson said, nodding toward the forward deck where sailors were guiding the last SM-6 interceptor missiles into the Vertical Launch System cells. Each missile cost more than most people earned in a lifetime, but Miller was grateful to see them. ""Full magazine, Jax. Forty-eight cells loaded with the good stuff.""

Miller watched the precision choreography of the weapons loading, remembering a conversation he'd had last week with an American colleague. Commander Jake Grafton off USS *Mason* had described their deployment to the Red Sea with haunting matter-of-factness.

""Hope we don't burn through them as fast as the Yanks did in the Red Sea,"" Wilson continued, as if reading his thoughts.

""What did Walker tell you again?""

""Three hours, Jax. From full loadout to firing the Phalanx CIWS. Three bloody hours."" Wilson's expression was grim. ""Said they were finishing with cannons against cruise missiles. Thank Christ for the British strike that took out the Houthi launcher, or Grafton would've been swimming.""

The Red Sea Lesson, they'd started calling it in naval circles. The first real demonstration that even the world's most advanced navy could exhaust its magazine in a single afternoon of intense combat. Every captain in the coalition had studied the engagement reports, learning the uncomfortable truth that modern naval warfare was as much about ammunition management as tactical skill.

Miller's secure satellite phone buzzed. A priority message from the Pacific Defense Communications Initiative in Singapore. He glanced at the sender—Admiral Hammond, the Australian Chief of Navy.

""I'll be in the Ops Room,"" he told Wilson, heading back inside.

The Operations Room felt different now, charged with an energy Miller couldn't quite identify. McKenzie was running diagnostic checks on her targeting system, which appeared to be functioning normally. Tanaka stood nearby, wearing the satisfied expression of an engineer who'd solved a particularly stubborn problem. The Combat Systems Manager, Petty Officer First Class Davies, was coordinating with the Weapons Electrical Engineering Officer at the central console.

Near the PWO's chair, the duty watch supervisor was updating the tactical plot with information from Pine Gap's latest intelligence feed—one advantage of having Australia's own surveillance capabilities in the mix.

""System integration complete, Captain,"" McKenzie reported. ""All combat systems showing green across the board.""

""Good work. Let's see if it holds up under fire. Prepare for a live-fire exercise.""

The announcement went out across the ship's internal communication system: ""Now set live-fire exercise, live-fire exercise. This is not a drill. All hands stand clear of weapons danger areas.""

Miller moved to the command console at the center of the Ops Room, watching as his ship's company transformed from troubleshooters to warriors. The change was subtle but unmistakable—straighter postures, sharper movements, voices that carried just a hint more urgency. This was why they trained: for the moment when systems that existed only on paper became steel and fire and death.

""Drone target bearing two-seven-zero, range twelve miles,"" reported the sailor manning the Air Warfare console. ""Designating hostile air track Alpha-One.""

""PWO, you have tactical command,"" Miller announced. ""Engage with SM-2.""

Lieutenant Commander Maggie Thomas, the Principal Warfare Officer, stepped forward to the weapons console. ""Aye aye, sir."" Her fingers moved across the display with practiced precision. ""Track Alpha-One designated hostile. Combat system in auto-engage. VLS firing solution locked.""

The seconds stretched like hours. Miller could hear the subtle hum of the Aegis radar system cycling through its search and track modes, the whisper of air conditioning, the distant thrum of the ship's engines. Somewhere below, automated systems were selecting a missile, spinning up its guidance systems, preparing to unleash controlled destruction.

""Birds away!"" Thomas announced.

The ship shuddered slightly as compressed gas expelled the SM-2 missile from its launch cell. Through the Ops Room's cameras, Miller watched the missile's rocket motor ignite, transforming it from falling weight into guided lightning. The radar tracked both the missile and its target, two bright dots converging on the display with mathematical inevitability.

""Intercept in fifteen seconds,"" Thomas reported, her voice steady despite the magnitude of what they were doing. ""Missile is guiding, target is steady.""

Miller found himself holding his breath. Live-fire exercises were routine, but in the current climate, every demonstration of capability felt like preparation for something larger and darker.

""Impact.""

The drone target vanished from the display, transformed from flying machine to expanding cloud of debris in the space of a microsecond. A couple million dollars of Australian taxpayer money had just destroyed a fifty-thousand-dollar target, but the lesson was worth every penny: when the moment came, *Melbourne* would be ready.

""Excellent work,"" Miller told his ship's company. ""Secure from live-fire exercise. Return to standard watch rotation.""

As the Ops Room settled back into its normal rhythm, Miller's secure phone buzzed again. This time the message was longer, encrypted, and marked with the highest priority classification. He moved to his private terminal at the rear of the Ops Room and entered his authentication codes.

The message that appeared on his screen changed everything.

**FLASH PRECEDENCE**

**FROM: PDCI SINGAPORE**

**TO: ALL COALITION NAVAL COMMANDS**

**CLASSIFICATION: COALITION SECRET**

**EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY: COALITION READINESS STATE RED-ONE**

**ALL COALITION MARITIME ASSETS ARE AUTHORIZED TO ENGAGE ANY VERIFIED HOSTILE SURFACE, SUBSURFACE, OR AIR CONTACT DEMONSTRATING CLEAR INTENT WITHIN 50 NAUTICAL MILES OF DESIGNATED COALITION ASSETS.**

**RULES OF ENGAGEMENT UPDATED. ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT.**

**MESSAGE ENDS**

Miller stared at the screen, reading the message twice to ensure he understood its implications. RED-ONE was a designation they'd discussed in planning sessions but never expected to see implemented. It meant they were one step away from active hostilities. More importantly, it meant the authority to open fire had been delegated down to individual ship commanders like himself.

No more waiting for politicians to debate. No more clearance from distant admirals. If a Chinese submarine approached Melbourne with hostile intent, Miller now had the authority—and the responsibility—to sink it.

*Well, that's torn it*, he thought. *Here we go then.*

His hand hesitated over the keyboard for just a moment before typing the acknowledgment and closing the terminal, feeling the weight of command settle on his shoulders like a lead blanket. Around him, his ship's company continued their duties, unaware that the rules of the game had just changed fundamentally.

""XO,"" he called quietly.

Wilson appeared at his side. ""Sir?""

""I need to see the department heads in my cabin in thirty minutes. And send Mr. Tanaka my compliments—tell him his work today may have been more important than he realizes.""

Miller made his way through the ship's narrow passages to his cabin, a small but efficiently arranged space that served as both his private quarters and working office. The walls were lined with charts of the Western Pacific, their familiar coastlines and depth contours now taking on new significance. His desk held the usual captain's paperwork, but also something more ominous: the latest intelligence summary from the Pacific Defense Communications Initiative.

He pulled up the classified assessment on his laptop, scanning through reports that painted an increasingly grim picture. Chinese ""winter exercises"" had expanded to include over three hundred vessels—everything from front-line destroyers to civilian ferries pressed into military service. Satellite imagery showed massive stockpiles of fuel, ammunition, and supplies being assembled at staging areas along the Chinese coast.

Most troubling were the intelligence intercepts suggesting the Chinese were rehearsing specific communication protocols—not for exercises, but for what their own planning documents called ""Operation Sacred Sword.""

Miller leaned back in his chair, studying a photo on his desk. His wife Emma smiled back at him, their eight-year-old daughter Katie perched on her shoulders during a family trip to the Blue Mountains. It had been taken less than a year ago, but felt like a lifetime.

His secure satellite phone rang. Emma's face appeared on the screen, calling from their home in Sydney's northern suburbs. Even through the encrypted video connection, he could see the strain around her eyes.

""Hey, love,"" she said, her voice carrying that forced brightness people used when trying to appear normal. ""How's life on the high seas?""

""Not bad. We're keeping busy."" Miller glanced at the intelligence reports scattered across his desk, then back at his wife's face. ""How are things at home?""

""Katie's doing well in school. Her teacher says she's ahead in mathematics."" Emma paused, and Miller could hear the television in the background—something about protests in Michigan. ""Jax, the news has been... concerning lately. The situation in America, all this talk about China. Is it really as bad as they're making it sound?""

Miller chose his words carefully. ""There's a lot of tension right now. But we're well prepared, and we're working closely with our allies. The coalition is strong.""

""But is it going to be okay?"" The question carried the weight of every military spouse who'd ever asked it, and Miller had no easy answer.

""We're going to do everything in our power to make sure it is,"" he said finally. ""I love you both. Give Katie a hug from her old man.""

After ending the call, Miller sat in the growing darkness of his cabin, watching the sun set through his small porthole. The ocean stretched endlessly in all directions, deceptively peaceful in the golden light. But somewhere beyond the horizon, in ports and naval bases he could only imagine, other captains were staring at similar views and making similar calculations about the future.

The sea was calm. For now. But sensors never lied, and the sensors were painting a picture of massive forces in motion. Somewhere out there, people were fueling ships for a voyage they never planned to return from, loading weapons for battles that would reshape the balance of power in the Pacific.

Shortly, Miller would brief his department heads on the new rules of engagement. He would prepare his ship's company for the possibility that their next encounter with Chinese forces might not end with polite radio exchanges and professional courtesy. He would transform his ship from a training platform into an instrument of war.

But tonight, he allowed himself a few more minutes of peace, watching the last light fade from a world that was about to change forever.

In the Operations Room below, ET McKenzie ran one final diagnostic on her targeting system. All green lights. The Australian and Japanese systems were finally speaking the same language, thinking the same thoughts, preparing for the same uncertain future.

Integration complete.

# Chapter 17: Ultra-Quiet

**HMAS Sheean (SSG-77), Collins-class submarine** **South China Sea, 13 nautical miles southeast of Yulin Naval Base** *March 12, 2027 - 0347 Hours*

At three hundred feet beneath the South China Sea, the only sound louder than HMAS *Sheean*'s beating heart was the absence of it.

Commander Marcus Webb stood motionless at the periscope platform, his fingers resting lightly on the cold steel of the attack scope's handles. Around him, the control room existed in perpetual twilight—red battle lighting that preserved night vision and cast everything in shades of blood and shadow. Twenty-three souls moved through their routines with the precision of Swiss clockwork, each motion deliberate, necessary, practiced until it required no thought.

The ocean pressed against their steel cocoon with the weight of eternity—4.3 million pascals of pressure that would crush them in milliseconds if their fragile bubble failed. Inside that bubble, some of the most sophisticated acoustic sensors ever created listened to the darkness, transforming sound into sight.

""New contact, bearing three-two-zero,"" Leading Seaman Oliver ""Ollie"" Fitzgerald whispered from the sonar station, his voice barely disturbing the recycled air. His fingers danced across the waterfall display, parsing frequencies like a pianist reading sheet music. In another life, Fitzgerald had been first violin for the Sydney Youth Orchestra. Now he hunted warships with perfect pitch.

Webb moved to the sonar station in three measured steps. No wasted motion. In a submarine, efficiency wasn't just discipline—it was survival.

""Classification?"" Webb's voice matched Fitzgerald's whisper. After fifteen years in boats, stage-whispering was more natural than speaking.

Fitzgerald's eyes never left his screens. ""Stand by, sir... multiple tonals resolving... there."" His finger traced a harmonic line on the display. ""Seven-bladed screw, shaft rate indicates... twenty-two knots. Gas turbine harmonics..."" He paused. ""Skipper, it's our boy. Type 055. Signature matches intel.""

Webb felt his pulse quicken but kept his expression neutral. They'd been waiting four days for this moment, lurking like a patient spider just beyond Chinese territorial waters. The newest Type 055 destroyer—hull number 106, commissioned just six months ago—was about to give them her acoustic fingerprint.

""Tracking party, stand by,"" Webb ordered. The control room, already quiet, somehow grew quieter. ""Pilot, make your depth six-zero feet. Dead slow.""

""Six-zero feet, dead slow, aye sir.""

The submarine rose through the layers of pressure and temperature, each meter up increasing their vulnerability but improving their sensor picture. Webb gripped the periscope handles, waiting.

""Depth six-zero feet, sir. Trim stable.""

""Up scope.""

The attack periscope slid upward with a whisper of hydraulics. Webb gripped the periscope handles, the spiral grooves of the Pilkington's helical strakes cool beneath his palms. He pressed his face to the eyepiece, making a rapid 360-degree sweep before focusing on bearing 320. The predawn darkness was absolute, but there—a shadow against shadows, a geometric disruption of the horizon.

""Target visual. Type 055 confirmed."" He could make out her distinctive integrated mast, the angular radar arrays that made her one of the most dangerous surface combatants in the Pacific. ""Down scope.""

The periscope disappeared back into its well. Total exposure time: eight seconds.

""Sonar, commence acoustic recording. All stations, we are weapons tight, tracking only. This is an intelligence evolution.""

For twenty minutes, *Sheean* shadowed her prey, maintaining a distance of six thousand yards—close enough for clean recordings, far enough to avoid the destroyer's bow sonar. Fitzgerald worked his magic at the acoustic station, filtering out biologics, merchant traffic, and the destroyer's escorts to isolate the Type 055's unique sound signature.

Webb stood behind him, watching the waterfall display paint sound across time. Every ship had its own acoustic fingerprint—the specific combination of machinery noise, blade rate, harmonic frequencies that made it unique. With this recording, any Coalition submarine would be able to identify this specific destroyer at range, in any conditions.

""Sir,"" the Officer of the Watch spoke softly. ""ESM reports airborne radar, strength increasing. Probable helicopter launch from the target.""

Webb's jaw tightened. ASW helicopter. The destroyer was following standard procedure for leaving port—sanitizing the area around her.

""Pilot, make your depth two-zero-zero feet. Maintain steerage way only.""

They slipped deeper, trading sensor performance for protection. Through the hull, they could hear it now—the distinctive *thrum-thrum-thrum* of helicopter rotors transmitted through water.

""Sonar reports active buoy, bearing two-nine-zero!"" Fitzgerald's whisper carried urgency. ""Dipping sonar, three thousand yards and closing.""

Webb's mind calculated angles and distances. The helicopter was running a standard expanding box search. At its current pattern, it would pass almost directly over them in six minutes.

""How's our recording?""

""Sixty percent complete, sir. Need probably another eight minutes for a full profile.""

Eight minutes. The helicopter would be on top of them in six.

Webb touched the worn photo in his chest pocket—his daughter's kindergarten graduation, laminated and carried on every patrol for twelve years. Then his hands dropped, decision made.

""Chief of the Watch, ultra-quiet state, now.""

The order rippled through the submarine like a neural command. The already-quiet boat became a tomb. The low hum of ventilation fans died. Air conditioning compressors wound down to silence. Throughout the boat, machinery that had run continuously for weeks stopped.

In the galley, Able Seaman Kowalski froze mid-motion, a pan of tomorrow's breakfast held motionless in his hands. The coffee he'd been thinking about brewing would have to wait. In the engine room, watchstanders stood like statues at their posts. Nearly sixty men became mannequins, barely breathing.

The control room temperature immediately began to rise. Without ventilation, their body heat had nowhere to go. Sweat beaded on foreheads, but no one moved to wipe it away.

*Ping.*

The sonar pulse hit them like a physical blow, high-pitched and alien. The helicopter's dipping sonar, searching.

*Ping.*

Louder. Closer. ""Pattern's tight,"" Fitzgerald breathed, barely audible. ""Must be compressing the standard grid.""

Webb could see Fitzgerald's knuckles white as he gripped his station, still recording, still working despite the threat above.

*Ping.*

Leading Seaman Davies, nineteen years old and two weeks into his first deployment, stood frozen at the ballast control panel. A bead of sweat rolled down his nose, hung at the tip. Webb watched it from the corner of his eye, willing the boy not to move.

*PING.*

Directly overhead now. The acoustic energy washed over their hull like a searchlight. If they'd missed anything, if any machinery was still running, if anyone moved...

The drop of sweat fell from Davies' nose, hitting the deck with what seemed like thunderous impact. No one flinched.

*Ping.*

Fainter now. Moving away.

*Ping.*

Fitzgerald held up five fingers, then four. Recording almost complete.

*Ping.*

The Chinese helicopter was moving off, continuing its search pattern to the east. They'd been a hole in the water, invisible to the most sophisticated ASW sensors China could deploy.

Webb counted to one hundred in his head, then: ""Resume normal quiet state.""

The submarine came back to life in carefully orchestrated stages. Fans first, then air conditioning, then auxiliary machinery. The temperature began to drop. Davies finally wiped his forehead, his hand shaking slightly.

""Recording complete, sir,"" Fitzgerald reported. ""We have a full acoustic profile. Beautiful quality.""

""Very well. Pilot, make your depth three-five-zero feet. Come right to course one-seven-zero. Five knots.""

*Sheean* turned away from the Chinese coast, slipping back into the deep water where she belonged. They'd gotten what they came for—the acoustic fingerprint that would let any Coalition submarine identify and track China's newest destroyer.

""Officer of the Watch, stand down from tracking party. Secure from ultra-quiet.""

The tension broke like a snapped cable. Quiet conversations resumed. The Coxswain muttered just loud enough to be heard: ""Right then, who's the comedian who had the vindaloo last night? Davies nearly gave us away with his stomach growling.""

Davies flushed red. ""That wasn't my stomach, Cox'n...""

""No? What was it then, your knee joints? Sounded like someone strangling a cat.""

""It was the ballast control panel, Cox'n. Thermal expansion.""

The Coxswain's expression suggested what he thought of that explanation. ""Thermal expansion my arse. No more curry before patrol, got it?""

Webb returned to the navigation plot, already planning their exit route. In six hours, they'd be in international waters. In twelve, they'd burst-transmit their intelligence package to Fleet. The Coalition's submarine force would have another crucial advantage in the war everyone knew was coming.

He thought about the Type 055 cruiser now heading into the open ocean, her captain probably satisfied that his ASW screen had found nothing. That captain would never know how close they'd been, would never know his ship's acoustic signature had just been stolen by an invisible enemy.

That was the submarine service's gift to the Coalition—not glory, not recognition, but the quiet certainty that when the shooting started, their enemies would be fighting ghosts who already knew their names.

""Navigator,"" Webb said quietly, ""plot a course for deep water. Let's go home.""

*Sheean* slipped away into the darkness, carrying her stolen secrets back to the Coalition. Above them, 300 feet of ocean stood between them and the sky. Around them, 4.3 million pascals of pressure waited patiently for any mistake.

Inside their steel bubble, nearly sixty men—including one nineteen-year-old named Davies—had just proven that courage sometimes meant holding perfectly still while death searched for you in the darkness.

The ocean kept their secret, as it always had, as it always would.

  
**Chapter 27: Task Force Vigilance**

**Junior Sailors' Mess, HMAS** ***Melbourne*** **Subic Bay, Philippines** **April 5, 2027 - 1830 Hours**

The mess deck smelled of lamb roast and recycled air, the evening meal in full swing as Able Seaman Electronics Technician Riley McKenzie moved down the serving line. At twenty-one, he'd been in the Navy just long enough to know when something was brewing, and the scuttlebutt running through the lower decks had reached fever pitch.

""Heard the Yanks are pulling their carriers back to Pearl,"" muttered AB Kowalski from Engineering, loading his plate with enough food for two meals. ""My mate in Comms says they intercepted flash traffic about it.""

""Bullshit,"" Leading Seaman Davies countered, scratching at the fresh sunburn on his neck. ""They're sitting off Guam with their thumbs up their arses. Saw the satellite plot myself when I was fixing the crypto gear.""

McKenzie grabbed his tray and found a spot between them, the steel bench already sticky with condensation from the air conditioning working overtime in the Philippine heat. Through the mess deck's small portholes, he could see the lights of Subic Bay, the old American base now a bustling commercial port that still welcomed coalition warships.

""Did you see what they were loading from *Supply* this arvo?"" Another voice joined in—AB Thompson from the weapons department. ""Full loadout of Harpoons. And I mean full. Every cell that could take one.""

""And the torpedoes,"" whispered AB Rodriguez from sonar. ""Heard they're loading the Mk 48s too. That's not training stores, mate.""

""Pipe down, you bloody galahs."" Petty Officer Walsh appeared behind them like a bad hangover, twenty years of sea time etched into his weathered face. ""Spreading rumors in a mess deck? What are you, a bunch of fishwives?""

The junior sailors fell silent, but McKenzie caught the look in Walsh's eyes. The PO knew something—they all did. You didn't steam to Subic for a ""routine port visit"" and then spend two days loading weapons and stores like the world was ending.

McKenzie went back for seconds on dessert—the infamous ""duff"" that was somehow both gelatinous and grainy—earning immediate ridicule.

""Double-duffer alert!"" Davies announced. ""McKenzie's either stress eating or he's got a death wish for cookie's mystery pudding.""

""Maybe he knows something we don't,"" Thompson suggested. ""ET's always crawling through the cable runs. Hear anything interesting up there, mate?""

McKenzie shrugged, playing dumb. But he had heard things. Fragments of conversations from the Ops Room above. Officers using words like ""imminent"" and ""weapons free ROE."" The kind of talk that made a young sailor check his life jacket and practice his damage control drills.

The mess deck's television, perpetually tuned to CNN International, showed footage of Chinese ""exercises"" in the Taiwan Strait. The volume was down, but the images told the story—hundreds of grey ships moving in formation, helicopters lifting off destroyers, fighters screaming overhead.

""That's not a bloody exercise,"" someone muttered.

""Course it is,"" Walsh said, but his voice lacked conviction. ""Just like we're on a routine deployment. Now finish your scran and get ready for the evening watch. And if I hear any more of this gossip bullshit, you'll all be painting the anchor locker in this heat.""

As the sailors dispersed, McKenzie caught Walsh pulling Davies aside. The whispered conversation was brief, but McKenzie read the body language. *Get your department squared away. Check all the battle lanterns. Make sure your people know where their GQ stations are.*

McKenzie dumped his tray and headed for his berthing compartment. His rack—barely large enough to turn over in—was crammed with the detritus of five months at sea. Photos from home, qualifications guides, and tucked behind his pillow, the letter he'd written but never sent. The one that started with ""If you're reading this...""

Every sailor wrote one eventually. Most never sent them. But tonight, McKenzie pulled it out and stared at his mother's name on the envelope. Alice McKenzie, 47 Banksia Drive, Wagga Wagga.

Tomorrow, he decided. If they were still in port tomorrow, he'd tear it up.

But something told him they wouldn't be.

**Captain's Cabin, HMAS** ***Melbourne*** **April 5, 2027 - 2100 Hours**

Captain Jax Miller sat at his desk, the soft glow of his secure terminal painting shadows across a face that had aged five years in the last five months. The readiness reports from his department heads were spread before him, each one confirming what he already knew: *Melbourne* was as ready as she'd ever be.

The Engineering Officer's report was typically thorough—fuel at 95%, water generation running smoothly, all gas turbines operational. The Principal Warfare Officer had signed off on every weapons system. The Navigator had updated all charts for the Philippine Sea and beyond. Even the Supply Officer, perpetually pessimistic about their stores, admitted they were ""stored for war"" with provisions crammed into every available space.

His eyes drifted to the photo frame beside his monitor. Emma and Katie at Balmoral Beach last Christmas, building sandcastles while Sarah laughed at something off-camera. Four months since he'd seen them in person. Four months of encrypted emails and stuttering video calls that never quite bridged the distance.

The secure terminal chimed softly. Miller entered his authentication code, watching the message decrypt itself line by line. When it finished, only a single word remained on the screen:

**VIGILANCE**

He stared at it for exactly three seconds, then deleted the message and picked up the phone.

""Officer of the Watch,"" Lieutenant Jake Morrison answered on the first ring.

""Jake, make preparations to get underway. Quiet word to all departments—we sail in one hour.""

A pause, then: ""Aye, sir. I'll inform the Navigator and start the checklist.""

""And Jake? Signal the task force. Same timeline.""

""Understood, sir.""

Miller hung up and turned back to the photo. In the background, barely visible, was the Sydney Harbour Bridge. By the time he saw it again—if he saw it again—the world would be fundamentally different.

He opened his personal safe and removed a sealed envelope marked ""OPERATION VIGILANCE - COMMANDING OFFICERS EYES ONLY."" The authentication codes matched. Inside, coordinates for Station Luzon, rules of engagement that walked a tightrope between protection and provocation, and a single paragraph that made his blood run cold:

*Intelligence indicates PRC invasion of Taiwan imminent. Task Force Vigilance will position to interdict PLAN southern force if ordered. Under no circumstances will TF Vigilance fire unless fired upon. Preservation of coalition unity requires absolutely no preemptive action.*

*Note: Coalition submarine assets operating in theater. Vigilance AO cleared for surface operations only. Any submerged contact is HOSTILE.*

He burned the orders in his sink, watching the paper curl into ash. Outside his porthole, he could hear the sounds of a warship coming alive—hatches slamming, engines starting, the bosun's pipes calling sailors to their duties.

Miller pulled on his jacket and headed for the bridge. No speeches, no dramatics. Just another night getting underway, except everyone knew it wasn't.

**Operations Room, HMAS Melbourne** **April 5, 2027 - 2200 Hours**

The Ops Room existed in perpetual twilight, bathed in the red glow of battle lighting that preserved night vision and created an atmosphere of focused intensity. Above the main tactical display, Melbourne's ship's crest caught the dim light, a warship's silhouette beneath the Southern Cross, wrapped with the motto ""Vigilant and Victorious."" Tonight, Miller thought grimly, they'd need to live up to both. Every console was manned, every sailor a component in the room's mechanical precision.

""Task Force forming up nicely, sir,"" the Principal Warfare Officer, Lieutenant Commander Sandra Liu, reported from her position at the central command console. On the main tactical display, six blue icons moved through Subic Bay's approaches in perfect formation.

Miller settled into the command chair, feeling the familiar vibration of *Melbourne*'s gas turbines through the deck plates. Around him, the Ops Room hummed with quiet efficiency. The Weapons Electrical Engineering Officer ran through final checks with his team. The Combat Systems Manager verified data links with the other ships. Electronic Warfare operators monitored the electromagnetic spectrum for threats.

""Signal lamp from *Hobart*, sir,"" reported the Communications Officer. ""Captain Frost sends 'Ready to proceed.'""

Miller nodded. Tim Frost was solid—twenty-two years in the RAN, most of it in air warfare destroyers. If anyone could handle the technical complexity of coordinating two AEGIS systems, it was him.

""Vigilance Actual to all Vigilance units,"" Miller spoke into the command net. ""Report readiness.""

The responses came back crisp and professional, faces appearing on the secure video link:

""Vigilance Two, green."" Commander Tim Frost from *Hobart*'s bridge, the familiar bulk of his ship's SPY-1D radar array visible behind him.

""Vigilance Three, green."" Commander Jeff Martin from *Anzac*, his frigate's more modest combat center efficiently organized around him.

""Vigilance Four, green."" Commander Mark O'Sullivan from *Ballarat*, looking tired but determined after the frantic weapons loading.

""Vigilance Five, green."" Lieutenant Colonel Raj Patel from RSS *Formidable*, the Singaporean frigate's advanced electronic warfare suite visible in the background.

""Vigilance Six, green."" Colonel Made Sutrisno from KRI *Raden Eddy Martadinata*, his accented English clear and professional.

""Understood. Station Luzon is our objective. Maintain formation, weapons tight. Any submerged contact is to be considered hostile and reported immediately. Vigilance out.""

Miller cut the connection and studied the tactical display. Six ships, representing three navies, carrying the hopes of a dozen nations. The Americans might have abandoned their commitments, but the Pacific democracies would stand together.

""Sir,"" Liu said quietly, ""Electronic Support Measures are picking up increased activity to the west. Lots of search radars, communications traffic. The PLAN's definitely stirring.""

""Expected. What about to the north?""

""Still quiet around Taiwan proper, but that won't last.""

Miller leaned back in his command chair, watching the tactical picture update in real-time. Somewhere out there, probably within a hundred nautical miles, Coalition submarines were patrolling their own sectors. He wouldn't know where—that was the point—but it was reassuring to know they weren't completely alone.

""Captain,"" the Electronic Warfare Officer called out, ""I'm seeing what looks like Type 518 search radar, bearing two-eight-five, probably from a *Luyang* III destroyer. Long range, but they know we're here.""

""Very well. Continue monitoring.""

The night stretched ahead of them, six ships holding an invisible line in an empty ocean, waiting for orders that might never come or might arrive in the next five minutes. Miller had done this before—the long transit to the Gulf in '03, exercises off North Korea when the rhetoric got particularly heated—but this felt different.

## ⁢Key⁤ Features Analysis

The best mason jar vacuum sealers offer a‌ combination of powerful vacuum suction, ease of use, and durability. The following are critical features to consider when ⁣making your ‍selection.

**Vacuum Strength:** The effectiveness of ‍a mason jar vacuum sealer hinges on its⁣ ability to create a strong vacuum seal.

The‍ vacuum strength,measured in inches of mercury (inHg) or kilopascals (kPa),determines how much air is removed from​ the jar. A higher vacuum strength translates to a longer shelf life and better preservation of food quality. Look for sealers that offer at least 20 inHg (68 kPa) for optimal performance. Models⁣ with adjustable vacuum settings provide greater ‌control for​ delicate items.

**Compatibility:** ensuring broad compatibility with different jar ⁤sizes⁣ is crucial.

The ideal sealer should accommodate both ⁤regular-mouth and wide-mouth mason jars. Verify‍ that ⁢the⁤ included ‍accessories or adapter attachments‍ support these standard ​sizes.Some advanced models are even compatible with external vacuum canisters and bags, offering further versatility.Sealers that are only⁣ compatible with one jar size can be limiting, especially for⁣ users who have a variety of canning needs.

**Ease of Use:** ‌An intuitive design ensures a hassle-free sealing process.

Features such as‌ one-touch ‌operation, LED indicators, and automatic shut-off​ contribute to⁣ user-friendliness. The simpler the interface, the easier it ⁣will be to learn and use the sealer consistently. Consider models with clear instructions and ergonomic ‌designs to minimize strain⁣ during⁢ repeated use. Some models offer a built-in sensor ‍that detects when the vacuum is⁣ complete, ensuring a perfect seal every time.

**Portability and Storage:**‌ Compact size is desirable ‌for easy handling⁤ and simple storage.

Look for​ lightweight and portable devices that won't take‌ up too much⁢ counter space.‍ Models with cordless designs‌ and rechargeable batteries offer greater adaptability‍ in terms of placement‌ and usage. Consider ⁣built-in storage compartments for accessories,⁣ allowing for neat and organized storage when not in use. Cordless‍ models are particularly useful for ⁤users​ who ⁢have⁤ limited counter space or who want to take​ their sealer on the‌ go.**Durability and Build ⁣Quality:** Rugged construction ensures ⁢long-term reliability.

Opt for sealers made from high-quality materials, such as stainless steel or durable plastics, that can withstand frequent use. ​Pay attention to the sealing mechanisms and gaskets; these components should be robust and⁣ resistant to wear ⁤and tear.A longer warranty period is often an indicator of the manufacturer's confidence in the product's longevity. Regular cleaning and maintenance will also help prolong the life of the sealer.

key features of top-rated mason‌ jar vacuum sealers include:

## Core Benefits

Mason jar vacuum sealers​ offer a range of benefits that make them indispensable tools for food ⁢preservation and storage.

**Extended Shelf Life:** By ‍removing oxygen from the jar,‌ vacuum sealing substantially slows down the spoilage process. ⁤This helps maintain food freshness for a much longer period compared⁤ to traditional canning methods. For example, dried herbs and spices can retain their potency for months longer when⁤ vacuum sealed, ⁣and homemade jams and jellies are less likely to mold or ferment.**Reduced Food​ Waste:** ‍With vacuum sealing,⁣ you can confidently store leftovers, bulk‌ purchases, and seasonal produce without worrying about ‌rapid spoilage.This minimizes food waste​ and saves money in the long⁤ run by reducing the ​need to discard unused portions. For instance, vacuum sealing opened bags of chips or crackers will keep them from going stale, ensuring that ‌you can enjoy them for weeks without any loss of taste or quality.

**Preservation of Flavor and Nutrients:** Vacuum sealing minimizes oxidation ⁣and nutrient​ loss, preserving the original flavor and nutritional value of your stored food. This is particularly important ‌for ​delicate ingredients like fruits, vegetables,‌ and herbs, wich can quickly lose⁢ their⁢ taste⁢ and vitamins⁢ when ⁤exposed to air. Vacuum sealing helps maintain the integrity of these foods, ensuring ​that you get the maximum nutritional benefit from your stored items.

**Protection Against Freezer⁢ Burn:** vacuum ‌sealing​ eliminates air pockets around frozen foods, preventing freezer ⁤burn and maintaining the texture and flavor of your frozen goods.This is especially ⁢beneficial for meats,⁤ poultry, and seafood, which can become dry ‌and unappetizing if subjected to freezer burn. Vacuum sealing ensures ‍that your frozen foods⁢ remain fresh and flavorful⁤ for months.

**Organized ‍Pantry and Fridge:** Vacuum sealing allows⁢ for ​neat and space-saving storage of food items, both in the pantry and in the refrigerator. Sealed jars can be stacked neatly, maximizing space and making it easy to find what you need. This can significantly improve organization in your kitchen, ‍creating a more efficient and user-friendly storage system.

## FAQs Section

**Are mason jar vacuum sealers compatible with all types​ of mason jars?**

Most quality mason jar vacuum sealers are primarily designed to ‍work with standard mason jars that have a two-piece lid consisting of a⁤ flat lid and a metal ring. Some sealers come with adapters to accommodate both regular-mouth and wide-mouth jars, while others are specifically tailored to one size or the other. It's essential to check⁤ the product specifications to ensure compatibility with the types‌ of ‌jars you plan to use.

**How long will food last in a ‌vacuum-sealed mason ⁢jar?**

The shelf life of food stored⁣ in vacuum-sealed mason jars depends on several factors, including the type of food, the initial ​quality‌ of the ‍food, and⁢ the storage conditions. ‌Generally, vacuum sealing can significantly extend the shelf life‌ of manny items.Such as, ‍dry goods like grains, beans, and pasta can last for several years⁢ when vacuum-sealed, while refrigerated ‌items may last up to‍ twice as long as they would without vacuum sealing. Always follow proper‌ food safety guidelines to ‌ensure the quality and safety ‌of your ⁣stored food.

**Can I reuse the ‍lids after vacuum sealing?**

The metal lids used with​ mason jars are typically not ⁢recommended for reuse when ‍vacuum ‌sealing for long-term storage.While you can reuse the lids for regular canning or⁤ short-term storage, the sealing compound on ⁢the lids may degrade after multiple uses,‌ potentially compromising the airtight ⁣seal.though, some specialized reusable lids designed specifically for vacuum sealing are available on the market. These lids are made from durable materials and can be used repeatedly, making them a cost-effective and environmentally friendly option.

**How do I clean and maintain a mason jar vacuum sealer?**

I live out of my birth country which doesn't help.,"My wife (29F) and I (29M) have been together for \[X years\] and this might sound petty, but shopping has become a daily source of stress in our relationship.

Here's what happens: She asks me to ""grab coffee"" or ""pick up shampoo."" I get to the store and realize I have no idea which specific brand/type she wants. I text her, she tries to describe it, I get the wrong thing anyway. She gets frustrated, I get frustrated, and we end up in this stupid argument about coffee brands.

Living abroad makes it worse because I'm dealing with unfamiliar brands in a second language, so even her descriptions don't help much.

We've tried shopping list apps, but they're useless for this. Writing ""coffee"" doesn't tell me if she wants the beans, ground, decaf, or which of the 20 brands she actually likes.

I love my wife and want to help with errands, but these shopping trips are starting to cause real tension between us. She thinks I'm not paying attention to her preferences, and I feel like I'm being set up to fail.

For someone like me who starts their day with a coffee ritual, this espresso machine felt like it could become a crucial part of the routine.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed when unboxing it was how compact and stylish it is. Measuring at 14""D x 8.6""W x 10.4""H, it fits perfectly on my small kitchen counter. The design feels premium, and it strikes a great balance between aesthetics and functionality. Its use of 35% recycled plastic makes it eco-friendly which is definitely a point I value. The Liquorice Black color blends effortlessly with almost any kitchen decor, and even my friends have commented on how cool it looks sitting there. The adjustable drip tray is a thoughtful touch, accommodating both standard mugs and my unnecessarily tall travel tumbler.  

[Check Nespresso ENV92B price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b0dvd67f76/)  

**Brewing Technology**  
Over the past few weeks, I’ve dug deep into the machine’s Centrifusion technology. It reads the barcode on each Vertuo capsule and tweaks everything from spin speed to brewing time. Watching it brew feels oddly futuristic as it spins the capsule with precision. This tech delivers consistent flavor, and honestly, the richness of aroma and taste in every cup made me wonder if I was ever actually drinking real coffee before this. I’ve tested all five brew sizes—Espresso, Double Espresso, Gran Lungo, XL Coffee, and even the Cold Brew style. Whether I was feeling adventurous or just needed a classic kick, this machine delivered every time.  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
I can’t say enough how easy this thing is to use. One button does all the magic—no complicated setup or endless scrolling through menus. Just pop the capsule in, press, and wait for that luxurious crema to form. Trust me, the crema on this coffee is unmatched. Furthermore, cleaning hasn’t been a chore. The removable tank and parts make it easy to handle, and a quick rinse is usually all it takes. It also syncs with a smartphone app, keeping me updated with descaling reminders and software updates. Who knew coffee machines could be this tech-savvy?  

**Performance Under Pressure**  
My busy mornings go something like this: stumble out of bed, fumble for the coffee machine, and hope for a hot, life-affirming cup ASAP. The Nespresso ENV92B delivers—heating up in just 30 seconds and shutting off automatically afterward. If I forget to turn it off, it has my back. This has turned into one of my favorite features, considering how often I rush out the door. I’ve tried everything from iced coffee capsules to XL mugs of morning brew, and every cup has been consistently flavorful.  

**Highlights**  
- Compact and stylish build fits effortlessly in small spaces.  
- Centrifusion technology extracts rich flavors efficiently.  
- Easy to clean, with removable parts and app support.  
- Adjustable drip tray accommodates multiple cup sizes.  

**Pitfalls**  
I’ll be honest, not everything is perfect. There are a few quirks:  
- The machine only works with Nespresso Vertuo capsules, which restricts you to their ecosystem.  
- While the App updates are neat, they might feel redundant for less tech-savvy users.  
- Capsules can start adding up cost-wise if you’re a frequent coffee drinker like me.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to competitors like Keurig’s single-serve brewers or the Breville Bambino, this espresso machine stands out for its intricate brewing technology. The Keurig offers versatility with third-party pods, but it can’t compete with the richness or crema you get from the Nespresso. The Breville Bambino, on the other hand, delivers authentic espresso but lacks the convenience of pre-portioned capsules, making it a bit less user-friendly for beginners.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
I’d say this espresso machine strikes a good balance between luxury and practicality. For its performance and features, it feels like a smart investment. While yes, there are cheaper alternatives with less advanced brewing systems, you'd be likely sacrificing flavor consistency and build quality. Ultimately, this is for someone who values convenience, aesthetics, and quality in one package.

Hey everyone! Let’s take a moment to talk about something we’ve all seen in the headlines. You’ve probably noticed how fast AI is taking over jobs and transforming industries. 🤖 It feels like one day we’re just using our laptops to send emails, and the next, machines are writing articles, coding, and even doing our schedules. Crazy, right?

But here’s the thing: **if we sit back and do nothing, we might as well hand our paychecks to those shiny new bots.** I mean, who wants to be that person who says, “I remember when I could be a content writer and not get competed out by an algorithm!” 🎤 *Mic drop.* 

So, why not take this as a cue to level up our game? Here are some actionable tips to stay ahead of the curve:

1. **Explore AI tools:** Jump into platforms like ChatGPT for brainstorming or Jasper AI for content creation. It’s like having a sidekick with superpowers. 🦸
   
2. **Invest in online courses:** Seriously, there are tons of educational programs out there (check out this cool one: [Imagine AI Education](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals)). It’s the perfect way to outsmart those pesky algorithms by learning how to use them to your advantage! It’s like when you learned to ride a bike; the more you practice, the smoother the ride!

3. **Join communities:** Engage in forums, networks, and even casual groups. Sharing ideas and learning from peers can spark innovation. Plus, can we agree that nothing beats a group discussion over a hot cup of coffee—or, you know, whatever fuels your vibe?

4. **Experiment and create:** Don’t be afraid to dabble. Write, design, or code something with AI help! You might just invent the next viral trend. 🤯

5. **Stay informed:** Subscribe to newsletters or podcasts that focus on AI advancements. Being aware of trends will keep you ahead of the curve. It’s like having your finger on the pulse of the future while everyone else is busy scrolling through cat memes. (Though we all love a good cat meme, let’s be real.)

And hey, let’s sprinkle in a bit of humor here. Ever heard someone say, “I’m just too busy to learn!”? Honestly, news flash, **the world won’t slow down for you!** So either you hop on the train, or you find yourself in the back of the bus, watching everyone else zoom past. 🚀

This isn’t about fear; it’s about **embracing change** and turning it into an opportunity. There’s so much we can do right now to not just survive the age of AI but thrive in it! 🌱

So, are you ready to upskill and make sure your AI $$$ doesn’t vanish into thin air? The future is bright, my friends—let’s rock this thing together! What’s the first step you’re going to take? 🤔",1,1752927899.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I made the mistake of posting this on my Public Snapchat profile and not my friends only one. I got a DM from someone saying they’re on a military base and they’re not around much women, but they liked my hands and nails and wondered if I had cute feet. They wanted to pay me money to send feet pictures. I’d like to take accountability by realizing that’s incredibly weird and that I shouldn’t have followed it up, I should’ve blocked this person and wrote it off, but I didn’t. If I had done that, I wouldn’t be in the situation I am in now. I engaged and went back and forth and was like, “oh. Wellllll, he doesn’t seem like a weirdo, so okay. Maybe. We’ll see.” I was in a rough spot financially and thought, “oh, you want pictures of my feet for money? Deal.” Not the best judgement as I felt iffy about it when it happened, but I looked past my own personal moral compass. Clearly, I did it. I sent a total of four pictures: three of my feet and one of me bent over with my feet showing, and all in all, I got paid $140 for it. The whole time he and I are talking, he’s like, “you have really pretty feet. People would pay big money for your feet. You should think about selling pictures; not even just to me.” And I told him repeatedly this isn’t for me, you already paid and you’re not giving me the creeps, I just do it with you. I, however, never really felt good about it and honestly started feeling a bit shameful that I engaged like this with a stranger. It’s just not in my personal moral code. I wanna make it a point to say I support sex workers and their choice to do the things they wanna do for their money, but it’s just personally not for me. I hope I am not coming off as judgmental as that’s the last thing I wanna do; sex work is their work. I didn’t want to engage anymore. I sent him back the $140 through Cashapp, and on Snapchat, told him thank you for the help, but I’m just not interested in this anymore. He tried to push back, but I told him to keep the money, I didn’t want it. All in all, we talked for about three weeks to a month, maybe a month and a half.

Fast forward to now, 2025. I’m doing better and I haven’t sold any pictures since that one time. There’s this guy, who I’ve seen in passing since he runs in a crew of guys who I know and I’m actually really cool with, who continuously messages me on Snapchat. If I post a picture, he replies to it and tells me I am beautiful and that my feet are pretty, etc etc. I normally hearted his messages and go on about my way. However, he increasingly started asking me to sell him feet pictures, which I denied every single time and told him that’s not something I do, I’m not interested, please stop, I’ve been telling you no for years… no, no, NO. he then says to me two days ago, “it’s crazy that you’re telling me no when I’ve personally bought pictures from you before. But I guess you have an image to keep up. That’s nonsense. I know how to move with you now” in a Snapchat message. I’m like ??? Oh, shit. I piece things together. He lied about who he was, made an entirely new profile, and then hmu as if he never knew who I was. He pretended he was a stranger. I felt violated. I sent him a message back saying:

“ and if you did, that's great. I hope you enjoyea them! It's not ""keeping up an image"" for anything, I did it once with you and that was that. I don't do it, period. That's it, that's all. It has nothing to do with me knowing you (which I barely do, l've seen you in passing here and there) but still. That's kinda crazy to be like, two years later it was me the whole time, but it is what it is lol. I sent you pictures of my feet and you paid for them, that was it and I ended up sending you the money back anyway so what is the point?”

I then sent him another message and said, “God bless you!” as I’m trying not to be rude or upset him even though he was rude to me. I was scared if I really said how I felt, he would threaten me. He blocks me on Snapchat, then leaves a comment on a IG post of mine from a burner account, “ You sent them to ***********. I still have the screenshots & cash apps. Just make sure you don't send those out or I will too” It almost seems to me as if he is shameful of paying for feet pictures and doesn’t want it come out. He also paid me one time to tell him about the last time I was intimate with someone and seemed to really get off on that. Under his actual account, He would always send messages like, “you don’t want a trick? You don’t want anyone to give you some money just for being pretty? I can keep a secret. Girls like guys with money.” I never put two and two together that the language and voice is the same as the account when he pretended to be a stranger and bought pictures of my feet.

Of note, I never got a notification he saved the four pictures I sent, so, it has me wondering if he took pictures of the screen from another phone and still has the pictures. I refunded him the money in full of what he sent me, so, I’m not understanding why he is bringing this up now, two years later. I did SS Snapchat messages; I wanted to have proof of what really went on in case he tried to put anything out and made it seem like it was more than what it truly was. I am now blocked on his burner IG, too. From his personal IG, he blocked me as well.

Since two days has passed and nothing has happened, I’m battling through emotions of fear, anxiety, embarrassment and most of all, shame. I’m shameful that I did such a thing for money when I didn’t feel good about it at all when I did it. I feel stupid and embarrassed that I got tricked by someone like this and now, this weirdo person has this thought of me in their head and they can release information (thank God, I have screenshots showing the full story), just bothers me. I know this may seem minor, but I’m struggling with my feelings. I just hope I can resolve them soon and I can put this situation behind me.",6,1752927704.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Chicken. Sour Cream. Coffee. 

This makes sense if you're familiar and acute to the specific wants but if you're shopping for multiple people and everyone has preferences, how do you juggle this more efficiently?

1m3uw0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1m3uw0s/what_are_the_different_types_of_keurig_coffee/,What are the different types of Keurig coffee makers?,"As someone who's been using Keurig machines for over 5 years, I want to break down the different types of Keurig coffee makers to help you choose the right one for your needs.

I've tested multiple models, and I'll share my honest experience with each type. Let's dive into the main categories:

Classic Keurig Models
These are your standard single-serve coffee makers. The K-Classic and K-Select are perfect for basic coffee brewing. They're straightforward to use - just pop in a K-cup, choose your cup size, and press brew. If you're looking for a reliable machine that makes regular coffee without fancy features, check out the current deals on classic models here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

Plus Series
The Plus series, including the K-Supreme Plus and K-Elite, offers more brewing options. You get temperature control, strong brew settings, and even iced coffee features. I particularly love the K-Supreme Plus for its MultiStream technology, which extracts more flavor from each pod.

Office and Commercial Models
The K-150 and K-155 are built for office use. They have larger water reservoirs and can handle heavy daily use. These machines connect directly to water lines, so you don't need to refill them constantly.

Specialty Brewers
The K-Cafe and K-Latte models are my personal favorites for making specialty drinks. They come with milk frothers and can brew concentrated shots for lattes and cappuccinos. If you enjoy coffeehouse-style drinks, these are worth considering.

Smart Brewers
The K-Supreme Smart is Keurig's newest innovation. It connects to your phone and remembers your favorite settings. While it's pricier, the customization options are impressive.

Mini Models
The K-Mini and K-Mini Plus are perfect for small spaces. They're about 5 inches wide and ideal for dorm rooms or small kitchens. The trade-off is a smaller water reservoir.

You can compare all these models and find the best deals here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

Important Features to Consider:
- Water reservoir size (from 48 oz to 96 oz)
- Cup size options (4-12 oz)
- Temperature control
- Strength control
- Maintenance alerts
- Auto-off feature
- Display type
- Compatible pod types

My top recommendation? The K-Supreme Plus. It hits the sweet spot between features and price, and the coffee quality is noticeably better than basic models.

Remember that all Keurig machines need regular cleaning and descaling. Also, while most models work with all K-cups, some newer ones only accept Keurig-branded pods.

I hope this helps you choose the right Keurig for your coffee needs. Let me know if you have any questions about specific models!",1,1752927640.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

My first thought is, ""What must I do to make sure my client/patient is okay?""

I WILL call you or send you a message. Don't worry, I'm NOT going to hide it from you. 

But bombarding me with phone calls and messages because I called someone to quickly help me get them up because I'm not strong enough on my own... no, man. 

I don't mind the extra helper reaching out and telling you. That was the person the patient felt most at ease with in that moment of confusion and distress. I'm not going to leave them on the floor alone while I call you to tattle. I'm on the floor or on the bed or whatever with them. I didn't wait 4 hours to call for help. I tried myself, saw I wasn't going to manage, and called someone 4 minutes away. 10 seconds later they had your family member up and on the bed!

Can I just get the patient/client on the bed and blanket over them? Maybe a cup of sweet tea or Coke or orange juice just to help calm their nerves? 

You're +6 hours away. What... you're not here to assess the situation. 

I don't have 50 hands. I don't have 30 ears. I don't have 10 mouths. I can't do everything at once.

Let me use my common sense, my logic, my skills and knowledge (I know you might not think it's a lot, but have a little faith?) to FIRST help grandma or grandpa or mom or dad up. 

Let me check that they didn't first hurt a head or neck or back. I know I must check for open wounds, I know I must check movement capabilities. Let me check they didn't hit their head and maybe have a concussion. I know not to just swoop in and push someone around. 
(Guuuuuurl, I saw how the close family friend just ripped the patient's arm out of the long shirt sleeve... maybe the arm injury is from that, not my gentle, slow assistance? Like??? When the patient is closer to 90 than 80, nooooo, don't play tug-of-war with their body parts!)

Do you realise how much of a shock it is so fall at such an old age? Their heads are everywhere. They feel scared, embarrassed, hurt, uncomfortable, disappointed, shocked. 

I know you're worried. Or I at least hope you are. I would be worried too. 

You weren't open and honest to me about them and their health. But I'm still going to do the best that I can, and do it safely. 

Let me just be there for them and assist them first, please?

If I don't know what to do, or if it's is serious or something I'm unsure about, I'll contact someone. I'll ask your hospital and doctor preferences. If I need an ambulance, I'll call for help. I know I'm not qualified for many things. I'm not going to do open heart or closed heart surgery. 

Just give me a minute. 

Chill. Chill pill. Have I ever hidden something like this from you? No. I send photos. I send updates. You get your 10 minute voicenotes with me giving a full day update of anything going wrong. 

I'm not going to worry you if I couldn't work out the microwave for two days (if I could warm things another way and eventually figure out what I was doing wrong). That's silly. Am I going to bother you because they messed some tea/coffee on their shirt and I insisted they change their shirt? Nah. Happens to all of us. But I'll keep you up to date with important things like your grandma's/mom's or grandpa's/dad's health. 

In that moment of accident and problem-solving, YOU are not my priority. The PATIENT is.

1m3urp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m3urp6/have_we_met_before/,Have we met before ?,"Hello again, or, is it just, hello? Have we met this time around? There are too many people to remember them all, so forgive me if I forget your name. I need your help, I don't know how I wound up in this situation but I seem to have been ground hog day'd. I have seen the world ending thousands of times and I need someone to help me.

It wasn't world ending apocalypses initially it started out with small things, I'd get hit by a car and die, so the next time round I would wait till the car went past, then cross the street. Just little things like that, after the first hundred or so times around though, things started to get a little more extreme, the first such example was a man with a knife who charged me and stabbed me to death, so I called the police ahead of time. They made it, stopped him from attacking me and hit me with a stray bullet when the knife man charged them. After that, I took a different route to the coffee shop. The first time I actually made it to the coffee shop a gas line exploded when I arrived and killed me, and, I assume everyone else there at the same time.

After that I decided to try and leave town, so I went to catch a train, which promptly derailed and took out everyone on the platform as it did so. The strange thing is though, that I checked the news while I was on the platform and the gas line didn't explode this time around.

That got me thinking, if bad things were only happening to kill me, what if I just stayed home and waited it out. Well, the only time I tried that I was the victim of a plane crash in my own livingroom. I decided that my best course of action was to wander the city for the day and do my best to be aware of my surroundings, and wouldn't you know it, it got me further than anything I'd tried so far, but ultimately failed when we were hit with a chemical weapon strike

At that point I came to the decision that I should stay away from crowds to minimize the casualties, the problem was that I didn't own a car, so my options were public transport or walk, and public transport hadn't treated me well today. I started walking first thing in the morning, by noon I was on the city outskirts with lifestyle blocks lining the highway. I made sure to stay well away from any vehicle that I saw on the road. That, of course, didn't stop the bombs from killing me. I turned around after the bright flash and, a couple seconds later, woke up back in my bed. The next few attempts I tried running, but for the first time, the exact cause of death repeated itself. That's when I realized that the only way to prevent an event was to be safely out of it's reach. I spent a few attempts trying to find the most accessable bike I could to “borrow”, after a few attempts I found that one of the bikes at the convenience store had been left unlocked. That time I made it to the next town over, turns out, they were quite earthquake prone. It took a few attempts, but I eventually found a safe spot to weather the earth quake.

The declaration of war came next several world leaders were assassinated all at once and everyone blamed everyone else, and then the missiles began to fly, and, surprise surprise, the first nuke hit the town in was in. Interestingly enough, if I didn't go to that town, the war didn't happen, I figured that since I was far enough from that first nuke that I didn't die immediately, then it had to be a different cause of death.

I had taken to keeping up with the news to try and avoid anything that seemed dangerous. I basically gave up when I saw that a virus had swept across more than half of the Continental United States in a matter of hours, leaving very few survivors in its wake. The experts were saying 97% of the population was dead within 5 minutes of first symptoms, and believe me, it was not a comfortable 5 minutes. After that I tried to break the loop myself a couple of times, if you catch my drift. That, evidently also didn't work. That's when I had an idea scuba gear should have enough oxygen for me to last at least the initial pass of the virus, and if the pattern holds, that meant that it wouldn't happen at all. I was right, I looked like an idiot in a stolen scuba mask, but I was right. That still didn't stop the meteor though, and that's where I've been stuck for the past few hundred days, 3.37pm, the world ends. And I don't know if there is any way, aside from breaking the time loop, to stop it. Which brings us to the reason I'm writing this now. I think I have figured out a way to break it. I've spent a few decades at this point studying mythology about time loops and I think I know which one I'm in.

Are you familiar with the concept of purgatory? Well, it's kind of like that, except, I'm not dead yet, and it's contagious. It's a punishment and once I have made amends and attoned for my sins, I believe I will be set free. It also turns out that, by sharing my knowledge I have spread the reach of this curse. Thank you all, for taking on a portion of my suffering and making penance for my sins.

If you want my advice, don't dodge the car, it hurts a lot less than the feeling of you lungs liqufying in you chest.
