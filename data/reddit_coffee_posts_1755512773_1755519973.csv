847 people agree that this changed their lives. lol.

The platform has turned into a weird hybrid of motivational Instagram and corporate fanfiction. Most of the posts read like:

*""I was at Starbucks when the barista said 'Have a nice day'*

*This taught me 3 things about customer retention:* 

*1. Always smile (even dead inside)* 

*2. Eye contact = trust*

*3. Basic human decency is a competitive advantage*

*Agree? Thoughts? What would you add?""*

And somehow this gets more engagement than actual market analysis from people with 10+ years of experience.

**The worst part?** Good creators are starting to write like this because it's the only way the algorithm notices them. So now everyone sounds like a LinkedIn bot trying to turn buying coffee into a business lesson.

I miss when LinkedIn was just people humblebragging about their promotions and posting blurry conference selfies. At least that was honest. haha

During these years, I was responsible several times for supporting my colleagues and customers in Eastern Europe, and even, because of the language (I'm Spanish), in the LATAM region.

They asked me to go to a meeting on a Monday morning at one of our offices, 1100 km from my home (that's 680 miles or 10,000 football fields, for the Americans). This forced me to travel on Sunday.

On that Monday, after working for 3 hours with the rest of the team on strategies and actions for the different markets and clients, my manager, who had come from Germany, told me he needed to talk to me during the coffee break.

He was waiting for me in a room with the HR Director and the Country Manager.

""We are happy with your performance, but we have to let you go because you are too expensive and we are making cutbacks.""

All I said, sarcastically, was:

""I would be expensive if I didn't bring significant profit to the company, regardless of my salary.""

They showed me my severance package and I had to speak again:

""Remember when you made me sign a 'golden parachute agreement' which stipulated I couldn't leave the company without giving you a year's notice? Well, it also obligates the company to compensate me with a full year's salary and bonus if you are the ones who fire me.""

They kept calling me for a month to help them with some clients or scientific research that was still unfinished. I asked them for 1000 euros per day for 8 hours of work or 600 for a half-day, with expenses separate, of course. In the end, they stopped bothering me.

The best part of all this: tomorrow I will sign on as the Technical Director for the EMEA region with the largest company in the world in my field, their direct competitor (and since they were the ones who fired me, the non-competition clauses do not apply).",5,1755519393.0,CSCareerHacking,0,1.0,False

I am fairly new to the church I go to, been there a year. This church is clicky and it‚Äôs been very difficult to connect with people there because it‚Äôs small and clicky. I am an introvert but have been making an effort to push myself to find a new person to talk to after church during coffee and donuts. The conversations have always been positive and go well. 

Here is the issue: there is one lady, who is not part of the conversation I am having or even standing around the group/person that I‚Äôm talking to and she will walk up and interrupt me and who I‚Äôm speaking with to ask them something that inevitably pulls them away from me. Knowing obviously that this person is already talking to me. Here are a couple of examples of what she has done: Ex. ‚ÄúHey could you come talk to this person over here that is wondering about this thing‚Äù or Ex. ‚ÄúHey, are you going to be at this thing next week, I‚Äôd like to make plans with you.‚Äù And then the person I‚Äôm taking to excuses themselves and walks away and I am inevitably left by myself. The same lady had done this to me twice. I haven‚Äôt said anything because she doesn‚Äôt even make eye contact with me, I‚Äôm completely ignored by her and it feels like I would be making a bigger deal about it than what is called for but it also really bothers me and I feel very disrespected.

Some additional details: the lady interrupting is someone who I don‚Äôt particularly care for because my observation is that she is disingenuous, gossipy and not someone I would trust to become friends with. That said, I am always polite to her or don‚Äôt go out of my way to be salty, because that‚Äôs just not my style. She tends to be rude in the way she carries herself and engages with me. For example, someone set up a meal train when she had a baby and they sent it out to whole church. I signed up and brought her some food. I never received a thank you text or acknowledgment of any kind. Which is the first time that has ever happened to me, I always sign up for new moms so it‚Äôs been 20+ times and I usually at least get a text saying ‚Äúthank you‚Äù or ‚ÄúI appreciate the food‚Äù

Addicts are often not just addicted to the substance itself but to the feel good emotions they get from the substance, thanks to dopamine and other brain chemicals, therefore:

What do you think about people who do it for recreational purposes? Do you think it is recreational until the person just loses control over the substance and lies to themselves when in fact they are addicted?

I personally see it just as an easy way out to escape reality, so I associate it with mental weakness as they seek immediate pleasure.

 In today's 12-minute lesson, Stephen Davey explores three immediate results of their rebellion:

Loss of their original splendor - the brilliance of God's glory was gone.

2. Futility of hiding from God - you can run, but you can't hide from your Creator.

God's question, ""Where are you?"" is not about geography but about relationship. He already knows the worst about you, yet He still offers forgiveness through Jesus Christ.

# Discussion Questions:

* Why is it important to understand that God already knows the worst about us?
* How does this truth change the way we respond to our own sin?

https://reddit.com/link/1mtk20c/video/ds0swzu6prif1/player

# Full Lesson Transcript Below

**Losing the Legacy**

*Genesis 3:7-9*

Today we‚Äôre going to look at the consequences of Adam and Eve‚Äôs sin against God. We‚Äôll simply call this the immediate results of a spoiled legacy. And those results have affected us to this very day, because we‚Äôre just like the first couple‚Äîsinners in need of a Redeemer.

The first thing I want you to know is that¬†*Adam and Eve experienced the loss of their original splendor.*

Now in our last study in Genesis chapter 3, we learned how Eve fell for Satan‚Äôs schemes. She ate the forbidden fruit and then tempted her husband to sin as well. And while eventually they would die physically as a result, some other things immediately changed.

Verse 7 tells us,¬†‚ÄúThen the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked.‚Äù¬†

Now what many people have done with this text is make Adam and Eve suddenly blush with embarrassment that they‚Äôre not wearing any clothes. Well, they‚Äôve known that for some time already.

Do you know what happened when Moses met with God on the mountaintop? There in the presence of God‚Äôs glory, Moses‚Äô face began to glow. He didn‚Äôt have a mirror up there on Mount Sinai, so he wasn‚Äôt even aware of it.

But when Moses came down that mountain, the people couldn‚Äôt bear to look at him because of the glow. So, Moses had to wear a veil over his face whenever he went out in public according to Exodus 34.

Adam and Eve were created in the presence of God‚Äôs glory. They walked with God in the cool of the evening. Genesis 3:8 indicates they had daily, personal exposure to God‚Äôs glory.

Imagine their daily exposure to the glory of God. If the face of Moses shone, can you imagine the physical brilliance of Adam and Eve?

The prophet Daniel says that one day the redeemed will shine like the brightness of the stars forever and ever¬†(Daniel 12:3). Is he exaggerating?

Zechariah 9:16 says God‚Äôs people shall one day sparkle like the jewels of a crown in the coming kingdom of God. And Jesus promised in¬†Matthew 13:43¬†that the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.

There‚Äôs no reason to ignore these promises or refuse to take them literally. The people of God will one day shine in their glorified bodies with the restored brilliance of God‚Äôs original design.

God‚Äôs going to turn the light back on, and the believer in heaven will shine with that light that was lost by Adam and Eve.

Now back here in the garden, as soon as Adam and Eve sin, God turns off the light. They lose their clothing of brilliant splendor, and they immediately know it. All of a sudden, they‚Äôre standing there looking at each other in unadorned nakedness.

And they‚Äôre ashamed. And since they can‚Äôt turn the light back on, they try the next best thing. Adam and Eve perform the first religious act recorded in human history.

In Genesis 3:7 we read:¬†‚ÄúAnd they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.‚Äù

Let me make this the second consequence to their sin:¬†*Theyexperienced the frustration of self-effort.*¬†

They‚Äôve lost their brilliant splendor. They‚Äôre keenly aware of their unadorned, naked bodies, and they effectively try to cover over their guilty consciences.

This is religion‚Äôs motivation all around the world. People are sewing fig leaves together, trying to cover over their sin with good deeds, penance, church or mosque observances, temple rituals, chants, songs, long prayers, and sacraments.

Let me tell you something: fig leaves do not work! They can‚Äôt remove guilt. Religion cannot silence internal shame. And that‚Äôs because the issue isn‚Äôt so much how you sin but¬†*who*¬†you‚Äôve sinned against. Only¬†*He*¬†has the cure for shame; you have to deal with your Creator.

Third,¬†*Adam and Eve experienced the futility of trying to hide from God.*

Genesis 3:8 reads:

*And they heard the sound of the Lord¬†God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.*

Can you imagine trying to run from God? Well, people do it every day. You can run from God, but you can‚Äôt hide from God. There isn‚Äôt a tree big enough.

Verse 9 says, ‚ÄúBut the Lord God called to the man and said to him, ‚ÄòWhere are you?‚Äô‚Äù

God knew where they were; He knew what tree they were hiding behind; He knew Adam was now wearing a size 38 fig-leaf suit. He even knew how they were feeling and why they were hiding.

So why does God ask, ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù

God wants them to come to Him in open admission and honest confession. The apostle John writes, ‚ÄúIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness‚Äù (1 John 1:9).

God had warned them back in Genesis 2:17,¬†‚ÄúIn the day that you eat of it \[the forbidden fruit\] you shall surely die.‚Äù¬†And although Adam and Eve remained physically alive, they immediately died spiritually.

The apostle Paul tells us that spiritual death is now inherited by every human being since that original sin. This is part of our spoiled legacy. Paul writes in Romans 5:12:

*Just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned.‚Äù*¬†

So, we can‚Äôt just blame Adam ‚Äì we¬†*all*¬†sin, too.

Maybe you‚Äôre sitting in a coffee shop or office or at home and you‚Äôre hearing that quiet voice asking this same question: ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù¬†Where are you in relation to God? Maybe you want to run from that question and hide. Maybe you‚Äôve been trying to silence your shame and guilt through religion or good deeds.

No amount of¬†*good*¬†is¬†*good enough.*¬†That‚Äôs why that little voice you can‚Äôt turn off tells you that you‚Äôre guilty‚Äîthe shame you feel is telling you something‚Äôs not right.

Keep listening. The words you are hearing are an invitation to stop hiding and start confessing your sin to God.

Let me point out two principles from this scene here in the garden of Eden.

The first principle is this:¬†*God already knows the worst about you.*

In¬†Hebrews 4:13, the Bible says,¬†‚ÄúNo creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of \[God\].‚Äù

That verse makes a direct connection between Adam and Eve and you and me. We‚Äôre all naked and exposed. None of us can hide from Him.

The God who created space, time, and matter knows everything that‚Äôs going on everywhere, all the time, in the light and the dark. He knows every thought you‚Äôve ever had, every word you‚Äôve ever spoken, every action you will ever take‚ÄîHe knows it all, already. That means God already knows the worst about your past and your future.

But here‚Äôs the second promise we can draw from this garden scene:¬†*Even though God knows the worst about you, He will forgive you.*¬†

When all seemed lost and without hope for Adam and Eve, the Creator came walking, seeking, asking,¬†‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù¬†

Jesus said, ‚Äú\[I\] came to seek and to save the lost‚Äù (Luke 19:10). Are you lost? You‚Äôre just the person He‚Äôs looking for. He invites you to stop running, to stop hiding. Confess your sin to Him, ‚Äúfor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life‚Äù (John 3:16).

That‚Äôs part of God‚Äôs promise to Adam and Eve‚Äîthe promise of a coming Redeemer. It‚Äôs a promise given even in the garden of Eden, as we will discover in our Wisdom Journey.

**Blurb:**

The devil promises there is much to be gained by sin. However, sin always brings loss, both for us and for those around us, and no amount of self-effort can reverse that. The sad legacy of Adam and Eve offers warning to us but also the assurance that God has not given up on us.",1,1755518552.0,TheWisdomJourney,0,1.0,False

1mtjyxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mtjyxr/confronting_a_friend/,Confronting a friend,"Hello Reddit! I‚Äôm in a bit of a weird place after helping a friend move and could use some input on navigating the relationship (and boundaries moving forward). Also sorry if this gets a bit rambly!

My best (and pretty much only friend) moved over the weekend and I‚Äôm not thrilled about how mine and my sister‚Äôs efforts were treated and I‚Äôm struggling with how to move forward.

For context, I work from home permanently and my husband and I moved to a new state during COVID; I tend to have hobbies that are more individual focused so I haven‚Äôt made any new friends so this friendship feels like a bit of a lifeline for me and is the reason I‚Äôm even here to get your ideas.

Anyway, my friend is on her own and struggles with CPTSD and depression so she was not been in the best place heading into her move. I recruited my sister to help (she‚Äôs great like that) on move-in day only but she lives in the same city and even went over to help her this past week with packing a few boxes. I drove several hours Friday to be in town and ready to help the next day.

Saturday is moving day and she lets those of us helping in a group chat know when she is expecting to be back at her place with the moving truck. My sister and I had planned to arrive when the truck was there, but my friend mentions that some of the others who have agreed to help have prior commitments and they wouldn‚Äôt be able to help for the full day so sis and I show up earlier to start getting boxes organized to load on the truck. We also stopped to grab coffee and I also grabbed a breakfast sandwich for the friend moving so she had fuel for the move. 

When we arrived there were still quite a few things that hadn‚Äôt been packed (which neither of us were expecting) so my sister and I spend the next hour packing the remaining boxes before she gets back with the truck and other people show up to help.

When she gets back, the rest of us immediately started going up and down to move the boxes to the garage to be placed on the truck and I notice she‚Äôs kind of meandering back and forth in the garage and regularly was getting in the way of those of us carrying boxes. It doesn‚Äôt help that it was also INSANELY hot and humid so energy was getting spent quickly.

Once we got the truck loaded, my sister volunteered to drive it to the new place and start unloading while the rest of the caravan finished loading up our cars with the last few things. Because I don‚Äôt have prior commitments my car is the last in the caravan loaded and my friend and I head to the new place.

We arrive and it‚Äôs a little bit of the same- most of us are doing the heavy lifting and my friend is helping, but is more focused on flirting with the woman she recently started dating so she‚Äôs acting a bit giggly and isn‚Äôt too focused on getting everything moved in so she was ending up in the way again. For example 3 of us were moving her heavy couch up the stairs and had stopped at the first landing to plan the next move up because it was a tight squeeze in the stairwell and as we were getting ready to move it again my friend and her love interest came down the stairs and stopped in the stairwell to observe what we were doing; I figured she just stopped for a beat while we all were taking a minute to catch our breath and prep for the heavy lifting, but when they didn‚Äôt move I asked them to please get out of the way so we could get by.

All in all, we were able to get her finished packing and moved in within 4 hours (there were 7 of us total including my friend). After getting the last box upstairs 2 of the people had to jet pretty quickly and my friend thanked them and offered to grab them dinner as a way to thank them. My sister and I were going to clean up and chill out after the move before heading back that night for a girls night to celebrate the new place.

Before heading back over my friend mentioned she‚Äôd have the tv and internet set up for when we arrived so when we got there she hopped in the car with us to do a snack run before hanging out. While at the store my friend made a couple comments about not having money for snacks (part of the reason she moved was due to this) so without much thought I offered to buy a bag of candy. As we got to the checkout though she drifted towards the fresh flowers and picked up a $20 bouquet exclaiming they‚Äôd be perfect for the new place which made me feel gross and taken advantage of. I didn‚Äôt really know what to do/say so my sister thoughtfully pulled my friend‚Äôs candy out of my checkout pile and put it back into my friend‚Äôs so I wouldn‚Äôt pay for it. But I was just so gobsmacked I couldn‚Äôt think of anything to say that wouldn‚Äôt be humiliating. 

When we get back to the new place, I‚Äôm expecting we‚Äôd pop on a movie and eat some junk food before we‚Äôd head back to my sister‚Äôs place to sleep, but the WiFi isn‚Äôt set up yet. Once I get some drinks poured and snacks unpacked, I also work helping my friend find a vase for her flowers and try to remember where the kitchen shears were packed (the ones I didn‚Äôt expect we‚Äôd had to even think about packing so idk where they were other than being in a clearly marked kitchen box).

It‚Äôs finally time to relax but instead my sis and I end up just chilling on the couch while my friend starts setting up her WiFi; when it‚Äôs not working we offer suggestions on what could be the issue but she ignores it until she figures it out. We watch an episode of a game show before my sis and I call it a night and head home.

On the way I couldn‚Äôt help but feel taken advantage of and like both of our efforts were expected, not appreciated, and we were disregarded. I was embarrassed I subjected my sister to that and got her coffee the next morning as a thank you for giving up her Saturday to help out my friend. I spent my drive home disappointed that my friend treated my sis and efforts so poorly and frustration at myself for not addressing it- it genuinely feels like the conflicts I have with this friend are subtle so saying anything would feel like an over dramatization if that makes sense.

This is where I need help. My thoughts are that I can let it go and keep being friends, which to me feels like that I‚Äôm validating the way my sis and I were treated. Or, I don‚Äôt mention it and pull back from the friendship so I‚Äôm not subjecting myself to that kind of treatment. Or, I can call her out and let her know I felt she was rude to me and my sister during a BIG favor.

This woman has been my friend for a long time, but I haven‚Äôt been great about standing up for myself and setting boundaries - especially when the disparities are slight, it just makes me feel like I‚Äôm blowing things out of proportion. I‚Äôm even more confused because both my husband and sister expected this kind of behavior from my friend - they both think she‚Äôs high maintenance and likes playing the part of ‚Äúdamsel in distress‚Äù which I‚Äôm starting to see when reflecting back over the years of our friendship. 

So‚Ä¶ what would you do? How do I start setting boundaries so I can be happy to help without being taken advantage of? How do I have hard conversations with people without ending relationships?

Whew, if you read through that and have suggestions I truly thank you!",1,1755518326.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve just moved from Jersey to London at the start of the 2025/26 tax year (April 2025) and I‚Äôm struggling to figure out the smartest way to handle my taxes in the UK. Back in Jersey, I was a sole trader (software developer for a single US firm) and probably wasn‚Äôt as tax-efficient as I could‚Äôve been for the past few years. With UK rates hitting up to 45% plus NI, I want to tighten things up and avoid overpaying where possible.

Here‚Äôs my situation:

* I earn \~US$130k/year, paid in USD. I usually exchange my salary to GBP bi-weekly via my personal Revolut account.
* I‚Äôm renting in London, covering 60% of the rent (¬£1,400/month including bills; my partner pays the rest).
* I‚Äôve got a mortgage on a property in Jersey I‚Äôm trying to sell soon (currently paying the mortgage on top of rent) ‚Äì no clue how that affects UK taxes (e.g., CGT on sale?).
* Was a sole trader in Jersey; now wondering if I should stay that way, set up a limited company and pay myself via dividends, or explore other options.
* I work from home 90% of the time, and my work‚Äôs with one US client. Unlikely to land extra clients based on my current setup, so not sure how that impacts expensing things like (potential) client meetups, dinners, etc.
* Last year I put 10% in to a SIPP, and 10% into personal investments. Perhaps I should do more if I'm aiming at getting my rate down.

From what I‚Äôve read, a ltd company could save tax by paying myself a low salary + dividends (lower rates, no NI on divs). Sole trader seems like a simpler setup but hits me with income tax up to 45% + NI, which feels brutal on \~¬£100k (after USD conversion). My big question is what I can/should expense to cut my tax bill and how to go around doing that.

Questions:

1. Sole Trader vs Ltd Company: What‚Äôs likely the best option for me at this income level? Any tips on setting up a ltd company cheaply (e.g., via Companies House)? Pitfalls with USD income, like conversion timing or holding funds in a company? Can I keep using my personal Revolut account, or should I get a business one?
2. Expenses: What can I realistically expense to lower my tax? Rent (since I work from home 90% and pay 60% of it), home office stuff (desk, chair, laptop), internet, travel to coffeeshops/workspaces for occasional work, software subscriptions, or pension contributions? With only one client, can I expense ‚Äúclient meetups‚Äù (e.g., coffee chats) even if extra work isn‚Äôt likely? How do I track/claim expenses properly to avoid audits?
3. Dividends/Salary Mix: If I go ltd, is low salary (\~¬£12.5k for NI threshold) + dividends the way to go? Or should I take more salary for pension/State benefits? Rough idea of tax savings vs sole trader?
4. Jersey Property/Mortgage: Any tax issues with my ongoing Jersey mortgage or when I sell the property? Anything like split-year treatment to ease the transition?
5. General Tips: Best low-cost ways to get advice? Smaller accountancy firms or people who‚Äôve made a similar Jersey-to-UK move? I‚Äôd rather avoid big firms due to high fees and less personal service.

Any advice is super appreciated. Cheers!",0,1755517772.0,UKPersonalFinance,4,0.5,False

About every two to three days the port police will ask me to present a ticket within 24 hours of departure or a recent arrival if I am konked out overnight in the lounge area. 

I pay $49 a month for a Frontier airlines GOWILD pass which allows me to book essentially ""free"" stand-by flights at 12:01am the day of--or before--for a flight one-way--once i arrive at the destination (usually denver) and take the light rail to the closest 24 hour fitness--shit shower and shave--sometimes do some exploring--and then book the next day GOWILD ticket back to portland and camp out in the terminal 24 hours before departure-- fly back to portland with ticket in hand which buys me another 24 hours to ""wait for my ride"" in a very nice sleeping/lounge area--rinse and repeat. 

The go wild pass does make you pay for taxes and fees which work out to be about $12 per trip for me but I am able to get 7 days of airport lounge privileges for 3-4 trips a week. I usually keep the bulk of my clothes and possessions in a nearby storage unit in Oregon--and carry one or two changes of clothes before I come and use a pretty high end north face travel/luggage backpack- neck pillow, and eye covers. Always shower at the gym before I come out, have a high and tight haircut/good hygiene and always make sure and buy coffee from the main coffee vendor in the main terminal every morning. 

Overall I spend about $690ish a month for taxes/fees/storage unit and gym membership+cell phone+laundromat+morning coffee under this system out of a budget of $1344 I receive for SSDI - ain't the greatest ""life"" but seems to beat living in a nightly shelter in skid row. I've tried the roommate route but my autism always leads to it falling apart and I am too young (35) and technically ""able bodied"" to qualify for any section 8 housing in my local area.

Just trying to figure out if the airport staff know i've exploited sort of a loop hole bopping around airports every two days just to lodge in the terminals - i guess it's technically within the rules

I will continue to do this system as its the safest and most closely monitored public area one could sleep in with some decent amenities like 24/ 7 bathrooms, outlets, and generally professional company but am ready to be 86'd at any time once my ""con"" is exposed lol",5,1755517717.0,homeless,4,0.86,False
1mtjreh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1mtjreh/my_sister_is_a_gift_snob_and_i_just_hate_her_for/,My Sister Is a Gift Snob and I Just Hate Her for It,"Not an AITA, not a WIBTA... I'm just venting.

  
My sister and I, both in our 30s, grew up in the same house with the same parents, though there are certain differences in how we were raised. She was the older golden child, I'm the held-back-a-year-maybe-black-sheep child.  All I'm saying is we grew up having similar economic environments, sans the obvious she gets new stuff while I get hand-me-downs.  She was given her first phone, I bought my own using cash I saved up from gifts and little jobs. But we were both picked up from school by dad's ""embarrassing"" work truck and got packed lunches when our friends had money to buy food instead. You know how it is when we were younger.

So, 2025. She has a fancy job and got married with 2 kids, my single-by-choice butt has a 9 to 5 (it is admittedly boring, but it pays the bills). 

Now, it isn't really hard to guess that I don't have that much disposable income. I do like to treat myself, but I'd argue that it's my money to spend on myself, which I don't often grant. My recent ""big"" purchase was a walking pad and previously a new pair of headphones. Here's the thing, though. I don't really like spending my money on things that I know would be a waste. What I consider would be a waste of money is trying to match the price tag for her and (most of all) kids' gifts.

My sister (I mean, good for her) married rich. Her friends also married into well-to-do families. You know that clique in high school? Yeah, them. So, year after year, occasion after occasion, my small gifts don't hold a candle to the often extravagant gifts they get for my sister and her family. Here's the list of 'events' she's held for her own family. I repeat, her OWN family. She throws a party, invites everyone, hence the need for gifts. 

Mother's Day (yes, I know), Father's Day (again, I know), Her Birthday, Husband's Birthday, kid 2's christening, kid 1's Birthday, kid 2's birthday, Christmas x 4, \[insert culture specific holiday here so I don't give away too many details\] x 4. That's FIFTEEN SEPARATE GIFTS last year. 

There used to be a worse time when my sister was dating her current husband. All up to like her second year of marriage, she'd police my gifts for her husband, always saying he doesn't like this or that. It was always some expensive shirt or a wallet or something she had on an Amazon wishlist. At the time and to this day, I still think she was choosing branded items because she was embarrassed of any other gift I might give. This has always bothered me because she knows how I live, how we lived growing up, and that I am more mindful when it comes to spending. 

One time I just didn't listen to my sister and got him a bag of coffee from somewhere I visited. It was small, I know, but it was what I could afford and what was willing to spend at the time because all my previous sister-policed gifts were MIA. No courtesy one-time wearing to pretend he like the gift, nothing. But he ended up liking the coffee! He ended up having bags shipped for his morning coffees - which, I mean, I guess that shows me he LIKED it, right? That's what I tell myself, at least.

For her, I cling on to whatever bits and bobs she tells me.  It's hard because it feels VERY transactional and no gift will be worthy until it's a fancy brand. So, if she likes How I met Your Mother, the color pink, and a specific hot sauce? I get her a yellow umbrella, a pink sling for her yeti tumbler, and 2 bottles of that hot sauce and put it in a paper bag. Boom. Birthday gift. But it's gotten to a point where 1. she's dropping hints that she doesn't collect doodads anymore (which, okay), 2. I see her dog walker using the gifts I gave her, obviously regifted (yes, that pink sling), 3. she's outright asking me ""are you still thinking of what to get me?"" and then send me a link to a cartier band (I think she sent me this to hint at more expensive gifts rather than the getting her the band itself). I mean, regifting's fair and all but there's this little part of me that thinks she's intentionally done this to that person for me to physically see that my gifts have been regifted. You know, as a ""take this as a hint"" kind of deal. I'm friends with her dog walker btw. 

The WORST of it are the gifts for her kids. In the span from their birthday to Christmas, they've gone from liking hot wheels, to Pok√©mon cards, to Legos. Yes, I know that's how kids are, which is why I'm not willing to spend a lot of money on a Hot Wheel set just to see it forgotten the next month. I don't have Lego money. At least with Pok√©mon, I thought I could stock up on packs when they went on sale (that's what I did), but they said that they don't like the packs and the want the Charizard like something Logan Paul has. Guys, when they asked me for Ninja's mouse before, I thought sure? It's a damn mouse. It was $100. Do you know how wild it is to see your small mouse-containing box (one already way out of your budget) beside a rideable toy car that no one bothered to wrap because it was too big? It's insane. Oh, if anyone's wondering what happened to the Pok√©mon cards, if you guessed that they regifted it as gifts to their housekeeper's children after their own kids ripped open the said packs and took the 'good' cards, you'd be correct!

Just to give you guys an idea on what I planned to give instead of the imposed gifts. The Hot Wheels set was supposed to be tickets to see Monster Jam. I know I'm not getting them the best seats, but decent enough. It was either a small Lego set or a kick scooter. All vetoed and got the ninja mouse instead. I did not and will not get them a Charizard. I just gave them the packs and you all know how *grateful* they were. You know how it feels to put some thought into a gift, gone. I just wish I was *allowed* to give the gifts I wanted to somehow give me an idea on how I can meet them in the middle. They're young. They're going to forget my awful gifts now. If they didn't like Monster Jam, I can be like okay. Sure. It's different with kids.

So, this year, I started NOT caring anymore. That BMW bike? I got them the cheapest one on Amazon and slapped a bow on it. For her birthday, I cooked a huge thing of lasagna and garlic bread and dropped it off at her house (I'm actually thinking of making celebratory lasagnas my ""thing""). For the husbands birthday, two pairs of shorts. The other kids? I baked them a cake (yes, they still had a giant-ass cake but IDC anymore). 

I used to spend at least 5 to 10% of my monthly salary for just ONE gift and used to care if they liked it or not - because she had somehow hinted that those were the preferred gifts. I also used to be fine with spending more money for my sister's gifts. Not anymore. After the failed Lululemon Belt Bag, 5-minute book shopping spree, Birkenstock Clogs, and tickets for two at a Princess and Frog themed dinner - no more! Now, I'm gifting more within my means. Also, I'm able to get people I like better gifts because I'm not trying to match the price tags of the gifts my sister and her family can easily get from other members. 

I'd also like to share a little victory. The dog-walker friend I mentioned asked where I bought the shorts. Apparently, the husband bought similar pairs in different colors because he was wearing them around the house so much. I just remembered him saying one time that shorts are too 'short"" and he preferred them longer and more breathable. I got him those ultra stretch shorts from Uniqlo - the longer 8.5 length ones. 

I really think my sister got into the heads of her kids and plagued them with all this, I want to say, entitlement. I think my sister is too in to that high society life now that she forgets that other people can't live and spend money the way that she does. Anyway, rant over. Thanks for reading.

PS. I also don't want to marry rich or marry at all. The goal is to buy a farm and live the rest of my life with the many animals I hope to get. Cows!",3,1755517705.0,TwoHotTakes,8,1.0,False

1mtjpn7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mtjpn7,Showing off some of the decks I'm playing rn,"* **Tim Hortons**: Generic midrange CT list that kinda abuses some stuff exclusive to him. You could probably play something similar on other Kabloom heroes and get better results, but being able to run this kind of deck on CC is honestly really fresh. Name is a silly joke; midrange espresso = mid coffee
* **Brose**: Funny Bean Counter list that isn't on Carrotina for once. Premise is to use Bean Counter a bit slower than usual to reap the sustain and tempo it's able to provide. Cool Bean is kinda iffy, but Mistake doesn't seem necessary here and this deck needed another 3-drop anyway. Sun-Shroom can be swapped with Primal SF for tech purposes, but both cards are wanted here to bait removal or otherwise ramp to your combos
* **Everest Control**: An update to [Mop Maximus](https://www.reddit.com/r/PvZHeroes/comments/1btetk4/mop_maximus_a_guide_to_some_crummy_neptuna_garg/), which was an old joke deck I made. Basic premise is still the same, but we're running harder control and more top-end. Mainly since Excavator usability has gone downhill due to plant buffs, along with Wannabe now being ~~playable~~ synergetic with Gargolith. Ice Pirate can be swapped with Gargoligist if you want it here, but I've explained before that it doesn't do much and Ice Pirate is more synergetic with this deck's goals. Name change is to reflect the lack of mop synergies taking place here
* **Combo AGraves**: An updated list to an SB budget deck I actually shared on the ""best decks"" post. Only change is Surprise Garg being replaced with Vendor, who's a lot more applicable to this deck and generally is a staple budget card on SB. It was previously ran since it played into the gimmick of this deck being incredibly cheap and made from SB's hero quest cards, but Surprise Garg sucked enough here that it wasn't even worth using for free. Still not ready to add it to the post, as I'm not 100% sure on the ratios and Vendor might not be ideal here, but I'm pretty happy with it so far
* **Ladder SP**: Modded Radiotherapy list that I made specifically for playing on ladder. The deck is sped up with the inclusion of Raptors and burst damage options, which can bully some of the overly slow decks people love to run. I'm also running 4x Fireweed here since that card is goated. It all seems stupid and it kind of is, but running this so far has felt better
* **Pet Control**: NOT OPTIMIZED FOR LADDER. I run this in 2k tournaments since the decks there have worse scaling and don't run environments as often. I'm basically just removing what they play while reaping value from Cosmic Yeti and eventually overwhelming them in the late game. No real top-end since Zoo and Cosmic kinda cover that and top-end options on a budget suck anyway ~~Also I hate Starch Lord now this tournament has radicalized me I want to strangle the person at PopCap who thought letting a value engine snowball was a good idea~~
* **Dino Counter**: If you know anything about me, it's that I love this deck. This is the latest version and probably the one I'll run until the next update, whenever that comes. Previous version had worse ratios and ran Jumping Bean, which got ironed out after some help from some friends on Discord. If you've never seen this deck before, you're basically just playing greedy and making wide boards, with Trica + Bean Counter and ANB + Bean Counter being your main combos, and eventually pay off everything with bouncing and Brainana

I am looking for a girl, 20-25, preferably from Eastern Europe, Christian Orthodox, which would want a long term relationship and eventually tie the lace into something permanent. It would be good if you are a family oriented person, and want to establish one.

I want to find a woman to make a nice home and life for, give her nice things, dresses and trinkets, take her to the nicest places this area has to offer, and live with in a very close intimacy.


About me:

I have recently turned 25, I have a stable job, finished university, and I am working on renovating my own cottage in a rural area, in which I plan to live, hopefully with the right woman.

I am white, brown hair and brown eyes, 1.75cm tall, good physique and normal weight. I can say that I am looking decent and I take good care of myself, my looks, my outfits, my diet, etc. I wear mostly button up shirts. I take good care of my teeth.

I like homemaking, classic literature, the cottage core aesthetic, natural fabrics and clothing, arts and crafts, some of which I practice. I do not watch many movies or listen to music too often, but I am open to the idea, I always try to find new things to enjoy.

Some of my hobbies include collecting antiques of all sorts, old quality furniture and silverware, fishing, walking around fields and hills. Very often I spend my afternoons on my back porch or in my yard, I like to enjoy the silence, the air and the sky.

I sometimes travel to old manors and castles in my area, I like old towns and cold/rainy places, I am more of a mountains type of person than a beach type. I travel sometimes, but not more than once per year out of the country. I like to stay close to home.

I own a Saxon style home which I have been working on for a couple of years, and soon as I finish settling into my cottage, (which will be by the end of this year), I want to start practicing small scale agriculture (for vegetable and animal produce), which I have previous experience in. I must mention I have saved up a modest dowry as well.

I do not drink alcohol daily, I do not smoke cigarettes or take any drugs. I smoke a briar pipe and sometimes cigar, and drink coffee and tea. I use social media rarely and did not play video games for a very long time. I wake up early in the morning, I am not a night owl.

I have a number of good friends I meet throughout the year, and I go to some events, but I prefer to keep to myself and my close family, I am social but I limit my interactions. 

I am not interested in current politics, but considering my lifestyle and religion, I am slightly conservative, although I am not restrictive or shut off from life and the way it is, after all I am not breaking away from society.

I have flaws, and I am not perfect in any way, but I live and learn, and I do not have an attitude of superiority.





Important things to consider:


I am looking for someone that is accustomed to a dull but pretty rural life, that doesn't use social media too often, and would rather spend her free time outside rather than on the phone.

It is not a problem if you don't have a degree, as long as you like to read and learn new things, or skills. 

It would be good if you would have experience in homemaking, meal prepping, canning, etc.

I have no physical criteria as long as you take good care of your health, diet and teeth.

The only strict criteria I have is to be someone that wants to make a commitment and approach this in a serious manner, I am not looking for something temporary. 




If you want to talk, just introduce yourself and we can share pictures after a brief conversation.


Thank you for your time!

We started as a Polish SEO/SEM agency. Over time, we built a tool for ourselves that ended up changing our entire business. Since I keep getting asked *‚ÄúIs growAp a SaaS? Is it still an agency? Can it work for others?‚Äù*, I thought I‚Äôd share the full story here.

# Background

We built growAp as an internal tool. We were running an SEO/SEM agency, serving clients with dozens of locations (retail, clinics, finance, insurance, etc.). Managing Google Business Profiles and other local listings was a nightmare: manual updates, mistakes, lack of consistency, hundreds of wasted hours.

In 2022, we wrote the first version of the app (originally just a simple review management script), which:

* centralizes Google Business Profile management,
* automatically overwrites data,
* integrates alerts, handles reviews, manages reputation,
* works as a B2B white-label platform for agencies.

# Team ‚Äì 7 years of single listings before building real structure

Before growAp, we spent 7 years as an agency manually handling single listings. Literally: opening Google, changing hours, updating photos, replying to reviews, fixing map issues, removing duplicates. All by hand, client by client.

The one thing we knew: if we ever automate this, we need to know every dirty detail of the process.

Building a team that can handle this at scale took us‚Ä¶ years. Today, we have around 10 people working full-time verifying local data, monitoring errors, reporting issues, analyzing duplicates and reviews. Some of them came from the original agency team, others joined later as ‚ÄúgrowAp support.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt build a team overnight-because you can‚Äôt design a process you haven‚Äôt gone through yourself. But once you know it inside out, you can hire people and teach them not only *how* to click, but *why*.

# How we got clients

There was no single magic channel. Over the years we tested different approaches, and only later it started becoming predictable. Some worked great, others looked good only on paper. Here‚Äôs what actually brought clients:

* **SEO** ‚Äì classic. As an agency we had processes and know-how, so we started generating leads organically for terms like ‚ÄúGoogle Business Profile management‚Äù or ‚ÄúGoogle Profile for multi-location networks.‚Äù Many companies came in already educated.
* **Referrals** ‚Äì nothing for a while, then everything at once. Happy clients brought in their colleagues, managers, PMs, or someone who ‚Äúsaw a presentation at a partner company and wanted the same.‚Äù
* **Trade shows & conferences** ‚Äì especially retail and franchising events. Sometimes a 7-minute coffee chat turned into a rollout for 300+ locations.
* **LinkedIn‚Ä¶ spam** ‚Äì yes, we did cold outreach on LinkedIn. And‚Ä¶ it worked. But honestly, I don‚Äôt recommend it. After 1,000 messages with personalization and automation, maybe you land one decent client-but the effort is massive. Sometimes posting once a week would‚Äôve been easier.
* **Cold email** ‚Äì same story. We ran campaigns to specific networks, pointing out real Google Maps errors with suggestions and solutions. CTRs were good, conversions acceptable. But it‚Äôs a starting tool, not a scaling tool. Easy to burn through your database. We also learned that marketing managers aren‚Äôt always the best target.
* **Partnerships with other agencies** ‚Äì the real gamechanger. SEO and marketing agencies started offering growAp as their own (white-label), while we focused on support and training. This generates the most new clients today and the highest value per account.

# What changed in our company

* We hired a dedicated product team for app development
* We separated agency operations from tech operations
* We started onboarding other agencies to growAp (white-label)
* We introduced revenue-share structures with partners
* We stopped outbound entirely ‚Äì 100% of clients now come from inbound and referrals

# If I had to give advice‚Ä¶

1. Build a tool for yourself first. If it works, then think who else it might help.
2. Measure everything. That‚Äôs how we knew growAp was making a difference-before clients even realized.
3. Don‚Äôt try to be ‚ÄúSaaS.‚Äù Solve a specific problem. In our case: chaos with 100+ listings.
4. Your ops team must be able to handle it. Without processes and training, it‚Äôs just another dashboard.

# We have the processes. And we‚Äôre ready to share them.

After all the tests, mistakes, and iterations, we now have fully developed and proven processes for:

* onboarding clients with 10, 50, or 300+ locations,
* structuring a team so you don‚Äôt drown in support tickets,
* creating an offer that doesn‚Äôt need 3 slides of explanation,
* ensuring scalability and quality- even with 1,000 listings in the system.

If you‚Äôre building something similar - an agency, a B2B product, or a local SaaS-feel free to reach out.  
If you have questions-technical, operational, pricing, or about the team-ask away.

Running an agency with local clients? Maybe you‚Äôre two years behind where we are now-I‚Äôd be happy to talk if you‚Äôve got a concrete challenge to solve.

1mtjmtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/RimworldArt/comments/1mtjmtx/my_top_5_iptv_providers_in_2025_after_too_many/,My Top 5 IPTV Providers in 2025 (After Too Many Late-Night Trials),"If you ever get the urge to compare **iptv providers** at 2am after a few too many cups of coffee, just know you‚Äôre not alone. I‚Äôve spent the last few months hopping between services, trying every **iptv free trial reddit 2025** could throw at me, and making notes like a very unqualified scientist. Here‚Äôs my honest ranking‚Äîno hype, just what actually happened on my screens.

* * *

### 1\. [**IPTVMEEZZY**](https://iptvmeezzy.com/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (cheaper on longer iptv subscription)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (the occasional hiccup, but even my morning news streams survived)
    
*   **My notes:** Ended up here after a friend mentioned their **iptv reseller** deal. Setup was painless, and the channel list is almost intimidating‚Äîthere‚Äôs stuff for everyone, from Premier League to old cartoons. Only once or twice did I need to refresh for a laggy stream. So far, the least amount of troubleshooting on my end.
    

* * *

### 2\. [**RocketStream**](https://RocketStream.com)

*   **Price:** $15/month
    
*   **Channels:** 37,000 live, 120,000 VOD
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (smooth on most days, but lagged during big sports events)
    
*   **My notes:** RocketStream‚Äôs interface is friendly, and their support actually got back to me within a day. VOD is decent, though I had to dig for some newer releases. I liked that they offer an **iptv free trial**‚Äîit saved me from an instant commitment.
    

* * *

### 3\. [**FlowCast TV**](https://medium.com/p/7153a0b718b8)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000 live, 105,000 VOD
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (good for movies, but live news sometimes froze)
    
*   **My notes:** I tried FlowCast after seeing a random thread about their **iptv reseller** deals. Their subscription plans are flexible, which helps if you‚Äôre indecisive like me. The main downside was a few channels going offline at weird hours.
    

* * *

### 4\. **NeonPlay IPTV**

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 27,000 live, 82,000 VOD
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (some buffering, mainly on international channels)
    
*   **My notes:** NeonPlay is straightforward‚Äînothing flashy, but I liked their guide layout. I lost my favorite cooking channel for a weekend, but streams bounced back after a reset. Not my main, but solid as a backup.
    

* * *

### 5\. [**CloudNova Live**](https://iptvmeezzy.blogspot.com/2025/08/premier-league-2025-your-ultimate-iptv.html)

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 20,000 live, 54,000 VOD
    
*   **Smoothness:** 6.5/10 (buffered a lot during primetime, VOD was OK for older shows)
    
*   **My notes:** CloudNova is definitely entry-level. It‚Äôs fine if you just need background TV, but I wouldn‚Äôt count on it for big live events. Their **iptv subscription** page is easy to use, but I found myself channel-hopping a lot just to find a smooth stream.
    

* * *

[My IPTV](https://iptvmeezzy.com/) Thoughts in 2025
---------------------------------------------------

After all these trials, a few things became clear:

*   **Free trials are your friend**‚Äîalways test before you commit.
    
*   Even the [**best iptv providers**](https://iptvmeezzy.com/) will have the occasional hiccup, so don‚Äôt stress over a rare glitch.
    
*   Don‚Äôt get distracted by huge channel numbers‚Äîfocus on what you actually watch.
    
*   If you‚Äôre curious about the **iptv reseller** world, start small‚Äîmanaging support is no joke!
    
*   Finally, always use a VPN. Better safe than sorry.",0,1755517320.0,RimworldArt,0,0.5,False

1mtjmnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MyLittleLoveHrt/comments/1mtjmnd/what_to_put_in_a_new_baby_hamper/,What to put in a New Baby Hamper,"If you are looking for baby hamper ideas you have come to the right place. Here you will find some¬†[pre-made baby hampers](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/baby-gifts/)¬†and some ideas for¬†[building your own](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/baby-gifts/build-your-own/)***.***¬†Also we have compiled suggestions on what to include below.

# Contents of a New Baby¬†Hamper

Here are some suggestions on what to include in a new baby hamper. These include;

# Clothing

* Beanies‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThere is nothing as cute as a baby beanie! They are a cute addition to many gift sets and are a practical item to keep the baby‚Äôs head warm.
* Onesies‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA¬†[onesie](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/newborn-onesie/)¬†is a suitable stand-alone gift or you could add it to any type of baby hamper.
* Hair Accessories‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIf you are compiling a¬†[girls baby hamper](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/baby-gifts/baby-girl-gifts/)¬†then adding a newborn bow or a¬†[newborn headband](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/baby-headbands/)¬†is a great thought.

# Swaddles and¬†Blankets

* Swaddle‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäOne of the most practical and versatile items a baby will use is a¬†[baby swaddle](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/perth-swaddles/).

# Toys

* Comforter‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäNot only cute, a¬†[comforter toy](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/comforter-toys/)¬†is a great little gift for a little baby.

# Baby Care Essentials

* Nappy Rash Cream‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA product that will be used for many years is nappy rash cream. Adding a small tub of this would be perfect.
* Nail Scissors‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA small grooming kit or nail scissors are a great little gift to include in any hamper for babies.
* Washcloths‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA¬†[baby washcloth](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product/baby-washcloths/)¬†is a simple but practical item that is a great idea for any baby hamper. It will be used daily and the parents will be forever grateful.
* Wipes‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäNew parents will go through mountains of baby wipes. So this makes a good idea for any hamper.
* Hair Brush Set‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäOne¬†[product people forget](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/most-forgotten-baby-shower-gifts-no-one-thinks-of/)¬†about is a¬†[hair brush set](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product/wooden-baby-brush-and-comb-set/). These are a practical item that will be used daily.
* Nipple Cream‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWhen breastfeeding nipples can get extremely¬†[cracked and sore](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/breastfeeding-problems/sore-nipples/)¬†therefore including some of this in a new mum hamper is ideal.
* Baby Soaps‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAnother item that will be used daily. Soaps for the babies‚Äô baths are a practical idea that is never thought of.
* Teether‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWhen the parents‚Äô baby starts to teeth they will be grateful that you included a¬†[teether](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/teething-toys/)¬†in the hamper.

# Feeding Supplies

* Bibs‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäOne of the most practical items you can give is a¬†[bib](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/newborn-bibs/). These are used regularly and are a great idea to include in any hamper for babies.
* Burp Cloths‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIdeal for a¬†[newborn gift](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/newborn-baby-gifts/), burping cloths are used to keep the baby‚Äôs and parents‚Äô clothes clean and dry from spit-ups.
* Feeding Accessories‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBy the time the new baby is born, the older siblings may be learning how to feed themselves. So giving them their own¬†[feed accessories](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-tag/baby-feeding-accessories/)¬†or¬†[feeding bib](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/feeding-bibs/)¬†would be a great inclusion to any hamper.

# Personalisation

* Newborn Books‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA black and white newborn book is perfect for new parents to build a bond with their baby.

# Gifts for¬†Parents

# Ideas for new¬†mum

You could make a new mum hamper or alternatively you could add some of these items into the baby hamper to compile a¬†[baby and mum hamper](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/baby-gifts/mum-and-bub/). For Mum you could include;

* Bath Salts‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäGive her the perfect gift for her to use on herself. Bath salts will give the new mum a reason to enjoy a long bath.
* Candles‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe new parents‚Äô house may be chaotic after the baby has been born. But gifting a crystal candle will at least mean it smells nice.
* Mocktail‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThese non-alcoholic drinks will let the new mum wind down after a hectic day without adding any alcohol to their body and breast milk.
* Reusable Breast Pads‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA pair of¬†[soft reusable nursing pads](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/reusable-breast-pads/)¬†are a great idea for all new mums. They will keep them comfortable while protecting their clothes.
* Journal‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBeing a new parent can be lonely so adding a journal to their hamper can be a great gift for a new mum. They also can be kept as a wonderful keepsake later in life.

It is quite common to add some ideas for mums into the baby hampers. But people forget about the dad, so here are some ideas for him.

# Ideas for New¬†Dad

Below we have included some ideas to add to a baby hamper for dads. These could be a stand-alone gift, a new dad hamper or include some of them into the mum and baby hamper.

* Bottle of scotch‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA bottle of small scotch could be added to an existing hamper or you could gift a large one as a single present.
* Bag of good coffee or coffee gift card‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäNew mums and dads live off coffee for the first few months, so adding some coffee beans or coffee gift cards would be appreciated.
* Pair of Slippers‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA comfortable pair of slippers is a great idea and will be used regularly when trying to get the baby back to sleep in the middle of the night.
* Thermos or Insulated Coffee Cup‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContinuing on with the coffee idea, a thermos or insulated coffee mug would be a great gift. This way there is a chance he will be able to drink his coffee before it gets cold.
* Bluetooth Headphones‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSome noise-cancelling or Bluetooth headphones would be perfect. This will make trying to put the baby back to sleep in the middle of the night a little less painful.
* Matching Sporting Jerseys‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIf he has a favourite sporting team get him a jersey with his and the new baby‚Äôs name on it.
* Picture of him holding his baby for the first time‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIf you are giving the hamper after the baby is born, giving him a framed photo of him holding the baby for the first time would be priceless.
* Massage Voucher‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe new dad would appreciate some alone time and enjoy some self-care for himself. So a massage voucher is a great thought for adding to a hamper.

Dads miss out on receiving gifs to celebrate the birth so including them helps them feel part of the family. And older brothers and sisters can also feel left out so we suggest including them with some of the below gifts.

# Types of Baby¬†Hampers

Below we have outlined some of the milestones, occasions, and types of baby hampers you may wish to celebrate with.

* **Pregnancy**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFinding out that a friend or family member is pregnant is the perfect time to give a little something that will help them along their pregnancy journey. We have a range of pregnancy gift hampers perfect for showing your love to the expectant couple.
* **Gender Reveal**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMany couples love to share the excitement of finding out the gender of their baby with a gender reveal party. And if you have been invited to the festivities we recommend bringing one of our¬†[gender reveal hampers](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/baby-gifts/gender-reveal-gifts/). These are all gender-neutral which is ideal for a gender reveal party.
* **Baby Shower**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäOne of the most popular celebrations for expectant couples is the baby shower. This gathering takes place at¬†[4 to 6 weeks](https://www.parents.com/baby/shower/planning-a-baby-shower/a-quick-etiquette-guide-to-baby-celebrations/)¬†before the mum is due to give birth. It is one of the last chances for the expectant mums, and sometimes dads, to see all their closest friends and loved ones in one place. There is normally an abundance of games, decorations, drinks and food. And although it‚Äôs not compulsory, it is common for guests to bring a baby shower hamper or gift. We offer a large selection that is beautifully presented and well-received. And if you have been asked to help on the day we have compiled several baby shower resources to assist.
* **Maternity Leave**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAnother reason to give a baby hamper is for someone who‚Äôs going on maternity leave. This is the perfect time for companies and work colleagues to give a gift to show how much they are appreciated and will be missed. We offer many¬†[maternity leave hampers](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/maternity-leave-gifts/)¬†and¬†[corporate baby hampers](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/corporate-baby-gifts/)¬†that are ideal for this occasion.
* **Birth**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe biggest occasion of them all is the birth of the baby. And this is the perfect time to celebrate with gifting a¬†[newborn hamper](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/newborn-hamper/)***.***¬†We ensure that our gift sets are full of high-quality, stylish and practical products that new parents want to receive! We offer a variety of different configurations and price points so you can choose which best suits your style and budget.
* **First Birthday**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe final milestone we cater for is the first birthday. The¬†[1st Birthday hampers](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/baby-gifts/first-birthday-gifts/)¬†are specifically designed for babies who are about to turn one. By their first birthday, they have grown out of many of the products in our other sets. So the 1st birthday gift sets are the perfect present for celebrating this major milestone.
* **Girls**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWe have a range of hampers for baby girls that include prints like blossoms, daisies, snugglepots and hearts designs. These are made up of different configurations and some include hair accessories.
* **Boys**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäOur range of¬†[baby boy gift sets](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/baby-gifts/boy/)¬†includes clouds, dog, nautical, lions and dinosaur prints.
* **Unisex**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIncluded in our¬†[gender-neutral hampers](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/baby-gifts/unisex-baby-gifts/)¬†are the safari, rainbow, rabbit, farm, and hearts prints.
* **Australiana**¬†\-Some if our other unisex designs include our popular¬†[Australiana hampers](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/australiana-themed-baby-gifts/)¬†which comprise a selection of koala and kangaroo-themed sets.
* **Dog-Themed**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWe also cater to those who have fur babies and are dog lovers. The dog-themed hampers are a site and stylish addition to the family.
* **Rainbow**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMany couples are having a¬†[rainbow baby](https://www.parents.com/baby/what-it-means-to-be-a-rainbow-baby-and-why-rainbow-babies-are-beautiful/), so gifting a rainbow-themed hamper would be suitable for this occasion.
* **Handmade**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäGifting something that has been made by hand means you will be giving a¬†[unique and thoughtful present](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/unique-baby-gifts/). Each one of the products in these¬†[handmade hampers](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/handmade-baby-gifts/)¬†has been made by myself.
* **Organic**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWe pride ourselves on using eco-friendly materials in most of our products. And if you care for the environment like we do we have a range of¬†[eco-friendly baby hampers](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/organic-baby-hampers/)¬†that are sustainable and organic.
* **Twins**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFor those who are buying a¬†[twin baby hamper](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/baby-gifts/twin-baby-gifts/)¬†we have a selection suitable for a boy, girl or unisex designs.
* **Mum and Baby**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäOne of the most popular hampers we offer is the baby and mum hamper. This has some items for the bub as well as items to spoil the mum.

Drinking 4 cups of tea with sugar to completely no sugar tea. I take sugar in fruits. I still get sugar cravings but its better. I have a sweet tooth, it really did test my patience. 
Completely stopped, drinking coffee and soft drinks. No junk food. No candies and chocolates. checking labels for added sugars. Mostly my sugar intake was from fruits and vegetables. 

Helped with my fitness journey, better sleep, significantly less anxiety and more calm (which was a major concern), my skin feels better and above all I personally feel better.

When it comes to small spaces, every square foot matters. The secret to making a small space appear larger and more practical. It isn't with the amount you pay for your home; instead, it is in smart design.

It doesn't matter if you live in a studio, a comfortable home, or are simply looking to improve the function of a small corner. These tips for budget-conscious homes will allow you to transform your space. These ideas help you make your place into a chic and relaxing home.

Moreover, these budget-free [**Interior Design Ideas**](https://jsrdevelopers.info/) are for the home and office. If you consider these points, you will save money. This is not only budget-friendly but also enhances your spaces with a modern look like luxury places.

# 10 Budget-Friendly Interior Design

# 1. Maximize Vertical Space

In smaller spaces, there is a small floor, so think vertically. Tall bookshelves, wall racks, vertical plant holders and wall-mounted storage units. These are all great ways to make floor space more spacious and create the illusion of height. The use of tall furniture draws the eyes upwards and makes the space appear larger.

# 2. Use Multi-Functional Furniture

Consider buying pieces that have multiple purposes. An ottoman for storage can serve as a table for coffee and a storage space for magazines or throws. A sofa bed that folds down transforms your living room into a bedroom for guests. Pick a bed that has drawers beneath or a table with sides that can be collapsed. These simple switches increase space while not sacrificing the style.

# 3. Choose Light Colours and Reflective Surfaces

The lighter shades of whites, creams and pastels make a space feel more spacious and airy. Include glasses or mirrors to reflect the light. It creates an impression of being more spacious. The glossy finishes on cabinets or tiles can also reflect light throughout the room. This is increasing the room's brightness and a sense of spaciousness.

# 4. Create Zones With Rugs and Layouts

Even in smaller spaces, making ""zones"" helps maintain structure and flow. Rugs can be used to divide the living area from the dining room or a reading space from your bedroom. These interior design ideas could be very helpful to make places luxurious. Explore layout arrangements to create cosy spaces without the need for walls.

# 5. Declutter and Go Minimal

Less is more, particularly in smaller areas. Make sure to stick to the essentials and get rid of visual clutter. Opt for shelves that are open with well-organised items. And closed storage to store things that aren't appealing. The minimalist design is not neat, but it also eases stress and enhances effectiveness.

# 6. Add Floating Shelves and Wall Hooks

If your floor space is a problem, walls can become your most trusted wall. They can be a great storage solution without consuming valuable space. Wall hooks are ideal to hang bags, coats and kitchen equipment, or even plants. Make use of pegboards in the kitchen or study to provide stylish storage solutions.

# 7. Bring In Natural Elements

Small spaces don't mean that you can't miss out on the warmth and charm. Make use of indoor plants, natural wood tones or furniture. This is all made of cane to create an element of texture and bring nature inside. Small vertical gardens are great to add greenery without requiring floor space. These interior design ideas bring natural elements.

# 8. Use Smart Lighting Solutions

Lighting choices can be the difference between a good and a bad small area. Switch out your heavy floor lamps with ceiling or wall-mounted lights. Choose warmer LED strips for cabinets or shelves to brighten the corners. Smart lighting devices such as dimmers will allow you to alter the ambience according to the time of day.

# 9. Think Foldable and Portable

To maximise flexibility, choose furniture that folds and can be put away when not being used. Desks that are mounted on walls, drop-leaf tables and stackable chairs can be lifesavers. You'll have more space when you want it. These interior design ideas are great for entertaining or for spontaneous yoga classes.

# 10. Personalize With DIY Decor

Create a unique space without spending a penny by adding DIY elements. Repurpose old crates to make shelves or cushion covers into fashionable storage containers. These interior design ideas will not only help you save money. But also give personal touches to your living space.

# In Summary:

A small room design doesn't need to carry a large cost. With a little imagination and a thoughtful plan, it can be transformed. No matter if you're renovating your studio or maximising the space of a corner. With these ideas for budget-friendly design, you to get the most out of your space, without sacrificing the style.",2,1755517060.0,u_Nice-Rope-1086,0,1.0,False

[Vladimir Putin offers rare earth minerals deal to US](https://www.financial-world.org/news/news/financial/28704/vladimir-putin-offers-rare-earth-minerals-deal-to-us/)

https://preview.redd.it/qxpou4g6jrjf1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb4ffbaf8a63de7fb677425e3018f634b4ba7b23

In March, Putin‚Äôs investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev said that Russia and the United States had begun talks on rare earth projects in Russia. Dmitriev told the Izvestia newspaper: ‚ÄúRare earths are important areas of cooperation, and, of course, we have started discussions on various rare earth and other projects in Russia.‚Äù The statement was reported by AlJazeera.

Rare earths are used in a wide range of applications, from military equipment to consumer electronics, and China‚Äôs almost complete control over their production has forced Washington to develop its own sources of supply. The US Geological Survey estimates Russian reserves at 3.8 million tons, although Moscow claims its reserves are much higher.

According to the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources, Russia has 15 types of rare earths in its possession, totaling 28.7 million tons, as of January 2023. Even with possible overestimates, this represents a small fraction of the world‚Äôs reserves.

# US has been negotiating mineral exchange

In recent months, the US has been negotiating mineral exchange agreements for security cooperation with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ukraine, seeking to wrest control of the global supply chain from China. Analysts believe that Washington may try to do the same with Russia, which would further diversify sources of rare earth minerals and reduce dependence on China.

Dmitriev stressed that US companies have already shown interest in Russian projects and that negotiations are at an early stage. The talks come ahead of a historic summit in Anchorage, Alaska, where the leaders of the two countries will meet.

Russia has thus put its natural resources at the center of its geopolitical strategy, while the US seeks to ensure a stable supply of critical minerals that are essential for the technology and defense sectors. These negotiations could have long-term consequences for the global minerals market and international relations, especially in the context of growing competition between great powers.

[***The United States Department of Energy***](https://www.energy.gov/)¬†***commits nearly a $1 billion package for U.S. Critical Minerals Supply Chain***

# National Energy and Security Strategy

The department emphasised that critical minerals continue to be vital to energy security. Such minerals promote renewable energy development, military and complex manufacturing industries. The main emphasis of this strategy is on Lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements. According to the officials, access to such minerals provides a foundation for long-term national resilience. The announcement was among the most significant federal investments in this sphere.

# Growing Global Demand

A growing global demand has been observed in critical minerals. The International Energy Agency documented that lithium tripled between 2017 and 2022. Similarly, the demand for nickel and cobalt has also been growing consistently because of the manufacturing of electric vehicles. Advanced economies have been motivated to look at new supply chains in the global clean energy transition. DOE affirmed that the majority of the U.S. needs for key minerals are imported.

[***The key minerals in an EV Battery***](https://elements.visualcapitalist.com/the-key-minerals-in-an-ev-battery/)

# Reducing Foreign Dependence

Officials identified foreign reliance as a strategic concern. China processes more than 60 percent of rare earth elements worldwide. The United States imports nearly 80 percent of its rare earth supply from that market alone. Japan, South Korea, and European Union members have expressed similar strategic worries. The DOE stated that the initiative will reduce the exposure of American industries to external pressures.

Officials noted strong opportunities for domestic employment. The critical minerals sector has potential to create thousands of skilled jobs. New mining and processing projects could support regional economies across the United States. The DOE said it will maintain workforce training programs alongside industrial growth. Workers from coal communities may receive priority access to retraining funds.

# Environmental Safeguards

The Department stated that all projects will operate within strict environmental standards. Officials recognised that mining and extraction can cause community concerns. The agency confirmed requirements for sustainable practices and advanced waste management solutions. Environmental groups have monitored the sector closely and demanded transparent oversight. The DOE announced its commitment to balancing mineral expansion with ecological protection.

# Support from Administration

Senior government officials endorsed the program strongly. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said, ‚ÄúThis nearly $1 billion investment will strengthen U.S. energy independence.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúBy supporting domestically sourced critical materials, we create a stable foundation for clean energy manufacturing.‚Äù Officials from the White House echoed these priorities. They stressed that global competition requires timely and decisive actions.

# Long-Term Strategic Importance

Energy analysts highlighted the long-term significance of the initiative. Investments of this scale shape supply chains for decades. The global shift towards renewable energy systems will only increase demand for these resources. Economists indicated that securing mineral supply supports electric vehicles, wind turbines, and battery storage industries. Defence infrastructure also depends on access to rare and specialised materials.

# Industry Collaboration

The DOE announced plans for collaboration with the private sector. Companies will partner with research institutions and state governments. Pilot projects will demonstrate new techniques for mineral processing and recycling. Partnerships will accelerate the commercialisation of laboratory-level innovations. Officials expect significant private sector contributions alongside the federal funding package.

# Conclusion

The United States is maneuvering to secure a supply of critical minerals. Industrial resilience is becoming more and more urgent, as demonstrated by federal investment of almost a billion dollars. Making things at home, environmental protection, and employment are still major priorities. The authorities admitted that this project is a part of a long-term strategy in terms of energy and security. The shift of the Department of Energy is an indication of a firm movement towards ensuring national supply chains.

As tensions between Washington and Beijing simmer, legislators want to see the US peel its mineral supply chains away from China ‚Äî by establishing more mining and production within its own borders and helping allies do the same. That has taken on added urgency after China imposed export controls on rare earths in response to US tariffs,¬†[before relenting](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/27/business/us-china-trade-deal-agreement-signed-intl-hnk)¬†as part of a trade truce.

# The bond

Lawmakers on a key House Foreign Affairs subcommittee recently introduced legislation designed to disrupt China‚Äôs dominance of the global mineral supply by strengthening an existing program that aims to speed the creation of more diverse mineral pipelines.

The¬†[bill](https://bera.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/bera.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/minerals-security-partnership-authorization-act.pdf), introduced by Reps. Ami Bera, D-Calif., Young Kim, R-Calif., and James Moylan, Guam‚Äôs Republican congressional delegate, would put the State Department in charge of leading US participation in the Minerals Security Partnership, a Biden-era initiative that brought together 14 countries and the European Union to counter China‚Äôs mineral dominance.

If passed, the legislation aims to improve coordination between the partnership members; implement rules for countries cooperating on joint mineral projects; and create a new database for providing up-to-date information on existing projects. It would also authorize $75 million for the initiative.

China‚Äôs dominance of mineral supply chains ‚Äúthreatens the US economic and national security,‚Äù Kim, who chairs the Foreign Affairs East Asia and Pacific Subcommittee, told Semafor in an interview. ‚ÄúIt is one of the most pressing security issues facing the United States today.‚Äù

China‚Äôs dominance in this space risks supply disruptions or what officials have termed ‚Äúeconomic coercion‚Äù by Beijing, a Bera aide told Semafor.

# Know More

Kim said she‚Äôs hopeful the legislation will receive a vote on the House floor, given the bipartisan nature of the proposal. Bera is the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs East Asia and Pacific Subcommittee.

Sens. John Curtis, R-Utah, and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., have¬†[introduced](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/dem/release/senators-shaheen-curtis-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-on-critical-minerals-supply-chains)¬†companion legislation in the Senate.

Kim, who plans to hold a roundtable with industry this week on the issue, said the bill is in line with the Trump administration‚Äôs priorities, noting the president‚Äôs early¬†[executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/)¬†designed to increase domestic critical mineral production.

**‚ÄúI recognize that domestic production alone will not meet the critical mineral needs of our economy and we also need to be ready to also support the economies of our friends and allies,‚Äù she said.**

# The View From china

A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington defended Beijing‚Äôs use of export controls on minerals that have civilian and military uses.

‚ÄúChina has always attached great importance to maintaining the stability and security of the global supply chain. At the same time, imposing export controls on minerals with clear dual-use potential is consistent with international practice,‚Äù Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman, told Semafor in a statement.

‚ÄúAs a responsible major country, China fully takes into account the legitimate civilian demand for these strategic minerals from other countries. Export license applications are reviewed in accordance with laws and regulations, and compliant applications are approved accordingly,‚Äù he added, noting that Beijing opposes ‚Äúunreasonable accusations‚Äù that invoke national security.

# Why NioCorp Is More Than Just Rare Earths & Magnets!

**NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project is rapidly emerging as the most strategically significant critical mineral development in the United States, offering vertically integrated production of not just rare earth elements (REEs) for magnets, but also scandium, niobium, and titanium ‚Äî all essential to aerospace, defense, and clean energy.**¬†Unlike projects focused solely on magnet materials, NioCorp‚Äôs portfolio supports high-performance alloys for hypersonics, space systems, EV platforms, and naval technologies. Its scandium-aluminum alloys are poised to transform structural components across multiple sectors due to their strength-to-weight advantages, weldability, and fatigue life ‚Äî perfectly aligned with Ford, Stellantis, Lockheed Martin, and other innovation leaders.

**With full U.S. ownership, DFARS compliance, and a high degree of permitting maturity, NioCorp stands as a secure, domestic alternative to foreign-dominated supply chains.**¬†If its upcoming Definitive Feasibility Study (Q4 2025) and current infill drilling campaign (completing Aug 2025) confirm expected outputs, the project could supply \~150 t/year of scandium and robust volumes of niobium and titanium by 2028 ‚Äî giving the U.S. unprecedented supply security in materials critical to defense and advanced manufacturing. Niobium (for HSLA steels and superalloys) and titanium (and TiCl‚ÇÑ for ultra-pure aerospace applications) are foundational to modern military systems, jet engines, and even space-based platforms.

**NioCorp is already embedded in early-stage qualification pipelines, with samples sent to U.S. national labs, defense-linked initiatives like Project Pivot, and aerospace primes including Boeing and IBC.**¬†The company is reportedly in active discussions for government-backed offtake agreements ‚Äî including with DoD and EXIM ‚Äî and is drawing interest from strategic allies and sovereign funds, such as the UKERF and Saudi PIF. These moves position NioCorp to secure project financing by early 2026, begin construction shortly thereafter, and deliver first production by mid-2028 ‚Äî in lockstep with rising global demand for clean tech and military-grade materials.

**In short, NioCorp is not just a magnet play ‚Äî it‚Äôs the leading U.S.-based, multi-mineral supplier capable of reshaping strategic supply chains from the ground up.**¬†As geopolitical tensions rise and industrial policies shift toward resilience and traceability, NioCorp‚Äôs integrated model offers a compelling solution: domestic critical mineral production, full compliance, diversified output, and near-term scalability. If execution matches trajectory,

**NioCorp will be indispensable to the U.S. industrial base and a linchpin in the global race for material dominance by 2028 and beyond**.

# ‚Äî A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2028 and beyond.

# NioCorp = ""The¬†Flagship U.S. source¬†for multiple Critical Minerals!‚Äù

# For those Following the material News from our team at NioCorp... Please consider~

**With Phase I drilling now complete and assay results likely just weeks away, NioCorp stands at a potential turning point ‚Äî the upcoming data could confirm a significant uplift in TREO and Niobium, Titanium & Scandium grades, materially enhancing the Elk Creek project's economics and strategic value.**

**""IF""these results validate expanded resources, it strengthens NioCorp‚Äôs position in ongoing offtake and EXIM financing discussions, while also elevating its status as the premier U.S.-based source for multiple critical minerals.**

**\*\*\*For investors, the next 2‚Äì3 weeks may be the last window before a material news catalyst triggers broader institutional attention and repricing ‚Äî positioning now means getting ahead of a potential value inflection point!!!**

If you‚Äôve ever watched a new SunSwap or GeckoTerminal pool explode in volume before you even had coffee, you know the pain: bots front-run every major spike, draining the best LP fees and scalps. But with the right tools and timing, you can still snipe the edge.

**Here‚Äôs the Sunrise Playbook for TRON:**

**1. GeckoTerminal‚Äôs Tron Pool Alerts:**

* Set alerts on¬†[GeckoTerminal](https://www.geckoterminal.com/tron/pools)¬†for¬†*volume triggers*¬†(e.g., $5K+ in the first 30 minutes, or sudden TX spike on any new pool).
* Watch for ‚Äú0.3% fee‚Äù configurations and pools that hit 10-20 trades within the first 10 minutes‚Äîthese signal organic interest before the bots fully boot up.

**2. SunSwap‚Äôs New Pool Feed and Analytics:**

* Check the¬†[SunSwap New Pools](https://www.geckoterminal.com/tron/sunswap-v3/pools)¬†tracker at UTC or local/Asia morning‚Äîthe window when devs and LPers try to catch western time zones napping.
* Prioritize pools where the creator is a known player (Wallet label = previous winner, SunGenX dev, or repeat top-10 LP).

**3. Volume-over-Liquidity Ratio:**

* Look for new pools with a >0.5 ratio of volume to initial liquidity in the first hour. Example: $8K traded in first $10K provided = real flow, not just wash.
* Low-ratio pools are often just fake or inside money‚Äîskip and wait.

**4. Front-Run the Front-Runners:**

* Manual method: Set a tight watchlist, and filter pools by active TX rate (not just TVL).
* Pro alpha: If you see a pool with only 1-2 LPs, but dozens of buyers/sellers (and no mega bot spikes), it‚Äôs prime for manual scalps with a smaller size.

**5. Track Smart Money**

* Use DEX tools or wallet trackers to monitor which addresses are jumping into each pool.
* If ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù repeats join 2‚Äì3 pools in different cycles, consider copycat entries on a tight leash.

**Prompt:**

It was fine‚Ä¶ but it was bland, generic, and focused on the product instead of the customer.

I rewrote it to:

‚ÄúProtect your family for less than the cost of a coffee a day‚Äù

Why I think it worked better:
	1.	Benefit Feature 
     People don‚Äôt care about ‚Äúplans,‚Äù they care about protecting loved ones.
	2.	Specific framing 
     Less than a coffee a day‚Äù makes the price feel trivial compared to the value.
	3.	Emotional hook 
The word family pulls harder than affordable.

The result: conversions went from 1.2% to 3.7% over 3 weeks with 5,000 visits per variant.

Full Water Filter Review,"The **Bluevua RO100ROPT-Lite Replacement Filter** for the Bluevua Reverse Osmosis System has become a staple in our kitchen over the past few weeks. As someone skeptical of water filter replacements‚Äîbecause some tend to compromise on quality‚ÄîI decided to test this filter thoroughly to see if it genuinely lived up to the hype. Spoiler alert: It has its strengths but also left me with a few nitpicks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the design is simple yet functional. With dimensions of 4.29""D x 4.29""W x 13.8""H and weighing 2.43 pounds, the filter feels robust without being overly bulky. Its clean cylindrical shape slid into the countertop reverse osmosis system like a glove. The material used, labeled as ""Filter,"" feels lightweight but durable, which is reassuring since it needs consistent handling during replacements. I particularly appreciate that it doesn't take up any unnecessary space under the sink, which is perfect for smaller kitchens.

**Ease of Installation**  
The installation process? An absolute breeze. One of my biggest gripes with older systems I've used is wrestling with oddly-sized filters or needing a special tool. Not the case here. In under a minute, the replacement filter was installed and working seamlessly with my Bluevua RO system. It‚Äôs worth adding that, after the initial system flush, clean water flow was immediately restored without any hiccups or leaks. Honestly, even my tech-averse coworker could figure this out without breaking a sweat.

**Performance and Filtration Efficiency**  
This is where the filter steps up its game. Promising to reduce TDS (Total Dissolved Solids), I conducted my own tests using a TDS meter. The results? Pretty impressive. My municipal water scored around 350 ppm (yikes), but post-filtration, the reading went down to single digits‚Äîaround 5 ppm. The taste of the water? Crisp and pure. There‚Äôs a distinct difference when brewing coffee or tea; beverages taste noticeably cleaner with no chemical aftertaste. For those in areas with tougher water quality, this filter really delivers.

**Advantages**  
- Effortless installation makes it accessible for all skill levels.  
- Reduces TDS effectively, producing clean and tasty water.  
- Compact dimensions allow for easy storage and handling.  

[Check Bluevua RO100ROPT-Lite price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0bhn4gh35/)

**Drawbacks**  
- Only compatible with the specific Bluevua RO system, limiting versatility.  
- The need for regular replacements might make it pricier long-term for heavy users.  

**Durability and Longevity**  
The manufacturer recommends replacing this filter every few months, depending on your water quality and usage. In my case, with regular consumption for a family of three, it looks like it‚Äôll last a solid three months. While that‚Äôs standard for most reverse osmosis filters, part of me wishes it stretched longer. On the bright side, it doesn‚Äôt seem to lose efficiency halfway through its lifespan‚Äîas confirmed by consistent TDS readings a month into use.

**User Target and Suitability**  
If you‚Äôre someone who already owns the Bluevua reverse osmosis system, this filter is a no-brainer. It‚Äôs targeted at people like me who are keen on maintaining optimal water purity without overcomplicating the maintenance process. Small households and urban families will find it particularly convenient. However, its specialization means it‚Äôs unsuitable for anyone using a different RO system, which might alienate potential users considering a more universal option.

**Other Options**  
Comparing it to similar products, like replacement filters from APEC or iSpring, the Bluevua filter holds its ground in terms of performance. APEC models, while broader in compatibility, tend to be bulkier and not as beginner-friendly during installation. On the other hand, iSpring filters are a good competitor, offering similar TDS reduction, but they seem to clog more frequently based on user reviews. If ease of use and consistent results are priorities, I‚Äôd say Bluevua‚Äôs option has the upper hand.

**Price Performance**  
For what it offers‚Äîstellar TDS reduction, seamless installation, and reliable durability‚Äîthe cost feels justified. While some budget filters are available, many fall short in terms of long-term water purification and quality. I‚Äôd categorize this option as smart spending: you get a premium product without overpaying for bells and whistles. Still, if frequent replacements feel like a burden, it‚Äôs worth looking at less intensive but less thorough filtration methods.

# Best Sofa Set Leatherette 2025: Reviews & Guide

## Key Features Analysis

The sofa sets covered in this guide offer a range of noteworthy features that contribute to their overall appeal and suitability for different needs.

The structural integrity of a sofa set relies heavily on its frame. High-quality leatherette sofa sets typically feature frames made from solid hardwood such as kiln-dried maple or engineered woods like plywood. These materials provide a stable and durable base that can withstand years of use. The joinery methods used in assembling the frame, such as mortise-and-tenon or dowel joints, also play a crucial role in ensuring long-term stability.Lesser quality frames may use softwood or stapled joints, leading to premature wear and tear.

**Upholstery Material:**

Leatherette, also known as faux leather or PU leather, is a synthetic material designed to mimic the look and feel of genuine leather. the quality of leatherette can vary significantly; higher-quality leatherette will be more resistant to scratches, stains, and fading. It should also have a realistic grain and texture that closely resembles real leather.Ideally, the leatherette should be thick enough to withstand daily use without tearing or cracking but still be pliable enough to provide a cozy seating surface. Look for features like UV resistance to ensure color longevity.

**Cushion Filling:**

The comfort of a sofa set largely depends on the type and quality of cushion filling used. High-density foam is a common and reliable choice, offering good support and durability. Though,some sofa sets may incorporate additional materials such as memory foam or down feathers for enhanced comfort.Memory foam conforms to the body's shape, providing customized support, while down feathers offer a soft and luxurious feel. The ideal cushion filling will strike a balance between support and comfort, preventing sagging and ensuring long-term shape retention.

Addressing common questions to help you make an informed decision.

**How does leatherette compare to genuine leather in terms of breathability?**
Leatherette is generally less breathable than genuine leather. However, some modern leatherettes are designed with micro-perforations or moisture-wicking properties to improve airflow and reduce sweating. If breathability is a major concern, look for leatherette sofa sets that specifically advertise these features or consider a hybrid option that combines leatherette with natural fibers like cotton or linen.

**Can leatherette be damaged by pets?**
while leatherette is more durable than some other upholstery materials, it's not entirely immune to damage from pets. Sharp claws can scratch or puncture the surface of the leatherette, especially if it's thin or low-quality. To protect your leatherette sofa set from pets, consider using furniture covers or throws. Regularly trimming your pet's nails can also help minimize the risk of damage.**How do I clean and care for a leatherette sofa set?**
Cleaning a leatherette sofa set is typically quite simple. Regularly dust the surface with a soft cloth or vacuum with a brush attachment to remove loose dirt and debris. For spills and stains, promptly blot the affected area with a clean, damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the leatherette. For more stubborn stains, you can use a mild soap solution or a specialized leatherette cleaner. Always test any cleaning product on a small, inconspicuous area of the sofa set before applying it to the entire surface.

**What is the typical lifespan of a leatherette sofa set?**
The lifespan of a leatherette sofa set depends on several factors, including the quality of the materials, the frequency of use, and the level of care provided. With proper care and maintenance,a high-quality leatherette sofa set can last for 5-10 years or even longer.

1mtj7p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1mtj7p5/heartbroken_and_its_5_years_since_breakup/,Heartbroken and it's 5 years since breakup,"I don't know how to live like this. It's awful. I'm devastated, heartbroken, feel guilty. I get panicky where I feel like if I just reached out and said the right thing I could get him to come back even though I know that's not true and I just sob for hours.

I actually broke up with him. Everything got so messy and complicated. In some ways, he was my best friend, the love of my life, the sweetest person. In other ways, he stopped caring how I felt, at least it seemed like his actions seemed that way.

We were together for only 3-4 months when I got really sick. I was eventually diagnosed with POTS, and went to so many cardiologists and even the Mayo Clinic and was told the doctors ran out of medication to try. I was bedridden for almost our entire relationship.

He made me breakfast in bed every morning. He left me sweet notes on the fridge telling me loved me and would always hold my hand and telling me we would grow old together. He would get me flowers for no reason to cheer me up. Bought me lots of gifts for the same reason. Cooked dinner every night after work. Took me out in a wheelchair on the weekends to the mall or the bookstore or GameStop because he told me I couldn't stay inside on the weekend and get more depressed. He sat outside hospitals with me while I tried countless medications trying to feel better and was doing it outside hospitals because I was terrified of having more side effects which had happened with a lot of meds.

I was so nonfunctional, and I hated it. I got suicidal about how sick I was and he visited me every day after going to a mental hospital for feeling suicidal.

But I think he started to resent how sick I was, without directly saying it. He started liking pictures of other girls (their face or bikini photos or lingerie photos) and when I told him I thought it was disrespectful, he said I was being controlling and I wouldn't care if they weren't pretty. He messaged girls to meet him for drinks behind my back when he was flying back to London to visit his family, and didn't tell me about it. When I saw the messages and confronted him, he said they were just friends and he didn't have to tell me about it unless he actually met up with them. He messaged two of his exes, one repeatedly and the other one behind my back. His friend's father drunkenly told a story about him fighting this other guy over a girl while on a fishing trip. He denied it, said the other girl was uncomfortable and he was just sticking up for her. But he didn't tell me about it till his friend's dad told that story, and because of his other behavior, I didn't believe him. Another girl he studied with at school almost kissed him he said, and he also didn't tell me that when it happened. He told me after we almost ran into her at the grocery store. He also started telling frequently that 99.999% of guys would leave (because of me being sick). I threatened to break up with him if he kept saying that and he said he was saying it because I didn't appreciate him and still kept saying it anyways.

My dad was paying my half of costs for this time, and got tired of it and started threatening to stop sending money. My ex started applying for other jobs where my dad lived and where his parents lived in London. He finally found a pretty decent paying job where we lived, and I asked him since he found one if he could stop applying out of state, and he agreed. However, one of the jobs he applied to where my dad lived that he really wanted called him back. He interviewed for it and I even helped him prep. I asked him if I told him I didn't want to go, would he go anyways. He said yes. I didn't want to live with my dad. Both my parents were abusive growing up, in different ways. The worst part of the abuse happened in the house my dad was still living in too. My ex (bf at the time) knew this. He just kept saying nothing would happen, and we would live with my dad to save for a house and a wedding. I made up an excuse for not moving right away, and kept making up excuses to push moving out there later and later.

I was really hoping he would realize how much he missed me by being long distance and how he didn't want to live without me. Instead, it's like the distance got worse. We had an agreement that he wouldn't make female friends, just hang out with the guys till I was there. However, he started adding random girls to social media. When I asked about them, it was like oh, this girl works in a coffee shop next to my work. He started adding her friends too and when I asked about it he said oh they also used to work in the coffee shop. My cousin messaged one of the girls and she said she didn't hang out with my ex but that he had told her I was his ex girlfriend. Then he had matching water lantern festival pictures as a new girl he added on instagram. (He never put pictures of me on his instagram, it had been a big fight previously). When I confronted him about it, he said that he got the girl's number from a party that my dad took him too, and he got angry at me and said you can't help who you have a connection with. I started arguing really nasty with my ex, saying horrible things trying to hurt him as much as he hurt me. I regret it immensely. What I really wanted was him to see how much he hurt me and for him to care about me.

It was childish, but after that, I decided I was going to go hang out with whoever I wanted to also. Somehow during the year we did long distance, I also improved where I was not bedridden anymore. I'm not sure how it happened, the doctors had no idea either. So I started going to karaoke with an old friend and his friends. I started building a social circle. I said I wanted to go back to school and I didn't want to go up there and wanted to keep doing long distance. My ex agreed.

Towards the end of the year, my health deteriorated again. I went back to being bedridden for 3 months. I lost my jobs. I lost the social circle I had been building because no one wanted to come hang out in an apt with a sick girl. I called my ex. He never wanted to talk on the phone for very long and when I told him I was sick again, he just would say I would be fine and that was it.

I'm not proud of it, but I was so alone. I felt like my ex was never going to change, never stop trying to flirt with other girls. There was one guy from the karaoke group that offered to bring me soup, and started coming over to sit with me and watch tv. I felt so alone. I broke up with my ex, and immediately started dating the soup guy. I did not do anything with the soup guy until after I cut it off with my ex.

My ex and I had been together 2 months short of 6 years. He started messaging me all the time, telling me he loved me, begging me to come back. He sent me two dozen roses for Valentine's Day. I was so angry and hurt I thought I didn't care. I still kept talking to my ex though. Then he found out I had a new boyfriend and he started dating people casually. This is too long to explain, but part of my childhood, I was conditioned to care only about other people's feelings. I wanted to break up with soup guy, but when I told my mom, she kept saying how I would devastate him, and so I dated him out of guilt. For 8 months. I talked to my ex the whole time, and he still kept saying he loved me.

So I broke up with the guy of 8 months and told my ex I wanted to try again. We could go to couple's counseling, I would move up there. He then started saying he wasn't sure, he was just focusing on his job, didn't know if he wanted to be in a relationship or not. I noticed around this time, that he stopped liking other girl's photos. I was thinking maybe he was finally doing it for me and we would get back together.

That's when I found out he was dating the person he eventually married. They had been dating for a couple weeks when I found out. I called him crying and he told me he couldn't decide between her and me and that he wanted us to keep talking. I tried, but I was getting suicidal, so I would stop talking to him off and on. I wrote him a 7 page letter, with everything I said I was sorry for and how much I loved him and how I hoped he would come back to me. I called and asked him if he got it, and he just said it was nice.

I sobbed for months. I was getting better physically again, but I just stayed in bed crying for weeks. I had no friends, no family, and felt like I was losing the love of my life to someone he had not even known that long. After three months of crying in bed, and him still telling me he couldn't decide between us, I went out with the karaoke group again. I met another guy who was extremely persistent and we started dating. I still talked to my ex once in awhile. My ex still said he couldn't decide.

The new guy pushed a lot of stuff repeatedly that I told him I did not want, but he wouldn't take no for an answer and I would eventually cave. He pushed for moving in together, and I caved after a month of him asking repeatedly even though I had repeatedly said I didn't think it was a good idea. We moved in together anyways, and I blocked my ex on my phone at his request. I sometimes would unblock it to see if my ex would message me or to text him. I accidentally got pregnant. When I found out, I remember panicking thinking my ex would never come back. I contemplated having an abortion. I unblocked my ex and called him 3 times to see if he was still dating that girl.

My ex said they were exclusively dating, but she wasn't his girlfriend but that he thought about asking her. I told him I still loved him and he said he loved me too. I told him he should come back for me. He asked me if I was living with the new guy, and I lied and said no, because I was afraid of losing my ex forever. I think he knew I was lying though, I think my dad told him. I told him he should come back for me, that we were too old for this. He said he was afraid to do that because he was afraid I would just laugh in his face if he showed up. I said why would I do that if I asked you to come? He said he didn't know. I told him I had to make a big decision and needed to know if he had decided between us yet. He asked if I was pregnant or if new boyfriend had proposed. Again, I lied and said no because I was terrified of my ex not coming back. He then said I was pushing him for a decision and that I had told him I wouldn't do that. At this point, it had been a year into them dating. He said he still loved me and still didn't know. I tried calling another couple times, noticed he only answered me while he was working. The other two times I talked to him on the phone, he said I had taught him how to have patience. I said that sounded like a goodbye and he said it wasn't. He said he knew he hadn't been a good boyfriend. He said things probably would have been different if I had never gotten sick. I had a teaching job then, and he said he was proud of me. He still said he couldn't decide between her and me. So I blocked him and never unblocked him again. I decided to have my daughter and to fully try with the new guy. I told my dad to never tell me anything about my ex.

After my daughter was born, and was in cardiac ICU still, my father told me out of spite that my ex had married the girl. My world shattered. I have been sexually abused, almost died multiple times, raped in college. I never remembered any of the dates. I still remember the date my dad told me he was married. It was September 9, 2022. I became hysterical, and went driving by myself and didn't know where I was going. I didn't realize till I was almost at my ex's and my old apartment.

It's now been five years since I broke up with my ex, and 3.5 years since we talked. I still think about him every day, and cry all the time. Logically, I know he's married, but I still get panic attacks that if I just reached out and said the right thing, he would come back, and then I start sobbing and can't calm down.

I left a Blue 3 cupper bialetti behind last year. Someone used it. Didn‚Äôt clean it and left the grounds from the last coffee in. Found a surprise 11 months later. Very moldy filter area. 

I tried my best to clean it, I love it and I think it is so wasteful to just bin it. So, is it safe to use? 

This is what I did. Thanks for the advice!!!!

I threw away the gasket and flat filter.

I boiled it as in ‚Äúmade coffee‚Äù with just water in the tank maybe 10 times

I then left the top and bottom and big filter soaking in pure white vinegar for 20 minutes twice (scrubbed in between)

removing gasket and filter means you can see the inside of the funnel. Scrubbed it hard with a thin straw cleaner brush soaked in vinegar

soaked the thing again in water and lemonade and the squeezed lemon

boiled it again 2 or 3 times after installing a new gasket and flat filter

Do you reckon I can go ahead and use it for actual coffee? ",4,1755515663.0,mokapot,2,1.0,False

\
Alt text: Business professionals in a meeting, corporate teamwork in Bahrain. in Bahrain are not just another regulatory hoop. They reflect a new era‚Äîwhere international substance, tax transparency, and ‚Äúreal presence‚Äù matter as much as market potential. And with new 2025 ESR enforcement measures rolling out in the Diplomatic Area and across Tamkeen desks, ignoring these rules is not an option.\
For anyone looking to form a company in Bahrain, understanding ESR is make-or-break. Here‚Äôs the full, firsthand analysis you won‚Äôt get from official brochures or generic ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù lists.\

Bahrain‚Äôs Business Environment in 2025: Growth, Compliance, and Opportunity\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain business district.), while Forbes Business ranked Manama among the ‚ÄúTop 10 Gulf Cities to Launch a Tech Venture.‚Äù\
\
GDP Growth: 4.3% overall in Q1 2025\
Ease of Doing Business: #1 in GCC for SME licensing speed (Forbes Business)\
Foreign Ownership: Up to 100% in most sectors (learn more here; see also 99% foreign ownership explained)\
Popular Business Hubs: Bahrain Financial Harbour, Seef District, Bahrain Bay, Diplomatic Area\
\
Surprisingly, while Dubai and Riyadh offer scale, Bahrain wins on speed, cost, and direct access to decision-makers. (I‚Äôve been waved straight through by EDB officials at Bahrain Bay‚Äîtry doing that in Dubai‚Äôs DIFC during rush hour.)\
But‚Äîregulation is tightening. The Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism (MOICT) rolled out strict ESR compliance audits in February 2025. According to official government bulletins, the new ESR rules impact all companies with relevant activities, including those operating in free zones (see more on free zones).\
\
Understanding Bahrain‚Äôs Economic Substance Requirements (ESR)\
Why Does ESR Matter for Bahrain Company Formation?\
The ESR regime was introduced to align Bahrain with global tax transparency standards‚Äîthink OECD, EU, and FATF. The core requirement: demonstrate ‚Äúreal economic substance‚Äù in Bahrain for certain activities.\
Relevant ESR activities include:\
- Headquarters operations\
- Distribution and service centres\
- Holding companies\
- Intellectual property businesses\
- Banking, insurance, leasing, and shipping\
If your Bahrain company is licensed for any of these, ESR compliance is mandatory.\
\
Opinion: Bahrain‚Äôs ESR is stricter than the UAE for holding and service companies but offers more business model flexibility if you structure your operations‚Äîand documentation‚Äîright.\
\
What Does Demonstrating ‚ÄúEconomic Substance‚Äù Involve?\
At its core, ESR requires you to show:\
* Directed and managed in Bahrain (governance, board meetings in person)\
* Core income-generating activities are conducted in Bahrain\
* Adequate employees, office space, and expenditure in Bahrain\
And, since January 2025, the MOICT and National Bureau for Revenue (NBR) began cross-checking ESR declarations with Sijilat and LMRA records. (I once got flagged over a mismatched board meeting location‚Äîresolved only after a rushed coffee with a MOICT official at the Diplomatic Area branch.)\
\
Typical Challenges: Real-World Obstacles and Fixes\
A frequent mistake I see: entrepreneurs registering a CR for ‚Äúheadquarters‚Äù or ‚Äúdistribution centre‚Äù but failing to lease actual office space or appoint resident directors. MOICT officials are unforgiving if your evidence is thin. (True story‚Äîmy first ESR filing, I underestimated the need for in-person board minutes and lost a precious week chasing signatures.)\
How to prevent this:\
- Rent an office in a business hub (Seef District or Diplomatic Area fastest for paperwork processing)\
- Schedule quarterly board meetings in Bahrain, minuted and signed here\
- Use a reputable local service provider to prepare ESR files (I recommend Keylink‚Äîsee why in their service breakdown)\
\
Step-by-Step: Bahrain Company Formation & ESR Compliance\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, professionals reviewing paperwork.\
- Proof of employee contracts (minimum one full-time for most sectors)\
- Board resolution templates (use Tamkeen‚Äôs free forms)\
- ESR Notification form (download from MOICT portal)\
1. Pre-Formation Planning\
\
Set business activity‚Äîdouble-check if it triggers ESR (see business type structures)\
Pick optimal location (Seef: faster processing; Bahrain Bay: prestige, but higher cost)\
Register on Sijilat portal and reserve trade name\
\
2. Commercial Registration (CR) Procedure\
\
Submit all documents via Sijilat\
Secure office lease and upload contract (Sijilat auto-flags virtual offices for ESR entities)\
Appoint Bahrain-resident directors/managers\
\
Application timing tip: Avoid submission Thursdays and before/after Ramadan‚Äîqueues are much lighter midweek mornings.\
3. Initial ESR Notification\
\
File ESR Notification with MOICT upon CR approval\
Submit annual ESR Return within 6 months of fiscal year-end\
\
Document shortcut: Pre-sign blank board resolutions and keep digital minutes ready to submit.\
\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Bahrain Company Formation & ESR\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs, calculator, money, business finance. range as follows:\
\
MOICT Fees: BHD 200‚Äì400 (payable on application)\
Office Lease: From BHD 200/month (Seef, shared), BHD 350‚Äì600/month (Bahrain Bay, Diplomatic Area)\
Professional Services (ESR compliance): BHD 600‚Äì1,200/year for reputable firms\
LMRA Setup: BHD 50‚Äì75 (new work visas)\
\
Total first-year budget: BHD 1,000‚Äì2,500 depending on location, office size, compliance needs (see full breakdown).\
Money-saving tip: Many entrepreneurs overpay for unnecessary ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù services‚Äîstandard processing is fast enough if documents are complete.\
\
Bahrain Company Structures & ESR Impact\
!(\
- WLL (With Limited Liability)\
- Sole Proprietorship\
- Foreign Branch\
- Holding Company\
Each structure has unique ESR triggers (see guide).\
Example:\
- WLLs with distribution activity must prove employees and real office; holding companies need less, but still must show ‚Äúmanagement and control‚Äù is in Bahrain.\
- Branches often require extra evidence. I once spent hours collecting parent company minutes and Bahrain-based manager logs to satisfy a picky ESR officer.\
Ownership Options\
Bahrain permits up to 100% foreign ownership for most activities‚Äîno local partner required in many cases (ownership rules explained), making it more flexible than, say, UAE outside free zones or Saudi‚Äôs restricted sectors. If your activity requires local sponsorship, see this resource.\
\
2025 Regulatory Changes: What‚Äôs New for ESR?\
Legal compliance is getting sharper. Bahrain‚Äôs February 2025 MOICT decree sets automatic fines (up to BHD 4,000) for late ESR Returns‚Äîapplied as of 1 June 2025. Also, ESR audits now pull data from LMRA, NBR, and MOICT in real time, meaning document fabrication or ‚Äúbox-ticking‚Äù can trigger immediate CR suspension. (MOICT official update)\
\
Common mistake: Submitting ESR Returns with outdated employee or office records. Prevention: Sync Sijilat and LMRA records every quarter.\
\
\
Compliance, Bookkeeping & Beyond: Staying Ahead\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, business regulations, audit.).\
Majlis-style meetings with MOICT officials remain a key networking practice‚Äîbe ready with copies of your latest ESR filings and accept the customary coffee, even if it runs long. Local etiquette shows respect for the process.\
Pro tip: Use a local consultancy with ESR experience‚Äîtheir annual packages save time and avoid costly late fees.\

How to Save Money\
\
Choose shared office suites in Seef for first-year setups‚Äîmeets ESR regulators' needs, costs less\
Avoid overpriced ‚Äúcompliance packs‚Äù from international firms‚Äîlocal Bahraini specialists are more tuned-in to what MOICT actually requires\
\
Bahrain Business Customs That Matter\
\
Schedule regulatory meetings outside Ramadan or after 11 AM during Ramadan‚Äîofficial hours are trimmed, so processing is slower\
Accept coffee during meetings; it‚Äôs both a business courtesy and a sign of patience with the process\
Always have a bilingual Arabic-English summary of your ESR policies ready\
\
(Personal aside: My first-ever ESR board meeting in Bahrain involved an impromptu translation session after a director switched between English and local dialect‚Äîflexibility is key.)\
\
Quick Tangent: Why Bahrain‚Äôs Startup Scene Loves the LMRA ‚ÄúExpress Visa‚Äù\
The LMRA‚Äôs new ‚ÄúExpress Visa‚Äù service (launched April 2025) for company directors shortens onboarding to three days‚Äîa major win over the sometimes weeks-long processes in UAE or KSA. It‚Äôs a reminder that Bahrain‚Äôs ecosystem is always evolving, keeping pace with ESR and other compliance tools.\
And that agility is baked into the very concept of ESR: real people, real activity, in a real Gulf economy.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain ESR and Company Formation ‚Äì Expert Answers\
Q1: Who must comply with Bahrain ESR?\
Any company in Bahrain engaged in ‚Äúrelevant activities‚Äù as defined by MOICT‚Äîincluding holding, distribution, headquarters, service centre, IP, banking, and insurance. Details on requirements.\
Q2: What are the penalties for ESR non-compliance?\
Fines up to BHD 4,000, CR suspension, and public disclosure of offenders. Effective June 2025, late returns trigger automatic fines. Prevent this by syncing your data with Keylink‚Äôs compliance service.\
Q3: How much does full company setup and ESR compliance cost?\
Budget BHD 1,000‚Äì2,500 per year all-in. See complete cost breakdown.\
Q4: Can foreigners own 100% of a Bahrain company?\
Yes, in most sectors, per 2025 MOICT policy. See guide to foreign ownership and special 99% ownership activities.\
Q5: Where can I get step-by-step help with ESR and CR registration?\

Do I need to give a monetary gift on top of everything else?","I'm a bachelorette in a close friends wedding in a few weeks. The problem is however that I have already spent more money on this wedding than I have on most of my close friends weddings (apart from one who lives in my home country, so I flew home and that cost more). 

Most of my friends have had simple 1 evening bachelorette parties, hosted their Bach at their own house or cottage in order to save everyone money. However this one friend had a destination Bach where we were expected to cover all of her expenses (I had thought we would pay for her flights, hotel and maybe the first dinner / drinks) including every single meal, coffee, snack she ate. All of her alcoholic drinks. Every Uber / tickets for public transport. She never offered to pay once just expected someone to to pay up. Side note: out of curiosity I included her in the final Splitwise and she never once opened it to even see if she owed any money.

Her wedding is on the other side of the country so I have also had to pay for travel for me and my husband. I've also paid for my own accomodation at her wedding venue.

In total I have spent ‚Ç¨280 for my flight to her bachelorette. ‚Ç¨230 for my accomodation and contributions towards her portion of the accomodation and flights, ‚Ç¨100 as my portion of the expenses for the bachelorette, ‚Ç¨460 for my accomodation for her wedding. ‚Ç¨200 to travel to the wedding. ‚Ç¨50 for alterations of the dress I would wear.

To be fair she has gifted us the dress, which costs ‚Ç¨50 (unfortunately it didn't fit me well so I did have to shell out to alter it). She also allowed me to wear shoes I already own. There will be 4 meals provided for the weekend of her wedding. And I believe there is an open bar as well. 

My question is, that I am currently unemployed due to health reasons, although my husband does make a good income I feel like I have spend an unreasonable amount on someone else's wedding. I have also overheard her speaking about the wedding and the guests like she is gifting them and invite to her wedding and this expects they gift her to cover their portion of the wedding...

My question is: do I have to give a gift to contribute to the couples honeymoon on top of ""gifting"" her a whole bachelorette weekend vacation in a different country?


I just feel like.... She is the one who decided to have an expensive wedding, not her guests? Why do we have to repay her for what she spent on us? She is also angry with 2 of her close friends who declined to come and didn't have a good enough excuse. So there is no winning here? You can't even say no if you cannot afford it.

**Memory Transcript: Rolem, High Magister of Dawn Creek. Date: \[Standardized Human Time\] November 3nd, 2136.**

The recording played upon the screen behind me. What it showed was something that should not have been surprising: an Exterminator acting in conversely cold blood to burn people alive. While that alone made what it showed wrong in a myriad of ways, such wrongs had been repeated multiple times after the public release that many in the Federation had been omnivores, especially in this very district. It was something we had seen plenty of times over the past couple paws, and this normally would be no different.

But this was different. This footage had something wrong with it; no, *things*. Two facts¬† that separated it from all the other proofs that had been gathered to the detriment of the Office. Facts that had spurred me into this action in the first place, to call this emergency assembly. And one stood forth as something that none could deny:

*This footage was supposedly from a fuel accident well before our release of the Cilany Footage. An entire Paw too early.*

The recording paused, blackened smoke frozen mid-billow shining prominently in its prominence upon the screen. Seizing the moment, I twirled my chair around to face my fellow magisters, all of whom had some variation of a ghastly expression in their features. It was just as disappointing as I was expecting.

Those that remained conscious by this point consisted of Eron, Fior, Parrissmoff, and Prell. Everyone else was either unconscious or desperately crowded around the doors in an attempt to stampede an exit. I sighed in exasperation at their inability to reconcile with the facts in front of their face. ‚ÄúThe doors are locked from the outside, and only I have the code. Return to your seats at *once*.‚Äù

Nothing. They were still trying to push against each other to vacate the room, a complete blind panic from nothing but a video on a screen. Why was our society like this? Why did we get taught growing up that this level of reaction was understandable and even encouraged?

*How long ago would I have reacted the exact same way?*

I stood, cracking my neck and straightening my sleeves in preparation for what I was about to do. Then, clasping my hands together behind my back, I emptied my lungs so that they may be filled again to capacity. The other magisters were still attempting to push through.

‚ÄúEron, Magisters still at the Table?‚Äù I stated. ‚ÄúIf you value your hearing, please cover your ears.‚Äù

This was not something I did often, not just because of how undignified it sounded. In fact, I could count the moments I recollected doing so upon one claw. But this was a situation that called for it. I took a deep breath‚Ä¶

And Bugled.

It was not really what you would call a pleasant sound, not in the slightest. I never had the most elegant call, it hit a pitch that could only really be described as off-key, but it was very useful for one thing: snapping people out of their panic by means of redirecting their attention. It tended to be hard for one to continue scrambling when all they can think of is the sensational ringing in their ears.

*Mine included. But there is no time to break.*

Those that had covered their ears slowly undid that action, and where before there was a mass of fur and wool attempting to breach the exit, there was now a bundle of individuals massaging their auditory organs. And so, with everyone‚Äôs attention now firmly upon me, I ceased my call and took a breath. ‚ÄúNow, if you are all quite done acting like scared cubs, I will repeat myself only once: return to your seats so we may *properly* address this!‚Äù

Hesitantly, the remainder of my subordinate politicians made their way back to their positions at the arched Magisterial desk, though not completely without complaint. That was fine, I could deal with their resentment. If I could not handle their grumbles regarding my volume, I most certainly would not be able to deal with their complaints in the coming paws.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù I stated once everyone was seated, ‚ÄúLet us get to the core of this meeting since you have all made it so clear how dire this evidence is. This evidence was recovered from an abandoned warehouse roughly oh-point-six paws before our announcement went live. I have already directed for any recovered remains to be preserved for the purposes of identification in the wake of this news. Any thoughts on the matter?‚Äù

A cough came forth from Magister Oqya ‚ÄúWhat about the two who trapped everyone? They were helping load and take everything out! We-we don‚Äôt know about them and what they had to do with everything!‚Äù

‚ÄúAs a matter of fact, I happen to have a good idea who they are,‚Äù I explained. ‚ÄúThey have been identified and confirmed to be a pair of reporters who were on the trail of the largest drug smuggling network on the planet. Ones who, barely a paw later, took that whole network down after uprooting their hidden headquarters in the Scorched Sands district. An act that, if it had happened at any other time, would have been the biggest news event on the planet!‚Äù

*Just behind Solgalick themselves appearing at some backwater restaurant! Damn the Federation and Exterminators!!*

Fior was next to speak, their ears perked in shock. ‚ÄúBut- wait, the whole network? That- that doesn‚Äôt mean they weren‚Äôt involved in the crash! We saw them at the corner of the footage following the shuttle‚Äôs descent into the warehouse!‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe, but I highly doubt they‚Äôre at fault as a shuttle seen escaping their takedown decided to warp on a heading straight into our star. So I have grave doubts about the skills of the pilots employed by this cabal.‚Äù I gave my paw a dismissive wave. ‚ÄúRegardless, this is separate from the issue on the table. That being the behavior of that black-suited Exterminator that systematically entered the shuttle and burned entire crates of people alive!‚Äù

I adjusted the video so that it was frozen upon the frame of the Venlil firing their flamer into the open container, the cargo bay‚Äôs damaged doors opened at just the right angle to catch the whole thing. The orange glow reflected into their lenses, thankfully only showing the flames being shot out rather than the writhing bodies of those they‚Äôre burning. It was oddly high quality for an outdated security camera, but I could not claim to be an expert in illicit substance distribution. Not unless you were to count coffee.

‚ÄúThe footage and the records stored within the blackbox show that‚Äîafter the crash‚Äîthe alarm was sounded for the Exterminators to respond. But then, right before this officer appears, it is deactivated by an official Exterminator key, proof of which you will find in the meeting files. After they enter the shuttle, a glow can be sighted from both the cockpit and crew cabin windows \[2 minutes\] later, and upon his exit, they open this cargo container in the primary warehouse prior to the start of the fire. They not only *deny* the people inside freedom by forcing them back in, but *execute* them all extra-judiciously by way of emptying their flamer into the container they kept them trapped in.‚Äù

I took a shaky breath, staring back out at the gathered politicians before me as I prepared to make my ultimate thesis. ‚ÄúMembers of the Magistratta, what we are looking at here is proof of official misconduct by the office, increasing the death toll of their terror by an uncertainly high number‚Äîpotentially numbering in *triple digits.* This cannot be ignored, because I will remind you, when other officers appeared at the scene, it was labeled as a fuel accident due to the sheer amount of damage done to the property along with both the severity and length of the fire! This is direct *proof* of a cover-up, designed to kill civilians they saw fit to burn without even a *hope* of due process! Who knows how many other examples of this could‚Äôve been occurring between our eyes without even a lick of suspicion being cast; not just here, but in countless other districts!‚Äù

My voice had a fervor in it as I began to rattle off a list of known office offences that had been documented across the planet. ‚ÄúScorched Sands, Sidestar, Soulroot, Bellowing Forest, even Dayside City itself! All across the planet, the Exterminators Offices have proven to be unreliable protection at best and an actively dangerous actor towards our own civilians at worst! You have seen proof of the latter with your own eyes, and that is why I have convened this meeting today. I come bearing a proposition for you that I intend to pass with unilateral support; anything less, and I am certain we will have a Code Zero called upon us all.‚Äù

‚ÄúHold on now,‚Äù Fior objected, rising from his seat to challenge me. ‚ÄúHow do we know this wasn‚Äôt some advanced operative for the True Exterminators? Might I still remind you that Kevros is *still* missing? It‚Äôs entirely possible that this individual is the genesis of the movement, and somehow overheard our communications with him! We can‚Äôt assume ill of every Exterminator on the planet due to the actions of some bad actors!‚Äù

I was about to respond before my pad chimed from the tabletop, and I picked it up for a glance. The picture of a Tilfish appeared upon it, with words of ‚Äúwe found them. They confirmed the presence of the individual and spoke to them that paw‚Äù below. I wagged.

‚ÄúThe actions cannot be so clearly reaped,‚Äù I countered. ‚ÄúI have just gotten reports that a Tilfish who had been guarding the warehouse has been found by the police earlier this paw. This person has testified that they talked to the Exterminator in question, and were sent away entirely unharmed. As we are all aware, the Tilfish have been discovered to be one of the omnivorus races who had been altered, which means that this officer leaving the guard alive casts doubt upon any theories that their actions were derived from an early leak of there being Omnivorous people.‚Äù

Fior looked to be about to argue further, but I moved to scrub the video back so it was showing the workers being tricked into being trapped. ‚ÄúFurthermore, the entirety of the workers who were trapped within the burnt container were Venlil, with the exception of a single Gojid that was herded into the other container that is skipped over by the officer later in the footage, presumably because he assumed it to be empty. That casts grave doubts upon any premeditated connection to the True Exterminators. No, this was planned well before-paw, and *before you ask, Fior,* the reporters have been confirmed to not have any connection to this individual.‚Äù

*If Valorec is correct about the striped one, that is.*

That seemed to silence any opposition from the Magister of Law and Order, as he returned to his seat. I had suspected it would be a mistake to inform the Exterminator Chief of our plans, but I hadn‚Äôt then fathomed the scale of corruption and cruelty within the office. As I looked around the table, I saw enough disdain, horror, and even sickness in a couple cases to feel confident in finally getting to the point I‚Äôd been building towards. ‚ÄúThis was a crime against sapience, committed knowingly by an actor of the Dawn Creek Extermination Office, and it is for this reason‚Äîalong with the litany of other crimes committed by the True Exterminators‚Äîthat I motion to immediately cease reconstitution efforts of the Dawn Creek Exterminator‚Äôs Guild, transfer all law-keeping and emergency response duties, along with any prospective recruits, to the police and emergency departments respectively, and finally, *permanently abolish* the Office and any presence it has in the Dawn Creek district as a whole!‚Äù

*Oh okay it would appear it is my turn to have my ears hurt.*

The uproar that resulted from that decision was cacophonous, voices from just about every magister in attendance fighting one another for their attempt to drown out all the others. My ears were immediately pinned to my head as I watched almost every attendant of the meeting try to get my attention, but when I took a deep breath to bugle once more, the noises suddenly ceased. Taking the opportunity, I made myself speak loudly. ‚ÄúOne at a time, *please!*‚Äù

‚ÄúYou just cannot do it!‚Äù Fior stated plainly, naturally the first to speak given the matter at paw. ‚ÄúEven in the most practical sense, the duties of the exterminators and police are too different! The police are meant to investigate banal offenses: theft, financial crimes, speeding, fraud! They aren‚Äôt supposed to be constantly involved with violent activities!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are *almost* correct,‚Äù I flicked my ears forward. ‚ÄúThe police are indeed different and hold different focuses in their actions. But frankly, even those actions are unduly tread upon by the Exterminators. The whole incident in Sidestar was from a Magister using Exterminator Fraud on a grand scale with impunity, and where were the police? Not corrupted, but cowed into submission.‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù Parissmoff agreed, sitting up straighter in their seat. ‚ÄúPrell and I have looked into the methods they used as an example of how *not* to handle the fraud you have had us perform on Prell‚Äôs suggestion, but I can‚Äôt claim it wasn‚Äôt prophetic of you to do so. Financial damages were leagues higher than we could‚Äôve anticipated before the attacks, and it may be only due to these shorts that we‚Äôre able to financially recover at all. Still, it was indeed the Exterminators who halted investigations into building code violations that were meant to be handled by police, and the attempted assassination of High Magister Ghaerun was more or less sanctioned by the Guild there as per the Code Zero investigation. He‚Äôs since been dismissed due to unearthed relations with his Takkan personal assistant‚Äîor rather, stepped down of his own volition‚Äîbut it cannot be denied the role the Sidestar office held in covering up and abetting the widespread construction fraud while obscuring the truth from the High Magister at the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve‚Ä¶ been keeping tabs on the Scorched Sands situation as well,‚Äù Oqya slowly stated, much to my astoundment. ‚ÄúThe drug cabal was using a large hangar complex underneath the Temple of Solgalick as their base of operations, one that has no records of ever being constructed in all of Venlil Prime‚Äôs recorded history. That leaves two possibilities: either it was somehow made when the temple was‚Äîwhich I \*highly doubt‚Äî\*or its construction was kept off the record by someone in the Magistratta. From the Code Zero called in that district, it‚Äôs already been reported that the Magister of Finance and Accounting, former ambassador Vane, has not been able to be located, and considering the multiple Exterminators that were apprehended in the ensuing investigation, it‚Äôs entirely possible the Guild there was either threatened, paid off, or *both* to facilitate the continuing poisoning of our populous by means of illegal, highly-addictive drugs‚Äù.

For the first time in this meeting, Syis piped up. ‚ÄúBut in all these examples, Exterminators were also helped to arrest those who were part of the uncovered corruption! Even here, there were Exterminators who worked against the killers! The True Exterminators explicitly left those who disagreed with them behind to die, you yourself commended that Kolshian girl, Nhilasi, for her bravery and actions that paw! If you think the office is irrevocably corrupted, wouldn‚Äôt the most obvious and reasonable route be to rebuild it with people like them?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but be impressed. It was a well-articulated, thoughtful argument, and one that I had no doubt many would see reasonable, yet it was flawed. The light from a fire might be easily mistaken as Solgalick‚Äôs own to those still trapped in the darkness of the caves of ignorance. ‚ÄúA valiant ideal in principle, but answer me this: was that not what we were supposed to be doing this whole time? These were people who joined for the noble cause of protecting the herd from predators, but that goal was far too easily turned against those they once swore to protect. The Office is not a law-keeping force, but rather an ideologically-motivated sector that‚Äôs been given far too much autonomy over our pawly lives. If this could happen once, it could happen again, even if we ‚Äútried to rebuild with people like Nhilasi‚Äù because the very *nature* of the Office dictates it so. Why should we not pre-empt that reality entirely by expanding the purviews of already existing institutions to cover the grounds the Office once fulfilled? Even if only *some* of the Exterminators vacated their duties in favor of wanton destruction and murder, the possibility of recurrence is a risk we cannot afford *not* to waylay.‚Äù¬†

¬†I heard a snort from Fior, a derisive one at that. ‚ÄúFine. For the sake of argument, let‚Äôs say we go ahead with your plan. What‚Äôs to stop the same system from forming with the police? Especially if you plan on redirecting Exterminator recruits towards their training.‚Äù

‚ÄúOther than the fact they wouldn‚Äôt have flamethrowers that could literally destroy a city block?‚Äù I huffed, but I knew that he was looking for an answer with more substance. ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs not all. They would not have an enemy explicitly detailed for them to be overvigilant for, not like the Exterminators. The Office were *hunters* in all but name; these will be protectors, defending against any who would seek to perform harm against the population, be they predator, prey, or anyone in-between. In short, they would fulfill the spirit of the office in the eyes of the recruits, rather than induct and train them to be capable of perpetrating such horrible monstrosities as has been shown they‚Äôre capable of under the current system.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd what, we‚Äôre supposed to fix this all in a single meeting?‚Äù Fior laughed, standing stalwart as my most prominent adversary in this motion as I‚Äôd suspected he would. ""Do you have any *idea* what a move of that magnitude will do to our political careers? Tarva is the governor, and she only has a 27% approval rating, and it‚Äôs exactly because of stunts like this! I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm looking to ensure my place on this Magistratta after your inevitable failure at re-election so that I might work towards *actual change,* not this- this *radical pipe dream!!*‚Äù¬†

Well, it seemed I was going to drop my bombshell early. ‚ÄúSo your main concern is reelection, I see.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, it is, because people who aren‚Äôt in office *can‚Äôt make things better, Rolem,*‚Äù Fior chided me. ‚ÄúI get that you‚Äôre upset, we *all are,* but uprooting a system that‚Äôs been in place for centuries is going to do nothing but make you seem like a fool! Abolishing the office? Try it, and you‚Äôll never see a seat of power again in your *life!!*‚Äù

‚ÄúThen how would you feel if I said that I have no expectation to be elected into any government position after the completion of my term in the first place?‚Äù

Fior was stunned into silence, the response he had likely prepared caught dead in his throat. The room‚Äîin direct opposition to how it had been before‚Äîsat in a state of stale silence as the rest of the Magisters processed my words. ‚ÄúI am under no illusion as to my chances, Fior. The reasons for that are not simply for this motion, they go much further back.‚Äù

I continued to seize the initiative while the rest of the Magistratta was still quiet. ‚ÄúI am the High Magister who oversaw the completion of the Tarlim debacle and its protests, who was in power when the patients of the facility were cast out and effectively disappeared, who has been propping up industry while district agriculture struggles. My term has been one of turmoil and chaos, with my approval ratings only kept up thanks to my careful consideration of your proposed policies and the economic prosperity of this region. These traits are not unique to me, and I will not pretend as though they are. Essentially to the public, I am a dull man who has inspired nobody.‚Äù

I took a breath. ‚ÄúEven if humanity never appeared, the chances of my re-election were already low, but I did not take this office for the cushy chair and the stable pay. I took it to make a difference, a difference I was unable to make in the past. Yet up until now, that was something I have failed to do properly. And now, I have the opportunity to seize a scythe and thresh a harvest. Whatever happens in the next local election cycle, I want to leave a legacy, a legacy that shows it *is* possible to exist without the Exterminators looming a shadow of potential annihilation over us should we dare become too ‚Äòpredatory.‚Äô The galaxy is moving forward, and should wish to not wish to be left behind, then we need to start running *now.* So, who will run with me?‚Äù

I looked across the room, hoping to see an uptick of flicking ears and raised tails, but it was still deathly quiet. Everyone was avoiding my gaze, their features muted and pressed, all except for Fior who still stared at me defiantly‚Ä¶up until a paw was raised. A Gojid‚Äôs paw.

‚ÄúI-uh, I don‚Äôt think my career has good future prospects either,‚Äù Eron muttered, struggling to meet my eyes. ‚ÄúSo I had better do what I can, *while* I can. I‚Äôve seen what‚Ä¶ what the Exterminators are capable of, what they‚Äôve done not just to my people, but the people of this planet as well. If I can help prevent that from ever happening again‚Ä¶ I-I‚Äôm going to take it.‚Äù

Then, to his left, a Zurulian‚Äôs paw. Retyu‚Äôs paw. ‚ÄúI hadn‚Äôt considered the psychological aspect of the Exterminators when making the PSA. I know now that people so radically devoted to a cause can‚Äôt be effectively reasoned with. If what you‚Äôre saying about de-radicalizing those recruits is true, then I want to help in whatever way I can. For a safer paw than the last.‚Äù

That was followed by both Fissian and Venli paws from across the table, belonging to Parissmoff and Prell. ‚ÄúThe damages that came from this attack were far greater than any models could‚Äôve predicted,‚Äù Prell spoke up as Parissmoff nodded along. ‚ÄúRetyu‚Äôs right, people so fervent in their beliefs shouldn't have access to the ability to level an entire city if they so well please, if only for the reasons of ensuring we don‚Äôt completely collapse the planetary economy. Besides, I‚Äôm sure new deals could be brokered with the police to match‚Äîand potentially exceed‚Äîwhat we were allowed to do with the Exterminators.‚Äù

Slowly but surely, every other paw at the table rose in agreement, with Jesh being second to last to raise his. My tail wagged behind me as I allowed myself to smugly look down upon the last remaining holdout. ‚ÄúWell? It would appear as though the majority consensus has been reached. What say you, Fior?‚Äù

He stared at me, narrowing his eyes and angling his ears at me in contempt, but eventually his shoulders slumped and he sighed. ‚ÄúFine, I can read the room. If everyone else is going to follow you into the Arxur‚Äôs maw, there‚Äôs no use in being the political fall guy for when this enevitably fails. You‚Äôd better be sure that everything is up to snuff on this, because I will *not* defend you to the press. Oh, and I *am* going to formally request to be made the chief commanding officer of the police force; they‚Äôre going to need someone with experience in the field, and who better than a retired Exterminator chief?‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúI see no reason not to,‚Äù I answered levelly. ‚ÄúDespite your antagonistic presence today, I am more than aware of your honorable service. Like you said, they will need someone to lead them through the first transitionary period, and you definitely need the exercise. Hopefully you did not misconstrue our conclusions of the office as a whole as a judgement of your character.‚Äù

Fior huffed pointedly at me. ‚ÄúDo you really want to play games with backpawed insults, Rolem? You know I can play that game too, and I have much more damning dirt on you than you do on me. That obnoxious item of clothing you‚Äîand Eron, for some Stars-damned reason‚Äîinsist upon wearing doesn‚Äôt even scratch the surface.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre all finally in agreement,‚Äù I continued on, choosing to *ignore* his maligned comment regarding my fashionable accessory. ‚ÄúIf there are no further objections, I shall be addressing the press regarding our findings. If you have anything else to say, you should do so now.‚Äù

The room was silent, but just as I was about to clasp my paws together, Retyu leaned forward. ‚ÄúI do have something to ask, actually.‚Äù I angled my ears to encourage her to continue. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I would like to motion to destroy this footage.‚Äù

That‚Ä¶ honestly caught me off-guard. It was unlike her to condone any form of censorship, let alone be the one to *suggest it.* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I understand your motion, Retyu. You‚Äôre requesting this footage be destroyed‚Ä¶ why? It is critical incriminating evidence against the Exterminators Guild, it must be directed through the correct channels.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know what I said, Rolem, and it isn‚Äôt for no reason,‚Äù Retyu maintained, her voice wavering slightly. ‚ÄúYou have first-paw knowledge of how rapidly such inflammatory footage can spur action, *violent action.* There is a chance that if this‚Ä¶ this *atrocity* is released to the public, it could spark widespread action against Offices all across the planet. The last thing we need now is more death, and even if it might sound flimsy‚Ä¶ after seeing what the True Exterminators were capable of, we don‚Äôt need a fledgling violent-offenses police force inundated with attacks on former officers or those perceived to be former officers. The people have had enough pain already, let's not give them any more reason to hurt themselves.‚Äù

I took a moment to consider her viewpoint. While I was not keen on keeping hidden such prominent examples of Exterminator brutality, my mind wandered back to how the more skittish magisters had responded to it. Ultimately, I knew what my answer would be‚Ä¶ but considering all the concessions the rest of the Magistratta was already making for me, it would be unbecoming to not hear their opinions on the matter. ‚ÄúDo the rest of you hold that viewpoint?‚Äù

Paws around the room raised once again in a much more expedient manner, Fior‚Äôs being on the first this time. I supposed I should‚Äôve seen this coming, but it still hurt to know that this would be the cost of my most radical motion. Like Fior, though, I was capable of reading the room, and unlike him, I intended to be a much better sport about it. ‚ÄúSo long as I have all of your words that you will support me in my motion unilaterally, I will concede the destruction of this footage for the sake of maintaining public peace. Do we have an agreement?‚Äù

A multitude of ear flicks and tail motions indicated our deal had been struck, and with a heavy heart, I deleted the file from every device it had been uploaded to, including the black box itself. I prayed to Solgalick that nobody would go looking in there again, but I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be so lucky. Hopefully Venric is still in the legal business in a few years time. ‚ÄúIt is done. Now, if you will all excuse me, I must address the press. Meeting: adjourned.‚Äù

As everyone started to rise from their seats, I entered the access code into my pad to unlock the meeting hall doors. Most of the magisters began filing out in a ponderous, almost dazed manner, save for Retyu and Eron, who moved to join me. While I had not been intending on having any backup for my appearance in front of the press, by the looks on their faces, I knew I would not be able to stop them. With a few cursory signs of confirmation, we all moved the other direction, stepping into the awaiting press room.

Immediately, countless lights and lenses shone down upon me, a roar of questions assaulting my ears and the ears of my compatriots. It persisted until I finally arrived at the podium, and after clearing my throat of any latent mucus, I tapped the microphone to quiet the reporters down. ‚ÄúThank you all for attending this emergency meeting. I have come to inform the citizens of Dawn Creek of an urgent decision made with unilateral support from the rest of the Magistratta, in no small part due to recent events. It is with grief for the lives lost in the attack by the so-called ‚ÄòTrue Exterminators‚Äô that I am announcing‚Ä¶‚Äù

Have been messaging each other outside of work for a few months now. Kind of secretly because we have a very gossipy office. Sometimes it‚Äôs flirty but we both default into bro vibe most of the time. We always wait for the other to finish work and walk out together almost daily, even if sometimes one of us hanging back half an hour or more.

the left side of my throat sometimes becomes a bit painful when i swallow, but no globus or mucus, it‚Äôs relatively normal. 

i saw a GP and she thinks it could be reflux (said my neck + throat looked normal - no dysphasia, mild red throat). she also ordered a blood test to check my thyroid function. i sometimes do notice a bit of acid reflux in my throat, but it‚Äôs very mild with no heartburn and isn‚Äôt everyday.

could this be LPR? has anyone else had one-sided symptoms like this?

1mtivtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mtivtx/bridgebuilder_chapter_150/,Bridgebuilder - Chapter 150,"The Deepest Cut

[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wygr3l/bridgebuilder_in_the_unknown/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mn8gxm/bridgebuilder_chapter_149/)

It took Alex a second to parse what was happening here. Zenshen laughed as she tried to wash two donuts down with a cup of coffee, spewing crumbs across the table. The marines had settled down and gone back to eating, chuckling about whatever Alex had just missed.

Crenshaw was still beet red. ‚ÄúLook, I just- I was worried, all right. I didn‚Äôt know that you- that Tsla‚Äôo could eat chocolate. I hadn‚Äôt noticed any of you eating it before and...‚Äù

Hang the fuck on. Hang right the fuck on.

‚ÄúDude.‚Äù Alex interjected, already seeing what road had led to this moment. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fucking slur, not an instruction manual.‚Äù

The marines got quiet after that. They had been laughing along with Zenshen, who was still amused. Kind of smug, actually. ‚ÄúNah, nah. He‚Äôs fine. Stupid mistake, but he‚Äôs learned from it. *Right, Crenshaw*?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I wasn‚Äôt thinking, I just saw what she had and knew that... non-humans have trouble with theobromine and caffeine.‚Äù He laid his hands out on the table, and he did look apologetic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a bigot, I just didn‚Äôt want to see somebody get hurt.‚Äù

Zenshen chuffed at that, smirking into her cup. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt seen me getting coffee with every meal.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my god man, it‚Äôs in the primer. They can eat everything we can!‚Äù Alex was a little heated up about this and the brakes were not working. It wasn‚Äôt *this* thing - Zenshen didn‚Äôt care, and Dominic Crenshaw was clearly recalcitrant. But it was the top layer of everything that had stacked up. All the spy shit he perceived as ruining his life because he fell in love wrong, somebody trying to build weapons in here, and now Crenshaw‚Äôs casual racism. His jaw worked, teeth grinding, and he didn‚Äôt even *want* to stop it. 

He wanted to be able to come down on *somebody* over *something*.

Why not Crenshaw and his stupid choices? 

Alex was seething at this point. Fists clenched as he scanned his fellow Humans in the room. ‚ÄúEverybody had to read that, right? Everybody signed off that they had read it? Right?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlex. Let‚Äôs just... Take a step back.‚Äù Crenshaw held his hands up defensively, still embarrassed but . ‚ÄúI admit, I just skimmed it. I figured there‚Äôd be plenty of time to actually read the thing once I was here.‚Äù

‚Äú*Sorenson!*‚Äù Sergeant Zenshen was doing a good enough impression of a Drill Instructor that the marines straightened up by reflex alone. She glared at him and swilled the rest of her coffee, now dead serious. ‚ÄúPerhaps you should take a moment to cool off so you can *read the room* before we continue this conversation.‚Äù

Alex sucked in a breath and exhaled, Zenshen‚Äôs tone enough to make him rethink the path he was going down. It didn‚Äôt unclench his jaw. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

He left without another word, the Artifact‚Äôs winter still crisp and cold and biting - Alex didn‚Äôt bother with his hood, just stalked back up the hill to the hanger and did not consider how long it‚Äôd take to get frostbite. He was boiling inside and not really thinking about where he was going - just that he wanted to be somewhere that wasn‚Äôt the mess.

He felt irrational, he could *tell* he was irrational right now, and that just made it worse. Alex returned to one of the places he felt in control, even if it was currently ripped apart and inoperable: the shuttle. *His* shuttle.

There was no hiding in the sparse hanger. Carbon and Zheng both saw him return, glaring at the world directly in front of him as he made a bee line for the Corvin, taking the steps up two at a time. It was pointless, but he sat in the captain‚Äôs chair and moved it up into place, feet on the pedals, left hand on the stick, right on the throttle, so many holes in the instrument cluster that all he could turn on was the cabin power.

Carbon padded up the stairs behind him, her steps lacking the two-stage, heel-toe noise a walking Human made. The door controls beeped, the hatch closing as she approached the cockpit. She stood behind him, hands on his shoulders, voice low and cautious. ‚ÄúWhat is going on?‚Äù

It took a long while for him to peel the words out. The further from the moment he got, the easier it was to see that he had overreacted. Crenshaw was embarrassed but still apologetic, barely getting defensive even after Alex started yelling. Zenshen didn‚Äôt even *care*. ‚ÄúI arrived in the mess to find Crenshaw being... stupid. In a way that I initially perceived as being racist.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it so?‚Äù Her tone had not changed, but there was a hint of curiosity in it now.

‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù He sighed, fingers counting over the switches on the control stick, tapping each one in order. ‚ÄúHe was worried that Tsla‚Äôo shouldn‚Äôt eat chocolate. Zenshen thought it was funny.‚Äù

Carbon hummed behind him, thinking. ‚ÄúI do not understand how that is stupid, or racist.‚Äù

‚Äú*Dogs*, the actual animal from Earth, they can‚Äôt have chocolate. It‚Äôll kill them.‚Äù *Somebody think of the children*. Zenshen wasn‚Äôt exactly a good bean in the way he had found Neya to be. She could be crass, which tracked from the ‚Äòlearned how to interact with Human from Marines‚Äô part of her life. Zenshen was also honest and he believed her when she said she had his back. Literally trusted her with his life as part of his security detail.

So yeah, he had gotten heated about it.

‚ÄúThat is more understandable.‚Äù She paused, tapping a finger on his collarbone. ‚ÄúHas he read the primer?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe skimmed it.‚Äù

‚ÄúMmh.‚Äù Carbon drummed her fingers now, processing all of this. ‚ÄúAnd Zenshen was not bothered by this?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. She was laughing about it. Making fun of him for it, actually.‚Äù Fuck, how stupid was he? Zenshen didn‚Äôt need protection over something she was actively talking shit about. At the bare minimum those Marines had been on her side, too. *Everyone* liked her, as far as Alex could tell. ‚ÄúI just got out of hand, like I was incensed. I dunno. Maybe the new title is going to my head. Been hanging out with Eleya too much.‚Äù

It made sense to Alex, anyway. It felt reasonable to him to think: I am defensive of this person because I am a leader for them. I am taking the defense of my people seriously.

She shook her head. ‚ÄúI can understand how that would make you mad, but that is not why it has upset you so.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù He did not get where she was going with that, at all.

Carbon leaned over him, peeking out the side window of the cockpit towards where Zheng would be working on the Falcata. Satisfied with what she saw, she slipped her arms around his neck in a gentle hug, her chin resting on his head. ‚ÄúHe reminds you, of you.‚Äù

Alex fiddled with the control stick a bit more. ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs not it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat had you called me, before we met? A fucking dog?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt sound mad or hurt about that. Just stating it as a matter of fact.

‚ÄúWell, I didn‚Äôt- I didn‚Äôt mean you, I just-‚Äù All of that came flowing out, very very quickly before he stopped talking, mouth closing so fast his teeth clicked, cheeks burning. How could he deny a memory she had seen? He had been talking about her as an entirely abstract concept, at the time, but had said it without a second thought. Alex continued, quietly. ‚ÄúYeah, I did.‚Äù

Carbon nodded, her chin tapping his head, and still speaking in a very factual tone. ‚ÄúBut you did not say that out of concern. For someone else, I mean.‚Äù

He sighed. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù What else could he say? It was all over not being able to name a ship - one he hadn‚Äôt even been promised naming rights to. He just heard it was new and jumped to a conclusion. That‚Äôs all it had taken.

She gave him a squeeze, hand patting his chest over his heart. *I will never forget it, but I have *seen* you. Your regret, your desire to do better. Your actions to see that intent through. You tried in earnest to forge a rapport with me, repeatedly, when I did nothing to reciprocate. It is endearing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù He reached up to squeeze her hand, warm under his fingers that were still cold from the walk up to the hanger. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I knew better, and I fucked up.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did. Someday, I will accept that apology.‚Äù She glanced out the window again and kissed the top of his head.

‚ÄúNot today?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, there is too much yet to do today.‚Äù There was just a hint of a tease in her voice, and she patted his chest again. ‚ÄúIt is strange. When I reflect upon everything, I realize it was a human that convinced me you were worth... Us.‚Äù

Alex tilted his head, trying to look up at her. Their relationship had flourished in a pressure cooker, just the two of them in a nearly destroyed ship in a system controlled by the very xenophobic Eohm. What other human could she mean? ‚ÄúOk, you‚Äôve got me intrigued.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was that same memory, actually. You said that, and the way Ed looked at you...‚Äù She paused and clicked her teeth together, considering her words carefully. ‚ÄúIt was the first time I had seen a complex burst of emotions on a Human‚Äôs face, and truly understood it without second guessing myself. I saw that he was shocked, angry, and disappointed. I viscerally knew that he looked that way because he expected you to be better than that. It is likely that was because I was in your memory and just assimilated that understanding, but it was so *clear*. Your words were petulant and stupid, not a sign of deeper malevolent beliefs.‚Äù

Alex nodded as she talked. ‚ÄúThat was pretty much how I interpreted it. When they brought me back into the program Ed said it was because I was an outlier among the usual pilots. I get what he means now, but at the time I let it go to my head.‚Äù He sighed. That reality check Ed handed him had been important. ‚ÄúPetulant and stupid describes that moment perfectly, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was your original failing? Too willing to take chances?‚Äù There was a trace of humor in her voice, a smile curling up into those questions.

‚ÄúThat was the big one.‚Äù He manages a single quiet laugh, ‚Äúand look what it got me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think-‚Äù Carbon stopped talking suddenly and stood up, one hand remaining on the pilot‚Äôs chair as she smoothed her clothes out. ‚ÄúWilliams.‚Äù

Alex didn‚Äôt try to look. The shuttle was just tall enough on its landing gear that he couldn‚Äôt see a person standing outside it while seated. Or the pedestrian door at all. ‚ÄúProbably here to throw me in the brig. Give me some room so I can get up.‚Äù

She stepped aside as he rolled the chair back. Alex felt shitty now, but at least he wasn‚Äôt so mad he was acting stupid.

Williams knocked twice and then keyed the controls on the outside, the hatch lowering slowly to grant her access. She did look a little annoyed as she stepped inside. ‚ÄúLan. Sorenson.‚Äù The Lieutenant didn‚Äôt say anything else until the hatch had closed again.

‚ÄúFirst, about the incident in the mess. Sergeant Zenshen did not want to formally file any complaints, said that she thought Crenshaw was acting in good faith even if he was a big dumbass. Her words. My guys in there agreed that he spoke out of misguided concern.‚Äù

Alex cleared his throat. ‚ÄúHang on. I overreacted quite a bit when I walked into that. Sounds like Zenshen is all right, how‚Äôs Crenshaw?‚Äù

She regarded him for a moment, brown eyes searching his face. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still feeling embarrassed, but fine otherwise.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. I'll apologize next time I see him. Sorry to interrupt.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna happen.‚Äù Williams seemed resigned to being interrupted when talking to people. She turned to Carbon. ‚ÄúGot your email about the power cells. I‚Äôm willing to consider the items on pallets as accidental, but hiding cells that powerful somewhere in a disguised container that most people would never be able to recognize as wrong just *reeks*. I want those locked down, tight as you can, I don‚Äôt care where or how. Related to all of this, I‚Äôve got a call with Admiral Serrat tomorrow and I want you there for it, Lan. That these things were packaged with vehicles that are two-thirds anti-ship drone munition is just the cherry on top of shit mountain.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, speaking of things that aren‚Äôt right in the vehicles. The AR goggles flagged this as the wrong plug and potential damage. It‚Äôs the primary connector from the instruments to the main conduit. I‚Äôm also going to need a new cable.‚Äù Alex interrupted, again, digging the plug out of his pocket and handing it over to Carbon. ‚ÄúI was going to give it to you later, but now seems like a good time.‚Äù

She peered into the glob of resin, squinting. ‚ÄúI do not know what this is, but I will put it on a deep scan. It will reveal its secrets.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat explains the carnage in here.‚Äù Williams looked tired of finding new things that were suspicious. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave you to that and whatever else you‚Äôre doing with this stuff... If anyone asks, I was just making sure the thing with Crenshaw is smoothed over.‚Äù

Williams reached for the hatch controls, hesitating. ‚ÄúAnd then let me know who was asking.‚Äù

That's right, paying off his little toddler tantrum that happened all the way back in chapter 4. The memory of his tantrum anyway. Also, Williams is done. Whoever is doing this will be cooked should she find out. In the corona of the nearest star.

Also, hit 150! Nice. Had a busy week, did not move the needle on the patreon, but did polish some of the stories that will be going up on there first. Here's hoping I get the time to actually do the new cover this week.

Weight: 

	Start - 225lbs, End - 211lbs

Side Effects: 

	Minimal

Dosage: 

	2.5mg (just started 5mg)

Summary: 

	I burned 14lbs in a month. Crazy. I‚Äôve been putting on 10lbs a year since I turned 40 and there was nothing I could do to stop or lose that weight. Tried every diet and I‚Äôd just yo-yo‚Äôd back, then gained. Zepbound did the trick. No obvious medical reason for this. I have low vitamin D but otherwise no issues. I suspect it‚Äôs a combination of stress and middle age. I was 70lbs overweight and decided I needed to do something before it got worse. Hoping to hit high school weight by the end of 2025, but we will see, any progress is good.

The Numbers: 

	You have to burn about 3,500 calories to lose a pound. I‚Äôm on a 2,000 calorie diet, and I‚Äôve been eating about 800 calories a day on average. This is way too low, but I have no hunger most times. This means in one week I should be consuming 14,000 calories, but I am consuming about 5,600. Losing 4lbs means I would have burned 3,500x4 =14,000 calories. The math doesn‚Äôt math. Some of the loss must have been water weight I was retaining. I am prone to inflammation, and pre-Zepbound I was universally HOT all the time. Like stupidly, burning hot. My wife, who is always cold and sleeps under two heavy blankets even in summer, will not sleep next to me because ‚ÄúI am burning up.‚Äù Now I am cold. 

Week 1: First shot was a bit painful. I had stomach cramps all day and felt nauseous, but no other side effects. These subsided by day four, and I felt fine afterwards. Ate 800 calories or less every day, and was never hungry. Had to remind myself to even eat.

Week 2: Had less cramps after the shot, same nausea. No other side effects, and these subsided by day two. Had slight bouts of modest hunger, just enough to eat a little consistently. Day seven I ate a hamburger.

Week 3. No side effects upon shot. Felt fine. Weirdly, day three I had a one-time case of nasty diarrhea. That passed and I was fine. I ate a bit more this week, hitting 1,200 calories on two days, but kept up my weight loss. Slight increase in hunger. Didn‚Äôt have to remind myself to eat, but hunger was minimal, just enough to eat a little and stop.

Week 4. Started week at 213.2 and ended week at 213.2. No idea why I lost no weight, but then literally the next day (day one of 5mg) I was down 2lbs. Whatever, progress is progress. No side effects, except that one-time diarrhea on day three. I was a tad hungry, enough to eat better at about 1,000 calories a day. Day six I ate a hamburger and fries, but only 1,300 calories the whole day. I wasn‚Äôt really hungry, I just knew I needed to eat something.

Tips and Tricks: 

Recommended by others on here but:

-Consume a lot of protein. Fairlife shakes are a lifesaver.
-Stick to bland foods. Dave‚Äôs killer bread is great because it‚Äôs loaded with fiber and protein. My burgers were just basic meat, lettuce, tomato, onion. Not ketchup with the fries, and they weren‚Äôt greasy. 
-Always eat a carb with a protein. This helps your body digest both better.
-Crackers help here. I got a big box of Ritz and just eat a few with some beef jerky or bone broth.
-Stick to small meals. 200 calories at a time. You will get full quickly. (I felt bloated and nausea after those burgers, but I needed the food)
-Consume fiber to keep things moving. I just bought a big pack of prunes from Costco. I also drink a lot of coffee.
-Be prepared for weird dreams. I suspect this is because the rapid weight loss puts your body in trauma mode. It‚Äôs worth it. Just recognize what the dreams mean and you‚Äôre fine.
-Pace yourself. Energy levels will be moderate to low. Don‚Äôt overdo anything, you will feel it quickly.

Most of all, enjoy the ride! This stuff works.

1mtism7,https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/1mtism7/building_a_localhost_oauth_callback_server_in/,Building a Localhost OAuth Callback Server in Node.js,"So I spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to figure out how to handle OAuth callbacks in a CLI tool I was building. Turns out the solution was simpler than I thought, but the implementation details were tricky enough that I figured I'd share what I learned.

The problem: you're building a CLI tool or desktop app that needs OAuth authentication. Your app needs to catch the authorization code when the OAuth provider redirects back, but you don't have a public server. The solution? Spin up a temporary localhost server to catch the redirect.

# The OAuth Callback Challenge

In a typical OAuth flow, the authorization server redirects to your callback URL with an authorization code. For web apps, that's easy - you have a public URL. But for CLI tools? You need to use [`http://localhost:3000/callback`](http://localhost:3000/callback) and actually catch that redirect somehow.

This is actually an official approach blessed by RFC 8252 (OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps). GitHub CLI uses it, Google's libraries use it, everyone uses it. But implementing it properly took me down quite a rabbit hole.

# Setting Up the HTTP Server

First challenge: making this work across Node.js, Deno, and Bun (because why not support everything, right?). I ended up abstracting the server behind a common interface using Web Standards APIs:

    interface CallbackServer {
      start(options: ServerOptions): Promise<void>;
      waitForCallback(path: string, timeout: number): Promise<CallbackResult>;
      stop(): Promise<void>;
    }
    
    function createCallbackServer(): CallbackServer {
      // Runtime detection - this was fun to figure out
      if (typeof Bun !== ""undefined"") return new BunCallbackServer();
      if (typeof Deno !== ""undefined"") return new DenoCallbackServer();
      return new NodeCallbackServer();
    }

For Node.js specifically, the tricky part was bridging between Node's old-school `http` module and the modern Web Standards Request/Response objects. Here's what worked:

    class NodeCallbackServer implements CallbackServer {
      private server?: http.Server;
      private callbackPromise?: {
        resolve: (result: CallbackResult) => void;
        reject: (error: Error) => void;
      };
    
      async start(options: ServerOptions): Promise<void> {
        const { createServer } = await import(""node:http"");
        
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          this.server = createServer(async (req, res) => {
            const request = this.nodeToWebRequest(req, options.port);
            const response = await this.handleRequest(request);
            
            res.writeHead(
              response.status,
              Object.fromEntries(response.headers.entries())
            );
            res.end(await response.text());
          });
    
          this.server.listen(options.port, options.hostname, resolve);
          this.server.on(""error"", reject);
        });
      }
    
      private nodeToWebRequest(req: http.IncomingMessage, port: number): Request {
        const url = new URL(req.url!, `http://localhost:${port}`);
        const headers = new Headers();
        
        for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(req.headers)) {
          if (typeof value === ""string"") {
            headers.set(key, value);
          }
        }
        
        return new Request(url.toString(), { 
          method: req.method, 
          headers 
        });
      }
    }

Once everything's converted to Web Standards, the actual request handling is the same everywhere, which is pretty neat.

# Capturing the Callback

The actual callback handler is straightforward, but don't forget to capture ALL the query parameters, not just the code:

    private async handleRequest(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
      const url = new URL(request.url);
      
      if (url.pathname === this.callbackPath) {
        const params: CallbackResult = {};
        
        // Get everything - you'll need state, error, error_description, etc.
        for (const [key, value] of url.searchParams) {
          params[key] = value;
        }
        
        // Resolve the waiting promise
        if (this.callbackPromise) {
          this.callbackPromise.resolve(params);
        }
        
        // Show the user something nice
        return new Response(this.generateSuccessHTML(), {
          status: 200,
          headers: { ""Content-Type"": ""text/html"" }
        });
      }
      
      return new Response(""Not Found"", { status: 404 });
    }

# The Timeout Trap I Fell Into

Here's where I lost a few hours. OAuth flows can fail in so many ways - users closing the browser, denying permissions, walking away to get coffee... You NEED proper timeout handling:

    async waitForCallback(path: string, timeout: number): Promise<CallbackResult> {
      this.callbackPath = path;
      
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let isResolved = false;
        
        const timer = setTimeout(() => {
          if (!isResolved) {
            isResolved = true;
            reject(new Error(`OAuth callback timeout after ${timeout}ms`));
          }
        }, timeout);
        
        // This wrapper pattern saved me from so many race conditions
        const wrappedResolve = (result: CallbackResult) => {
          if (!isResolved) {
            isResolved = true;
            clearTimeout(timer);
            resolve(result);
          }
        };
        
        this.callbackPromise = { 
          resolve: wrappedResolve, 
          reject: (error) => {
            if (!isResolved) {
              isResolved = true;
              clearTimeout(timer);
              reject(error);
            }
          }
        };
      });
    }

Also, if you're building a GUI app, support AbortSignal so users can cancel mid-flow:

    if (signal) {
      if (signal.aborted) {
        throw new Error(""Operation aborted"");
      }
      
      const abortHandler = () => {
        this.stop();
        if (this.callbackPromise) {
          this.callbackPromise.reject(new Error(""Operation aborted""));
        }
      };
      
      signal.addEventListener(""abort"", abortHandler);
    }

# Don't Leave Users Hanging

When the OAuth flow completes, users see a browser page. Make it useful! I learned this the hard way when a user sent me a screenshot of a blank page asking if it worked:

    function generateCallbackHTML(
      params: CallbackResult,
      templates: Templates
    ): string {
      if (params.error) {
        // Show them what went wrong
        return templates.errorHtml
          .replace(/{{error}}/g, params.error)
          .replace(/{{error_description}}/g, params.error_description || """");
      }
      
      // Success page - tell them they can close it!
      return templates.successHtml || `
        <html>
          <body style=""font-family: system-ui; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"">
            <h1>‚úÖ Authorization successful!</h1>
            <p>You can now close this window and return to your terminal.</p>
          </body>
        </html>
      `;
    }

# Security Gotchas

Some security things that bit me or others I've seen:

**1. ALWAYS bind to localhost, never 0.0.0.0:**

    this.server.listen(port, ""localhost""); // NOT ""0.0.0.0""!

**2. Validate that state parameter:**

    const state = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString(""base64url"");
    // ... later in callback
    if (params.state !== expectedState) {
      throw new Error(""State mismatch - possible CSRF attack"");
    }

**3. Kill the server immediately after getting the callback:**

    const result = await server.waitForCallback(""/callback"", 30000);
    await server.stop(); // Don't leave it running!

# Complete Working Example

Here's everything tied together:

    import { createCallbackServer } from ""./server"";
    import { spawn } from ""child_process"";
    
    export async function getAuthCode(authUrl: string): Promise<string> {
      const server = createCallbackServer();
      
      try {
        // Start server
        await server.start({
          port: 3000,
          hostname: ""localhost"",
          successHtml: ""<h1>Success! You can close this window.</h1>"",
          errorHtml: ""<h1>Error: {{error_description}}</h1>""
        });
        
        // Open browser (this works on Mac, Windows, and Linux)
        const opener = process.platform === ""darwin"" ? ""open"" :
                       process.platform === ""win32"" ? ""start"" : ""xdg-open"";
        spawn(opener, [authUrl], { detached: true });
        
        // Wait for the callback
        const result = await server.waitForCallback(""/callback"", 30000);
        
        if (result.error) {
          throw new Error(`OAuth error: ${result.error_description}`);
        }
        
        return result.code!;
        
      } finally {
        // ALWAYS clean up
        await server.stop();
      }
    }
    
    // Usage
    const code = await getAuthCode(
      ""https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?"" +
      ""client_id=xxx&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/callback""
    );

# Lessons Learned

After implementing this a few times, here's what I wish I knew from the start:

* Use Web Standards APIs even if you're Node-only - makes your code way more portable
* Handle ALL the edge cases - timeouts, cancellations, errors. Users will hit every single one
* Give users clear feedback in the browser - that success page matters
* State validation isn't optional - learned this during a security review
* Always clean up your servers - zombie processes are not fun to debug

This localhost callback approach works great for most OAuth providers. Some newer alternatives like Device Code Flow are nice for headless environments, and Dynamic Client Registration can eliminate the need for pre-shared secrets, but localhost callbacks are still the most widely supported approach.

**Questions for the community:**

* Anyone dealt with OAuth providers that don't support localhost redirects? How did you handle it?
* What's your approach for handling multiple simultaneous OAuth flows (like when your CLI is run in parallel)?
* Has anyone implemented PKCE with this approach? Worth the extra complexity?

Would love to hear about other people's OAuth implementation war stories. This stuff always seems simple until you actually build it!",3,1755514769.0,node,0,0.8,False

We‚Äôre out of the hospital! He had enterovirus, which caused his meningitis symptoms. Just wanted to give an update/tell you what happen d and let you know the story as it didn‚Äôt look like meningitis at all. I‚Äôm in the UK and last week was a heat wave, my baby was 8 weeks old, and was due to get his first round of vaccinations on Saturday, just to set the scene.

On Tuesday, my wife took him to a baby massage class, he got very hot in the car and had what looked like a heat rash all over his body. My wife immediately took him to a pharmacist, which was air conditioned, and they said it was heat rash as it was already going down, but to call a doctor if he went off his food and his behaviour changed.

On Wednesday, his rash came back, and over the course of the day he was very grumpy and off his food, so in the evening, my wife phoned 101 who told us to go into hospital just to check him out. The dr had a look at him and his rash blanched/went away when pressed, and following two failed cannula insertions, took some blood which came back showing infection markers. The dr initially thought it might be hand foot and mouth due to the rash being all over his body and on hands and feet,  but this then changed to sepsis once the blood tests came back, and then they kept us in overnight, when we then had the third failed cannula insertion. I went back to pack several bags and my wife stayed with him while he had an antibiotic injection. They did admit they were being over cautious purely because he was so young and was unvaccinated.

Thursday morning, free toast and coffee courtesy of the NHS (god bless them) and more results, potentially showing meningitis, and the consultant wanted to do a lumbar puncture to rule it out. We consented, and they took him off, advising us that we shouldn‚Äôt go with him as it is very distressing. He came back showing absolutely no signs of distress, just went to sleep with some cool plasters on his back. Shortly after that, we finally had a successful cannula insertion, but it had been difficult and lots of crying from all concerned, even the doctor who did it. He had antibiotics and antivirals. Blood tests still showed signs of infection, but it was starting to look like it would be viral, not bacterial meningitis, which was a positive update, and the consultant believed it might be enterovirus, but would need to lumbar puncture tests to come back. Stayed overnight again, with v broken sleep as he had his meds at 2am.

Friday morning, more lovely toast! First LP test came back, showing infection in his spinal fluid, so definitely meningitis, but would need more results to come back to determine the cause. More tests came back with markers for viral infection, and that it would eventually clear up on its own, but they couldn‚Äôt rule out bacterial until the final test came back, which wouldn‚Äôt be until Saturday. In the meantime, his cannula failed as it became kinked (the antiviral meds will do that, apparently) and he needed a new one, enter the first doctor who did the two failed cannulas on Wednesday. He got this one in on the first try! (No slight to him, apparently baby was quite shut down on Wednesday which is why the cannulas didn‚Äôt work)

Cue lots of waiting for results and another overnight stay, more toast, and then results came back Saturday showing that his culture from the lumbar puncture was negative for bacterial meningitis, but did have two bugs that were very strange and may be skin contaminants, and they needed to grow another culture to check, but they were happy for us to go home, he had one last push of antibiotics and took his cannula out.

On Sunday, we had a phone call confirming no bacterial meningitis and we were officially discharged, just need to have another blood test next week.

But the most important takeaway, his rash passed the glass test, but he still had meningitis, so if your child has a rash that passes the test, but isn‚Äôt their normal self and is off their food, please get them checked out.

Tl;dr - baby had rash all over their body, passed the glass test, but still had meningitis.",3,1755514575.0,daddit,0,0.8,False

But this [Philips Air Fryer 2000 Series (NA230/00)](https://www.amazon.in/Philips-NA230-00-Functions-Compact/dp/B0D8QN4C9X/tag=rahulbhatia-21) isn‚Äôt just another shiny gadget. It‚Äôs like that one reliable friend who does a bit of everything without being too extra.

First thing: it‚Äôs got **13 cooking functions**. Yup, thirteen. That means you‚Äôre not stuck with just fries and nuggets you can roast veggies, bake muffins, grill paneer, reheat yesterday‚Äôs pizza, and even toast bread. Basically, it‚Äôs a whole kitchen team packed into one compact black box.

What I really like is the **cooking window** you don‚Äôt have to play ‚Äúair fryer roulette‚Äù and wait nervously, hoping your food isn‚Äôt burnt. You can actually peek in and see what‚Äôs happening inside. Plus, it‚Äôs not bulky at all. At **6.6L capacity**, it‚Äôs big enough for a family batch of snacks but small enough to sit on your countertop without hogging all the space.

Of course, it‚Äôs Philips, so you‚Äôre getting their **RapidAir technology** basically, hot air swirls around the food to make it crispy outside and soft inside, without drowning it in oil. And since it‚Äôs **non-stick and easy to clean**, you‚Äôre not stuck scrubbing pans at 11 PM when all you want is Netflix and sleep.

Honestly? If you‚Äôre done juggling between oven, microwave, and frying pans, this one little machine could easily replace half of that.

  
**Curious? Peek at it here on Amazon and thank me later ‚Üí** [**Philips Air Fryer NA230/00**](https://www.amazon.in/Philips-NA230-00-Functions-Compact/dp/B0D8QN4C9X/tag=rahulbhatia-21)

# What I‚Äôve Actually Cooked in It (so far)

I hate reviews that only repeat the features, so let me tell you what I‚Äôve actually *tried and tested*:

* **French Fries & Potato Wedges** ‚Äì Crispy outside, fluffy inside. Took me 15 mins, no oil overdose.
* **Paneer Tikka** ‚Äì Marinated cubes turned out smoky and soft. Way better than my tawa version.
* **Garlic Bread** ‚Äì Legit bakery vibes in 8 minutes.
* **Frozen Nuggets & Momos** ‚Äì Lifesaver when I‚Äôm too lazy to cook. No soggy bottoms, thank god.
* **Reheated Pizza** ‚Äì Tastes like fresh-baked instead of chewy microwave sadness.

Next on my list: chocolate lava cake üëÄ (because yes, you can actually *bake* in this thing).

# Why it makes sense:

* **13-in-1 versatility** (so you‚Äôre not bored eating the same air-fried fries every day).
* **Cooking window** to check food mid-way (game changer if you‚Äôve ever burnt nuggets).
* **Compact 6.6L design** ‚Äî fits on your counter without making your kitchen feel like a gadget store.
* **Easy clean-up** ‚Äî the basket is non-stick, detachable, and dishwasher-safe.
* Backed by **Philips build quality** (these guys aren‚Äôt new to the game).

If you‚Äôre someone who likes experimenting in the kitchen but hates clutter, this thing is basically a lifesaver.

‚ú® **Pro tip**: It‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúbuy once, use daily‚Äù gadgets so even though Philips is slightly pricier than random brands, you‚Äôre paying for durability and trust.

1mtiikv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mtiikv,A War of Ideals: The Second American Civil War (1933 - 1938),"The year is 1933, and the United States of America is in the grip of the Great Depression, leaving millions of Americans unemployed, impoverished and in many cases, homeless. In our own history, the inauguration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt as the 32nd President of the United States marked the beginning of policy implementations that sought to confront the root causes of the Depression and bring America back to a state of economic stability, enough that it was able to sustain itself as it entered World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941. However, in this timeline, the economic crisis sparks the rise of political ideologies that exist outside the generally ‚Äòacceptable‚Äô American political spectrum - namely the American Communist Party (which in our timeline was present but never entered mainstream politics due to being too small) and the American Fascist Party, which capitalised on the economic downturn like Hitler‚Äôs own National Socialist Party was doing in Germany. 

Gaining prominence throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s, both parties - supporting the Soviet Union and the German Third Reich respectively - pushed for societal reform on opposite sides of the political spectrum, whereas more traditionally-minded politicians advocated for combatting the Depression and re-establishing American prosperity through more traditional politics. Gradually, fringe elements of the Democratic and Republican parties eventually broke off to join the Communists or Fascists, with the remaining elements from both ‚Äòold guard‚Äô parties merging to create the Unified Party of America. While attempts to resolve the ever-mounting tension between the three factions through the federal election of 1932 seemed promising, a series of bloody clashes between Communists and Fascists as well as Unified crackdown against both of their rivals eventually resulted in representatives for all three factions carving out segments of the American nation into their own territories composed of loyalist states. The Unified Party continued to utilise the American flag and the name The United States of America, whereas the Communists founded the United Socialist Republics of America and the Fascists formed the American Empire from its loyalist states and territories with substantial US presence (Puerto Rico, etc.) that still clung to America‚Äôs colonialist past. 

The resulting three-way civil war raged for five years, ultimately ending in 1938 with the destruction of two parties‚Äô leadership at the Battle of Washington DC and a new beginning for America. Whichever of the three states - liberal, communist or fascist - won the war would determine America‚Äôs future even as Europe inched ever-closer to war between the Allies and the Axis powers‚Ä¶ and whatever path America took could potentially determine the fate of the rest of the world. 

I‚Äôm leaving the war‚Äôs victor open-ended for a reason - share your thoughts on what happens next? Does America remain a democratic republic? Does it become a communist state, or embrace fascism? And how does this affect the nation‚Äôs future going forward into World War II and beyond?    ",3,1755513826.0,AlternateHistory,0,1.0,False

I never had a tipical ""guy best friend"", just male friends whom i weren't ""besties"" with. About 5 years ago i met my now ex, and i became a part of his friendgroup, this is how i met A (21 Male) and D (23? Male). Both are still good friends of mine, even after i broke up with my ex (A and D left the friendgroup later, not because of me and my ex separating). D is fine, he has a lot of issues and he loves to yap to me about everything. A on the other hand is more introverted with most people, We used to talk more on discord but i don't use discord anymore. Now he only messages me when he wants to meet up. Which is fine by me, i can meet the needs of different types of friends. Here comes the problem. A is a very affectionate person with those he truly trusts and i'm one of the very few. We share some core values and it's very peaceful to be around him. I created a safe space for him over the years so he expresses his feelings to me and this lead to him developing feelings towards me that i don't reciprocate. I know he has feelings for me cause he made innapropriate jokes about us MULTIPLE times. He hugs me a little too long. He looks at me the way you shouldn't look at a friend. I laugh it off but idk what to do. I like him as a person. I value the time we spend together but i've grown more and more uncomfortable with each meet up. These meetups are 1-3 months apart. We meet for coffee, or we drive around in his car, i designed multiple of his tattoos for him and drew them on his arm. I like him PLATONICALLY and i act the same way with him as i would with any other good friend. It breaks my heart but i feel uncomfortable around him, fearing that he'll make a move on me any second. I have a boyfriend, who i'm very happy and in love with. My bf knows about A, he knows every detail, we are secure in our relationship, he is understandably kinda pissed at A. He wants to help but he said that this is not his place to decide or say anything. A has a girl collegue who he tells me he likes but idk how serious he is with her. I know it'd be best to just cut him off completely but it's hard to let go of a 5 year friendship just like that. I have to come to terms with the fact that he doesn't view our friendship the way i do. I know everything i need to do but letting go is hard as hell. 
Today he asked me if i want to meet up one more time before i start my next semester at uni, cause i'll be 3-4 hours away. We met 3 times already since may. I felt sick when i saw his text. I haven't replied to him. Idk how to go about this, any advice would be nice.",3,1755513131.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

The phin filter makes it strong but balanced, and iced with condensed milk (*c√† ph√™ s·ªØa ƒë√°*) is such a game changer in this heat.

Curious, has anyone else here tried it? Do you prefer it hot, iced, or even as a cold brew twist?",6,1755512813.0,UAE,3,0.87,False
