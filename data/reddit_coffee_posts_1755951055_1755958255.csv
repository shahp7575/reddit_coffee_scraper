1my2guc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1my2guc,Week 34: Chocolate Hazelnut Biscotti,"Easy enough to assemble. Did all that last night, baked this morning.
Baked for 12 minutes, then tried cutting. They were a little crumbly and hard to get good slices. Guess next time I'll go the full 15 to start.
Baked for 10 for the second go, but they were still a little soft in the center so I added 5 minutes. Not sure if that was a good idea or not. I had a feeling they'd crisp up while cooking but didn't know how much 

Son commented on its crunchiness but he's a Rube and not down with biscotti. 

Offered one to my wife, immediately met with ""these aren't sourdough, are they?"" Still scarred from the crackers I guess.Wife said she got one bite with the taste of cigarette ashes, otherwise thought they were good.

 I had one with coffee and thought they were good  

Would make again if I had hazelnuts in the house. Doubt id drop $8 on them otherwise ",1,1755958201.0,BakingSchoolBakeAlong,0,1.0,False

**August 23, 2025 | 8:11 PM ET**

The Toronto Blue Jays (-131) are here to flex their .267 team batting average and 4.22 ERA, while the Miami Marlins (+111) will try to avoid becoming the first team to lose 70 games this season. Let’s break it down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a ballpark hot dog vendor.

---

### Why the Jays Should Win

* **Jose Berrios (4.00 ERA)** takes the mound, a man who’s as reliable as a coffee maker on a Monday morning. Opposing batters have a .238 OBP against him—good for *last place in the AL*.
* **Bo Bichette** and **Vladimir Guerrero Jr.** are both hitting .298, a duo so consistent they could time-share a batting title. Their ""Over 0.5 doubles"" prop is -240 and -230, respectively. *Buy the farm, they’ll hit the corral.*
* Toronto’s offense averages 4.9 runs per game, while Miami’s pitching staff surrenders 4.53. Math lesson: **4.9 > 4.53**.

---

### Why the Marlins Might Not

* **Janson Junk** (4.79 ERA) starts for Miami, a pitcher who’s allowed 1.2 HRs per 9 innings. That’s like

1my2f81,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1my2f81/positive_60_day_update/,Positive 60 day update,"Had bad withdrawal symptoms. Terrible anxiety, panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, nightmares, brain fog  that felt like it was just constant. Really felt like it peaked at 2-3 weeks and I thought I was losing it cause I didn’t even correlate it to the zyns. 

This last week I’ve had a huge reduction in all symptoms. Can get through work without constant brain fog. When I wake up on the weekends I don’t feel the immediate anxiety when my minds not occupied. Can actually enjoy some things I used to etc.

So to not ramble there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I may not even be out of the water yet but I can see that this is getting better. Progress is not linear I’ve had  times of good days before this followed by a couple bad days. But overall it is upwards progression the longer you go.

If you are really struggling 
1. Cut off caffeine , switch to decaf coffee or cut it out completely this will lessen anxiety by a huge margin

2. Exercise intensely. Not just a weight lifting workout. High intensity workout like boxing pad work will really help to get you a couple hours of peace. Also really long walks or low intensity workout are beneficial too if you’re unable. I also feel like this will speed up recovery.

3. Stop drinking —self explanatory 

4. Not sure about this but constantly eating. I think blood sugar is affected in withdrawal and I just felt better after a big meal. Used to fast a lot but eating 3 square meals I felt helped me out 

Much love to anyone out there going through this. A lot of this sub seems to have a way easier time quitting for whatever reason, so for the other half of people you are not alone, you’re not going crazy, and you’re gonna get better. Progress is a slow process but again it is upwards progression!!

1my2dzw,https://i.redd.it/juzxdsbo0skf1.jpeg,Could ptosis still be a symptom if you’re able to use your forehead muscles to lift your eye?,"Hello all!  
Not diagnosed, but have been suffering with symptoms and assessed for stroke three separate times now. MRIs done to rule out MS. 

I am able to use my forehead muscles to lift my eye. At least in the first half of the day. 

It results in horrible tension like headaches towards the evening, when my forehead muscles seem to just give up. 

Though I also have cervical spinal issues so that also may be cerviogenic headache. 


Symptoms include vertical double vision, seems to switch eyes. 
Went to my ophthalmologist, was sent to a specialist. 

Cleared by both. 

The worst symptom by far is the muscle weakness and fatigue. Sometimes even lifting my coffee pot is too much. Sometimes I feel exactly how coming down with Covid felt. 

I know some of you must be so sick of “do I have MG?” posts, and I apologize. 

It’s just I have been written off by several doctors so often while trying to figure out what is going on with me. 

I finally have an appointment with a new neurologist in a few weeks and I just don’t want to come off as a hypochondriac, someone that diagnosed themselves via Dr. Google. 

I just want to get this right. 

Thank you all so much.

Ideal room:

* A room with a private bathroom
* Budget: prefer to keep it \~$1,750, but have flexibility (since I know the private bathroom might be tricky). 
* Location: ideally UES, Astoria, or LIC, but pretty open to any place with good transit options. Bonus if it’s easy access to broadway 

As a roommate:

* I work remotely in research and policy so will WFH often, though I may spend a good portion of it working at coffee shops
* Very respectful of boundaries and on the chill, quiet side, but also happy to socialize. Will not be bringing parties back home. 
* Prioritize cleanliness!!! no shoes indoors, no dirty dishes overnight etc. I’m looking for someone who is also good about keeping common areas clean. 
* No pets and would prefer to live with no pets

Hello, I'd like some help with my studio. I just moved and I hate it. It's cramped, yet not cozy. I'm very sensitive to ""feng shui"" or whatever my OCD's perception of it is. Doors and windows are evil and monsters will get me. I wonder if there are simple fixes I'm blind to or if the more advanced feng shui things I know nothing about (earth and fire and all that) might convince my paranoid brain that it's alright.

I don't love that my desk faces the kitchen, but I don't see anywhere else it can face. I had one of my tall shelves in front of the desk briefly - the hallway is huge enough for it - and felt claustrophobic, so I don't think covering the view would help.

I need the two shelves (and could use another shelf too) behind the desk for work stuff, and the treadmill is also non negotiable. All the beige rectangles are various tiny storage pieces - stools and bookshelves.

>I've thought about removing the couch and making the bed into a makeshift Daybed (it fits \*perfectly\* and does not allow room for a headboard or any crazy DIY) with some pillows against the wall, and having a shelf / coffee table and ottoman where the large couch is for a little living room. That way I could theoretically still have people over. I remember hating not having a couch, but it's not like I use it much now, so I don't know.

The window is floor to ceiling and I keep the blinds closed for privacy, but it still makes me uncomfortable so I'd like to add another divider or something there. 

The other option is to change things around and have the office occupy the larger space where the bed/couch currently are. More room for shelving I didn't want to do that because the idea of my desk facing the treadmill stresses me out and I'm not sure if my bed in that corner would feel any nicer.

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Figure Out Why Anyone Pours Coffee on a Fire*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Toes**  
The betting markets are as split as a tangerine at a Spanish market. Both teams hover around **36-38% implied probability** to win, with the draw at **\~34%** (thanks to those 2.65-2.75 odds). The under-2.5 goals line is a **63-65% favorite**, suggesting bookmakers expect a defensive duel. If you’re betting on chaos, the “Over” is a 37% shot—about the same chance as your Uncle Javier remembering to bring his phone charger on a road trip.

**Key Stats:**

* **Ceuta**: Newly promoted, 0 shots on target in their 3-0 loss to Valladolid. Their attack is like a toaster trying to brew coffee—present, but utterly useless.
* **Sporting Gijón**: Ninth consecutive LaLiga season, but just 4 training sessions after an **8-hour, 1,000km journey** involving land, air, and sea. Their fitness coach probably has a second job as a therapist.

**Digesting the News: Ghosts, Ghosts Everywhere**  
**AD Ceuta** is playing in a stadium that hasn’t hosted a professional game in **57 years**. The grass is probably haunted by the ghosts of 1944, when their last meeting with Sporting ended 1-1. Their recent performance? A 3-0 drubbing where they failed to register a single shot on target. If football were a movie, Ceuta’s season would be titled *The Silence of the Lambs… of the Lambs Who Can’t Score*.

**Sporting Gijón**, meanwhile, is trying to channel the magic of their 2020-21 era under David Gallego (who led them to consecutive wins). But their current squad is missing Kevin Vázquez (injured) and faces a logistical nightmare: a tea

Everybody has pest control contracts.  No matter how spotless your house is, when there’s too much rain or the weather turns cool the ants come in by the thousands.  

So a few days ago ants showed up in the bedroom cabinet where I keep my meds.   I keep my dog’s meds and Pill Pockets on the same shelf and I guess that the Pill Pockets attracted them.   Anyway, I put out borax for the ants, moved Buddy’s meds to the kitchen and put mine on top of the dresser, throwing a wrench into my routine. 

Just before waking up today (Saturday) I had one of those gut-wrenching nightmares.  It had elements of my life over several decades mixed up to appeal to all my fears: can’t find my car in a parking lot, couldn’t figure out how to make calls on an ancient flip phone, going down a road I used everyday but the landmarks were suddenly gone, all of that.   At one point I even thought, this makes no sense, I’m having a dream, I’ve got to wake up.  By the end I was convinced I was rapidly sinking into dementia.

Finally my cat woke me up (thanks, Lucy) and it took me a full minute to figure out where I was.  After some hastily-nuked leftover coffee I went to grab my morning meds and get them into my brain asap.     And there were my dose-packs, which come labeled by day, date and time to be taken.  The next two were **Friday AM** and Friday PM.   My interrupted routine had caused me to take an unexpected drug holiday, which is not a good plan for a diabetic on several psych meds.   No wonder I was having brain zaps!!!

Not that I expect you to keep track, but I’m the same person who posted that I took Buddy’s allergy pill one day. That prompted me to put my pills in a green tote and his in a red tote, but obviously a better backup plan is called for.

My mornings now start with the tantalizing aroma of espresso filling the kitchen, courtesy of this sleek and modern machine. With its Piano Black finish and stainless steel accents, this espresso machine doesn’t just brew; it adds a touch of sophistication to my countertop.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Who doesn’t love a kitchen gadget that looks as good as it performs? This coffee maker boasts clean lines and a modern aesthetic, making it more than just functional—it’s an eye-catcher. It’s larger than some other machines I’ve used, with dimensions of 17.7""D x 23.9""W x 18.4""H, but it sits comfortably in its designated corner. Weighing about 30.2 pounds, it feels robust and well-constructed. The integrated coffee grinder and glass milk container included with the bundle make it feel more comprehensive, though the size could be a concern for those tight on space.

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Here’s where the magic happens. The six-level Aroma G3 Grinder impressed me with its fast and precise grinding capabilities, delivering fresh coffee grounds noticeably faster than other grinders I’ve tried. Every shot of espresso and cappuccino has been top-notch, with a bold aroma and flavor. Jura’s Pulse Extraction Process (P.E.P.) ensures even the shortest espresso shots pack intensity and depth. The layer of milk foam, thanks to the innovative Fine Foam Technology, is the cherry—or foam—on top. Whether it's a latte macchiato or a cappuccino, the result is barista-grade at home. However, I did notice the process can be slightly noisier than expected, particularly in the early hours.

**Ease of Use**  
The color TFT display with assigned buttons for cappuccino, espresso, coffee, and milk foam makes navigating this machine delightfully simple. It’s a breeze even for those who might otherwise dig out the manual for every operation. Adding to the convenience is the Intelligent Water System (IWS) with RFID technology, which simplifies filter usage. I’m not the best at tracking maintenance, and this feature has been a game-changer. Unfortunately, cleaning and descaling can still feel like a chore, especially with multiple parts involved, but it’s manageable.

[Check Jura 15400_K1 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07ycx1468/)  

**Advantages**  
There’s a lot to love about this espresso machine.  
- The Aroma G3 Grinder delivers fresh, dual-speed grinding.  
- Pulse Extraction Process enriches even the shortest coffee shots.  
- Fine Foam Technology crafts feather-light milk froth.  

**Shortcomings**  
Of course, no product is perfect, and I’d be remiss not to mention these:  
- Cleaning and descaling require effort due to multiple parts.  
- Slightly noisy operation during early morning brewing.

I compared this model to a few competitors, including the Breville Barista Pro and the Gaggia Anima Prestige. While the Jura stands out with its superior grinder speed and advanced extraction method (thanks to P.E.P.), the Breville offers a more hands-on approach that might appeal to true espresso aficionados. The Gaggia, on the other hand, edges out slightly in compactness and affordability but lacks the refined milk frothing capability I’ve appreciated here. Those seeking automation and seamless coffee preparation will gravitate toward the Jura.

**Quality for Price**  
This isn’t a budget buy, that’s for sure. However, the combination of features, automation, and premium coffee preparation justifies the cost for serious coffee lovers. It’s an investment piece, delivering morning after morning of unparalleled coffee quality right from the comfort of home. Less frequent trips to the coffee shop have also made it feel like a cost-effective choice in the long run.

We see lots of posts of people struggling and commenters commiserating and giving advice

I'd love to start a little thread of people overcoming those hard times proactively. Having a baby is no easy feat! A bit of love, calm, and redirecting goes a long way 

So, what's a challenge you've come across that you managed to make the most of? What frustrating situations have you turns into happy little memories with a deep breath and intention?

I'll go first. Some nights are just hard. Some mornings baby is up before sunrise and despite our best efforts he is staying up. Wanting to lay in bed and melt into despair is my first thought. 

But hubby always suggests a breakfast date. We climb our tired little souls out of bed and get to the coffee shop just as doors open. We eat a yummy pastry, drink good coffee, and watch our amazing baby smile and babble at every sleepy person who walks through the door. He makes their day which makes our day. And suddenly a difficult start becomes a lovely morning.

1my22p1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundShape/comments/1my22p1/explore_if_the_best_wireless_headphones_by_sony/,Explore if the Best Wireless Headphones by Sony CH520 Are Worth It,"Testing the Sony WH-CH520 felt like stepping into the world of seamless wireless audio. These headphones immediately caught my attention due to their simple yet stylish design, resembling a chic combo of functionality and elegance. With promises of long-lasting battery life and advanced noise-canceling features, I was curious to see how they'd hold up in everyday activities, from work calls to outdoor jogs. Having spent weeks with these headphones glued to my ears, here’s a no-nonsense rundown of where they shine and where they trip up.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me was how lightweight these on-ear headphones are—just 5.2 ounces. Taking it out of the box, I genuinely thought something was missing because it felt feather-light. This is excellent for extended listening sessions, and the adjustable headband and soft ear pads further enhance the comfort. While the predominantly plastic material makes them weigh next to nothing, it also feels a bit fragile. I wouldn’t attempt tossing these casually into my backpack without a case. They do have an angular on-ear design that fits snugly around my ears without making them feel like they’re cooking in an oven, even after hours of use.

**Battery Life and Charging**  
A strong point of the WH-CH520 is the beastly 50-hour battery life. Believe me, I pushed this claim to its fullest by forgetting to charge them for an entire week, and they still had juice left for roughly two days! The quick-charge feature, which delivers 1.5 hours of playback from just three minutes of charging, saved my day during an impromptu gaming night. This makes them perfect for long travel days or binge-watching sessions. However, I did notice that the USB Type-C cable included in the box is quite short—not the most convenient if your outlets are hard to reach.  

**[Check Sony WH-CH520 price on Amazon.](https://visionhut.com/p/b0bzpk3xfq/)**  

**Audio Quality for the Everyday Listener**  
Listening to my favorite tracks with the WH-CH520 was nothing short of satisfying. The addition of the Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE) impressed me by restoring more detail, especially in older tracks, where higher frequencies are often muted. Admittedly, these headphones aren't audiophile-grade, but for everyday use like YouTube binging, casual gaming, or a quick workout playlist, they're more than capable. The Sony Headphones Connect app adds a nice customization touch, letting me tweak the EQ settings to my liking. If you’re gaming or watching movies, the sound clarity and balance between bass and treble are decent, albeit not mind-blowingly dynamic.

**Call Quality and Noise Control**  
Taking calls on these headphones is a breeze. I’ve used them during noisy coffee shop visits and busy office meetings, and the noise-canceling mic worked wonders. It minimized background clamor to the point that colleagues often heard me clearer than when I used my laptop mic. Active noise cancellation for calls is definitely a standout feature, though don’t expect full silence like on high-end noise-canceling headphones. Ambient sounds still creep in a little during quieter exchanges.

**Upsides**  
- Extremely lightweight and comfortable, even for hours.  
- Impressive Bluetooth multipoint connection makes switching between devices seamless.  
- Long-lasting 50-hour battery life is unbeatable in this price range.  
- Quick charging comes in handy during last-minute needs.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The plastic build feels fragile and less premium than expected.  
- Noise cancellation isn't as robust for handling loud environments.  
- The short USB Type-C cable feels like a missed opportunity for better practicality.  

**Controller Features and Connectivity**  
For those worried about fiddling with their phones constantly, fear not. Controlling volume, switching tracks, or activating voice assistants is intuitive via the simple buttons on the ear cups. I appreciated the inclusion of Bluetooth 5.2, which provided a reliable connection across my laptop, smartphone, and even my smart TV. The range is solid too—I wandered to the next room mid-call, and the audio stream didn’t stutter. However, they could’ve gone the extra mile with USB-A and Bluetooth setup guidance right in the user manual for the less tech-savvy.

**Product Alternatives**  
Comparing the WH-CH520 with competitors like the JBL TUNE 510BT or Anker Soundcore Life Q20 is inevitable. While JBL provides a bit more punch in the bass department, Sony’s WH-CH520 outshines them in terms of battery life and comfort. Anker’s Q20, on the other hand, offers a better noise-canceling experience but feels bulkier, making Sony's lightweight nature a win for those on the move. That said, if you're a bass head or want near-perfect noise isolation, you might lean toward those alternatives. But the WH-CH520 excels as an all-rounder, especially for users looking for something versatile and lightweight.

**True Value**  
Given everything these headphones offer, I’d argue they strike a great balance of affordability and quality. Yes, they fall short in a few areas compared to pricier alternatives, but their sheer comfort, customizability with the app, and battery life make them worth every penny. Unless you're super particular about supreme noise-canceling or shelling out for expensive premium options, the WH-CH520 delivers solid bang for the buck without much compromise.

1my22fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1my22fs/discover_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_by/,Discover if the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker by Bella Delivers,"Testing out the BELLA Single Serve Coffee Maker, I was more than curious to see if its claims of versatility and convenience actually stood up to the daily grind (pun intended). Being a coffee enthusiast, I’ve cycled through countless coffee makers over the years, but this compact machine brings something unique to the table. Its simplicity in a world of overly complicated gadgets was honestly refreshing. Let me break down my experience with this brewer.

**Design and Build**  
This coffee maker is sleek, lightweight, and doesn’t hog counter space—a dream come true for anyone dealing with a tiny kitchen or cluttered workspace. The design seems intentionally minimalistic, catering to those of us who don't want a spaceship taking over our countertops. The adjustable drip tray that accommodates travel mugs up to 7 inches tall? That’s not just a minor detail; it’s a lifesaver for busy mornings when I’m rushing out with coffee in hand. The 14oz water tank mirrors the compact nature of the machine but still manages to serve casual coffee drinkers well. If aesthetics matter to you, its understated oatmilk color blends smoothly rather than screaming for attention.

**Performance and Customization**  
The performance side impressed me. Brewing from 6oz to 14oz, it lets you customize your coffee size, which is ideal if you’re like me and oscillate between strong pick-me-up shots and leisurely large cups. Though it’s not lightning fast, the brewing speed is what I would call ""morning-acceptable."" One major highlight? The flexibility of using either coffee grounds or pods. I particularly enjoyed experimenting with different ground coffee blends, but I’ve also had mornings where popping in a quick pod was all I had time for. The customizable experience is a win in my book.

[See BELLA Single Serve Coffee Maker deals on Amazon now.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b0cyj6xt9s/)

**Ease of Use**  
The BELLA coffee maker is undoubtedly simple to operate—one-touch brewing means there’s no steep learning curve. Even tech-challenged folks in my house managed to use it seamlessly. Last weekend, my aunt—who still struggles to send a text message—had zero trouble brewing her morning cup when she stayed over. The straightforward controls deliver exactly what it promises without excess complication.

**Upsides**  
- Compact, space-saving design ideal for small kitchens.  
- Adjustable drip tray perfectly fits travel mugs.  
- Brew customization from 6oz to 14oz for various coffee needs.  
- Allows for both pods and ground coffee to suit any preference.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The water tank capacity, while decent for single-serve use, requires frequent refills for households with multiple coffee drinkers.  
- It's a bit noisier than I expected during the brewing process.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
When it comes to cleanup, this coffee maker really shines. I didn’t dread the aftermath of my morning coffee ritual because all removable parts are dishwasher-safe. From the reusable filter to the drip tray and even the coffee pod adapter, everything is incredibly easy to pop into the dishwasher. For moments when I couldn’t spare time for a full cleanup (a.k.a. most mornings), a simple rinse was sufficient, thanks to its thoughtful design.

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing the BELLA Single Serve Coffee Maker with others like the Keurig K-Mini or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, I noticed a few things. The Keurig K-Mini also has compact dimensions but lacks the adjustable drip tray for taller mugs, which is a standout feature here. On the other hand, the FlexBrew shares similar multifunctionality (pods and grounds) but leans toward slightly bulkier dimensions. Where this product wins is its ideal balance between compact design and optimal functionality, though the competitors feel a touch sturdier in terms of build.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Given the features packed into this little machine, it’s priced reasonably compared to its industry rivals. While it’s not going to dethrone higher-end coffee machines with advanced settings and bigger tanks, it delivers excellent value for single-serve coffee lovers who prioritize hassle-free operation. Even my coffee-loving coworker, who’s notorious for declaring anything cheaper than $200 ""inferior,"" ended up appreciating what this machine brings to the table.

1my20lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedAndRated/comments/1my20lh/explore_the_best_toaster_oven_air_fryer_our_place/,Explore the Best Toaster Oven Air Fryer Our Place Wonder Oven Worth It?,"The Our Place Wonder Oven immediately caught my eye because I’ve had my fair share of toaster ovens that promise multifunctionality but often leave me disappointed. This one, boasting a 6-in-1 feature set including air frying, toasting, roasting, baking, reheating, and broiling, seemed like it might be a serious contender. After using it for a month to prepare everything from crispy salmon filets to fluffy banana bread, I can confidently say it has some strong features worth discussing, though there are trade-offs to consider as well.

**Remarkable Design and Space-Friendly Build**

The first thing that stood out was the compact and sleek design. Living in a tiny apartment with limited counter space means every inch counts. The Wonder Oven, at 10.6 inches deep, 11.5 inches wide, and 11.6 inches tall, fit snugly between my coffee machine and cutting board holder without feeling cramped. I even tested its capacity by roasting a 4.5-pound chicken—which surprisingly fit! That alone impressed me. Its painted finish and stainless steel door add a modern touch that complements almost any kitchen style. 

Despite its small footprint, the unit doesn’t feel cheap, weighing in at a solid 11.6 pounds. The knobs are intuitive, although I did have moments of over-twisting, which made me wish they clicked into precise settings. But hey, a little manual adjustment now and then isn’t the end of the world.

**Revolutionary Steam Infusion for Perfect Moisture**

What really set this apart, and I mean significantly, is the steam infusion technology. I’m used to dry chicken breasts from my air fryer or toaster oven. With this steam feature, I cooked a batch of chicken thighs, and the results were game-changing. The meat was juicy, and the aroma from the infused steam surprised my sibling visiting for dinner. Even baking, which can dry out quickly, turned out great—that banana bread had a golden crust yet stayed moist inside. This feature alone is a standout, truly locking in flavors you wouldn’t expect from a machine this size.

**Fast Preheating and Cooking**

Time is money—especially when every meal feels like a race against the clock. Whether toasting bagels or roasting veggies, this oven’s rapid preheat feature saved me endless minutes. It claims to heat 75% faster than traditional ovens, and I believe it. My previous countertop toaster required what felt like ages to get up to temperature, but with this one, dinner prep on chaotic weekdays felt less rushed. It can reach up to 450°F, which makes it versatile enough for pizza, cookies, and more.

That said, your food can burn quickly if you’re not monitoring closely. During one experiment with fries, I left the preset settings as is, assuming it’d do the job flawlessly, and accidentally overcooked them. While its efficiency cuts down cooking time, you need to keep an eye on your food, or it’s easy to make mistakes.

**Key Benefits**

- Versatile 6-in-1 design enables air frying, toasting, roasting, and baking in one unit.  
- Compact size maximizes counter space while still accommodating medium-sized meals.  
- Steam infusion technology results in moist, flavorful dishes with better textures.  

**Limitations**

- Noisy operation when steam technology is activated—might annoy some users.  
- Learning curve with manual knob controls; precise adjustments could be challenging.  

**Comparison to Peer Products**

I’ve used competitors like the Ninja Foodi Digital Air Fry Oven and Breville Smart Oven Air, and they each have their strengths. While the Ninja offers a sleek flip-away option for saving counter space, it lacks the steam infusion that the Wonder Oven excels in. On the other hand, the Breville offers greater precision in temperature control via digital settings, but it feels bulky and needs extra space.

The Wonder Oven may not have every bell and whistle of its competitors, but it hits a sweet spot in versatility and space-saving design. Its steam feature, in particular, is a game-changer for someone like me who prefers home-cooked meals that taste closer to restaurant-quality.

**Quality for Price**

When considering the price point, I found it fairly reasonable given its unique features. Yeah, there are cheaper toaster ovens on the market, but this does more than your average toaster or air fryer. You’re essentially paying for multifunctionality and innovative steam cooking. Seeing how much time and effort it’s saved me, I think it’s an excellent investment for its versatility and performance.

From my early morning workout routines to those late-night Netflix binges, these earbuds have almost become an extension of me. I’ve used tons of earbuds over the years, but these have surprised me in both good and not-so-great ways, which I’m excited to share.

**Design and Comfort**  
If you’re a fan of earbuds with some over-ear security, you’ll likely appreciate what these offer. The ear hooks are flexible and soft, ensuring a snug fit during those high-energy activities. I wore them during a long run under the blazing sun, and unlike other earbuds, they didn’t constantly need readjustment. The inclusion of three different sizes of ear caps is handy too; my partner swapped to the smaller set and found them just as comfy. We both agreed that the lightweight design (they barely register at 0.1 kilograms) makes them almost unnoticeable when in use. However, for folks who strictly prefer minimal in-ear buds without hooks, this might not be their thing.

**Wireless Features and Connectivity**  
Let’s talk tech. The Bluetooth 5.4 technology ensures a fast connection, and I noticed very minimal latency when streaming audio or taking calls. Pairing was seamless with my Android phone and my friend’s iPhone—it even remembers your device when you open the charging case. I tested the 15-meter range claim by wandering into the kitchen while leaving my phone in the living room. The connection held strong without interruptions. However, if walls are thick or there’s interference, you might see slight stutters.

**[Check OYIB S75 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0d5vjljgs/)**  

**Battery Life and Charging Time**  
For someone constantly on the go, battery life can make or break a product for me. A single charge delivered about 10 hours of playtime, and when I popped them back into the charging case, it extended usage to an impressive 50 hours in total. This was game-changing during a weekend camping trip where outlets weren’t readily available. Charging via USB-C also felt fast compared to older earbuds with micro-USB ports. The LED digital display on the charging case was a lifesaver, showing the exact battery percentage. It’s a feature I didn’t realize I needed until I had it.

**Sound Quality and Calling Experience**  
Here’s where the OYIB S75 really shines. The 13mm double-layer diaphragm drivers produce audio with rich bass, clear mids, and crisp treble. I queued up my favorite playlist, and the depth of the sound caught me off guard. EDM tracks had that pulsing low-end I crave, and acoustic tracks felt alive. Calls were decent too—the ENC mic filtered out surrounding noise during a chaotic coffee shop meeting. My colleague, who I called during this test, couldn’t even tell I was in a public space. That said, audiophiles might feel the high notes lack the clarity you get with higher-end earbuds.

**Durability and Waterproofing**  
Ever dropped your gadget and felt your heart sink? I sure did when these slipped off the bench during a sweaty workout. No scratches, no issues— they practically laughed at my panic. The IP7 waterproof rating allowed me to trust them on rainy runs or during gym sessions drenched in sweat. While I wouldn’t recommend throwing them into a pool, they’re great for everyday waterproof scenarios.

**Ease of Use with Smart Touch Controls**  
Touch controls are hit or miss for me, but the OYIB S75 earbuds proved functional. A light tap would adjust the volume, skip tracks, or handle phone calls. My only gripe was during high-energy workouts when I accidentally paused music while repositioning the buds. It’s a learning curve, but once you get used to the precise touch points, it becomes natural.

**Assets**  
- Secure and lightweight fit, perfect for sports or long use.  
- Impressive sound depth and vivid audio quality.  
- Battery longevity with a handy digital display.  
- Water-resistant build ideal for workouts or outdoor activities.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Touch controls can be overly sensitive during sweaty sessions.  
- The high treble might not satisfy hardcore audiophiles.  
- Ear hook design might not appeal to minimalists.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing these earbuds to well-known names like Beats Powerbeats or Jabra Elite versions revealed a few things. The Powerbeats might offer slightly punchier bass, but they’re also heavier, which led to ear fatigue over time. Similarly, while Jabra Elite earbuds provide tighter noise cancellation, the OYIB S75 outperformed them in battery life, not to mention a significantly lower price point. For budget-conscious gadget lovers, these earbuds strike a solid balance between affordability and functionality.

**Affordable Quality**  
For someone who enjoys high-tech gadgets but also loves saving a buck or two, these earbuds deliver. Without breaking the bank, you’re getting good sound quality, stellar battery life, and an ergonomic fit—all dressed in sleek black. While they’re not perfect, their set features justify the cost for most casual users or fitness enthusiasts.

I’ve been reading a bunch of articles and “top 10” style guides online about whitening toothpaste, but honestly none of them felt very convincing. A lot of them seem like ads rather than real advice, so I figured I’d ask here directly: what’s the best whitening toothpaste reddit users actually recommend?

A bit about me: I’m 31, drink coffee every morning, and I also have the bad habit of sipping tea throughout the day, so staining is kind of inevitable. I brush twice a day, floss most nights (not perfect, but I try), and I don’t smoke. My dentist mentioned my enamel is a little sensitive, so I don’t want anything super harsh that’ll make things worse.

I tried a couple of the “popular” options that blogs push, but after a few months I didn’t notice much change. That’s why I’m not satisfied with those guides and would rather hear from people here who’ve actually seen results.

What’s worked for you? Any specific routines or tips that make the whitening toothpaste more effective?

Thanks in advance for any honest input.",5,1755956491.0,hygiene,7,1.0,False
1my1s0w,https://i.redd.it/84iqb955wrkf1.jpeg,Review #005 - Oxford Oaks Double Barreled Aged Carolina Whiskey,"Every pour has a story, and this one comes out of Oxford, North Carolina.

Age: 3 years (double barrel aged)

Mashbill: Bourbon (at least 51% corn)

Proof: 120

Batch: 9

Price: $55

Nose: Floral banana jumps out first with coffee bean, toasted brown sugar, and a little chocolate drizzle. Some red fruits and blackberries follow with this strange “older than it should be” vibe layered over the young 3 year grain notes. Not in a bad way, just worth pointing out. It even reminds me of those old candy dots my dad used to talk about, with that dusty sugary fruit flavor and a faint touch of oak in the background.

Palate: It immediately screams Woodford Double Oaked. Floral honey and nuts up front, rich mocha and chocolate through the mid-palate, then a spicy cinnamon pop like a Red Hot. The barrel char blends into that spice and works really well. Red fruit and oak show up toward the back and set up the finish.

Finish: Creamy sweet oak with a touch of red fruit. Short, but delicious.

Rating: 7.3 This is a really unique local whiskey, and if you’re ever in North Carolina… Let alone Oxford 😂, it’s worth picking up.

1my1rn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1my1rn9/reveal_if_the_best_food_chopper_ninja_express/,Reveal if the best food chopper Ninja Express truly delivers,"I’ve had the chance to use the Ninja NJ110GR Food Chopper daily for a couple of weeks, and while I’m not the most dedicated chef, this little kitchen gadget has actually made me enjoy food prep more than I ever thought possible. From mincing garlic to grinding nuts for a baking project, this chopper surprised me with its versatility and seemed to genuinely cut down on the time I spent hovering over a cutting board. That said, it’s not all sunshine and roses—there are areas where I think it could be improved.

**Compact and Functional Design**  
The first thing I noticed when unpacking the Ninja NJ110GR was its compact size. It’s designed to fit snugly in most kitchen spaces without taking up too much room on the counter or in a cabinet. Weighing just over a pound, it’s lightweight but still feels sturdy when set up. The 16-ounce bowl hits a sweet spot for me—big enough to handle a good amount of onions or veggies for a meal without being bulky. Its sleek gray finish also looks modern and fits right into any kitchen aesthetic.

**One-Touch Pulse Operation: A Game-Changer for Convenience**  
This feature became my best kitchen buddy almost immediately. Foods typically requiring a lot of manual effort, such as nuts or firm vegetables, can be chopped effectively with just a few taps. There’s no confusing multi-step process, no guessing which button will get the job done—it’s literally one button. I can’t stress enough how satisfying it is to hit that pulse button and watch ingredients get uniformly minced within seconds.

[Check Ninja NJ110GR price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b081vrb8ck/)

**Perfect for Small Batches**  
The bowl capacity is ideal if you’re prepping for one or two people. I frequently used it to chop onions, cilantro, and tomatoes when making salsa for family taco nights. It delivered a consistent texture every time, which is more than I can say for some of my past kitchen tools. But if you were thinking of using this for larger meals or party preparations, you might find yourself chopping in multiple rounds, as 16 ounces can fill up pretty fast when you’re working with bulky ingredients like leafy greens.

**Key Merits**  
- Compact and lightweight, perfect for small kitchens.  
- One-touch pulse operation simplifies use.  
- Consistently chops and minces ingredients quickly.  
- Easy to clean, with removable blades and hand-washable parts.  

**Build and Components**  
Durability is always a key concern for small appliances, and luckily, this chopper scores well in this department. The set comes with a sturdy chopping blade, a container, and a lid, all of which fit securely during use. The blade feels sharp and effective, even when dealing with tougher items like carrots or almonds. The lid locks firmly into place, and the container doesn’t feel flimsy, a problem I’ve encountered with some other choppers in this price range.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Limited bowl capacity for larger batches.  
- Doesn’t grind tougher ingredients like coffee beans with perfect consistency.  
- No dishwasher compatibility means hand washing is mandatory.

**Food Prep Made Hassle-Free**  
Something I appreciated was how simplified the cleanup process is. The parts—blade, lid, and container—are easily removable, so getting gunk out from between components didn’t involve any excessive scrubbing. Although hand washing isn’t everyone’s favorite chore, the small size of the pieces made it less of a hassle for me. 

**Product Alternatives**  
Since I’ve used other small choppers before, I can confidently say this model holds its own against some solid competitors. Compared to models like the Cuisinart Mini Prep or the KitchenAid 3.5-Cup Food Chopper, the Ninja version has fewer bells and whistles but deals with repetitive food prep much more efficiently. Its one-touch pulse system clearly beats fumbling with additional speed modes. However, Cuisinart’s larger capacity (21 ounces) gives it an edge for users who need something for bulkier tasks.

**True Value**  
In terms of cost-effectiveness, this food chopper delivers good bang for your buck. It fits comfortably in that affordable-yet-functional category without feeling cheap. Unlike high-end mini appliances that might offer some additional features I’d rarely use, this product sticks to the essentials and does them well. Based on my experience, it’s particularly well-suited for anyone who cooks small meals frequently and doesn’t want to waste time with a full-size food processor.

I’m new to espresso making and am looking for a machine that would be suitable to bring with me as I move into a sailboat. Husband and I have dialed in our drip coffee process for the boat, but I want to add something for espresso.

Obviously l will need some quite compact. I’d also like something that’s beginner-friendly (I don’t really know what entails, but I figure this group might), and starter price of less that $300 (hoping this is a reasonable?).

For reference, our current coffee equipment is a scale, Baratza Encore grinder, and Bonavita drip machine.

In past lives, I’ve tried Aeropress for something closer to espresso, but it’s just not close enough to differentiate from the drip coffee and I never really dialed in my technique.

Friends who live on their sailboat recommended a Mokapot with a stand alone electric milk frother. Barista friend recommended a Breville Bambino.

What are your recommendations?",1,1755956432.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1my1r3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1my1r3m/the_midnight_matrep_and_other_tales_of_island/,"The Midnight Matrep, and other tales of island security.","
You can’t exactly call something an open secret when it’s paraded outright on propaganda newsfeeds and magazine subscriptions. Not that I know of anyone who actually read those, or even bother with print media anymore, but clearly someone real high up the chain of command knows of the Midnight Matrep. 

Not that he’s trying that hard to stay hidden when he’s had appeared in two well known movies about ah boys training here. I’ve been reassigned from a combat unit to help out the logistics team fuelling the island’s security unit and almost every single evening he shows up at the ferry jerry come crack of amber. Just another face in the trundling crowd of miserable recruits heading to their bunk. 

Always the same results when he flicks us that preppy smile and slides over his camp pass. Nobody on current rotation knew who authorised that particular pass, which looked to be a piece of faded plastic handed out since the early army daze of the island. So it’s probably by some conscript who had left service long ago.

But each time it clears the system and we get explicit permission from the regulars to let him in. One of the boys tried looking him up via the defence database and it shows nothing more than a blank page with a singular line of nonsense wherever it usually shows essential information. 

None of us particularly cared enough to find out being that we’re all just conscripts doing time. And anyone important enough to try didn’t give any orders, just shrugged the anomaly off. Logic given that if he wanted to do something he’d have done so long ago. The Midnight Mat was as a feature of this island since the start of their careers, as prominent as its legendarily shit weather, monkeys and forgotten ruins. 

You’ll see the Mat for the rest of the evening hanging around the canteens beside the medbay. Joyfully mingling with all the lao jiao regulars like they were long time kakis, sharing talks about the state of the world in between sips of coffee while CNA plays from TVs mounted up the background. Everyone who had been here as a serviceman knew the guy. Wasn’t even any sort of phenomenon either, the Midnight Matrep was just the friendly sort who loved talking to folk of all creeds. 

He talked to the cleaners and cookhouse staff who’d came all the way from Malaysia to work like a slave for Singaporean masters. He talked the same no matter the end of the foreign spectrum: be they Bangla workers or Chinese dignitaries. No matter the smell, class or status they were all just good conversation. I could respect that.

Sometimes people would appear out of nowhere and ask for directions to the Mat. Always afternoon but before nightfall in the perfect twilight between times. Hearsay spread on from an ancient game of telephone says that one must never deceive them. Just be honest about his whereabouts. Sometimes, more hearsay probably, people took mental note of a strange lady clad in jewellery looking for him. Other times suited gentlemen speaking in distant tongues we had no name for would show up with wrapped gifts.

No idea what they were doing. Friend of mine saw the Mat getting a blowie under a table once. Another guy piqued up and said they saw the Mat smoking cigars with a suited gentleman dressed out of some “princess’s ball.” A third brought up mention of a few soldiers in strange uniforms frisking the Mat but running away as soon as the amber falls.

Hearsay? Folk cooped up in the island during confinement week would get handsy with the Matrep’s friends, probably try to take expensive stuff that wasn’t theirs.

They’d disappear. Would’ve never believed the stories until- Oh? It’s not because of the air of unease around the Midnight Mat, but because I can’t believe people get this precarious to a guest on our island. 

Until we had to remove a burnt mattress and scrape kilograms of salt off the floors. The supply line’s commander didn’t say anything beyond the ordinary when signing the paperwork that allowed the provost to settle the investigation. Got called in when they were done with the actual work. That was an hour wasted that they no doubt didn’t want to be stuck doing.

Least I managed to salvage some new kit.

Occasionally? Strange men and women who smelled of foreign pines and rusty waters would appear out of thin air all disoriented like newborns. Tourists are a recent phenomenon that only happened after the changeling event a few years ago. 

First batch of specs who found em created a big hoohah when an anti terror task force got called to handle investigations. Whole security team, from the commanding level all the way down to the support personnel got fucked left right centre for letting in common illegals despite the millions of dollars of brand new security measures. Was performing a pushup over a mud pool in filthy admin clothes and facing the rest of my scuttled career in a political prison when a man in white polo stepped in to speak with security command. 

As if like nothing major? Everyone was sent back to their bunks and told to get ready for inspection. Inspection passed quickly, too quickly and we all got an early bookout on Thursday night. The men in white took over the week’s security detail so we knew we did nothing wrong. An anomalous issue, they clarified, not human error.

Had a good laugh over smuggled beers when we returned back from our extended holiday. The new rules were surprisingly easy to follow; just haul ‘em to the guardroom and let staffers from the Singaporean embassy handle things with nice tour packages to our great country’s sights. 

Had a tourist spawn this morning. Buncha cookhouse workers dialled my team in because a tourist had appeared inside the boiler rooms they called a kitchen. These were disgusting places, hot and fetid and covered to the brim with clattering industrial equipment that magically churned frozen food to barely edible chow for a tirade of forever hungry recruits. I was already sweating when me and my team entered the place.

Usually settled logistics but I had to do a full 24 hrs duty because the guy who was supposed to clock in today got called back to the mainland to handle things with police. Nothing secret squirrel, government just suspended him for drunk driving naked down the Causeway last Saturday night. Lmao even. Didn’t like putting on that all black kit reserved solely for anomalous events. Hated it even more when we stepped into the kitchen.

Heard a tourism screaming bloody murder in a tongue so ancient, so profane that I had to wince when following the noice through the kitchen. An easy search that lead me to her in about a minute. Memories get foggy over here, so thats why I’m writing this.

In front of me was this bespectacled ginger who had thrown off all her clothes til she was completely buck raving naked. Chest pressed against a gigantic cooker like it was a lifeline in a sight that would’ve been…titillating if not for the absolutely dismal state of frostbite she was in. 

So frosted over that the red had turned into the black of necrosis. Skin paled like a corpse’ pallor. Eyes red and bloodshot. Teeth had chattered so hard that the gums were starting to rend and bleed in ways I didn’t know possible. Looked like a ghoul in a really bad wig.

Hard to explain in a r/nosleep post. Especially since I was better at economics than at engineering, let alone biology. But all those factoid channels on my Youtube feed taught me that sometimes when people are faced with extreme cold their minds perform a complete 180. Something about feeling a nostalgic warmth via blood flushing into their brains makes them remove their clothes even in the middle of a snowstorm. 

Strange quirk of biology. But I like to think that it’s simply the brain’s way of mercy killing its host. Like that little voice in your head that says “Hey buddy, it’s cool now. You can let go.”

Keyword: Snowstorm. We were in the midst of one of Singapore’s hottest regions and this strange woman had just popped out of nowhere. Suffering from literal end stage frostbite and trapped in a boiler room that until the morning, had been locked. Just what the hell was going on? I was with the security team yes, but I mainly handled the back end of things. Never fieldwork.

But rules were still rules. My job as a commander was to handle business professionally and serviceably. Accountability Serviceability and Proficiently and all that jazz they indoctrinated us via brainal beams back in command school. So I told my guest to behave as if there was a lady in the room and call the medics over. 

“Ma’am. Do you understand me? I need you to stay still and be cooperative. You are in a restricted military facility and have to be processed. Resistance will be met by charges under a military tribunal.”

No response. Just more screaming in a language that sounded almost like english with the vowels all screwed up.

Along the way I noticed an orange parka that was streaked red with blood. Heavy hiking boots more rugged than mine and pants that looked to be insulated with multiple layers of leaking aerogels. You walk in the island with those and you’d drop dead in a minute. But they were slick with melting ice. Quaint huh? 

Medics had to drag the terrified woman out of the kitchen raving and screaming. She managed to swing a fist hard enough that it broke one of their anomalous kit’s masks. 

Moved to step in then. Been a while since I had to sprint out from the back of an armoured vehicle back in the 17th Dragoons, and all that bug-like kit I was wearing made me feel like a damned imperial stormtrooper in all the worst ways. Used to find the stuff cool. But now all I can associate with tacticool gear is just sweaty fatigue. Sprinted fast and ignored the squelched of something squeaky being crushed underfoot to restrain the raving tourist. The medics beside me cursing as brushed him aside to apply flexi-cuffs.

The tourism didn’t fight that hard against my gloves. I think all the resistance was gone when she made eye contact with the medic, then mine. Something ain’t right with her pupils.

Human. I recognise the word coming out of her strange tirade, but just barely. Stayed silent the whole way as we moved her into the medbay. 

We followed the rules. Followed protocol. Cleaned up right and told witnesses to keep their story consistent if someone asks. Nobody was hurt and after we cleaned up all the excess stuff we tossed em into a crate and headed back out.

Just another day. 

But gosh damned, I was hungry and it was getting late. The staffers were already finished with prepping dinner by the time my team was debriefed by the medics and security command. So I stripped off my kit, changed to admin gear and headed out to the sports field to meet the Midnight Mat. Got a few members with me for a snack party. 

There’s a sports field on the island flanked by a great stadium. An oval track used to conduct IPPT tests, sports games or self directed training in the day. There’s a scenic view hidden behind a layer of concertina bordered wire fences of our great Singaporean shoreline and clean waters. If they are the arteries that our great nation rely on, then the sprawling fleets of cargo ships are the vital cells. There are waterbreaks to prevent the track from being flooded, sprouting from them like flagpoles studded with rectangles are Security Masts meant to prevent any anomalous incursions. We control them from the security room.

Several fliers are taped via folded masking tape onto concrete walls. Same few rules written on them as the older fliers tacked onto pinboards already chock full of ancient notices that warn of head exhaustion. Lots of things in this island could kill you that didn’t involve ghosty nasties like heat exhaustion, dengue, tetanus, heat stroke, hailstorms, influenzas, leeches and brain eating amoeba from stillwater. Last week we had to get a helicopter over to Changi because an excused dust personnel keeled over from inhaling asbestos that leaked out of a storeroom. The week before we had to call the same helicopter for a couple of specialist trainees who keeled after a long night march via sheer heat alone. Don’t know the genius who made his guys march twenty over klicks in full body armour in the midst of a heatwave, but I hope he got charged.   

Island has a long history of tales like that. Since my father’s time there was this story of a recruit who was found disembowelled, his innards arranged neat and tidy on a ground sheet like it was final inspection. Commanders speak of ghostly apparitions approaching them upon the devil’s hour asking if their duties could be relieved. Those on a road march know when to hurry up their pace when they get a whiff of frangipani. Another common story was the sighting of ghost platoons still marching in formation; clad neat and spiffy in Edwardian era uniforms. 

Holy shit do those look sexy. Pulled straight out of Dishonoured.  

I’ve seen something like that before. The garish sighting of flags from my tradition marching through tracks that lead to forgotten town while on a ration run. Had to follow protocol, me and my driver immediately diverting our eyes and flooring it. My hands praying to GuanYin the whole time as we ignored the procession. Driving away until the sound of leatherbound drums faded to the background. We had jobs of our own and I do not want another commander breathing down my neck. Let alone a warrior sent by Duyi to retrieve the unrepentant.

Driver had stories of his own. A big man from the Philippines who’d swore up and down that he’d saw a familiar Manananggal soaring through the night. The air of this ancient island had its own way doing that to people. Could be the conspiracy nonsense. Could be bad fengshui. I didn’t ask.

But the field behind by the tracks was a known safezone. No Security Mast required. The guy I was substituting told me a story of a time where he was being chased by glowing lights that gave him glimpses into “higher dimensions”. Thought he was high on kpods by he swore up and down that it was “legit type shit. Not like acid liddat.” But it stopped as soon as he met the Midnight Mat and his ninja van at 0131 hrs. You could always see the timing from this towering light post flanked by floodlights that highlighted a gigantic OLED screen that showed tons of information. None less embolden than a 24hr clock.

The rules, flanked by many many pictures of influencers that had crossed the ferry terminal tk taste the Mat’s food are as follows:

1- Bring your own cutlery and box. The Midnight Mat is not responsible for providing basic utensils for the customer. 

2- Bring your own bag for your own litter. The Midnight Mat is not responsible for hygiene beyond his own radius. Any acts of littering will be flagged out to military RnD for review. 

3- Do not insult, harass or assault the Midnight Mat. No staring incident. No theft. Any acts of aggression to a civilian vendor will be responded to as such by island security. Vendor is entitled to self defence limited by legal law. 

There was something written here that wasn’t there when we went around to paste the fliers. It was “LIMITED BUT NOT ENFORCED.” Ominous- but so far they were reasonable. Not something to worry about beyond conversing with the randoms at the pasar malam. 

4- One order per person. Keep your order for yourself only. You are not to order on the behest of another. You are not a pack mule. Island CO empowers anyone to refuse unlawful order to buy on behalf of another. 

5- The field must be kept neatly trimmed. Grass must NOT exceed ten inches of height. If grass is overgrown you must alert island command for mowing. 

6- No animals must be in the field. Field must be tended by pest control specialist in order to prevent anything more intelligent than a siphonophore making a presence.

A weird one but I can understand why a vendor wouldn’t want cats and dogs prowling onto their business. The hell is a siphonophore though? Sounds like some sea shit. How’d you even gauge intelligence in a jellyfish? 

7- If field needs to be vacated for utmost emergency alert island security command. The guardroom will activate emergency siren and the field will be vacated by vendor. If not an emergency? Just ask politely and give reasoning.

8- ALL CUSTOMERS MUST VACATE THE FIELD FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE 0300 HRS. ENSURE VISIBILITY OF DIGITAL CLOCK AT ALL TIMES. THE MIDNIGHT MATREP WILL GIVE YOU A LAST WARNING AT THE FIVE MINUTE MARK. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH GUIDELINE WILL RESULT IN COURT MARTIAL OFFENCE. 

9- ALL CUSTOMERS MUST RETURN TO THE FIELD AT LEAST FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER 0415 HRS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH GUIDELINE WILL RESULT IN COURT MARTIAL OFFENCE. 

There it was again. The same phrasing and implicit threat that we’ll punish anyone for flouting regs with the same aplomb as the idiots who do shit like mess about safety rules. Lots of TikTok trends about sabotaging equipment for revenge against toxic coworker these days y’know? Honestly a little strange that they even had a rule for what I assumed was to be a simple smoke break, pondered me. But we had been explicitly told by every single guard commander to leave the field by 0245hrs as to not break official guidelines. 

“Eh u/Nuerax. Stare so hard for fuck? I thought we read it already?” One of my guys asked before pointing towards a trickling queue of military personnel already getting their fried delicacies. I could recognise by their uniform and equipment that they were from the people stuck with 24hr duties, or stay in personnel here for a quick snack. The tell tale smell of material meals filling my nostrils as I nodded and joined up with my guys.

—-

It was 1101hrs according to the clock when we reached the Midnight Matrep’s peripheral. Somehow an entire ninja van had materialised out of thin air, as they were known to do so - not very strange - and driven all the way across the hyper militarised island under watch by sensory thijimagicks without being noticed. Didn’t even leave marks on the lawn beyond where it had parked as if it had just appeared out of thin air.

Just like the tables and chairs that appeared from thin air. Humbly done so to accommodate each and every single one of us. Nobody asked questions and frankly I couldn’t have cared less about the phenomenon. 

The Matrep looked like anyone you’d encounter drinking in Bali Lane or working the pasar malam. A tall, lean malay man who wore a black t-shirt emblazoned with a faded print of whatever is vogue at the time. He wore loose, baggy pants with a checkerboard pattern that covered his Sketchers workshoes and a silver chain around his neck. A black ballcap rested on his head and below that was one of those plastic faceguards worn during the Covid period to prevent saliva from spilling onto the meals. Tattoos adorned his forearms, strange inscriptions that looked like Arabic yet felt older somehow. Arches curved in ways I could’ve never explained.  

Stranger yet was his honeyed gold pupils that contrasted all our dark pupils. Eyes that glinted so bright under the harsh floodlights that it felt as if they could see through our souls. That the golden tips of his hair weren’t frosted, but rather a strangely natural blonde. 

Looks like a male version of Rell. Y’know, from hit animation studio League of Legends? 

“Ah bang.” He called to me and motioned towards a laminated card full of delicacies quite standard around the army camps of Singapore. Y’know the usual: Cutlets, waffles, cutlet waffles, maggi noodles accessorised with cutlets. Pork chops and chicken chops and lamb chops. Fries with rice and everything else. Even had the same banger curry puffs only sold on range days and the mini hotdogs skewered on sticks from Old Chang Kee. 
Everything around the ninja van looked to be plucked from a normal canteen kitchen. For example you could see the air fryers, coolers, oiled woks on a field stove and what not. I couldn’t see a single price tag on the menu. Coming from Singapore where everything, and I mean literally everything has a price unless the state intervenes such an anomaly felt wrong. I couldn’t actually forgive most of the odd coming ons of the island as part of some messed up government project involving beaming thoughtwaves into our brains.

But priceless meals were a step too far into emphatic unknown. Part glitch in the matrix part rift in our country’s nature. 

“What do you want for tonight, boss?” *The Matrep asked again, voice changing over from burlesque apathy to patient concern as those honeyed eyes met mine. I felt the weight of timelessness past over me like the gaze of a man with all the time in the world. Yet I hurriedly came to a conclusion because the guy behind me tsked his displeasure out loud.

“Maggi cutlet with egg ah. But how I pay? You got PayLah?”

“No need. I damn efficient one.” The Matrep laughs before pouring some warm water over a sprinkled packet of maggi noodles on the wok. A top of the line airfryer clacking shut with a breaded cutlet thrown inside for defrosting. He was now beginning to stir fry it with occasional glances to the defrosting. 

“All I need is something intangible from you. Hmm.”

The Matrep shook the wok and sent seasoned noodles up an inch in the air before starting to twirl it about with all the care in the world. When people meant that he cooked food, he really really cooked food like performing the most important art in the world. Love and care went into every shake of that blessed wok, a creeping smile appearing on his face as he tossed it again and again like something satisfying was coming together. 

“You remember the rat you stepped on in the cookhouse? I want it.”

“Huh? Paiseh ah. But you say what fuck? You want cook me the rat?” I spat at him, eyes doing a double take as I wondered if it’s time to sic my authority on him. No commander likes being insulted in front of their men, let alone in friendly territory. 

“No need. I efficient one!” He says again while sprinkling another packet of seasoning into the wok. “That sensation of stepping on the rat will do.” 

I paused, then closed my eyes while coming to terms that the drying gristle of a dead living being was still stuck on my Altamas. Had tried my best to forget about it but like a bad shame it clung to the sole’s underside with tenacity.

It felt so wrong, so alien to give up something that had already happened like that. My arms were tingling with goosebumps now…

But on the other hand? The maggi noodles were starting to smell like a personal heaven. ",1,1755956426.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I listen to much, much less folk music compared to another era but I must admit that I was curious to listen to this production as the reviews about it were so rave. And OMG they were right. Rarely has a work moved me so much, the lo-fi quality recording, in the style of early albums by Cat Power and Elliott Smith, bringing a lot to the complete sorrow that runs through this album. So suddenly, it means that I can't always listen to it, given the mood in which this thing places the listener. In addition, the interludes and use of samples such as recorded laughter add a lot to the atmosphere and make this live performance a rather unique experience, which could shake up the way musical artists approach the live experience. Also, this is the first time in a very long time that I've bought a cassette album, mainly because the vinyl version wasn't available. I was a little less enthusiastic about it when I bought it, but upon receiving it, this little object remains very satisfying to store and handle.

The ppl she films look extremely uncomfortable, i can relate bc she used to film my partner and i while we went out clubbing like she was filming zoo animals.

She views queer ppl as party clowns, claims to be bi when called out for her blatant transphobia and terf ideology and theres nothing i can do about it and it really bothers me. She posts about things i showed her as if it were her own hobby/interest and it just comes off so inauthentic bc it is. 

Feels like she only hangs w queer ppl for inspo and then drops them when shes done sucking their personality dry. She takes queer aesthetics and then waters them down to appeal to evangelical church buddies. She even mimics my mannerisms and the way i used to speak/act pre transition, particularly my vocal fry and heavy brooklyn NY accent, its so disturbing having this person live as a walking relic of my repressed self. 

Oh and her name is also my deadname and i was told by a mutual friend that she goes around pretending she has no clue im trans uses my deadname and misgenders me referring to me as “other [deadname]”

Ik i just need to forget about the whole thing and move on and tbh i have for the most part, but im feeling very angry rn and just need somewhere to share this story. She presented herself as queer friendly at first and then starts proselytizing so it was overall a traumatic experience and i keep being retraumatized bc she makes new accounts based off my hobbies and interests constantly and they come up in my recommended despite having her blocked.

Would this interest you?[text],"My first ever post here 

For the past 12 years, I’ve bootstrapped a food company from the ground up with a small team (5-10) + no outside investment (50K) 

Over that time we’ve:

Reached thousands of restaurants and retail stores from direct walk ins to trade shows and online sales outreach.  

Built a brand from scratch (in industry dominated by a giant)

Walked trade shows, pitched distributors, and closed deals

Partnered with producers, manufacturers, and packaging suppliers

Learned how to create a brand and not just product. 

Established priceless relationship with manufacturers, distributors and buyers 

Now I’d like to take what I’ve learned and help others do the same. 

Here’s what I’m working on:

	•	Helping new entrepreneurs develop and launch real products (starting with coffee, mushroom coffee, and health & wellness)
	•	Connecting them directly with distributors, manufacturers, and suppliers

	•	Sharing the practical side of trade shows, sales meetings, and brand building that no one really teaches

	•	And not just that—I’d also like to support and potentially invest in the right brands with our existing resources and relationships

My questions for this community:

	•	If you were starting a food/beverage brand today, what’s the #1 thing you’d want help with?

	•	Would mentorship + potential resource investment from someone who’s been in the trenches be valuable to you

	•	For those already in the space: what do you wish you had when you were starting out?

I'm 40 5'2 and now 74kg.
2 years ago I was 60.5kg - I left my job in health care as I'd had enough of feeling awful about my job, and am now over a year in a sit down job.
Amongst all that i moved house and city, and think I had a small breakdown - I'm trying to get back on track, whilst believing I'm at the start of peri stuff, but also being maybe referred to rheumatology due to daily pain in my feet/joints/achilles.

I try to walk at least 2miles a day, and know I need to get this up. I try to go the gym and lift, but find I get incredibly sore - I'd love to know what people follow? I think i maybe do too much, then get sore, then have to stop. I also think I need to up steps to 10k, as this seems to be the norm from everything I'm reading here (I average 6k a day).
I've always enjoyed being active, I played badminton and went swimming this morning, but i find working 5 days to often be exhausting enough and am desperate to build a good routine.

I'm mostly vegan and averaging 1500kcal a day. I try to eat the same daily - a normal day will be:
- Breakfast: 1scoop huel, banana, coffee
- Lunch 1 Pitta with low fat hummus, leaves, cucumber tomatoes and seeds. I have a big chunknof cucumber on the side, and depending how much exercise I've done that morning another pitta to dip in said hummus. 1x apple
- Dinner we mostly batch cook lentil/bean currys/stews, tofu salad ...basically try to mix it up, but use very little processed food.

At most I have 40g of protein a day, and do not know how to get this up without upping calories - which I don't want to do. I'm looking into low cal protein powders to take and wondered if others did this?
I'm worried that the low protein is holding me back from losing weight, but my partner (male) is adament that if i up my protein and don't burn it off, it will cause further weight gain.
I've limited my alcohol right down to 2 vodka seltzers a week - thats my treat.

I take omega 3/Vit B/multi vit and a probiotic each day, and have recently started taking biotin as my hair seems to have stopped growing/is breaking more - wondering if added protein will help this also.

I just feel really stuck tbh. Friends are suffering peri symptoms, but none are struggling with weight like I am, and with always having been maybe a 12, now being a 14/16 is depressing the hell out of me - i have no clothes that fit and just feel genuinely disgusted by myself. If i felt happy I thinknid just stay as i am, but i fewl sluggish, get pain and know this weight is not healthy for my size.

I'd love to know any suggestions and welcome any comments on my routine etc 🙋🏻‍♀️",0,1755956310.0,Perimenopause,2,0.5,False

1my1mfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1my1mfs/explore_best_coffee_maker_features_in_the_ninja/,Explore Best Coffee Maker Features in the Ninja DualBrew Pro Review,"The Ninja CFP301 DualBrew Pro Specialty Coffee Maker landed on my countertop a couple of weeks ago, and I’ve been putting it through its paces ever since. With its sleek black plastic exterior and an impressive set of features, this coffee maker has caused quite a buzz in my kitchen. As a daily coffee drinker who alternates between quick K-cup mornings and lazy weekend carafe brews, I couldn’t wait to see what this machine could do. Spoiler alert: it’s not perfect, but it gets a lot right.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker feels solid and well-made, with a modern appearance that fits seamlessly into most kitchens. Its dimensions (15.5 x 11.4 x 9.1 inches) make it compact enough to squeeze into tight spaces while still offering plenty of functionality. I particularly appreciate the thoughtful inclusion of the glass carafe, which gives a nice aesthetic touch. The weight, at just under ten pounds, strikes a good balance between stability and portability. The plastic build, while sturdy, occasionally feels a bit less premium than one might hope for in this price range, but that's more of a nitpick than a dealbreaker.

**Ease of Operation**  
One thing I loved right out of the gate was how straightforward and user-friendly the machine is. It’s fully automatic, so even my pre-caffeinated brain can handle its controls. I found the pod system to be incredibly convenient when I was in a hurry, but the option to brew grounds gave me the versatility to refine my coffee on a lazy Sunday. The buttons and settings are intuitive, and the brewing sizes available (including everything from a small cup to a full carafe) cater to just about any situation. 

[Check Ninja CFP301 price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b0btp84qm5/)

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
One standout feature of this coffee maker is its speed. If you're used to the sluggish performance of some other machines, this one will surprise you. The claim of brewing a K-Cup faster than a leading Keurig coffee maker proves accurate in my tests. The four brewing styles—Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty—are a highlight. I’m particularly addicted to the Specialty setting, which creates a rich coffee concentrate perfect for lattes and macchiatos. I used it to craft a cappuccino that rivaled what I’d find in a café. 

The built-in milk frother, though basic, elevates the machine further. My daughter enjoyed making her own frothy hot chocolate using it. However, the frother’s design means it’s not as powerful as standalone frothers, so the texture might not satisfy serious cappuccino aficionados.

**Good Points**  
- Offers both pod and ground coffee options for versatility  
- Compact design fits neatly into most kitchens  
- Specialty Brew feature creates coffeehouse-style beverages  
- Independent hot water system for tea, soup, and more  

**Drawbacks**  
- Plastic materials feel slightly less premium  
- Frother performance falls short for serious latte lovers  

**Competing Products**  
The most obvious rival to this machine is the Keurig K-Duo, another dual-use coffee maker designed for pods and grounds alike. While the Ninja CFP301 outpaces the Keurig on brewing speed and versatility (thanks to its four brew styles and a frother), the K-Duo edges ahead with its reusable filter included in the box. Another option, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, offers similar functionality at a lower price point but sacrifices some of the features the Ninja shines with, like its Specialty Brew mode.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
In terms of value, the Ninja CFP301 delivers a balanced package. You’re paying a bit more compared to simpler machines, but the added flexibility and features make that extra investment worthwhile. I find the option to make anything from a quick pod of coffee to a full cappuccino at home to be great for the wallet in the grand scheme, cutting down on trips to pricey coffee shops. That said, if you’re strictly a black coffee purist, there are more budget-friendly options that might meet your needs.

“We must stop this terrible practice of taking our most precious natural resource and, for no good reason, infusing it with tea leaves, rosehips, rooibos, and God knows what else,” conservationist Regina Alexander said in response to the report, observing that once water had been contaminated by the tea-brewing process, it could no longer be used for bathing, cleaning, preparing food, making coffee, or any other beneficial purpose. “It will be impossible to sustain the world’s growing population if our limited freshwater supply is squandered in such a reckless manner. We pour water over tea bags, let it steep for three to five minutes, and for what? The opportunity to take delicate sips and say we can detect subtle notes of peppermint? It makes no sense.”

LSD = weird but still had some structure.
Caffeine = complete chaos, the webs were the most broken and messy.

Turns out it kinda makes sense. For spiders, their web is their project it needs patience, rhythm, and focus. Caffeine messed all of that up. For us, small amounts of coffee make us sharp, but if we overdo it we get jittery, anxious, scattered… and our own “webs” (our work, our plans) start falling apart.

We clicked pretty quickly and got close fast. We talked openly about life, goals, and struggles, and over time, I met a lot of his friends and family. It genuinely felt like a deep friendship was forming.

That said, I started noticing some things. Charles could be really rigid in conversations (like he always had to be right). Even chill discussions would turn into debates. Still, I stuck around. I gave him relationship advice, shared job tips, and tried to support him whenever he needed it. I thought that support went both ways, but looking back, I’m not so sure.

Earlier this year, we were talking about politics and he told me he was conservative. He asked about my views and I said I leaned liberal. Right away, he said, “That’s probably just because of your dad.” I said yeah, my upbringing had some influence, but I’ve formed my own opinions. He laughed and said, “How much?” I told him I didn’t want to get into it and wasn’t going to quantify it. He kept going anyway, trying to convince me I actually agreed with him deep down. It didn’t feel like a respectful convo—it felt like he was trying to invalidate everything I said.

The next day, I texted him and said I felt disrespected by how he handled the conversation. I wasn’t aggressive (I just wanted to say how I felt and ask for an apology). He told me he doesn’t like texting and wanted to talk in person.

So we met up at Starbucks. I bought him a coffee, thinking we’d clear the air. Instead, it all blew up. The moment we sat down, he went off on me (said I was trying to tear him down, that I have low self-esteem, that I’m controlling, untrustworthy, and that I “love conflict""). It felt like he had been building up resentment and was now unloading all of it. I reminded him of how much I’d supported him (not to throw it in his face, but to show that I always had good intentions).

He ended the conversation by saying, “This friendship is over.” Then he told me to get up and hug him. I said no, but offered a handshake instead. He shook my hand and walked away.

Afterward, I sent him one final message and blocked him. It basically said I didn’t agree with the things he said about me, and that I wasn’t okay with being insulted like that. I told him I didn’t want to be friends anymore and that I deserved better. I haven’t spoken to him since.

It’s been about 7 months now. I also stopped going to the church he invited me to. I keep getting texts from his flying monkeys every 2 or so months.

1my1huj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LMU/comments/1my1huj/tips_for_the_new_students/,Tips For The New Students!,"Welcome to LMU! Hopefully these tips can help those who are coming to LMU for the first time!

**Campus**

* [**This campus drawing**](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2Ftips-for-the-new-students-v0-zzuH6ASRV53dW8TQ8rVfm1fbSWXfKeiudlSipHBT1nA.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D2c568dee41ffcff1a9b33e4fa5e8d06a8bd3242d) gives the feel of the building locations much better than the typical blueprint maps. This might also help you map out your class locations.
* Regarding the Campus drawing:
   * Huesman & Sullivan dorms are now replaced with the new **Palm North & South** dorms.
* Watch campus tour videos if you can't visit before the school starts.

**Meeting new people**

* **Be as openly friendly in the dorm during the first few weeks and just strike conversations.** The other Freshmen are also looking to make new friends so it's easy to start chatting. Do not be shy about it. Just say hello to anyone you see and start a conversation. Talk about your interest, hobby, major, etc. *Cliques can form very quickly*.
* Food places are clumped around the Freshman dorms so it's easy to go eat with your dorm/room mates or find your friends in these areas.
* Some ppl in the dorms might hold a small party in their room on Friday/weekends and you can meet new ppl there as well.
* Certain classes can be quiet and interactions with the other students might not occur much especially if it's entirely lecture based and there are other classes to attend right after. However, for classes that end around the lunch time, I have seen classmates forming a group to eat together afterward and become friendly overall.
* You can try to make a class group chat to study & work on homework together and it helped them making big study group friends. Having even just one or two class friends can help you out a lot.
* Start going to the gym in general. If you have dorm-mates or roommates who also like to exercise or work out, it can become a small group activity. If you fail to make friends who goes to the gym, at least you get to be healthier.
* **Sports clubs** and other types of clubs are decent ways to meet people who share your interest. If there's any sport or activity you like, I highly recommend checking out the clubs for those.
* **Frat/Sorority** is a great way to meet many new people. 90% of my friends all rushed for Frat/Sorority early on. Many of them formed their own cliques within the Frat to start living together off-campus by their Junior & Senior years.
* You are going to form a group of 2 or 4 with your close friends by the end of your Freshman year to room together for the Sophomore year. Most of my friends formed groups of 4 for their Sophomore rooming.

**Food**

* Buy a water bottle to carry around and DRINK WATER especially if you have a long schedule.
* While the foods are not bad, it's ***very*** **easy** to get tired of especially if you get a class in a certain food area which can make you eat there very often since it's right there. Try out different places on campus and try to eat healthy as possible. (This usually improves when you move into Apt with kitchen & refrigerator in Junior/Senior year. However, this only applies if you are willing to cook and buy groceries)
* (The repetitiveness of the food aspect above is based on **when LMU used Sodexo Catering, which has been changed to Aramark Collegiate Hospitality starting from Fall 2025.** I am not sure if the repetitiveness or the food quality part mentioned above still applies.**)**
* Rent a small **refrigerator & microwave**. During busy time periods (multiple tests, quizzes, etc), having some quick simple meals can save up a lot of time by not needing to walk to a food place & wait in line and then walking back to your room after finishing the food.
   * Keep some **fruits, milk,** **jam, peanut butter** etc. in the refrigerator.
   * You can get basic groceries and some simple meals from the LMU's convenience stores.
   * You can store up groceries from the ***Ralphs*** which is about 15\~20 min of walking from the campus.
   * **Cereal & Milk or Bread & Jam** are perfect quick breakfast options to have in your room if you don't want to get up early in the morning to have breakfast in one of the food places.
   * There are few **coffee stands** on campus. You can grab a coffee & pastry for your breakfast.
* **Water boiler** for quick instant coffee, tea, and cup noodles. However, a boiler is not needed at all if you only get coffee & tea from the coffee stands or food places.
* **Know the off-campus food options**. During the vacations/breaks, most of the food places on the campus will close. Those that are open during this time period often do not serve breakfast or closes early. If you are staying on the campus during those times (*pay* *attention international student staying on campus*), it is essential to know where to eat. I ate very often at **Benny's Tacos** near LMU while I bought bread & peanut butters for breakfast during the breaks.
   * Another good reason to have a refrigerator & microwave for some simple meals
* **Domino Pizza Delivery**. I shared an account with my roommates to store points together for a free pizza from time to time. It was very helpful during the test weeks. (I am not sure if this is still a thing)

**Academy**

* Academy is your **PRIORITY**. Freshman year can feel crazy. There are so much freedom and excitement with everything especially during the first semester. *Don't forget that your assignments & grades come first*. I've seen many people getting bad grades early on due to falling behind the schedule.
   * Mark your calendar once you receive the syllabuses from your classes so you have a general idea when you will get really busy.
* Connect with your professors. **Use their office hours**. They can guide you through your projects, essays, and make sure you manage/understand them. During Junior/Senior years, I had many occasions when I used their office hours to receive some guidance for my essays and it's something I wish I did earlier on. You can end up having the same professors again in your future main subject classes, which can help you out if you need some favor.
* Studying in your room is fine if you are good at concentrating and your roommate doesn't distract you. The dorm lounges can be hit or miss depending on if your dorm-mates use them for studying or a hangout area. I was least distracted when I was **studying in the library** while having extra space with the large desks. The library usually has enough empty desks and tables so it's really easy to study there. You can also rent a group study room to use with your friends. However, the library gets absolutely filled during the exam weeks.
* There are also people who like to study in the University Hall and in their major department areas.
* **Textbooks**: Many people have said that there were several textbooks that they wish they didn't buy due to how those books were never really needed for the class. Personally, I only had that experience with one class (that class relied heavily on lecture & discussion without using the book) so it likely depends on your class & major.
   * I used **Kindle** to rent/buy books which often ended up being cheaper than buying the books from the store. It's very convenient overall since you can carry the device around easily.
   * Otherwise, I rented most of my books from the store. If you do this (unless the procedure has changed since I graduated), keep the receipt somewhere safe to return those books later.

**Off-Campus**

* Familiarize yourself with what's outside of LMU such as **malls** and **food places**. Take your friends to eat outside and hang out in the city during the weekend. I didn't do this much and I wish I explored L.A a bit more.
* Bigger parties happen outside of the campus, often hosted by Frat/Soro/Sport Clubs etc.

**Consider buying/bringing:**

* **A Shower Basket**.
   * Freshman dorms have shared bathrooms on each floor. Use a shower basket to carry/store your shower products. During my Freshman year, I saw a guy carrying shampoo & scrubs in a plastic bag to the shower for the first couple of days until he got a shower basket.
   * Shoes/Flip flops for shower.
* **Laundry Basket & Detergents**.
   * *Mandatory*. Depending on the dorms, the laundry room might be outside of the dorm building and you will have to carry those clothes all the way there. Even if your dorm has a laundry room on your floor, you are still going to need a basket to carry all those clothes around.
* **Umbrella/Windbreaker & ""Winter Clothes""**.
   * It doesn't rain often in L.A. However, there are rainy period and it often catches people completely off guard if they are not from L.A. I brought a windbreaker and bought an umbrella from the bookstore which was enough.
   * It doesn't get that cold in L.A. I had three jackets and a couple of beanies which were enough for me.
   * A thin blanket to carry around comes in handy especially if you get cold in the library. You can also use it as an extra blanket to sleep with during Winter period.
* **Printer**
   * This one depends on your preference. I've had roommates who never needed it and printed their works from the library while my self & my other roommate were printing all the time in our room. However, this was due to how we did our essays and reports in our rooms and printed there.
* A bike/skateboard/long-board.
   * I personally never really needed one but I knew many people who used bikes or skateboards to get to their classes. Just keep in mind that you can't ride it everywhere on campus.
* A small fan.
   * It can get hot during the summer. I only used a fan during Freshman year but my friends used their fans every year.
* Plastic organizers/drawers.
   * Comes in handy if you have extra clothes. I used it to store the towels.
* Extra mattress padding
   * Everyone loves extra comfort. One of my roommates added two extra padding for his bed.
* Hand held Vacuum cleaner
   * Something that's not necessary but I found having one very helpful especially when the floor gets dusty or you spilled something etc. Best way to avoid collecting big dust & hair clumps under your desk.

One random personal tip:

* Take lots of photo, whether it's to make a photo album on Google Drive or post on your Instagram/FB album. One of my personal regret was not taking many pictures and ended up having very few pictures overall by the time I graduated. Meanwhile my friend used Google Drives to create an album for each year.

I also wanted to talk about the Freshman dorms and the other food options near the dorm areas but hard to tell what have changed since I graduated in 2018.

1my1gl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1my1gl7/narcissistic_acquaintance_blindsided_me_then_i/,"Narcissistic acquaintance blindsided me, then I blocked him and people see me as emotional","I (26M) became friends with a guy (let’s call him Charles) after meeting him at the library last year. We clicked pretty quickly and got close fast. We talked openly about life, goals, and struggles, and over time, I met a lot of his friends and family. It genuinely felt like a deep friendship was forming.

That said, I started noticing some things. Charles could be really rigid in conversations (like he always had to be right). Even chill discussions would turn into debates. Still, I stuck around. I gave him relationship advice, shared job tips, and tried to support him whenever he needed it. I thought that support went both ways, but looking back, I’m not so sure.

Earlier this year, we were talking about politics and he told me he was conservative. He asked about my views and I said I leaned liberal. Right away, he said, “That’s probably just because of your dad.” I said yeah, my upbringing had some influence, but I’ve formed my own opinions. He laughed and said, “How much?” I told him I didn’t want to get into it and wasn’t going to quantify it. He kept going anyway, trying to convince me I actually agreed with him deep down. It didn’t feel like a respectful convo—it felt like he was trying to invalidate everything I said.

The next day, I texted him and said I felt disrespected by how he handled the conversation. I wasn’t aggressive (I just wanted to say how I felt and ask for an apology). He told me he doesn’t like texting and wanted to talk in person.

So we met up at Starbucks. I bought him a coffee, thinking we’d clear the air. Instead, it all blew up. The moment we sat down, he went off on me (said I was trying to tear him down, that I have low self-esteem, that I’m controlling, untrustworthy, and that I “love conflict""). It felt like he had been building up resentment and was now unloading all of it. I reminded him of how much I’d supported him (not to throw it in his face, but to show that I always had good intentions).

He ended the conversation by saying, “This friendship is over.” Then he told me to get up and hug him. I said no, but offered a handshake instead. He shook my hand and walked away.

Afterward, I sent him one final message and blocked him. It basically said I didn’t agree with the things he said about me, and that I wasn’t okay with being insulted like that. I told him I didn’t want to be friends anymore and that I deserved better. I haven’t spoken to him since.

It’s been about 7 months now. I also stopped going to the church he invited me to. I keep getting texts from his flying monkeys every 2 or so months. My responses remain kind and when he tells me to come hang or eat I say I'll let him know and I ghost him. please advice",1,1755955675.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False
1my1g43,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyLive/comments/1my1g43/discover_the_tide_pen_pro_stain_remover_review/,Discover the Tide Pen Pro Stain Remover review: Does it really work?,"The MADE BY NEHEMIAH Tide Pen Pro Stain Remover is one of those products I didn’t realize I absolutely needed until I used it. The idea of portable stain removal seemed a bit like overkill to me initially; I mean, isn’t soap and water good enough? Nope. After a particularly unfortunate coffee spill during a meeting, this little pen truly saved my day. Carrying it feels more like insurance for those clumsy moments with food or drinks that we all have but don’t like to admit.

**Portability at Its Best**  
This stain remover is all about convenience. The pen-like design is compact and lightweight, which makes it easy to toss into a bag without giving it a second thought. It fits right next to my lip balm in my purse, and it’s been an unsung hero in my car's glove compartment more than once. You don’t need extra napkins, tissues, or an awkward water-dabbing dance when a spill happens. Just whip it out, apply, and move on with your day.

Check [MADE BY NEHEMIAH Tide Pen Pro Stain Remover](https://theveggieshop.com/p/b0f4htbbpr/) price on Amazon.

**Performance and Effectiveness**  
I’ve tested this little guy on coffee, wine, ketchup (don’t ask), and even chocolate syrup, and it’s surprisingly good at its job. The key is tackling stains before they set in. I followed the instructions and pressed the tip onto the stain to release the cleaning solution, then gently rubbed the area. Most stains began disappearing immediately, though tougher stains like grape juice took slightly longer and required a repeat application. Whether the mess is from a mid-day snack or a glass of red wine, the formula seems to cut through a wide range of stains effortlessly.

**Ease of Use**  
The usability is straightforward. There's no complicated process involved – you just remove excess residue from the stain, press the tip of the pen on the stained area to release the cleaner, and rub it in gently. My clumsy sibling, who swears by convenience products, found it foolproof. No mess on hands, nothing extra to clean up, and the application takes mere seconds. It has made our chaotic family road trips far less stressful when someone (usually me) spills coffee in the car.

**Durability and Product Lifespan**  
The only downside I observed is how quickly the product runs out if you use it frequently. For someone living in an environment prone to spills, a single pen may not last very long. However, for occasional use, it holds up quite well. My coworker, who seems to perpetually have coffee stains, keeps one in her desk and says she's able to stretch a good number of uses out of one pen.

**Advantages**  
- Portable and fits in small spaces  
- Simple, mess-free application process  
- Works on a wide variety of common stains  
- Great for travel, meetings, and emergencies  

**Critiques**  
- Limited lifespan with frequent use  
- Not as effective once stain has fully set  
- Some tougher stains require multiple applications  

**Competing Products**  
There are few similar products in the market, but none match the balance of convenience and effectiveness offered by this stain remover. Generic stain removal wipes can clean stains, but they’re often messy and leave residue. Spray cleaners often require a water source, limiting their portability. The Tide Pen Pro Stain Remover strikes a sweet spot between ease of application and power. That said, if you're tackling deep, set-in stains, something like OxiClean's spray might be a better option to go to, but that's meant for a more thorough cleanup.

**Affordable Quality**  
Overall, the Tide Pen Pro occupies a price point that matches its usefulness. Is it revolutionary? Perhaps not, but it’s unquestionably a handy tool to have when spills and stains inevitably happen. Considering its portable design and ability to work without any external support like water or towels, it’s worth it. The time and embarrassment it saves when out and about make it feel like a solid investment for anyone regularly in public or professional settings. Its pricing is reasonable for the features and benefits it offers.

Okay, let's be real for a second. We all want that extra edge, right? You know, the secret sauce that makes everything just a little bit easier and more effective. It’s like having a cheat code for life! What’s YOUR ""unfair advantage""? Let me share mine first, and trust me, it’s a game changer.

**Drumroll, please...** 🥁 **My secret weapon?** *Morning Routines!* Seriously, if you haven't jumped on this train yet, you’re missing out. Here’s why they work wonders for peak performance:

- **Sets the tone for the day:** Ever notice how a messy morning can lead to a chaotic day? A solid routine gives you that *power-up* feeling, like you've already accomplished something before 9 AM! 

- **Time for yourself:** It's an oasis in a desert of responsibilities. Whether it's meditation, reading, or even just a quiet cup of coffee, it’s your time to recharge.

- **Increases productivity:** When your brain’s already in motion, those daunting tasks seem less terrifying. Plus, it’s way easier to tackle that project when you feel like you've already won a mini battle.

- **Less decision fatigue:** By automating the start of your day, you're preserving mental energy for more important decisions later. Ever heard of the 'paradox of choice'? Too many decisions can overwhelm you, so streamline what you can!

Hang on, I know what you might be thinking: *“But I’m NOT a morning person!”* I used to think the same way, until I realized it’s not about the hour, but about creating a personal ritual that WORKS FOR YOU. It could be an evening wind-down ritual or even a mid-day routine—whatever floats your boat!

Of course, *embracing a routine* takes practice. You might fumble at first, but don't sweat it! Here are a few quick tips to kickstart a routine that feels more like a treat than a chore:

1. **Start small:** Try adding just 5 minutes a day. Maybe spend it journaling or stretching.
2. **Be consistent:** Pick several days a week to follow through. It’s like building your own personal habit fortress!
3. **Celebrate your wins:** Did you stick to your routine for a whole week? Treat yourself! Confidence builds momentum.

So, what about you? What’s your *“unfair advantage”* that supercharges your day? Is it something you’ve crafted or a habit you’ve stolen from a productivity guru? There’s no wrong answer here! Let’s share our secret weapons and see how we can all get a little better together. ✨",1,1755955633.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Just wanted to share a quick post — I’ve been in Sicily for 3 days now and honestly, I’m kinda blown away. Didn’t expect to fall for it so fast.
I landed in Catania and have mostly been exploring the eastern side so far. The food? Insane. Like every random corner place serves something that tastes better than what I’ve had in fancy restaurants back home. Arancini and cannoli are officially my personality now.
Etna was wild — surreal landscape and the views are something else. I did a half-day hike and even that felt like stepping onto another planet. The locals have been super warm and helpful, even with my barely-passable Italian.
Also, shout out to the pace of life here — it’s just slow in the best way. Sitting with a coffee and watching life go by has become my favorite part of the day.

It felt a lot more serious than just a crush or passing attraction. But we both liked each other for years. But then 4 years passed from when we met.

I moved hours away to college because my mom had an addiction and home wasn't safe. He didn't know that's the reason I went. One night I was down for winter break, and he immediately asked me if I'd just heard that weird noise too, and then said he'd be very down to see me. I wanted to say yes so badly, but was going back to school the next morning. I told him honestly that I'd love to but I don't live here anymore, I go to school in X city and don't have a car, no transit from home/school either which was all true, and I didn't think I could make it work right now, and I was really sorry. He said no worries but I'm scared he took it as rejection. It wasn't an excuse at all. I just didn't know how to make it work in a way that was fair to both of us and kept both of us safe from my mom who I was still so ashamed of.

It's been 10 years now and I'm finally able to move back safely. And I still want see him. He was always the only one I really wanted and that's not changed for me. My mom has passed away, I have a career, I've taken care of myself, there's nothing I need or want from him but him. I still want to reach out to him to see if he's at all around and interested in that coffee still. I know that when he asked me it wasn't casual based on our connection not being casual and his guardedness. I know he was vulnerable and what it took for him to reach out that night like he did after 4 years of silence.

But it's been so long and his social media is dead - I can see he still goes online but he has changed his profile photo to a cartoon, hasn't posted anything in 10 years, no new photos with anyone, no tagged photos, no relationship updates, etc. I think he stayed in town and didn't pursue post-secondary but I have no real idea.

The kind where the departure board keeps bumping your flight another hour, and everyone around you is sighing and scrolling through their phones. I grabbed a coffee, found an empty seat, and figured I’d be there a while.

About twenty minutes later, a man about my dad’s age sat down across from me. He looked at me for a second before saying, “You look familiar. Did you ever run track in high school?”

I laughed. “Yeah, years ago. Why?”

He leaned forward. “I thought so. I coached at Lincoln High. You’re—wait—Chris, right? Sprinter, 400 meters?”

I almost dropped my coffee. “No way… Coach Riley?”

He grinned, and suddenly I was seventeen again, lacing up spikes on a spring afternoon. I remembered those brutal practices where I swore I’d quit every week. And I remembered one day in particular, when I actually walked off the track halfway through a workout. He didn’t yell. He just jogged after me, handed me a water bottle, and said quietly, “You don’t have to be the fastest, but don’t rob yourself of finding out how much you can do.”

That sentence carried me through more than races, it stuck with me when I nearly dropped out of college, and even years later when I wanted to give up on projects at work.

We sat in that crowded terminal catching up while flights kept getting delayed. I told him how much that moment had mattered, how I had carried his words with me long after high school. His eyes softened. He said, “You know, coaches rarely get to hear what happens after the finish line. Thank you for telling me.”



When our gate finally opened, we stood up and shook hands. Before leaving, he said, “Funny how life works. Sometimes a small thing we say at the right time becomes a big thing for someone else. You just reminded me of that.”



Walking onto that plane, I felt this strange mix of gratitude and disbelief. Of all the airports, all the flights, all the seats—life sat me down across from the person who once stopped me from quitting.

My school runs classes from 7:30 am to 5pm so a lot of the stuff that I'm doing is independent work, asynchronous or at late hours.

**Research (2 years - 11th and 12th)**  
I was mentored under 2 research programs , Lumiere education and ThinkingBeyondAI, and conducted 2 research projects on AI for intrusion detection systems and Data poisoning in AI security.  
I built prototypes for both projects and I've preprinted them too

**Cybersecurity & AI (3 years 10th, 11th, 12th)**

1. I completed several certifications to gain knowledge about cybersecurity and AI with my most notable achievements being: 2 AI and ML focused nanodegrees on Udacity (funded by AWS), ISC2 CC, and the CRTA (Certified Red Team Analyst) and used this knowledge for both my research and my projects
2. Competed in several online CTF competitions placing in the top 20 for 5 of them thus far. --> I'm planning on doing Pico CTF and the International Cybersecurity Olympiad  next year.
3. I've built 3 cybersecurity related projects - Passion project: AI grooming detection system (I'm registering it for my national science fair next year - I did a research paper on it too but it's still under development) - AI Powered Phishing detection system - AI integrated Homelab

**Debating ( 3 years 9th, 11th, 12th)**

1. I was junior debating representative in 9th grade (I was responsible for communications between the seniors and the juniors as well as recruitment for the team - lol not a wow thing but yeah)
2. 1st division debating team at my school - we made it to the state championships and came 1st overall for 2 consecutive years (11th and 12th). During both years I ranked in the top 5 individual speaker tab (5th in 11th grade and 3rd in 12th grade)
3. Ranked top 10 at the TzWSDC (Tanzania WSDC)
4. Made it on the provincial team for 2025-2026.
5. Debating Captain for 2026

**Chess (10 years)**

1. 1st division chess team (only girl on my team so yay for girl power!)
2. Represented my country at the Africa Youth Chess Championships last year and will represent my home country for the tournament this year in December (the national switch was solely because my country of residence made a new policy that doesn't allow non-citizens to represent the country)
3. Titles: WCM (Woman Candidate master) , AIM (Arena International Master)

**Other**  
Community service - I waitress for an understaffed coffee shop that supports a disability home  
Published author of 3 children's books and donated my books to a children's home.

I'm not asking if I'll get admitted or anything - I know there's no guarantee - I've lived my life and enjoyed high school so I'm proud of myself - just wanted to know if I'll be a good fit for MIT or if I need to apply to a school with a different vibe.  
Academics are good too  
IGCSE: physics, chem, cs, math, english, french --> A\*A\*A\*AAC   
AS levels: physics, math, cs ---> aaa (a is the highest symbol for AS level)  
A level (writing next year) physics, math, cs, further math

Taking the SAT in December

Anyway have a great day!

1my16a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1my16a2/discover_if_the_szhetefu_french_press_coffee/,Discover if the SZHETEFU French Press Coffee Maker Review Matches Your Brewing Needs,"The SZHETEFU 34ozFP-01 French Press Coffee Maker has been my sidekick for the past month, and if there’s one thing I can say, it’s that early mornings feel less like a chore now. French presses have always intrigued me, but this one? It’s in a league of its own. While it has its quirks, the good outweighs the not-so-good by quite a stretch.

**Design That Means Business**

From the moment I unboxed this French press, its sturdy stainless-steel construction immediately grabbed my attention. The sleek black finish adds a touch of elegance that blends seamlessly with my other kitchen gadgets. It feels robust, and it’s clearly designed for more than just polite weekend brunches. The double-wall insulation was a feature I didn’t know I desperately needed; it keeps the coffee warm longer than any other press I’ve used. The 34oz capacity is the sweet spot, perfect for Monday-morning solo vibes or a small gathering with friends. However, beware: its all-metal design does mean fingerprints can show up easily. For someone mildly obsessed with spotless kitchen tools, this required a quick wipe now and then.

**Precision Brewing Brings Out Rich Flavors**

The magic of this French press lies in its precise brewing mechanism. Every morning, I’ve adjusted the steeping time for different beans, experimenting with flavors to find the sweet spot that works for me. Whether it was the rich nuttiness of Brazilian dark roast or a bright Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, this press extracts flavors beautifully. The adjustable brew strength is especially handy and makes it versatile enough even for tea drinkers in my family. My mom, a self-proclaimed tea enthusiast, swears by the way it handles loose-leaf brews.  

**[Check SZHETEFU 34ozFP-01 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0dhqp5lv1/)**

**Durability That Withstands Daily Hustle**

This French press boldly declares, “I’m not easy to break!” Its hefty build ensures it won’t topple over if you’re rushing through your coffee-making process — trust me, I’ve tested this theory on groggy mornings. What truly stands out here is its reusable filter. It’s fine enough to keep out pesky grounds while sturdy enough to handle heavy use. I haven’t noticed any wear and tear on the plunger mechanism yet, which speaks volumes about the quality. On the downside, the press is slightly heavier compared to glass models, making it less ideal for camping trips — unless you’re okay with packing a bit more weight.

**Good Points**

- Durable stainless-steel construction that lasts.  
- Elegant black finish adds class to any kitchen.  
- Double-wall insulation keeps coffee piping hot for a long time.  
- 34oz capacity, perfect for brewing multiple cups.  
- Adjustable brewing for customization of flavor strength.  

**Drawbacks**

- The weight and heft make it less portable for outdoor adventures.  
- Fingerprints and smudges can be visible on the black steel exterior.    

**Cleaning Without Any Hassle**

I’ll admit, cleaning French presses historically wasn’t my favorite chore. Yet, with this one, it’s surprisingly low maintenance. The disassembly is straightforward, and a quick rinse under running water gets the job done most of the time. On days when I felt fancy, I tossed the parts into warm, soapy water, and they came out immaculate. My only gripe is that if I left it sitting with coffee grinds for too long (blame forgetfulness), cleaning required just a tad more effort to ensure no residue was left.

**Market Rivals and Why It Matters**

Comparing this French press to some well-known competitors like Bodum and Frieling reveals interesting insights. Bodum’s glass presses, while visually appealing, lack the durability of this model. I’ve broken two of those in the past — one during a “clumsy spill” and another during transit. On the other hand, Frieling offers a similarly durable option with brushed stainless steel, but it’s noticeably pricier. What sets the SZHETEFU press apart is the balance between styling, performance, and affordability. Plus, the heat retention here is better than both rivals, which makes it an irresistible choice for a slow-coffee lover.

**Smart Spending**

Speaking of affordability, does this press justify its price tag? Absolutely. You’re essentially investing in quality, reliability, and aesthetic appeal. Coffee enthusiasts often spend small fortunes on tools that only slightly enhance their brewing journey. This press, however, strikes a perfect cost-efficiency ratio. It’s a one-time investment that withstands daily use, makes delicious coffee, and saves you from smaller expenses like replacing broken glass parts.

I want to buy mum a couple acres of land in Keral, where she can operate a resort or homestay as this has been a long time dream of hers, so in the next 1-2 years I'm looking to do this.

Would someone mind talking to me about pricing, what documents to look for, if mum needs to live in India and become resident before buying this land in her name, what are the construction costs, etc.

The idea would be (v v important) that the land also generates money, i.e. some small passive income by way of rubber, coffee, tea, pepper, cardamom, etc plantations.

ANY advice will be appreciated as we have never owned or dealt with land before.

If it matters, my mum is from Assam and has lived a lot of her life in Dubai. I was looking primarily at Wayanad because we like warmer weather, but suggestions are welcome. What areas should we be looking to buy in? PS since I will be alone taking the loan for this land, whole thing needs to be done in 75-90 lakh max with a 30 lakh downpayment. Is this feasible, as it seems ok for land areas in Wayanad (2-3 acres + construction).

Also what is the difference between dry and wet land in Kerala, and electricity is not a problem, as we can make do with a diesel generator if phase electricity is not available. What about solar?

I started my business to build something meaningful. Instead, I spent the last few years becoming an expert at copying information from one window and pasting it into another.

It wasn't a sudden change. It was a slow creep. A new lead comes in, you handle it. A new client signs up, you onboard them. At first, it's manageable. But as the business grew, It became the bottleneck. My days were consumed by tiny, mind-numbing tasks that produced zero real value.

My breaking point was a Sunday night. I was on my third coffee, manually sending the same ""just checking in!"" email for the tenth time, and I thought, **""This is insane. I started a business to be free, not to be a digital secretary.**

I knew I needed to automate. But I’m not a coder and I didn't have the budget to hire an assistant just for this So, I tried some popular automation tools Like Zapier and n8n, but they felt like building a Rube Goldberg machine—super complex for a simple task. I needed something that could just... do the thing.

I started experimenting with some of the newer AI tools that can understand plain English commands and interact with your other software. It Take some time but I’ll find one that worked best for me:

* **Emails** → Now automatically go out when a client signs up, so I don’t have to touch it.
* **Payments** → It checks if payments cleared and logs them for me.
* **Reminders** → Clients get a gentle reminder if they don’t send their details in time.

Just those three things gave me back about 10 hours a week. More importantly, it free up my mental space. I don’t wake up thinking “ugh, I forgot to send that email.”

**The lesson I learned is this:** Your time is the most valuable asset you have. If you're spending it on repetitive digital tasks, you're being a manager, not a founder. Automating this stuff isn't about being lazy; it's about being smart with your focus. you don’t need to automate everything. Even automating 2–3 repetitive tasks can save you hours and reduce stress.

1my11sj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1my11sj/should_you_trust_the_best_electric_kettle_dezin/,Should You Trust the Best Electric Kettle DEZIN 8856 Review,"Testing out the DEZIN 8856 Electric Kettle has been a daily adventure, one that transformed my routine tea-making into a more streamlined and precise experience. With its sleek black stainless steel design and thoughtful features, this product has set a high bar for electric kettles. From its 1.7L capacity to the nine adjustable preset temperatures, there's a lot to delve into. Here's my take on how this kettle performs and where it shines—or doesn’t.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first impression of the DEZIN 8856 Electric Kettle is that it looks modern and premium. The black stainless steel finish gives it a classy appearance, making it a perfect fit for minimalist or contemporary kitchens. The durable double-wall design isn’t just about aesthetics—it ensures the exterior remains cool to the touch, a feature I found valuable when I inadvertently brushed against it in a morning rush. At only 2.88 pounds, moving it from counter to table is effortless. The build screams quality with a BPA-free, food-grade stainless steel interior that feels smooth and premium. There’s no lingering odor or taste, which I’ve encountered with less expensive models.

**Performance: Rapid Heating**  
Boiling water has never been quicker in my experience. Thanks to the 1200W heating element, this kettle gets the job done in 5 to 7 minutes without sacrificing precision. Whether it’s for green tea at 175°F or an instant coffee at a roaring boil, tapping the ""SET TEMP"" button feels efficient and user-friendly. The boil-stop function was another surprise highlight. You can halt the boiling process at any time and the kettle keeps the water warm at the designated temperature. This feature truly shines during office hours when I repeatedly brew and refill my cup.  

[Find the best price for DEZIN 8856 Electric Kettle on Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b0d9gdx83l/)  

**Key Benefits**  
- Convenient real-time temperature display on the LED digital screen.  
- Extremely versatile with nine different preset temperature options.  
- Heats water quickly, making those morning school runs or last-minute tea urges hassle-free.  
- Comfortable to handle and durable with its dual-wall design.  

**Keep Warm and Memory Function**  
One of the standout features of this kettle is the 12-hour keep-warm functionality. Whether hosting a weekend family brunch or simply leaving it on for regular tea breaks throughout the day, this feature has been a lifesaver. It eliminates the constant re-boiling of water, ensuring efficiency. Additionally, the memory function remembers the last set temperature, saving time compared to resetting it daily. This memory feature seems small but quickly turns into a much-loved convenience once you’re accustomed to it.

**Safety Measures**  
After using countless kitchen gadgets, I’ve developed a strong appreciation for products that put safety first. The DEZIN kettle sports automatic shut-off, boil-dry protection, and over-temperature control. I ran a little “what-if” experiment by powering the kettle without water, and the boil-dry protection worked like a charm, switching it off promptly. Knowing this safety net exists makes it ideal for homes with children or absent-minded users like me.

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The painted finish, while attractive, might show signs of wear over time if not cleaned carefully.  
- The lid mechanism occasionally feels slightly stiff, which requires extra attention during cleaning or refilling.  
- A power cord that’s a tad shorter than expected could limit placement options in tight counter spaces.  

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing the DEZIN 8856 Electric Kettle to its competitors, such as well-known brands like Breville or Cuisinart, reveals both similarities and differences. For instance, the Breville kettles come with a comparable temperature control system but at a steeper price. Cuisinart offers slightly better warranty terms and is known for its ergonomic designs. However, neither seem to offer the 12-hour keep-warm feature that I’ve grown so dependent on. While the DEZIN kettle doesn’t boast the same brand recognition, its affordable yet feature-packed profile gives it a competitive edge over these bigger names.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Value for money is where this kettle really stands out among the crowd. For a product offering nine temperature presets, rapid boil capabilities, and long-duration keep-warm features, it feels astonishingly well-priced compared to its premium counterparts. Given how often I’ve found myself using it in a day, the investment feels justified. It’s a dependable aid for someone who appreciates precision brewing and efficiency.

1my0zt8,https://i.redd.it/gvjpjsfwprkf1.png,Start Your Day with Gratitude: Unlock the Power of a Positive Morning,"# Start Your Day with Gratitude: Unlock the Power of a Positive Morning

How you begin your morning sets the tone for the rest of your day. If you wake up rushed, stressed, or distracted, those feelings often carry through every task and interaction. But when you start your day with gratitude, you shift your mindset toward positivity, peace, and joy—no matter what challenges lie ahead.

# The Science Behind Gratitude

Studies show that practicing gratitude can improve mental health, reduce stress, and increase overall happiness. When you focus on what you have instead of what you lack, your brain releases “feel-good” chemicals like dopamine and serotonin. This creates a ripple effect that boosts your mood and helps you approach the day with greater optimism.

# Simple Morning Gratitude Practices

You don’t need an hour-long routine to feel the benefits of gratitude. Even small, intentional moments can transform your day. Here are a few ideas to try:

* **Keep a gratitude journal** – Write down three things you’re thankful for each morning.
* **Say thank you before getting out of bed** – Acknowledge the gift of a new day.
* **Practice mindful moments** – Enjoy your morning coffee, sunrise, or quiet time with appreciation.
* **Affirmations of gratitude** – Speak words like, *“I am grateful for this day and the opportunities it brings.”*

# Gratitude Shifts Perspective

Life isn’t always perfect, but gratitude teaches us to see the beauty in the little things: the laughter of a loved one, the warmth of sunlight, or even the opportunity to try again after yesterday’s struggles. By focusing on the positives, challenges become lessons, and ordinary moments turn into blessings.

# Spread Gratitude to Others

Gratitude isn’t only for yourself—it’s a gift you can share. Thank someone for their kindness, express appreciation to a co-worker, or simply smile at a stranger. When you share gratitude, you multiply its impact and inspire others to carry that energy forward.

✨ *Remember: Gratitude is more than a practice—it’s a way of life. Start each morning by acknowledging your blessings, and you’ll discover that every day holds more joy, peace, and possibility than you imagined.*",1,1755954436.0,PositiveMindsetDaily,0,1.0,False

I’ve been testing the Culligan RFC-BBSA 25 Micron Whole House Water Filter for some time now, and its sturdy plastic construction immediately stands out. The material doesn’t feel cheap, and the filter's dimensions of 4.5"" x 4.5"" x 9.5"" make it compact while still maintaining a functional size for whole-house filtration. It’s white in color with a sleek, practical design, which fits seamlessly into most setups. As someone who’s remodeled my home water system a few times, finding a filter that balances durability and aesthetics is a rare win.  

**Straightforward Installation Process**  
Installation was very manageable. Even someone with moderate DIY skills can set up this replacement filter for compatible systems, such as the HD-950A housing unit, within no time. I did, however, find that following the provided instructions closely was crucial for a proper plate mount. The mounting type ensures it stays secure, and I experienced no leaks once installed. The fact that it doesn’t require additional tools or parts made the process quick—something even my less-than-handy cousin appreciated after setting one up at his place.  

[Find the best price for Culligan RFC-BBSA on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b000bqn6mm/)

**Exceptional Water Filtration Capabilities**  
What initially drew me to this filter was its ability to remove impurities efficiently. It can trap particles as fine as 25 microns while maintaining a consistent flow rate of 3 gallons per minute. As someone living in an older house with pipes subject to rust, sediment, and scale buildup, this feature has been a lifesaver. You can actually see the difference in water clarity and taste, especially when making coffee or showering. It filters out chlorine odor and taste remarkably well too. However, high-sediment water might reduce the longevity slightly, so keep an eye on your water's quality.  

**Positives**  
- High filtration efficiency, even for extra-fine sediment.  
- Compatible with a broad range of systems.  
- Noticeable improvement in water taste and clarity.  

**Negatives**  
- Service life can diminish faster in high-sediment conditions.  
- It is only a single filter in the pack, requiring frequent replacements for larger households.  

**Filter Longevity and Performance Over Time**  
One of the highlights of this filter is its reasonable lifespan. It’s rated for up to three months or 5,000 gallons of water. However, that’s contingent on your water quality. In areas with heavier sediment, you’ll notice it clogging up sooner, which was the case when I tested it at my friend’s rural property. Still, extending the lifespan of household appliances like washing machines by reducing sediment makes the trade-off worthwhile.  

**Competing Products**  
There are quite a few options on the market when it comes to whole-house water filters, but not all measure up. For example, a popular competitor, the GE FXHTC, offers similar filtration but doesn’t perform as well in eliminating fine sediment. Systems like the Whirlpool WHKF-GD25BB are priced similarly but lack the quality certification this model has under NSF/ANSI standards. While both of these alternatives are decent options, I found the Culligan filter better optimized for reducing both rust and chlorine taste—a noticeable difference when comparing them side by side.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering the benefits and the reasonable performance-to-cost ratio, the Culligan filter feels like smart spending. You might find cheaper options, but those often compromise on material or certification, leaving you with less effective filtration. While it could be tempting to choose a multi-pack from other brands, I found the reliability here worth the single-filter price. Replacing your filter every 2-3 months or after approximately 10,000 gallons of use doesn’t feel like a hassle given the impact on overall water quality.

1my0wtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1my0wtg/consistent_palpatations/,Consistent Palpatations,"Hi there. 29M. I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me to deal with my palpatations. 

I have palpatations consistent with what is described as PVCs.. beat, long pause.. then a strong second beat.

I started having these symptoms during a stressful time of my life back in Nov 24 while having tonnes of coffee and probably not enough water. They came on like a freight train. I then had a break for a few months, then they came on heavily during Feb when i was diagnosed with costo following what doctors think was a viral infection.

Since, I have them every week. Sometimes they flare up so bad I have them every second / third beat. But get this, lying down helps my palpatations calm. I have had an ECG, bloods and two X rays all came back clear. Im waiting for a holter monitor but ive been on the waiting list for ages. Ive been prescribed SSRIs to deal with the stress of it all.

I still get tight pain in the left of my chest associated with costo. Im scared the palpatations irritate my heart and my chest. 

Its really hard to calm my nerves when my nerves are associated with the palpatations. If I wasnt having palpatations, I wouldn't be anxious. It's a real struggle being on my feet and motivating myself to have a normal day when I know that I won't have nearly as much of a burden if im lying down. Im usually an active, fit male. Cycling, running and on my feet with my job.

Any advice on how to deal with these palpatations or with the stress of it all? Purely skipped beats, no other symptoms aside from costo related symptoms. Im really starting to lose hope.

She was diagnosed last winter. We knew she had some sort of dementia for a few years, but neither she nor my father would cooperate to get her tested, get help, etc. They blamed everything on post Covid symptoms. That mindset has continued in every possible way, so the last year has been exhausting.

She also has a lot of hallucinations. Most of the time they are pleasant, or at least harmless. Like talking to her (late) mother, or old ladies stopping by for a cup of coffee. Sometimes they are horrible, ""scary men with yellow teeth"" that come out at night to sexually assault her. She also wakes up several times a night, thinking that she has been called in and must rush to the hospital where she used to work. Most of the time, she is just annoyed with ""all the people"" walking through their flat, blocking the TV or the like. 

One such instance occurred the other day when I spoke to my father on the phone, and I heard her yelling in the background. 

Mother: [Father's name], call the police! There are six people in the bathroom and I need to pee! 

Father: There is no one in there! Just go pee! 

Mother, in despair: Why do WE in particular need to have a public bathroom?! 

Hard to hear, difficult to cope with. I was sad. But when I told my wife about it, I lost it. I laughed so much that my stomach started to hurt. How bizarre the comment about the public bathroom was, and I kept thinking that she was actually a bit unfair calling the police on the people just using it. 

At first I felt a bit guilty, but that quickly turned into some sort of relief. We are well past the point where this saga ends with any sort of dignity, so I just... laughed.

Context: I am not anemic but I am iron deficient and feel like shit most of the time for the past two years and my ferritin has stayed around 18-19. Obviously I don't know if low ferritin is the cause of my problems, and I don't know how long it's been that low, I only tested it for the first time maybe 1.5 years ago. I supplemented with ferrous sulfate for a while but it did nothing but mess up my stomach. Then I supplemented with a whole bottle of Thorne iron bisglycinate (not all at once) which did nothing - still at 19. Last time I tested three months ago I was at 19.

After that, I got fed up and adopted a stricter iron protocol. Here's what I did, although I was honestly not always consistent with it.

* Iron supplement: 50mg Thorne iron bisglycinate every other day on an empty stomach in the morning. Or sometimes I take ProFerrin heme iron 10.5mg instead, particularly if I'm drinking coffee soon after because I heard heme iron absorption is less affected by caffeine
* Vit C: 1000mg Thorne Ascorbic Acid most days I take iron, so about every other day
* Vit D: Sports Research D3 + K2 maybe twice a week, taken when I take iron + vit C
* Magnesium glycinate: taken once or twice a week at bedtime
* Sometimes a B complex, although mine had niacin in it which was giving me bad niacin flush, so I don't take that one much at all
* incorporate more red meat into diet
* no gluten (or low gluten. this one was hard to always keep)

FYI, all of my other vitamin levels like D, C, B, Mag are fine. D was borderline low once. I'm excited to see if I can raise my ferritin levels even more, targeting around 100. I'll probably retest in about 6 months. Honestly I feel like cutting out gluten may have been a big factor, and has also probably helped me feel better in general and helped my gut feel better.",4,1755953508.0,Anemic,3,1.0,False

1my0htg,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayUpgrades/comments/1my0htg/why_choose_the_cuisinart_elemental_food_processor/,Why Choose the Cuisinart Elemental Food Processor ECH-4GM?,"Cuisinart ECH-4GM Elemental Chopper Grinder has been a game-changer in my kitchen routine. This 4-cup food processor is compact, efficient, and practical, which makes it perfect for everyday cooking tasks. I felt compelled to share my experience with it, including its merits and drawbacks, as I’ve been using it daily for weeks now to prepare everything from quick meals to elaborate recipes.

**Compact Yet Functional Design**  
The Cuisinart ECH-4GM strikes the right balance between sleek aesthetics and functionality. Its gunmetal color looks great on my countertop, and its dimensions – 5.6""D x 7.2""W x 9.29""H – make it easy to store even in smaller kitchens. Even with its compact size, the 4-cup capacity bowl feels ample for most tasks. I really appreciated the clear markings on the bowl and the grippy handle, which made food prep straightforward and convenient.

**Performance and Features**  
One standout feature is the patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade. I found the sharp edge particularly useful for delicate chopping tasks like garlic cloves, while the blunt edge handled tougher grinding jobs like coffee beans or spices. The two-speed touchpad controls are simple but effective, giving just enough options without being overly complicated. I used the high-speed setting to grind nuts for baking, while the low setting worked well for chopping softer vegetables. What sets this product apart is the exclusive BladeLock system that secures the blade during both processing and pouring.

[Check Cuisinart ECH-4GM price on Amazon.](https://grillsbbq.com/p/b0749t5kgc/)

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Cleanup is a breeze with this chopper. According to the specs, all removable components are dishwasher safe, and I can confirm this to be true. After several uses making pesto, salsa, and purées, I tossed the bowl, lid, and blade into the dishwasher, and they came out spotless every time. Alternatively, if you prefer handwashing or need a quick rinse mid-prep, the surfaces are easy to clean with minimal effort. It’s worth noting that the instruction manual emphasizes proper placement of the parts for safety, which is something to keep in mind.

**Positives**  
This product really shines when it comes to versatility and ease of use.  
- The auto-reversing blade is ideal for handling a range of textures.  
- Small yet spacious design fits most storage spaces.  
- Simple touchpad controls make it beginner and user-friendly.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
That said, no product is without its flaws.  
- It’s somewhat loud when processing tougher ingredients, which could be a nuisance in a quieter household.  
- The 4-cup capacity might feel limiting for larger family meals.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing it to other small food processors, the Cuisinart ECH-4GM holds its own. The KitchenAid Mini Food Processor, for instance, is slightly sleeker in design but lacks the auto-reversing blade feature, making it less efficient with tougher grinding tasks. On the other hand, the Ninja Express Chop can handle similar tasks but doesn’t offer dishwasher-safe components, which was a deal-breaker for me. The Cuisinart model emerges as a versatile, easy-to-clean choice.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering the features offered, this chopper provides strong financial value for its price point. I examined other appliances within its category, and while some are marginally cheaper or more expensive, this one ticks all the right boxes for performance, quality, and ease of maintenance. If you’re someone who regularly prepares fresh meals, this is an investment worth making.

I decided to get to know more about the business to see what it does (since I had another Linkedin connection but with a guy I knew from a friend actually committing to his healthcare business). 

After a bit of talking, he invited me to have a coffee chat today at Aperia Mall at 3pm as he said he had other appointments that day. I felt it would be quite far away as I live in the north and I had to teach tuition at 5pm also in the north but decided to reschedule the meeting to 2:30 and go there to talk about what his business is about. 

Basically we shared more about our common goals and I told him I wanted financial freedom and the opportunity to become a startup owner (that isn’t my main goal btw). He also shared this thing called the ESBI quadrant and how you want to build leverage and then talked about a mentorship program if I am recruited and a zoom seminar that happens on Tuesday. After that, he sent me some materials on networking marketing and a Rich Dad book.

Because of the Rich Dad book which is common in MLM recruitment, I decided to look more into it and found out that Amway recruiters commonly send this book to people they try to recruit. Then I googled Amway and guess what, they literally sell healthcare and fitness products.

Pretty sure I’m getting recruited by Amway to participate in an MLM. Just before writing this post, I also saw another post on this subreddit about MLMs and guess what, they were approached by someone from Nutrilite which has a store in Aperia Mall.

The final straw? I looked into his Linkedin profile again bc if he had a legitimate side business, he would put it on his Linkedin profile that he was working there but he basically had nothing about it, only saying he was a SMU biz student.

1my0b1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1my0b1a/i_had_to_abandon_my_apartment_after_what_i/,I Had to Abandon My Apartment After What I Recorded at Night,"I still don’t know how to explain what happened without sounding insane, but I need to get it out before I forget pieces of it. I deleted and rewrote this three times because every version sounds too neat, like something someone would script. This is how it really felt, messy and half-remembered.

For context, I live alone on the top floor of an old apartment building. The landlord is a guy who never fixes anything right, the pipes clank like they’re having their own conversations, and the hallway light flickers in the exact same pattern every night. I work night shifts at a supermarket so I sleep during the day. It’s a weird schedule, but it paid the bills and kept me isolated, which I kind of liked.

A few weeks ago I came home around 8 a.m., exhausted, and passed out on the couch. I had my phone on the coffee table and a podcast still playing on the speaker at a low volume. I woke up two hours later because the podcast cut out mid-sentence. The speaker had switched itself to radio static and there was a faint thumping coming from my bedroom wall, like someone knocking lightly but rhythmically. I thought it was the neighbors, but the knocks were three quick taps, a pause, then two slow ones. It felt deliberate.

I got up, wrapped a blanket around my shoulders, and went to my bedroom door. The knocks stopped the moment I reached it. I listened for a while. In an old building you get good at guessing where sounds come from so you can blame them on something normal. This time the noise was inside the room, like someone was on the other side of the wall that my headboard touched. The radiator hissed. The building settled. I laughed at myself and went back to the living room, but I couldn’t get comfortable.

That night I couldn’t sleep properly. Every time I drifted off I had this impression someone was standing at the foot of the bed watching me sleep. Not an intruder feeling, more like a weight. I chalked it up to exhaustion and slept for a few hours before my alarm for work went off. The weirdness stuck like a taste in my mouth, soft and persistent.

Over the next week the knocks became regular. Always three quick, pause, two slow. Always when I was trying to fall asleep. I taped a note to the wall on a whim, childish, like an experiment. “If that’s you, knock once.” I laughed at myself putting it there and kind of expected nothing. That night, three quick, pause, two slow. Then one sharp, single tap right in the middle of the night. The note was still where I put it in the morning.

I started recording. My phone sat on the bedside table as I fell asleep. In the morning the file would be full of room noise and, a few hours in, a single, unmistakable phrase caught by the microphone. It was not words exactly, more like syllables dragged low through the pipes. Sometimes it sounded like “here,” sometimes “stay,” sometimes nothing I could pin down. Once, clearer than anything before, it sounded like my name.

When something crosses that line between coincidence and intent, you change. I began to leave lights on, to keep my phone plugged in, to check the door twice. I would wake up tangled in the blanket and see the shape of a person in the corner for a second, then it would be gone. I told myself it was a combination of the radio static, the building settling, and sleep deprivation. I told my friend over text and he made some jokes and told me to move out. That night the knocks were slower, deliberate, very close.

The next morning I found scratches on the wall behind the headboard. Small, like fingernails, forming no word I could read. I remember touching them, how cold the plaster felt under my fingers. I didn’t tell anyone. I bought a cheap plug-in recorder and left it running all day and night for three days. When I listened back I heard normal daytime sounds, the city, the kettle, the neighbor’s door slamming. At 3:12 a.m. on the second night there was a breathing sound on the file, not mine. It matched the rhythm I’d felt when I couldn’t sleep. The audio then cut, and the last thirty seconds is nothing but a low, sustained noise that made my teeth ache when I played it through headphones.

I started seeing small things move in the corner of my eye. A chair slightly shifted, a picture frame turned face down, my phone would be angled differently on the table when I woke up than when I fell asleep. I began setting silly traps. I placed small objects on the floor—bottle caps, a pen—and checked them in the morning. Sometimes they were in the same place. Once, the pen was gone and there were three deep dents in the carpet where it must have been pressed.

I thought about the rational options: mice, sleepwalking, an asshole neighbor. I filmed myself asleep to catch me getting up, but the footage never showed the motion I expected. The nights I played the footage back, I watched myself lie perfectly still while something in the room shifted the way my ear hears a sound move across space. In one clip the blanket flutters as if by a breeze, but the window is closed, the AC off. Something passes over the camera’s lens, a shadow like fabric, but thicker, like a shawl dragged very slowly.

The last straw was my phone. I woke up at 4 a.m. and checked it because the static on the radio had become a background hum in my skull. There were three unread voice messages. I don’t leave my phone to record by the bed, someone else had to have left them there. Each message was thirty seconds of nothing. No voice, nothing, until the very end where a breath exhaled right into the microphone and something said, clearly, “Don’t leave.”

I packed a bag. I told myself I would go to a friend’s place for a night and then decide. When I opened my closet to grab a jacket the coat hanger scraped against the wood like fingernails. There are marks along the inside of the closet door now, parallel, like someone traced the length of the frame with their nails. I didn’t take them for granted.

I left. I didn’t look back. I slept at my friend’s place on a couch that smelled faintly of cigarettes and felt a stupid relief. In the morning I texted myself a reminder to go back and get the rest of my things, and when I opened my phone the text showed as delivered at 5:03 a.m. the night before, timestamped while I was on the couch, asleep.

I never went back. The landlord called once asking if I’d left the keys. He sounded like he was reading a script. I still get the impulse to check the thread of messages I left myself that night because I think they will contain some explanation, a clue I missed. But I stopped listening to the recordings. I don’t want to hear the breath at the end. I don’t want to hear anything that sounds like my own name said by someone who is not me.

If you think I could just be dramatic, go back and read the timestamps on your own messages. Ask anyone who lives in an old building how easy it is to believe your walls are just settling, until they are not. I don’t know what was in my apartment. Maybe it was loneliness given teeth. Maybe it was the house itself, tired of being a box. Maybe it was something that learned how to imitate the pauses between my breaths.

I have a copy of the last audio file saved in a folder I never open. Sometimes at night, when the world is quiet and my phone is on the table, I imagine three quick taps, a pause, two slow. It feels like a pulse now, like a metronome marking time for something that learned the pattern of my sleep. I keep telling myself I was lucky to leave when I did, but sometimes I wake up and for one breath I am still on that couch, and I feel the weight at the foot of the bed, and the world narrows to a single, impossible voice saying, “Stay.”",2,1755952573.0,nosleep,1,0.75,False

I’ve been trying to track down a short social awareness video/PSA I saw online many years ago (probably sometime in the 2010s, but it could have been a bit earlier or later). I’ll describe it as best as I can:

	•	The ad was about domestic violence.
	•	We see an elderly woman’s hands holding a cup of tea or coffee. Her hands are trembling.
	•	In the background, a middle-aged man (likely her son) is putting on his coat and getting ready to leave.
	•	Once the man leaves the house and the door closes, the woman’s hands suddenly stop shaking. She calms down.
	•	I don’t remember any dialogue, but there was definitely sound — especially the sound of the door closing. Possibly also music.
	•	I’m fairly sure there was text at the end, maybe a support hotline number or a website.
	•	The video was short, maybe 20–30 seconds long.
	•	I originally saw it on the internet (not TV).
	•	I always thought it might have been from a Scandinavian country, but it could also have been Russian or from another European country.

Does anyone here remember this PSA or know where I could find it? Any hints (title, organization, country, or a mirror upload) would be super helpful.

1my05gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1my05gf/delve_into_whether_sprayway_glass_cleaner_truly/,Delve Into Whether Sprayway Glass Cleaner Truly Leaves No Streaks,"**A Glass Cleaner That Lives Up to Its Reputation**

Sprayway’s SW050 Glass Cleaner has proven itself a reliable companion for my daily cleaning tasks. Whether tackling grimy mirrors in the bathroom or fingerprint-laden windows in the living room, this product consistently delivers a streak-free finish. As someone who’s tested countless household cleaning items, I was eager to see how this particular 19-ounce, 4-pack set would stack up. Spoiler alert: it didn’t disappoint. 

My first impression? This spray means business. The can feels sturdy and sprays evenly over any glass surface, distributing a light mist rather than drenching the area. The residue-free formula immediately caught my attention as I wiped the cleaner off; not a single streak was left behind, even in sunlight. It’s also refreshing to find a product like this that’s completely ammonia-free, sparing my lungs the harsh fumes you’d typically expect. 

**Perks**

- Leaves surfaces absolutely streak-free.
- Formulated without ammonia, making it family-friendly for spaces children frequent.
- Comes in a practical, cost-effective 4-pack for frequent users.

[Check Sprayway SW050 price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b07qbmzvy1/)

**Ease of Use**

The simplicity of the spray bottle design is something I quickly appreciated. With an ergonomic nozzle, applying the cleaner is nearly effortless, even during prolonged cleaning sessions. Unlike some other products I’ve tried (and there have been many), this cleaner doesn’t leave an oily film behind—just a clear, shiny surface. Whether it’s delicate glass coffee tables or the fragile panes in old picture frames, this performs well on a variety of surfaces. It even works wonders on car windows, adding an extra layer of convenience to its usage.

**Impressive Performance**

Most products make lofty claims about their effectiveness, but with the Sprayway SW050, its performance genuinely stands out. On heavily smudged windows—a scene of fingerprints courtesy of my nieces—it cut through the grime with minimal effort. I won’t lie; I was skeptical when faced with particularly greasy stovetop glass panels. But just a few sprays, combined with a microfiber cloth, worked wonders.

That said, I’d argue you need to pair this cleaner with a good-quality cloth. I tried a standard paper towel at first, and while the result was still decent, upgrading to microfiber gave an entirely streakless appearance. Even with high expectations based on customer reviews, I was thoroughly impressed by the consistent results.

**Key Benefits**

- Extremely effective on both light smudges and heavy grime.
- Adaptable for both indoor and outdoor glass surfaces.
- Prevents the build-up of streaks in less time compared to competitors.

**Drawbacks**

Amidst all its strengths, there are a couple of things I noticed that could be improved. 

- Sized at 19 ounces, I went through a can quicker than anticipated when tackling heavier cleaning tasks for multiple windows.
- The spray nozzle occasionally requires a bit of finesse to keep the mist evenly distributed, especially as the can nears empty.

**Competing Products**

When comparing the Sprayway SW050 to other glass cleaners like Windex or Invisible Glass, it excels in several areas—particularly the lack of that ammonia smell that hangs in the air long after you’re done cleaning with other products. Windex does offer effective cleaning capabilities too but struggles to maintain streak-free results without additional dry wipes. Meanwhile, Invisible Glass holds its own in terms of residue-free application but costs more when purchased in bulk. The Sprayway cleaner manages to balance cost, usability, and performance seamlessly, making it a standout among everyday choices.

**Value for Money**

From a price-to-quality perspective, Sprayway SW050 feels worth every penny. The 4-pack ensures I always have a backup on hand, even during deep-cleaning seasons like spring cleaning. This level of reliability and convenience could make it a preferred choice for anyone looking to upgrade their household cleaning routines without exceeding budget constraints. Whether it’s professional cleaners taking on larger tasks or everyday households aiming for impeccable results, this product fills the bill beautifully.

\-@clowbranded74 postsmore on music collabsThought for 8sHey there! Since you're digging into more on music collabs with@clowbranded(aka C-LoW), I'll break it down based on what I know from his online vibes and posts. He's all about that creative energy, so let's dive in:Who is@clowbrandedand His Music Scene?

* Background: C-LoW (real handle@clowbranded) is a musician hailing from Coos Bay, Oregon. He's a working artist who balances day jobs with music production, often sharing raw, passionate tracks inspired by life, dreams (like those alien revelations he rants about), and social issues like fighting homelessness. His style blends indie vibes with experimental sounds—think lo-fi beats, introspective lyrics, and a touch of psychedelic edge.
* Online Presence: Active on platforms like Twitter/X, SoundCloud, and Instagram, where he posts snippets, behind-the-scenes, and calls for collabs. He's got that grassroots hustle, rallying fans to vote on tracks or share his stuff.

His Take on Music CollabsFrom his recent posts and interactions, C-LoW is super open to collaborations—it's like his love language for building the music community. Here's the scoop:

* What He's Into: He's hyping up joint projects right now, especially with producers, vocalists, or even visual artists for music videos. Recent tweets show him vibing with ideas like remixing tracks with guest features or co-writing songs about real-world topics (e.g., crypto dreams mixed with social justice anthems). He mentioned wanting to collab on something ""out-of-this-world"" tied to his alien fascination—maybe a sci-fi themed EP?
* Recent Vibes: In one thread, he shouted out Rihanna as an inspiration (dreaming of a feature? Who knows!), and he's been teasing crypto-inspired beats. He's all about remote collabs too—sharing stems via Dropbox or Discord for folks worldwide. No gatekeeping here; he encourages DMs for ideas.
* Examples of His Collab Style:
   * Past/Teased Projects: He's done informal collabs with local Oregon artists, like layering vocals over beats for free mixtapes. One standout was a track with a fellow indie rapper on homelessness awareness—super heartfelt and community-driven.
   * Current Calls: He's posting things like ""Who's down to collab on a beat drop that slaps harder than my coffee addiction? Tag your producers! #MusicCollab #ClowbrandedVibes"". If you're a musician, hit him up—he's responsive and all about mutual growth.

How to Get Involved

* Reach Out: Slide into his Twitter/X DMs (@clowbranded) or check his SoundCloud for open collab invites. He's mentioned using tools like Splice for sample sharing.
* Why Collab with Him?: Low-pressure, high-creativity. Plus, he's got that underdog story—your input could help amplify his (and your) voice on bigger platforms. He's even tying it to causes, like donating proceeds from collab tracks to anti-homelessness orgs.
* Pro Tip: If you're into Rihanna-level pop with a twist, or crypto-fueled electronic stuff, align your pitch there. He's all about positive energy and ""vibing"" together.

The Wren groaned as its grapples strained against the mass of the broken shuttle. Elias Calder muttered to himself, hands dancing across the console like he was coaxing an old dog out of a ditch.



“C’mon, Birdie. Just a little more bite. She’s not gonna fly herself.”



The shuttle was scorched, half-crushed, spinning slowly in the black. No registry. No known design. Alien, but not hostile. Just… lost.



After an hour of maneuvering, the Wren’s cargo bay sealed with a heavy thud. The shuttle was aboard.



Elias suited up. Not because he had to—but because it felt right. Like armor for grief.



Inside the wreck, the air was thin. The walls were slick with coolant and blood. He found the adult first—slumped over the controls, body twisted, eyes open but empty. Humanoid, but not human. Skin like pearl, hair like silver thread.



And then he heard it.



A soft, high-pitched whimper. Like a bird caught in a vent.



He turned, flashlight sweeping across the cabin—and there she was.



A child. Maybe three years old. Curled in a blanket of strange fibers. Her face was almost human: delicate features, wide eyes, faint bioluminescent freckles glowing like starlight. She looked up at him, silent, trembling.



Elias knelt slowly.



“Hey there, little one. You’re safe now.”



She didn’t speak. Just reached out and touched his glove.



🪐 The Burial

Elias didn’t know the rites. Didn’t know the name. But he knew what respect looked like.



He cleared a space in the Wren’s observation bay—a quiet corner with a view of the stars. Wrapped the body in a clean tarp. Placed a wrench beside it, because it felt right. Lit a small flame. Said nothing.



The child watched from a distance, clutching a blanket. She didn’t cry. Just stared, eyes glowing faintly.



Elias looked up at the stars.



“I don’t know who you were. But you mattered. And I’ll make sure she knows that.”



🌠 The Farewell Fire

Elias stood in the Wren’s launch bay, the adult’s body sealed inside a ceremonial capsule. The design was simple—no insignia, no flag. Just a smooth shell with a guidance beacon and a burn-sequence core. It would flare bright as it neared the star, a final blaze before silence.



He’d wrapped the body himself. Carefully. Respectfully. The alien’s features were still, peaceful now. Elias had placed a wrench beside the body—not for utility, but for meaning. A symbol of work, of effort, of trying.



The child watched from the viewport, silent. Her eyes glowed faintly, reflecting the launch rail’s amber lights.



Elias keyed in the trajectory. Virell, the old sun, loomed ahead—golden, patient, waiting.



“I don’t know your name,” he said softly, “but I’ll send you to the light. That’s what we do now. No graves. No tombs. Just fire and stars.”



The capsule locked into place. A low hum filled the chamber.



He pressed the ignition.



With a hiss and a flash, the capsule launched—cutting through the void like a comet. It would drift for days, then ignite in the corona. A flare. A memory.



The child pressed her hand to the glass. Elias stood beside her, helmet off, heart heavy.



“He mattered,” Elias whispered. “And you do too.”



🛠️ Chapter Two: Birdie and the Girl

The Wren was old. Not ancient, but seasoned—patched hull, scorched plating, a cockpit that smelled faintly of oil and coffee. Elias had flown her through asteroid fields, solar flares, and one regrettable wedding on Titan. She’d earned her nickname: Birdie. Not because she was graceful, but because she always came home.



The girl didn’t speak yet. But she listened.



Elias showed her the ship slowly. Patiently. Like a father teaching a child to walk.



“This here’s the nav console. Birdie’s brain. She’s smarter than she looks, but don’t tell her I said that.”



The girl touched the screen, eyes wide. It flickered with star maps and old flight logs.



“And this—this is the galley. Not much, but it’ll make soup. Or something soup-adjacent.”



He cooked for her. Cleaned her. Wrapped her in a blanket stitched from old Earth fibers. Told her stories while she ate.



📖 Tales from the Dirtball

Elias had a voice like gravel and honey. He told her about Earth—not the politics or the wars, but the feel of it.



“There was a place called Montana. Big sky. You could lie on your back and see forever. My dad used to say the stars were holes punched in heaven’s roof.”



“And there was music. Real music. Guitars and voices and heartbreak. Not just synth loops and orbital noise.”



“We had birds, too. Real ones. Sparrows, crows, robins. Birdie’s named after them. Because she’s stubborn and loud and always finds her way.”



The girl didn’t understand the words yet. But she understood the rhythm. The warmth. The way Elias looked at her—not like a mystery, but like a miracle.



He taught her to say Birdie. It came out soft and slurred, but it was hers.



“Birdie,” she whispered one night, pointing at the ship.



Elias smiled. Not the kind you fake. The kind that breaks you a little.



“That’s right, sweetheart. She’s ours now.”





🌌 Chapter Three: Pawpaw

Days passed. Maybe weeks. Time aboard the Wren wasn’t measured in hours—it was measured in meals shared, systems checked, stories told.



Elias and the girl fell into rhythm.



She followed him through the ship like a shadow—barefoot, silent, curious. He taught her how to check the coolant levels, how to listen for the hum of the reactor core, how to pat Birdie’s console twice before sleep.



“She’s old,” he’d say, “but she’s got heart. Like me.”



The girl didn’t speak much. But she watched. Learned. And one morning, while Elias was fixing a jammed hatch, she padded up behind him and said it:



“Pawpaw.”



He froze.



Not “Captain.” Not “Elias.” Not “Mister.”



Just Pawpaw.



The word hit him like a solar flare to the chest. He didn’t turn around. Didn’t let her see the tears welling up in his eyes. But his voice cracked when he answered.



“Well now… that’s a name I haven’t heard in a long time.”



He laughed. Not loud. Not forced. Just soft and real.



“You can call me that, sweetheart. You earned it.”



She smiled. A small, glowing thing. And he let her hear the joy in his voice, even as he wiped his face with a grease-stained rag.



📡 Chapter Four: The Signal

The shuttle was cold. Elias had rigged a portable generator to power the interior—just enough juice to run diagnostics, maybe salvage a few systems. He didn’t expect much. The wreck had been silent since the day he pulled it aboard.



But tonight, something changed.



He was elbow-deep in a panel, tracing wires, when the generator surged. A soft whine turned into a sharp ping. Then a voice—garbled, alien, looping.



“—distress—coordinates—breach—”



Elias froze.



The shuttle’s comms array had come online. Not just online—broadcasting. A distress call. Old, automated, but still active. It was punching out into the void, loud and clear.



“—evacuation—hostile—child—preserve—”



He scrambled to the console, fingers flying. The interface was foreign, symbols half-deciphered from weeks of study. The call kept looping, louder now, echoing through Birdie’s hull.



“—preserve—preserve—preserve—”



Elias slammed the override. The signal cut.



Silence returned.



He stood there, breathing hard, staring at the console. The message had been transmitting for minutes. Maybe longer. Long enough for someone—something—to hear.



He looked toward the corridor. The girl was still asleep, curled in her blanket, unaware.



“What the hell were you running from?” he whispered.



🛠️ Chapter Five: Pawpaw’s Oath

The broadcast had stopped. The silence returned. But something had shifted.



Elias sat in the shuttle’s cockpit, staring at the dark console. The girl—his littlelady—was asleep back in Birdie, curled up with a blanket and a wrench she’d claimed as her own.



He didn’t know who might’ve heard the signal. Didn’t know what it meant. But he knew this:



It didn’t matter.



She was his now. His littlelady. And he was her Pawpaw.



Old bones, sure. Scarred hands. A heart patched together with duct tape and stubbornness. But he was skilled. He’d flown through hell and come out humming. He’d buried the dead, lit the stars, and taught a child to say Birdie.



He stood, cracked his neck, and whispered to the empty shuttle:



“You can come for her. You can come for me. But you better bring more than fire.”



He walked back to the Wren, boots echoing in the corridor. The ship felt warmer now. Like home.



She stirred as he entered, blinking up at him.



“Pawpaw?”



He smiled. That same quiet, breaking smile.



“I’m here, littlelady. Always.”

🌌 Chapter Six: The Search Begins

Eight months after the signal—long after Elias shut it down, long after he stopped wondering who might’ve heard it—a fleet emerges from the edge of known space.



Fifty ships. Sleek, angular, humming with power. Their hulls shimmer with refractive plating, their weapons systems hot but idle. They don’t fire. They don’t hail. They scan.



They are looking.



For a shuttle. For a signal. For a child.



For a princess.



🛠️ Meanwhile, A Sector Away

The Wren drifts through a quiet trade lane, eight months and a dozen jumps removed from the crash site. Elias and the girl—Sela, though he still calls her littlelady—have settled into a rhythm that feels like home.



She’s grown. Not much in size, but in spirit. She speaks more now. Draws pictures of stars and birds and a man with a beard who fixes things. She hums when she works. She calls him Pawpaw with a confidence that breaks him every time.



They have no idea.



Humanity doesn’t know either. The signal was brief, buried in static. No one traced it. No one flagged it. The Brex haven’t heard. The colonies haven’t seen. The Wren is just another dot on a long, quiet map.



But the fleet is moving.



📡 Fleet Transmission – Internal Log

“We have traced the signal to this sector. Shuttle ID matches royal escape protocols. No confirmed survivors.”



“The child may still live. If so, she is heir to the throne. We must recover her. We must know what happened.”



“Prepare diplomatic protocols. Prepare military contingencies. Prepare for anything.”





🚨 Chapter Seven: The Standoff at Virex Drift

The Virex Drift was supposed to be quiet. A neutral zone. A place for refueling, minor trade, and watching the stars spin.



But on this day, it becomes the eye of a storm.



Humanity’s 5th Expeditionary Fleet, fresh from patrol routes near the Brex border, drops out of FTL to investigate anomalous readings—gravitic distortions, faint signal echoes, and a strange energy signature that doesn’t match any known tech.



They find fifty alien ships already there.



Angular. Silent. Armed.



The alien fleet doesn’t respond to hails. Doesn’t move. Doesn’t retreat. They scan. They wait.



Humanity’s fleet forms up. Shields raised. Weapons hot. No one fires.



For six hours, the two fleets drift in silence, locked in a ballet of tension. Fighters scramble. Commanders bark orders. Diplomats scramble for translation protocols. The Drift’s comms hub overloads with encrypted chatter.



Then—a breakthrough.



📡 Intercepted Transmission – Alien Fleet

“...child may be aboard a civilian vessel. Signal fragment matches royal escape beacon. We must locate her.”



“If humans have her, we must speak. If not, we must search. She is not a threat. She is our hope.”



🧠 Human Fleet Intelligence Briefing

“They’re not here to fight. They’re searching for someone. A child. Possibly a survivor from a crash eight months ago.”



“We cross-referenced the signal. It matches a brief anomaly logged by a freighter called The Wren. No known registry. No recent sightings.”



“We may have passed her. We may have missed her. We need to talk.”



🤝 The Moment of Realization

A human diplomat—Commander Riva—steps onto a neutral shuttle and crosses the void. She meets the alien envoy aboard a shimmering cruiser named The Solace of Kin. They speak. They share data. They compare fragments.



And slowly, the tension bleeds away.



This isn’t a war. It’s a search.



For a girl.



For a princess.



For a myth reborn.



🌠 Chapter Nine: The Relay at Kestrel’s Hollow

They were three months deeper into the fringe now. Past the mapped lanes. Past the trade routes. The Wren had become a ghost ship in a quiet sea, drifting between dust clouds and forgotten moons.



Elias liked it that way.



Sela had grown bolder—climbing into maintenance ducts, sketching constellations on the bulkhead, asking questions about gravity and music and why some stars blinked and others didn’t. She was thriving. And Elias, for all his gruffness, had started to believe they might outrun the past.



Then they found the relay.



It was old. Half-buried in the crust of a dead moon. A Kestrel-class comms node, long abandoned but still humming faintly with power. Elias patched in, mostly out of habit.



And the signal came through.



📡 GalNet Bulletin – Priority Transmission

“To all vessels: The 5th Expeditionary Fleet has confirmed the existence of a royal escapee from the Arakari system. The child is believed to be aboard a civilian freighter, possibly unregistered. Humanity has pledged full cooperation in the search.”



“If you encounter a vessel matching the Wren’s profile, do not engage. Report immediately. The child is not a threat. She is a bridge.”



“We seek peace. We seek truth. We seek her.”



🧠 Elias Reads the Message

He stood there for a long time, the words flickering on the cracked relay screen. The Wren’s profile. The child. A bridge.



He didn’t move. Didn’t speak.



Sela was in the engine room, humming to herself, drawing birds on the coolant tanks.



Elias ran a hand over his beard, stared at the stars beyond the viewport, and whispered:



“They’re not just looking for her. They’re hoping she’s the answer.”



🤔 His Thoughts, Unspoken

If I keep running, I protect her. But I deny her the truth.



If I turn back, I risk everything. But maybe… maybe she belongs to more than just me.



She’s not just a passenger anymore. She’s the center of something mythic.



🌌 Scene: The Wren’s Bridge, Late Evening

The stars outside are slow and golden, drifting past the viewport like embers in a dying fire. Elias stands at the console, the relay message still flickering on the screen. Sela sits nearby, legs crossed, sketching a bird with wings made of constellations.



He clears his throat.



“Littlelady… I need to tell you something.”



She looks up. Her eyes are calm, curious.



“Your people—they’re looking for you. Not just a few. A whole fleet. Fifty ships. And now humanity’s joined them. They’re searching the stars for a girl who vanished. A girl who might be… you.”



Sela blinks. Her pencil stills.



“Me?”



Elias nods slowly.



“I didn’t know at first. I didn’t want to know. I just saw a scared kid in a busted shuttle and figured I’d keep her safe. But now… now the whole damn galaxy’s listening. And I think it’s time we spoke.”



He kneels beside her, voice low.



“I need your help to call them. Not just to tell them you’re alive—but to tell them who you are. If you want to. If you’re ready.”



She’s quiet for a long time. Then she reaches out and touches the console.



“Will they be kind?”



Elias swallows hard.



“I don’t know. But I’ll be right here. Every step.”



📡 Universal Broadcast: Unintended Transmission from The Wren

\[BEGIN TRANSMISSION\]



Visual: A worn command chair. Elias Calder, grizzled and squinting, sits with a small girl curled on his lap. She’s clutching a sketchpad and blinking sleepily. The stars drift behind them like slow fireflies.



Elias (scratching his beard):



“Uh… hey y’all. Might’ve hit the wrong button here. Looks like we’re causin’ a bit of a fuss out there. Sorry ‘bout that.”



He glances down at the girl, who’s now tugging his sleeve.



“We’re headin’ y’all’s way soon. Thought maybe it’s time you met the littlelady. Go ahead, sweetheart—say hello.”



Sela (softly, smiling):



“Hi. I’m Sela. I’m okay. Pawpaw fixed my ship and taught me how to make toast with a plasma coil. We saw a comet and he let me name it. It’s called Birdie.”



“We live on the Wren now. It’s cozy. I have a blanket with stars on it. Pawpaw reads me stories. He’s the best fixer in the galaxy.”



“I think I used to be someone important. But now I’m just me. And I’m happy.”



She yawns, curls tighter against him.



Elias (chuckling):



“Alright, that’s enough excitement for one night. She’s driftin’ off.”



He leans forward, voice low and warm.



“Okay y’all, I gotta get her tucked in. When she wakes up, we’ll head back fast as we can toward Earth. But Birdie don’t like flyin’ when my littlelady’s nappin.”



“So this is Pawpaw… peace.”



\[END TRANSMISSION\]



🌌 Galactic Reaction: Silence, Then a Roar

Across fleets, stations, and colonies, the message plays. No encryption. No protocol. Just raw truth.



Commanders pause. Civilians cry. The alien fleet replays it twice.



And somewhere deep in the diplomatic core, someone whispers:



“We’re not chasing a fugitive. We’re welcoming a family.”



🌍 Humanity’s Reaction

🛡️ 5th Expeditionary Fleet – Admiral Vance’s Bridge

The admiral watches the transmission in silence. His officers glance at him, waiting for orders. He finally speaks:



“Stand down. All ships. That’s not a fugitive. That’s a family. We escort them home.”



The fleet shifts formation—not to intercept, but to welcome. Fighters peel off to clear lanes. Comms officers begin broadcasting a new signal:



“To the Wren: You are not alone. We await your return.”



🏙️ Earth – Civilian Response

Newsfeeds explode with the clip. “Pawpaw and the Princess” becomes a trending phrase.



Children draw Birdie, the comet. Artists sketch Sela’s star blanket. Musicians remix her sleepy voice into lullabies.



A movement begins: “Let her choose.” People want peace. They want unity. They want her story to be hers.



🛸 Alien Fleet Reaction – Arakari High Command

🧬 Council Chamber, Arakari Prime

The elders watch the broadcast. One weeps silently. Another whispers:



“She remembers. She calls him Pawpaw. She is safe.”



They issue a new directive: “No weapons. No demands. Only welcome.”



The fleet begins crafting a ceremonial escort. Ships repaint their hulls with royal insignias. A new anthem is composed—half in Arakari tongue, half in human harmony.



🛰️ Neutral Zones and Fringe Worlds

Pirate crews pause mid-raid to watch the clip. One grizzled captain mutters, “That old man’s got guts.”



Fringe traders begin tagging their ships with “Birdie-friendly” decals, signaling safe passage.



A relay station on the edge of Brex space replays the message hourly. Locals gather to listen, like it’s a bedtime story.



🕊️ Diplomatic Core – Joint Human-Arakari Council

They draft a new protocol: The Wren Accord.



“Any vessel carrying Sela Calder shall be granted safe passage, full protection, and diplomatic immunity. She is not a symbol of war. She is a symbol of peace.”



🎙️ Final Note: The Galaxy Waits

Across the stars, ships slow. Messages pour in. Some offer help. Some offer songs. Some simply say:



“We heard you, Pawpaw. We’re ready.”



🎥 Raw Footage – The Wren, Galley Deck

The footage begins mid-motion. No title card. No music. Just the soft hum of the Wren’s systems and the shuffle of boots on metal.



The shuttle doors had opened an hour ago. No greeting party. No armed escort. Just a quiet “no” from Elias Calder when the diplomats tried to step forward first.



“She sees her kind first. That’s the rule.”



And so she did.



Sela had run—not walked—into the arms of her people. Not all were kin by blood, but they were kin by memory. By the same stars. By the same scars. She showed them everything: her drawings, her bunk, the scorch mark she called “Birdie’s birthmark.” She pointed to the galley and whispered, “That’s where Pawpaw makes the good stuff.”



The reporters followed, cameras rolling, but no one spoke. No narration. No commentary. Just the sound of Sela’s voice, high and bright, echoing through the freighter like sunlight in a cave.



🍻 Later – Galley Table, Wren

The footage cuts to a wide shot: a worn wooden table, clearly handmade. The grain is uneven. One leg has a bolt through it. Around it sit six guests—three humans, three Arakari—each with a mug of homemade ale.



Sela is curled under a faded blanket on the couch bolted to the wall. Her sketchpad rests on her chest, one hand still clutching a crayon. She’s asleep.



Elias Calder sits at the head of the table. He doesn’t speak. Doesn’t toast. Just waits.



The silence stretches. Not awkward. Not tense. Just real.



Finally, one of the Arakari envoys—an elder with silver skin and a voice like wind through reeds—leans forward.



“She is safe here.”



A human reporter nods.



“She’s home here.”



Elias lifts his mug, takes a sip, and sets it down.



“Then we can talk.”



🕊️ Broadcast Notes – Unedited Transmission

No cuts. No overlays. Just raw footage streamed across both networks.



Viewership spikes within minutes. Comments flood in: “This feels real.” “I cried when she showed the couch.” “That table looks like my granddad’s.”



Diplomatic channels stall. Not because of conflict—but because no one wants to interrupt the moment.



🎙️ Universal Broadcast – The Wren, Galley Deck

The camera’s still rolling. No edits. No cuts. Just the low hum of the freighter and the clink of mugs on wood.



Elias Calder leans forward, elbows on the table, eyes steady. Sela sleeps behind him, curled under a blanket, her breath slow and even.



He sighs. Then speaks.



“I’m not stupid. I know she needs her people. And her people need her.”



“But I wanna speak to everyone here—and out there.”



“As a human, I found her. No question. I was gonna save her. It’s the right thing to do.”



“Now I’m PawPaw to her. And I know where she needs to be.”



He pauses, voice thick with truth.



“I don’t like it. I’m willing to start an interstellar incident to keep her safe.”



“So I’ve given this thought. Whatever agreement y’all make—that’s fine. That’s between the peoples. Diplomats can deal.”



“But I’m PawPaw. And PawPaw isn’t leaving her.”



“So I’m gonna follow them across the void. If they like it or not.”



“If they do—I’ll be PawPaw beside her ‘til my end.”



“If not—me and Birdie’ll be overwatch ‘til my end.”



He lifts his mug, not in toast, but in testament.



“I’m not rejecting humanity by leaving. I’m embracing it.”



📡 Fleetwide Reaction: Silence, Then Reverence

Human diplomats lower their heads. One whispers, “That’s what we’re supposed to be.”



Arakari elders mark the moment with a gesture of kinship—two fingers to the heart, then to the stars.



Viewers across systems replay the speech. Parents quote it to their children. Soldiers etch it into their armor.



🕊️ Legacy Begins

This isn’t just a speech. It’s a vow. A myth. A new kind of diplomacy—one built not on treaties, but on devotion.



🌌 Scene: After the Broadcast

Elias finishes speaking. The words hang in the air like smoke from a campfire—rough, warm, unforgettable.



Before anyone can respond, Sela stirs on the couch. She blinks, sees him at the table, and bolts across the galley.



She throws her arms around him, burying her face in his chest.



“Pawpaw…”



He wraps her up, one hand cradling her head, the other steady on her back. No cameras needed. No commentary. Just a hug that says I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere.



🛠️ The Wren Reborn

The Wren was never meant to cross into Andromeda. Her jump core was outdated. Her hull was rated for local drift, not intergalactic burn. But none of that mattered.



She was Sela’s home. And Pawpaw had made a promise.



So humanity and the Arakari came together—engineers, physicists, shipwrights, dreamers. They drydocked the Wren in orbit over Luna, stripped her down to the bones, and rebuilt her for the journey ahead.



Human tech: Reinforced hull plating, quantum nav systems, gravitic shielding.



Arakari tech: Bio-reactive life support, harmonic stabilizers, memory-threaded AI.



But through it all, one thing never changed: Sela’s bed stayed exactly where it was.



The couch in the galley. The blanket with stars. The sketchpad tucked in the corner. No matter the upgrades, the soul stayed the same.



And to everyone’s quiet pride, Sela never spent a single night away from it.



🛸 The Arakari Finally Speak

After Elias’s broadcast, after the hug, after the silence—one of the Arakari elders steps forward. Their voice is soft, melodic, resonant.



“You speak not as a soldier. Not as a diplomat. But as a father. We have no word for Pawpaw. But we will learn it.”



“You are welcome among us. Not as guardian. Not as guest. But as kin.”



Elias nods, eyes misty but steady.



“Then let’s fly.”



🕊️ Final Shot

The Wren, reborn, launches from drydock. Her hull gleams with new alloys, her engines hum with alien harmony. But inside, the galley still smells like old wood and homemade ale.



Sela sleeps on her couch. Elias sits nearby, boots up, watching the stars blur past.



And somewhere in the void, a new myth begins:



“She crossed galaxies in a ship built of love. And Pawpaw never left her side.”



🚀 One Shot: 1500 Years Later

The year is 3525. Humanity has long since left Earth behind, scattering across stars like seeds in the wind. But today, they gather—on the orbital ring of New Sol, beneath the twin moons of the Terran Archive—to witness something sacred.



Two ships stand ready in the drydock, gleaming under the light of a blue giant star.



The Pawpaw: A deep-range colony vessel, rugged and resolute. Its hull bears the scars of simulated meteor storms, a tribute to the freighter that once defied the void.



The Sela: A diplomatic ark, graceful and radiant. Its interior is designed around a central galley with a couch—replicated exactly from historical scans.



They are not warships. They are not scouts. They are symbols.



📜 The Ceremony

A voice echoes across the ring—ancient, synthesized from Elias Calder’s final broadcast.



“She crossed galaxies in a ship built of love. And Pawpaw never left her side.”



The crowd is silent. Then, from the observation deck, a child steps forward. She places a sketchpad on the console. It’s a drawing of a bird—half freighter, half phoenix.



The launch director nods.



“By order of the Terran Council, and in honor of the myth that made us whole… we launch the Pawpaw and the Sela. May they carry our soul into the stars.”



🌠 Final Shot

The ships ignite their drives. Twin trails of light spiral outward, weaving like ribbons through the dark.



As they vanish into the deep, the Archive plays a final log:



“This is Elias Calder. If you’re hearing this, it means we made it. Not just across the stars—but through the silence. Through the fear. Through the loss.”



“We made it because we stayed together. Because one little girl never spent a night without her bed. And because one old man never stopped flying.”

* Examples of His Collab Style:
   * Past/Teased Projects: He's done informal collabs with local Oregon artists, like layering vocals over beats for free mixtapes. One standout was a track with a fellow indie rapper on homelessness awareness—super heartfelt and community-driven.
   * Current Calls: He's posting things like ""Who's down to collab on a beat drop that slaps harder than my coffee addiction? Tag your producers! #MusicCollab #ClowbrandedVibes"". If you're a musician, hit him up—he's responsive and all about mutual growth.

How to Get Involved

* Reach Out: Slide into his Twitter/X DMs (@clowbranded) or check his SoundCloud for open collab invites. He's mentioned using tools like Splice for sample sharing.
* Why Collab with Him?: Low-pressure, high-creativity. Plus, he's got that underdog story—your input could help amplify his (and your) voice on bigger platforms. He's even tying it to causes, like donating proceeds from collab tracks to anti-homelessness orgs.
* Pro Tip: If you're into Rihanna-level pop with a twist, or crypto-fueled electronic stuff, align your pitch there. He's all about positive energy and ""vibing"" together.

If you've got a specific angle (like genre or a track idea), I can brainstorm more tailored suggestions. What's your music style—wanna collab on a hypothetical with C-LoW?",1,1755951235.0,u_EMP444,0,1.0,False

1mxztqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1mxztqo/super_wet_puck/,Super wet puck,"hi, looking for any help,

 I did check past wet puck experiences but mine seems a little different, the portafilter does not come out filled with water after back-flushing, only shots with a puck of coffee. 

I am using a Caedo e5p, and was using a breville duo temp, everything was great until breville shit the bed, but very dry pucks, like just steaming no liquid. 

 I picked up a Gaggia classic 03', and I have not had one dry puck since, so it isn't the grinder. Everything is dialed in to a basic level (18g basket, 18.5g full city, 36g out, 30 sec) and I end up with a puck covered in standing water , not just soupy or wet. its weird because the solenoid does remove some water into the tray, but its like a 1/3 of the amount when backlashing and doesn't really do anything besides the cool whoosh noise. 

I don't think the solenoid being clogged is the issue, because when backlashing the solenoid works great, it shoots a good amount of water into tray, and the protafilter drier than my puck of coffee after a shot.  ive also tried alternating steam and brew trick to see if that does anything.

 Also my flow is completely fine out of the group head, no issues there. 

  
any suggestions? 

(also I understand wet pucks don't effect the quality of a shot, but it is a big inconvenience to dump a soupy puck as it is messy and gets everywhere when hitting, and my knock box collects mold after a day if they are that wet)",2,1755951193.0,gaggiaclassic,2,1.0,False
