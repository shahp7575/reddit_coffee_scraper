I've been dealing with essential tremor for years and got tired of trying to remember how bad my tremors were at my last appointment or what triggers I noticed. So I built an app called SteadyMate to help track everything.

The app is completely free to use. Here's what it does:

Quick tremor logging - I can log my tremor severity throughout the day with optional notes. No more trying to remember how I felt last week.

Steady Hold test - This is a test where you hold your phone still for 30 seconds and it measures how much you shake. The app uses your phone's motion sensors to track your steadiness over time. I use this to see if my meds are actually working or if my tremor is getting worse. It gives me actual numbers instead of just guessing.

Trigger and medication tracking - I log what makes my tremors worse and what meds I'm taking. The app has algorithms that analyze all this data to spot patterns I might have missed. Like maybe my tremors are always worse on Tuesdays after I have coffee, or they get better when I take my meds at a certain time. It's not AI, just smart pattern recognition that helps me understand what actually affects my tremor.

Calm breathing sessions - When my tremors get bad from stress or anxiety, there's a breathing exercise tool that helps me calm down. You can add journal notes after if you want.

PDF reports for appointments - This is the big one for me. I can export everything as a PDF to bring to my neurologist. No more trying to explain what happened over the past few months. They can see the actual data and patterns.

Reminders - You can set reminders to log your tremors, but it respects quiet hours so it won't bug you at night.

There's an optional premium subscription if you want deeper insights and extended history, but all the core features are free. The app uses iCloud to sync across your devices so everything stays private and secure.

I built this because I needed it myself, and I'm sharing it in case it helps anyone else here. You can find it on the App Store:

[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steadymate/id6757168811](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steadymate/id6757168811)

1q5wujy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeanDrop/comments/1q5wujy/taking_eoi_for_next_drop_aussie_champs/,Taking EOI for next drop - Aussie champs,"Hi everyone starting to gather interest for the next Aussie roaster drop, which is going to feature coffees from some local champs.

A reminder, I'm doing this for fun not profit but need to make sure I'm not out of pocket doing this as it already involves a bit of time and effort. Not a coffee professional or expert by any means, just trying to share coffees that I would like to have myself and hopefully building up a bit of a coffee community along the way sharing brews and ideas. 

I'm still getting a gauge of what price point and level of distinction of coffees the group is after, and I'm hoping I'm striking the right balance between value and 'fanciness' for the lack of a better word. Let me know your thoughts. 

Splitting a single 200-250g bag only goes 4-5 ways so there's not much to go around but if there's enough interest through this expression of interest (EOI) I could look at going a step up and offering 8-10 packs instead, or more, you get the idea. If we ever got to 20 or so people interested per drop then we're cooking and economies of scale and 1kg bulk buying power really kick in. 

Enough from me, my proposal for the next drop full of Aussie goodness are coffees from:

Blackboard Coffee Roasters’ Co-owner and MD Danny Andrade has been named winner of the 2026 Australian Coffee Roasters Championship. 

Gab Tan has been crowned the 2026 Australian Barista Champion and runs Newav coffee as a project. 

Sample coffee menu below, pending what's available at the time of order. 5x50g bags including shipping for $43. 

Yes it's pricey but think of what you'll pay buying one expensive bag of coffee from a reputable roaster and paying for shipping. With this drop you get lots more value and variety! Aiming for mid Jan purchase for brewing in Feb.

Colombia Sudan Rume Honey Playa Bonita
Brazil Vinhal Farm Anaerobic Natural Thermal Shock
Ethiopia Bekeka Gogogu Washed

We’re all high school seniors and my friends have been talking about going to new york for a day trip over break.  I said we should take the train there cuz I think it’s easier than taking a bus and I don’t have to drive.  My one friend said they’re cool with it, my other friend kept wanting to take the bus.  They also said that I should drive us to New Jersey first so we can take the bus.  I said I don’t think I want to drive my car that far, and they said that my other friend and I would just go without them.  I was like 🧐 and told them we should all just go together from the train station directly to NY.  They said “then we’ll (them and the other friend) have to pay more.”Looking at the prices, the tickets cost 12 bucks.  But my friend doesn’t have an issue splurging on things like merch, snacks, coffees, and MY GAS.  

I have an issue with what they said because I usually take them home (they live about 30 minutes away, my other friend lives 30 minutes away in the completely opposite direction), drive them around, pay, etc.  I stopped driving them so much because I can’t be spending 30+ dollars a week on gas.  They don’t want to buy a ticket for a trip they’ve been mentioning for months which would save money, but have no issue with me driving a couple hours into different states and spending more on gas.

Hey there. I’m a 32 year old guy from Michigan who’s definitely more on the introverted side, but once I’m comfortable I’m pretty laid back and sarcastic. I’m better one on one than in big groups and I prefer real conversations over small talk.

I work a job with weird hours, so my schedule is a little all over the place, but that also means I’m around to chat at random times. In the warmer months I love being outdoors hiking, kayaking, camping, anything like that. In winter I’m more of a homebody. Reading, binging shows, good coffee, and quiet nights are my thing.

I’m not looking for anything intense or forced. Just chill conversation, getting to know someone, sharing thoughts, laughs, random topics, or even comfortable silence. Friends are great, and if it turns into a longer term chat connection, even better.

I've been suffering from some form of IBS since being a teenager. But a stable routine and coffee helped me manage it effectively until Covid.

It's rarely gasy and doesn't smell.

But my butthole feels ""weird"" a lot of the time. Like its a muscle that constantly clenching.

It's weird in that it's a very different IBS compared to what I used to have.

I also occasionally have very ""acidic"" bowel movements that burn the butthole like I ate chilly peppers the previous night.

I took occasional Cholestyramine against the acidic bowel movements and they help with the acid. But the frequency is still annoying to deal with.

When it’s working: I feel calm, productive, and emotionally regulated. The constant worry and overwhelm just become background noise. I can attentively listen and absorb information. My personality shines through because I can FINALLY keep up with people and follow conversations. 

The problem: It doesn’t matter if I avoid coffee or vitamin c in the morning, eat before, or even sleep well. I still crash at work, typically 3 hours in. 

To prevent this, I started to take an XR booster essentially about 1 hour before the crash and it really helps. 

I only work 4 hours, but it seems to greatly help me. 

Here’s my pattern: 

\- Take 30 mg of XR at 8:30 am

\- Arrive at work for 10:00 am

\- It’ll really kick in and start working by 10:30 am

\- Take my XR booster in water at noon

\- Feel functionally the best from 12:30-2 pm. 

\- Usually crash at 3 pm, instead of at work. 

So with an XR booster, I get 4.5 hours before I crash. Although, I only feel truly functional for about 4 hours.

Today I’m 60 days alcohol sober - coincidentally also my son’s 10th birthday which was great to have a clean family dinner where he was the well/ deserved focus of attention.

After my second Afib episode in early November and having to spend two days in ICU in the most horrible hospital in Egypt while on holiday, I figured I had had enough.

I work in an industry (travel) where most of the business and networking is done late at night over too many drinks. Long story short, too many long haul flights, too many late nights, way too many drinks, too many 14+ hours work days, too much junk food, too much coffee to compensate, too much overweight.

A few days ago I went to my local taproom, where I was their celebrated number 1 client based on Untappd. Managed to control myself with one AF IPA and since then I realized that maybe I’ve put it behind me. This is all new to me and still soaking it in - I haven’t not had alcohol for more than 3 days since I was probably 18 (now 42).

Yet no, it is a 1960s hard bop release from trombonist Julian Priester. Most  of you probably know Julian from his stints on Herbie Hancock's sextet and fusion work. Julian did have two releases during the 60s on the Riverside label. This track here is a fantastic example of solo trombone playing in a quartet setting. In fact I would recommend this track for younger musicians looking to transcribe and learn a good bebop/hard bop trombone solo. Check it out when you get a chance.

1q5w5b0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q5w5b0,Am I really causing this smell?,"My roommate and I just moved in together in the middle of November so it’s been almost two months. She moved in first and I started bringing my things a couple days after. She did bring up before moving in together that she is very particular about cleanliness and how things are cleaned and while my standard is not nearly as high, I fully thought I could maintain her expectations at the very least in the common areas of course.

I don’t socialize often so after we first moved in, I was really focused on unpacking everything and stayed in my room for the most part. After my couch and tv got delivered late November and set up in the living room I started hanging out more in the common area like once a day for an hour or two. While I could feel tension, I really had no idea about there was any problem. She actually bought me air purifier bags, cups full of coffee beans and even moisture absorbers, but I really just thought that was just her being her since she has a high standard for cleanliness and a strong sense of smell while mine isn’t very strong, she had actually asked me to get a specific kind of air purifier (large trio plus $150 Costco) before we moved in together. It wasn’t until dec 16 that she told me about about a smell in the apartment. We talked on the couch and she told me it was a strong smell that was like the cat odor and had other scents, but I was way too embarrassed and didn’t want to know what it smelled like, but she’s gets more descriptive in her texts I’ve attached. 
After she told me I spent the next couple days washing all my clothes with vinegar and hot water (she didn’t want any scented or unnatural products used in the apartment or washer) I normally do my laundry while watching tv but she had asked me not to so the smell doesn’t get into the couch or rug. We have an open floor plan so it’s kitchen and living room are right next to each and the washer is next to the kitchen so the first day I sat at our counter while working from home and had brought some laundry baskets out so I could wash a whole bunch while working. I hadn’t put anything in the living room, but I guess the smell got all over the place anyway. By the time my roommate got home from work, I had moved everything into my room so I could start folding and organizing, but I could hear her spray everything down with hypochlorous acid when she got home and I felt so bad. After that, I made sure to only bring my laundry out to put it in the washer or bring it back to my room. I washed my entire closet and anything I couldn’t wash I sprayed with hypochlorous acid (her request). I also cleaned most my furniture again and I’m still in the process of cleaning my shoes and purses, but the ones that haven’t been fully cleaned have been sprayed down multiple times. I’ve also put a couple bowls of distilled white vinegar around my space since I heard it pulls smells out. I keep the air purifier on max all the time with my window open and keep my doors shut. I haven’t been going in the common areas unless absolutely necessary since I had brought my laundry out so hopefully I wasn’t bringing the smell out. I had actually gone through and cleaned a lot of my stuff before moving in since I knew cleanliness is really important to her. At this point I’ve cleaned everything I’ve brought into the apartment. 

I had been really stressing about this and trying to get rid of this smell and I can’t even smell it. So I spent a few days at my parents house for the holidays. They live an hour away, but with it being December and all the Christmas things happening I’ve spent a couple weekends over there this month. Well, I was there. I had my mom and sister’s smell the clothes that I brought along with my old room from before I moved to the apartment and they couldn’t smell anything bad. On my last day there she was sending me videos and tips on cleaning (I’ve watched and followed them) and also some different laundry detergents since the washes I’ve done so far hadn’t helped so I ordered them on Amazon and washed a blanket and laid it out on the dryer for her to test but she never let me know how it smelled. The only suggestion I said no too was the ozone machine bc of the risks. I have gotten more of the air purifiering baggies and moisture absorbers since they’re disposable and I got us more hypochlorous acid. 

I’ve also taken a bunch of different things (washed and unwashed) to work and was going to ask just one friend if they smelled, but a bunch of my coworkers were intrigued so they smelled them too. Other than one sweater that smelled like a box (it had been in storage) and my work out shoes smelling like work out shoes when they smelled the inside, nobody smelled anything bad. 

Since Ive cleaned literally everything at this point (haven’t double washed my clothes with the new detergent since she didn’t lmk how it smelled) I had my mom come over on Sunday and she smelled the whole place, and couldn’t find any negative odors or anything that could be causing this. My roommate didn’t believe this when I told her so even though she’s said not to bring in the complex, I came home early from work yesterday and talked to them and they had someone come out and check the unit. They also didn’t find any negative odors and I did have them check the common areas my room and bathroom and closet and they found nothing. They did say that unused HVAC systems can cause smells like the ones she’s describing so he put a cleaner in it and ran it. I took a video of the interaction and also had the apartment complex send me a summary, but I haven’t shared these yet with her. 

I know she’s still smelling the smell because she’s still lighting her incense constantly and I can hear her spraying hypochlorous acid regularly. She’s also been using the air sanitizer, although improperly. 

I haven’t felt comfortable being in the common areas for weeks now because she would just spray right after I left and it felt filled with tension so I actually haven’t seen her in about a week and a half. 

I’ve also included our text conversations since it started for more context. 

At this point I just feel so uncomfortable here and can’t imagine staying in this situation for another year. When I talked to the complex, they did give me some options, but we just moved in so they’re kind of limited. If we terminate the lease we’re responsible for the full lease amount. Once we’ve been here for six months, we can do a transfer so one of us could go to a one bedroom while the other one gets removed from the lease. Our only options before the six month period is for one of us to get removed from the lease, but since it’s a two bedroom and neither one of us can afford it on our own so whoever would stay would need to have a guarantor sign on. The thing is though is that I’m 50 minutes from my work and an hour away from my family. I moved to this location specifically because she wanted to live here. She also has family just five minutes away and work is only like 10 minutes away. So if we had to do this, then I’d really like to be the one who left. 

But I feel so lost and I’m not sure if I really am the problem or if leaving is the right solution. I’d really appreciate any helpful comments you can provide.

I used to disturb the bed too much with 4:6 method. Also too wide of a pouring circle. 

Here's my last recipe of the result of so many fine tuning:

1- 20gr to 300gr - 16 clicks with Timemore C3

2- 50gr bloom for 45 sec and a gentle swirl

3- pour to 170gr at slow rate, low and gentle pours. Circles little wider than a grape.

4- pour to 300, faster and wider than previous.

WHY?

1- a good balance between a strong body, sweetness and harshness.

2- shorter blooms resulted in sour cups

3- Lets you get a sweeter cup and a good extraction without channeling and disturbing the bed.

4- Faster because i've experienced too much bitterness with slower pours. Found a middle ground here.

1q5w1gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonCrawlerCarl/comments/1q5w1gf/my_dcc_journey_a_writeup/,My DCC journey - a write-up,"*System message: This text contains spoilers for book three ... and maybe beyond. Proceed with caution. Or don't. I'm not your real dad. Yet.*

“I’ve recently started listening to audiobooks,” I said, holding my beer in one hand while gesturing wildly with my other. “It’s great! I now understand why you enjoy them so much. Recently I finished a Star Trek audiobook. The narrator did a really good job with the voices.”

It was already late; the darkness of the October sky was contrasted by the colorful leafes in front of the building, streetlights illuminating them in a warm, cozy glow. We were at my friend Norman’s birthday party - he was turning 44 tonight. Damn, time flies. I’ve known this guy for the better part of 20 years now. 20 fucking years. How can it be this long when we still felt like those 20-something guys in college?

Norman grinned. “Is that so? Wait, let me check it out.” He took his phone out of his back pocket and looked for the one I was telling him about, aaaand added it to my pile. “Thanks! By the way, if you really want to have fun with a book, check out Dungeon Crawler Carl. Brilliant and immersive; though you can tell that the narrator needed to settle in during the first one. By the second he managed it, and by the third… oh man… you can tell the author was writing for that guy. Lots and lots of video game references, too. Think Running Man meets Big Brother meets バトル・ロワイアル.”

I had no idea why Norman tried to be edgy by throwing in some Japanese characters, but I didn’t care. It sounded intriguing.

Sandra, Norman’s wife, overheard us speaking over the sound of some random disco song I didn’t recognize and approached. “Is that the one with the stupid-as-hell story you showed me that one time? The one with… hmm… can’t remember. It was weird.”

Norman looked apologetic. “No, different one.”

“Sounds fun,” I said, ignoring Sandra and getting my own phone out. “Is it on Spotify?”

“I’m afraid not. Audible.”

Another service I would have to pay for. Ugh. Well. I was going to think about it, but I always trusted Norman’s recommendations. Over the years he became a person I immensely respected. If he liked the book, I may as well try it.

Three days later I finally managed to sit down and start my journey. It was late in the evening. I booted up one of those video games where you can listen to stuff while you’re doing other shit in the game. In my case, this was Elite Dangerous. Flying a ship through some unknown part of the galaxy while scanning planets and landing on some to do science was the perfect pastime after a stressful day at work. Why not supplement it with a new book?

I even sent Norman a quick photo of me sitting at my computer with the player open. “Starting it today.” He responded with a thumbs-up.

*The first one is free*, they always say. *Be careful, or you’ll get sucked in. You become addicted.* 

I didn’t know any better. The free credit from Audible after signing up was for the first book. I would get a second one next month. Rinse and repeat. Easy. A book a month is more than enough. It took me roughly six weeks for the last one with a similar runtime on Spotify. This is manageable. I planned it all out. I was confident. 

And I failed completely.

Jeff Hays’ sweet, buttery voice was already touching me in places I would never allow anyone else. If the first book was this great already, how mind-bogglingly great would the next one be? I am not a patient person.

I bought three additional credits and got the next three volumes.

Perfect timing, too - I was going on multiple business trips and had some time on my hands sitting in hotels in the evening. I listened to them on planes, on trains, during tasteless hotel breakfasts where not even the coffee can save your mornings. It was like a river inside me that grew more restless the more I listened. The occasional very late nights were owed to the adventures of my two favorite crawlers. 

As I started to dive deeper into this world and the narrative, my perception of what I was promised and what I was now deeply immersed in, changed radically. This went beyond video games and beyond a funny little AI that enjoys feet. 

I vividly remember one night when I was lying in bed in some city while attending a trade show. The long hours - standing at a booth, having a mix of more or less intelligent conversations with would-be customers, suppliers, and some dude who only wanted a free pen - had taken their toll. I just wanted to sleep. But I had grown accustomed to my thirty-minute dose of dungeon madness before sleep took me over. On this fateful night my perception of the series shifted yet again.

Several things happened at once.

I was on book three, *The Dungeon Anarchist’s Cookbook*. As I drifted into a blissful state of relaxation, the app’s timer ticking away in the background, I tried imagining the mess of train lines and colors, and how one might navigate them. My brain was occupied with the complicated array our heroes were trapped in, while slowly but surely letting my exhaustion take over. Up until that point, I had trouble with this floor. The endless tunnels and lack of a more diverse landscape were a stark contrast to the Over City. I wasn’t a fan, but I appreciated the change in pace anyway.

Then I was suddenly jolted awake.

Did this really just happen?!

Katia just killed Hekla.

WHAT. THE. HELL?!

Mayhem ensued. Guts were flying. The train was torn asunder. The AI cheating? Yep, I kissed my sleep goodbye. I deleted the timer and listened until 3 a.m. In retrospect, this may have been a mistake, given that I was expected to be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed in five hours - but wow. Screw work. They just killed motherfucking Hekla! Best. Book. Ever!

I couldn’t stop now. And I didn’t. Not even by a long shot.

Merch was ordered. I was spreading the gospel of the Princess Posse. I even formed a crawler-themed squadron - basically a clan - in Elite Dangerous. And of course the audiobook minutes ticked by like the unforgiving safe room screen showing the number of the remaining crawlers.

Which brings me to today.

Book seven is done. I am done.

So much has happened. Three months ago I started this journey, and now I have to wait until May for the next book. Fuck me! A part of me wishes I’d been told about DCC - as the cool kids apparently say - in a couple of years, when the series had concluded. But actually I’m happy I got to experience this now, together with the community.

It became something far bigger than what I expected when I was first told about a book full of video game references. I never imagined it would turn into the journey of a man and his cat trying to survive the apocalypse and topple a galactic government in the process. A story about introspection, identity, and what it means to exist in a world so strange it may as well be a video game.

So thank you, Norman, for opening up this world.

And thank you, Matt Dinniman, for this fucked-up, wonderful universe of endless… madness? Fun?

Thank you, Jeff Hays, for bringing these characters to life.

And thank **you** for reading. This has been dragging on for too long.

*WARNING: This message is from a very impatient crawler who’s waiting on book eight.*

Some context: I was a barista for 9 months before my current job so I’m no expert but not quite a beginner either. I just got a Breville Bambino and love it, it’s so fun to make drinks again!

I was looking on TikTok for inspiration and to see other people’s stations. I noticed a lot of videos that are “for beginners” but the creator has a WDT, leveler, scale, fancy portafilter…the works.

Personally, this rubbed me the wrong way. I don’t like the notion that absolute beginners need to spend more money on tools that aren’t all necessary (imo) before they can pull a good shot. I wished these items were presented as upgrades rather than necessities. 

Sure, good beans make for a good shot, but do you really need to spend more money on a grinder and good beans when you’re just learning? I got cheap pre-ground espresso at the grocery store to get used to the machine and it does the job fine. Is it good? No, but I’d rather waste those grounds than nice, expensive beans.

So I’m curious: what extra tools have truly been a game changer for you? What has had the greatest impact on the quality of your espresso and the overall coffee-making experience? Are there any you think are unnecessary? I’ll definitely be getting a new tamper because the one that comes with the Bambino is awful, but other than that, I have a hard time justifying why I would need other tools.",3,1767735686.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

But first let me make something perfectly clear

I have zero issues with men, you're divine!

But some of your profiles are in need of refine

Allow me to explain every faux pas that irks

I'm an OCD completist, it's one of my quirks

Firstly, stop sending me your turgid erection

No, we're definitely not going in that direction

Can you post current pics that aren't Photoshopped?

And I still see your ex in that photo you cropped

Your unsmiling police mugshot is causing me dread

Remove that toupee because I like a shaved head

You're posing bare-chested in the bathroom mirror?

You're a speck on the horizon? Equally sub-par

Please take off the obligatory dark sunglasses

They don't cover our bodies or old saggy asses

Why are you showing me a humongous dead fish?

Besides, I'm vegetarian, that's so not my dish

What's with the expired deer slung over your back?

I've no interest in the biggest gun in your rack 

Or that flash compensating car you are boasting

And I'm not into beer, can you stop the toasting?

Could you possibly expand on ""Hi, how are you?""

I suspect you don't take long walks on the beach

Or proofread spelling and grammar in written speech

University Graduate yet can't string a sentence?

And flowery gushing prose doth cause me to wince

You're seeking a woman who can ""challenge"" you?

You're too much work. Board games? I have a few

I've no desire to debate a wide range of subjects

A colossal waste of time, last time that I checked

\-

""The finer things in life"" isn't floating my boat

""A sexy woman""? I'm hereby remote, you old goat

Your age range is puzzling, I scrolled past fast

We could have had a blast, now I can't be arsed

A physical appearance list signals you're shallow

Reckon it's time to evolve and become more mellow

\-

Don't need to know you can dress up or dress down

Can you stop the cliches? You're making me frown

Oh you like going out and you like staying in?

Time to throw your unoriginal profile in the bin

\-

""I know how to treat a woman"" tells me you don't

Kindly erase ""I like my women...."" Bet you won't

You say you're easygoing? I say most people aren't 

Intelligent, kind, caring? That's a common chant

""I love to laugh"". Don't know anyone who doesn't

Describe your humour to me, now there's a hint

\-

""Don't really know why I'm here!"" I don't either

""Could that be you?"" Nope. I need a breather

""I'll fill this part in later"" but you never do

Are you serious about finding a lady to woo?

""Don't know what to write. Ask me anything""

Is a relationship something you could swing?

\-

I hope this ditty has made a few things clear

And don't write what you think I want to hear

Don't try to impress me, I'll see right through

I just want a profile that shows the real you

Effort, thought and originality is all I ask

Is that really such a difficult monumental task?

1q5vykv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NewNeptuneSaturn/comments/1q5vykv/the_4th/,The 4th,"The 4th Story. The 4th Eros.

Every time I walk into the coffee shop she watches me. Not like the others Eros’, there’s no longing or guilt or neediness. I can tell she’s checking in to see if I’m ok but she doesn’t say anything or do anything. She just glances up from her laptop now and again. She works a lot. I wonder what she does that keeps her so busy and focused. 

We’ve done this for months. Me, fighting through all these Eros’ and her politely and objectively caring from a safe distance. I pick up my coffee, she observes me. She *reads* me. That’s the gist. I’m not sure what this is if anything. I’m tired of the highs and lows. I’m tired of the chase. I’m tired of old Eros’

I finally feel whole. I’m tired of trying to be smart enough, selfless and light enough, funny and clever enough…it’s *exhausting*. I free myself of the whole thing. I’d rather be alone than continue to suffer. 

Then there’s this detached Eros who seems kind but has remained a mystery. I like looking over at her when I walk into the coffee shop to pick up my drink. She’s sitting at a table with her computer, working diligently on *something*. She’s serious and beautiful…and I won’t entertain it further. I’ve been down this road before. 

I grab my coffee off the counter and turn to leave. No more Eros’.

I hear a warm voice from behind. “Hi” she says. I turn and glance sideways to see who it is. 

It’s her. 

I grip my cup more firmly. “Hi”, I respond. “Working hard as usual?” 

She smiles. “Always.”

I love the sound of her voice. I wish I didn’t. 

“We should have coffee sometime.” It’s less of a question and more of a statement. She’s assertive but in a fair way. It’s not a demand, it’s a confident invitation. She already knows I’ll say yes. 

Or will I? 

I gesture at the coffee cups in our hands. “Isn’t that what we’re doing now?”

She smirks and holds back a grin. She likes my sassy and challenging humor. “Yes, but next time intentionally and where I get to ask you questions to get to know you.” 

She says it the way I like it. Flirty, funny, playfully sarcastic, firm and sexy. 

She sets her cup down, takes mine from my hands and grabs a cardboard sleeve off the condiment section of the counter. She puts the sleeve on and hands it back to me. 

“It’s safer for you to have a firm grip on a hot coffee cup.” She smiles and walks back over to her table, back to work. 

God, she’s hot. And obviously extremely competent.

I pivot to my left, out the door into the New Year’s chill. Another Eros? Am I really contemplating this? 

3 days later we have our coffee date, walking around downtown as city workers are taking down Christmas lights and decorations. It’s quiet, peaceful and aside from a few other people it’s just us. The busy holiday season has concluded. I like that it’s not crowded. I can focus on her. I can pay attention to what I’m feeling in my body. I can breathe. 

After about 20 minutes of casual conversation, I ask her the question foremost on my mind. “We’ve been passing each other by in the same coffee shop for over a year. What made you decide to talk to me now?” I knew she was watching the whole time. I could feel it. I didn’t tell her that though. I don’t want to compromise whatever this is. 

“You weren’t ready.” 

I stop. She’s right. I wasn’t ready. Not for anything real. I was chasing Eros’ and going through the dark night of the soul. I wasn’t ready for someone like her. She’s not like the other Eros’. She’s serious. She’s direct. She’s honest. She’s *here*. 

I say it softly, slowly, cautiously and deliberately, “What makes you think I’m ready now?” 

She pauses for a moment to find the right words. She’s not afraid of a deep honest conversation and I’m immediately green flagging that. 

“I watched you struggle through whatever it was you were going through. I almost intervened several times but I didn’t want to step in on your path. My Mom taught me not to rescue anyone until they’ve found their footing and their inner light. She went through something like what you seem to be going through when I was young. I asked her about it recently, when I was watching you struggle and contemplating rescuing you. She said she’d been there (the dark night of the soul) before and that it would hurt you more than it would help you. She said if I take you seriously, then I need to wait. So I waited until you were ready so that we could have a fair shot at whatever this is shaping up to be. It’s not my place to ruin your path to healing with my presence.” 

My jaw drops. 

The 4th Eros. I felt a flood of attraction roll through me. She *waited* for me to be a whole person first. She didn’t play games, there wasn’t…

I stop. 

“I’m going to ask you one question and I need you to be clear and honest with me. Are you dating anyone? Married? Boyfriend? Girlfriend? Fiancé? Is there *anyone* else?” 

She seemed surprised by the question. “No, of course not. Why would I…” she put 2 and 2 together. 

“There’s absolutely no one else. I give you my word. I’m not that kind of person.” She says it resolutely. 

I breathe a sigh of relief. I feel safe to continue. I let my guard down a little and the conversation lightens. She understood immediately why I needed to get that out of the way. I like that she understands me. I like that I don’t have to try to be enough. I like that she likes me-as is. I like her, the longer we talk and spend time together the safer I feel. 

The 4th Eros isn’t a monster. The 4th Eros wasn’t a runner. The 4th Eros waits at the finish line because she wants real love with a whole person. 

The 4th Eros is the hottest Eros. This one I trust.

I hope you find that this topic is not outside the scope of this community. It seems like the right place to ask, and people here seem so friendly and knowledgable.

Long story short: I run a small online business in my spare time. I have a blog for students and sell digital documents, but these only generate income for a few weeks each year during exam season. Recently, the idea of importing those drip coffee bags from Japan and selling them to the students came to mind. I absolutely love them every time I visit Japan, and I would’ve loved to have them back when I was a student — we always had access to hot water, but coffee on campus was expensive.

They’re not very common in Norway and are usually only sold as high‑priced “camping coffee” or similar.

My questions are:

1. What are the most popular brands of single‑use drip coffee in Japan?
2. Does anyone have experience importing these products from Japan in relatively large quantities, how the process works and how I should go about?

I've noticed that many people recommend against naps or sleeping more even though your body is asking for it. Sort of like being extra hungry after a fast, you need to repair, you over compensated and now you need to heal from it. Surely instead of refusing to sleep during the day slows your recovery? 

And then you have the hunger that was suppressed for so long. If you don't eat back what you deprived yourself of, it'll take longer.

What do you think? Unless idk, some of you abused 500mg of caffeine everyday for years? I find it crazy that you need 1 year to heal from coffee! ",0,1767735437.0,decaf,2,0.43,False

It was just a cycle of “omg I’m sweating so much wtffff” and “calm down, you’re making yourself sweat more” 😭 and I’m still depressed so idk what I’m even on doing on this stuff.

Editing to add I also have terrible constipation that I NEVER used to deal with. I used to poop too much if anything.

Low energy creeps up slowly. Poor sleep becomes the new normal. Feeling foggy, flat, or constantly tired gets chalked up to work stress, age, or just life being busy. You adapt without really noticing you are adapting.

That’s the dangerous bit. When decline is gradual, there is no clear moment where you think something’s wrong. You just crack on. More coffee. Later nights, less movement. Promising yourself you will sort it when things calm down.

For many people, the wakeup moment isn’t hitting rock bottom. It’s feeling better and realising how long they’d been running on empty.

Better sleep. More stable energy. Less constant hunger or snacking. Waking up feeling more like yourself again. Suddenly you look back and think, how long was I calling that “normal”?

At Keltoi, we see this all the time. People don’t come in saying “I feel awful”. They come in saying “I just don’t feel right anymore”. Bloods, weight trends, sleep patterns and hormone markers often tell a clearer story than symptoms alone.

This isn’t about blame. Modern life isn’t designed for good health by default, especially in Northern Ireland winters. Long hours, stress, screens, convenience food, dark evenings. It all adds up quietly.

The real shift tends to happen when people stop asking “what’s wrong with me?” and start asking “what has slowly become normal that maybe shouldn’t be?”",2,1767735314.0,KeltoiWellness,0,1.0,False

On pourrait l'appeler avec un nom antique (pacque ça fait toujours plus classe) masculin ou feminin: Agamemnon, Moïse, Athena, Soleil, ...

Le truc serait autonome en carburant et en énergie.

Il y aurait une ferme de nourriture (champignons? Patates? Poules)

Des animaux liés a l'homme depuis les temps anciens comme des singes, chats ou chiens.

Un bloc medical.

Une base de données immense contenant les archives de l'humanité (en anglais).

On pourrait mettre differentes salles, par exemple: -cathedrale (ou mosquee au choix) -arene d'entrainement (version romaine) -Jungle avec des animaux sauvages dangereux -dortoirs communs

Le vaisseau pourrait se déplacer dans l'espace (lentement mais pas grave).

Il serait evidemment lancé au dela de l'orbite terrestre pour eviter de recevoir les débris qui tournent autour de la terre ou heurter des satellites.

L'idee de base serait de sélectionner au hasard des individus avec des matchs mâles/femelles (voire ajouter categorie autres).

Il y aurait un examen national avec des questions ou des épreuves (pas forcément basées sur le mérite hein ça pourrait être quelque chose d'un peu tordu ou enigmatique).

Et ceux sélectionnés pourraient embarquer dans le vaisseau!

Des idées?

Ce serait sympa si on pouvait lancer une cagnotte (sur un truc comme buy me a coffee) ou une petition sur le site du gouv pour recolter de quoi lancer le truc.

I'm looking for an amateur photographer to take some photos of me (portraits/full-length/black and white) this weekend in Paris.

I'm very flexible and we wouldn't spend more than an hour together. You could use the time to test your camera, have a model, and practice taking nice photos.

I'm just looking for a few photos of myself (M37) where I look good for personal use (social media).

I'll buy you a coffee afterward :p Thanks",0,1767735117.0,SocialParis,0,0.33,False

I was just watching Lus's video on Frogan not submitting anything since August. Ethan said on the pod (although he did pause to think about it) that her attorney hasn't made any settlement attempts. Lus said that sensitive information will be kept off public record if the judge sees fit. He also brought up how CoffeeZilla was able to pause his lawsuit with Logan Paul until another of Logan's cases where he is also accused of being a scammer is resolved.

Could Frogan have gone to the judge after the snark subpoena was contested and told them that she is one, hence her case needing to wait until it's determined whether the Kleins will be given the mods names? If she submitted an answer stating she wasn't a mod when she is, that would be perjury. However, if she admitted to it in a filing, that could cause legal issues for the other mods trying to remain private. Hence, the need for radio silence for the public.

This could also be a reason she didn't use the same law firm as Denims and Kaceytron. It would be a clear conflict of interest for Denims lawyer to agree to the subpoena for the snark mods names while knowing their other client is one. Lus also said in another video that Frogan's lawyer does mostly settlements. Maybe she is waiting to see how the mod subpoena turns out with the San Francisco firm while compiling information for a settlement in case the motion to quash fails. Her handing over all her chat logs with the other mods and Hasan could be a way to get the Kleins to go easier on her.

Again, this is just a theory and I am not a legal expert. Everyone leave Frogan alone for her lawyer to deal with.",10,1767735109.0,h3h3productions,3,0.78,False

Here's what I've been working on! 🙏❤️ Here is a chunk of my latest story! ... I wonder who the boy scout is... 😉,"It was midnight when I stumbled into our office with two lukewarm coffees.

Well, not exactly ‘our’ office.

Middleview North University didn’t recognize us as a real club. Apparently, “Investigative newspaper” didn’t cut it. 

When we pleaded our case to the dean, he relented and let us use the storage closet on the third floor of the arts building. Small victories. At the back of my mind, I knew exactly why we weren’t being taken seriously. We hadn’t solved one mystery.

Our whole shtick was, “We will solve any case you present us with!” Whether it’s small, like a cheating partner, or maybe even localized. Kidnapping. Missing kids. We promised to solve them. After fumbling almost all of our cases, we had one more chance to prove ourselves.

This time, with a real mystery.

Four months ago, two college students went missing.  19-year-old males, with no connections other than attending the same university. The local police were useless, so we took it upon ourselves to prove we weren’t just loser college kids trying to be Scooby Doo rejects.

As expected, the storage closet was the size of a prison cell—or maybe that was being generous.

The three of us managed to squeeze in a desk and a chair, and I still felt like I was stepping into Narnia every time I entered. 

Above my head, an old chandelier swung from a broken chain, as if teasing. 

Every time one of us opened the door, that thing seemed to get closer to ending our existence. I wanted to ask why a storage closet had a chandelier, but I had a feeling the answer would give me a migraine. 

Tonight was no different than any other. 

I was exhausted after spending my day off in the library researching the town’s local history. 

I gave up when my phone became too tempting, and I started doomscrolling TikTok. 

I only snapped out of it when a guy from one of my classes, sitting across from me, started talking about the missing boys. 

He asked me where they were, and I just shrugged and said, “We’re working on it.”

We in fact were not working on it. 

The police had already threatened us with a restraining order, so we had no access to evidence. All we had was the tiny office we called home. 

Kicking off my shoes, I ducked inside, clutching the coffees to my chest. 

Only two people were allowed inside at once, due to safety hazards or whatever. 

The university really would rather we suffocate than give us actual damn space.

“I hope you like slightly warm coffee,” I said, squeezing into the closet.

“You’re late,” a voice grumbled from inside.

On top of our desk sat a laptop and a pile of unresolved cases.

Sitting hunched over his MacBook, squinty eyes glued to the screen, was Aris Caine, illuminated in the sharp, fluorescent glow from our Ikea lamp sitting in the corner. 

Disheveled as usual, glasses perched atop thick blonde curls, hair a tangled mess hanging in overshadowed eyes. He’d spent all day running his hands through it. I knew him far too well. Aris’s habits mimicked findings. He only took off his glasses when he was pissed or had figured something out. I prayed for the latter.

For a British exchange student who exclusively wore sweater vests and spoke like a walking thesaurus, he was a prickly asshole. But he was also incredibly smart. Stupid smart.

“There was a queue,” I lied, setting his (cold) coffee in front of him. I only got his text when I was leaving campus. Then I bumped into a group of “fans” who reminded me I was useless.

I didn’t tell him that, offering Aris a smile instead. I noticed his stance—folded arms and twitching lips, like he couldn’t wait to tell me something. It reminded me of when we first met, which was perhaps the only time I’d seen him smile—his agreement to join what had been the college newspaper. Aris only smiled when he had a lead, which piqued my curiosity. 

I knew Aris like he knew me. That asshole had stubbornly sat in silence, waiting for me to come back.

He was too proud to text it. I sipped my own coffee, taking note of the slight furrow between his brows. Something was still bothering him. “You haven’t found them,” I hummed around the rim of my coffee cup. Ugh. The coffee tasted like sewer water. “But I can tell you’re close.”

Instead of responding, Aris turned his laptop around. I peered at the screen, a photo of a group of smiling kids.

It was an article from 2013 detailing Middleview’s Boy Scouts raising money for town hall renovations.

“Boy Scouts?” I murmured, leaning closer. I shot him a look. “I’m too tired to understand your brain.”

Aris’s lips pricked. “The cops said the guys had no connection,” he rolled his eyes. “Which, by the way, is a whole new level of impressive incompetence."" He leaned forward and prodded the screen. 

“As you can see, both of them were in the 2013 Boy Scouts.” Aris traced the faces of the missing boys. “Which means, at some point, both of these boys have visited a Middleview resident.” He grabbed a printout and slapped it down in front of me. “They did these bake sales every year.” He explained. “I bet their kidnapper bought cookies from them.”

I nodded, scanning the article. “So, the kidnapper targeted former Boy Scouts they bought cookies from?”

Aris shook his head, leaning back in his chair. “I’m not there yet, Nancy Drew. May is pinpointing every resident who was a regular.”

My head jerked up. “You’re not serious.”

“If they bought cookies, we’re visiting them,” Aris muttered, squeezing his eyes shut. “Chances are that the kidnapper is a former customer.” He groaned, head tipping back, pinching between his brows. 

“What be their motive, though? That is what is so… logically indefensible.”

“It’s midnight, Aris,” I said. “Please talk like a normal person.”

I knelt uncomfortably in front of the desk, mulling the information around in my head.  No chairs, no beanbags. 

All I had was the cold wooden floor. 

I stretched out my legs and drained my coffee. Aris sipped his own, made a face, and plonked it back down.  

“So, why wait years to take them?” I said, my gaze flicking back to the article.  “Why wait until these boys were adults?”

“Loneliness!”

An all-too-familiar voice startled me. Aris, as usual, was unperturbed. 

May Lee, our third and final member, stuck her head through the door, bright orange hair igniting under the light. 

Instead of greeting us as always, she was strangely silent, squeezing into the closet. 

She held up her phone. “I’ve been on the phone with the former Boy Scout leader, and after I bribed him, he gave me all of his customers' names. Past and present. And there were a lot of people.”

Aris raised a brow. “What did you bribe him with?”

“That’s not important right now,” she rolled her eyes. “Anyway, to cut a long story short, after going through each customer, there was only ever one person who bought cookies every year.” May’s eyes found mine. “Jenny Pearson. 56 years old. She spent thousands of dollars on them.”

I nodded slowly. “So, this is revenge?” I said. “For shitty cookies?”

May shook her head. “Jenny lost both of her teenage sons a year ago in a car crash,” she whispered. “Both of whom—”

Aris jumped up, his eyes wide, lips curling into a smile I knew I wouldn’t see until our next case. “Would be nineteen right now.”",2,1767735077.0,u_Trash_Tia,0,1.0,False
1q5vqph,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1q5vqph/mrs_valiant_lady_halfway_impressions/,MRS Valiant Lady Half-way Impressions,"We are sailing MRS on the Valiant Lady now. A few of our impressions thus far:

Embarkation was smooth. We dropped our bags, got a bus to coffee, and were able to sit in the waiting area as soon as we returned around 12:45. We met our MRS agent, Joshua, in the waiting area for the first time. 

Our itinerary changed because of current events. This did not affect us much aside from missing a fun dolphin adventure in Curacao. Joshua kept us apprised during the itinerary change so we had time to get the new shore things as soon as possible. 

The room is gorgeous. Giant bathroom. Wonderful bed. The bar gets restocked up two twice a day if we are day drinking. They noticed we played some vinyls and brought more. We emptied the bar the first night with new friends and got everything back plus an extra full sized Patron. They clean and rearrange for us regularly throughout the day. Our housekeepers are both awesome people. 

Unlimited laundry is amazing. I change multiple times throughout the day and then just send everything for cleaning and pressing. I will miss this most when we return home. 

The food is spectacular at every place I’ve tried. Gunbae was with a great group of people we really enjoyed. It was fun to share a bottle of sake with the whole group. The wake was delicious, and they helped us make the whole dinner take only 30 minutes so we could make a show. Pink Agave was our favorite so far. They somehow knew who we were when we walked up, addressed us by name, and immediately took us past the line. They then accommodated my request to reserve the table next to us for some new friends who were showing up after us. The Dock House gets a shout out for fabulous service and shrimp. Joshua was able to change our Test Kitchen reservations for tonight to Extra Virgin. 

The bars are excellent. Every place has an identity, which keeps menus fresh. I’ve made use of every free bottle of wine we get so far when making new friends; a good perk. All of the cocktails on the boat are under the $25 free limit, so we can try things without worrying if we will like them. 

The crew are outstanding. They are fastidious and friendly. I have enjoyed every crew interaction I’ve had so far. Sailor Services gets a special shout out for taking care of two things we needed with lightning speed. 

The happenings cast and shows are top notch. The Diva, Anastasia Krystals, is awe-inspiringly fabulous. I hope we get a chance to chat with her sometime, but she’s a busy girl. 

The guests are fantastic as well. Everyone is having fun and making the best of sudden changes. 

So far 10/10; couldn’t be having a better time. Thank you, Joshua, for making our trip so far amazing.

Look, I've spent way too many hours down the rabbit hole of attractiveness research, from evolutionary psychology papers to body language studies to interviews with dating coaches. And here's what I found: Most people who think they're average or below are dead wrong.

Your brain is wired to notice your flaws like a laser beam while completely ignoring the positive signals you're getting daily. It's called negativity bias, and it's fucking with your self-perception hard. Plus, social media has warped our idea of what ""attractive"" even means. We're comparing ourselves to filtered, photoshopped versions of reality.

But here's the thing, there are actual, research-backed signs that you're way more attractive than you think. And no, this isn't some feel-good ""everyone is beautiful"" bullshit. These are real indicators backed by science, human behavior studies, and social psychology.

## 1. People Hold Eye Contact With You Longer

This one comes straight from nonverbal communication research. When someone finds you attractive, they naturally hold eye contact longer. It's not creepy staring, it's just a beat or two longer than normal.

Dr. Monica Moore, a psychologist who studied flirtation behaviors, found that prolonged eye contact is one of the most universal signs of attraction across cultures. If you notice people locking eyes with you in conversations, at the coffee shop, or even passing by, your brain might be dismissing it as coincidence. It's not.

And here's the kicker: You might think people are staring at you for negative reasons (like something's wrong with your face or outfit). Nope. Attractive people get stared at more, period. It's just that your brain assumes the worst instead of the obvious.

## 2. Strangers Are Unusually Nice or Helpful to You

There's this concept called the ""halo effect"" that psychologists have been studying for decades. Basically, when someone finds you physically attractive, they unconsciously assume you have other positive qualities too. They're nicer, more patient, more willing to help.

Think about it. Do people randomly offer to help you with stuff? Do baristas give you extra attention? Do strangers strike up conversations with you more often than with your friends? This isn't random luck or ""just being friendly."" Studies show attractive people get preferential treatment in everything from job interviews to customer service.

If you're brushing this off like ""oh they're just nice people,"" you're missing the point. Yes, some people are genuinely kind. But if this happens consistently, you're probably more attractive than you're giving yourself credit for.

**Pro Tip**: Track this stuff for a week. Notice how people treat you versus how they treat others around you. The difference might surprise you.

## 3. People Get Weird or Awkward Around You

This one's counterintuitive as hell, but it's real. Sometimes people act uncomfortable or awkward around attractive people because they're nervous. They stumble over words, laugh at things that aren't funny, avoid eye contact (the opposite of point 1), or suddenly become very interested in their phone.

Research on social anxiety shows that people feel more pressure to impress those they find attractive. So if someone's acting weird around you, it might not be because you're weird. It might be because they think YOU'RE out of their league.

I'm not saying everyone who acts awkward around you finds you hot. But if this happens with specific people repeatedly, especially when they seem normal around others, that's your sign.

## 4. Your Friends Downplay Your Looks

Here's some dark truth from social comparison theory: People feel threatened when their close friends are significantly more attractive. It's subconscious, but it happens. Your friends might make subtle comments like ""you're pretty... for a [insert qualifier]"" or ""you'd look better if you just [insert unsolicited advice].""

This isn't about having shitty friends (though some might be). It's about human nature. When you're genuinely attractive, people close to you might unconsciously try to level the playing field by pointing out flaws or suggesting ""improvements.""

If your friends are constantly giving you appearance advice you didn't ask for, or if they seem weirdly competitive about looks, you might be more attractive than they want to admit. Real talk.

## 5. You Get Attention You Don't Want

This sucks, but it's a sign. If you're getting hit on in situations where it's inappropriate, if people are sliding into your DMs with weird pickup lines, if you're dealing with unwanted advances more than your peers, it's not because the world is full of creeps (though some people are). It's because you're attractive enough that some people shoot their shot despite the situation.

Obviously, this doesn't make harassment okay. But from a purely objective standpoint, attractive people deal with more unwanted attention because more people are attracted to them. If this is your reality and you hate it, I'm sorry. But it is a data point.

## 6. People Remember You

Attractiveness makes you memorable. Not in an egotistical way, but as a cognitive fact. Studies on facial recognition show that attractive faces are processed differently in the brain and are easier to recall.

If people remember meeting you after brief encounters, if they bring up that ""one time"" you met months ago, if they remember details about you that you don't remember sharing, your face (and presence) stuck with them.

Most people assume they're forgettable. But if you're consistently NOT forgettable, even in casual interactions, that's your brain lying to you about how you're perceived.

## Why This Matters

Look, I'm not saying any of this to inflate egos or whatever. The point is that most people walk around with a distorted view of themselves. We focus on flaws. We compare ourselves to impossible standards. We dismiss positive feedback and amplify negative feedback.

But if you're experiencing multiple signs from this list, your self-perception is probably way off. And that matters because how you see yourself affects how you show up in the world. Confidence isn't about being delusional, it's about accurate self-assessment.

You don't need to be conventionally hot to be attractive. Attractiveness is a mix of physical features, energy, confidence, how you carry yourself, and yeah, some biological stuff too. But most importantly, it's subjective as hell.

If understanding how people perceive you is something you want to dig deeper into, there's an AI-powered learning app called BeFreed that pulls from psychology research, expert interviews, and behavioral studies to create personalized audio content on topics like this. Built by a team from Columbia University, it turns complex research into customized podcasts you can listen to during your commute. You can adjust the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to detailed 40-minute deep dives with real examples, and pick different voice styles depending on your mood. It also builds an adaptive learning plan based on what you're trying to work on, whether that's social skills, confidence, or understanding human behavior better.

If you're sitting there thinking ""none of these apply to me,"" ask yourself: Are they really not happening, or are you just not noticing? Because your brain's got a bias problem, and it's time to call it out.",1,1767734977.0,SolidMen,0,1.0,False
1q5vojx,https://i.redd.it/elje4argrsbg1.png,"When dessert time hits and you're craving something unique, these sourdough ice cream sandwiches are a game-changer. This family-friendly treat combines comfort and creativity to delight everyone, even the pickiest eaters.","So I tried something a little wild this weekend sourdough ice cream sandwiches. Not gonna lie, I went into it half-expecting a Pinterest fail. I mean, sourdough and ice cream together? But we had a couple of extra sourdough discard starters sitting in the fridge, and I couldn’t bring myself to toss them (the guilt is real). Decided to use it for something fun, and the idea of sourdough desserts had me curious.  
  
The biggest surprise was how easy it was! I made soft, slightly tangy cookies from the discard, and they turned out almost like a cross between a cookie and bread. They were chewy but not too heavy. Once they cooled, I smooshed a big scoop of homemade ice cream between two of them, wrapped them up, and tossed them in the freezer. That’s it, homemade ice cream sandwiches that feel fancy but weren’t hard at all!  
  
My kids were super skeptical at first because ""bread and ice cream"" doesn’t sound like the most obvious match. But they tore into them after one bite. The tangy sourdough flavor with the sweet vanilla ice cream? Honestly amazing. Even my husband said it tasted like something you’d get at one of those fancy farm-to-table places.  
  
If you give this a go, I’d say don’t overbake the cookies they need to stay soft to freeze well. Also, experiment with flavors; I’m dying to try chocolate ice cream or maybe sandwiching some caramel or coffee ice cream.  
  
Anyone else tried weird mashups like this before? Or have favorite dessert recipes for sourdough discard? I’m officially hooked on sourdough desserts now and could use some ideas for my next experiment!",1,1767734938.0,yummyrecipesyum,0,1.0,False

She said I’m her “dream partner” and our story isn’t finished, but can’t give a timeline. We’re doing monthly calls and she’s moving to my city soon, when she moves in we will be meeting for coffee. I’m traveling, working out, casually dating—doing all the “right” things—but can’t let go of hope we’ll reconnect. Am I fooling myself?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1767734895.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

One thing I have noticed now that I have passed the 1-month withdrawal period, is that I find I am made more anxious and affected by caffeine. Every time I have had coffee recently I am feeling restless and unsettled. I am assuming it is related to the Prozac and its positive effects on anxiety, which I am no longer receiving. I am wondering if anyone else has had this experience? Thank you! ",1,1767734450.0,prozac,1,1.0,False

Decided to go old school and cope with coffee. I go out, buy a bag of my favorite coffee, and pulled my coffee machine out of storage.

It worked when I put it away. It worked when my ex-roommate pulled it out to make herself coffee and then *she* carefully put it away. (This is not sarcastic, she was literally the perfect roommate)

Suddenly it's broken, and I can't afford to replace it. So here I am, brewing the old fashioned way.

It's not *that* big of a deal, but it's annoying that I needed to jerry rigg something when I thought I had a working coffee machine.",120,1767734402.0,mildlyinfuriating,43,0.91,False
