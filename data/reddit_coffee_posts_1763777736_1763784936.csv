While I was waiting I noticed the woman next to me holding a tiny baby. I honestly thought the baby looked adorable, and cause my brain hates me I said “Aww, what a cute little potato!” Instant death glare.

I tried to explain which somehow made everything 10x worse. I start rambling like an idiot. 
“Not a bad potato! Like a good potato. A premium one. The cutest kind of potato.”
The barista is silently losing it and the mom looks like I just insulted her lineage.
Then the barista puts down a drink and in my panic to escape the awkwardness I grab it and It’s not mine.
It’s HERS.

She says, “That’s my coffee,” SO rudely. I apologize and tell her “I swear I’m not usually this weird.” Which tbh looking back sounds exactly like something a weird person would say.
I left with my actual drink feeling like a feral raccoon in human clothing.

My mom said even though calling a baby a potato is pretty normal I unintentionally insulted a new mom’s baby and then tried to steal her caffeine on top of it soooooo yeah, I’m the asshole. I feel like it was just an awkward mistake but maybe I really am TA?

It’s my first time in Seoul, and I’ll be there for 5 days. Along with doing the typical touristy things, I’d love to stay in an area where I can enjoy a good coffee in the morning and relax in the evening at nice, laid-back bars—especially listening bars or other casual spots.

I’m not into clubs, but I really enjoy casual bars that focus on good music and are welcoming to foreigners, since my Korean skills are basically zero.

1p3joa1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1p3joa1/friendship_going_downhill/,Friendship going downhill..?,"Hi everyone,

I am a long time listener from the THT podcast, and thought I would add my piece.

5 years ago I met a girl who started to work at my job, and we clicked instantly. She’s very friendly, funny, outgoing, and for the short time she was there (6 months) we were inseparable.

She quit the job, but we would text everyday, she would send me pics of her outfit of the day, or whenever she went shopping and wanted opinions. I loved that girl so much, I considered her to potentially be my wedding witness.

I would say it’s been a year and half since she’s been acting weird. We can NEVER meet without her boyfriend. Don’t get me wrong, he’s nice, but I sometimes just wanna me with my girl and talk about things I don’t want to share with anyone else than her. For context, they’ve been together for 10 years.

Every time we want to grab a drink or go to diner, she asks me to bring my man cause she wants to bring hers (mine doesn’t like hers lol). I told her once that we could only see each other alone cause…. I want to see HER. And I thought she understood.

Most of the time we’re supposed to meet, it’s always cancelled last minute.

She invited me to on a girls trip (2 of her friends) over a weekend and it went great, tho I had some apprehensions. Alone at some point she said “I’m glad you came, even my bf didn’t believe you would. You’re brave for coming out of your comfort zone, if you would have asked me to go on a trip with your friends I would have said no” and it hit me. Cause yeah I am a big introvert, I hate leaving my house, I never went on holidays with friends and for her I did. That’s I much I loved her.

At the end of the trip, we were exhausted. I was supposed to take the subway to go home from the airport, but told her I would take the uber with her instead and then take the sub since it’s easier (I’m from Paris, and it was around 10PM, I also didn’t want to be alone at night). I was following her and her fiend around the airport, slightly walking behind them, she turned and said to her friend and me “she’s like the little sister you can’t get rid off” laughing her ass. And I admit, it did hurt my feelings lol.

Next incident is a brunch we were supposed to do together to celebrate our birthdays. I’m born on the 21 April, and she on the 26. I get to the brunch, her bf is there, with two friends. They are all hang over from last night, she celebrated her birthday. They went to bed at 6, we were supposed to meet at 12 but I got no news. We finally met around 2PM. I greet her by saying happy birthday and handing her a gift, she was uncomfortable cause she didn’t bring any. I don’t care about the gift, I was just sad at this point.

Anyways, we were supposed to see each other ALONE tomorrow. She agreed. She texted me a few hours ago asking if it’s ok to bring her man cause she’s been traveling for work all week. I get that you misses your man but… that was my final straw. At first i told her it was okay, she wanted to do brunch with her bf and me. And then go grab a coffee just the two of us. I told her it was okay to meet next week if she wanted to spend time with her man. But she kept sending me messages saying no of course not let’s hang out etc. I thought I ended the conversation by telling her “no really”, as in no really spend your weekend with your man. And she keeps pushing.

We had a great friendship, but overtime it just… stopped, I guess. Thing is, I do feel guilty for shutting her out, cause I honestly like her. And then I feel guilty cause I know she doesn’t treat me right, and when I say this to my closest people, they say things like “why are you still talking to her anyway ???”

I don’t know what to do with her, and deep down it makes me sad. Sad cause I don’t want to lose her, but also sad cause she’s not being a good friend. Any advice ?",3,1763784307.0,TwoHotTakes,2,1.0,False

I’m expecting my first child and on vacation from work before going straight into a maternity leave. I work remotely, and this morning the 17 year old son of a colleague of mine died in the hospital after 3 days of battling injuries from a car accident.

Every second Friday the organization I work for has a casual, optional coffee chat teams meeting. It’s meant to catch up, play light hearted trivia games, etc. I normally don’t attend because it’s optional and honestly a waste of my time. As some of you may know if you’ve ever used Teams, people can write in the chat of the meeting and everyone in the office (all staff) can read those messages even if they didn’t join the meeting that day.

Today, I saw a bunch of messages coming through about the death of her son. Someone shared the car crash news article and people were going on about doing a slideshow for her. It was absolutely shocking for me personally to see this happening seeing the woman who’s son just died is in the group chat and may be getting notifications about this entire conversation (as I was)… if not now, she may even see these messages later.

I do get that they were trying to be supportive, but still. I just felt the setting wasn’t right.

So I said to the team in the chat:

“Hi everyone, I’m still seeing a few messages pop up on my phone while I’m on vacation before my mat leave, and I just wanted to gently share a thought. Out of respect for [her name] and her privacy, it might be more respectful to keep any conversations about how to support her in a more private space rather than in the coffee chat group chat. I know everyone’s intentions are kind. Just hoping to help protect her privacy.”

Our HR staff member then said in the chat:

[My name] - having no context of what was shared during the meeting or our discussions with [Employee who’s son died], your comments are out of line. If you have an issue - connect with [ceo name] or I directly.

Hmmm…

My best friend agrees with HR, that I shouldn’t have said anything. 

Personally though, and I sincerely wonder how others may feel, I don’t think it was appropriate to be discussing any of this in the group chat she’s in. I didn’t even mention sharing the news article in my message to the team because I didn’t want to bring attention to it.

Sounds like HR is implying they chatted with her and maybe she’s fine with us talking about it, but a part of me highly doubts that. He just died this morning! I would be mortified if my colleagues were sharing news articles about a death in my family the same day, let alone ever in a group chat.

1p3jk98,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3jk98,"Trip Report for Shanghai, a 1 day / night visit.","Trip Report for Shanghai.

My travel was 1-month in China and 4-night stop in HK from 16th August – 19th September 2025.

My travel route was Beijing – Luoyang – Dengfeng – Kaifeng – Chongqing – Zhangjiajie / Wulingyuan – Furong – Fenghuang – Wangxiangu – Hengdian Film Studios – Shanghai – HK.

I hope this information will be useful for those planning a trip to China. I’ve tried to list and describe as much as possible and highlighted some important parts. I’ve added AUD prices, the hotels that I stayed at, reviewed attractions that I visited in each city or town. Its my first time writing such a report and detailed itinerary so please be kind with the feedback. Feel free to ask questions and I will respond as soon as I can. Thanks for reading!

**SHANGHAI = 1 night** as this is my 3rd time to Shanghai...

I caught a 2hr train for $49 AUD including the Trip.com booking fee, 2nd class seat, from Hengdian train station to Shanghai Hongqiao train station then walked through an underground / covered passageway to the connecting metro station to get to my hotel. **The 1st photo attached is of Shanghai Hongqiao railway station, where you will most likely arrive to from other cities around China. The 2nd to 5th photos attached, are of the connecting metro station with Shanghai Hongqiao railway station: its really modern, clean, there’s lots of English signs and arrows everywhere... When you’re inside the metro train, look above the glass doors to see the line route and announcements are made in Chinese / English before each stop. Its very cheap and you can use the Transport tab QR code in Alipay to scan in / out of the metro or just buy a one-way paper ticket ride at the vending machine.** I paid 5 Yuan for 35min metro ride to Yuyuan Gardens metro station, purple Line 10, then it was under 10min walk to my hotel.

**I stayed at SSAW Boutique Hotel for $91 AUD = 1 night, booked via Expedia as I had points that I could use to reduce the cost, otherwise it would have cost me $145 AUD for 1 night.** They gave me an upgrade to a suite (unexpected and wow!), which includes a king bed, TV, huge closest with bathrobes, ironing board, a small round table with two chairs, a huge bathroom with a shower stand, bath tub, sit-down western toilet, dressing table and two sinks (his / hers). I didn’t book with breakfast option as I was checking out early for my flight to Hong Kong, the next day. They gave me a coffee voucher to use at their coffee station on the restaurant level and I redeemed it later that night. Its a great hotel and many foreigners / tourists stayed here. **Its approx. 30min walk to Nanjing Road and The Bund, plus only 10min walk to Yuyuan Gardens at the metro station.** I would definitely stay here again for its location, quality and price – not sure if I can get a free upgrade again though!

As this was my 3rd time to Shanghai (its a great city to enter / exit China from) there were no must-see attractions for me. I arrived at my hotel by 12pm and they let me check-into my room right away. I quickly sorted out my day bag and headed out to Yuyuan Gardens for lunch = lots of dumplings! **For example, 8 pieces of pork steamed buns with crab roe is 35 Yuan.** Now, I think, Yuyuan Gardens has changed a lot, I personally think its lost its charm. I’ve visited twice before and the last time was in 2017, where it was much more spacious, less shops, and it seemed more “traditional”. Now, in 2025, there’s a lot more shops, street vendors, shopping plaza, food court, food stall street and it feels “modernised”. I know some people will not be happy with my opinion, but it is my opinion! I’m not saying don’t visit Yuyuan Gardens or that its not worth visiting = I’m just saying, its different, that its changed...

If you’re coming to Yuyuan Gardens from the Yuyuan Garden metro station, you will walk through a street with shops. On the left side is a multi-storey building with a local indoor market selling a wide variety of items. I didn’t have the time to go in, so its on my list to visit the next time that I’m in Shanghai. **There was a street shop on this block that sells umbrellas and I grabbed a few for only 10 yuan each = lots of different colours and designs, covered in lace, floral patterns, UV protection material and they all came with a slip case. What a bargain! That’s $2 AUD and you can’t buy much for $2 AUD in Australia!!!**

In and around Yuyuan Gardens, there’s many tourist-type souvenirs like magnets, bookmarks, postcards, fans, bags, caps, tea, candy, etc. **I did see a few stores selling personalised chopsticks (you can get your name engraved or lasered on them) which I think will make great gifts.** Many stores have the same stuff and priced similarly, maybe 5 to 10 yuan price difference? The challenge is finding the colour, pattern or size you want, so if you’re on a time schedule, just buy what you like when you see it and if you’re buying a few pieces, negotiate with the staff – there’s no harm in asking!

I didn’t visit the **Yu Gardens** or the **Old City God Temple** as I’ve been inside, many years ago. Instead, on this trip, I wandered around the **Yuyuan Bazaar Market area**, walked across the **Zig-Zag Bridge with the Mid-Lake Pavilion** (can’t miss it, its near the Yu Gardens entrance), stopped at the **Chocolate Museum & Shop** (free entry, see photos 6, 7 & 8 attached), and checked out the **Fan Art Museum & Shop** (free entry, cool stop if you like art and there’s no pressure to buy – I didn’t see staff approach anyone, and I didn’t take photos inside as there were lots of people and its small / narrow sections). **I think you need at least 3hrs+ to enjoy visiting Yuyuan Gardens**, especially on a weekend and if you want to have lunch or dinner here (which I recommend as there’s lot of choice / variety), but of course, its over-priced since its a tourist attraction.

I went to my hotel to drop-off my shopping, rest for a bit then ordered **a truffle, mushroom and cheese pizza for 98 yuan** from the hotel restaurant. It was really good! I headed out to **Nanjing Road**, a 30min walk from my hotel and checked out (supposedly) **the largest Popmart store in China**, which was great! Yes, it was packed but really decorative and interesting – since I like that kind of stuff! There’s lots on display, and to buy, over two levels and the store is part of a mall at a main crossing intersection (which had police patrolling and controlling the crowds) so its in a great location! I had a look at the **Sanrio store** opposite it, then wandered down to **Animate** and a few other anime type stores – yes, Japan is better obviously! but I didn’t want to buy clothes, shoes or bags so my focus was on anime, cute cartoon merchandise on this trip.

It was past 9pm – by the time I finished shopping and it was raining… by the time I reached **The Bund**, my shoes and pants was soaking wet! It finally stopped raining while I was at The Bund, so I hanged around and snapped photos along the boardwalk as I admired the harbour views (see photo 18 & 19 attached). **A lot of the lights on the buildings change colour and there’s many short animated videos screened on some of the buildings, so its best to find a good viewing spot and watch!**

By the time I got back to my hotel, it was 10:30pm… I sorted out my luggage, went to bed and got up at 4am. **My pre-booked airport transfer picked me up by 5am and dropped me off at Shanghai Pudong International Airport within 45mins: cost was $33 AUD, reserved on Trip.com. It was a clean, modern sedan with a driver dressed in a suit and we didn’t talk throughout the ride. He did help carry my 28 inch hard and heavy suitcase in / out of the car boot for me, so I think it was money well spent – half the price compared to Sydney (with Uber or DiDi) for the same distance.** FYI the famous Shanghai airport express Maglev train doesn’t start til closer to 6am and my flight to Hong Kong was at 9:35am so it was better to pre-book. If you arrive early, you can relax, eat and shop around...

**OBSERVATION**: I think Shanghai is really westernised. I didn’t feel like I was in China – its more like Hong Kong due to the number of foreigners /tourists, compared to the other cities that I visited in China on this trip. When I was in Chongqing for 4 nights, I didn’t see as many foreigners as I did in Shanghai and if you’ve read my long-ass trip report for Chongqing, you’ll know that I visited so many tourist attractions, famous landmarks and social media hyped areas. I was only at three main tourist attractions in Shanghai for one day and I was feeling quite overwhelmed with the number of foreigners / tourists.

**Now, in case you need ideas and inspiration on what else you can see or do in Shanghai, during my 1st and 2nd time to Shanghai, I also visited the following places: **Shanghai Museum at Peoples Square** (which many redditors have noted, its not as good as it used to be since many items have been moved to the Pudong branch?) **Jade Buddha Temple**, **Xintiandi**, **Tianzifang** and **Disneyland**.

**SUZHOU**: ’ve been to Suzhou, twice, to explore different areas with different friends and one of those times, I stayed overnight... In Suzhou, I visited **Guanquin Street, Taijian Lane, Shangtang Street, Shilu Street, Pingjiang Street, took a night boat ride through the Grand Canals, went to the Humble Administrators Garden, Master of the Nets Garden, Lion Grove Garden, Lingering Garden, Suzhou Silk Museum & silk factory, plus Zhouzhang watertown.** This was pre-Covid times (before 2017), so I’m sure its changed a lot now over the years… I’m just listing these to help those planning a trip to Suzhou = to know where and what you can consider visiting…

Thanks for reading! 

Final post will be about Hong Kong, my last stop on this trip.

But I’m here to tell you something: there is dignity in good, honest, .500 basketball.

You clock in, you clock out. You win one, you lose one. No shortcuts. No superteams. Just blue-collar hoops.

These boys don’t show up tryin’ to impress the Twitter analysts or pad some MVP narrative. They lace up every night like a guy lacing up his boots at 5:30am, coffee in one hand, back pain in the other. They get on the court, they do the job. Nothing more, nothing less.

People want 60 wins. People want dominance. Well, must be nice to live in that fantasy world. Some of us live right here, grindin’ out 41 and 41. Punchin’ the clock. Breakin’ even. Paying hoops taxes.

We don’t tank. We don’t soar. We’re just there. Reliable. Like a 2004 Ford F-150 that leaks a little oil but starts every morning if you treat her right.

You know what you’re getting: a couple great wins that make you believe… and a couple ugly losses that remind you not to.

That’s not failure. That’s *balance*. That’s union basketball.

And honestly? I respect the hell out of it.

Give me that good, honest .500 ball over some bandwagon nonsense any day.

Usually I would just use chatgpt for this but it changes how he looks. The Photoshop doesn't need to be all that good, just enough to slap on a couple of gag gifts.

Every few days, they drag all this furniture into the street and host these ""block parties"" with other parents where all there kids run all over everyone's yard, yell, scream or cry into all hours of the night. You cannot enjoy dinner or watch TV without hearing them screaming over and over. What can I do? I have asked them a few times to keep off my property, when I go to leave and their toys are blocking my driveway, but they simply don't care. I will be in kitchen or living room and they will walk right across my yard inches from my back lanai. I bought this house because I had nobody in my back yard and a beautiful view that most interior rooms overlook. I even got ""walked in on"" because I was making coffee naked or in a bra trying to get ready in the morning. It's a huge violation of privacy and peace.

# Nvidia Shares Tumble 6% for Week Despite Strong Earnings as AI Investment Concerns Rattle Markets

Nvidia closed down 5.95% for the week ending November 21, 2025, despite delivering third-quarter results that significantly exceeded analyst expectations. The chipmaker reported record revenue of $35.1 billion, beating forecasts, yet shares touched a two-month low under $175, falling as much as 4.2% intraday before recovering on news that the Trump administration is considering allowing sales of Nvidia’s H200 chips to China.

The market’s negative reaction to Nvidia’s otherwise stellar performance reflects broader anxiety about artificial intelligence valuations and spending sustainability. CEO Jensen Huang reportedly told staff “the whole world would’ve fallen apart” if Nvidia had missed earnings expectations, and later expressed frustration that “the market did not appreciate” the company’s “incredible” quarter.

# Walmart Stock Soars as Analysts Raise Price Targets Following Strong Q3 Earnings and Digital Growth

Walmart received widespread analyst upgrades on November 21, with at least 15 firms raising their price targets following robust third-quarter earnings. The most bullish projections came from Telsey Advisory and DA Davidson, both setting targets at $130—representing 21% upside—while BMO Capital, BTIG, and Morgan Stanley raised targets to $125. Other notable increases included Piper Sandler at $123, Bernstein at $122, and Guggenheim at $120.

Analysts cited multiple factors driving their optimism. Strong omni-channel performance and e-commerce growth emerged as key themes, with digital operations fueling sustainable sales expansion. The retailer’s Q3 results exceeded forecasts, prompting firms to maintain or upgrade ratings including Overweight, Outperform, and Buy designations across the board.

# Wall Street Stages Strong Friday Rebound With Dow Surging 600 Points After Week of Volatility

U.S. stock markets mounted a significant recovery Friday, with the Dow Jones jumping 600 points and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq climbing over 1% to session highs. The rally came as investors attempted to erase weekly losses following Thursday's sharp selloff that pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to two-month lows. The rebound was broad-based, with the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index gaining 2% and the VIX volatility index declining. Merck and Sherwin-Williams led Dow gains, while technology stocks attempted recovery after recent selling pressure. Nvidia shares turned positive during the session after earlier weakness. The Friday session coincided with November options expiration, adding to market dynamics amid $3.7 trillion in options activity. Despite the strong intraday performance, major indexes remained on track for weekly losses following concerns about weak labor data and diminishing expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. The S&P 500's recent reversal marked its largest since April, signaling heightened volatility ahead. Notable individual stock movements included gains for Oracle, Intuit, Gap, and Ross Stores, while technology names like Palantir and AMD faced continued selling pressure. Options activity surged across multiple stocks including Carnival, Carvana, and Dell Technologies, reflecting increased investor positioning amid uncertain market conditions.

The president noted their agreement on key issues including housing construction, rent reduction, and crime prevention. Mamdani described the meeting as productive, based on their shared admiration for New York City.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I added a video I took with my phone. As you can see, he shakes a bit. Now i don't know if anything on the wikipedia states why that is, but i recognise it a lot in myself when im having a heavy caffeine overdose. So my headcannon is that Astro is mainly running on caffeine, the need to stay awake, the fear of sleeping because of the nightmares he will see. He drank coffee over and over again, in hopes of escaping those fears. Every time the elevator doors shut, he just tenses up even more. Less and less of his friends came back, until he was the one to decay. Locking himself in his room, trying to isolate himself, from the guilt of being unable to help. Tryjng to isolate himself from the nightmares, and from his friends who were turning Twisted faster than he could process. He turned Twisted in that very room, from the need to stay awake, he webt crazy. The guilt and coffee being the only thing keeping him awake.

I tell people we eventually broke up. That it was mutual, after three years because of COVID, school, distance, etc. etc. (all the rational and ""mature"" reasons)

But the truth sometimes hurts, and the truth is that we never even got there. We never got that conversation. There was no closure. She made a choice I’ll never undo be able to undo.

We started dating right after PSLE. After all the hectic stress of a nation exam. It felt good yk? To finally find someone whom you can feel ""alive"" with after one year of pure torture. Perhaps at that age we never really understood what love was, but I guess its enough that you found someone you were comfortable enough to be with, laugh with, spend time with.

COVID already hit in P6 , stretching through Sec 1 and 2. Life shrank, Study sessions became silent nights staring at screens. Friends stopped meeting. Over the two years, I thought I was keeping us together, but the distance maybe already hollowed the closeness we had. I missed the cracks in her voice, the pauses in her messages, the nights she stayed quiet while I got lost in my own world. I thought giving her space was helping. But maybe, in hindsight, I was just drifting away.

Then one day, she wasn’t there. Three years after we started dating, all the messages, all the laughter disappeared. All that was left was the shattered fragments of a boy crying over the light of his phone.

Sometimes, at night, when im all alone in the world, the thought of her creeps in again. I remember and scroll through those messages. I read her words again and again, imagining what I could have said, what I should have noticed, what I might have done differently. I imagine alternate versions of those days: if I had texted back faster, stayed longer, simply been more present.



Sometimes, the thought I hate creeps in: *if she hadn’t met me… would she still be here?* I know its Irrational, its cruel, its unfair to myself, but it lingers like a shadow in the quiet hours, following me everywhere, from the library we used to study in, to the Luckin we shared our first coffee to my computer desk.



Exams come and go. Life moves forward, relentless and indifferent. But some nights, when I sit alone with my phone on my desk, that version of me, the one trapped in those chats, still typing, laughing, falling for her, It...feels more real than the one I try to be in daylight.



Somewhere, quietly, on Instagram, I named a corner of the world after her love for stars. A faint glimmer, a constellation written in letters and light, that can't speak but helps me remember. A whisper only I can hear, a place where she still perhaps exists.



I reach the last message I ever sent her. I read it again. And then I feel it: the absence isn’t just silence. It’s a void. A ghost of what could have been.

I stare at the ceiling. For a moment, I can almost imagine her smiling back. Then, darkness fills the room as my phone shuts off.



Some things don’t end. Not even with time. They stay. Haunting. Waiting. And for three years now, almost every night, they remind me that what I lost…was never mine to begin with.

  
Life. What a paradoxical word. A word so small, yet it claims everything, her laughter, her silence, the weight of her absence. It holds a whole existence yet describes absolutely nothing about it. Maybe.....That was what she truly wanted, to be free of the broken pieces of the world that defined her.

I’m really keen to get further into coffee now the kitchen renovation is done. I’m a massive foodie and love making everything from scratch, so the idea of weighing beans to pulling a shot really appeal to me.

The problem is, that I would only be doing this 2 days a week; while my partner who works from home will be using it 5 days a week to make her coffee.

I’m trying to find a “unicorn” machine that will give us both what we want.

My partner wants something easy to use, that she can just turn on and pull a shot without too much waiting - bonus points if it has automatic milk frothing, although she is open to learning how to use a milk frother. 

A lot of the beginner coffee machines I see recommended like the Gaggia Classic are probably a bit too slow for what she would be happy with waiting. 

So I’ve ended up in a bit of a pickle, as it’s becoming difficult to find the right unit for us given we’re at two different ends of the spectrum.

Ultimately, the smaller the footprint the better for our space but we’re open to something bigger if we need it.

I’ve been looking at something like the Breville impress touch, as it seems to be quick for my partner on weekdays but probably at the max size we’re looking at.

Budget is around $2k AUD for the machine + grinder if it’s seperate.

Any advice is welcome.

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

<Romance / Sci-Fi>  

***This time reversed***  

Si paced back-and-forth as she waited for her AI to let her know it was time. Some light anxiety made it so she always showed up to places early, but heavy impatience meant she *hated* waiting. It was a miserable mix. 

*Bullfae*, she thought.

*”Thirty seconds, Si!”* Clippy chirped as his hologram formed in her field of view. 

Her augmented reality contacts let her pull up whatever information she wanted without revealing her future tech. A countdown appeared next to Clippy and he pointed the tip of his metallic bend at a nearby door. Normally, it would have taken her inside of Discount Tire Center, but in a few more seconds opening that door was gonna take her to a pocket dimension where she wouldn’t be buying tires.

The Fun Tea Friday Cafe, where everyday was Friday, appeared in random places at random times in *its* chronology, which made it hard for non-regulars to get there more than once. As a time traveler, though, Si knew when-and-where the cafe *had* appeared, and just had to get there and wait.

She wasn’t a fan of coffee or tea. The cafe had some nice baked goods sometimes, depending on who was working at the time, but Si was more of a salty-snacks woman. The reason she went to the cafe whenever she could was to see Dee; her girlfriend if their timelines were synced up, or future-girlfriend if not.

Si checked her reflection in the store window. Nose ring, eye shadow, lipstick, all looking good. The only difference since the last time she’d seen Dee was her hair; she’d grown it out to cover her ear on one side, and buzzed the other side down in a wave pattern. She was also a pinkette now instead of a bluenette.

“Think she’ll recognize me, Clip?” Si asked.

“Statistically unlikely! Your track record of meeting her with proper overlap in personal timelines is not-”


“Ugh, never mind.” She flicked the air in front of her, sending the hologram flying away.

The timer hit zero and Dee stepped into the cafe. Where outside had been neon lights overlapping with rusted steel, inside the cafe everything was warm earth tones.  Wood tables, smooth stone-slab floor, low-hanging lights with orange bulbs - *Incandescent*! So retro! - and stained-glass lampshades to add to the ambiance.

Behind the register and espresso machines, leaning on the counter, was a surprisingly blue-haired Dee. She looked up at Si and smiled, freezing Si on the spot.

*Fae, I could get lost in those eyes,* she thought. And she did. Si didn’t realize she was standing there staring until Dee waved at her and broke the reverie.

“Hey, Si,” the bluenette said, resting chin in her hand as she leaned across the counter. “Love the pink.”

“Uh, yeah, thanks.” Si ran her fingers up through the longer strands, tucking them behind her ear. “You look good in blue.”

“Oh? This the first time you’re seeing it?”

“Huh? Oh, no. Just, last time I saw you I kinda…” Si thought about how to say she barged in before remembering how Dee had turned the tables. “Actually, *you* kinda dosed me with some allergy medicine or something.”

“Riiight, the Benedryl,” Dee said with a chuckle. “Okay, so that wasn’t so long ago for you?”

“Nah, like… two weeks? Ish?” It was hard to keep track of time when you traveled through, around, beyond, and across it.

“Neat! This is the first time we’re meeting where *I’m* aware we’re dating and *you’re* not.” Dee chuckled and reached for something out of view.

“Hey now,” Si defended, “I fully know we’re dating. It’s just last time I saw you-”

“Oh shut the flay up.” Dee dropped a bag on the counter and tugged a string to open it, showing numerous gold coins.

“It’s *fae*,” Si corrected, running her fingers through the coins. She picked one up and saw the seam; it was foil.

“I’ve met some fae since I started working here, three *years* ago.” Dee winked. “Today’s our anniversary by my count.”

“Chocolate coins?” 

“There’s something else in there.”

Si dug through the gold coins, moving them and herself aside when another traveler stepped up to order a coffee. By the time it was brewed and served, Si found the key in the bag.

""A key?""

""To my apartment,"" Dee said, shoving the chocolate coins back in the bag and knotting the string to keep it closed. ""Only works as of 2026 though.""

You really don’t get along, but she agrees at a desperation to move out of this town and create a life for herself. At the same time that she moves to the city, a bunch of robberies and horrific crimes breakout in the city. Desperate to approve that she can work a case she goes home and secretly writes case reports and attempts to solve the case without any help from the police station. When she tells the friend son about what she’s doing, he immediately snapped at her and is pretty much saying that she’s not a real cop and she shouldn’t be getting involved in such dangerous activity. Then suddenly everything clicks she realizes that the person she’s been living with is the criminal she’s searching for and now she needs to get him to confess. Her move to woo him. She apologizes for the night before, and offered to buy him coffee from there. She tries to make him fall in love with her to the point where he confesses everything to her and overtime she falls in love with him too. They were together for years in the crime, still kept going, and she kept going in her career and then he proposes. During his proposal, he says everything that he’s done and tells her that he plans to pursue another career when they get married so that way they can start a family and have a safe life for their kids. Now here’s where I’m running into an issue. A part of me wants to follow the usual story trope, and have her not report him and him get a different job and they fall in love and have kids. But at the same time, her character is very justice based. And it really makes a lot of sense for her to turn him in. And even though I’ve made it clear that she’s fallen in love with him over the novel. I don’t want her to be like every other character and to choose love over justice.

Ok so I'm a graduate school student coming out of a semi-target university doing an MSc in Management focusing on Finance. Growing up I was a nasty fucking kid, like really awful wanted to party get drunk and smoke a shit tone of weed. Due to my family's background, not super wealthy or anything, but nice solid middle to upper middle class, I was made to attend college, and by some miracle I did super well. finished top of my class and grinded my ass off. During college i changed a lot, stopped hanging around the high school crowd that loved the so called good life and surrounded myself with people that valued education. Opted to pretty much stick with the group of friends that ""had a future"". I should add that I did not incur any debt, as both my parents paid my tuition. I did manage to secure a first placement at a big bank, working as an analyst, even before finishing undergrad. But before even finishing, I knew I wanted to attend graduate school, seeing all my buddies going down the same path. The placement at the Bank ended up going pretty well, I got an offer after 6 months but decided not to take it... had my sights deadset on grad school. Got into a pretty decent grad school, got my grades all god, miraculously did not fail any classes. I tried my hardest, really tried hard networking, saw some grad school buddies getting offers from big banks and top consulting companies. Had some grueling interviews, talking like 4 to 5 rounds, but so far unlucky. Knew some people who failed like 2 to 3 courses and had secured pretty freaking awesome positions but not me. The problem now arises, I failed getting an internship and I've been home for the last 4 months, because in all my infinite wisdom, I decided to take an academic break in this first semester. Before embarking on this my mom and dad told me that I would have grad school paid for. It was a pretty tacit verbal agreement, but now i feel the rug being proverbially pulled right beneath my feet. My mom decided to, and if I may be a little humorous, pull my financing. I was told I was ""Doing absolutely nothing for my future"". Meanwhile I've been sending around 1 to 2 CVs daily, but I kid you not, the call-backs for interviews have stopped since late September (those of you in the know of graduate employment schemes will understand). I was told I had to find a job and write my thesis. The thing is I'm not an executive Master's or an MBA student, so my university will NOT accommodate this. I'm pretty much stuck with dissertation seminars during business hours. To add to the clusterfuck, the guidelines for the dissertation semester prep seminar advised a total of 35 to 40 weekly hours devoted to writing the dissertation. Ive tried telling my mom that the landscape is harsh, right now getting a solid graduate position is tough as shit, but she won't have it. Got around 3,2k saved, and have 4k left to pay. I'm obviously not getting an internship now with the start of the next semester around the corner. I would have around 1K after all is said and done after going halfsies with my dad, but I feel like I'm at a point of no return with my mom. what would you guys do ? know I'm pretty fucking privileged and this really is a non-issue when compared to other folks' problems, but honestly what would you do? The way u see it I could, get a less demanding part-time gig, like restocking at a local grocery or at a coffee shop. Should I say fuck my savings and just keep grinding and do the dissertation full-time? I would say that my mom pretty much despises me, and sees me as a slouch that only aims to be a NEET, so talking to her could be a possibility, just not a very reliable one...

Again pretty privileged problem to have, but any inputs would be nice, I fucking just hate my predicament... I feel that I worked my ass off just to be in a clusterfuck of a situation.

TLDR: An MSc Finance student is struggling to land a job in a tough market. Despite a verbal agreement to pay for school, his mother has cut off funding for his final dissertation semester because she perceives him as lazy for not having secured a position yet.

The thing is he’s brought up to me that he believes that couples should split costs based on the ratio that they earn. If he makes more, he pays the bigger chunk and vice versa. Now, I’ve always been accustomed to never needing to cover the bill but I agreed that, that seems right. We’re also both full time students so that’s our main focus, not working. However he makes way more than me (i mean I literally only work every other weekend bc I have school M-F and he has school T, TH so he has more availability ) and yet he still asks me to split EVERYTHING. He asked me to Zelle him $6 for coffee today, that he got a discount on, it was $12 total for both our drinks. We’ve gone on two dates in the past month we’ve been going out and he did cover the first one completely but I didn’t love that he brought up the money convo while we were on that first date. So I’m just getting a little annoyed that we established we would do something (split cost by income ratio) but we’re not really doing it. I mean he does drive us everywhere bc I don’t have a car, does that come into play?? Am I overreacting with the little things? It’s only been a month but each week it gets closer and closer to splitting cost just about even but that’s not what we agreed on. ",2,1763781298.0,AmIOverreacting,16,0.75,False

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip.

We met at work and started talking when she was transferred to a different location. We talk on the phone on the way to work and back and text throughout the day. We cannot see each other that much, due to reasons I'll explain later. My whole life revolves around this girl. I chose my days off around hers, the time I wake up, the time I go to sleep. My day around her availability to talk on the phone. Literally every aspect of my life revolves around her. I see her about 4 times a week in the morning to bring her coffee and sometimes a gift. As far as the sex part goes, we've probably bumped uglies 10 times. 

Here's where it gets messy, confusing, depressing, and hurtful.

She currently lives with her boyfriend?/baby daddy. I say that with a question mark, because I don't know what is going on with it. He's in her phone as Baby Daddy, never talked about him before we started talking, and would always refer to him as baby daddy or his name and that was only with situations involving her daughter. Her baby daddy also works for the same company. I've subliminally gathered information about him from people that worked with him. He won a bunch of money from a casino and told another (""hot"") girl he would never buy an engagement ring or any jewelry for her. That it was his money. He bought that same (""hot"") girl food, trinkets, and anything she wanted at work. ""Hot"" girl also shared with me that she felt their relationship was weird. It sounded more like co parenting, they don't take all the same time off from work and don't vacation together. I've recruited more information about the two of them, subliminally, from a couple more people and the story all sounds the same. 
When she talks about ""the house"" for lack of better words, it seems like everything is everyone for themselves. She has to pay for half of everything, no exceptions. Even if that means she goes without. His truck is also in her name due to his poor credit. 
Around the house, she does everything. Cooks, cleans, and takes care of their daughter. She was recently diagnosed with Autism and struggles listening and with her behavior. She was been kicked out of 2 daycares since we've been talking due to violent behavior. She does everything for their daughter. I feel like the autism came from the father's side. I know it's weird, but I knew the child had it a year ago as I was around it a lot growing up and could tell from her behavior and facial structure. The father also has a very slow mind. Trying to be nice, he's not the quickest. Not trying to be mean...  They normally do not have the same days off due to childcare, but lately have had the same day. They also go on vacation together sometimes without their daughter. 

I am head over heals in love with this girl. Her ""love language"" is gifts and I give her anything she wants. I also, on my own, gift her her favorite things. She likes typical girly things. Jewelry, clothes, make-up, skin care, food, cups, stationary, etc. I have even learned what she uses for each skincare and make-up, colors, brands, etc. and gift her at random those things. I've given her about 10k worth of gifts in a year in 9 months on a 120k year income. I sacrifice a lot of my extra money on her. I've gone without food some days to try and make her happy. She has pretty heavy emotions and am always there for her. A lot of ""bad"" stuff happens in her life and I'm always apologizing, listening, or trying to help. I put bad in quotations because it can be a simple road block in her day that brings her down. 
The sex part is important in relationships, so it should be mentioned. We've had sex about 10 times. Of the 10, 6 were probably in the first year with 4 in the first 3 months. Since it's all on the low, it's either been in my car on her break or at my house and we leave shortly after. Do the deed and drop her back off at her car. She seems to enjoy the sex. I'm not a sexpert by any means, but I've always gotten compliments on how I go down on girls and it drives her wild. I'm gathering she has never been the focus of pleasure in the past. She has complimented my work down there a bunch and seems to like what I do with the little guy too. She's on a couple of occasions said that was her favorite part of me. I make sure she gets a couple everytime we have sex. 

Here's where it gets hurtful and need advice. It seems when it has anything to do with my ""needs,"" it's not important. Wherever I bring up what I am to her, I never get a clear answer. She's called me pookie and daddy. But hasn't called me either in awhile. She's not the best with affirmation whether it be compliments or even things that make me feel wanted. Like doesn't volunteer I miss you, thinking about you, or anything that makes me feel like I am thought about. I'll ask her questions or for things that makes me feel wanted and commonly it'll be deterred or ignored. I ask about it, she says a reason she didn't answer and will ask me to reminder her later. I will remind her and sometimes she'll answer, sometimes it goes in a loop. She often will leave me on read or delivered, especially if around bd. Sometimes for hours. Especially if they are out of town. We used to send pictures of each other quite a bit, even spicy pictures. Now the picture of her is rare because she says she doesn't like the way she looks and they spicy pictures haven't happened in almost 6 months. This uncertainty, wishy washy behavior, and lack of reciprication is very hurtful as I love her so much. She is the prettiest girl I have ever met. She has lost 60 pounds since we've been talking, but has always been gorgeous. We both say we love each other every day. 

What I'm gathering is either she is using me for gifts, pleasure, and attention. Or she actually does love me and is stuck due to a child that's a handful, a baby daddy that can't survive on his own and feels obligated to help her daughters dad. 

I asked her about a year ago if she loved him as the father or her child or as a partner and she said both. Since then, I have noticed little things that point at their love growing apart, but mine and her love also has felt the same. 

Any advice on what to do would be great. I would really like to hear a female perspective on what she believes is going on with the girl.",1,1763780894.0,relationshipadvice,2,1.0,False

Hi, 24F. Ask ko lang since nangyari to sakin kahapon. May workmate ako obviously lalaki siya 30M. Wala pa ko 2months sa company nagcoconfess kagad na gusto niya ako?

Pero may mga ganon ba talaga na nagcoconfess kagad kahit di pa naman kilala nang buo yung tao?

She kind of gave me mixed signals. At the end of the date she said ""I'm interested in being friends, but would like to see where things could lead, but didn't feel much of a romantic spark on our first date"" (which kind of sucks because I even gave her chocolates as a romantic gesture and was trying to be romantic) she also said ""I'm a bit of a slut"" for some reason. Not sure why she included this in there. (**I'm not joking either, I really don't know why she would have said this. Maybe she was nervous and it just slipped out?**)  

She seemed to enjoy the date and gave me her phone number, and asked me to text her when I got home. So it seems like she could be potentially interested after a couple more dates potentially? 

Should I let her take the lead and have her ask me out again? Or should I ask her in a few days if shes interested in doing something again? 

At the beginning of the date we were talking about museums, and I happened to drop to her ""if you want we can go to a local place here in town I know about"" and she seemed interested at the beginning. But then at the end of the date when the coffee shop closed, she seemed disappointed/relieved the date was over.

I’m 24 years old, graduated from law school in May, and took the bar in July — and I failed. It was my own fault in some ways; I had to work about 40 hours a week to pay rent, and I struggled to dedicate my limited free time to studying. Now I’ve moved back in with my parents, I don’t have a job, and I have no prospects. I’ve applied to around 50 jobs in the last month and have barely heard back from any of them.

I worked as a law clerk at a firm, and the experience went very poorly. My caseload was enormous, and the IT department took forever to set everything up. On my first day, I walked in and the secretary moved about 50 case files into my office and said she couldn’t wait to get them off her hands. I had expected a learning experience, but instead I got in trouble for missing an attorney’s mistake during my first week — not a typo, but an actual legal error I had no way of knowing about. Without going into a full rant, I lost 10 pounds in a month, cried daily, and ended up quitting on bad terms for the first time in my life. I’ve never had such a negative job experience. I’ve always been known as a dedicated, hard worker; I never half-ass anything career-related. I was in complete shock.

Now I’m convinced I can’t be an attorney — so convinced that I can’t bring myself to apply to another firm. I’ve had multiple legal jobs before, including a paralegal position that I loved and only left to gain more experience aligned with my classes. I’ve completed several internships and left all of them on great terms, with references and great connections. But now, even though I’m planning to take the bar again in February, I keep wondering what the point is. My career feels like it’s falling apart. I can’t even get a receptionist job, and I feel like I’m obviously not smart enough to hold my own in a firm.

I wake up just to go back to sleep. I have no motivation to study. I lie in bed and stare at the ceiling. And then every time I start pitying myself, I have a massive reality check: I have a family who fully supports and loves me and lets me live at home for free. I have chickens that I adore, two dogs, a niece, siblings, and a loving, supportive boyfriend who shows up with random iced coffees and holds me while I cry. I had the privilege of earning six years of higher education (I even graduated college early). I even have the privilege of being in debt because I had the opportunity to take out loans in the first place.

I constantly think about how much worse things could be, and then I feel guilty for being upset about my own situation. I’m struggling with the repetitiveness of my days. I wake up just to sleep again. I’ve been working since I was 13, and now I sit around all day. I would kill for a job — for the chance to show someone how hard of a worker I am. I would kill for someone to give me a chance. I know people have it worse, and I wish I didn’t feel the way I do, but I don’t know how to fix it.

Im honestly not really looking for a response, I felt compelled to get my feelings out somewhere and know I most likely just need to grow up learn from my mistakes and move on.",3,1763780598.0,youngadults,1,1.0,False

1p3ige3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1p3ige3/my_2018_saga_iv/,My 2018 Saga iv,"The inpatient facility at Banner was one of the nicest I stayed at. Checking in cost me my whole yearly deductible. I had spent 3 months in the Texas State Hospital for the whole killing POTUS  talk under going a dangerous risk assessment and banner was the Ritz in comparison. There was a self serve coffee machine and every room had its own shower. 

My goal from the start was to return to stable without drugs and the doctor had other plans as I would find out. The only downside I saw was that Banner was a non-smoking campus and I had to rely on nicotine gum to keep the withdrawals at bay.

 Another patient suffering from withdrawals was Jay. I first saw her sitting in front of the telephone in the fetal position with her feet on the chair and her knees pulled into her chest. She was wearing scrub pants and a long sleeve shirt. She was above average in the looks department but not someone who would force you to take a second look. We went down to the cafeteria for dinner and then I watched a movie with an black man who had a very serious demeanor think Samuel L. Jackson. I did not get much sleep that night due to the mania but at least the floor I was on was quiet. 

Nothing much happened in the morning except for me declining the drugs the doctor ordered. I had been stable for years without mood stabilizers or antipsycotics. The doctor did not know in my manic state I had kidnapped a pedo to kill him in front of his useful idiot of a friend. We went to breakfast before group therapy on the floor. 

I don't remember what the topic for group therapy was because Jay and I derailed it. I started it by bringing up why do doctors think everything is treated with drugs; the answer to me is obvious now but at the time I was naive to the idea that doctors explored all possibilities. Jay then followed up by asking why do they, the doctors always want to classify patients always want to classify patients as either DTO or DTS, danger to self or others. It was not so much the questioned she asked but how she asked the group therapist that peaked my interest.

Jay was no longer wearing a long sleeve shirt and her personal battle scars demonstrated that she fell into the danger to self category. After group concluded I introduced my self to her and I began to fall in love as she would put it. Jay was in the hospital because she said she wanted to kill herself. She told me her real reason is that she had nowhere else to go and was surfing the system till she landed on her feet. 

We talked and talked about ourselves and are situations. She was on probation for something I never got the answer but I do remember seeing a video on her Instagram if her handcuffed behind the back at night sitting on the sidewalk making faces for the camera. An aside when the police are dealing with the mentally ill going to a locked inpatient they lock the cuffs upfront for crimes it is usually behind the back. 

My mother eventually came to visit me in the hospital to see how I was doing. I invited Jay over to explain what services open up when you are designated Beverly mentally ill(SMI) in Arizona. My mom gave me 20 dollars for the more luxurious items in the cafeteria. With Jay being homeless I felt the money would be better served helping her. Jay was very grateful and I was just happy to have someone to talk to that on the surface was more fucked up than me. Jay had several suicide attempts in her history. She even slit her throat for one of them. 

I had met with the doctor several times and things were not going well. He kept pushing lithium on me saying that my mom said I did well on it. 


I started taking lithium midway through my 3 month stint in the state hospital. I was adjusted to the program was getting 8 hours of sleep after falling asleep at 2 am regularly, kept busy with adult coloring, pacing the long hallway and listening to NPR on my portable radio. I might have been in jail with drugs but I was comfortable thanks to my family's support. My mom would make the 2 hour drive from Highland Village several times a week and we would also talk on the phone everyday. She did everything in her power to get me out of that hell hole. 

It seems to me people put little credit into the small things having a big impact on an individual's mental health. The food at the state hospital was lacking in terms on quantity. I am 6 2 and was being fed the same portions as a 100 lb female but thanks to my mom I always had enough net calories over the weeks due to her visits. My situation was rare. Most of the committed never got any visitors. We usually had the visitor center to ourselves. It was not the lithium that made mood better it was not being forgotten in a place like the state hospital. 

Jay and I continued to get to know one another and decided that we should act as patient advocates for ourselves. Jay talked about how she kicked fent amd did not want to be prescribed benzos and I just did not want to take anything period if I could. At the time I had taken only benzos to go to sleep and would engage in med seeking behavior to get injected with Ativan. After the first dose one patient commented how high I looked and I was high it felt great and I got a good night of sleep after. 

Eventually the doctor gave me an ultimatum that Ai was going to be petitioned if I did not take lithium. Again I refused and the spiral into to hell started. The doctors saw how close Jay and I were getting and wanted to split us up. Upon them taking me to a different floor I grabbed Jay and attempted to kiss her but she licked my face instead. While on the new floor waiting for the ambulance to take me away I was on direct one to one supervision by a technician. 

The ride in the ambulance was uneventful but where's ended up changed my view of the mental healthcare system forever. Community bridges has two locations in the Phoenix area. They are the starting point if you are taken by police.for evaluation. They strip you of your clothes by force if nessicary give you paper scrubs to wear and show you to a chair and give you a blanket. They are colloquially know as chair rooms. My theory as to their existence is to stem the flow of the homeless into the mental healthcare system. Once you get a SMI status everything is paid for and people like Jay sometimes use facilities like a hotel. 

I spent three days in the chair room being regularly injected with Ativan to fall asleep and forget the madness. Fortunately the doctors at Community Bridges did not see any reason to keep me and related me to the custody of my mother. Problem was I was suffering from benzo withdrawls. 

Now back at home base without a job suffering from drugs the doctors prescribed it was like 2015 all over again.

1p3ife0,https://i.redd.it/q8yl0mzl1q2g1.png,“Are you sure you want to stay here?”,"Suddenly I woke up and there I was, solid and unmistakable me.

I can hear the shower. I am alone in the bed, but I can still feel her warmth by my side. She must have woken up just before me. Still feeling kind of lazy, I get up and drag my feet to the kitchen, drink a glass of water and decide to prepare the breakfast before she leaves the bathroom. Japanese would be too much of a hassle, but eggs and bacon are too boring, isn’t there anything in the back of the cabinet? Hm, nothing really. I start boiling water for the time being. Maybe the freezer? Oh, when was the last time we ate waffles? The expiration date is for last week but... it should be alright, shouldn’t it? Google says so, and it’s close and all, so better than throwing it away.

She arrives while I am still setting up the table, beautiful as always. Her hair is wrapped in a towel, some stray purple strands swaying in front of her face, but the scent of her shampoo permeates the ambient, mixes with the food. It’s sweet.

“Good Morning!!!”

Ina greets me like the sun just before I have the chance to speak and I stutter my way through a “Morning”. A soft laugh leaves her lips. Good thing I stammered, then. We talk about our plans for the day over the food; she is going to spend the day at home, drawing for a game and I will have to fight the cold until I get to office. I say am jealous of her. The same conversation as always. It’s staple food, as comforting as rewatching over and over a movie you like, and I love her so much.

We part with a kiss at the door, like any newlywed couple, even if we aren’t exactly newlywed anymore. How long as it been? Hm… well… it doesn’t really matter.

So, I’ve been having a strange recurring dream recently. I rarely have dreams and the few I still remember are from childhood, but these last two weeks I always wake up with the clear memory of this single dream. I am puzzled about its meaning, maybe is there something wrong with me? Stress from work or something? The dream is not identical, but I call it recurring because the setting is the same. It goes like a whole “life”, with a clear cycle. It begins with a fake awakening in the morning, I live through an entire day, and it ends when I go to sleep. I would be scared if the dream was vivid, but much of it feels clearly delusional, so I have been postponing any “I am becoming insane” conclusion.

In the dream, I am still in the college and don’t have many friends. I do talk with other people, but never go out nor do anything interesting. It’s very boring to be honest. Most of it is just going to classes then back home, scrolling through social media, playing games. Some of the characters I remember from my youth, some I don’t think I ever saw. But the most glaring detail is that Ina is there despite how I didn’t meet her until I started working. And, there, she is not really a person but some... cartoon character?

In my dream world, it seems that Japanese animation took off hard. So, some girls started making live streams using these “anime” characters as avatars. They have real time motion tracking and everything. The just play games or talk with the public through a text chat. I can’t think of a good comparison, but if I recall correctly there was a short fad like that around ten years ago. Maybe it’s from back then that I got the idea.

So, in the dream, Ina is one of these “Vtuber” girls and I am a big fan of her, enough to say that the hours watching her “streams” are one of the happiest times of my day. Her personality is not exactly the same and the drawn avatar doesn’t capture her real cuteness, but she can be pretty endearing. I could understand why the dream me would get hooked (I chose her to be my wife, after all).

During the first days it was just this monotonous cycle of college, games and Youtube, but, surprisingly, the dream’s plot progressed. In the dream, I also started having similar recurring dreams, but of a life like mine, where I am married to Ina instead of just watching her on a screen. However, there, the dreams are becoming vivid enough to be distressing, as if they were enclosing “my” life. What seemed a paradise at first, the possibility of having a date with your idol, slowly turned into nightmare.

Could be a Lovecraftian plot, and the dream Ina indeed plays as a priest (?) for the ancient gods or something. It’s weirdly fitting. I should congratulate my mind for making up such an intricate story, but it likely is just being affected by my own anxiety about the dream itself. Is this some kind of Inception? Maybe I should get checked after all.

My day goes by without a hitch and it soon is evening. There are few sensations better than going home. I don’t hate my job. In fact, “coding” those spreadsheets feels satisfying, not too hard, but also not so repetitive as to make it stale. But I’d be lying if I said it isn’t tiring. And, most of all, Ina will be there.

“Welcome home.”

As soon as I open the door, screamed all the way from the living room. She is lazing around again. I really am jealous of her. She waited me for dinner. Because she can’t cook. I mean, she has been learning since we married (I am her guinea pig), but she still prefers mine or take out. There’s still enough from her lunch, so I reheat it and we eat together again.

We spend the rest of the day together, hugged on the sofa. Occasional kisses while watching a movie. My pick, yesterday it was hers. It didn’t end up being too interesting. Then bed. Should we go out somewhere next weekend? Come to think of it, how long has it been since I went to an arcade? We aren’t in the mood for sex today, so we make up plans that might or might not come about while dozing off.

“Good night\~ … … … … *are you sure you want to go back?*”

Her gentle voice sends me back into my dream.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suddenly I woke up and there I was, shaken, drenched in cold sweat.

A well lit room. My room. I check my phone, 4 am. I had fallen asleep, and had the same nightmare. Again. I look around, it looks the same as when I dozed off two hours before, but the afterglow of the dream makes me doubt my eyes. They see figures in the shadows, and my ears hear steps between the humming of the computer. I am still sleepy, and anyone would tell me to go to bed, but I drag myself to the kitchen and start boiling water for coffee. Black. There are no more energy drinks in the fridge, when does the closest market open again? I take the cup to my lips. Bitter. I hope this taste is enough to keep me awake now that my caffeine tolerance skyrocketed. This has to last until sunrise at least.

I try not to remember the dream, to distract myself with random videos, but I can’t. The same dream has plagued my sleep for the last three weeks. It isn’t exactly the same every time, it’s more like the same world. It goes like a whole “life”, with a clear cycle. It begins with a fake awakening in the morning, I live through an entire day, and it ends at night. I can never remember exactly how it ends, but I always wake up fearing for my life.

I think the first time I had it was when I blacked out while watching an Ina doodling stream. Her soothing voice easily guided me to Hypnos’ arms after a stressful exam week. I was ecstatic when I woke up: for the first time I had dreamed with my oshi and it was the perfect newlywed life. We had breakfast together, talked about what we needed to buy for the house, planned the honeymoon trip for as soon as I could get time off work. Then I went to the office while she stayed at home, an artist’s remote work sure is easy. I came back home, we chatted, had dinner, bathed together, watched a dumb movie, fucked.

In the following day, I rejoiced again. Back then I might have wished I had to wash my underwear every morning. Then the next. And the next. And each time the dream became more realistic. Complete. It breathed with life. A life I could never have myself.

I yearned for it, but, at the same time, it started to feel like a devil’s bargain. My guts told me something was wrong. I tried to scrutinize the dream, find out what irked me off, but I just couldn’t remember, so I avoided thinking about it.

And with each night, I noticed I felt drowsier through the day, I began to slept through my alarms, and the dream grew longer. A nap during class was enough to love Ina for a whole day. To go to a museum, a zoo, an arcade, as fast as blink. I got scared, as if I was speeding through time, living months in a week. The last time I talked to my someone felt like so long ago, and my wedding with Ina, which never happened in the dream, turned into a dearly memory I could never forget.

I went to a doctor, but they said there’s nothing wrong with me. I must not sleep again until I fix this. But what am I supposed to do? My only peace is watching Ina stream and thinking about the little differences between her and the dream. To assert to myself they aren’t the same girl despite being so similar. Whenever paranoia makes me wonder if I am the dream myself, I can tell this is the real Ina. My solipsistic imagination could never replace her.

And yet, I doze off and meet Ina again and am so sure SHE is the real one and this one is no more than a shadow on the wall of a cave.

I look at the lamp until its afterimage is imprinted to my vision, trying to stay awake. Ina is still streaming on the computer screen. I can’t see her clearly. How I would want to be married to her… I want to hear her talking. I disconnect the speaker and let the audio echo through the messy room.

I close my eyes and listen to her angelical voice.

Doing laundry is exhausting, holding anything “heavy” like a pot of water makes me heart rate high, or walking after eating. I get very sleepy after eating anything or drinking a smoothie. i don’t drink coffee or soda. rarely when i need energy i’ll get half decaf. i do love matcha but try to get it when i know i’ll be resting at home and not walking. 

HISTORY/MEDS: I was sick for 4 months with a respiratory infection (never covid) end of 2021 before getting my diagnosis. i originally was on metoprolol in 2022 for a few months but stopped because i would get sweaty bad nightmares waking up with my hair/head wet. i went a few months without medications. in 2023 i moved out of state for school and had to walk a short distance to school and my heart rate walking normally went to 200s, out of breath, and chest pain. then the cardiologist put me on atenolol. i was on it for 2 years and just titrated off this september. as of last month i have not been taking any medications. i stopped the medication because my blood pressure was severely dropping and my HDL labs were low. along with slow metabolism and weight gain. 

I been trying to get medical help since being off my meds. I went to the ER this week because my heart rate at work walking was 175s and I could not sit down because I am in the medical field and have over 20+ patients to take care of.  I was having chest pain for a long time. The ER just discharged me to follow up with PCP. My chest x-ray, labs and EKG were normal. Previously my 2 EKGs have shown short PR intervals. 

Every morning I wake up and my heart rate is 130s with palpitations. At work it’s 150+ walking or just walking outside it’s also 150+. If I try walking after eating or try gym machines it’s 170-180s. I stopped cardio, gym, hiking, pilates and hot yoga. Those were all things I loved but I can barely walk without being out of breath. I don’t know what to do other than wait to be seen by a cardiologist again. It’s tiring living each day out of breath and extremely fatigued.

**The Moment Everything Clicked**  
Every now and then, a project gives you a gentle reminder that nobody is immune to miscommunication, no matter how many years you’ve been doing this. I had one of those reminders this week, and it cost me twelve hours of coding that produced something technically correct, but practically wrong.

The client explained what they wanted. I listened. I nodded. I even repeated parts of it back to myself. Then I built exactly what they described. The only issue was that what they described wasn’t quite the thing they were actually envisioning. And here’s the important part: I didn’t ask enough clarifying questions to uncover that gap.

**Why Misunderstandings Happen**  
It’s easy to fall into the trap of believing you understand something because the explanation sounds straightforward. But in reality, most people are explaining the picture they see in their mind, not the one you need in order to build perfectly.

That’s where the process comes in. Requirement validation. Examples. Mockups. The annoying but essential back-and-forth that prevents assumptions from sneaking past both sides.

If I had slowed down and pushed for more detail or asked the right follow-up questions, I probably would have caught the mismatch. Instead, I trusted the description at face value. The client trusted that they had explained it clearly. And somewhere between those two good intentions, the actual requirement slipped through a crack.

**Owning My Role in the Mix-Up**  
This wasn’t a case of a difficult client or a messy requirement. It was a case of me not digging deep enough, and both of us thinking we were aligned when we weren’t. That’s why the project management process exists in the first place. It protects the timeline, the budget, the relationship, and your sanity. It forces clarity before code, which is always cheaper than clarity after code.

**The Takeaway**  
Ask more questions. Ask better questions. Ask the questions that feel obvious. Ask the ones that feel repetitive. Ask the ones your brain tries to skip because you think you already understand.

Because it’s a lot easier to spend ten extra minutes clarifying than twelve extra hours rebuilding.

And make sure your coffee is still warm before you start rewriting everything. - or in my case, a frosty white Monster Zero.

42M from the UK here, looking for some honest advice on where to live in Dubai. I did a 1-month trial in Dubai Hills last year and, while it’s nice, I actually felt a bit isolated there.

What I’m looking for:

* Good gym/fitness options (ideally walkable or very close)
* A bit of community / social vibe – somewhere I can actually meet people
* Healthy activities nearby (walking, classes, yoga, sports, etc.)
* Cafés/coffee shops where I can work or just hang out
* I’m 42, single, not a party animal, more into a chilled but social lifestyle
* Budget around 90k-100k for 1 bed

I keep seeing a lot of negativity about living in Dubai on Reddit – loneliness, superficiality, cost of living, etc. It would be really helpful to hear from people who actually *enjoy* living there:

* Which areas would you recommend for someone like me? (JLT, Marina, JVC, Greens, etc. – would love specifics)
* Any gym + neighbourhood combos you’d recommend?
* Anything you wish you’d known before choosing your area?

Honest pros and cons are welcome. I’m trying to figure out whether I should give Dubai a proper shot and, if so, where to start.

This would be kind of along the lines of Percy Jackson, though you dont get a camp to go to you do get your own Mentor.

Not looking for anything super long term, something shorter would be a little better for me as I tend to work 6-7 days a week. I dont need immediate replies and I will get back you quickly, as is my own etiquette. 

Anyhoo, break time is over. I don't care how you identify, this RP can be for *anyone*, so if youre interested, reach out!

• A super-soft throw blanket that looks high-end but is under $25  
• Cozy socks that feel like cloud slippers  
• A mug-warming plate for people who never drink their coffee hot  
• Everyday items that every woman I know actually uses.

My (24M) female best friend (25)  is getting married in February, it's a dream destination wedding and I'm really excited cause we used to speak about how her wedding is gonna be and now it's happening!!! The guy is very calm, mature, well paying job, rarely drinks, doesn't smoke. I've met him a few times and we vibed on movies and Fifa really well! Even my friend has a well paying job and she is excited about the power couple image. This is an arranged marriage for context.

Now, our friendship has crossed over 10 years and I know every minute detail about her life. Her first bf, her first kiss, and even when she lost her virginity cause we are crazy close to each other and just share things (not in details of course).

Now, this friend, let's call her D has had multiple partners in relationships, situationships, flings etc. A rough count will be around 15-17 that I know of.

Yesterday, I was just talking to her about the travel plans and all cause we are planning to take a trip with our childhood friends before the wedding. She told me she wants a 'closure' from all the guys before she steps into her new life and my mind went 'WHHHAAATTTTT???'. Then I thought I'm misinterpreting and overreacting and so I clarified her with 'Closure means a coffee date closure, right?' and she said 'Nahiiii, I mean a last time together closure so I can have fun for the last time before beginning my new life'

My mind went numb, thoughtless, I didn't know what to speak!! The guy she is marrying is genuine amazing, good height, decent build, chill in nature, their family also seems pretty forward from what I've heard...

I don't kmow what to say or do, is this right? Does everyone do it? Am I just overreacting?

They are yet to exchange rings, should I tell him? The ring exchange ceremony is in 2nd week of December.

I tried telling her 'Are you sure? It might ruin your wedding if he comes to know, do you really want it?'

She said 'Dekh bhai, tu toh batayega nahi usse, nor am I gonna say anything, itne saalon mein mummy papa ko nahi pata chala, how'd he figure it?'

I just changed the conversation as it was too much load on my mind... But this thought has been disturbing me, what to do? Also this conversation has ruined my trust on marriage, I don't wanna get married now, this is too fu*ked up and I ain't ready for this, might as well stay single and happy",103,1763779087.0,TwentiesIndia,138,0.91,False

1p3hxjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1p3hxjx/new_job_growing_pains/,New Job Growing Pains.,"Started a new job at a coffee/breakfast place a couple of weeks ago after getting laid off from the fine dining sushi place I had been at for two years (it’s closing down for reconstruction). Before that I was at a more casual sushi spot for a decade where I was also in management towards the last few years of my employment there, but I digress.  

Anywho, after a couple months of searching (I live in a college town and got laid off RIGHT after the college kids came back so the job market was competitive), I found a job at a breakfast joint. It wasn’t my first choice, but I am just grateful I found a job and could finally get off of unemployment. 

This job is different than what I’m used to, that’s for sure. I’m so used to going up to tables, taking an order, and having a computer that prints tickets out to BOH. At this place, you have to write out tickets to give to the BOH but you have to write VERY SPECIFIC abbreviations. No problem, I’ve done that before. But you have to do it in a VERY SPECIFIC way; so gotta get used to that. I’m also used to going around and bussing. Like if you see an empty plate: remove it, if you see a dirty table, wipe it; both immediately so the next party can be sat. That’s usually the cardinal rule. But here, you take an order at the counter, make their coffee drinks and call the drink orders out instead of bringing them to the table, and this is the same with pastries. The only time you deliver food to a table is for entrees.

Being 32 and a student, I’ve noticed how much older I am than my coworkers as well. The FOH girls are all between the ages of 19-23, and it’s becoming clear to me I am not very welcome there as I replaced someone they loved who just quit. A few of them even have a clique-y vibe as well; the other day I was brewing coffee and one of the chamber baskets got stuck. I was struggling to pull it out and two girls who were talking just stared at me after falling silent. When I finally pulled it out, it came out with such force that it struck me in the face and had my nose bleeding everywhere. They saw it all transpire and instead of offering to at least let me go clean myself up, one of them just says, “So ANYWAY….” and they continued their conversation. I went to the back to wipe my face, then one of the girls goes back there telling me to finish my coffee-making task when she literally JUST saw me get domed and had blood going everywhere. 

Sorry, I’m just ranting. Already searching for another job.",15,1763779013.0,TalesFromYourServer,1,0.94,False

1p3hvyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p3hvyi/did_i_cheat/,Did I cheat?,"Hi everyone. I need unbiased advice. My boyfriend thinks I cheated. 

I’ll get straight to the point. About five months ago a guy (let’s call him Z, we were peers in Gr. 5) congratulated me on running for Valedictorian over insta. 

A close girlfriend of mine (let’s call her K) had been talking to me about Z. I vaguely remembered him, never truly interacted before. K was raving to me about how she was convinced he was gay/queer now, after all these years. 

She gave me Z’s profile. I checked it out and honestly, it added up. Made a bunch of stereotypical assumptions based on how decorated his profile was relative to other guys: from painted nails to playing guitar, loving ice cream and such.

It was around 1-2AM when I received Z’s message. I happened to have been awake, so I replied. Our chat was really short, but if I recall correctly it went along the lines of:

Z: omg congrats on running for Valedictorian! Tbh I would vote for you 

Me: thanks! Means a lot to me.

Z: Yeah honestly your application seems slighter more unique compared to K’s. (More fluff/praise here)

(note: K also happened to be running for Val). 

Me: Really? Somehow I hope I get Sal haha, Val is so much pressure 

Z: No you got this !! 

Me: anyways, how are you? It’s been a long time!

Z: I’m goodd. I swear I’ve been so worried about exams and stressed about next year

Me: Omg don’t you’re too sexy to be worried 😍😍

Later on I say something like “wow I like you” in response to something cool Z did/said. Not in a “I’m romantically attracted to you” way. 

The chat wasn’t exactly like that but very similar. The conversation ended three minutes later. I went to sleep. Woke up and forgot about it the next day. 

In retrospect, I escalated WAY too fast, and I was absolutely wrong. Yes I should NOT have 100% assumed he was Gay. No, I absolutely have no romantic intentions or interest or feelings with Z.
Yes, regardless of what I thought/intended, it was completely inappropriate. But cheating? 

I am head over heels for my boyfriend. He is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I made a huge mistake, but it was 2-3 messages. I hate myself for sending them.  My boyfriend has been very clear about trust and loyalty. He has been from the start (we’ve been together for about 11 months). 

I’ve voluntarily let my boyfriend have my Instagram account, location, phone password, and schedule through google calendar. He’s had access since mid summer. 

Three or so months passed and university rolls around. K texts me: “did you know Z is also at your university?” I didn’t, but I check out his profile again and lo and behold. 

I never reach out to him because he’s just that unimportant in my mind.

At some point Z reaches out to me again, asking if I want to meet up with him to get coffee. The conversation went something like:

Z: hey I totally forgot you were at this university until I saw your post. Did you want to meet up and get coffee or something?

Me: Oh haha yeah, sure I’d love to! Do you know of anyone else from Gr. 5 who should come with us? 

(Note; I was WELL aware that a coffee meetup with JUST two people would be weird. I wanted to invite someone else at LEAST.)

Z: yeah I know one guy but I feel like he doesn’t really like me. 

Me: Oh… i can go ask him? 

(Note: my boyfriend and I both know this guy well, let’s call him D)

The conversation ended there as I never followed up. Partially because I didn’t want to. 

Time passes and my boyfriend eventually texts me asking about the message the Z sent me about coffee (again he has access to my DMs). 

I go back to that and I scroll up for more context so I can let him know about who Z is.

I see the old message. My heart drops. 

I immediately tell my boyfriend. He reads them.

Okay now cut scene. 

He gets very upset. I drop everything and drive over — I try to talk and explain but I feel like vomitting and I’m shaking so much because I hate that I hurt him.

His arguments:
- You said that shit while saying you wanted to marry me
- I’ve told you about how I feel about the way you talk to other guys
- Actions speak louder than words. 
- You know how I feel about loyalty. I’ve had to repeat myself so many times. 

CURRENTLY:
Right now he’s giving me a second chance — to prove to him that my words (“I love you”) are real, and that none of what he had was fake. 

I’m so lost right now. We’ve done so much together. I hate that this invalidates everything we’ve shared.

What I’ve done so far to “prove” that I’m fully committed is:
1. Unfollowed all guys and deleted DMs 
2. Deleted Instagram
3. Been sending daily updates/pictures throughout my day and calling around twice a day so he can know I’m not “meeting up” with anyone

I’m so afraid to speak my mind because he said he’s sick of repeating himself. 

I’m so afraid of reasoning: “I don’t think I cheated” because that is exactly what his argument is based off of right now. 

I really don’t want to break up. Please, if anyone has advice. 

I’m trying to change for him. I AM changed. Since that one message five months ago, and as we’ve grown closer as a couple, nothing of the sort has come up. I recognize I’m friendly (or used to be…), but I’d never even consider doing ANYTHING with anyone but him. He is the most loyal, talented, and caring man I’ve ever met. I will honestly do anything. 

I broke his trust. And I deeply regret sending what I sent. I still don’t know why I said what I said to this day.

1p3hvs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1p3hvs0/feeling_kinda_stupid_and_need_to_vent/,Feeling kinda stupid and need to vent,"So I'm sick right now, some kind of cold or flu, hell maybe even COVID who knows.  Doesn't matter really.  But I'm sick and I'm tired, which is just making me emotionally dysregulated and I need to just lay this all out somewhere semi anonymously. 

So I've been doing the streaming thing on Growlr recently, while I'm working or cooking, just sort of a thing to keep me company and I find the guys on Growlr to be friendlier then on any other app.  

So the other day I'm streaming, and this guy pops on my stream.  I say hello, and he just kinda lurks, and says nothing.  But he looks kinda familiar, but I can't place him, because of the way the Growlr Live thing works though, his full picture is cut off.  

So I sent him a quick chat to say hi, said he looked familiar, but couldn't see his full pic on the live.  Mainly so I could go back afterwards and look at his full profile.  

Over ten years ago, I used to chat with this guy who lived in another province from me.  I lived near Toronto at the time.  And we talked a lot, first on the app, then through text and on phone, even FaceTime chat.  We literally talked everyday, often all day every day.  I grew very close to him, and honestly had a massive crush on him.  But I was going through some really heavy treatment/therapy at the time which stopped me from trying to take things further, even to go visit him. Which wouldn't have been hard since I actually have quite a few friends where he lived.  

We chatted for a long time, and then came a time when he was actually going to be in my area, and I thought hey we should go grab coffee or something, since he'd really just be passing through and it would be low pressure. 

He said that he couldn't, he was going to be really busy with family stuff, so it couldn't happen.  I was disappointed but such is life.  

A few days pass, and then when he was actually back home I noticed he has posted how he had a day alone in Toronto while he was waiting for his train, and wish he had something to do, or someone to do it with.  It would have taken me less then an hour to get to downtown Toronto, so the fact that he didn't message me kinda hurt. 

I tried to let it go, because it seemed like a silly thing to be upset about.  He didn't really owe me anything.  But I was still hurt that he didn't contact me, we could have hung out.  

But my feelings were starting to get a bit too big here, not just about how I was hurt, but how I felt about him.  And I needed to talk to him about it, just to clear the air.  So I was honest, direct and mindful about what I said to him, expressing that I had no expectations and that he didn't really owe me anything.  But I needed him to know this, so I could either let it go, so we could remain friends, or take next steps.  And that I was fine with either, but needed to get this out in the open. 

And as someone who told me he always respected honest and direct communication, I figured we could have this conversation. 

I never heard from him again.   And I was pretty angry about that, but again that was his decision and I couldn't force a conversation on him he didn't want to have.  But thought it was pretty shitty of him to just ghost me. 

That is, until he showed up to lurk in my stream this week.  Just enough to remind me he existed and then he didn't say a god damn thing to me.  

And I feel so stupid, because a decade later all those feelings of hurt, anger and abandonment from someone I trusted, someone I actually really cared about.  Despite it just being online.  Just all came flooding back. 
.
I hate the fact that it's over a decade later and he can still evoke those feelings in me.  

I know this will pass, I know it just triggered me and I'm flashbacking to my emotional responses of the time, because I'm vulnerable right now because I'm sick so my emotional regulation is not the best .  Rationally I know this is all long past.  

But emotionally, I'm right in that moment again and it sucks. 

Anyway, not really looking for advice, I just wanted to share.  Hopefully somone can relate.   Hope everyone has a good weekend ",8,1763778865.0,gaybros,1,0.9,False
1p3hvh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jibreal_Khan/comments/1p3hvh1/porn_makes_you_anxious_depressed_here_is_how_to/,Porn makes you ANXIOUS & DEPRESSED… Here is how to fix it.,"# Short term impact - Below Baseline Dopamine

The thing about porn consumption is that: Yes, it does release large quantities of dopamine into your system, and it does make you feel good in the short term. For a brief moment, all your troubles seem to fade away.

However, each time you get this massive hit of dopamine from porn, it is well above your baseline levels of dopamine, and once you are done watching it, your dopamine levels don’t just return back to the baseline again, they actually fall well below baseline level. In short, you feel worse than you felt before you actually indulged in watching porn.

# Long term impact - Desensitization

Additionally, in the long term, the neurological impact of chronic overstimulation is devastating. It leads to reduced activity in the brain's natural reward centers. This creates a state called ""anhedonia,"" where previously enjoyable activities lose their appeal because they can't compete with artificial stimulation levels.

This sort of desensitization effect compounds the problem, requiring even more intense stimulation to achieve the same dopamine response. What began as an occasional session of watching ‘vanilla’ porn for a few minutes, has now evolved into browsing ‘absurd fetishes’ for hours.

# Solution

The good news is that: you can go from a person with a disrupted reward system back to person with a normal healthy reward system. Natural dopamine regulation depends on maintaining appropriate baseline levels whilst preserving the system's ability to respond to genuinely rewarding experiences.

This requires both eliminating artificial overstimulation (in the form of porn, weed, alcohol, fast food etc.) and actively supporting healthy dopamine production and receptor sensitivity through lifestyle interventions. In this post, I am going to discuss a few of these lifestyle interventions that you can start applying to your life and heal your depressed and anxious brain.

# Intervention 1: Get your workouts in.

This intervention is going to sound very cliche, but the truth is that it is incredibly effective and this post would be incomplete without it. This effective protocol is “exercise”. When most people think about exercise, they tend to think about how exercise alters their outwardly appearance: you get leaner, you grow muscles etc. However, there is much more that is happening internally when you exercise. Exercise provides one of the most powerful natural dopamine interventions available.

Moderate aerobic activity, things like going for a slow-paced jog, or cycling at steady pace, or brisk walking, they increase dopamine production for several hours post-exercise, whilst simultaneously improving receptor sensitivity and reducing tolerance to artificial stimulation.

Additionally, High-intensity exercise, such as High Intensity Interval Training or HIIT workouts, have been specifically linked to increases in dopamine receptor density and dopamine transporter function.

What I would recommend is that you create an exercise regimen for yourself that incorporates a bit of both. Slow paced aerobic activities & HIIT, this way you are going to get the best out of both worlds. You can get all these benefits by scheduling 3 - 4 such workouts in a week.

# Intervention 2: Get your sleep in.

This intervention, too, is going to sound quite cliche, yet it is just another very powerful tool to have in your tool kit. This is your “sleep quality”.

Sleep quality has a profound impact on dopamine function, with research showing that optimal sleep can restore dopamine receptor sensitivity by approximately 15-25% overnight. Specifically, studies in animal models demonstrate that sleep deprivation significantly reduces dopamine D1 receptor density by around 15%, while recovery sleep can increase dopamine D2 receptor density by about 25%, indicating receptor sensitivity restoration during sleep.

There are several stages to your sleep. The deep sleep stages facilitate the clearance of metabolic waste products that interfere with neurotransmitter function, whilst REM (Rapid eye movement) sleep consolidates the neural pathways that support healthy reward processing.

There is bunch of other research done on sleep quality and how it impact your memory, your impulse control, your perception of things. Sleep quality, quite literally, plays a major role in every single bodily function that you have. It is absolutely essential for healing your reward system and building the impulse control to overcome porn addiction.

What I would recommend is that, the most important thing you could do to improve your sleep quality is fix a bed time and then go to bed at that same time every single day, including the weekends. There are numerous studies that show irregular sleeping patterns mess up your circadian rhythm, hormone secretion, your mood, your energy levels etc.

My second recommendation for sleep quality would be to get plenty of sunlight especially during the earlier parts of the day. Sunlight exposure, especially in the morning, is strongly associated with improved sleep quality by regulating the body's internal clock (circadian rhythm) and enhancing melatonin and serotonin production. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter that positively affects mood and melatonin is the hormone that induces and maintains sleep at night. Daytime exposure to sunlight also leads you to fall asleep earlier, have longer sleep duration, and better sleep quality compared to minimal sun exposure.

# Intervention 3: Get your cold showers in.

Immersion in cold water (as little as 1–3 minutes) has been shown in studies to elevate dopamine output by up to 250%, with long lasting effects on mood and energy.

Additionally, enhanced alertness and a reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression have been reported following regular cold-water immersion or cold showers. Lastly, cold immersion releases other ""feel-good"" chemicals, such as beta-endorphin and norepinephrine, alongside dopamine, which further contributes to the mental health benefits.

In short, cold showers are like natures antidepressants and they should be part of your routine, especially if you are trying to avoid porn and you are facing void of pleasure in your life. What I would recommend is that you get a total of around 11 minutes per week of deliberate cold exposure, broken into sessions of 1 to 5 minutes each. So, you could be doing like 4 cold showers a week, each of the showers is 3 minutes long and that gives you 12 minutes of cold exposure.

Also, if you are feeling brave ;), I recommend taking the cold shower first thing in the morning. It works better than coffee, in my opinion, and just gets you fired up for the day.

# Intervention 4: Get your meditation in.

Meditation is associated with increased gray matter volume (GMV) in brain regions related to self-awareness, emotional regulation, and reward processing, such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex etc.

Long-term meditation enhances neuroplasticity, which is the brains ability to rewire itself, and this is crucial in restoring your brain back to its factory settings and undoing the damage caused by porn. Additionally, meditation promotes neurogenesis (the creation of new brain cells), particularly in the hippocampus where our memories are stored.

In some sense, meditation is being in the complete opposite state than you are when you watch porn. When you watch porn, you are in a hyper stimulated state. When you meditate, you are deprived off all nearly all stimulation. This is probably why it has such a positive healing effect on your brain. Porn rewires your brain and makes you impulsive and out of control. Whereas meditation rewires you brain and get you feeling like you are in control. Porn erodes gray matter, whereas meditation helps in the creation of new cells.

There are various form of meditation practices that are available, each offer different benefits, what I would recommend is that you start making one of these practices as part of your daily routine. Start with a very little amount, just a couple of minutes and the gradually increase the duration of your practice over time.

However, I recently decided to try streaming PS5 while in my local coffee shop. Chiaki prompted me to sign into my PSN network, which I did. I generated my token, and my PS5 now shows in Chiaki as ""Remote connection via PSN"". No dice. I have tried different wifi networks and still no result.

(21F -> 21M),"TL;DR - Met a great guy through mutuals, my first ""relationship"". He had lots of things I liked, but also things I didn't like. Went on about 5 dates before breaking things off due to something health-related + being on different timelines. He thought I was ""the one"", ""perfect"" and hasn't been able to move on for 7 months since. He brought me generous gifts early on as well - which I wasn't comfortable with (prefer small meaningful actions but obviously he didn't know ME at the time). Mutuals constantly tell me how great/sincere he is - making me SO confused about letting him go (for now - I don't want to date for a few years) vs feeling I was being love bombed/projected onto. Thoughts????!!!!



So earlier this year, I met a boy at a mutual friend's 21st. He was tall, decent-looking and a good conversationalist. We hit it off and pretty much got talking right away! First coffee ""date"" went okay from my perspective, but amazing according to him. I led most of the conversation - and while we had lots in common, I wasn't 100% feeling the chemistry.

He asked to see me again every week consistently after that, and I went with it because there were lots of things I liked about him - he was kind, respectful and had great family values + similar hobbies. Our mutual friends also spoke very highly of him e.g. the girls went to him for guy advice. Friends opinions definitely kept me hooked, despite not being completely sure. The things I didn't like? He often lacked confidence and had some people-pleasing tendencies, also, his method of planning dates was just whatever he THOUGHT I would like.

Fast forward a few dates, he tells me about a health-related issue. I freaked out since I'm a med student and I asked for a break to think. At the time, I was super busy in school (6-year degree), while he had graduated and was looking for roles in IT/tech. So I told him it was probably best to take an undefined pause/break things off there. I was honest - different career trajectories/timelines, needing to accept the health thing. I told him I wanted to intentionally stay single until I finished school and stable in my job. We agreed to trying friendship later.

Kicker? He told me he thought I was ""perfect"", that he wouldn't find anyone else like me. He told our mutuals that evening he thought I was ""the one"". This was crazy to me because it had just been 2 months and 5 dates!!! We went no contact but kept following each other - and he would continue to like my stories (""friends"" right).

Anyway, he suddenly unfollowed me recently, and our mutual told me he hadn't been able to move on. He kept thinking about me daily for the 7 months that passed!!! He also apparently brought me an expensive gift right after our 2nd date as a birthday surprise (my birthday wasn't for another 10 months lol)????

My intuition told me that he didn't know or like ME, rather he was just projecting his ""perfect"" person onto me. But my friend reassured me that he is a great and genuine guy, it was truly from his heart. UGH I'm so CONFUSED.

Did I screw up by letting such a good guy go??? When I'm finally ready to date/settle down am I going to regret this choice?",0,1763778595.0,AITAH,3,0.5,False
1p3hsd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1p3hsd4/1_year_married_resentful_about_cleaning/,"1 Year Married, Resentful About Cleaning","EDIT: I re-read this and can’t change the title, but this is more about cleaning. It’s more resentment about my husband’s inactivity with household tasks like cooking, future planning, and cleaning.

My husband and I just celebrated our one year wedding anniversary. He loves me and treats me well. I love him, but I also need to find more constructive ways to communicate my needs to him regarding division of household labor.

Some cases:

\- He recently came home from a conference trip and unpacked his bags (great!). However, the dirty laundry he washed from the conference trip is still sitting in the dryer 3 days later.

\- Not cleaning related, but when he asked me what I wanted for my birthday in September, I said a camping trip. Doesn’t have to be a whole national park thing - just a nice weekend trip in a local park would do. Camping and getting outside are very important to me and will be a cemented family value when we have kids. He brought me out to eat for my birthday and got me gifts. Honestly I don’t even remember what we did, but I’m sure it was lovely. However, I’m still reminding him 2 months later that I want to go camping. I don’t want to plan my own birthday camping trip.

\- He is spending more than he brings in. OK… I understand that spousal incomes are joint income. We’re in a great financial position because we live in a house that his parents bought him, so no mortgage payments, and I make over $170k/year. But he makes \~$35k/year. He has a JD that he could put to use, but decided before he met me to get a PhD in a niche subject that likely won’t lead to a professorship job, especially one that we’ll move for him to pursue. If he wants the PhD for the PhD, fine. But I need a more concrete timeline on when he’ll be done rather than his vague “I’m trying to be done by next year,” while we’re currently trying for a baby and need to save for our future family. He also needs to make his deadlines - he submitted his qualitative exams a week late and continually misses deadlines. It pisses me off. I don’t want the added pressure of an additional baby human on my payroll, the extra cleaning, and having to pay for cleaning people when we could just knock our the household tasks together.

\- HIs parents set us up for a 15-minute one-on-one with their financial advisor over a year ago. After outlining out finances to her, she said she would be happy to meet with us using the retainer she has under his parents. Music to my ears. Since she is my in-laws’ financial advisor, I asked him to set up that follow-up meeting series with her. I actually asked him four or five times. We have yet to meet with her again because he never got in touch.

\- He never initiates meals. He’ll often make coffee in the mornings, but will never think ahead or propose what we should make for dinner. If, on the off chance, he does cook, it’s the same thing every time: a veggie fried rice thing I made once that he decided to replicate again and again and again and again… I’m so bored of it. I love cooking new things, especially with my partner, but I haven’t been motivated lately because of what I’m perceiving as a relationship imbalance and working long hours in a challenging leadership position.

\- I have high standards for household cleanliness. I like the kitchen counters wiped down every day, the house vacuumed 3-4x/week (we have two pets and shedding can pile up), and the bathroom scrubbed once a week, so I don’t feel slimy grime under my feet when I step into the shower after a long day of work (I usually work 9-10 hour days). When I moved into his house, it was a total bachelor pad. It’s starting to feel like a home - friends and family have even commented on the different - and now we’re dealing with the challenges of balancing everyday maintenance between the two of us.

\- Don’t even get me started on the dusting. This man has more books than god and is dead set on displaying them on our open shelving in the living room. I’m the only one who dusts those shelves. When I met him and started staying over, I noticed the shelves had a few centimeters of dust buildup on them.

He can handle little one-off tasks here and there, but it feels like he can’t get anything past the finish line on a regular basis. Again, we’re trying for a baby -- instead of feeling safe and secure about starting a family, I’m anxious. On top of it all, he tells me he cleans and that I don’t notice it… This drives me nuts, breeds resentment, and makes me explode on him in toxic ways. I’ve tried to suggest cleaning sessions where we do it together a couple of times a week, but he isn’t interested in cleaning together. We’re also only sleeping together when I’m ovulating - the attraction has plummeted.

That’s a lot of venting, but I would welcome any feedback or advice. My job offers couples counseling for free and I’m tempted to sign us up, but then there I'll be again… doing the most while he’s along for the ride.

1p3hrj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1p3hrj6/queerphobia_in_the_dress_code/,Queerphobia in the Dress Code,"Are there any other LGBTQIA+ partners who can't help but sense targeted hostility within the dress code? I can't escape this suspicion that a large part of why it was implemented was to sanitise our appearances not just by severely limiting our ability to express ourselves, but also by curtailing our ability to denote queer identities through our clothing. I really think they want to limit our visibility under the guise of ""professionalism.""

There's a stereotype/joke/meme that the quality of your Starbucks drink is directly proportional to the visible queerness of the barista, and I feel like that's something they're trying to fight with the Back To Starbucks plan. As a transgender man with similarly queer friends, we always viewed Starbucks as safe spots because of their policies and because there were so many employees like us who seemed comfortable in the environment the company created-- so much so that when we needed to travel, we would plan our routes by Starbucks locations because we knew we could stop there with minimal risk of harassment or assault. The representation mattered to us, particularly living in the Bible Belt where we don't get to let down our guard.

Now, as a partner, I go to my store with my similarly queer coworkers, where we all have to dress like we sling coffee aboard the Death Star or be sent home in humiliation. I have directly observed the dress code being disproportionately applied to queer and especially trans partners as opposed to cishet counterparts (for example, a cis woman being allowed to wear metallic hair tinsel and perfume, but a trans man being sent home because his pants were the wrong shade of khaki, or another trans man being told to remove his metal hair clip), and I feel disempowered to speak against it because, of course, they're just enforcing the rules. Initially, I thought it was specific to my store's management, but I feel like it would be foolish to assume that the code was not being exercised the same way in other stores.

Has this been anyone else's experience? Am I being paranoid, or is anyone else picking up the same impression? ",0,1763778517.0,starbucks,25,0.39,False

Ok so I'm a graduate school student coming out of a semi-target university doing an MSc in Management focusing on Finance. Growing up I was a nasty fucking kid, like really awful wanted to party get drunk and smoke a shit tone of weed. Due to my family's background, not super wealthy or anything, but nice solid middle to upper middle class, I was made to attend college, and by some miracle I did super well. finished top of my class and grinded my ass off. During college i changed a lot, stopped hanging around the high school crowd that loved the so called good life and surrounded myself with people that valued education. Opted to pretty much stick with the group of friends that ""had a future"". I should add that I did not incur any debt, as both my parents paid my tuition. I did manage to secure a first placement at a big bank, working as an analyst, even before finishing undergrad. But before even finishing, I knew I wanted to attend graduate school, seeing all my buddies going down the same path. The placement at the Bank ended up going pretty well, I got an offer after 6 months but decided not to take it... had my sights deadset on grad school. Got into a pretty decent grad school, got my grades all god, miraculously did not fail any classes. I tried my hardest, really tried hard networking, saw some grad school buddies getting offers from big banks and top consulting companies. Had some grueling interviews, talking like 4 to 5 rounds, but so far unlucky. Knew some people who failed like 2 to 3 courses and had secured pretty freaking awesome positions but not me. The problem now arises, I failed getting an internship and I've been home for the last 4 months, because in all my infinite wisdom, I decided to take an academic break in this first semester. Before embarking on this my mom and dad told me that I would have grad school paid for. It was a pretty tacit verbal agreement, but now i feel the rug being proverbially pulled right beneath my feet. My mom decided to, and if I may be a little humorous, pull my financing. I was told I was ""Doing absolutely nothing for my future"". Meanwhile I've been sending around 1 to 2 CVs daily, but I kid you not, the call-backs for interviews have stopped since late September (those of you in the know of graduate employment schemes will understand). I was told I had to find a job and write my thesis. The thing is I'm not an executive Master's or an MBA student, so my university will NOT accommodate this. I'm pretty much stuck with dissertation seminars during business hours. To add to the clusterfuck, the guidelines for the dissertation semester prep seminar advised a total of 35 to 40 weekly hours devoted to writing the dissertation. Ive tried telling my mom that the landscape is harsh, right now getting a solid graduate position is tough as shit, but she won't have it. Got around 3,2k saved, and have 4k left to pay. I'm obviously not getting an internship now with the start of the next semester around the corner. I would have around 1K after all is said and done after going halfsies with my dad, but I feel like I'm at a point of no return with my mom. what would you guys do ? know I'm pretty fucking privileged and this really is a non-issue when compared to other folks' problems, but honestly what would you do? The way u see it I could, get a less demanding part-time gig, like restocking at a local grocery or at a coffee shop. Should I say fuck my savings and just keep grinding and do the dissertation full-time? I would say that my mom pretty much despises me, and sees me as a slouch that only aims to be a NEET, so talking to her could be a possibility, just not a very reliable one... 



Again pretty privileged problem to have, but any inputs would be nice, I fucking just hate my predicament... I feel that I worked my ass off just to be in a clusterfuck of a situation. 



***TLDR***: An MSc Finance student is struggling to land a job in a tough market. Despite a verbal agreement to pay for school, his mother has cut off funding for his final dissertation semester because she perceives him as lazy for not having secured a position yet.

1p3hp4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1p3hp4v/we_finally_trusted_someone_to_watch_our_disabled/,"We finally trusted someone to watch our disabled daughter, and it turned into a nightmare","After our 7-week-old daughter finally stabilized from a horrible medical crisis that kept her in the pediatric intensive care unit for weeks, resulting in cerebral palsy, we were finally sent home. We didn’t dare let our baby out of our sight. We were terrified of her seizing or choking or not breathing again, we were constantly monitoring her. My wife Sally and I were already exhausted from the hospital experience; physically, emotionally and spiritually. Now, our hyper-vigilance was taking an intense toll on us.

Our family and friends could see that were not doing well, we were worn out and needed some respite. They all did the best they could, but caring for her could be a monumental task. So, after much persuading, we finally agreed to get some professional help.

Because of our daughter’s newly inflicted disability and our low income, Sally and I qualified for state sponsored respite care. This meant that we could have somebody from a state qualified agency, trained in caretaking and emergency medical procedures, take care of our baby girl for little to nothing, for about 20 hours a month.

When our first respite day came, we were beyond nervous. The thought of leaving her alone with somebody else, was overwhelming. Sally and I decided that there was no way we could be far away from our daughter, at least not on this first respite visit. So, we decided to just walk around the block several times, which was as far as we felt we could be from our child.

The respite caretaker arrived on time. She was a very large, rosy-cheeked lady. She seemed nice enough and sounded as if she knew what she was doing.

We talked with her for about 15 minutes, explaining everything she needed to know for the care of our daughter. Then, Sally handed the caretaker a baby sling to carry her around the house. At the time, it was the ultimate tool to keep our child comfortable and reduce her constant screaming. Sally asked the respite care lady if she knew how to use it, she said yes, and ushered us out the door.

Sally and I walked around the block several times, holding hands, occasionally sitting on the curb and talking. It was nice to get out, alone and be tender with each other. The sun was setting, the temperature was nice and cool, and this alone time was just what we needed. It was the first time in a while that we’d been outside, just the two of us, and I felt almost human again.

After about 30 minutes, we decided we’d been gone long enough. I was feeling a sense of rejuvenation, like the dark cloud had been lifted, even if just a bit, and I could handle another day of our new, complicated life.

As we got back home and walked in the front door, that nice feeling evaporated, instantaneously.

There, standing in our living room was the respite caretaker, her face was red, wet with sweat. I stood there staring at her, trying to figure out what the hell was going on. Then I saw our daughter, or rather, I saw our daughter’s foot. It was sticking up from the top of the sling. The respite care provider had put our child into the sling upside down. After a moment, as I stood there dumbfounded, I could hear her muffled screams coming from inside of the sling.

Sally was the first to react. She ran over, pulled our baby girl out of the sling, feet first, and quickly rushed our baby away from the respite caretaker. Sally sat down, took her onesie off to cool her down. She was discolored and sweaty, from a lack of oxygen and the heat. God knows how long this lady had our baby stuffed ass-backwards into the sling. The caretaker was clearly flustered, became defensive, and blamed everything on the cloth device, rather than her lack of common sense.

Without saying a word to each other, Sally and I both knew that we wanted this human train wreck out of our home and lives, forever, as quickly as possible. Sally handed our child to me and rushed into our bedroom to get the checkbook. When Sally came back, she had the check filled out, with a generous tip included.

I felt a massive sense of relief when my wife handed this woman her pay, so she could get the hell out of our home and lives. But to my surprise, she didn’t get up off the couch. She leaned back, put one leg over the other, and started watching TV! Sally and I stood there flabbergasted, almost as if we had been transported into an episode of The Twilight Zone.

We all sat there for a few moments in silence, Sally and I nervously shifting our gaze from the TV to the lady, and back to the TV. Eventually, Sally got up, walked halfway to the front door and said, “Well, thanks for the help, we really appreciate it, I think we are going to rest now.” The respite caretaker slowly turned her gaze from the TV to Sally, with a surprised look on her face and said, “You’re supposed to feed me. I’m hungry, so you need to feed me before I go, it’s in the agreement.”

You could have heard a pin drop in my living room. The caretaker sat there intently staring at Sally, Sally stood there looking back at her, not saying a word, trying to absorb what this woman had just told her. I wanted to crawl under the coffee table with the baby, insert my thumb into my mouth, and curl up in the fetal position.

There was no agreement to feed anybody, none whatsoever. This lady just wanted to eat.

So, there we sat, Sally on a hard wooden rocking chair, cradling our child in her arms, me perched on a hand-me-down seat, while the caretaker lounged on our soft couch. She was slowly, and loudly, eating a hastily-put-together meal, on a TV tray, watching a sitcom, occasionally laughing. She was oblivious to our presence, much less, her impact on us. As I watched this oversized woman, all I could think about was [Mr. Creosote](https://youtu.be/rXH_12QWWg8) from the Monty Python movie “The Meaning of Life”.

In the scene, Mr. Creosote eats so much, he projectile vomits into a bucket, eats more, and finally explodes, after eating one last wafer. As I sat there waiting for this lady to explode, I had a sinking feeling as I realized that it would be a very-very-very long time, before either my wife or I could trust anybody again, to take care of our little angel.",0,1763778315.0,TrueOffMyChest,22,0.39,False

Conner and I have been friends for about a year and a half since he started working at my job. Conner is a genuinely cool person, and I enjoy his company. He's funny, smart, and we get along really well. Connor also has autism, and a few other medical issues that are worth noting. Connor owns a house, and with both of us working near minimum-wage jobs, most, if not all, of his money goes towards his mortgage, bills, etc. When our friend group wants to hang out outside of just going to someone's house, one of us will usually offer to help pay for him to go because we want him to be able to come with us. He has once or twice paid for one of us for something or other, like a dinner, etc. Connor also doesn't drive, so I sometimes drive him to work when I'm also working, or drive him home. I don't mind driving him, and often offer rides to my friends who don't have a car, can't drive, etc, to save money. Another friend of ours, Jake, lives in the direction I'm going anyway, so to pick him up really isn't that big of a deal.

I first noticed it one day when Conner was working a double-shift, and asked if I could bring him some coffee after I got off work. It was no issue for me, since the coffee shop was not even half a mile down the road. I got the coffee and brought it to him, he said thanks, and left. Another time, I got up early to bring him to work, I was only coming in an hour or two later, and figured I could take myself to breakfast. Conner asked what I would do with these two hours, and I told him. He asked if I would bring him some, and I told him I would, but again, after bringing him food, he didn't ask what it cost or offer to pay. Just recently, Jake and I were going over to Conners house, and Jake was taking me to go get food before we went over because I was starving after work. While we were discussing plans over the phone, Jake mentioned to Conner that we were picking me up some food and would then be over to his house. Conner asked if we could grab him some food too, and since I was already going, I agreed, feeling it would be rude not to bring him some since I was already going to that restaurant. But again, Conner never offered to pay me back. 

Jake and I have been talking, and Conner has done this a lot lately. Just recently, his partner spent a couple grand on a personal hobby, and they both went out to dinner together. In talking to Jake, I learned that Conner actually owes him a good chunk of change from helping him to pay for a couple of bills when he was in a bind. We're both kind of irritated, and Jake has confessed that while he loves Conner and loves hanging out with him, he's burnt out from still not being paid back. I kinda feel the same way. I want to bring this up to Conner, but I'm worried he won't take it well. Recently, his medical issues have been really bothering him, and he hasn't been in the greatest of moods. At work, he's irritable, and seems to be slowing down, which is understandable. But when Jake and even our boss brought it up to him, Conner has gotten really defensive, and I'm worried that if I bring up my struggles with him not offering to pay me back, he might not take it well. 

I genuinely value Conner as a friend, and don't want to stress him out even more with everything going on, but I'm struggling with feeling taken advantage of. I want to have an adult conversation with him, but I have no idea how to approach him about it. It's gotten to the point where Jake is struggling with wanting to spend time with him, because he's still not being paid back, and Conner has been talking about how 'mean' Jake has been recently. I want to stay friends, and hate saying no, especially if it's not really an issue picking him up some food, but we both work at the same job, and I don't have a lot of money either.

In classrooms, job interviews, social media, there's this pressure to never mess up, never show weakness, always be in control. But here's the wild part: trying to act flawless actually makes people like you *less*. What makes you more appealing? Surprisingly, it's showing just the right kind of flaw.

This post digs into one of the weirdest and most useful psychological effects you’ve probably never used to your advantage: the **Pratfall Effect**. The idea comes from real research, not some recycled TikTok advice. It’s backed by science, explained in books like *“Thinking, Fast and Slow”* by Daniel Kahneman and explored by top behavioral scientists like Dr. Elliot Aronson, who first discovered it.

Why this matters? Because being respected *and* relatable is a power combo. And we’re usually taught to pick one. But when used right, showing small imperfections can *raise* your status rather than ruin it.

Here’s how to make the Pratfall Effect work in real life, backed by science, podcasts, and the best psychological insights out there:

* **What is the Pratfall Effect exactly?**
  * Basically, the Pratfall Effect says that highly competent people become more likable when they make a small, harmless mistake.
  * This was discovered in a 1966 study by psychologist **Elliot Aronson**, where participants listened to recordings of people answering quiz questions. The ones who performed well but spilled coffee at the end were rated *more likable* than those who were competent but didn’t mess up.
  * But here's the key: it only works if people *already* think you're competent. If you screw up *without* proving you're capable first, it just confirms you're a mess.

* **Why does it work?**
  * People like humans, not robots. When you're really good at something but also show a flaw, it makes you feel “real” to others.
  * According to a meta-analysis published in the *Journal of Nonverbal Behavior* (2019), small admissions of harmless vulnerability increase trust and warmth in professional and social dynamics.
  * Think of it like smoothing off the sharp edges of perfection. It invites connection without threatening status.

* **How to use the Pratfall Effect without looking sloppy**
  * *Make the mistake small and harmless.* Forgetting a name, laughing at yourself, sharing a minor failure, not your biggest trauma or a career-ending error.
  * *Lead with competence.* Deliver great work, show your knowledge, or demonstrate skill *before* revealing the flaw.
  * *Use it strategically.* In job interviews, public talks, or team leadership moments, owning a minor stumble can make you more trustworthy. For example:
    * “Sorry, I get way too excited about spreadsheets. Yep, that’s my embarrassing confession of the week.”
    * “Of course I forgot my keys in a podcast studio… right after explaining my ‘morning routine mastery.’ Classic.”
    
* **Places where it’s working already (you just didn’t realize)**
  * **Podcast hosts** like Tim Ferriss, who often highlight their early failures while interviewing billionaires.
  * YouTubers like **Ali Abdaal** or **Thomas Frank** routinely share productivity fails to connect with their audience.
  * Even in politics, candidates gain points when they show awkwardness *after* proving they know what they’re doing. Obama’s self-deprecating humor? Peak Pratfall Effect.

* **Use it in personal life, too**
  * *Dating?* People are more attracted to someone who shows just a bit of authentic vulnerability. Not perfect, just real.
  * *Friendships?* Sharing mini failures (like messing up sourdough again) makes you more relatable and safe to open up to.
  * *Confidence building?* Once you learn that perfection isn’t the goal, your social anxiety drops fast. You stop trying to script every moment.

* **What NOT to do**
  * Don’t overshare or trauma dump. The Pratfall Effect is not the Sympathy Effect.
  * Don’t expose major incompetence. Do not use this trick if you haven’t proven your skill/value first.
  * Don’t fake it. People can smell a rehearsed vulnerability from a mile away.

* **Bonus insights from the experts**
  * In *“The Human Brand”* by Chris Malone and Susan Fiske (professor at Princeton), they found that brands and people that show both **warmth and competence** build the deepest loyalty. Overemphasizing just competence makes others feel threatened.
  * A 2022 study in *Harvard Business Review* found that leaders who occasionally admit mistakes in meetings retain higher trust and increase team performance by up to 19%.
  * The *Hidden Brain* podcast’s episode “You 2.0: Being Kind to Yourself” dives into why self-compassion and light vulnerability actually help people grow faster, not slower.

* **How to practice this in daily life**
  * Try adding a small, real self-own in the next group setting *after* you’ve offered value.
  * In your email signature or bio, include something slightly silly or unexpected, it signals confidence without arrogance.
  * When someone gives you a compliment, acknowledge it but add a little genuine imperfection: “Thanks! Though it took me three tries to get it right…”

Once you internalize this, something clicks. You stop trying to be the person who never messes up. You focus on being the person who’s *good and human*. You’re sharp, but soft around the edges. Turns out, that’s what makes people trust you more.

1p3hnfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p3hnfk/the_aftermath_of_dating_a_loser/,The aftermath of dating a loser,"I don’t hear about this enough but the aftermath of dating a loser is truly an interesting journey. For me, my self esteem was shattered after breaking things off with somebody who couldn’t even express true love. I felt like I was completely unloveable and not worthy of a relationship. It didn’t help that he was my first boyfriend.

For months, I was waiting for him to reach out, to finally take accountability. Maybe even catch up over coffee. But I knew him. He loved playing the victim in every single incident of his life — he could never do no wrong. And even if he did realize his wrongdoings, he will never openly admit it. I honestly like to say his ego got in the way of us having a fulfilling relationship. Yet, I still had hope he changed.

As for him being a “loser”. He wanted the easy route in everything he did. He cheated on almost every assignment all the way through graduation. He was 23 and hardly worked any jobs despite having plenty of free time. His parents gave him an allowance. We literally had to organize our dates or simple plans around the date of his “payday” but even then, he wasted his money on the dumbest things oh my goodness. There’s so much more but it’s laughable looking back. 

I was considering following him on instagram earlier this week because his friend follows me (I only accepted because I actually enjoyed the time I spent getting to know her) so I would not be surprised if he’s already up to date on my life. He requested to follow back in September a couple days after his friend did after I removed him in July but I declined because I thought it was such a pussy move. But then I got really sick recently and got flashbacks to when I was even more sick in the spring where he showed absolutely no concern whatsoever until I told him to. He was even aggressive when we were intimate around that time, knowing my body couldn’t handle it. That was honestly my second to final straw. I brought up his lack of concern during the breakup and even then, he still didn’t get my frustration. He deflected like his life depended on it. I just wanted him to actually show that he “loved” me. 

Now, I know I’m genuinely better off without ever seeing him again, truly. This isn’t relevant and might come off as conceited but I don’t think he could do better than me, at least while he’s still this way. He’s attracted to drama and chaos, from what I’ve learned about his lengthy past. He doesn’t take time to heal — he finds the next girl to occupy his time. I like to say dating is his favorite hobby. He will never admit it but he doesn’t respect himself. And I know I deserve so much better and I mean it. It’s been 5 months and my confidence has never been better. I’m single and relearning how to love being alone and it’s been amazing. I have a much better understanding of what I like and don’t like and that doesn’t just apply to dating but hobbies as well. I have a clearer view of what career path I want to take. I never imagined being this content with silence.

TL;DR: Breaking up with my ex was the best thing I’ve ever done and I’m grateful for dating a loser because now I think I’m the shit. And please do not follow your ex on social media or break no contact, it’s not worth it.",3,1763778169.0,BreakUps,0,0.81,False

1p3hm3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/deardiary/comments/1p3hm3w/20251121_found_a_new_tv_show/,2025/11/21 found a new tv show,"it's a family new year's tradition to watch horror movies and for most years, the screening of these movies has been up to me.  i still like horror movies, but for a long time, horror was almost exclusively my genre.  books, movies, video games, anything.  every now and then, i still sometimes find it soothing somehow.  over the years, there are still a few movies and books that have stuck with me.  one of these movies was '[creep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1FmJHhWm8A)'.  i know there was also a 'creep 2' which i never saw.  it was probably good because it has the same actor from the first one and he's really what made the first one.  i found today that there's even a 'creep' tv series now and watched the first three episodes.

again, the same actor, and wow.  they were great.  really true to the first movie.  what he captures so well is how, i would imagine, when you're going to kill someone face to face... you'd have to bridge that gap between 'this is a normal human interaction' and 'no, seriously, i'm right now about to kill you'.  it would be a surreal moment and i'm not sure the victim would even really take it seriously, unless you'd already been violent with them and they understood what was happening and what they knew you were already capable of.

i love that they have these moments, where the killer is clearly, straightforwardly telling his victim 'i'm about to kill you' and they don't take it seriously.  i love that there's no violence leading up to it, but instead the killer has been fucking with them psychologically and confusing them about whether or not he's dangerous, so even when he's saying it straight up, swinging the axe, they're still not fighting back or running until the actual moment that they're physically begin killed by him.  i think it's just a really original approach to a murder scene.

it's almost like how some predatory animals are said to hypnotize their prey, like 'kaa' from the jungle book.  i think the prey must just sort of be like 'what?' just unable to imagine what's about to happen when there's been no chase or violence already.  predatory animals are really messed up, they have disturbing psychology.  they *like* to terrorize, they *like* to play.  they're sadistic little fucks.  there are cases where, and it's usually a big cat, an animal will become a man-eater and terrorize people because it's fun.  there was this lion (not the man-eating lions of tsavo) that terrorized a village, killed a woman and then took her stuff out of her house and played with it.  it sent messages to other villagers like 'i know where you live' basically, and then became a ghost.

anyway, i was enjoying that tv show and relaxing around the house and ate kind of whatever i wanted today.  [breakfast](https://imgur.com/G5oB1z3) was eggs, toast, [cereal](https://imgur.com/A9rNvG6), coffee.  watching my show, i had [cheezies](https://imgur.com/3rr2VUu) from halloween and then [more](https://imgur.com/Bn3uyA2).  feels ridiculous eating all these little bags.  i also had some [nice cream](https://imgur.com/y5OMxYX) which is just frozen bananas blended with cocoa powder and some peanut butter on top (bonus points for sugar cone).  [dinner](https://imgur.com/aGm1QMH) was roasted vegetables and hummus and a flatbread with other roasted vegetables and salsa.  i wouldn't say i've 'blown it' but this is just a hungry day for me and i might still eat a bit more.",1,1763778056.0,deardiary,0,1.0,False

Hybrid sibo, which i fed and bred. Myself. 

It's a result of gluttony and a lack of discipline.  

Cure is here ^ 

Stay hungry. See more. Understand. 

It's 3 months of dietary discipline and work. And then bread and milk is back on the menu. 

Gastritis.  

Rice, broccoli and chicken. 

We've gone to deep. Don't get me wrong. I need to understand how things are working as well. But consider We've missed something. 

We all know carbs make things brighter. 

Science speaks otherwise. So does abstinence from carbs and fiber, the shared experience of many people. 

Fodmaps. 

It's just 2 different states. Schools? 

Both are viable for healing ( ofc if not sifo, but hey.. turns out shrooms are outed out really quick. That's why bacteria flourishes. ) 

It's discipline in food intake and the kind of food taken in. 

Antimicrobials are helpful at specifically correct time. With binders, preferably. 

Prokinetics yes - but don't forget it can ricochet backwards. Pvc, anxiety, panic attacks, inability to sleep. Triggered. 

Pelvis. Oh God. 

Breathing? Don't get locked in. Relax. The pelvis. 

Belly touch. Warm. Direct stimulation. 

NO CAFFEINE. STRICTLY NONE AND NO DECAF. OR TEA. ---> major trigger through pelvic floor tension, cortisol up, sleep / cyrcadian rhytm fallout, ^ gastric acid [ might be okay with low acid. But gpt says bad. ] and a lot of other things ( mildly acidic > irritates, shakes dopamine etc ] 

I'm a barista of 14 years and a caffeine addict of 27( I'm 33 )


This very thing was found to be the one biggest disturber of all that prevented recovery. 

Triggers - okay
 Live with em, until it goes away

How do you make it go away? 

Slowly, disciplined, treating yourself. 

Planned meals, thoughtfully cooked. Snack plans. 
All cooking done with gpt + monash. Yeast was a mistake at monash, which I took for way too long into carnivore and found out same time I dropped coffee. There was nothing else to drop. 

So, yeah. I hope this helps someone
Please reach out as I'm personally looking for help to start a fresh cycle and get back into keto and no carb. Not even for recovery. I will eat taters and whatever rice or other noice carbs when the time is right. But I'd really like to invite someone into a little more strict dietary plan and ease into ketosis, while prepping for deep autophagy and full recovery within weeks. 

I've got the plan and we can work on something more structured and common together.
