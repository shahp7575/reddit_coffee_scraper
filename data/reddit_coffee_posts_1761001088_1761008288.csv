About a month ago, I started a dairy-free diet to help with acne. I used to have whole wheat bread with jam and whole milk in my coffee, but I switched to sourdough bread (still with jam) and almond milk instead.

The good news: my skin has improved drastically, way less oily, and no new acne. The bad news: I‚Äôve been having upper abdominal pain right under my ribs. It got so bad one night that I actually threw up.

I‚Äôve had blood work and an ultrasound, and both came back normal. I took omeprazole (an antacid) for a few days, and the pain went away but now that I‚Äôve stopped it, the pain seems to be slowly coming back.

I‚Äôm wondering if the diet change itself (cutting dairy and eating sourdough instead of my usual bread) could be upsetting my stomach maybe because of the sourdough‚Äôs acidity or the sudden change in foods?

Has anyone else experienced something similar after going dairy-free or changing breads? Should I go back to my old diet for a few days to see if it helps, or just wait and let my gut adjust?

I moved to Canberra not long ago and honestly‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm struggling to get my head around how this city was built. Everyone calls it the ‚ÄúBush Capital,‚Äù which sounds nice ‚Äî trees, hills, clean air, all that. But living here day to day feels off. It‚Äôs like someone tried to design a city without ever actually living in one.

Everything looks tidy from above ‚Äî roundabouts, green belts, symmetry ‚Äî but when you‚Äôre on the ground, it‚Äôs just empty. There‚Äôs barely anyone walking. You can go for a half-hour walk and maybe see two people, both with dogs. It feels more like an overgrown suburb than a capital city.

My commute from my place to uni sums it up: 17 minutes by car, 51 by bike, and over an hour by public transport. How is that even possible? Public transport here feels like a side project, not a real system. And biking? Half the time people are riding on roads that look like motorways. It‚Äôs nuts.

Then there‚Äôs housing ‚Äî I keep seeing listings that say ‚Äú1 bedroom, 2 car spaces‚Äù like that‚Äôs a selling point. Everything is designed around the assumption that you drive everywhere. It‚Äôs wild. I came from a place where you can walk to the shop, grab a coffee, see people on the street ‚Äî here, everything is behind a wheel.

Canberra honestly feels like it copied the worst bits of American urban planning ‚Äî endless sprawl, cul-de-sacs, giant parking lots, ‚Äútown centres‚Äù that are just a Woolies, a chemist, and a pub surrounded by asphalt. Belconnen, Woden, Tuggeranong‚Ä¶ they all feel like copy-paste commercial zones dropped in the middle of nowhere.

It‚Äôs beautiful in theory ‚Äî the trees, the lakes, the open space ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt feel alive. It‚Äôs like it was designed to be looked at, not lived in. The vibe is more ‚Äúgovernment experiment‚Äù than ‚Äúcommunity.‚Äù

And the weirdest part? We‚Äôre sitting right between Sydney and Melbourne, and there‚Äôs still no high-speed rail. Like seriously ‚Äî it‚Äôs 2025. Japan‚Äôs had bullet trains since the 1960s. China has thousands of kilometres of HSR. Even freakin‚Äô Turkey has it. Meanwhile, here we are driving or flying between cities that are a few hours apart.

Every few years someone brings up a Sydney‚ÄìCanberra‚ÄìMelbourne HSR project, there‚Äôs another ‚Äústudy,‚Äù and then it just disappears again. How has it not happened yet? Canberra would literally be perfect for it.

Anyway, sorry for the rant ‚Äî I just needed to get this out. Does anyone else find it kind of depressing how everything is so spread out and car-dependent?
Are there any parts of Canberra that actually feel like a proper, walkable neighbourhood? Or is this just how it is here and everyone‚Äôs made peace with it?

And real talk ‚Äî does anyone actually believe we‚Äôll see high-speed rail in our lifetime, or is that just one of those ideas everyone quietly gave up on?

1obyxyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1obyxyy/i_need_to_have_a_serious_conversation_with_my/,I need to have a serious conversation with my husband about being more thoughtful/considerate,"TLDR husband is very inconsiderate and does not make me feel seen or loved with his actions. I need advice on how exactly to emphasize to him how serious this issue is for me and how I can‚Äôt feel like this forever. 


i feel like it comes very naturally to me to think of my husband throughout the day, and it's hardly any effort for me to do things that make his life easier. he works full time, i'm a stay at home mom to our toddler. he often uses being tired from work as an excuse for being inconsiderate/forgetful, and while sometimes i can excuse certain things, i don't think working full time should keep you from thinking of your spouse. in fact, he often does things that just gives me more work to do (like cleaning up his messes). when i worked full time when we were dating, i did small gestures for him almost everyday. surprise him with coffee, flowers, a small gift i found when i was out and about, and more.

in the beginning of our relationship we discussed love languages. his is words of affirmation, and i follow through on that multiple times a day, every day. always have. i remind him how much i love him, how good of a father he is, etc. mine would be acts of service. that doesn't mean waiting on me hand and foot, it means doing small gestures/tasks to show me you thought of me. it could be as small as making me a cup of coffee, offering to do a chore i normally have the responsibility of doing, making meal i love, etc. he doesn't do any of that. ever. i do not feel thought of by him.

i'm the cook of the house, which is honestly fine with me 99% of the time. but i have communicated multiple times now that it would be nice if on his days off, he occasionally offered to make us lunch. every time i've asked, he says okay i can do that, and it has literally never once happened. i've also always been the default ""coffee maker"" in the house. not even by choice, but because it eventually became expected of me. i drink caff, he drinks decaf. i've told him a few times it would be really sweet if he learned how to make the coffee, and perhaps how i like mine, since i've done the same for him. he's never made me a cup/pot, and if i'm not home to make his for him, he'll complain and be sad. i told him he should learn to do it himself and he said he likes me to do it. which i find irritating and childlike.

and yes, before you ask, i have at times just not done the thoughtful thing. for example, sometimes when he takes his nightly shower, i make a bedside water for each of us. not every night, but sometimes. the nights i haven't, he'll pout and ask why i didn't make him a water. one time i spoke honestly and said ""i was hoping maybe you could make us the waters tonight?"". i thought maybe it would motivate him to do it sometimes. but no, instead he told me i made him feel like shit with what i said. he said he's tired from work and really didn't need me to make him feel bad. and now he just makes himself a water. he doesn't make me one, and never has. like i said before, it's such a small gesture that can go so far.

every single time he asks me to do something for him now, which is constantly, i always want to scream WHAT DO YOU DO FOR ME? and then i feel like shit because he does financially support us. and then i feel like more shit because regardless of that, i'm still desperate to be thought of in other ways than financially. i've asked endlessly for flowers. i love flowers. he drives around the city all day for work and cant find the time to stop somewhere on the way home to get his wife flowers? it just hurts my feelings really bad. the last time i asked, he said i need to let him do thoughtful things without asking. so i stopped asking, but he doesn't do anything!!

when you read advice about communication in a marriage, it's often frowned upon to bring up things you do/don't do, when discussing an issue with your spouse. but i really wish i could do just that. i want to list out to him all the little, perhaps often invisible, things i do for him and our family every single day.  i always have to clean up after him. if i don't, it only hurts me because now i have to look at a mess i don't want to deal with + if i say hey can you clean this up he acts like i'm putting him out. and then if i tell him i hate how it seems like i'm putting him out, he fusses at me to stop trying to start a fight. and on top of those things, he asks me to do a million other things.

the only time he makes me feel thought of is my birthday and christmas, he's fine at those. but every other day of the year i feel like his maid/chef/whatever. i feel like a fucking nag all the time asking him to clean up after himself or show even the bare minimum amount of effort. i'll get him a treat or something when i leave the house. i'll make something he loves for dinner. i'll get that thing he needed at the store. but no one thinks of me. the once in a lifetime he does something even the bare minimum, he expects praise.

the other issue - aside from never doing thoughtful things, he also actively does things that give me more work to do. like every night we have dinner, we use cloth napkins. every single night, he leaves his dirty napkin out for me to clean up, usually on the floor. he has severe ocd, which i'm not going to explain too far in detail. but whenever something falls on the floor, a phone or charger or tv remote, it needs to be wiped off. well if he touches the thing, now he has to wash his hands, which he doesn't want to do, so he asks me to wipe the thing. he constantly leaves trash surrounding the can in the bathroom, but because he doesn't want to put his hand near the toilet, those things stay on the floor until i pick them up. he's constantly washing his hands, which makes us go through hand towels like crazy. when he has soaked a towel up, he just tosses it on the floor. but remember, he won't pick it up because then he'd have to wash his hands again.

resentment has absolutely brewed because this is how the days go: i take care of our kid all day, then he comes home and i take care of him, and then he asks me to do even more things, and if i don't want to, he makes me feel bad, and then i feel like no one has thought of me. he has used his job as an excuse for a lot of things, but when i worked full time i was still somehow able to think of him and what would make him happy. or at the very least try to avoid doing things that make his life harder. 

i have brought this issue up a few times briefly in the past, like during an incident where it was relevant. what i want to do now is give it a last hurrah, and sit him down and explain to him directly how serious this issue is to me. i need him to be more thoughtful, i need him to at least try to be considerate and think of all the shit i already do. his behavior has actively made me feel unloved. like it is very seriously affecting my happiness in our marriage.

he's verbally affectionate, always telling me how perfect and wonderful i am and how much he loves me. but i need his actions to show me, too. and his actions have made me feel very unloved for a long time. like this will seriously only affected our marriage more and more negatively as time goes on, and i need him to understand the weight of it. i realize this issue has changed me as a person as well, which makes me feel depressed. i have stopped doing nice things for him sometimes because i know he won't appreciate it, reciprocate it, or he'll just ask for more from me. it's completely deflated me.

i'm looking for advice on the exact language i can use to have this conversation, perhaps even some resources to try to get through his thick skull. he gets defensive about shit and tells me i make him feel like he can't do anything right and then i feel discouraged from ever talking about my feelings and i know that's not good, so i need some support from strangers. thanks for reading.

ps. yes i'm looking into therapy for myself. i brought up marriage counselling and he doesn't want to go. maybe this would be a good push to get him to be open to it.",2,1761007427.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

When I went back I felt like that I owe it to myself at least to see her and close that chapter for good, and that after 11 years was the least I could do and not ending things up through a video call. So I met her, had some coffee and we both decided to start a new chapter.

When I went back to the other country and met back with my current GF at first I told her I didn't met my ex but then I ended up saying it and she got super mad I did that and every time she could she would bring it up whenever we had a bad moment making me feel like shit. 

Since that point I felt I was the worst person ever to exist and would always blame myself for what I did.

Now it's been some time since that happened and I don't feel that much like that, but still do sometimes.

The problem that I am having is that they didn't ask me if to buy the couch, but they are basically telling me that I have to buy the couch. That i am not being a considerate roommate.

What I'm looking for in a space:
- Neighborhoods: Logan Circle, Dupont Circle, Shaw, U St, or Mt. Vernon Square. Petworth or AdMo would also work! 
- Max rent share  ~$2,000 (but willing to do more for the perfect situation). 
- Must haves: Central A/C & Heating, safe/covered spot for my e-bike, close proximity (< 1.5 miles) to a Metro/frequent bus line, and near coffee shops/grocery stores.
- Don't have any pets, but don't mind then as long as they are clean and friendly!

About Me:
I'm a 32 year old, black, liberal-minder, gay man working in the transit and technology space. I work from the office 5 days a week.

- Social Vibe: I love to cook (and will happily share!), sing, hang out with friends, and I'm looking for roommates who are interested in building a community. I don't need to hang out all the time, but would love to occasionally share a meal or watch a show.
- Interests: Exploring the built environment, biking, walking, coffee shops/bars, and going dancing every now and then!
- I prioritize open and direct communication. I am especially clean in common spaces (kitchen/bathroom) and have solid shared-living experience.

What I'm looking for in roommates:

Above all, I'm hoping to find people interested in creating a friendly, communal vibe, not just strangers sharing a lease.

No known trigger- I was in a meeting and was drinking the same decaf coffee I drink everyday (same brand, same creamer) I suddenly had bad acid reflux and esophagus spasm so I took a Gaviscon advance tablet. I immediately started burning all over my body and itching like I‚Äôve never itched before. Within five minutes my entire face was swollen and I had diahhrea.

Christmas 1974 A story of horse play, and life long pain.

Growing up in Southern California, I hated winter‚Äîor rather, the lack of it. When fall rolled around and people elsewhere pulled out scarves and mittens, I stared out at another sunny day. We didn‚Äôt get snow or frosty mornings. We got Santa Ana winds, some fog, and the occasional rain. Holidays came dressed in shorts and T-shirts.

Most Thanksgivings and Christmases hovered in the high 70s, sometimes 80s. I longed for sweater weather I‚Äôd never get. In 1974, nothing seemed different‚Äîuntil Christmas Day, when something shifted.

That morning turned out to be the 
most memorable Christmas of my life. I had been riding horses for years, but we couldn‚Äôt afford a saddle. My horse‚ÄîMiss Heidi Fraulein de Sch√∏n, or just Heidi‚Äîwas a Thoroughbred/Quarter Horse mix and my closest companion. She wasn‚Äôt broken when I got her, so I rode bareback or with a pad. We trusted each other, and we learned together. Riding bareback made me a solid rider. I can sit a horse like I was born to it.

That Christmas, I unwrapped a small box and found a leather cutout of a saddle on a keychain. As I puzzled over it, a larger package appeared. Inside was my first real saddle. I was speechless. Not since the blow dryer years earlier (that was EPIC) had a gift thrilled me so. I bolted to the pasture, called for Heidi, and cinched it onto her back. Our first true ride. 

What a glorious day‚Äîracing down country roads to show friends, my dog Simba loping beside us. It was a day I‚Äôll never forget.

The next day was warm, breezy. I was in the backyard when I saw my father in the field, hitching his boat to the truck. 

That had become a familiar scene‚Äîhis way of escaping arguments with my mother. He‚Äôd head to the coast, take the boat out, fish, and usually bring back a cooler of sea bass. I still remember how much I dreaded those fish dinners, my dad didn‚Äôt filet well, and my mother didn‚Äôt cook well - stinky, boney, fried fish. 

My little brother had just gotten a Stingray bike for Christmas. Eager for attention, he pedaled to the outer field to chat with our dad. I watched from a distance, not especially interested. At least he was trying. 

My older brother had always taken a different route for attention‚Äîpunching walls, once even shattering the front window with his fist - and other times punching me. 

As for me, I kept my distance and escaped on horseback. With my new saddle, I could go even farther.

The saddle became emblematic of so much‚Ä¶ good things seemed to always get destroyed easily by family conflict. But I hung onto that moment of joy for as long as I could. I still have the saddle keychain in my keepsake box by my bed. 

After a few minutes, my dad drove off with the boat. My brother came back and told us he was going fishing. He was proud he‚Äôd ridden out on his new bike to see his dad. It felt like any other day.

About half an hour later, my sister arrived‚Äîunexpectedly. She looked tense, my brother-in-law with her. They went inside to find my mother. Moments later, I heard the screaming. My mother burst from the house, hysterical, trying to get to her car. My sister and brother-in-law held her back as she fought to break free. My father had gone to my sister‚Äôs house that morning and told her he was leaving. He didn‚Äôt tell my mother himself - he was a coward.

That moment cracked our family open. My sister carried the weight of being the messenger for years. My older brother left and never returned. My little brother cried and cried. I felt relieved. I had already had him push me off his leg while crying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt leave us daddy‚Äù. That time he said he didn't love me. At least the constant fighting would stop. The flying coffee cups, the yelling‚Äîthat chaos was exhausting.

My mother sank into depression. Valium dulled the edges. My sister stepped into the vacuum, taking charge. She called a local minister, hoping for some sort of help. Within days, a Pentecostal preacher showed up. A week later, we were in church pews.

By the end of that first service, I was on my knees at the altar getting saved. That moment launched a long journey‚Äîfodder for more stories, maybe even a book someday, but it won‚Äôt glorify any religious elements in my life. 

I didn‚Äôt see my father for over ten years. That was my choice. My mother walked away from nearly everything. That was hers. Her decision led us into poverty. Mine gave me a little peace, but also years of trauma, guilt, self-loathing, and despair

I thought reconciling with him would fix me‚Ä¶ take away the gay. HA!

For the next 30 years after reconciling with my father, he was the only family connection I had, and I was the only child he stayed in touch with. 

Ironically my family was so torn and divided that my brothers rejected my dad because I reconciled. My sister and mother eventually rejected me for the same reason. End result total estrangement sans him. 

When I came out in 2009 I told him within days. He said he still loved me, and I believed him. But in the years that followed, he called maybe three times. Over time, I called called less and less, hoping he might take the initiative. He never did. 

The silence weighed on me‚Äîwas he sick? Still alive? Still able to pick up the phone?

I would (out of guilt) eventually call again. We had a brief, pleasant conversations, nothing deep. We were never a family that knew how to do deep, unless it came as accusations or resentment. That pattern continued for a several more years.

Then I learned my stepmother had passed, and my father had moved into assisted living. He lived another year. I visited him once, with my younger son. I flew from California to Little Rock for a five-hour visit. It was as hollow as every other conversation we‚Äôd ever had, but my son loved him without any of my baggage, so it was important for him.

A few months later, my son called to check in with him, as we both did periodically.. Someone at the facility said he‚Äôd been moved. It was their way of not telling us he‚Äôd been sent to hospice. I had to confirm his death by calling my stepmother‚Äôs son‚Äîhe‚Äôs just a year or two older than I am. After we left, he moved into my old bedroom. He got the security his mother demanded. I got the job of standing in for my father, holding up what was left of my mother. 

I never heard of a service, nothing from my father was offered to me, I don‚Äôt have any idea where his ashes went. His stepson who took my room at 16 years of age kept on taking.  

I have a few small things of his. The important one is a red tricycle‚Äîhis first. It will go to my younger son, the one who never stopped trying. He reminds me of my little brother. But unlike my brother, my son will never have to ride his bike into a field hoping for some of his father‚Äôs love.

A buddy of mine met his current partner through Reddit, so I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It‚Äôs definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I‚Äôve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast, made my way through the Ozarks, and now I‚Äôm slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever‚Äôs on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it‚Äôs a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I‚Äôm more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I‚Äôm pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who‚Äôs curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn‚Äôt mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I‚Äôm drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don‚Äôt have to be a traveler (though that‚Äôs always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

There‚Äôs this girl at work. She‚Äôs my age. I‚Äôm a level higher than her - I think she recognises that and is very professional so tries to act respectfully.

Lately I‚Äôve built up a good bond with her. I was attracted to her before, yes, but I‚Äôm realising how we‚Äôre similar in a lot of ways. She‚Äôs got an amazing personality. She pays attention to people, is kind, very hard working. She remembers things we talk about, initiates conversations when we‚Äôre working from the office.

We‚Äôve definitely had moments where it felt like she cares more than just a colleague. She‚Äôs careful about jokes - said she thought sometimes it‚Äôs very easy to read an immediate reaction on my face so she tempers them a little sometimes. She‚Äôs joined me for group drinks and stuff - nothing one to one. We‚Äôre working closely for the next 3 months (close enough that things could get awkward if they don‚Äôt work out, but also - we barely need to talk about work. Yet, we do.)

We also keep running into each other. In the streets, after work etc. My therapist said it felt like a slow burn. We‚Äôve had coffees together and they‚Äôre not about work. Therapist advised I make more of an attempt to ask her out. Not sure what to do though. Any help appreciated!",2,1761006381.0,TLDiamondDogs,1,1.0,False

1obyj50,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1obyj50/harvest_in_hikatoba/,Harvest in Hikatoba,"My name is Tamantha ‚ÄòTrouble‚Äô Turrell, if you're reading this, then Hikatoba, Idaho is gone.

It all started on September 21st. I woke up and went to my little dead-end job at Marinette's coffee house. A small mom-and-pop style coffee shop. Since our podunk town was too small for a Starbucks, this was the best we could do. I unlocked the employee entrance, got the machines up and running, and started making Mr. Sampson's order. Once the coffee was percolating, I unlocked the front door and flipped the sign. The same as always, nothing ever changes in Hikatoba.

At exactly 6:45 A.M., Mr. Sampson walked through the front door, like always. He was a large man; he towered over my staggering 5‚Äô5‚Äù like some biblical giant. He kind of looked like someone gave a gorilla a terrible haircut, all muscle and hair. His pug-like face scrunched up in what could be generously described as a smile, with his prominent canines on full display. ‚ÄúGood morning, Mr. Sampson, having a good day?‚Äù I asked in my best customer service voice, a fake smile on my face.

‚ÄúMorning, Miss Turrell. I'm having a wonderful day! Excited for the festival tonight?‚Äù His voice boomed out, shaking me from my routine momentarily. He was normally a very reserved man.

‚ÄúFestival? I haven't heard anything about it.‚Äù I had lived here my entire life, and we had never had a festival around this time.

‚ÄúAh, it‚Äôs the full moon harvest festival. Mayor Prescott decided to revive it this year. We haven't done it since I was a pup.‚Äù He gave a hearty chuckle after he spoke. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be in the town square tomorrow night, make sure to show up, lass. It‚Äôll be a celebration of a lifetime.‚Äù He paid and left shortly after.

Overly exuberant potato farmers aside, the rest of my shift passed like normal. With me doom-scrolling on my phone most of my shift, unfortunately interrupted on occasion to do my job. At 8:30 P.M., I wrapped up my shift by vaulting the day's meager earnings and cleaning the machines. It was 9 P.M. when I locked up the door and started on my way back home. The moon was out softly illuminating the two-lane road that ran through the center of town. Scattered street lamps lit up parts of the street better, but the majority of them were broken from generations of bored teenagers. Our small village couldn't even afford to replace them until next year.

I was about halfway back to my duplex when I felt the hair on the back of my neck rise. It felt like someone or something was watching me. Glancing around, the only thing I saw was the mist from my breath in the chilly autumn air. As I passed by an alleyway, I heard a trash can get knocked over and a loud gravelly hiss. The sound nearly made me jump out of my skin, and I spun around, quickly getting into what could liberally be called a boxer's stance. A large tomcat came streaking out of the alley and ran across the street. The relief I felt nearly sent me to my knees until I heard a howl.

We don't have a ton of wolves in Idaho, but we do have a decent population. Not enough to be hearing them in town, however. Later I figured it was probably someone‚Äôs hound dog or a coyote howling out. That fact didn't stop me from immediately racing back to my crappy little duplex, nearly dropping my keys as I hurriedly tried to unlock my door. When I finally got inside, I all but slammed the door shut, locking it before collapsing onto my rear right in front of it, sighing in relief at being safe in my home. The feeling of being watched was finally gone.

After a little while of calming myself down, I set about my nightly routine, turning on some music, showering, and reheating leftovers from 3 days ago. My half of the house was on the ground floor, and thankfully my upstairs neighbor was a truck driver who wouldn't be home for three more days, so I wouldn't have to listen to his booming footsteps all night. Turning off my music and flipping on the SYFY channel, I passed out on my hand-me-down couch to the dulcet tones of some B-rate horror flick about the Beast from the mountains or something equally cheesy.

Around midnight, I got woken up by some dumb werewolf movie. The howling and various other noises like scratching, sniffing, and growling must have gotten my sleep-addled brain to throw up some terrible dream thinking there was something at my own door, or at least that's what I thought at the time.

When morning arrived, I set about the herculean task of waking up. I was halted in my epic quest by my phone ringing. It was my boss, Mrs. Harriet. She was a sweet old lady whose husband had passed away a few years ago. ‚ÄúHello, Tammy dear, I just wanted to let you know you won't be needed at the shop today. I'm closing down for the festival, so go have fun and maybe meet a boy tonight. Like that Carson's boy, you know he's carried a torch for you since you both were in diapers.‚Äù She also elected herself my personal matchmaker.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be at that festival, Mrs. Harriet, and no, I will not be going with Scott Carson.‚Äù The jerk stole my cookies in elementary school and I will never forgive him. Her grandmotherly chuckle told me that she was by no means deterred.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see, dearie. Ah, I can't wait for you young‚Äôuns to see your first harvest. It was always such a treat as a child; the sky would light up like the Fourth back in the day.‚Äù Her wistful tone was almost reverent as if she was remembering an almost religious experience. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll let you go now, sweetie. Come say hello before the big finale, and if you bring a boy I'll buy you both a treat.‚Äù She bribed, making me roll my eyes.

We said our goodbyes and I promptly flopped back onto the couch, excited to relax for a little while longer than normal. By the time I actually got up and ready, it was noon. When I stepped outside, I could already hear the hustle and bustle of the locals setting up in the center of town about three blocks away. When I went to lock my door, I noticed it. The upper half of the windowless metal door was covered in claw marks: shallow furrows, widely spaced on its surface far too high for any hound or coyote.

A cold sense of dread filled me from the cruel revelation. I fled towards the center of town, not quite jogging but definitely fast walking. I hoped that being around others would keep me safe and calm me down. Even the scent of vinegar-covered French fries, finger steaks, and ice cream potatoes couldn't keep my mind off of the fear lancing through me. The festival was little more than a glorified street fair early in the day with small groups of teens and young adults milling about buying food and various knickknacks from street vendors, while the village elders set up street games and stalls. I meandered about, finding myself drawn to the large stage being set up at the center of the small park that was the town square.

I could recognize everyone setting up the stage with sound equipment and small braziers. It was mostly the male teachers from the local public school, but one face stood out, Mayor Prescott. Once I got to the foot of the stage, he greeted me with a warm smile. ‚ÄúMs. Tamantha Turrel, not causing any problems today?‚Äù

I winced at his words; this was the problem with tiny towns and villages. Everyone knew everyone and, worse, knew all the nonsense they got up to as kids. ‚ÄúNo, sir, Mayor Prescott, I'm just enjoying the fair. Promise.‚Äù I was a bit of a hellion growing up, and frequently got stern talking-to‚Äôs by the mayor and local sheriff, Tom Carson. Despite my reservations on dating the damnable cookie thief, Scott and I were thick as thieves when we were kids, always getting into trouble, and thankfully his dad would let us go with a slap on the wrist. Yay nepotism.

‚ÄúMhmm, I‚Äôm sure, Trouble.‚Äù I blushed at the old nickname. ‚ÄúScott is helping out with the dunk tank, would you mind lending him a hand? Someone needs to run the game while he gets drenched.‚Äù

A smirk filled with schadenfreude crossed my face as I happily agreed. He pointed me in the right direction and I made my way through the milling throngs that only seemed to grow as the day wore on. When I got to the tank, the six-foot, ginger lunk was sitting on the small diving board looking exceptionally bored. When he saw me approaching, he immediately groaned. ‚ÄúNo. No. No, not you, come on‚Äù He whined out, dragging out the n of on like a petulant child.

‚ÄúSorry, Scooter, mayor's orders,‚Äù I grinned up at him maliciously. He rolled his eyes and stuck out his tongue.

‚ÄúHow ya been, Trouble, break anyone's nose recently?‚Äù the bakery burglar cheeked back.

‚ÄúSteal any poor defenseless maiden‚Äôs sweets recently?‚Äù I asked in reply.

He snorted. ‚ÄúI never once stole any maiden‚Äôs sweets. I valiantly fought a dragon for her hoard,‚Äù He defended his honor with lies and slander.

I stared at him with a raised eyebrow, before raising my fist to the target that served as the idiot‚Äôs drop switch. He scoffed, ‚ÄúCheater. For real though, Tammy, how ya been? I hardly ever see you anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you left that farm of yours more than once a year, maybe I‚Äôd grace you with my beautiful visage,‚Äù I let my words linger for a second in false pretension before letting out a long sigh, the weight of last night‚Äôs events coming back in full force. ‚ÄúHonestly though, something followed me home last night. I'm a little freaked out.‚Äù

That got his attention quickly and he straightened up like a soldier on his little plywood seat. ‚ÄúWhat the hell? You‚Äôre not hurt, are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, Scott. I won't get my deposit back though. Whatever it was scratched my door the hell up. It might have been a wolf.‚Äù After a quick glance around, seeing no one coming toward us, I leaned closer to his Plexiglas tank. ‚ÄúPromise not to laugh?‚Äù He nodded and leaned in. ‚ÄúI think it was a huge werewolf,‚Äù I whispered to him. He immediately reeled back, laughing. His stupid belly laugh only infuriated me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious, Scott! There are freaking claw marks at the top of my door!"" I stamped my foot, my face flushing red at the admittedly crazy things leaving my mouth.

His peels of laughter died down, seeing my pissed-off face. ‚ÄúAll right, fine, fine, you got a werewolf stalker. Want me to get some silver bullets and come over tonight?‚Äù He could barely hide his building giggle fit behind a poker face that had gotten us into trouble more than once. The not-so-little shit.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I pouted, turning my crimson face away from him. I noticed with vindictive glee a group of teens heading our way. ‚ÄúHey, come on over and try to dunk the village idiot!‚Äù I yelled out, pointing to the poorly painted graphic on the side of the dunk tank showing the price. ‚ÄúOnly a dollar a throw!‚Äù The surge of euphoria I felt as they hurried our way and Scott's squawk of indignation was glorious.

The boys walked up, forking over the cash quickly. After I handed them their baseballs, they got lined up behind the line painted into the grass with spray paint, and immediately sent the big moron to his watery punishment. Peals of laughter escaped the boys at Scott's horrified yelp as he plunged into the chill water; his shaggy orange hair made him look like a wet sheepdog as he emerged from the depths grumbling about evil women. The rest of our afternoon continued like that: banter, fake arguments, and me egging passersby to come dunk him whenever he got the upper hand. I wish I knew it would be the last time I ever heard the big guy‚Äôs laugh.

As sunset rolled around, I helped Scott out of the tank and followed him over to the nearby ice cream parlor that was being used as a public restroom. He dried off and got changed before rejoining me. ‚ÄúHey Tam, sorry for laughing earlier. My offer still stands if you're not feeling safe. Although I don‚Äôt think I have any silver bullets. A .45 usually stops whatever you put it into,‚Äù he said, showing me the pistol he's keeping hidden under a button-up shirt. It was hanging in an appendix carry holster, looking like his dad‚Äôs old 1911.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd appreciate that,"" I told him haltingly. We strolled for a few minutes, the sunset‚Äôs purple and orange hues illuminating the world in a soft glow. The braziers scattered around the park were lit by volunteers, casting an almost comforting glow around the quickly darkening world. That's when I saw Mrs. Harriet.

‚ÄúMrs. Harriet!‚Äù I ran up, Scott on my heels like a lovesick puppy as I jogged up to my boss. She kept walking toward the stage oblivious to us. ‚ÄúMrs. Harriet, how are you?‚Äù I asked once we got to her side.

She kept walking, not looking over at us. ‚ÄúCome on, dear, we can‚Äôt be late for the prayer.‚Äù She led the way to the stage in a quick old lady shuffle, excited to share a moment of her youth with us. I could do without praying to a God I don't believe in, but I supposed indulging an old lady wouldn't kill me, so I followed. As we arrived, we were a bit late, managing to snag the lucrative spot at the very back of the crowd. She finally acknowledged our presence fully. ‚ÄúOh, so you did take my advice, dear?‚Äù Her smirk was insufferable. ‚ÄúNo sneaking off to go make out, the end of the festival is the best part, dear.‚Äù Turning from my flustered self, she looked over at Scott. ‚ÄúYou behave too, little scooter.‚Äù

Seeing she turned us both into tongue-tied messes, she gave out a quick cackle of old-lady laughter before turning to the stage, as the mayor walked out to the center of it wearing a weird cloak. It was a shade of green that reminded me of the deep woods right at the cusp of night, or the depths of the ocean. ‚ÄúDwellers of Hikatoba!‚Äù The mayor‚Äôs voice boomed out, the speakers on stage barely working but in the hushed silence of twilight his voice carried far and loud. ‚ÄúTonight we celebrate the equinox, and harvest for the Lord.‚Äù

‚ÄúRush‚Äôtavg,‚Äù the voices of the older villagers resonated out in the park. It was then I noticed everyone under 30 was in the center of the group with only me and Scott being outliers. I looked at him quizzically, silent, trying to ask him if he knew what the hell the old folks just said. He just shrugged, shaking his head no.

‚ÄúWhen the moon is at its zenith, the harvest shall begin and our worship shall be rewarded!‚Äù the mayor continued, uncaring of the confusion spreading among the youngest members of the village. Some fearfully chatted, and looked around.

‚ÄúRush‚Äôtavg,‚Äù the elders chanted once more, and I was brutally reminded of last night's events as the feeling of being watched resurfaced once again. The moon began to rise, a sickly pale green glow emanating off of it as it peeked through the tree line, looking far larger than ever before. It was like someone had pulled it hundreds of miles toward the earth, and it felt like it was staring down on the village's ritual.

‚ÄúThe time of celestial alignment is upon us, my flock, raise your voice and bring forth your prayers for the Lord,‚Äù the mayor intoned to the gathered mass as a slow fog crept into the clearing.

‚ÄúRush‚Äôtavg,‚Äù the monotone chant echoed out once more. I looked over and saw Mrs. Harriet's eyes were clouded over in a midnight black. She looked like she was possessed. With a loud thud, my eyes were wrenched back to the stage as a new, large, inhuman figure took up its place behind the mayor. It was shaped like a hound, but completely wrong. It was about ten feet tall, sitting on its haunches. Its body seemed to shift and rip open, revealing maws lined with sharpened canines, and eyes that looked to be cut from jade‚Äîall color, no pupil, no cornea. Where eyes would be on a normal dog, the mutant mutt had additional slobbering maws, tongues hanging freely, pointed and coated in sickening red goopy slobber. Its eyeless head fixated on me for a moment, and the feeling of being watched increased a thousandfold.

‚ÄúThe Lord is pleased with this season's harvest! He has sent his carrier to us.‚Äù The mayor preached to his faithful, uncaring of the fearful murmurs of the gathered young at the center of the crowd. Scott grabbed my arm, pulling my attention from the hound‚Äôs unfaltering stare. My mind pounded as he motioned with his head. I nodded in agreement to his unspoken plan to run while we could.

‚ÄúRush‚Äôtavg Nah Vir Sah‚Äôtohem,‚Äù the crowd began to chant and raise their arms. Scott and I slowly backed away, keeping our eyes locked on the occult scene before us. I swear the sky flashed, lit up in an ethereal green like the aurora borealis had decided to appear. It was gone before I could blink, and the hound stood, its eyeless sockets in its face still locked on us. The elders‚Äô arms lowered, locking in a ring around the younger townsfolk, and the beast stepped down among them. Its eye tongues lashed out, tasting and sampling frightened young adults and children. It stopped in front of Susan Chalimege, a 7-year-old kid who would come by the coffee shop for baked goods we‚Äôd sell. It took a long sniff of her face before snorting and looking back up at me, the various shifting eyes across its body squinting before it gave out a low bark. The bass of it reverberated through my bones even though Scott and I were almost a football field away. The sky flashed again, longer this time. There were swirls of the cloudy green substance in the sky writhing through the air like great worms swimming through the ether. They were gone a moment later.

Scott and I turned after the abomination barked and started sprinting down the road. We could hear the creature's thunderous paws pound the ground behind us in a haunting rhythm. It felt like death itself was chasing us down the road. Its low, resonating howl echoed in the night air. The fearful cries of the children in the park and the mayor's elated shout of ‚ÄúThe carrier has chosen this season's harvest!‚Äù acted as sickening backup singers to the howl‚Äôs lead vocals. Realizing either Scott or I was chosen by some fucked-up mix of hound and demon as a sacrifice made us run even harder.

Once we made it halfway to my place, Scott turned to me, his face hauntingly gorgeous backlit by the ever-flickering sky, black tendrils now sweeping the cosmic green slurry in the flashes. ‚ÄúGo, I‚Äôll slow it down. Get somewhere safe, Trouble,‚Äù His words greatly irked me as he pulled the pistol and started to slow down.

‚ÄúThe hell you will, Scott Mathias Carson! You have to protect me from werewolves tonight!‚Äù I screamed at him, tears beginning to form in my eyes knowing what the idiot was planning.

He just gave me that damn lopsided smile before whispering, ‚ÄúI am.‚Äù He stopped completely and turned. ‚ÄúGet safe and leave this shithole like ya always wanted to, Trouble! I got this!‚Äù His yell was accompanied by hot stinging trails of tears scorching down my cheeks as I kept running. The gunshots behind me echoed hollowly into the night, each blast emphasized with another flash from the sky, its eyes watching me in cruel indifference. They were emeralds, like the abomination‚Äôs eyes but blown up to massive size like blimps in the sky. At that scale you could see the center looked like waterfalls into endless voids of green, a strange depth endless but visible. My head throbbed in pain as I ran into my door. The gunshots went silent and the screaming started as I fumbled my keys trying desperately to get them into the damn lock. The key slotted into the lock and the screaming stopped with a sickening squelching pop.

I slammed my door shut, hoping it was up for a repeat of last night's performance, as I huddled in my closet. I pulled out my phone and started to write this warning. Hopefully whatever is covering the sky can't block wifi. Even now, after writing this all out, I can hear the beast pounding on my door using Scott‚Äôs voice trying to get me to leave. ‚ÄúTrouble, come on. You were chosen. It's a great honor.‚Äù I can feel the moon's loving gaze bearing down fully on the village, its tendrils reaching down and tenderly caressing the streets. Please heed my warning: Hikatoba is gone, do not come.",3,1761006273.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1obygr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GirlDads/comments/1obygr0/my_daughter_is_shutting_down/,My daughter is shutting down,"I'm a single father (37) to my daughter (15), let's call her Ellie. 
Her mom died when she was a baby, and I've been raising her on my own ever since. 

I've been involved and supportive in every phase of her life growing up. Ballet classes, her horse phase (for about a year when she was 8 until 9, it was all she would talk about), princess obsession, all that.

Now since she started high school, she's been quiet and sullen and shutting down, especially these past few months. 
I've asked her about it several times since I noticed the change in her attitude, but she always tells me that she's okay. Then a week ago she snapped at me when I asked how things were at school, and she refused to tell me why. Since then, I've kind of been on edge. 

I've always made sure that she knows that she can talk to me about everything. And she always has, until lately.

I've wanted to pry, but she keeps shutting down. I got in contact with a child therapist but Ellie refused to go, so I had to make her get into the car to go to that appointment. 
She seemed a little lighter when she was done and came out to the waiting room. I casually asked her about it on the way home, but she closed down again. 

Then last night (Sunday), I woke up to noises downstairs. She was in the kitchen, drinking coffee. When I asked her why she was having caffeine in the middle of the night, she told me that she had a school paper she had to get done by Tuesday. She seemed really stressed out. 

I asked her if she needed help with her essay, and she just broke down. She literally fell to the floor and started crying her heart out. I sat down and tried my best to comfort her.
She's always liked cocoa and cartoons when she's been upset ever since she was a kid, so I got her to the couch and put on some cartoons, then I made cocoa (with cinnamon, she got her mother's taste somehow). But she refused to drink it. 

I have no idea what's going on with her. She's had sporadic appointments with her therapist, but there's obviously the confidentiality. And I respect that boundary, but I'm going insane here. 

I've twisted my brain for every explanation, like bullying, anxiety or depression. Maybe even an ED? Maybe something traumatic happened? I've talked to her teachers at school, and they know her to be quiet, when she's always been energetic and sassy until now.

What do I do? She's always been open with me, and I've always been available to her and made sure that she knows she can tell me everything. I know teenagers don't tell their parents everything... but something seems seriously wrong with my daughter.

This is just a rant but I wanted to get you're opinion on this matter.  I'll just insert the email I sent to coffee bean through their website.

Dear Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Customer Service,

‚ÄãI am writing to express my extreme disappointment with my experience at your Little Tokyo location on Alameda Avenue this morning, 9/30/2025, around 8:04 AM.

‚ÄãUpon entering the store, I saw there were only two baristas struggling to manage a packed queue of online and in-person orders. They were rightly turning away customers and stating they wouldn't take new orders for 15 minutes. To try and help the situation, I stepped out and placed a mobile order for my drink at approximately 8:06 AM.

‚ÄãUnfortunately, the situation did not improve. I waited in the store until 8:25 AM‚Äîa total of 19 minutes after placing my online order‚Äîand my drink was still not ready. With at least three other mobile orders ahead of mine, I was forced to leave without my drink to keep my own schedule. I spoke with the barrista and told her I had to leave and she said she would cancel the order and it would go back on my card. 

‚ÄãThis level of service is unacceptable. While I sympathize with the two baristas who were clearly overwhelmed and understaffed, it does not excuse a customer having to wait 19 minutes for an order that was placed online and then having to abandon it entirely.

‚ÄãI request a full refund for my order. My order details are:

‚ÄãOrder Number: xxxxxxxxxxx
‚ÄãOrder Time: Approximately 8:04 AM
‚ÄãItem Ordered: cookie butter ice coffee
‚ÄãAmount Paid: $6.05

‚ÄãPlease process this refund immediately and look into the staffing and online order management at this busy location.

‚ÄãThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

For the record,  I just wanted then to refund the amount back on to my app so I could use at a later time. Why do I have to go through hoops and ladders. I initially contacted your customer service team on September 30, 2025, and have since been caught in a loop of automated responses stating, ""we received your email, our team will review and get very back to you shortly."" This inadequate process has been ongoing for over three weeks, despite my repeated attempts to provide all necessary documentation. I'm I the only one who's experienced this type of customer service from corporate? I don't even blame the barristas and I wasn't mad when I had to leave the store without my coffee. The customer service is horrible. Any advice?",1,1761005902.0,coffeebeantealeaf,0,1.0,False

1obyd6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1obyd6g/where_can_i_find_this_its_so_good_already/,Where can I find this? It's so good already!,"‚ÄúTonight, you‚Äôre going to tell Derek your feelings. You can‚Äôt be stuck in the friend zone forever,‚Äù I whispered to myself, my reflection staring back at me. ‚ÄúNo backing down. Don‚Äôt be a coward.‚Äù
 
From the first day I saw Derek in college, I hadn‚Äôt been able to think about much else. With his easy smile encased by that perfectly chiseled jaw and his piercing eyes that almost looked right through me, how could I not? 
 
Derek was the campus star athlete, admired by every boy and desired by every girl, but somehow, he always seemed to make me feel important. Like I mattered. 
 
Now that Derek and I had been friends for a while, I knew his high school girlfriend broke his heart and he had not dated anyone since. 
 
So when he asked me to join his party tonight, I figured it would be my chance to jump out of the friend zone before it was too late.
 
I had to tell him my feelings tonight. 
 
Now, standing in the restroom of the bar where the party was being held, I studied my reflection in the mirror. The low fluorescent lighting was still too bright. I was suddenly very aware of every flaw on my face, from my freckled nose to the zit on my forehead that seemed to show up out of nowhere.
 
My fingers fumbled through my purse until I felt the smooth plastic tube of blush. I pulled it out and ran it across each side of my face. The subtle shade of pink made me look shy, I thought. Maybe even a little innocent?
 
Pushing myself away from the mirror, I stood back and gave myself one last look. Makeup, okay. Chest, decent. Bum, pretty nice, if I say so myself. 
 
‚ÄúWell. Here goes nothing,‚Äù I muttered to my reflection.
 
My heart felt like it might jump right out of my chest as I pushed the bathroom door open. The echo of my pulse thudded in my ears louder than the music that shook the walls through the hallway.
 
Thankfully, the second I entered the hallway, I spotted what I was looking for. 
 
Derek.
 
There he was, leaning casually against the wall like he owned it. Drink in his hand - probably whisky - and his golden-brown hair caught the light from the amber bulbs hanging from the tiled ceiling.
 
Even in the crowded bar, Derek stood out like a flame in the dark.
 
His eyes looked up at me, brightening the moment they met mine. 
 
For a second, I swore his gaze actually glowed. Not just the sparkle of amusement he gave me with his usual smile, no, it was a blazing silver glow I had never seen before.
 
I blinked, and the glow was gone.
 
I shook my head. Maybe I‚Äôd had one too many drinks?
 
‚ÄúWow,‚Äù Derek said as he walked over to me, his eyes moving from mine down to my little black dress. He smiled slowly. ‚ÄúHailey, you look‚Ä¶ beautiful.‚Äù
 
His voice was gruff, sending tingles through my stomach and lower. That deep tone got me every time. 
 
My cheeks felt hot. ‚ÄúOh, uh, thanks. You don‚Äôt look so bad yourself.‚Äù
 
I inwardly cringed. God, I‚Äôm an idiot.
 
He huffed out a laugh and took a step closer, leaving very little space between us. ‚ÄúNot so bad? Ouch.‚Äù
 
He was a world-class tease, leaning into me, allowing the smell of his burly cologne to wrap around me, warm and woodsy. The intimate moment almost made me forget we were surrounded by people, music pulsing through the walls. 
 
I gave myself a quick reminder to play it cool. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry.‚Äù I murmured with eyes cutting up at him, smiling. ‚ÄúYou clean up nice.‚Äù 
 
A grin stretched across his face. 
 
This is it, I thought, my heart pounding in my chest. Now is the right time to spill everything. I hadn‚Äôt practiced in front of a bathroom mirror for nothing.
 
‚ÄúDerek, I‚Ä¶‚Äù Just as the words started to slip out of my mouth, the front door swung open, and almost all eyes dashed in its direction.
 
In she came. A tall brunette with a kind of effortless beauty that made heads turn without her even trying. Her dark curls bounced with every annoyingly confident step, heels tapping out a rhythm against the hardwood that seemed to own the room. 
 
And just like that, the air shifted. People noticed. He noticed.
 
‚ÄúJessica!‚Äù Derek lit up like the sun breaking through clouds. His voice was warm and excited.
 
Too excited. I frowned.
 
Before I could even start my confession, the girl neared, and he was already moving toward her like a magnet, wrapping his arms around her like he‚Äôd been waiting for her.
 
My throat went so dry I could barely swallow, words sticking on my tongue, heart pounding in my chest. 
 
But the weirdest part was, I couldn‚Äôt look away.
 
Oh, I wished I could.
 
Frozen like a wax statue, I watched him press a kiss to her cheek, lingering for longer than necessary. 
 
Who was this Jessica, anyway?
      
‚ÄúHailey,‚Äù Derek shouted over the music in a gravely tone, glancing at my awe-stricken face. ‚ÄúThis is Jessica. My girlfriend.‚Äù
 
My stomach plummeted. Girlfriend?
 
Grinning like the universe had gifted her to him, he said, ‚ÄúShe just transferred here.‚Äù He looked back to the tall beauty. ‚ÄúWe grew up in the same town, over in Huntsville. We dated for two years in high school before‚Ä¶‚Äù he hesitated. ‚ÄúAnyway, now we‚Äôre back together.‚Äù
 
My stomach crumbled and churned all at once. Jessica was that high school ex of Derek, the one who hurt him so badly that he hadn‚Äôt dated anyone after her. 
 
Was he waiting for her the whole time?
 
Jessica tilted her head to the side, almost with sympathy for me, but her smile was edged like glass. ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre Hailey.‚Äù She smiled, but there was no warmth or kindness in it.
 
The way she said my name made me want to vomit. My skin began to prickle as I forced my lips into something that could maybe be mistaken for a smile. ‚ÄúNice to meet you.‚Äù 
 
I lied. It was far from nice. It was the most horrible thing, at the worst possible time.
 
Derek was oblivious to what was happening before him. ‚ÄúDrinks are on me,‚Äù he said cooly, turning back toward her as his hand settled on her hip like it knew that spot well. He glanced at me almost as an afterthought. ‚ÄúWhat would you like, Hailey?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúAnything‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I managed to say, trying to mask how hurt I felt. ‚ÄúJust make it strong.‚Äù
 
Jessica‚Äôs eyes shimmered as she swept them over me, up then down like she was counting my flaws. ‚ÄúBold choice.‚Äù Her voice dripped with sweetness, but underneath it, I caught the sharp mockery.
 
An awkward silence fell between us.
 
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, not able to stand it any longer. ‚ÄúYou and Derek, together again, huh?‚Äù I said lamely.
 
‚ÄúThat is what ‚Äògirlfriend‚Äô means,‚Äù she said cooly, looking at her fingernails. Then she looked up at me. ‚ÄúOh, I bet you‚Äôve never been a girlfriend before, that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt know what it means.‚Äù She gave me a fake pout, then an evil smirk.
 
My cheeks burned and I decided maybe awkward silence wasn‚Äôt so bad after all.
 
As soon as Derek returned with our drinks, Jessica walked up to him, her eyes staring into mine. She wrapped her arms around his neck and gave him a long passionate kiss, glancing at me every so often. 
 
‚ÄúI missed you baby,‚Äù she said, before jamming her entire tongue in his mouth. 
 
After that Derek seemed to forget I was there. I sat awkwardly next to them, Jessica in his lap, and prayed to God that the floor would open up and take me away from here. 
 
I tossed back drink after drink, but it didn‚Äôt stop my pain. Not when every ridiculous smile between them was another knife sliding deeper into my heart.
 
I downed my last bit of vodka and decided I couldn‚Äôt stand another second of this. I shoved my chair back, the room spinning, and I stumbled my way to the door.
 
Staggering into the darkness, the night air slapped my flushed skin. The music still pulsed behind me, a dull reminder I tried to escape.
 
And then, through the haze of my drunken sight, I saw him again. Derek. 
 
Or at least, it appeared to be him. 
 
It was the shape of him. It had his stride. But the clothes seemed a bit different from how they were inside the bar. 
 
It has to be Derek. Who else could it be? 
 
‚ÄúMake up your mind,‚Äù I slurred aloud, partly to him, partly to myself.
 
The ground tilted, my knees buckling forward. Strong hands caught me before I hit the pavement, steadying me against a solid chest that felt both foreign and familiar all at once.
 
‚ÄúWhoa.‚Äù His voice sounded even a bit deeper than usual. Probably because Derek was a bit drunk too. ‚ÄúEasy there.‚Äù
 
I blinked up. Derek‚Äôs face stared back. The same hair, the same perfect jawline. But his eyes weren‚Äôt brown. They glowed faintly gold, like embers over a fire.
 
The alcohol must really be messing with me tonight. He seems different. And yet the same. Typical Derek coming to my rescue.
 
I couldn‚Äôt control my words that followed, they just flew out of my drunk mouth. ‚ÄúYou have no idea how much I love you,‚Äù my voice cracked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve loved you since I saw you for the first time.‚Äù 
 
His grip on my shoulders tightened.
 
I buried my face against him, my voice hoarse and trembling. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you see me like that?‚Äù
 
The silence was heavy between us. I had to force myself to look up, expecting rejection, maybe pity. Instead, his eyes got that silver glow again.
 
So I didn‚Äôt see that wrong earlier tonight?
 
But before I could say anything about his eyes, he pulled me into him with his hands roaming softly over the thin cotton of my dress, as I could feel his manhood growing under his pants.
 
My breath hitched.
 
Before I realized what I was doing, I grabbed his face and pressed my lips hard against his.
 
 
 
 
 
Chapter 2: One Night Mistake
 
Hailey‚Äôs POV
        
He didn‚Äôt pull away. Instead, to my surprise, he pressed even harder into mine. He gently bit my lower lip, making me moan softly. 
 
His hands moved down my back. His lips grazed my ear. Goosebumps peppered my entire body as he whispered, ‚ÄúHow about we go back to my place?‚Äù
 
All I could do was nod. Then I froze, suddenly remembering. ‚ÄúWait! What about Jessica?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWho?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúGood answer,‚Äù I said.
  
We couldn‚Äôt keep our lips off each other as we made our way from his car to his dorm. It occurred to me that this was not where I remembered the freshman dorms were, but that thought was fleeting.
 
I kissed his neck as he fumbled with his keys. I reached my hand around, teasing him by rubbing near his groin. He responded with what sounded like a low growl and I let out a giggle. He finally got the door open and he pulled me inside.
 
Before he even closed the door all the way we began tearing each other‚Äôs clothes off. He paused when I was down to my lacy black bra and matching panties.
 
‚ÄúMy god,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúYou are beautiful.‚Äù
 
I felt my face turn hot. Then I smiled and pulled off his undershirt. I let out a soft gasp. I knew Derek worked out a lot for football, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting the rock hard abs and chest. I gently reached out and touched his chest. 
 
Damn he‚Äôs sexy, I thought, biting my lip.
 
‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he said softly, grabbing my hand and leading me back to his bedroom. My heart pounded in my chest. How long had I dreamt of this exact moment?
 
He pulled me into his arms and began kissing me again, walking me backwards until we both fell onto the bed. I rolled over on top of him and sat up. My fingers trembled as I unhooked my bra and slid it off. I felt his bulge pulse under me, and I could feel myself growing even wetter.
 
‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù he whispered, his hands gently cupping my breasts. I leaned forward and kissed his neck, causing him to let out a soft moan. I reached down to pull off his boxers and then wrapped my hand around him, stroking him while I moved my lips to his.
 
In one sudden movement, he threw me onto my back ad tore my panties off. He climbed on top of me and pressed his hips against mine. The anticipation of what was about to happen sent a shiver all over my body.
 
When he entered me, I let out a soft moan. 
His hard chest pressed against mine as he thrust hard into me, over and over.
 
This was my dream came true. At least that was what I believed.
 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stop,‚Äù I whispered.
 
After hearing what I said, he thrusted harder and faster until I felt him pulsing inside of me. 
 
He pushed one last time into me and held it there. 
 
I squeezed myself tight around his still bulging cock, my legs trembling as I felt myself getting closer and closer to climaxing. 
 
He pulled out slightly and thrust back into me one last time, finally sending me over the edge. 
 
We came together.
 
I held him tight, letting the overwhelming waves of ecstasy wash over me until they slowly faded away.
 
He laughed as he rolled off of me, then he pulled me close to him. 
 
‚ÄúWe are not finished here,‚Äù he said.
 
‚ÄúWhat-‚Äù He wanted a round two?
 
‚ÄúYOU told me not to stop,‚Äù he said, already climbing back on top of me. ‚ÄúToo late to regret it now.‚Äù
 

 
The next afternoon, the sound of a motorcycle revving its engine jerked me awake. 
 
I sat up suddenly, my head pounding. I groaned as I grabbed it.
 
I looked over at Derek, who had his back to me and was still asleep. I smiled. Totally worth the hangover I had to deal with.
 
I wrapped an arm around him and kissed his shoulder.
 
‚ÄúMm,‚Äù he moaned softly. ‚ÄúHey, beautiful.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúHey there‚Ä¶‚Äù I started as he turned towards me. I gasped.
 
The man next to me looked a lot like Derek, but it was not Derek. I pulled the sheet up over my still bare chest. 
 
Oh god. Oh no‚Ä¶
 
‚ÄúLast night was amazing,‚Äù not-Derek said, sitting up. He wrapped his arm around my waist, pulling me closer to him.
 
Oh, no, he wants another round.
 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù I moved his arm off of me and scooted away. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made a mistake‚Ä¶‚Äù
 
He squinted his eyes. ‚ÄúA mistake, huh?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúNo, nothing against you. I just‚Ä¶mistook you for someone else‚Ä¶‚Äù I tried to explain as I looked around for my clothes. 
 
I saw my bra and panties, but that was it. I grabbed them and tried to slither into them without letting the blanket expose me.
 
‚ÄúSomeone else? Who?‚Äù He laid back, his arms crossed behind his head. He stared at me with a smirk.
 
I bit my lip, hesitating. Should I try and explain? I mean, did he really need to know I mistook him for Derek?
 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long story. I probably should go. Again, so sorry.‚Äù 
 
I hurried into the living room. There I spotted my dress, shoes, and purse scattered all over the floor.
 
‚ÄúJesus, Hailey,‚Äù I muttered to myself. I pulled my dress over my head, grabbed my shoes and purse and quietly slipped out the front door.
 
I hurried down the hall and around the corner, where I found the stairwell. Once I was through the door and down a flight of stairs, I let myself rest against the wall to take a second. 
 
I slid into my shoes and thanked God I got out of there as fast as I did. I wanted to put last night far, far behind me.
            
The sunlight hit me hard as I stepped out of the dorm building. I groaned, digging around in my purse for my sunglasses, but no luck. I covered my eyes with my free hand, leaving just enough space between my fingers to see the sidewalk.
 
I did the walk of shame the few blocks from the dorms to the bar parking lot, where I had left my car. 
 
Thankfully it was the weekend and not many people were around to see me. I wanted to get away from this campus and hide in my old bedroom at mom‚Äôs for the entire weekend.
 
Just as I reached my car, I heard my phone ding loudly in my purse. I jumped, the loud bell-like notification piercing my ears.
 
‚ÄúShh,‚Äù I said as I pulled it out of my purse. I narrowed my eyes at the phone, squinting against the bright screen.
 
Derek!
 
‚ÄúHey, I just wanted to make sure you made it home okay. I was worried about you last night,‚Äù he had messaged.
 
My heart skipped a beat in my chest.
 
‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I typed. ‚ÄúThanks for checking on me.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going home for the weekend, but feel free to reach out if you need me,‚Äù he responded.
 
 I sighed. If he was going home, that probably meant Jessica would be joining him.
 
I started to put my phone in my purse when it began ringing with a phone call. I groaned again.
 
‚ÄúWhy are you so loud!‚Äù I snapped as I pushed accept.
 
‚ÄúHey Mom,‚Äù I said when it connected.
 
‚ÄúHoney, I have the best news,‚Äù she said without greeting me. I inwardly laughed. Mom was not one for small talk. ‚ÄúAre you sitting down?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúNo, but I think I can manage,‚Äù I said, fumbling through my purse for my car keys.
 
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said, then gave a long dramatic pause. ‚ÄúI have been seeing someone.‚Äù
 
I dropped my keys on the ground, stunned by the sudden announcement. I didn‚Äôt know my mom had been dating. ‚ÄúOh, mom, that‚Äôs great!‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been talking about getting married, and‚Ä¶‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWait, what? Married?‚Äù
 
Mom kept going, ignoring me. ‚Äú...we think you should meet him. I‚Äôm going to his place this weekend, maybe you could join us?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúI, uh‚Ä¶‚Äù my head was spinning. I didn‚Äôt even know mom was dating, and she‚Äôs already thinking about marrying this man? I wasn‚Äôt sure I was ready for all this.
 
Although, I figured I should probably meet the man if he was going to be my stepdad.
 
‚ÄúOkay, yeah, sure,‚Äù I said.
 
‚ÄúOh wonderful! Meet me at the house, and we can pack a few things together,‚Äù Mom said. ‚ÄúThen we will drive to Huntsville, where he lives.‚Äù
 
Huntsville. Where had I heard that town name before?
 
‚ÄúOkay, bye,‚Äù I muttered to myself, shaking my head. 
 
This was turning into quite a weird weekend.

 
 
 
 
Chapter 3: Huntsville
 
Hailey‚Äôs POV
 
Huntsville was a little over thirty miles from the town of Glendale where Mom and my university were.
 
I leaned back against the headrest and closed my eyes, waiting for the ibuprofen to kick in. It wasn‚Äôt very often I drank to the point of getting a hangover, and this afternoon I remembered why that was.
 
‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù mom asked.
 
I opened my eyes. ‚ÄúYeah, just a late night last night.‚Äù
 
Mom smirked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have Aaron make you some strong coffee when we get there.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYes please,‚Äù I said.
 
I looked out the window, watching as the sparse trees of Glendale began to turn into forests. The motion made me nauseous and I closed my eyes again.
 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôve never heard of this place,‚Äù I said.
 
‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs a small town I guess,‚Äù Mom said.
 
‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt been here yet?‚Äù I said, surprised.
 
Mom shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, not yet. It‚Äôs only been about a month, he always comes to me,‚Äù she said with a shrug.
 
My head was spinning. All of this was happening so fast. But mom seemed happy, so I kept my opinions to myself.
 
‚ÄúIn 200 feet, take a left turn at Highway 380,‚Äù mom‚Äôs phone GPS instructed. Mom slowed to turn.
 
I cracked open my eyes and looked around as we pulled into the small town. It gave off old west kind of vibes, with its cobblestone streets and old-fashioned store fronts.
 
‚ÄúWoah,‚Äù I said. Whatever I was expecting, this was not it. It was very different from all of the bigger towns that surrounded it.
 
Mom smiled. ‚ÄúOh, isn‚Äôt this the cutest little town!‚Äù She looked at her phone and frowned. ‚ÄúWhat the‚Ä¶‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù I asked.
 
‚ÄúMy map app,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not getting a signal. Can you try yours?‚Äù
 
I pulled my phone out and typed in the address mom gave me, but it was as if this little town didn‚Äôt even exist on the map.
 
‚ÄúOh well,‚Äù Mom said, her smile returning. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just have to do this the old fashioned way.‚Äù
 
She pulled into a gas station and went inside. I stayed in the car, but when I noticed two of the locals standing at the pumps glaring at me, I decided to join her. 
 
I got out of the car, watching the men at the pump. They gave me a small nod, but still with a wary look. I returned the nod and hurried into the gas station.
 
My mother was talking with the clerk when I entered, giving her the same wary look as the two outside had given me. 
 
I walked past someone picking out a candy bar, and they watched me the entire way to the counter. A chill went down my spine.
 
‚ÄúI beg your pardon miss, but what did you say your name was again?‚Äù the clerk asked my mother.
 
‚ÄúOh! I didn‚Äôt,‚Äù Mom said. ‚ÄúMy name is Hannah Burke, and this is my daughter, Hailey.‚Äù
 
The clerk‚Äôs entire demeanor changed at the sound of our names. He grinned. ‚ÄúOh, Ms. Burke! We‚Äôve been expecting you. He",1,1761005813.0,novelsfree,1,1.0,False

i feel like it comes very naturally to me to think of my husband throughout the day, and it's hardly any effort for me to do things that make his life easier. he works full time, i'm a stay at home mom to our toddler. he often uses being tired from work as an excuse for being inconsiderate/forgetful, and while sometimes i can excuse certain things, i don't think working full time should keep you from thinking of your spouse. in fact, he often does things that just gives me more work to do (like cleaning up his messes). when i worked full time when we were dating, i did small gestures for him almost everyday. surprise him with coffee, flowers, a small gift i found when i was out and about, and more.

in the beginning of our relationship we discussed love languages. his is words of affirmation, and i follow through on that multiple times a day, every day. always have. i remind him how much i love him, how good of a father he is, etc. mine would be acts of service. that doesn't mean waiting on me hand and foot, it means doing small gestures/tasks to show me you thought of me. it could be as small as making me a cup of coffee, offering to do a chore i normally have the responsibility of doing, making meal i love, etc. he doesn't do any of that. ever. i do not feel thought of by him.

i'm the cook of the house, which is honestly fine with me 99% of the time. but i have communicated multiple times now that it would be nice if on his days off, he occasionally offered to make us lunch. every time i've asked, he says okay i can do that, and it has literally never once happened. i've also always been the default ""coffee maker"" in the house. not even by choice, but because it eventually became expected of me. i drink caff, he drinks decaf. i've told him a few times it would be really sweet if he learned how to make the coffee, and perhaps how i like mine, since i've done the same for him. he's never made me a cup/pot, and if i'm not home to make his for him, he'll complain and be sad. i told him he should learn to do it himself and he said he likes me to do it. which i find irritating and childlike.

and yes, before you ask, i have at times just not done the thoughtful thing. for example, sometimes when he takes his nightly shower, i make a bedside water for each of us. not every night, but sometimes. the nights i haven't, he'll pout and ask why i didn't make him a water. one time i spoke honestly and said ""i was hoping maybe you could make us the waters tonight?"". i thought maybe it would motivate him to do it sometimes. but no, instead he told me i made him feel like shit with what i said. he said he's tired from work and really didn't need me to make him feel bad. and now he just makes himself a water. he doesn't make me one, and never has. like i said before, it's such a small gesture that can go so far.

every single time he asks me to do something for him now, which is constantly, i always want to scream WHAT DO YOU DO FOR ME? and then i feel like shit because he does financially support us. and then i feel like more shit because regardless of that, i'm still desperate to be thought of in other ways than financially. i've asked endlessly for flowers. i love flowers. he drives around the city all day for work and cant find the time to stop somewhere on the way home to get his wife flowers? it just hurts my feelings really bad. the last time i asked, he said i need to let him do thoughtful things without asking. so i stopped asking, but he doesn't do anything!!

when you read advice about communication in a marriage, it's often frowned upon to bring up things you do/don't do, when discussing an issue with your spouse. but i really wish i could do just that. i want to list out to him all the little, perhaps often invisible, things i do for him and our family every single day.  i always have to clean up after him. if i don't, it only hurts me because now i have to look at a mess i don't want to deal with + if i say hey can you clean this up he acts like i'm putting him out. and then if i tell him i hate how it seems like i'm putting him out, he fusses at me to stop trying to start a fight. and on top of those things, he asks me to do a million other things.

the only time he makes me feel thought of is my birthday and christmas, he's fine at those. but every other day of the year i feel like his maid/chef/whatever. i feel like a fucking nag all the time asking him to clean up after himself or show even the bare minimum amount of effort. i'll get him a treat or something when i leave the house. i'll make something he loves for dinner. i'll get that thing he needed at the store. but no one thinks of me. the once in a lifetime he does something even the bare minimum, he expects praise.

the other issue - aside from never doing thoughtful things, he also actively does things that give me more work to do. like every night we have dinner, we use cloth napkins. every single night, he leaves his dirty napkin out for me to clean up, usually on the floor. he has severe ocd, which i'm not going to explain too far in detail. but whenever something falls on the floor, a phone or charger or tv remote, it needs to be wiped off. well if he touches the thing, now he has to wash his hands, which he doesn't want to do, so he asks me to wipe the thing. he constantly leaves trash surrounding the can in the bathroom, but because he doesn't want to put his hand near the toilet, those things stay on the floor until i pick them up. he's constantly washing his hands, which makes us go through hand towels like crazy. when he has soaked a towel up, he just tosses it on the floor. but remember, he won't pick it up because then he'd have to wash his hands again.

resentment has absolutely brewed because this is how the days go: i take care of our kid all day, then he comes home and i take care of him, and then he asks me to do even more things, and if i don't want to, he makes me feel bad, and then i feel like no one has thought of me. he has used his job as an excuse for a lot of things, but when i worked full time i was still somehow able to think of him and what would make him happy. or at the very least try to avoid doing things that make his life harder. 

i have brought this issue up a few times briefly in the past, like during an incident where it was relevant. what i want to do now is give it a last hurrah, and sit him down and explain to him directly how serious this issue is to me. i need him to be more thoughtful, i need him to at least try to be considerate and think of all the shit i already do. his behavior has actively made me feel unloved. like it is very seriously affecting my happiness in our marriage.

he's verbally affectionate, always telling me how perfect and wonderful i am and how much he loves me. but i need his actions to show me, too. and his actions have made me feel very unloved for a long time. like this will seriously only affected our marriage more and more negatively as time goes on, and i need him to understand the weight of it. i realize this issue has changed me as a person as well, which makes me feel depressed. i have stopped doing nice things for him sometimes because i know he won't appreciate it, reciprocate it, or he'll just ask for more from me. it's completely deflated me.

i'm looking for advice on the exact language i can use to have this conversation, perhaps even some resources to try to get through his thick skull. he gets defensive about shit and tells me i make him feel like he can't do anything right and then i feel discouraged from ever talking about my feelings and i know that's not good, so i need some support from strangers. thanks for reading.

ps. yes i'm looking into therapy for myself. i brought up marriage counselling and he doesn't want to go. maybe this would be a good push to get him to be open to it.",2,1761005409.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

I just moved to Canada a few months ago.

I used to work as a fashion designer in my country, and I‚Äôm currently looking for a similar position here.   
But honestly, it‚Äôs been quite challenging, so I‚Äòd love to get some advice on how to prepare or improve my chances. 

  
I studied fashion design for about six years and also earned a master‚Äôs degree ‚Äî I‚Äôm wondering if that could be an advantage here.   
I have around four years of experience as a designer in my home country. English isn‚Äôt my native language, but I can manage conversations. Most importantly, I already have a work permit, so I don‚Äôt need any visa sponsorship for now. 

A few days ago, a friend told me that it might‚Äôve been easier if I had graduated from a Canadian university ‚Äî and it made me wonder if I should study here again. üòÖ

  
So far, I‚Äôve applied to several Canadian companies and even had an interview with one HR team. (but I couldn‚Äôt move forward in the process..)   
I also tried sending cold emails and LinkedIn messages for coffee chat with designers I admire ‚Äî but haven‚Äôt received any replies yet üòÇ Is that considered bad behavior or something?

So, for someone who‚Äôs a fashion designer from another country, what should I focus on or work on to find a job in Canada?    
I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice!

College grad, fluent in English, Sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits (because nothing says ‚Äúthrilling drama‚Äù like corporate loopholes) and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who‚Äôs the real master chef.

I don‚Äôt drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, then yes, I‚Äôm basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less ‚Äúclubbing till 2am‚Äù and more ‚Äúbuilding a pillow fort empire and bingeing Netflix until the cliffhanger leaves me emotionally bankrupt.‚Äù Basically, I‚Äôm a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

Also worth mentioning, I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that‚Äôs a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You‚Äôre in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use ‚Äúthere,‚Äù ‚Äútheir,‚Äù and ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that‚Äôs more than just ‚Äúhey‚Äù (plot twist: you‚Äôre actually interesting). You‚Äôre the type to send random memes that perfectly capture the chaos of life because sometimes a well-timed GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don‚Äôt smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. If you‚Äôre thoughtful, communicative, and the type who remembers the small things (like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog), we‚Äôll get along just fine.

What if clearing a single surface could give you back your evenings ‚Äî and your inner quiet?

I‚Äôm¬†**JohnRoss**, a Dallas designer who crafts soulful interiors ‚Äî spaces that don‚Äôt just look good, but¬†*feel*¬†like a deep exhale.  
Not square footage... but¬†**soul square footage**.

# The Surface Rule (Born from Burnout)

Two years ago, I was fried.  
Four projects, late-night calls, and my 900-sq-ft house felt like a cage.  
Counters drowning in sketches and mugs. Coffee table buried in mail.  
Nightstand? A charger snarl and design mags I‚Äôd never finish.

I‚Äôd stumble home after 14 hours, pour a drink, and scroll into oblivion.  
My home wasn‚Äôt recharging me ‚Äî it was the fifth meeting of the day.

Then the thought hit me:  
**What if my space was stealing my soul because every surface screamed ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù?**

Desperation birthed¬†*The Surface Rule*:

>I started with my kitchen island one slow Saturday morning.  
Cleared it to a wooden cutting board.  
Stared at the empty quartz.  
Exhaled.  
Smiled, even.  
Because in that blank canvas, I found room to be.  
Not produce ‚Äî just¬†*breathe.*

# The Soul Work: Why Surfaces Are Your Mind‚Äôs Mirror

Interiors, to me, are¬†**inner-life architecture**.

We spend most of our time at home with our eyes on surfaces ‚Äî counters, tables, shelves ‚Äî and what we see there shapes how we feel.  
Cluttered? It‚Äôs a whisper of unfinished business.  
Clear? It‚Äôs a quiet invitation to focus.

Neuroscience even backs it up:  
Visual mess spikes cortisol and fogs your focus.

Here‚Äôs my philosophy:  
**Space isn‚Äôt absence ‚Äî it‚Äôs intention.**

That bare island turned rushed coffee into ritual.  
Steam curling. First sip. Silence.  
No more bumping into piles. Only peace.

Cleared coffee table (now only a plant)?  
I sketch there again ‚Äî ideas flowing like they hadn‚Äôt in months.  
Nightstand to lamp-only? No doom-scrolling, just deeper sleep.

Homes aren‚Äôt backgrounds; they‚Äôre¬†**co-conspirators**¬†in your peace.  
Clear surfaces are the first step to a life that breathes.

# How I Live It (Messy Truth, No Fluff)

**Gut-Check Purge:**  
Trash bag ready, room by room.  
Touch every surface item: ‚ÄúDo I use this here daily?‚Äù  
No? Drawer, shelf, donate.  
*(Four bags out ‚Äî emotional weight lifted.)*

**Sneaky, Soulful Storage:**  
Keys + mail in a hidden entry console drawer.  
Essentials off-surface, still within reach.  
Negative space = breathing room.

**One Anchor, Deep Meaning:**

* Kitchen island ‚Üí Cutting board (nourishment).
* Coffee table ‚Üí Single- plant (pause for beauty).
* Nightstand ‚Üí Lamp (rest as sacred).
* Console ‚Üí Framed skyline print (home‚Äôs quiet welcome).

**Nightly Ritual:**  
2 minutes to reset while unwinding.  
Touch, store, done.  
Sticky note on the fridge: ‚Äú**Surfaces = Sanctuary.**‚Äù  
My whisper back to calm.

**Pitfall Fix:**  
‚ÄúBut my charger!‚Äù Cord clips underneath ‚Äî hidden, yet handy.  
Peace intact.

# The Quiet Glow-Up (And What It Could Do for You)

One month in, my home hummed again.  
Friends walked in and said: ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you make this so... serene?‚Äù

I hosted my first dinner party in years ‚Äî the cleared table¬†*begged*¬†for wine and real talk.  
Best client pitch? Born from a quiet sketch session.  
That door-knot anxiety? Gone.

Evenings are mine again. The world fades. I recharge.

# Try This One Evening

If one surface shifted me ‚Äî a designer obsessed with the soul of space ‚Äî  
imagine what it could do for¬†*you.*

Pick one surface soon  
Clear it to one intentional item.  
Live with it for 3 days.  
Then come back and tell me what changed ‚Äî I‚Äôll help you tweak your setup if you want a designer‚Äôs eye.

**TL;DR:**¬†Bare surfaces to one intentional anchor max.  
Philosophy: Space = Soul space.  
Start small, reclaim your quiet.

long story short-i had to flee from california for an emergency and i had my flight paid for, but the flight that was bought for me didnt allow more than one small carry-on, and i didnt have enough money to change the flight - so i only took a small day pack with me. my way back that was promised was canceled on me, so i have to make my way back west on foot, while a lot all of my gear that i couldnt take on the plane, is still in california. i also discovered that it‚Äôs way more expensive for me to ship it all than for me to get it replaced secondhand:( so. i‚Äôm slowly but surely getting everything back together again for my venture out west - but i definitely miss having my flute and my ukulele to make money, as opposed to just flying signs. 

on the bright side, ive been traveling extra light with my two road dogs - which makes getting on trains, and hiding on trains, a lot easier.. hoping to find a good pack off marketplace so i can avoid carrying my sleeping bag (i feel so silly with this little bag that i cant clip shit onto!) if anyone has any recs for any specific ones, lmk, because i honestly dont know too much about how much better some of the brands are, vs other brands. i plan on flying a sign outside a sports/outdoors store. when i get to the next town i am going to tomorrow.. so hopefully, i can at least get a tarp for these cold rainy and humid nights out here!

people here in the midwest have been so kind and generous to me. i‚Äôve gotten half of the gear that i need in just the last couple of weeks, and i‚Äôve already hitched and rode trains across six different states (technically been to eight, in the past three weeks lol) so i‚Äôm making miles fs! this lady housed me and my road dogs up last night and we were able to shower (first time in a month LOL) do laundry (first time in two months) eat hot food, and sleep on her couches. she even bought me coffee, and bought my two friends booze. i got a house up from another traveler mom waiting for me in the next town, but after that + after i get all my gear sorted out again, i‚Äôm making my way back west. i can‚Äôt believe i already have gotten most of what i need replaced. i can‚Äôt wait to have all of the finishing pieces again so i can sleep more comfortably out here, clip stuff onto a real pack, and carry more stuff on me!

In the beginning things felt easy and fun, but lately I‚Äôm starting to notice a pattern that‚Äôs making me question whether we‚Äôre actually compatible in how we show up for each other.

For context: I make about 3x more than he does (maybe more). Money was never a big deal to me, so I‚Äôve been paying for most things ‚Äî groceries, meals, outings, Ubers, etc when we are together. I didn‚Äôt mind it at first because I thought it would balance out later or he‚Äôd show appreciation in other ways.

Recently though, we both lost our jobs (he first, then me), and instead of feeling like we‚Äôre supporting each other through it, I‚Äôve started to feel like I‚Äôm carrying him.

Some small examples that add up:

- This morning I took us to get coffee and a morning bun. I paid, and he ended up eating more than half. When I reached for another bite, he said, ‚ÄúWe should‚Äôve gotten two,‚Äù but didn‚Äôt offer to get anything or seem to notice that I barely had any.
- he asked me to book an uber for him without a pls in his text and despite saying I‚Äôll pay back hasn‚Äôt yet
- he spends money on himself very sparingly but with me he is very cheap, like he just spend $25 on take out lunch but when he bought kiwi at my apartment he made sure he took it back home instead of leaving for me
- he made eggs for us and asked how many I wanted I said 2 and he wanted 2 as well, when the eggs were made I looked at his plate vs mine, I had literally half of what he had. 
- didn‚Äôt even buy milk when I went to his apartment and he knew I was coming, I got him a French press to make coffee and he couldn‚Äôt be bothered to get milk 
- I bought him shirt and things from j crew so he can have good things to wear too when we go out, he hasn‚Äôt gotten me even flowers as a thank you. 

I don‚Äôt understand why he acts so poor about food when he spends money on himself like it‚Äôs nothing. 

He often jokes about money or responsibilities, but doesn‚Äôt seem to take them seriously. It‚Äôs like he lives in a world where someone else will handle it. They‚Äôre not huge issues individually, but together it feels like emotional immaturity and lack of consideration. I‚Äôve tried to brush it off, but now I feel uneasy even being around him ‚Äî like he just doesn‚Äôt get me or what partnership means.


I‚Äôm torn between thinking I‚Äôm overreacting because of stress (we‚Äôre both unemployed right now), or finally recognizing that he‚Äôs not capable of being the kind of partner I need ‚Äî thoughtful, emotionally aware, and dependable.

Has anyone dealt with this kind of slow realization? I want to break up with him. ",2,1761004291.0,AmIOverreacting,7,1.0,False

My wife was in the bathroom about 15ft away brushing her teeth. I heard a very loud thud. I ran into the bathroom to find my wife on the floor gasping for air and unresponsive in almost every other way. Her eyes were open and she was struggling for breath, but she couldn't move her limbs and couldn't respond. I called 911 and somewhere in the call she stopped breathing completely but her heart was still beating. I gave mouth to mouth a few times and she started breathing again. The ambulance came and kept her breathing on the way to the hospital. She ended up being air lifted to another hospital about 100 miles away, intubated and sedated along the way.

The doctors told us when we got there a few hours later that she had likely suffered an aneurysm rupture. They needed to do an angiogram to find it and confirm. They had a plan to fix it. 3 days later they did a procedure to fix it. But they told us that with brain aneurysms, the trouble comes 5 days later. The brain starts to spasm and the blood vessels close up causing potential brain damage.

After the initial procedure to fix the aneurysm, everything went well and that evening they were trying to take her off the ventilator. She was awake and lucid, responding to commands, giving thumbs up, blinking etc. Later that night she ended up pulling her own vent tube out. I woke up to the ventilator alarm going off and looked over at her smiling at me and waving. She eventually started talking. All good news. She was heavily drugged, so not everything made sense but I could tell she was in there.

By the end of the next day, she wasn't breathing on her own very well any more. In the evening we watched part of footloose on the TV, she knew the movie and the names of the actors. I fell asleep. When I woke up, it was one of her doctors waking me up to tell me they had to put her back on the ventilator and that I needed to leave the room. I went to her bedside and told her I had to step out and that I'd see her later. She said ""come cuddle with me"". Something she always said before. I said, ""I can't right now baby, but we'll cuddle soon. I love you"". She said, I love you too. These were the last words we spoke to each other.

From that point, things got progressively worse because the spasms in her brain eventually caused swelling that injured her spinal cord. In the end, I had to make the decision that her life wouldn't continue because it wouldn't be worth living. After 10 days in the ICU, we took her off the ventilator and she never took another breath. She passed within a few minutes and I have been such a mess ever since. We didn't have kids.

I've had a few ""okay"" days since, but it's mostly all bad and I'm finding new lows every day. I don't know how to handle this.",22,1761004059.0,GriefSupport,3,1.0,False

Overall, this thing has held up incredibly well and still feels as premium as when I first set it up.

**The Good**

- Build quality:
Easily the most solid desk I‚Äôve ever owned. It feels rock steady, even with a heavy setup on top. Nothing wobbles or creaks, and the overall structure feels like it could last for many years.

- Tabletop:
The tabletop has a really nice, polished finish. It‚Äôs smooth, durable, and doesn‚Äôt feel cheap at all. I‚Äôve spilled coffee, written directly on it, and done all kinds of work on it with minimal wear showing. Obviously, make sure you take care of it too, it's not titanium. Clean and protect it regularly.

- Motors:
The motors are still running like day one: quiet, smooth, and consistent. I haven‚Äôt experienced a single issue or slowdown after almost a year of daily adjustments.

- Safety mechanism:
A few times I had boxes or random stuff under the desk when raising or lowering it, and the safety sensor caught it immediately. It stopped moving the second it felt resistance, which is really reassuring.

- Weight handling:
At one point, I had three monitors, a full-sized gaming desktop, two laptops (a MacBook Pro and my work laptop), plus a few books stacked on top. The desk still went up and down with zero hesitation. That alone says a lot about how strong the frame and motors are.

- Stability:
I‚Äôm very picky about wobble, and this desk passed the test. When it‚Äôs at its maximum height, there‚Äôs a slight bit of movement if you really try to shake it, but that‚Äôs normal for any standing desk. For regular use, it feels solid and stable even when typing or leaning slightly.

- Design and feel:
It has a very professional, clean look that fits perfectly in a work-from-home setup. Sitting or standing at it just feels nice. It has a cozy yet productive vibe, which makes it easier to get into work mode.

- Memory presets:
One of those features you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll need until you have it. I originally thought I‚Äôd be fine just holding the button until it reached the right height, but that gets annoying really fast. With the memory settings, you just press one button and it adjusts exactly where you want it, super convenient if you switch between sitting and standing a lot.

**The Bad**

- Size and footprint:
I went all out and bought the largest version with the widest tabletop, and it‚Äôs big. It looks amazing and gives tons of workspace, but it‚Äôs also very intrusive. I‚Äôm moving soon, and figuring out where to put it in a new place is honestly giving me a bit of stress. If you‚Äôre short on space, definitely consider one of the smaller sizes. I might look into whether it‚Äôs possible to resize it or get a smaller tabletop later on.

- Seated ergonomics (personal issue):
When I sit, I tend to lean back quite a bit, and sometimes it makes it hard to see my screen clearly. I do have mild myopia, so this is partly on me for not wearing my glasses, but if you also struggle with seeing things from a bit of a distance, just keep in mind that monitor positioning can be tricky depending on how you sit.

- Cable management:
I bought the under-desk cable tray, which is fantastic and keeps things clean. But if you‚Äôre relying only on the included elastic straps or fabric loops, you‚Äôll probably find they can‚Äôt handle a heavier setup with lots of cables. You‚Äôll either end up with cables hanging down or running out of space. The tray is definitely worth getting. I also argue that it's not that big either, so if you have a lot of cables, make sure you take that into consideration.

**Overall Thoughts**

After nearly a year, the Odin standing desk has completely lived up to my expectations. It‚Äôs sturdy, quiet, looks great, and feels premium every single day. The motors are as smooth as ever, and the overall build feels like it could easily last several more years without any issues.

It‚Äôs not a cheap desk, but you absolutely get what you pay for. If you care about stability, reliability, and having a professional-looking setup that makes it enjoyable to work or game at, the Odin is a fantastic choice. Just make sure you have enough space if you‚Äôre going for the largest version, it‚Äôs a beast.",2,1761003750.0,FlexiSpot_Official,1,1.0,False

My obsessive tendencies send me down endless rabbit holes, so I only made this account to meet people for the sake of my sanity.

I‚Äôm a Middle Eastern American, born in California but raised in Jordan after my family moved back when I was a baby. I‚Äôve visited the U.S. a few times and have family in California, New Jersey, and Texas.

I recently graduated with a degree in Nutrition and Dietetics. Right now I‚Äôm in that weird post-grad phase, applying for scholarships, exploring career options, and questioning my entire existence üòá.

Personality-wise, I‚Äôm quiet, calm, and introverted. I have a hard time socializing and making friends. Some would describe me as living in my own world, always zoned out and lost in thought. I have a wild imagination and at night I sit with my dog and make up bedtime stories for him about the neighborhood pets. I think he enjoys it. I love reading and baking. I make the best chocolate chip cookies and pecan pie, but don‚Äôt expect any Middle Eastern recipes from me. My family says my taste buds are whitewashed, I say I‚Äôm just a picky eater. I‚Äôm a huge fan of true crime, history shows, documentaries, and baking competitions. Random fun facts: I‚Äôm a triplet, I hate coffee, and I‚Äôm addicted to Diet Coke.

I‚Äôm agnostic and open-minded. I‚Äôve explored many beliefs but always come back to the idea that a loving god wouldn‚Äôt punish anyone for being confused. I‚Äôm also left leaning and not a big fan of conservatives.

Appearance-wise, when I was younger I cared too much about looks and fell into society‚Äôs beauty standards. It just left me starving myself and depressed. Now I‚Äôm more confident and comfortable in my own skin. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm average looking. I‚Äôm white I have brown wavy shoulder-length hair, brown eyes, and a baby face. I‚Äôm 155 cm and 70 kg. These days I dress comfortably and don‚Äôt wear much makeup unless I‚Äôm in the mood or it‚Äôs a special occasion.

What I‚Äôm looking for:
I‚Äôm hoping for a long-distance relationship that starts with chatting, photo-sharing, and maybe FaceTime later on. If we fall in love, I‚Äôm open to meeting and relocating. I‚Äôm drawn to kind, emotionally open people (23‚Äì29) who want a genuine and loving connection, not something superficial. Shared interests are a plus but not necessary. Looks aren‚Äôt very important to me. I do get the ick from certain beard and hair styles, but I guess it‚Äôs just hair at the end of the day lol. 

For honesty‚Äôs sake, here are some of my red flags: I‚Äôm needy and not very good at controlling my emotions, though I‚Äôm working on improving that. I also have depression and OCD, which can get bad sometimes, but my medications keep them mostly under control.

Thank you for reading I won‚Äôt be replying to anyone who hasn‚Äôt read the whole post so if you got here send me a üåû

1obxigf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1obxigf/10_nobs_rules_that_made_my_life_stupidly/,10 no-BS rules that made my life stupidly DISCIPLINED (even though I used to suck at it),"Been noticing a pattern lately. Everyone‚Äôs obsessed with ‚Äúdiscipline‚Äù online. Clean girl routines. 5 AM club. Dopamine detoxing. But somehow, most of us still feel messy, distracted, and out of control. Even the most aesthetic Notion template won‚Äôt fix it. 

Let‚Äôs be real. A lot of discipline content on TikTok and IG is just hot people giving bad advice. Half of it‚Äôs performative. The other half is just recycled hustle porn. So after diving deep into actual science from books, psychology research, podcasts, and expert interviews, here‚Äôs a real, no-fluff guide to living a more disciplined life. These 10 rules are simple. But they hit hard. 

Let‚Äôs go.

**1. Build identity-based discipline**

James Clear (author of ""Atomic Habits"") explains this best. Most people focus on goals. But habits stick when they‚Äôre part of who you are. Don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI want to be disciplined.‚Äù Say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the kind of person who does hard things even when I don‚Äôt feel like it.‚Äù

- Identity > Outcome
- Small wins reinforce identity
- Discipline becomes automatic over time

**2. Use ‚Äúimplementation intention‚Äù for every task**

Psychologist Peter Gollwitzer‚Äôs research shows that saying ‚ÄúI will work out‚Äù is less effective than ‚ÄúI will work out at 7 AM in my garage after coffee.‚Äù Be hyper-specific. Time, place, cue. Plan in advance. That‚Äôs how elite athletes build consistency.

**3. Don‚Äôt trust motivation, trust ENVIRONMENT**

Stanford behavior scientist BJ Fogg says environment matters more than willpower. Want to read more? Put books beside your mouse. Want to sleep earlier? Install red light bulbs. Design your space to make the right thing the easy thing.

**4. Decision fatigue is killing your focus**

Barack Obama wore the same suit every day. Steve Jobs did the same with his turtleneck. The point? Fewer decisions = more mental energy for things that matter. Pre-decide meals, outfits, workouts. Your brain will thank you.

**5. Dopamine timing > dopamine detox**

Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist at Stanford) explains that delaying gratification increases dopamine spikes. So instead of scrolling after every task, push rewards to the END of your deep work block. This wires your brain to crave effort, not just outcome.

**6. Grit beats talent 10 times out of 10**

Angela Duckworth‚Äôs research in her book ‚ÄúGrit‚Äù found that the most successful people aren‚Äôt the smartest. They‚Äôre the ones who show up daily. They practice longer. Fail more. Quit less. Talent‚Äôs overhyped. Discipline scales better.

**7. Track your life like a scientist**

Data = awareness. Awareness = control. Use habit trackers. Mood logs. Time audits. Don‚Äôt just ‚Äútry to be better.‚Äù Measure it. You don‚Äôt need to be perfect. You just need to be honest.

**8. Create friction for bad habits**

Want to stop doomscrolling? Log out. Delete the app. Make it annoying to use. Behavioral economists like Dan Ariely say increasing friction can break even the strongest habits. Make bad habits feel like effort.

**9. Master the ‚Äútwo-minute rule‚Äù**

From David Allen‚Äôs ‚ÄúGetting Things Done.‚Äù If a task takes under 2 minutes, do it now. Don‚Äôt reschedule it. Don‚Äôt add it to your planner. Just execute. Discipline isn‚Äôt about big things. It‚Äôs about not avoiding tiny things.

**10. Don‚Äôt miss twice**

Discipline isn‚Äôt perfection. It‚Äôs pattern recognition. James Clear again: ‚ÄúMissing one day is a mistake. Missing two is the start of a new habit.‚Äù Always restart before the slip becomes a slide.

---

Here are some insanely good resources that back all this up and will help you go deeper:

- **Atomic Habits by James Clear**  
  Over 10 million copies sold, NYT bestseller, probably the most quoted book in productivity circles for good reason. James breaks down how small behavior shifts rewire your identity. It helped me stop chasing motivation and start stacking wins. This is the best habit book ever written.

- **Grit by Angela Duckworth**  
  A MacArthur Genius Grant winner, psychology professor at Penn. This book made me rethink talent completely. It shows discipline outperforms IQ, wealth, and privilege. If you‚Äôve ever felt ‚Äúnot good enough,‚Äù this book will destroy that lie.

- **Deep Work by Cal Newport**  
  MIT-trained computer scientist who lives like a monk. Cal shows how to carve out deep, undistracted time in a world of chaos. If you feel like your brain has 20 tabs open, this will change your work forever. Best book on focus I‚Äôve read.

- **The Huberman Lab Podcast**  
  Hosted by Stanford neurobiologist Andrew Huberman. He explains the science behind dopamine, attention, sleep, and discipline in real language. Check out the episodes on ‚ÄúHow to increase motivation‚Äù and ‚ÄúTools to improve focus.‚Äù They‚Äôre ridiculously useful.

- **The Tim Ferriss Show (Ep: Jocko Willink)**  
  Jocko is a former Navy SEAL turned discipline philosopher. His take? Discipline equals freedom. If that sounds cheesy, this convo will change your mind. His morning routine is intense but practical.

- **Matt D'Avella on YouTube**  
  Minimalist filmmaker who explores habits, discipline, and productivity. His ‚Äú30 day challenges‚Äù are worth copying. One of the few YouTubers who doesn‚Äôt feel fake or overhyped. Everything‚Äôs calm, clean, and doable.

- **BeFreed**  
  One of the easiest ways to build discipline through learning. It‚Äôs an AI-powered app built by a Columbia University team that turns the best books, expert talks, and success stories into custom podcast lessons based on your goals. You can choose the tone, voice, and even the length (10, 20, or 40 min). It learns from what you listen to and builds your own adaptive learning roadmap. Plus, it‚Äôs already packed with content on time management, focus, grit, and all the books I mentioned above. Game changer for those who want smarter scroll-time.

- **Streaks App**  
  This is a clean, no-fluff habit tracker that makes your progress visual. Start small, hit streaks, and feel momentum. Works great for simple daily rules. The dopamine hit is real.

- **The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson**  
  Not as famous, but this book explains why people who do boring things daily end up with extraordinary lives. A great mindset reset if you feel stuck or inconsistent.

You don‚Äôt need to wake up at 5 AM or journal while staring at a candle for 45 minutes. You just need simple, science-backed systems. Discipline is a skill, not a personality trait. It‚Äôs trainable. And way more attainable than social media makes it seem.",1,1761003508.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

I want to go to church for the structure and community, but I don‚Äôt believe the Book of Mormon is ‚Äúanother testament of Jesus Christ‚Äù.
I was born into and grew up in the church but i suffered mild bouts of religious psychosis all throughout my childhood (once putting me into the hospital in high school).
I believe there is good that comes out of the church and that is why I want to go back.
My life is very unconventional for a typical Mormon and I know that. I don‚Äôt necessarily want to change that. I swear, I drink coffee, I will occasionally drink or smoke- and these aren‚Äôt things I plan on changing- not for a religion that I don‚Äôt believe is true at least.
With that being said, I know my beliefs in the church will not change. No I do not believe in the Holy Ghost, no I do not believe that keeping sacred covenants will change the outcome of my afterlife experience and I do not believe that the Book of Mormon is true. 
Despite this, I want the community and I want the structure that being an LDS member provides. I also have other reasons to go through the temple (family expectations and I‚Äôm married now so i believe it could be a good opportunity to share this bonding experience with my parents and in laws.) 
I also want to add this, I do not believe in this religion because it has been and is bad for my mental health, but I don‚Äôt necessarily want to let go of the community. 
So, with all that being said is it disrespectful/wrong if I choose to go through the temple and get married in the temple? Or could it be looked over and understood.
Edit- guys I posted this in the latterdaysaints subreddit and it got taken down. I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter much anyways since I need level headed people to know and understand what I‚Äôm talking about lol. I get a lot of shit from friends and family about not being married in the temple etc. obviously I‚Äôd love to say fuck them and move on with my life but, practices and what I would consider tradition is important to them. Obviously I know what happens in the temple (I‚Äôve done my research) I just feel like this is something important to my family that I don‚Äôt feel like has to significantly change my life if I don‚Äôt want it to lol.",2,1761003507.0,exmormon,16,0.63,False
1obxiea,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1obxiea/am_i_stuck_up_or_this_is_normal/,Am I stuck up or this is normal?,"I‚Äôve been seeing my boyfriend for about 4 months (met on tinder). In the beginning things felt easy and fun, but lately I‚Äôm starting to notice a pattern that‚Äôs making me question whether we‚Äôre actually compatible in how we show up for each other.

For context: I make about 3x more than he does (maybe more). Money was never a big deal to me because he was very kind and sweet. I‚Äôve been paying for most things ‚Äî groceries, meals, outings, Ubers, etc when we are together. I didn‚Äôt mind it at first because I thought it would balance out later or he‚Äôd show appreciation in other ways.

Recently though, we both lost our jobs (he first, then me), and instead of feeling like we‚Äôre supporting each other through it, I‚Äôve started to feel like I‚Äôm carrying him. Some small examples that add up:

- This morning I took us to get coffee and a morning bun. I paid, and he ended up eating more than half. When I reached for another bite, he said, ‚ÄúWe should‚Äôve gotten two,‚Äù but didn‚Äôt offer to get anything or seem to notice that I barely had any. 
- he asked me to book an uber for him without a pls in his text and despite saying I‚Äôll pay back hasn‚Äôt yet
- he spends money on himself very sparingly but with me he is very cheap, like he just spend $25 on take out lunch but when he bought kiwi at my apartment he made sure he took it back home instead of leaving for me
- he went on a walk while I was doing interview prep and got himself coconut water on the walk, didn‚Äôt think of bringing even a small thing back for me (not that I expect) 

They‚Äôre not huge issues individually, but together it feels like emotional immaturity and lack of consideration. I‚Äôve tried to brush it off, but now I feel uneasy even being around him ‚Äî like he just doesn‚Äôt get me or what partnership means.

He comes from a divorced home so I wonder if he doesn‚Äôt know how to be selfless and love someone, all this feels very selfish to me. I always ask him if I can bring him anything when I‚Äôm going to his place, or check if he is hungry etc. 

I‚Äôm torn between thinking I‚Äôm overreacting because of stress (we‚Äôre both unemployed right now), or finally recognizing that he‚Äôs not capable of being the kind of partner I need ‚Äî thoughtful, emotionally aware, and dependable.

Has anyone dealt with this kind of slow realization? Am I also stuck up, like I‚Äôm used to a man being a caregiver so I don‚Äôt know if this guy not being that is how I would expect things to be?",1,1761003504.0,AskWomenOver30,1,1.0,False
1obxias,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1obxias/work_drama_when_your_hotel_life_starts_to_feel/,Work drama: When your hotel life starts to feel like a soap opera ‚Äî need advice!,"Alright, buckle up, this is a bit of a saga. I‚Äôve been in the hotel biz for about a decade now. Back in 2015, I started at a hotel that shared a parking lot with its ‚Äúsister‚Äù property. In the same month I was hired, another woman‚Äîlet‚Äôs call her Carla (45F)‚Äîwas hired at the sister hotel. Over the years, we both climbed the ladder to front office supervisors and occasionally crossed paths, mostly friendly hellos and the usual ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your shift?‚Äù chats.

Fast forward a few years: I‚Äôm assistant manager at my hotel, and Carla had stepped down back to a desk associate role at her place. Our two hotels started working more closely together under the same GM‚Äîthink joint holiday parties, staff mingling, the works. I met Carla‚Äôs husband Tim (45M), their two sons, her mom, her sister... basically the whole crew.

Eventually, Carla moved over to work at my hotel‚Äîright under my supervision‚Äîand even baked me Christmas cookies (which, FYI, instantly makes you a favorite). She met my kid, we became close-ish, and I trained her to be a front office supervisor/assistant manager. Tim often came by during Carla‚Äôs shifts. He‚Äôs a total people person‚Äîsuper friendly, the kind of guy who can chat about anything from the weather to why the coffee machine always breaks.

In early 2023, I got promoted to GM at another hotel in the company, while Carla stayed put. A couple months later, Tim asked if there were any front desk openings. Knowing he was great and seeing how sweet Carla was, I hired him‚Äîbecause hey, if the husband‚Äôs a good guy, that‚Äôs a win, right?

Now for the plot twist: Tim confided that he and Carla have been having some trouble‚Äîseparate bedrooms, her being distant, the classic ‚Äúwe‚Äôre having issues‚Äù stuff. Then this past weekend, I spot Tim out to dinner with Sally (28F), a coworker from Food & Beverage, and her family. When they noticed me waving, Tim looked like he‚Äôd seen a ghost and practically vanished.

Next thing I know, Tim texts me: ‚ÄúI bet that looked weird, huh?‚Äù He says he was just showing Sally‚Äôs family a good restaurant and asks me to keep it hush-hush. The very next day at work, Tim comes into my office and says Sally has been there for him when Carla hasn‚Äôt, and he‚Äôs been helping her out with some things. Then he asks if I think he‚Äôs giving off any ‚Äúmore than friends‚Äù vibes with Sally. I said no, but he asked again to keep this under wraps‚Äîespecially from the GM.

So here I am, feeling like I‚Äôm in a soap opera but without the luxury of commercial breaks. It sounds sketchy, and honestly, I feel for Carla because nobody deserves to be blindsided. But is it my place to say anything? Tim and Sally work 4-5 shifts together every week. Do I tell the GM, or just keep my head down and hope this all blows over?

What would you do? Because honestly, I‚Äôm torn between ‚Äúmind your business‚Äù and ‚Äúsomeone‚Äôs gotta say something.‚Äù",1,1761003497.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Just gonna keep this short and...less sentimental 

Rant after suggestion so expect a long post


1. Please allow us to swap armors and passives. I love my UF-84 but it's trash against bots id rather it had B-24s passive

Same with DP-53 I'm not the gambler type and like consistency, but only a traitor wouldn't think it's sexy ash. My AC-1 dutiful will forever sit on a shelf, why?   It looks dope asf but wtf am I gonna do with it's passives....not good enough for bugs....not good enough bots....sure as shit ain't squid worthy...I have so much armor just sitting in my armory collecting dust that I'd like to wear, but would hinder my play style severely.


I can deck out my plasma blasting rifle, but my armors on some baby back bitch shit. I'd also like to see the other armors more. Like the TR-40 Eagle armor. I'd love....and I mean I'd love to rock it, won't help me survive shit though and that's the issue.



2. I've come here before in the past expressing the hidden toxicity of the community. When I brought up the subtle racism I got hit with ""proof or it didn't happen) and as you can see I have yet to rejoin this community cause I'll be damned if I'm treated like shit because of my skin color (I mean it's not hard to guess by my voice) and I get hit with ""well how do we know it happened"". Yeah I took a long ass hiatus after that and mind you I became a diver before the creek got popular and used to be on HD every day coffee and blunt ready to the point to where HDers is rivaling my Red Dead time played at almost 2k hours. 

I'm glad we got reinforcements they were indeed needed, but mfers are way too happy to kick you and getting booted from the mission after 30 or so minutes ain't it chief cause that's 30 mins I could've spent playing anything else and the kicks be for the dumbest reasons. If this was a every now and then occurrence I wouldn't have shit to say but I dead ass just got kicked for typing ""ofc"" when the SL asked for me and the other dude not to leave since we called in the shuttle earlier and were defending it. I saved clip this time in case anyone want to call me a liar again. I've been kicked for my lvl in a high level mission, I've been kicked for ig ruining a low levels group infinite respawn on a high level mission, I've been kicked for my armor choice ffs (would see or hear comments about it before being back on my ship)


Now this is the type of diver I am. Running back to get your shit? No words needed I got your 6, spotted super rare samples while the shuttles inbound? You're not going alone. Got a horde trying to murder you while making your way? Well imma make my way and were about to drop some shit

I'm literally that type, and I'd be lying my ass off if I said I don't see how Gantz got to where he was. I love this game and enjoy it but the people can just be God awful trash. No making your own squad doesn't work for everyone a whole nother book for another day but I tried many times and I have my own issues with that as well, just know that it doesn't work out in my favor....ever

Like nawl bro wasting my time like that and hearing laughter as I respawn on ship ain't cool or funny, tking me then kicking me for no reason just cause you can, yeah no I said it before I'm saying it again there needs to a be consequence because there's nothing attractive about being kicked when youve tried to be nothing but helpful and you get fucked over in the end. If I wanted to play solo I wanted choose to play a multiplayer coop game. Like fr mfers need to start being more honest cause it's not that bad until it happens to you 

I'm not saying everyone's like this either I had a damn good squad this morning, nothing but team work, getting shit done, solid communication, mistakes being made, and shits and giggles coming in right after we had a damn good time

Just for me to get kicked for no reason before my pod even loads in, to getting kicked for AGREEING NOT TO LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND that's the second time today I've gotten kicked like that and the last few times weren't any better

Y'all real deal have to do something about this ts is not cool at all.



Lastly, PS5 has been experiencing demoralizing crashes. You find a good squad, y'all are halfway through and then blue screen. You join back, everyones holding off extract and right before it touch the ground you blue screen again. I've had a lot of moments where I would rather be on HDers but knowing that my shit has to blue screen twice before I'm actually good to play the game isn't going to work tbh. After the second time I'm ready to hang up my helmet for the day because it always comes at the most inconvenient time.




Rant/suggestions over all I had to say because I feel like someone had to

Also I forgot, please update and buff THE ONLY LEGENDARY WAR BOND we have im ngl the armors only good for looks and noobs nothing it gives you is worth it. My armor being quiet will only help against....no faction if 1 see you they all see you

Leg injuries don't really happen much it's why democracy protects is always under scrutiny at times. I can count on one hand how many times my legs have been injured....I die before that happen so yet again....not worth it....players that know better use their eyes and their map so that range increase....doesn't actually help anything for experienced players... your eyes and your map will help you with that more than the armor will

The assault rifle should be way better than it is, 32 rounds 80 DMG per round...nah I'll keep my plasma 2 piecer, yeah it can kill me, but at least whatever kills me is coming with me unless it's heavy armor

That smg....why is there only 1 med armor pen smg.....why....yeah I get team comps are a thing but....I don't like seeing a walker and having to play ring around the Rosie's like it's malevelon and we have divers teleporting around the map, I have grenades that do the work for me come tf one that smg wouldn't even tickle the covenant. Rest of the weapons aren't any different or better literally you have better options from other warbonds that'll do you much more justice


Lastly, that green is fucking hideous I get it...Master Chief...but come on man add some decals to that shit or something ffs it's just plain ass green....let's see...black and red, blue and gold, jungle camo, hazard paint, and flames of freedom etc....then you have this shit


Like nawl fam it's the most expensive warbond in the game rn and everything in it is below par. Sure it looks good, but ANYTHING OF ITS TYPE FROM ANOTHER WARBOND WOULD BE BETTER 


I'm not okay this and feel like too many are choosing to smile and play nice cause ""oooo Xbox crossover"" be honest, how many vets you see using the shit that's not on YouTube or social media? Every one above lvl 100 myself included.....yeah no I have seen not one using any of it not even the paint....new players though....yep plenty



For it to be the only Legendary and the most expensive it honestly should be better than what we got like I dead ass just got it to support the game and for the helmets....I don't wear any damn way

The blinds down the lights out  
The phone rings God help me  
There's nobody home  
I crouch on the carpet  
Not breathing just being  
Like meat on the bone

I'm in a cozy booth  
Maybe my watch is fast  
Another Tanqueray  
I'll wait till twenty past  
I'm about to go postal when she waltzes in  
I guess she's a knockout‚Äîhey where have I been?

The waiter never comes  
God knows the service could be better  
Lunch with Gina is forever

Coffee and a kiss  
Maybe later maybe never  
Lunch with Gina...

Here‚Äôs a comprehensive **business analysis** of your caf√© performance based on the sales data ‚Äî along with visual insights üëá

# üèÜ 1. Product Performance

**Top items by total sales:**

* ü•á **Juice** leads with $19,157 in total sales.
* Salad, Sandwich, Smoothie, and Cake complete the top 5, together generating **the majority of revenue**.
* Lower performers: Coffee, Tea, and Cookie.

üìä **Insight:**

* The top 5 products dominate sales, indicating a **strong core product lineup**.
* There‚Äôs potential to either **upsell** or **bundle** lower-performing items (like cookies with coffee/tea) to boost their contribution.

# üè™ 2. Channel Performance (Location)

* **Takeaway sales**: $62,182.50 (‚âà 70% of total revenue).
* **In-store sales**: $27,174.00.

**Average transaction value**:

* In-store: $9.01
* Takeaway: $8.90

üìä **Insight:**

* Takeaway clearly drives **volume**, but in-store brings slightly **higher ticket value**.
* This suggests that dine-in customers are more likely to **buy premium or multiple items**, possibly desserts or drinks.

**üí° Suggestion:**

* Consider **promotions or upselling at takeaway**, e.g., ‚Äúadd a cookie for $1‚Äù to lift the average transaction value.
* Enhance **in-store experience** to retain high-value customers (loyalty program, combo deals, seasonal specials).

# üí≥ 3. Payment Method Trends

* **Digital Wallet** dominates with 5,469 transactions (54.7%).
* Credit Card and Cash are roughly equal at \~2,260 transactions each.

üìä **Insight:**

* The preference for digital wallet indicates a **tech-savvy customer base**.
* Faster checkout options may enhance customer experience further.

**üí° Suggestion:**

* Offer **exclusive digital payment incentives** (e.g., 5% cashback for digital wallet payments).
* Make sure the POS system is optimized for digital-first customers.

# üç∞ 4. Strategic Opportunities

* **Bundling & Upselling:** Boost underperforming items like cookies and tea through add-ons or combos.
* **Takeaway Revenue Optimization:** Even a **small increase in average spend** can yield significant growth due to high volume.
* **Loyalty Programs:** Target in-store customers for premium experiences and digital wallet users for repeat visits.
* **Seasonal Specials:** Highlight top performers (Juice, Salad) with limited-time offers to drive excitement.

# üìà 5. Summary Dashboard

My appetizers, which I shared with my beautiful wife who smells like sunshine or petrichor depending on her mood.

* Falafel (their tahini was legit)
* Deema Sausage (it reminded me of Chorizo)

Main courses:

* Sac Kavurma (Beef, spicy) - Me, almost licked the platter
* Tantuni Wrap Plate (Chicken) - She, took home some leftovers which I ate.

Dessert:  

* We both got the Baklava with Saffron ice cream. (they were out of the Dubai Chocolate Cheesecake when we went)

Also ordered: 

* Turkish Coffee x 2

As an accomplished eater of food, I was still pleasantly surprised by Deema.  The first time I found out about it was on a day where we went to the Twisted Vine to get some olive oil.  On the way into the Vine, I stopped in my tracks, because SOMETHING smelled really good.  I wasn't sure if it was Deema or Taj Mahal, so we just kind of sat on it for almost two years before finally going to try it out.

I liked it so much that I have requested that we go back for my birthday dinner.  My only complaint is that the coffee we got did not seem to be what I expected, it was very weak, and I wanted to almost chew it.  It was rescued by the saffron ice cream, which tasted like nothing I've ever had, was creamy and smooth.  Not too sweet, and I still can't put my finger on it.  I loved it almost as much as I love my beautiful wife, who can sing anything better than I can.

1obxf3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyai/comments/1obxf3i/my_honest_review_on_permanent_memory_and_the/,My honest review on permanent memory and the ultimate subscription.,"TLDR; Probably not going to pay for next month.

I subscribed to the Ultimate plan mainly for the Permanent Memory feature, and here are my honest thoughts after testing it for a week.
The Ultimate subscription itself improves bot narration a bit, conversations feel smoother and more immersive. That‚Äôs a win. But Permanent Memory? It‚Äôs a mixed bag and honestly more frustrating than helpful right now.
With simple stuff like character details (e.g., name, appearance, basic backstory), it stays pretty knowledgeable and doesn‚Äôt deviate too far. But events are where it falls apart:
‚Ä¢  Event Overwriting: If {char} and I go on a first date and it notes what happens, then we go on a second date, the memory often overwrites the first date‚Äôs notes with the second‚Äôs info. This traps you in loops like repeating ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù It‚Äôs even worse than Longer Memory (LM) mode.
‚Ä¢  Forgotten Details: It doesn‚Äôt jot down clothes in the event section. If I wear a black dress and change into a nightgown, a few messages later, I‚Äôm back in the black dress.
‚Ä¢  Location Confusion: If we walk from the house to a coffee shop, it notes it, but then it gets confused about the current event and suddenly we‚Äôre back at the house out of nowhere.
‚Ä¢  Repetitive Issues: If I cut my hand and it jots it down, instead of healing over time, it‚Äôs a non-stop ‚Äúoh no your hand!‚Äù loop.
I‚Äôve tried saying ‚Äú(look at the memory)‚Äù to refresh it, but that doesn‚Äôt work. I wish there was better continuity; it feels like it‚Äôs gotten worse overall. Anyone have tricks to make it better, like specific phrasing or resetting techniques?

Some context to make it easier: suppose, you have a coffee shop in the mall. The owner gives you the space to operate that shop inside the mall. Now, what if the owner 'can't' give you the space, for a whole week? That'll make you rightfully enraged. In situations like these, it's a wise decision to keep a separate branch of your shop outside the mall (if it costs 0 dollars to keep another branch intact). In the world of hosting, services like AWS literally give their users a mini-computer to run the website to show the world.

The thing is, the most popular supermarket in the ""world,"" the AWS US-East-1, had a bad incident. Note that half of the internet runs through this. People usually prefer to keep their shops there because of a lot of conveniences and the ease of, say, saving energy and electricity costs. Now, what if that supermarket goes to maintainence mode? It would be a disaster for many of the shopkeepers.

Unlike the real world, the online servers are a lot more volatile. You can open or shut down your laptop with ease, but you need to ensure a lot of things before opening or closing a shop. This makes my point even stronger.

The maintainence costs can fluctuate a bit, but using server-rerouting is the way to go.",3,1761002992.0,Pinterest,0,1.0,False

Part One ‚Äì Eye of the Deep
There are countless stars in the sky above us, an infinite expanse stretching farther than our eyes can reach. But the sea below? That‚Äôs the world we dream in... and sometimes, the world we drown in. The air out here smells like rust and salt, thick enough to choke on, yet somehow we breathe it every day. Still, we rarely notice it. The same way we rarely notice the stories slipping through the cracks beneath our boots. All questions I pondered as I sat at the edge of the rig, letting my legs dangle over open water. My lunch break was ending too fast, cut short by the familiar sound of steel-toed boots behind me. ‚ÄúJake,‚Äù a voice called rough as barnacles but edged with something softer. ‚ÄúBreak‚Äôs up. C‚Äômon, we got welding to do.‚Äù
That was Josh, my senior out here. Gruff man, more sea than skin. You could hear the ocean in his lungs when he spoke kind, but never soft. ‚ÄúAlright, I got it,‚Äù I replied, waving him off half-heartedly. But I stayed a moment longer, eyes on the sea. Something about it‚Ä¶ unsettled me. That feeling again. Like I was being watched.
If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned out here on the Oculus, it‚Äôs this: eyes never leave you. Not up here, not below. But this time felt different. The sea plays tricks on the mind, sure. You see things in the fog, in the ripples. Still, I swear I saw it clear as day.
A man in a rowboat. Rowing toward the rig.
 And behind him‚Ä¶ fog. Thick, rolling, like it was following him. That was enough for me. I stood and followed Josh back to the crew.
‚ÄúAye, good on you for finally joining us,‚Äù he said, spitting the words with his usual sarcastic charm.
Josh wasn‚Äôt alone. Blake and Gabe were already suiting up.
Blake was hard to miss tall, broad-shouldered, black hair slicked back from the ocean air. Always wore this big, toothy grin like life was one long joke. ‚ÄúYou see that bird earlier? Damn thing stole my sandwich right off the railing,‚Äù he chuckled, handing Gabe a tank.
Gabe just gave a small smirk, adjusting the strap on his suit. He was the youngest of us redhead, soft-spoken, still had that new-rig look in his eyes. ‚ÄúBird‚Äôs got better taste than you, apparently,‚Äù he mumbled, Irish accent weaving through the quiet.
We all laughed. Even me. But I still couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling the weight pressing on my chest, heavier than the gear we were hauling.
Time to suit up.
The diving suit was like a cage iron around your ribs, steel in your veins. The emblem on the chestplate, the one they all call The Eye of the Deep, stared blankly out into the sea. Corporate told us the Eye was protection. A symbol of safety. That in moments of danger, it would grant you sight clarity. Personally? I always thought it was a way to justify the weight they put on our backs.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be too down,‚Äù Blake said, clapping a hand on my shoulder and passing me the welding gear. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt afford more welders this time of year, so upper‚Äôll keep us real safe, yeah?‚Äù ‚ÄúBetter than summer break,‚Äù Gabe added, his voice muffled by the helmet. ‚ÄúNothing like brine in your lungs to remind you you‚Äôre alive.‚Äù
I managed a chuckle, but deep down, I felt off. Like something was just beneath the surface‚Äîwatching. Waiting. Still, we pushed on.
We climbed down the ladders into the water. The wind howled above, tossing the surface into chaos, but beneath the waves...
Silence.
Calm, eerie silence.
The deeper we went, the more unnatural it felt. The salt stung harder. The brine was too thick, like it clung to us. Then we reached the rig leg. Gabe started his weld, torch hissing like a serpent in the dark. Blake followed suit. I clicked mine on, sparks dancing in the deep.
Then-
I heard it.
A bell.
 Soft, distant.
 Like a fishing bell.
That made no sense. We were too deep. Equipment was humming in my ears, and yet there it was. Clear. I turned, expecting maybe a flicker of light, or movement.
Instead
 The light was gone.
Everything ahead of me gone. The rig leg vanished into the black. My torch, my glove ripped away like they were never there.
And the suit?
 Gone. I was in my break clothes again.
I looked up no diving helmet, no rig. Just sky. Pale, grey-blue. Clouds drifting slowly like nothing had happened.
And then I realized
 I was sitting in a rowboat.
Dry. Completely, impossibly dry.
The bell was louder now. Behind me. Ringing slow and steady. And there he was. A man sitting across from me.
His coat was ragged, soaked in salt. A fishing hat rested low over where his face should have been, but no matter how hard I looked‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt see it. There was no face.
 Or maybe there was something so other, my mind refused to grasp it.
And then-
 Without his lips moving, without a sound spoken aloud I heard it.
‚ÄúHello, Jake.‚Äù




Part Two ‚Äì Everywhere and Nowhere

The world didn‚Äôt return it slammed back into me.

Every sound, every breath, every piece of me crushed beneath a weight older than the ocean itself. My lungs screamed for air, my pulse thrashing like a netted fish. And then I saw him the man in the rowboat, the Ferryman.

Something deep inside me remembered. Something I had buried so far down, even the sea hadn‚Äôt found it yet.

‚ÄúW-what are you doing here?‚Äù I stammered, my voice breaking not the voice of a man, but of the child I once was, small and afraid.

He didn‚Äôt answer. He only lifted a trembling, salt-soaked hand and pointed.

The shore ahead bled into view gray sand slick with water that wasn‚Äôt water. The waves rolled black, veins of red pulsing through them like blood through ice. The horizon bent wrong, folding in on itself. And in that distortion, I felt it again the drowning dread that lived between dreams.

Then came the cold.

Water surged around me, rising past my waist, my chest then my throat. My lungs filled with brine, heavy and bitter. The world above turned to noise metal, shouting, the echo of my name

And suddenly, I was back.

Someone was dragging me upward. Voices tore through the ringing in my ears.

‚ÄúGot him pull!‚Äù Blake‚Äôs voice, panicked and strained.
‚ÄúCareful, careful! he‚Äôs slipping!‚Äù Gabe shouted back.
‚ÄúChrist, he‚Äôs heavier than the tank!‚Äù

Light split through the water as they hauled me up the ladder. I coughed, choking out salt and panic, until my body hit the deck with a wet thud. My chest burned, ribs screaming with every breath.

‚ÄúWhat the hell happened to him?‚Äù Blake‚Äôs voice cut through the static.

Josh was standing over me, his face pale beneath the grime. ‚ÄúI-I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he muttered, forcing calm into his words. ‚ÄúHe just blacked out. Must‚Äôve been a bad O‚ÇÇ feed or something.‚Äù

There was something in his tone that didn‚Äôt sit right. Too measured. Too rehearsed.

They carried me inside, to the small changing room smelled of oil, sweat, and rusted metal. I sank into the couch, coughing until I could breathe again. The fluorescent lights above buzzed like angry flies.

‚ÄúHey, hey look who‚Äôs finally back,‚Äù Blake said from the doorway, his usual grin replaced by worry. ‚ÄúTook you long enough, man. You trying to nap under pressure?‚Äù

Gabe chuckled softly, trying to lighten the air. ‚ÄúYeah, Jake, not all of us get paid overtime to drown.‚Äù

Their laughter was brittle, barely holding together.

Then Josh stepped in. His boots clicked against the tile. ‚ÄúWe finished the welds without you,‚Äù he said, voice steady again, though his eyes never left mine. ‚ÄúYou were out for almost three hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúThree hours‚Ä¶?‚Äù I whispered, still catching my breath. I didn‚Äôt even know why I said it why I felt guilty for it. But the apology came anyway. ‚ÄúI- I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

Gabe frowned. ‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt apologize, man. You nearly died down there.‚Äù

But I couldn‚Äôt stop. The words poured out of me like water through cracks. ‚ÄúI just I don‚Äôt know what happened. I heard bells and then‚Ä¶‚Äù

The ringing returned faintly, somewhere in the distance.

A hand settled on my shoulder Josh‚Äôs. Rough, but warm. ‚ÄúEasy,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúBreathe. You‚Äôre fine now. We all have our bad days out here.‚Äù

His voice softened, almost fatherly. The kind of tone that made you forget how cold the sea could be. Then, after a moment, he added:

‚ÄúYou know what they say‚Ä¶‚Äù

He paused, looking out toward the dark waves beyond the window.

‚ÄúThe Ferryman waits for no one.‚Äù
.
Part Three ‚Äì The Skiff

The night after it happened, the crew decided to hold a small celebration some half-hearted attempt to shake off what we‚Äôd seen, or almost seen. We drank, laughed, and pretended the ocean wasn‚Äôt still watching us through the windows. Eventually, the laughter faded, and we drifted back toward our dorms, boots clanging against the rusted grates.

The walk felt unreal. The air inside the rig was heavy with oil and brine, every breath burning like smoke. Above us, chains swayed from the ceiling thin silhouettes in the dim amber light. Each one clinked softly, reminding me of the ones I‚Äôd seen below the surface‚Ä¶ or maybe in that other place. The City of Screens, I‚Äôd called it once. A maze of metal and mirrors where the sky hung in chains.

I tried not to think about it.

Instead, I focused on dodging the bursts of steam that hissed from the cracked pipes, each one threatening to scald me back to reality. The last thing I needed was another workplace injury and another trip off the payroll.

When I finally reached my bunk, exhaustion hit like a wave. I collapsed onto the mattress, boots still on, eyes burning. You know that moment just before sleep when your mind drifts, and the world folds in on itself? That space between waking and nothing? That‚Äôs where it started.

Only this time‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt stop.

The sheets beneath me turned cold. The scent of detergent faded into salt. I blinked and the bed was gone. In its place was iron. Then water. Freezing, black water swallowing me whole.

I lurched upright, coughing, wiping the liquid from my face. It clung to my skin, thick as oil. It looked like water. It even smelled like water. But deep down, I knew better. My eyes were the only things I could trust now.

When I found my footing, I realized I was standing on a shoreline the same one the Ferryman had shown me. The same wrong horizon folding in on itself like a wound that refused to close.

A city loomed in the distance.

I moved toward it, step by step, the wet sand gripping my ankles like hands trying to drag me down. Or maybe that wasn‚Äôt sand at all. By the time I reached the outskirts, the shapes began to appear.

The people if you could call them that were waiting.

Their faces were warped, stretched into impossible forms. No eyes. No mouths. Just folds of skin that twisted like reflections on broken glass. Last time, I‚Äôd frozen. I‚Äôd let this place crush me beneath its weight.

Not this time.

When one of them reached for me, I swung. Instinct, fear, rage whatever it was, it drove me. My fist connected, sinking into its flesh or what I hoped was flesh. The sound was wet, soft, wrong. Like punching through Styrofoam soaked in rot. I felt the thing collapse beneath me, heard it hit the ground with a dull, sickening thud.

For a moment, everything was still. Then the others backed away, their shifting bodies trembling. They were hiding from me.

And for the first time since all this began, I felt something that wasn‚Äôt fear.

I could fight back.

I moved through the crooked streets like a ghost, the city bending around me walls warping, shadows whispering in languages that didn‚Äôt exist. Every step brought more of that thick, black ichor dripping from the corners of buildings, bleeding upward into the sky.

Then I saw her.

The girl from before the one I‚Äôd left behind when I escaped the Nowhere. She stood beneath a flickering streetlight that hummed like a dying heartbeat. Her hair shimmered pale against the dark, her face soft, ageless.

When she smiled, I felt the world tilt again.

‚ÄúWelcome back, Noone,‚Äù she whispered.

Her voice was the sound of the tide pulling away soft, endless, and merciless.

Part Four ‚Äì Hate

For a moment, I almost forgot the fear.
That old, hollow ache in my chest‚Äîthe one that once felt like home was replaced by something‚Ä¶ warmer.
I saw her again.
That same girl.
The one I thought I‚Äôd lost to the Nowhere.

She stood there, whole and bright beneath the city‚Äôs flickering streetlight, her pale hair trembling in the wind like it was made of seafoam.
And for just one heartbeat, I felt like a child again like some lost piece of me had finally come home.

But joy has a scent.
And this one smelled of rot and salt.

That stench hit before I even saw him.

The air thickened, sour and wet. My stomach twisted as that same gnarled hand the one I could never forget settled on her shoulder. The Ferryman. His presence bent the world around him, the light recoiling like it wanted nothing to do with him.

She didn‚Äôt scream.
She didn‚Äôt even look at me.
She just melted her body unraveling into ribbons of brine and shadow until she was gone again.

I stood there, trembling, my fists balled tight enough to draw blood.
It wasn‚Äôt just grief anymore. It was hate. Pure, molten hate.

It‚Äôs one thing to lose someone.
It‚Äôs another to have them given back, only to watch them be torn away in front of you.

All that strength I thought I‚Äôd built the kind that comes with growing older, surviving long enough to call yourself a man it shattered.
I wasn‚Äôt Jake the welder anymore. I wasn‚Äôt the survivor of the Nowhere.
I was that boy again. The one who screamed in locked rooms, praying for a hand that never came. I was Noone again‚Ä¶

I could feel the tears again hot, heavy, burning trails cutting through the grime on my cheeks.
They didn‚Äôt even feel like water.
They felt like blood.

My throat locked, but the words clawed their way out anyway.

‚ÄúWhat have you done?‚Äù
It wasn‚Äôt anger, not at first. Just grief. A sound too raw to be human.

The Ferryman didn‚Äôt answer. He stood there, dripping and silent, the void where his face should‚Äôve been somehow watching me.

‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO?!‚Äù
This time, it came out as fire rage bursting through the cracks of despair. I lunged at him, every nerve in me screaming for something to hit, something to break.
But no matter how far I reached, he was always just out of reach. The distance between us stretched, warped.

And then‚Ä¶ he shook his head.

Slowly.
Almost sorrowfully.

That faceless figure this thing that had taken everything from me looked like it understood.

The realization gutted me.
He didn‚Äôt hate me.
He pitied me.

‚ÄúAll you do is take,‚Äù I whispered. My voice broke into pieces, barely audible over the sound of the waves gnawing at the sand. I dropped to my knees. The ground beneath me shifted sand turning to wet metal, cold and slick. The air tasted of rust and iron, and somewhere above, I heard the rattling of chains through the clouds.

‚ÄúWhy‚Ä¶‚Äù I managed, choking on the word.
‚ÄúWhy do I have to lose everything?‚Äù

No answer.
Just the slow pull of the tide.

When he reached out again, I tried to back away. But his hand found my shoulder and the moment it did, I felt it.

My skin peeled like wet paper. My muscles tore free, layer by layer, the pain blooming red and blinding. My eyes sank backward, swallowed by the dark. The last thing I heard was the sound of water rushing through my skull like the sea filling a hollow shell.

Then

I woke.

My bunk.
The hum of generators.
The scent of oil and salt.

My face was wet tears still fresh, clinging to my skin. My chest rose and fell too fast, too heavy.

Josh was standing in the doorway, half-shadowed by the hall light. His expression was unreadable, a mix of concern and exhaustion.
‚ÄúFinally awake?‚Äù he asked, voice rough but low.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I couldn‚Äôt. I just swung my legs over the side and stood, weak and shivering. I must‚Äôve looked pathetic some grown man crying in his sleep after years of holding it together.

Josh didn‚Äôt say anything at first. He just sighed and nodded toward the corridor.
‚ÄúC‚Äômon,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúMess hall‚Äôs open. Coffee‚Äôll help.‚Äù

The air in the corridor was cold enough to sting. The faint metallic creaks of the rig echoed above us like the groaning of some great beast. Steam hissed from the pipes, and the lights flickered with each surge of power.

By the time we reached the mess hall, the cook was already at it‚Äîan older man with a salt-and-pepper beard and eyes that never looked surprised by anything. He handed me a cup of coffee with a quiet nod, no questions asked. The smell of it burnt and bitter almost made me feel alive again.

Josh sat across from me, elbows on the table, staring into his own cup. For a long time, neither of us said a word. The hum of the generators filled the silence like static.

Then he spoke.
Softly.
‚ÄúI think you saw him too.‚Äù

My head jerked up. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what did you just say?‚Äù

Josh‚Äôs eyes flicked to mine, steady and unflinching. He motioned for me to sit back down. ‚ÄúThe Ferryman,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou saw him.‚Äù

My throat went dry. I tried to lie‚Äîto pretend I didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about. But for once, I couldn‚Äôt.

So I told him everything.

About the institution.
About the thing that grew in my head.
About how it took my words, my body, and gave them back wrong.
About how the mirror had freed me, how the nightmares had stopped until the rig. Until the Eye.

Josh didn‚Äôt interrupt. He just listened, quiet and still.

When I finished, he looked down at the coffee between his hands, then reached into his jacket and pulled out something small metal, circular.

The company emblem.
The Eye of the Deep.

He turned it once between his fingers before setting it on the table.
The symbol gleamed faintly in the low light, and for a second, I swore it moved its center dilating like a real pupil.

Josh‚Äôs voice was almost a whisper.
‚ÄúHard to go nowhere,‚Äù he said.
Then, as the emblem seemed to open
‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs easy to go under.‚Äù

Part Five ‚Äì Acceptance

The Eye stared back at me.

Its center pulsed slow, deliberate as if it were breathing with me. And in that hollow rhythm, I finally understood what the company‚Äôs words meant when they said it reveals what hides.

My head throbbed. My pupils stretched wide, hungry for something they couldn‚Äôt name. I saw it all now. The reason the Candle did what he did. The reason the Ferryman kept coming back.

Trips aren‚Äôt free.

One descent into the mirror into your dreams and something follows you out. He wants you to stay. But if you take something back‚Ä¶ you owe a debt.

Someone else has to stay behind.

And I understood what I had to do.

Quietly, I slid one of the kitchen knives into my pocket. Josh didn‚Äôt notice. He was still staring into his coffee, lost in the endless hum of the rig. When I stood, he looked up.

‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have more to explain,‚Äù I told him, my voice calm, almost gentle. ‚ÄúBest to talk on the upper decks‚Ä¶ where no one‚Äôs listening.‚Äù

He hesitated, then nodded. Probably thought I was just paranoid again. Maybe he pitied me.

The staircase groaned beneath our boots, the metal slick with rain and oil. The sound of the machines filled the air a deep, pulsing hum that lived somewhere behind the ribs. It reminded me of the factory where I‚Äôd first found her. The girl made of light. The one I lost.

Every memory of her hurt now.
But that would be fixed soon.

When we reached the upper deck, the rain was falling harder. Josh tried to light a cigarette, shielding the match from the wind. His hands were shaking. I don‚Äôt think he noticed.

The flame flickered out before it ever caught.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting worse out here,‚Äù he said, his voice barely audible over the howl of the sea.

I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ it always does.‚Äù

He turned toward the railing, peering down at the waves. That‚Äôs when I stepped closer close enough to smell the salt on his jacket, the oil on his gloves. My hand found his back. I think he thought I was steadying him.

I wonder what he thought when I pushed.

His scream was lost to the wind. The rain swallowed it, like the sea was already waiting. There was a hollow clang, a crack bone against iron and then nothing.

Silence.
Then the bells.

Distant at first. Faint, like echoes from underwater.

The air smelled cleaner now. Not hostile almost peaceful.

But I knew it wasn‚Äôt enough.

I made my way back down the stairs. They felt longer than before more steps than there should‚Äôve been. Maybe he was trying to stop me. Maybe the Ferryman wanted me to think twice.

But I couldn‚Äôt.
I had a debt to pay.

When I reached the corridor, I brushed against one of the hot pipes and burned my hand. The pain was sharp, but far away like it belonged to someone else. I didn‚Äôt scream. Just kept moving.

The dorm door creaked open. Blake was stirring, half-awake, rubbing his eyes.

‚ÄúJake? What‚Äôre you-‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt let him finish.

The knife went in fast, deep, straight through his throat. The sound he made wasn‚Äôt human more like someone trying to breathe through mud. He gurgled, choked, blood spilling down his chest.

I didn‚Äôt look away.

Behind me, Gabe shouted, voice breaking. ‚ÄúJake‚Ä¶ what the hell, JAKE?! Oh God-‚Äù

He lunged forward, but I was already turning. The blade sank into his stomach, once, twice four, maybe five times. Each thrust felt heavier, slower, like my arm wasn‚Äôt mine anymore. Warm blood spread across my hand, sticky and pulsing.

Then‚Ä¶ silence.

They were both still.
The only sound left was the sea.

And then I saw him again.

The Ferryman stood in the doorway tall, dripping, faceless. The lights flickered behind him. Blake was still choking, still trying to breathe, and the Ferryman just watched.

The bells rang again louder now, rolling through the rig like thunder underwater.

Everything went black.

When I opened my eyes, I was lying on the surface of the sea. The water was calm, glassy. No horizon. Just endless reflection.

The sky and ocean folded into one another, a perfect mirror.

I couldn‚Äôt tell if I was floating‚Ä¶ or sinking.

But I felt him.
The Ferryman.
Always watching.

And for the first time, I didn‚Äôt feel afraid.

Only peace.
Only silence.
Only the sound of the bells, calling me home.

Part Six ‚Äì Revival

I woke.
Or at least, I thought I did.

The air burned cold in my lungs. Salt stung the back of my throat. My body felt heavy too heavy, like gravity had found a new way to punish me. The sea pressed close on every side, and when I opened my eyes, I realized I wasn‚Äôt in the water at all.

I was on it.

The ocean stretched out like glass, perfectly still, perfectly wrong. Every ripple moved slower than it should have as though time itself had drowned here. Above me, the sky was a bruise: dark, endless, and pulsing faintly with light.

Then I saw them.

Two silhouettes waiting on the horizon.
The Ferryman.
And her.

The moment I tried to stand, my knees buckled. Blood dark, almost black dripped from my hands into the water below. It didn‚Äôt spread. It just sank, disappearing into nothing.

She stepped forward first.
Her eyes found mine wide, fearful, and heartbreakingly familiar.

‚ÄúNoone‚Ä¶‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúOh, what have you done?‚Äù

Her voice trembled like glass about to shatter.
And for a moment, I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was grief or disgust that made it shake.

I looked down at myself. The stains hadn‚Äôt washed away. The red on my skin wasn‚Äôt rust it was memory. Blake. Gabe. Josh. Their names tasted like iron when I tried to speak.

‚ÄúI- I had to,‚Äù I said, the words catching in my throat. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt lose you again. Not after everything. Not after him.‚Äù

Her expression faltered, but only for a second. Then it hardened. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre no better than he is.‚Äù

The words landed like a blade.

I wanted to argue, to say I‚Äôd done it out of love, out of desperation. But all that came out was silence. I stood there, soaked in salt and guilt, while she turned away, staring into the horizon where the water met the sky.

The Ferryman didn‚Äôt move. He just watched. Always watching. His hat shadowed the place where his face should have been, and yet I could feel his eyes everywhere reflected in the waves, in the air, in her tears.

The rig rose out of the water behind us.
Only it wasn‚Äôt the rig anymore.

Its structure was wrong its ladders bending into staircases that led nowhere, its walls breathing with each slow pulse of the tide. The metal was alive. Every inch of it bore the company emblem The Eye stamped into steel, painted across bulkheads, carved into the skin of the dead.

And in every single one, an iris twitched. Watching. Waiting.

My chest tightened. ‚ÄúI never left,‚Äù I breathed. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt real. I never left the Nowhere.‚Äù

The Ferryman tilted his head slightly, as if to agree.

Human places create inhuman monsters.
That‚Äôs what Josh used to say.

I think I finally understood what he meant.

I turned to her again, desperate. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre real. You have to be.‚Äù

Her gaze softened sad, almost forgiving. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúI am. But I wish I wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù

That broke me.

I pulled her close, burying my face in her shoulder, terrified she‚Äôd dissolve into salt and foam like before. She trembled in my arms, cold and shaking, but she didn‚Äôt vanish. Not yet.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúJust stay. Even if it‚Äôs a lie.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer.

The air shifted. The sea began to move again slow, deliberate.
And then I was back on the ferry.

The Ferryman sat across from me, his coat dripping onto the boards. The bells tolled somewhere beneath the waves, their sound folding in on itself like an echo that refused to die.

He spoke at last.
His voice came from everywhere soft, endless, inescapable.

‚ÄúWas it worth it?‚Äù

I froze.
The question sank into me deeper than any blade.

‚ÄúWas‚Ä¶ what worth it?‚Äù I whispered, though I already knew.

He leaned forward. The shadow beneath his hat deepened.

‚ÄúWere three human lives fair for the value of one?‚Äù

His tone wasn‚Äôt cruel.
It was curious. Gentle.
And that made it worse.

I wanted to say yes.
I wanted to say no.
But all that came out was the truth.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, my voice cracking. ‚ÄúThey weren‚Äôt.‚Äù

The Ferryman nodded slowly. The sea around us darkened, the light fading from the sky.

‚ÄúDo you want to go back?‚Äù he asked.

His voice sounded different this time almost kind.

I thought about it. About the rig. About the bodies. About the silence that followed.
About the weight of every mistake that had dragged me here.

Finally, I shook my head. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

He tilted his head, studying me. ‚ÄúAnd yet you still fear what waits ahead.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been afraid my whole life,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ stopped pretending it mattered.‚Äù

The Ferryman seemed to consider that. Then he reached out one slow, heavy motion and placed his hand over mine.

The water began to rise.
Not to drown me, but to carry me.

My reflection blurred. My body dissolved at the edges. I felt the world unravel the sea, the sky, even her folding into one long breath.

When I opened my eyes again, I was small.
My hands were small. My voice was high, soft, human again.

The factory stood before me. The one where I first met her. The lights flickered. The air smelled of rust and rain.

And there she was waiting at the end of the hall, smiling that same impossible smile.

This time, I didn‚Äôt run.
This time, I walked toward her.

And when I reached out my hand, she took it.

The walls hummed. The lights dimmed. The world exhaled.

Then everything stopped.

I never woke up.

1obx2cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1obx2cu/my_personal_story_of_hanging_out_with_daniel/,My Personal Story of Hanging out with Daniel Naroditsky,"Hey guys, I'm so shocked and saddened right now.  I know how many of you loved Danya, and I wanted to share a quick story of the time I got to hang out with him because I don't know anyone else who would appreciate it, and I'd like to share the story with someone.  Maybe it'll be a bit cathartic to someone else who is grieving right now. 

Like many of you, I was introduced to Danya's YouTube channel during COVID shutdowns, and I was fortunate to catch his first speed run at about the time I started really playing chess.  I quickly became obsessed with the game, and found that my rating climbed as I watched his speed runs.  I live in Charlotte, and when I realized Danya lived here too and was a Golden State Warriors fan, I scored lower level tickets to the Hornets/Warriors game and invited him to join me as a thank you for all of the free lessons he'd given me over the years.

He accepted, and I met him outside of the stadium.  He was taller than I expected (I would guess 6'3""), and I was struck by how soft spoken he was compared to his confident persona on stream.  He was patient with me as I asked him questions about chess, how to get better, whose games he admired most among active and historical players, and why Magnus wasn't far-and-away the best Chess 960 player in the same way he's the best classical player.  

We talked about Danya's uncanny ability to recall previous positions he'd played throughout his life.  He even acknowledged that, before the speed run when his thinking was exposed to a broader audience, he hadn't realized that his ability to recall specific positions in specific games was a bit unique even among grandmasters. 

Danya was grateful for the opportunity to watch the Warriors play in such great seats and told me he'd love to give me a private lesson as a thank you.  I thanked him but said he'd given me hundreds of private lessons via his speed runs.  The truth was that I was embarrassed that I wasn't truly good enough to take lessons from him, which seems so silly in retrospect.  I told him how much I appreciated him and shared that it's exceedingly rare to find someone as talented as he is who is also able to articulate his thought process as well as he was. 

I invited him to join me at a college football bowl game later the same year, but he was traveling and wasn't able to join me.  He and I never interacted again after that, but I watched his speed runs religiously.

A few weeks ago, I thought about reaching out to him since he hadn't posted in a while just to check on him and to see if he wanted to grab a coffee or try to check out another game at some point.  I never reached out, and I really wish that I would have.  I'm not suggesting that would have changed anything, but I also can't think of a situation in life where I'd ever regret reaching out to someone who was important to me.  

Live is fragile folks.  I'm glad I had the opportunity to tell Danya how much he meant to me, and I'll be forever grateful for the hours of joy that he gave me in helping me learn a game I love so much. ",356,1761002287.0,chess,20,0.99,False

Everything was seeming wonderful, and on top of the world. We were going to get married. I bought a ring. I was set to propose. 

I suspect that she also has some avoidant attachment issues. 

But she said she just felt overwhelmed and needed to get out. She ‚Äúneeds to be single‚Äù for a while now, to figure herself out. 

After a text that I now regret sending, she and I met up for coffee last Friday and she basically just doubled down. She said she‚Äôs really happy being single right now. She recognizes I‚Äôm a good person, but she‚Äôs convinced we‚Äôre not the right people for each other. She said she feels like she made a mistake getting with me at all, because she was too fresh out of her previous relationship.

She says she really needs to be single right now to ‚Äúwork on herself‚Äù. There‚Äôs a level of immaturity there, that really worries me. She‚Äôs wanting to work on her art, her new social media page, she just got a new car and she‚Äôs wanting to like deck out the inside of it. She‚Äôs also just always used this lowkey self-deprecating language about herself (glorifying being a ‚Äútrashy girl‚Äù, worrying that everyone‚Äôs going to hate her, etc. ). She has a long long long history of trauma that I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ever really addressed. 

She needs to focus on getting better, not her art projects. She needs to be in therapy, she needs to be consistent with her meds, she needs to mitigate her triggers. I love her. I have so much love for her. I want her well. She has no one in her life that‚Äôs like, holding her accountable. She has plenty of friends but none of them are, like, checking in on her and rooting for her to get well. She lives at home but her mom isn‚Äôt really, like, involved with her treatments. I feel like I was the first one in a long time to really like, show active care for her treatment. 

I just can‚Äôt stop worrying about her. I can‚Äôt stop catastrophizing what her journey looks like: bad decisions, getting in trouble, falling down a spiral. I need to know she‚Äôs going to be okay. My anxiety about her wellbeing is making me wish I could just insert myself into her life and make sure she does everything she needs to, to be well. ",1,1761002096.0,BipolarSOrecovery,0,1.0,False

Ran into a female coworker/friend Sunday morning and she kinda ran right past me without stopping to talk. She had a coffee in her hand and I just said ‚Äúsee ya around‚Äù and she said ‚Äúhave a nice weekend‚Äù She seemed somewhat worried to see me as well. 

Was she just in a rush to get somewhere/use the bathroom? Or did she not want to talk to me. I can‚Äôt think of what I could have done because on Friday she honked her horn at me while she saw me leaving work. 

Today the same thing happened, I saw her in the hallway and didn‚Äôt acknowledge she got super close and then immediately ducked into the bathroom and gave me a quick head nod. Was she going into the bathroom to get away from me????

1obwyog,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1obwyog/34_m4f_kansasmissouri_seeking_good_company_and/,34 [M4F] - #Kansas/Missouri - Seeking good company and great conversation.,"After several conversations on here, I feel the need to say that the emphasis on ""great conversation"" in the title is very genuine. As in, if you are the type of person who enjoys getting to know others, we are likely to get along quite well! I find a lot of my attraction develops from real conversation where two people learn and discover from one another, so if you aren't available and/or interested in the time it takes to develop that connection, I'm probably not the person for you.

That all said, I'm sure this is more a reflection of the senility reflecting my advancing age talking, and maybe this is  my life's version of my very own walking uphill both ways to school, but didn't flirting/dating/seducing used to be different? There was a time in my life where people used to actually take the time to get to know each other. There was an attraction and dopamine hit that grew a little bit each day as you learned the intricacies and oddities of each other. Before long you would find yourself eagerly awaiting their next message and smiling like a dingus when it came.


Now, you put up a few pictures and tell everyone about how much you love to travel despite that permanent impression in your couch looking suspiciously familiar, your shopping list of the perfectly curated partner you've created in your mind, and you hope someone bites. But maybe, just maybe, we‚Äôre missing the good stuff: the slow burn, the dumb smiles, the thrill of finding someone who gets your oddities. Can we ditch the swipe era of dating and bring back the art of the real, unfiltered connection?
 
 
I'm here looking for what dating, romance, the whole shebang used to be. At least, what I perceive that it used to be. I don't really care what you look like, other than that I do tend to prefer people in average (or better) shape, just because I'm not that large of a guy myself. You don't  need to pretend to be well-traveled or a seasoned mountain climber. What I'd really enjoy is getting to know someone, learning about your interests and intricacies and intent, and seeing where things might lead between us. If you're someone who considers yourself any sort of combination of interesting, quirky, sassy, kind, intelligent, ambitious, or spontaneous, then I would definitely love to talk to you. Let‚Äôs skip the polished profiles and get to the good part - two people, no pretenses, just connecting and seeing if we're two oddballs that happen to work for one another.  
 
 
A little about me:  
 
\- In the spirit of being upfront, I am married with kids. For reasons that I'm happy to tell you about in private if you are interested to know, we are very much in romantic-less relationship and keep it together for our kids while they are young. I am completely understanding of someone not wanting to be involved with that type of situation, but it seemed best to be upfront about it now rather than tell you about it later.

\- I consider myself to be a very light-hearted, relaxed, and perhaps slightly sarcastic (in what I hope is an endearing way) sort of a person. I love good conversations and getting to know people with on conversations that dig deeper than perseverating over whether or not it's hotter today than yesterday. I want to know what makes you tick‚Äîyour weird passions, your secret dreams, and why you people keep insisting on putting ketchup on things it doesn't belong on.  
 
 
\- Great education and a career that I'm jazzed about, and happy to tell you all about it over coffee or other equally enticing beverages, though I'm firmly on the 'work to live' end of the spectrum and enjoy my free time.  
 
\- My hobbies are all over the place, but on a day off, you can usually find me loss in a great book, playing handyman around my house,  trying out a new recipe in the kitchen, or having some drinks over board games with a few friends.  
 
 
\- White, probably pretty average looking in a way that I'm perfectly content with, and don't have any particular preferences regarding your appearance or race.  
 
 
So, if you're near-ish my age, near-ish my location, and interested in getting to know someone with the end goal of actually meeting in person at some point, I would absolutely love to hear from you. I'm in the northern part of KS, but open to light travel if there's a connection. Drop me a line and let‚Äôs see if we can't take a step back from the Tinder era of dating?",1,1761002027.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1obwxws,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1obwxws/chokeddragged_down_my_stairs_by_neighbor/,Choked/dragged down my stairs by neighbor,"Location: New Jersey 
My neighbors opened the  gate to my property without permission and allowed an exterminator to spray chemicals along the side of *their* house. I opened my window, confronted the exterminator, and told him he needed to ask before entering my property. I then closed the window. About five minutes later, my visibly angry neighbor ran up my stairs and started complaining. I called her a miserable bitch because she constantly harassesinf my little sisters and is getting angry I spoke to the exterminator. She then called the police, who investigated and confirmed that my neighbor must ask permission before entering or using my property.

For the next three weeks, nothing happened. Then, last night, my brother‚Äîwho was not involved in the earlier incident‚Äîwas attacked by my neighbor's husband. At around 5:30 a.m., as my brother was walking home, the husband confronted him and repeatedly challenged him to fight. My brother said it was too early for this and walked up our staircase. The neighbor then threw his metal flask, filled with hot coffee, at my brother. He sprinted up the stairs, punched my brother repeatedly in the head, choked him, and dragged him to the bottom of the staircase. He didn't stop until my brother said it wasn't him. The husband then told my brother that he owned two guns and threatened to shoot him in the fucking head next time. 

I have the entire incident on camera. The police came, reviewed the footage, said they were issuing a warrant, and left. An hour later, they called me and said they were not proceeding with the warrant and that I would have to go to court instead because I didn‚Äôt sustain enough injuries. This seems ridiculous and I‚Äôm not happy with this convulsion and not sure how to proceed.",9,1761001970.0,legaladvice,0,0.8,False

basically I was using those Crest strips because everyone says they're the best right?

I'm talking sharp pain every time I breathed in cold air. I was so done with the whole thing.

anyway I was bitching about it to my coworker and she was like ""oh you should try Gnaw Labs, I've never had issues with those"" and I'm sitting there like yeah sure another brand is gonna be totally different.

but I had a wedding coming up and I was desperate so whatever, bought a box fully expecting the same hell

dude. I don't know what's in these but I've been using them for 7 days and literally ZERO pain?? I can drink my iced coffee like a normal person?? my gums aren't angry at me??

idk what the difference is in the formula but I'm not questioning it at this point. just relieved I didn't have to show up to this wedding looking like I haven't seen a dentist in years lmao

anyone else have horror stories with Crest strips or am I just weird?",0,1761001969.0,HygieneTips,2,0.5,False
1obwxbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1obwxbp/should_i_step_away/,Should I step away?,"I‚Äôm the female part of an ENM relationship. Early this summer I met a girl and it was wonderful. The NRE was off the charts, we met regularly and texted daily. 

Neither of us were seeing anyone else at the time.  She talked of a partner she had a couple of years prior that she hoped to see again eventually. In describing him she said he was dominant, handsome and easy going. I always joked that I needed one of those too. 

The last couple of months I‚Äôve felt her pull away. She did have some health issues and a change of job. I was very supportive and reassuring, offering to go sit with her and share a coffee or just hang out, no sex required. I liked her way more than that. I felt like I was just waiting and in a way missing out on meeting other people to respect our ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù. 

Fast forward to the present. We had dinner 2 weeks ago, spoke of setting a time to be intimate since we both still want it. In reality, she‚Äôs giving me breadcrumbs. I felt the lack of interest by her for months now even if she justifies it with her health. 

Last week I met a couple on Feeld. We had drinks. Set a playdate for tomorrow evening. Guess what I figured out today? It‚Äôs him. The guy she had seen. I verified with him and he confirmed and didn‚Äôt see an issue with still seeing me. 

I reached out to her to tell her. Her reaction wasn‚Äôt great. In the end she said she‚Äôd step back if I want to pursue it but gave me some grief about it. Keep in mind she hasn‚Äôt had sex with him in 3 years, seen him in 2. They did have plans to grab a drink this summer but like a lot of the plans she made with me, it was canceled. 

My dilemma is : do I still go see this couple? We really vibed when meeting and the 3 of us are super excited about meeting. I know that I cannot continue seeing a woman who will want to control who I see. I do not understand why she thinks me seeing them stops her from seeing him eventually.

1obww0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Procrastinationism/comments/1obww0u/i_was_the_background_character_in_my_own_life_for/,I was the background character in my own life for 4 years,"For a long time my days looked identical. Wake up, scroll for an hour, go to work, come home, order food, binge whatever show everyone was talking about, sleep. Weekends I'd hang out with people, but I was always just there. The listener. The person who laughed at everyone's jokes and asked follow-up questions. Never the one with stories to tell.

I thought I was being a good friend. Really I was just hiding behind other people's lives because I didn't have one of my own.

The moment that broke me was random. I was at a dinner party and someone asked what I'd been up to. I opened my mouth and realized I had nothing to say. ""Just work, you know. Same old stuff."" Meanwhile everyone else was talking about trips they'd taken, projects they'd started, things they were learning. I felt invisible.

That night I decided something had to change. I couldn't keep living like an extra in someone else's movie.

I started small. The next morning I didn't touch my phone for the first hour. Instead I made coffee slowly and sat on my balcony. It felt uncomfortable. My brain kept screaming for stimulation. But I sat there anyway.

That weekend I didn't wait for an invitation. I went to a museum alone. Walked through the exhibits at my own pace. Bought a postcard of a painting I liked. It was weird being there by myself but also kind of freeing. Nobody to perform for. Just me and whatever caught my attention.

A week later I signed up for a cooking class. I'm terrible at cooking but that wasn't the point. The point was doing something instead of watching other people do things.

It's been eight months now. I started running in the mornings, joined a book club, learned basic photography, and started volunteering at an animal shelter on Sundays. Some of it stuck, some didn't. But that doesn't matter. What matters is I'm finally living instead of spectating.

Now when someone asks what I've been up to, I actually have answers. I have photos to show. Stories that are mine. Opinions about things I've experienced instead of just consumed through a screen.

I still support my friends and listen to their lives. But I'm not hiding anymore. I'm not filling the empty space in conversations with questions because I have nothing to contribute. I exist now in a way I didn't before.

It's wild how you can wake up one day and realize you've been sleepwalking through your own existence. Just watching everyone else live while you sit on the sidelines waiting for something to happen.

Nothing's going to happen unless you make it happen. And it doesn't have to be huge. It just has to be yours and most people lack this. I know you're not one of them.",32,1761001830.0,Procrastinationism,2,1.0,False

* Having breakfast recipes, like bacon and eggs, toast, cereal, coffee, sandwiches etc (we can make a bread basket).

* We also need more fruits plants like strawberries, lemon, orange, or watermelon. With more fruits we can make drinks and more recipes for dessert. (we have so much milk now, imagine placing a glass of milk next to some cookies).

Also imagine if one day we do get the apothecary skill we can make posin, and some potion can be put into food. A example of this is when cooking with we use a potion that can give us more stamina, which will make climbing so much easier. (I know we could just drink the potion).

Palia's is still in beta, not fully polished yet, which is why I hope more things comes to the cooking skil, and to all the other skills as well.

My fabricator told me today that it is fine for me to use my sealer instead of them sealing it at their shop. However, they can‚Äôt guarantee that the silicone or seam glue won‚Äôt leave shadowing.

at first, she talked to me a lot, but she started texting me SO much, video calling me SO MUCH like OBSESSIVELY and that made me extremely anxious.

i‚Äôm kind of recovering from social anxiety so at that time i was more a people pleaser than now (thought i still have my tendencies).

anyway, in general i think we‚Äôre not compatible as friends, i don‚Äôt really feel like myself or comfortable with her, not necessarily because something she‚Äôs done, i just don‚Äôt think our personalities match, she makes me feel overwhelmed. i feel like she just puts this pressure on me, for example when i told her i want to switch jobs cuz im in this bad place, she got obsessive over me coming to her workplace even thought i did not wanna be there at all, and i wanted to go to this other place and she knew that. and every time i mentioned wanting to go to the place i wanted instead of her workplace, she started pressuring me like i had to give an excuse for not wanting ?? or when she wanted to meet up for coffee after work (my house is 3 hours away from my job) and i didn‚Äôt want to cuz i was in a bad place and just wanted to go home, i told her that and she wouldn‚Äôt take no as an answer and then kinda made me feel guilty about saying no. so in general she‚Äôs like the least compatible person ever for my people pleasing tendencies to handle üò≠

at first i  called her for a while and stuff and then i started being a little dry and not answer any of her calls because they made me super anxious. she sent SO much.

the issue here is that she thinks of me as a close friend when i don‚Äôt feel the same at all. she clearly feels comfortable with me but i don‚Äôt with her. friendships take time to build and she just acted like it from the beginning, and i don‚Äôt even wanna be her close friend. 

anyway, after like months of not texting, she sends me this:

‚Äúhey, obviously we got distant, maybe it‚Äôs because i started talking only about one thing (her crush, for context), but idk.
you‚Äôre really important to me and i miss you. 
if you have time to meet up or even talk over face time i would be happy‚Äù

immediately my mind was filled with anxiety üò≠ it‚Äôs not like she was mean to me and i really don‚Äôt want to hurt her because she doesn‚Äôt deserve it, but i also have to put myself first because i never do and it‚Äôs just causing me to be anxious. the thing is, i don‚Äôt mind seeing her like once a while idk like every half year or so and being friendly with her but i genuinely don‚Äôt want to be her friend. i would be lying to myself and her too if i just pretended to do so.

i replied and told her it‚Äôs not because something she said or did but my life is just really busy rn 
and we could meet and catch up sometime 

then she asked me when and i told her that im actually not available in the next two weeks (the truth btw)

but now that time is coming up and my mind is just racing with anxiety idk what to do.

all my friends just tell me to ghost / block her but i think that‚Äôs just plain mean and she doesn‚Äôt deserve that i know that could really hurt a person, especially since she clearly thinks of me as someone important to her.

but i don‚Äôt want to give her false hope, and i do want to prioritize myself as well.

1obwo5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/1obwo5s/70s80s_book_of_monsters/,70s/80s book of monsters,"I had a book as a child that was a kind of bestiary of strange monsters. I believe it was formatted so that there would be the description of the monster on one page and a painting on the opposite page. The ONLY monster that I recall was something like 'The Man-Eating Wall', or something similiar. The painting depicted a large exterior stone wall with a human-ish mouth with fangs, and I think there was blood dripping from it. 

  
\- It was like a small coffee table book size - maybe 8x11"", I believe, and soft cover.

\- It was NOT a kids book.

  
\- The paintings were fairly realistic - not cartoonish at all.

  
It terrified me, and now I must find it!!",3,1761001264.0,whatsthatbook,0,1.0,False
