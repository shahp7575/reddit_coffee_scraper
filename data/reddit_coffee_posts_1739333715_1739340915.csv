Today, I told her I was planning to send her flowers for Valentine‚Äôs Day at work. She responded by saying no, that it would be weird because ‚Äúnobody gets flowers at work for Valentine‚Äôs Day.‚Äù She also asked if I was doing it to ‚Äúmark my territory‚Äù and said she didn‚Äôt want that.

I found this really odd because when I sent her flowers for her birthday, she didn‚Äôt say she didn‚Äôt want them or that having them at work was an issue. Is this a red flag?",1,1739340778.0,LongDistance,0,1.0,False

1inkflu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1inkflu/im_sorry_for_acting_crazy/,I'm sorry for acting crazy,"I messaged you for 4 months, repeatedly. Pleading, begging, and hoping you'd come back in my life.  I tried to let you go repeatedly but I couldn't.  I tried to not think of you, of us but I couldn't. The very thought of us not being together terrified me, scared me. You blocked me and yet I found ways to contact you. I couldn't stop. I don't know why I couldn't stop. You told me to leave you alone, you told me you want me out of your life, but I couldn't stop trying to convince you to give us another chance. 

If I could have just, just given you space and been in less panic than before. If I could have just, controlled myself a bit more, then maybe you'd have come back. I absolutely ruined any chance we had of being together again. My anxiety ruined everything. 

I was being selfish in those messages, I didn't think of how they would have affected you. I was so blind. I just wanted us back, I believed you'd love me and just wanted us back. I hope you still think of me. I hope you don't hate me. 

But now I realise that I was being selfish. I should have thought of your mental well-being, your new job and how all these constant messages must be affecting you. I'm sorry, I was just blinded by that fear of losing you, it's not an excuse I just truly regret it. I should have respected your boundaries. 

But now, now it's never too late. I'll leave you alone, I'll leave you be. I'll respect you now because I care about you. 

It's probably too late for us, and honestly, you deserve better than someone who was immature and couldn't respect your boundaries. 

But still...I'll wait. Patiently, from afar, I'll wait and hope. Hope that somewhere deep down you still care about me enough to at least reach out and talk to me. Maybe...one day we can be friends and laugh about this in a coffee shop somewhere and joke about how dramatic I was. 

If you're reading this, I truly am sorry to have not respected your boundaries. I wish you the best ahead in life.

**Blurb:**

**What does it take to turn your life around? Death, of course!**¬†

I died in this lame ass world of ours and woke up in a completely new one. I had a new name, a new face and a new body. This was my second chance to live a better life than the previous one.¬†

But goddamn it, why did I have to be a witch? Now I don't just have to be on the run from the Inquisition that wants to burn me and my friends. But I also have to earn a living?¬†

1. Makes new friends and tries to save them and herself from getting burned
2. Finds redemption from the deeds of her previous life
3. Tries to get along with a cat who (like most cats) believes she runs the world
4. Deals with other slice of life shenanigans

**\_\_**

  
**Chapter 19. Lies**

  
**Three days later**.

I opened my eyes and looked at the sun shining in the window. I sat up and stretched my back. We were still in Asmod's little apartment. But something was different today.

We were free.

Two days ago, we accomplished what we'd set out to do. Asmod had used his enchantment magic to write and sign a letter that resembled Smokewell's handwriting to anyone who saw it. We had Hopper forge a fake report to prove us innocent. We even did that stupid knife test.

All the evidence was sent to the court. The verdict was passed a lot more swiftly than we expected. We were taken off the priority burn list. And now we didn't have to worry about getting arrested and burnt anymore.

I brushed my teeth, got dressed and walked out to the sitting room. Lily and Smokewell were on the sofa, going through the newspapers, probably looking for any apartment advertisements.

Asmod was watering a plant with lavender flowers in the window. He had taken a day off. I didn't blame him. The entire week had been quite a rush for all of us.

I sat down in a chair opposite to them.

‚ÄúGood morning, Miss Elsa!‚Äù Lily said, cheery as always.

‚ÄúMorning, Lily.‚Äù

Smokewell and Asmod just nodded at me. I nodded back.

I knit my eyebrows before saying, ‚ÄúDo you all think we won?‚Äù

‚ÄúWon what? The lottery?‚Äù Smokewell said.

‚ÄúNo, I meant‚Ä¶our freedom. We are supposed to be free. Not fugitives anymore, yet I feel a bit‚Ä¶empty.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you feel that way, Miss Elsa?‚Äù Lily cocked her head.

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI don't know, maybe it's just that we got away by basically lying to everyone,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEveryone in this room knows that the knife test was nothing but superstitious non-sense. But we exploited that very non-sense to make our case.‚Äù

‚ÄúTch, what's so bad about that?‚Äù Smokewell said. ‚ÄúThe world is a non-sensical place. The laws are foolish and people are idiots. They arrest us and execute us for their stupid reasons and you think we are the bad people for using their stupidity to save our hides?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm not saying we are bad people,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt's just that‚Ä¶we exploited the rules of a system that we don't believe in and we know that the system is flawed yet we used those flaws to escape. Instead of‚Ä¶bringing a change.‚Äù

Asmod stepped away from the window. ‚ÄúIt isn't our responsibility to change the system, Grimly. In fact, the ones who are responsible don't even care.‚Äù

I sighed and ran my fingers through my hair. I didn't really know why I was getting worked up over it. I actually agreed with what they were saying. But there was a gnawing feeling at the back of my mind. I wasn't sure if it was something I'd inherited along with Old Elsa's body. Or if I just found it nauseous to rely on something toxic in order to keep living.

‚ÄúI'm sorry, I'm just rambling. Ignore me,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lily said. ‚ÄúI agree with Miss Elsa.‚Äù

All eyes turned to the girl.

She looked down at the newspaper in front of her. ‚ÄúI thought about this too,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat if someone innocent failed the knife test? What if someone whose blood was green for a completely different reason ended up arrested? I know, it isn't our responsibility to worry about this. But, this does feel unfair.‚Äù

Smokewell groaned. ‚ÄúDon't tell me you are going to do something to change this now?‚Äù

Lily looked at me, as if she was going to agree with whatever I said. I sighed again and rose from the seat. ‚ÄúNo, I won't,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf I was alone, it was a different matter. But we are together here. And we had to take more than a few risks to earn our freedom. I won't ruin it just like that.‚Äù

I walked over to the door.

‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù Smokewell said.

‚ÄúI'm going to take a walk. I want a break from all this.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm coming along, Miss Elsa!‚Äù Lily hopped off the seat.

I gave a wry smile and let her follow. We left the apartment.

Lily was quiet most of the way. I appreciated the silence. She seemed a lot more excited to take in the view of the city. I didn't blame her. Quite the view it was, indeed.

I got to see the things that I couldn't make out that night on our drive to Skeleton Crew. There was a nice tapestry of businesses that flanked the streets. Taverns and shops that looked old were paneled with wood and had a rustic look to them. Bigger establishments were made of concrete and steel.

Some vendors were hailing their wares. One of them was a woman selling potions. Nothing too kinky, something that enhanced alertness and physical energy more than a strong cup of coffee would‚Äìprobably the Red Bull equivalent of this world.

A few paces ahead another man was doing the same thing. But he was hailing steam powered stoves, blessed by the steam elemental itself. I found his marketing strategy quite interesting. He seemed more focused on letting people know that his product was going to be a household item in a few months and everyone who won‚Äôt buy it will regret it when their neighbors and friends will flaunt it in front of them.

I wondered if actually showing the features of his stove would've been a better way of enticing people's money out of their wallets but I was wrong. A sizable crowd had gathered outside his little shop.

‚ÄúIt's the steam elemental,‚Äù Lily said. ‚ÄúPeople will hop onto any wagon that associates itself with those two words.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù

We left behind what was the Bronzewheel Boulevard and arrived at Eternity Square. The clock tower next to Asmod's Nook was visible even from all the way here, rising above all the other buildings.

But a much more interesting structure was right at the centre of the square. A tall pyramid with the tip shorn off out of which steam kept rising into the air. The pyramid was made of bronze and shiny golden letters adorned the front of its face that read: **HOLY HOUSE OF THE STEAM ELEMENTAL.**

‚ÄúHave you ever been inside one?‚Äù I asked Lily.

The girl shook her head but gave me a weird look. ‚ÄúDon't tell me you want to attend whatever they are having there, Miss Elsa?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm certainly curious,‚Äù I said as the steam carriages ran in and out of the square. ‚ÄúAren't you interested in seeing what all the fuss is about?‚Äù

Lily gave a reluctant nod but her eyes were inquisitive. We walked into the pyramid through the door at the front.

I was surprised that the inside of it didn't feel like being in an oven. Even though the outside of the pyramid was made of metal. Another thing that surprised me was how sturdy the structure was from the inside.

A large circular pit was at the centre of the floor. Smoke kept rising out of the pit and up into the chimney above. The strange thing about the smoke was that it only moved in a straight column, as if being blown through an invisible glass tube that opened into the chimney above.

There were levels on each tier of the pyramid and every tier was filled with people chanting and praying. The lower level was a lot more dense with life than the ones above them. Lily and I climbed the stairs to the first level. People stood by the bannister rail at the edge. I took my place among the crowd and looked down at the hole in the floor.

‚ÄúI didn't know you were into this, Miss Elsa,‚Äù Lily said.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúInto gods and faith.‚Äù She put her elbows on the rail and leaned ahead. ‚ÄúI feel like you might be into several other things I didn't think you were into.‚Äù

I remained quiet for a bit and focused on Old Elsa's memories, trying to remember her thoughts on Gods. What I learnt was that most covens of witches prayed to a certain dark entity that lent its powers to them. Lily and Smokewell and I didn't belong to any such coven, so our relationship with any kind of God, aside from a few offerings made in some specific rituals, had been minimal.

And since Old Elsa had been rather aloof and reserved, seeing me getting curious about these things was probably coming as a surprise to Lily. ‚ÄúI told you, I was just curious,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúBut this isn't really how you usually seek answers, you know?‚Äù Lily said, gazing into the pit of steam. ‚ÄúYou mostly look for answers in the books and documents.‚Äù

I looked at the rising steam as well. ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said, even though I didn't. ‚ÄúBut sometimes, books can't give you all the answers. Sometimes, you end up with more questions after reading a book.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Lily said, sounding surprised. ‚ÄúI never would've expected you to say that.‚Äù

I smiled wistfully. Old Elsa must've been a total nerd. I leaned ahead on the bannister too. ‚ÄúI wouldn't have either but‚Ä¶I've felt a change in myself. I don't remember ever seeing the kind of things I've seen in the past few days. And I want to see more. Learn more. Learn more than what a book will tell me.‚Äù

Lily smiled at me. ‚ÄúI like this change in you, Miss Elsa,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI like that you are telling me what you have on your mind. I hope this change doesn't go away.‚Äù

I turned back to the steaming pit when another voice spoke up, ‚ÄúThis was the last place I expected to find you.‚Äù

It was General Hopper. Lily and I took our hands off the bannister and regarded the man warily.

‚ÄúDon't worry,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI'm not looking to cause any trouble.‚Äù

I frowned but I did notice that he was wearing a simple shirt with suspenders, trousers and a long coat. This wasn't his uniform.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady and my face unreadable.

‚ÄúI wanted to talk to you about something,‚Äù Hopper said as he gazed into the pit below.

‚ÄúWell, then spill it,‚Äù Lily said, her jaw was tight.

Hopper said nothing, he simply glimpsed at his pocket watch and looked down into the steaming pit.

Through the darkness and the smoke, a man appeared, standing atop an iron platform that seemed to float on the rising steam. He was dressed in a leather jacket of black and grey and the bottoms of the trousers were covered with red patterns that looked like flames. He wore a large glass sphere on his head and blue steam whirled inside the glass. His hands were raised and he was facing the sky.

Chants and prayer turned louder and more frantic as he rose above the consecutive tiers of the pyramid. People were calling him the Priest of Steam but he looked more like a biker from an 80s sci-fi comic to me.

As the volume of the voices went higher inside the pyramid, Hopper leaned close to me and spoke into my ear, ‚ÄúI know the knife test wasn't real. And you hadn't really cursed me.‚Äù

1ink7j3,https://i.redd.it/ycfmpcvwdnie1.jpeg,Help me make this room as quiet as possible ü§´,"Hi guys! I‚Äôm a therapist and podcaster and I‚Äôm moving into this new office space. In my previous space, there was also a barn door, but it was made of plywood instead of glass. I saw success using adhesive acoustic panels from Amazon on the exterior to help block noise from the hall. I‚Äôm wondering what my best options are for this door- here are the things I‚Äôm noticing need to be addressed:

1.	‚Å†The floor- I‚Äôm planning on getting a 3/8‚Äù felt rug pad that‚Äôs 7‚Äô10 x 9‚Äô10 with an 8x10 rug over it. The room is 10x10 so that will take up the entirety of the floor.

Rug pad: (https://a.co/d/9amhxwc)

2. Per privacy laws, I have to block sight into the office. The exterior windows already have privacy film, and I‚Äôll be putting up curtains to close at night when you can see in. The interior windows, I just did a vinyl privacy film myself and that worked great. So that‚Äôs my plan for all of those- am open to suggestions

Curtains: (https://a.co/d/eBFRINE)

Privacy film for internal window on left: (https://a.co/d/7KFhMSq)

3. The glass barn door is my biggest foe. Not only do I need to protect privacy, it‚Äôs also the biggest problem area for sound. As you can see there‚Äôs a pretty extensive gap between the door and the wall, as well as it being made of glass üòÇüòÇ

I‚Äôm thinking I can use weatherstripping around the door to close the gap, and a draft blocker along the bottom on both sides of the glass

Weatherstripping: (https://a.co/d/86N9va2) 

Draft blocker: (https://a.co/d/at1JJOE)

So the glass door itself is the next thing to tackle. Because I need to block vision, and I‚Äôd like to have it as quiet as possible in the inside, I‚Äôm thinking about panels again. The only problem is, now that it‚Äôs glass instead of plywood, my clients would see the ugly painters tape I put all over the door before putting on the panels (to protect the glass), which would mean I‚Äôd need to do something on the interior side too. Either more panels, or more privacy film?

Before you suggest sound dampening curtains, I really only want that as a last resort. I think it looks more professional to have the door soundproofed as opposed to slapping up some curtains that I‚Äôd have to open to open the door. Much easier, I know. But ugly and probably not as effective as panels anyways.

So- what do ya have for me?! It‚Äôs 7‚Äôx3.5‚Äô

What is the best thing to do with this door and do you have suggestions for things I‚Äôve missed?

PS. I live in a rural area that has almost no where to lease a single office space post-covid. So picking an office with thick, sturdy, soundblocking doors was not an option (as evidenced by my having to do this at the last place too!). I‚Äôm working with what I‚Äôve got, here!

PPS. This side of the building is leased only to ‚Äúquiet‚Äù tenants, whereas my last space was chaos. So this place will already be really, really quiet. This space at least only shares one neighboring wall, and the exit out to the lobby. My last space I had 3 neighbors on my exterior walls AND the exit to a busy hallway.

PPPS. I use an Alexa inside the suite playing brown noise to drown out lower frequencies like talking in other rooms. Also, the furniture in the room besides the rug will be: a large leather couch, a coffee table, a wingback chair for me, a rolling side table for my laptop and water, two small end tables with lamps in either side of the couch, a mini fridge, a mounted whiteboard on one of those corner walls, acrylic bookshelves with cover-facing-out books filling the other corner wall, a couple mounted clocks, a big ol‚Äô painting over the couch, and my frame degree and license. Quite a bit of sound dampening furniture as well- basically as much as I can put in there without it looking cluttered!

I‚Äôve been intimidated by a lot of what I‚Äôve read on Reddit where people misuse the word soundproof, etc and get their heads ripped off so please be nice! I‚Äôm just a gal out here trying to make my little space as peaceful and quiet for my podcast recording and the clients on my couch as possible üíõüíõüíõ tyia

1ink5tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ink5tj/what_we_learned_launching_a_dating_app_without/,What We Learned Launching a Dating App Without Data Tracking,"Hello fellow entrepreneurs,

Like many of you, I have always tried to solve puzzles. One such puzzle that has intrigued me for quite a long period of time is privacy about online dating or rather the lack of it. A large number of dating apps track everything: location, conversations, with whom you have swiped up, and went on to even sell that information.

That, of course, led to an idea: what if an actual dating app respected privacy?

Fast forward months of late nights, endless coffee, and plenty of trial and error, and we launched FlirtOS a privacy-first dating platform that encrypts chats, doesn't track users, and gives full control over data.

Great in theory, but here's what I didn't expect:

People SAY they care about privacy‚Ä¶ but do they really?
We had thought that this would be the greatest selling factor, but it appears most users still favor AI-powered matching despite tracking.

Markets for a privacy-first product are way harder than imagined.

Privacy does not sound ""exciting"" like AI. How to get users to care if they don't even realize they are being tracked?

Balancing privacy and user experience is a challenge.
Features like ""who viewed your profile"" require tracking. How do you make a dating app engaging without data collection?

We've been figuring it out as we go, and I'd love to hear from other business owners who have built privacy-focused products or disrupted competitive markets.

How do you communicate privacy as a value, not just a feature?
Have you had success getting users to switch from big-name competitors?
What's the best way to build trust as a new platform in a crowded space?

Sister haven't been talking with our mother for like a year, before that there were a short period when she talked and before that was another year of silence. 

My mother has alcohol issues and I do understand why there were ones, but I don't understand why now. She has a good house, a boyfriend of 10 years who is a best man I have ever known (i don't know how he puts up with her sometimes, but he is at really demanding work trips most time of the year), she doesn't have to work, she can pursue hobbies and do sports, but no, every one or two months she has to find some excuse to drink for a week and then to be hungover for like 4 days. 

When not drunk she asks about how is my sister doing, and sometimes my sister asks about her. But most of the time they vent to me how the annoy each other, my sister and grandmother tells me to talk some sense into her ""Because you are the only one she listens to"", and mom vents to me about stress and how my sister doesn't clean (when mother gets drunk I maintain a household, it was like this since I was 10 or so). Sister and grandmother tells me to tell her that ""alcohol is bad for her health"". No shit Sherlock. 

She doesn't care. If she would, she would stop after two seizures and find another way to deal with her nerves. She tells me ""I am a grown woman"", and I am no just like, fine, okay, you are so grown up, deal with consequences, I am not your mother to teach you what is good and what is wrong. 

I'm sick of everyone expect me to fix her views. I shut down every time someone starts to talk to me about her problems. I want to tell them the truth. That I don't care about her health if she doesn't care herself. 

When not drunk she's a nice mother, was a bit strict early on and used a belt sometimes, but became more chill and taught me a lot of stuff. I forgive her every time, my sister did not, I get that but I am tired of being a negotiator.

she asked me if i found something else to love, something that made me feel as alive as gymnastics once did. i struggled to find a way to respond, still searching for that answer myself.

i told her about the courage we found, the kind that doesn‚Äôt come from sticking a landing but from facing each day after having our dreams taken away. i told her about the strength we built, not in muscle but in spirit. how we were learning to bend without breaking even if it wasn‚Äôt the flexibility we once mastered.

1injzsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/traveltipsworldwide/comments/1injzsq/my_experience_and_tips_after_a_1_week_trip_in/,My experience and tips after a 1 week trip in Costa Rica,"My girlfriend and I spent roughly 7 days in Costa Rica (La Fortuna and Quepos/Manuel Antonio primarily). Our trip was in Early December and was probably the most amazing trip we have ever been on. I would highly recommend it to anyone.

I found so many helpful tips and info on Reddit before my trip to Costa Rica, I felt I had to share my experience here in hopes someone may benefit. This is my first Reddit post so bare with me.

PRE TRIP

Our phone service providers (Verizon and T Mobile) offer international data/text/call packages you can buy. We just bought those packages and had no issues with cell service. We still downloaded the areas we needed on google maps offline, so that we could use it in case our service cut out. We had no issues.

It was hard to determine what to pack, it rains off and on each day, but it‚Äôs also very humid and warm (near the equator). You want something that will keep you dry, but not something that will keep you hot. We ended up just bringing lightweight water resistant coats (which still totally soaked thru one day when it was pouring raining), pants for the hiking trails (to prevent bug bites, which we never seen bugs, likely due to all the rain), and then gym shorts and tank tops/t shirts (which I was the most comfortable in, even during the light rains). Make sure to bring your swim trunks/bathing suits! For shoes just hiking boots, tennis shoes, and flip flops.

The weather while we were there was unpredictable. The weather app each night would say that it is going to rain all day/all week. But then in reality it would rain a little in the morning, and a little at night, and was beautiful thru the day, or it was a pleasant/very light sprinkle thru the day. There was 1 day we got poured on, but we still had fun with it. When we asked some locals, they told us the weather is totally unpredictable. Good luck.

RENTAL CAR / DRIVING

We arrived at the SJO airport early at 6 AM,  the airport was small and easy to navigate. We decided to rent a car, because it was not very expensive (compared to paying for private drivers each time you need one), and it allowed us WAY more freedom to be able to go out and about and do activities whenever/wherever we wanted. We rented a car from a company called ‚ÄúVamos‚Äù, which was excellent. They picked us up from the airport and shuttled us across the street to their rental car office. They charge a $2000 deposit that gets refunded when you return the car. 

We rented a small car that did have 4x4, however we never needed to use the 4x4. I sure felt reassured having it just in case though! It was a little car and struggled on some of the steep inclines, but nothing we couldn‚Äôt manage. 

There was about a 3 or 4 hour drive from San Jose to La Fortuna area. Then was about a 5 or 6 hour drive from La Fortuna to Manuel Antonio. Then about another 5 hours back to SJO airport from Manuel Antonio (through the middle of the night) So, I had my fair share of time behind the wheel. Here are the main takeaways.

- All of the traffic signs are in Spanish (obviously), but I consider myself to be a good driver and I was able to adapt just fine. 

- I was warned about police pulling you over if you speed at all. Initially we did the speed limit/kept with the pace of traffic around us, which felt very slow. However there were a bunch of times where other people were speeding and/or passing right by us. Also there were many times where we would get stuck behind a motorcycle or a big truck that was going waaay too slow. We just got around them whenever it was safe. As I got more comfortable I kind of made my own speed limit based on what seemed normal from the other drivers I seen on the road. We never seen any police cars or had any issues.

- The roads are narrow and very curvy in some parts. Nothing completely outrageous, but not as big as what I was used to in the US. My girlfriend gets car sick but with some Dramamine she was fine. The roads were all paved just fine, occasionally there were roads that were in less than ideal shape, or full on dirt roads. Usually these were short lengths or totally avoidable. We stuck to paved roads 95% of the time.

- The potholes pop up on you quickly and out of nowhere. And also it rains often, so it will look like a small puddle, but actually will be a big pothole. Avoid these. Also definitely be cautious when it rains because some lanes on the road can become mostly or completely flooded, which you will have to briefly cross over into the opposing traffic lane to get around. We did see evidence of previous landslides that had been cleaned up off the road. At one point we there was a traffic stop because of construction crew cleaning up a landslide on the freeway which (fortunately) held us up only about 15 min until they let our lane move on. 

- On the freeway you will see traffic signs that say ‚ÄúCeda‚Äù which means yeild. This is a sign to merge lanes. It is a very abrupt merge, so be ready. Also there will be times where you have to cross over bridges that are only wide enough for 1 car. You have to wait your turn and allow the opposing traffic to pass, then you go. Kind of a ‚Äúwhoever got here first‚Äù type of situation. Use caution.

-  We used google maps the whole time and never had any issues with it. We downloaded the google maps offline to our phone so that we could use it without service or WiFi  if we needed to. There was only one time where google maps tried to take us up onto a weird rocky treacherous dirt road, which just looking at it there was no way we were going to last on. I just took a different route and there was no time difference in our ETA. 

- We ran over a nail and got a flat tire one of the days in La fortuna. We discovered the flat in the morning when we were ready to head out for the day. We changed the tire to the spare that was in the trunk, and were told to go down to the gas station and they will fix the tire. The first gas station we stopped at said they couldn‚Äôt help us, but sent us to another gas station where they did fix the tire. Costed about $5 USD. Less people really spoke English as we got to the outskirts of town, but still everyone was very helpful.

- Driving at night was not as scary as I had read online. There were definitely stretches of road that was very dark, but you throw your brights on and just be careful. Also there always seemed to be other cars on the road around us, even on our drive from midnight to 5 am from Manuel Antonio to SJO. 

- There were a handful of toll roads along the way on our travels. It had to be like 2 or 3 bucks USD to get thru. We used cash at some and card at others. 

ITINERARY 

The La Fortuna was our first stop. The area is not very big, but there is so so so much to see and do, which is amazing, because you can pack so much into each day without worrying too much about travel times.

Day 1 - breakfast and coffee at Red Frog coffee roasters, explore the little town area, settle into and get set up in Airbnb, and Baldi Hot springs, which was just the first hot springs we found (was awesome, until we found The Springs). Got some bomb quesobirria tacos at ‚ÄúMexicah Taqueria‚Äù. Just relaxed today because we were tired from the flight and the drive. 

Day 2 - coffee at a random coffee shop (there‚Äôs so many), Zip lining and ATV tours at ‚ÄúGo Adventure Arenal Park‚Äù (this was the day where we got totally rained on, we kept a good attitude, to be honest it added to the experience), lunch at ‚ÄúSoda el Arenal‚Äù (these people that own this place are so nice!!!!!) then we got a 2 day pass at ‚ÄúThe Springs‚Äù to enjoy the hot springs (this place was next level amazing, better than Baldi IMO), massage at Arenal Natural Spa, which is the best massage we ever had.

Day 3 - Mistico hanging bridges, which is kind of like a big nature reserve with paved walkways and like 10 bridges, was pretty cool. It was raining on us pretty hard while we were here as well, but we got some plastic ponchos and were fine. We decided not to do any more hikes because of the rain, and felt like the Mistico bridges park gave us what we wanted for hiking. We stopped for food on the way there and on the way back at random Sodas. Then we chilled at The Springs for the rest of the day, which was amazing being in the hot springs with the light rain. 

Day 4 - breakfast and coffee, Travel to Manuel Antonio (but we stayed in Quepos, which is a 10/15 min drive to Manuel Antonio). Stopped in Jaco for food at ‚ÄúEl Chicano Mexican Food‚Äù and walked on the beach for just a little bit to stretch the legs. Finished the rest of the drive and settled into our Airbnb in Quepos. Explored the Quepos town area, then got back to our place for some sleep.

Day 5 - Manuel Antonio National park. You have to make a reservation in advance online. You are not allowed to bring food/water into the park (unless in a non disposable water bottle). We got there early and were there for probably 8 hours. It was incredible. Think of awesome jungle hikes and a beautiful beach together in the same place. On the way in there will be multiple spots where people try to get you to park, just drive right by them. We parked in a lot nearby ‚ÄúRestaurante Donde Alex‚Äù (which we ate here after the park), and paid $20 cash for parking for the day if I remember correctly. It is as close as you can get to the park entrance. On the walk from the parking lot to the park entrance, there will be a bunch of people that try ask you if you need a guide inside the park, which may be helpful if you are into that type of thing and especially if you want to see wildlife. We decided not to get a guide. We were able to make our way all around the park no problem, and we seen all types of wildlife, monkeys, sloths, iguanas, birds, etc. we hiked around the park and hung out by the beach and it was awesome. Make sure you keep an eye on your bag if you leave it by the beach, the monkeys stole one or two other peoples bags.

Day 6 - We were so beat up tired from our trip that we just relaxed all day. Got massages, ate food (a good spot was ‚ÄúCoffee Stop‚Äù), did some gift shopping to bring stuff home for friends, hit the farmers market that was nearby (where we got the best hot sauce ever), and just took in the culture.

We left Quepos at Midnight to make it in time to return our rental car and get back to the airport for our 6 am flight back to LAX (I didn‚Äôt think this part though with the timing of everything, but we made it happen!). We got there a bit early, and had to wait for Vamos to open (which we called ahead and for a small fee they met us there early at 5 am and shuttled us to the airport). We got there early, and hung out at the Denny‚Äôs next door until the Vamos people got there. We returned the car and they took us to the airport no problems at all.


ADDITIONAL TIPS

- My girlfriend and I are big Foodies. The best part of the trip, was not the food. You can find good food definitely! But most places the food was just OK. I would not consider these areas to be ‚ÄúFoodie Destinations‚Äù by any means. ‚ÄúSodas‚Äù are local casual dining spots. Eat at the sodas. The food is cheap, the people are nice, and you get a real genuine vibe of Costa Rica people. ‚ÄúSoda el Arenal‚Äù in La Fortuna was our favorite spot, the best food, and the nicest people running the place. I tried to mention the spots that we got good food above.

- The Coffee, Chocolate, and hot sauces were amazing!!!! We brought a bunch home and we wish we had brought home more.

- We are not the types to do certain kinds of tours, as we can feel constrained and slowed down sometimes. We like to run around and do our own thing. We got to see a bunch of wildlife throughout our trip. We never went out specifically on any kind of tour or event to go see wildlife. It just happened naturally while we were doing other things. And it was raining, which usually keeps the animals from being out and about. I‚Äôm not sure if we just got lucky, or if that‚Äôs common. However I will admit, at Manuel Antonio national park, the guides there are next level. They are able to see things you would never see. If this is super important to you to see animals, get a guide at Manuel Antonio. As I stated above, there are people outside the park that offer to be your guide, there are also people INSIDE the park who actually work at the park, that  are available to be your guide.

- We did not get to do Tabacon hot springs in La Fortuna. We did not know that we needed reservations, and they were booked like a month or 2 out when I looked. Everyone talks about it being so legendary, which I‚Äôm sure it is. However, ‚ÄúThe Springs‚Äù was incredible, I can‚Äôt imagine how much better it can be. And they offer a 2 day pass that wasn‚Äôt very expensive, so it worked great for us to be able to pop in and out of the hot springs between our activities whenever we wanted.

- Obviously, you always have to be aware of your surroundings and watching out for anyone trying to jack you when you are traveling. We didn‚Äôt leave anything in the car unattended, and we didn‚Äôt bring anything around with us that we didn‚Äôt need to have. With that being said, I felt safer walking around Costa Rica in the middle of the night than I do walking around some parts of Los Angeles in the middle of the day. The locals in Costa Rica are all so nice. Everyone is very helpful. Even if they didn‚Äôt speak any English, they would still try to help point you in the right direction.

- We did not convert and cash (USD) to Colones (Costa rican currency). We used card most of the time, and cash some of the time. When I got home I realized that each time I swiped my card, there was a small ‚Äúinternational transaction fee‚Äù. Not crazy, but worth mentioning. Also, I believe that at some spots, you are charged more if using CC or USD vs using Colones. We didn‚Äôt have any issues, but worth mentioning.

- In all the main touristy areas, most people spoke English either very well, or OK enough. As you get away from the touristy areas, don‚Äôt be surprised if people look at you with a blank stare if you are not speaking Spanish! Even still, everyone was very helpful. We used google translate to get us by where we needed to.



10 out of 10 would recommend anyone go to Costa Rica. We only seen a fraction of the country, but we were blown away. The vibe, the people, the environment, the activities‚Ä¶ truly something special. 

I hope that this was helpful for anyone out there planning a trip. I am happy to answer any questions you may have or elaborate on anything as well.

Throwaway so get your 'this is fake because new account' comments out early.

I (32F) had a baby boy when I was 16. Yes, I know how that sounds like. No, we weren't careful. Judge me all you want on that front, I've dealt with that for years. Mike (33M) was my boyfriend then and when I found out about my pregnancy, he did a disappearing act with help from his family. Something something 'future college star' something.

My parents were always blunt: What happened next was my choice. After a lot of thinking, and deciding abortion just wasn't for me (I respect that right, I'm not here to debate it. It was just not for me), I chose to give up the baby for adoption. My parents knew a super sweet couple that were looking to adopt. We met and I just knew they were the right people. This turn from a teen mistake to an almost surrogacy. I started homeschool to finish my education and to have rest. The adoptive parents were with me for everything and even paid for most of the medical cost. The adoptive mother was a teacher, so she help me with my schoolwork and to prepare for college.

They were present for the birth and I refused to hold the baby. Instead, his actual mother did. And it was just right. I've stayed in the baby's life in a distant position as a 'special aunt'. Well, he's no longer a baby and he knows who I am, but his mom is the same woman that raised him and I continue to be his special aunt. The only change is now he knows who to call if he needs a kidney. His sense of humor is like mine, go figure. We talk maybe once in a blue moon, which in all honesty is the best. He's happy and I don't regret giving him up to have a happy life.

For my part, I married six years ago. My husband, Aaron, (44M) was divorce in good terms with Bella (40F). They have two children together. A boy that is 16 and a girl that is 19. Aaron made it clear since we began dating that his kids' approval was important and that Bella was part of his life forever. Not as a spouse but as a friend and mother to his children. I also told Bella and him about my teen pregnancy.

Well, to begin with the kids, my step-daughter and I get along well. She's obviously closer to her mother, but she still does 'girls' days with me every so often. It's more like friends though. My step-son is incredibly close to me. He calls me his 'other mom' and always asks me to be present for important events. We bonded when his childhood dog passed away, as my cat died about the same time.

Bella and I? We're best friends. I know people have complicated relationships with their partner's exes, but we always show respect to each other. I never tried to take her place. I know Aaron and her shared something special long before I was in the picture. That's their history. And I am a step-mom, not a mom. Her place in the kids' life is not up for competition.

The reason for this background is that the whole mess with Mike started when I took my step-son to a medical appointment. It wasn't serious, though he did have to use anesthesia. Aaron and Bella both couldn't get the day off. They tried, but their jobs are on call and they cannot easily take time off. So I went on my own to be my step-son's support. I didn't recognize Mike as one of the doctors. His real name, both first and last name, are incredibly common and it had been years. Not to mention my priority was being my step-son's support and everything else was secondary.

After my step-son was done, he was a bit out of it as expected. I was setting him up in the car and making sure he was comfortable when Mike came over. He told me he had been thinking about me and our 'son' for so long, and he was glad our boy was okay. It really took me a few minutes for my brain to click on what was going on and he kept on rambling about apologies and how he wasn't ready to be a father. Blah blah blah. Eventually I just sigh and loudly said: ""This is not the baby I was pregnant with. I gave him up for adoption after I gave birth. I am a step-mother."" My loopy step-son chimed in with: ""Other mom!"". I had to hold back a smirk to be honest.

Mike was stunned by that and it gave me time to catch him up on the important details. I gave up the baby, he knows what happened and why I gave him up, I married a man with two children, I am happy and don't want him in my life. And no, I won't give him contact information for the adoptive family. He is sixteen years too late. That was the end of it and I got into my car to get my step-son home to rest.

Since then Mike found me in social media and has been painting this sob story about me denying him a chance to be a father. How I was a poor mother that threw away her child to raise someone else's children. I'm basically the she-devil apparently. Most of our former classmates that saw the post reminded him that he LEFT me. Some of his HS friends even pointed out he laughed about leaving me pregnant. I didn't know that part.

A few of his relatives have reached out to bash me about taking Mike's chance to be a father. That it made me a 'poor Christian'. I'm not. I'm Jewish to begin with. A few friends did tell me it was a b\*tch move to give the baby up without telling Mike. I don't personally think I was in the wrong, but in case I decided to leave the judgement to the internet masses. So, reddit, AITA?

Clearing something out: The adoptive parents and bio-child have a phone number to contact Mike's parents if they want. I have no say if they do or not. I just won't give Mike any information on them.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: NTA

Hi, therapist here. Seems like it was the right decision for everyone involved!. Especially Mike, who clearly shouldn't 't be anywhere near children given his full lack of impulse control and empathy. As a fellow Jewish lady, I recommend laughing at the ""poor christian"" comments.

>**OOP:** My mom loves them. I'm in a mix household with Dad being Jewish and Mom being Catholic. My mom laughs every time I get a new one the hardest.

Commenter: I mean, they can be really funny depending on who's saying it. Also, who are these friends calling you a bitch? They don't sound like friends.

>**OOP:** They are more conservative friends. I say friend loosely. We're in the same groups.

Commenter: These people are fucking psycho. Block block block.¬†

Your bio kid might decide for himself to try and find his bio Dad one day, but it‚Äôs your job to defend his privacy until then. And make sure his decision is informed (i.e. he knows that his bio dad is a complete ass).

>**OOP:** I told him everything when his parents decided it was time to tell him who I was really. I didn't make Mike into a villain, just said he left after I told him I was pregnant and never reached out. He's been clear that while I am his biological mother and Mike is his biological father, he doesn't see either of us as parents. I am his aunt and Mike is a stranger.

Commenter: Nta.... tf? Also, I'm not judging you for the age gap, but I'm definitely judging Mike. Tell him if he and his friends don't leave you alone that you'll report him to the medical board.

Also, maybe ask your son if he wants Mike's contact info, but warn the parents he's bad news. It's your birth sons choice not yours.

>**OOP:** He's had Mike's info for years. Mainly via Mike's parents. I think he called them once and Mike wasn't around or something. I got the story second hand so I don't know the details.

*Funny comment about anesthesia:*

>Apparently I sang opera really badly when my wisdom teeth were removed. My step-son and I had a debate about why our dog should go to school in his place.

Commenter: Consult a lawyer about him talking sh\*t about you online. Medical board?

>**OOP:** In consideration. It hasn't damage my character per se considering he's being called out publicly. But him approaching at the hospital was weird. We're right now way too busy with another surgery on the schedule so legal stuff is in the backburner. And we are going to a different hospital.

Commenter: Warn the adoptive parents about the situation they have a right to know and can protect the child

>**OOP:** Already done. They do live in another state so that gives them some space.

Commenter: \[...\] One thing... Knowing nothing about how this works, I assume you were able to get Mike's parental rights terminated given that he left? If not it I wonder if it makes sense to give the adoptive family a heads up that he's coming out of the woodwork.¬†

>**OOP:** This was a tough situation because he wasn't around and no one in his family willingly gave a DNA sample to establish parenthood. The judge that did the adoption could have demanded it, but she decided for the good of the baby and myself to just terminate both of our rights. And then the baby was adopted. I was basically deemed unfit and the father was not able to be contacted. And the court did try really hard to get him.  
*To another commenter:*  
It wasn't done with his consent. He was MIA. When the adoption process began, we tried to reach out and his family didn't even hold a conversation. The judge involved tried to have the courts contact him and he didn't respond either. Eventually the abandonment time frame was hit and his right were terminated for abandonment. Mine were willingly terminated since I presented myself as an unfit mother.  
*One more commenter:*  
This was a pain to do. It mainly fell down on abandonment. We had to prove we tried to contact the father. The court had to try to contact the father. And we had to wait for a set time requirement. I just had the right judge that understood I wasn't prepared to be a mother and decided to set things appropiately.

*Their relationship:*

>Oh I don't mind it at all. I wanted him to never see me as his mom. I wanted him to love his family. I'm happy beyond reasons that his life is great because I am not in it beyond a call here and there. He's an amazing young man and its because he has amazing parents. I do get moments of pain here and there, and then I remember this kid had the best possible life.  
I wasn't good for him. And he wasn't good for me. It's a sad reality. I don't reget it and I'm glad I was able to bring him for his parents to have him in their lives.

*Mike was one of the doctors for your step-son's surgery?*

>He wasn't one of our doctors. Just a doctor in the hospital. I spent like two hours in the waiting room so I suspect he recognized me. His name was in a plaque with all the doctors' names and I didn't even put 2 and 2 together. I should have, I was just stressed and not really thinking.

Commenter: I'm sorry... I reread this three times looking for the part where you said you and your family moved away and changed all your identities. NOPE! I don't see that anywhere.

So, this ""college star"" and his scumbag family knew EXACTLY WHERE YOU WERE AND HOW TO FIND YOU FOR THE LAST 16 FUCKING YEARS... and yet YOU'RE the ""monster"" who denied him a chance to get to know his son and ""be the dad he was destined to be""?

Oh, that's just fucking rich. What a bunch of complete asswipes. Don't let him or his douchebag family anywhere near your son or his adoptive parents.

>**OOP:** I didn't even go out of state for college. Went to the local university in town. And this isn't a massive city either.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1iin8vj/aita_for_denying_my_ex_his_son_after_he_abandoned/)**: February 5, 2025 (17 days later)**

This is probably the one and only update I'll be doing. Because to be honest, I got other things to do and I have my main reddit account for lurking.

I'm going to start with the important matter: A lot of people were worried about my biological kid and what he wished when it came to Mike. Well, I got his permission to post this. He spoke to Mike once a few days after I told him where he could find Mike. I won't share all the details, only the final decision. There won't be any more contact between them. The kid doesn't want a second dad and Mike wasn't willing to be in his life unless he had the position of 'dad'. So he's going no contact with Mike. There was more to it, but its very personal and I feel it's not my place to share it. The kid and I will continue to have a relationship as Aunt and nephew. And he knows whatever he needs medically, I'll always be first in line to give blood, kidney, etc.

For those wondering why Mike is so big into contact with the kid I found out a few details via his friends. Mike can have more kids. He just hasn't had a stable relationship in years. Which I can believe since I finally had enough and decided to accept going to have coffee with him to get some things squared away. My husband came of course, but he sat in another table to let me deal with it. I asked him to.

The conversation was a shit show, to be honest. Mike brought me flowers and chocolate covered strawberries, my old favorites. He treated it all like some date. I nip that bud immediately. I introduced my husband and told him we were very much in love and happy, so I don't appreciate any atttempts at unwanted romance.

Once we sat down, he started by telling me what I knew about him having failed relationships. That he felt no woman could meet his standards for a wife and mother to his children since he already saw me as that. He claims he feels guilty for choosing college over me and our baby. He was well aware of the court dates regarding custody and that I was trying to put the baby up for adoption. When he saw me taking care of my stepson, he thought I had chickened out of giving the baby away. Seeing me be all caring of 'our baby boy' made him think how great it would be if the three of us could be a family, and maybe have a bigger family down the road. He had the gall to ask me if I would consider divorcing my husband and try to fight for custody of 'our son'.

I have to admit, I laughed in his face. I probably was overly cruel, but I had years of stress, heartache, and judgemental encounters to drop on him. I told him all I saw in him was a coward. A coward that instead of staying to make adult decisions decided to run with help of mommy and daddy. That any love I had for him died the day I had to push out a full human being and instead of knowing I had support from him, there was a big empty spot where the 'dad' was supposed to be. That I almost ruined my life and had to throw away prom, senior pictures, and even graduation, because I was far too pregnant to party, appear on the yearbook or walk into stage to get my diploma. He got to party and enjoy life while I had to fight tooth and nail for an inch of respect, yet we both had unprotected sex. The only difference is his d\*ck wasn't big enough to pop a baby out or satisfy a woman to begin with (That was a bit mean, but not sorry).

After I calmed down, I simply told him I had a happy life with a man that loves me. Great step-kids that are the greatest gift. A best friend who lets me be a stepmom to her children. A nephew who I adore and who despite our history as biological mother and child, he still loves me as his special aunt rather than hate me. My family is perfect because he's not part of it and I have no intentions to live in his fantasy. And that I can't wait to get pregnant with my husband's child to add to that perfection.

I also told him to leave the our biological kid alone. He has made his choice and it is up to him if he ever reaches out for Mike. And also let him know I would be making a formal complaint to his hospital for his harrassment.

Good thing my husband took screenshots, because by the time we got home, Mike had deleted all the posts. A lot of his former friends did repost screenshots making fun of him. The silver line in all of this is that I have reconnected with my high school classmates and to be honest, they are great people. Seems Mike is in a handful that stayed in his 'school hype' mindset.

It's been about three days and no signs of Mike. My husband did get the biggest ego boost when he overheard me going off on Mike and has been insufferable, in a good way. So, there's mostly good news. Hopefully one of these days we'll get even more good news since we actually are excited at the idea of having a baby together.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Regarding him asking you to divorce your husband and fight together for ‚Äúour son‚Äù, outside of getting physical, there‚Äôs practically no ‚Äúoverreaction‚Äù to that.

>**OOP:** I almost got physical to be honest. But I had my nails just done. He wasn't worth breaking a nail.

Commenter: Very few things are worth breaking a nail, but hon, breaking one to hurt that bastard would have been one of those things.

>**OOP:** Yeah, but he's not worth the 150 bill. He wasn't even worth the 14 dollars bill at the cafe.  
*OOP explains:*  
It was an anniversary gift from my step-daughter. Normally my nails are like... 40 maybe? xD

Commenter: Of course he didn‚Äôt pick up the check!

>**OOP:** Oh we left before and I paid my part and my husbands. Don't know if he paid his.

Commenter: Did he at least leave those strawberries for your husband to feed to while you recline in bed?

>**OOP:** Nah, we left them on the table for him with the flower. My husband bought me my current favorite. Macadamias covered in chocolate.",121,1739338873.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,10,0.96,False

[Sage Barista Pro],"Hey everyone! Something exciting happened‚Äîmy GF, a lifelong non-coffee drinker, told me she *might* be starting to like coffee! üéâ

The catch? She finds the espresso from our **Sage Barista Pro** way too bitter. My initial thought was, *""Well, that's just how espresso is,""* but I‚Äôd rather adjust and have her enjoy it than insist on my current setup.

Right now, my go-to recipe is:  
‚òï **Dose:** 16-17g  
üìè **Yield:** \~38g (1:2.3 ratio)  
‚è≥ **Pre-infusion:** \~9s  
‚åõ **Total extraction time:** 24.5s

I personally like a **larger volume** in the cup (not just a tiny ristretto), so I‚Äôve been trying to extend the extraction. But maybe that‚Äôs what's making it too bitter?

# The Dilemma

How can I tweak the setup to suit her taste without completely losing what I enjoy? I figure grinding coarser might help (for both of us), but adjusting the grinder frequently seems impractical. Are there **easier setting adjustments** we can make on the Sage Barista Pro that would allow us to switch between her preferred taste and mine without too much hassle?

And as I'm about to go the manager says we didn't have it. He had been eavesdropping the whole time (another things he's started doing since the beginning the year).

""true"" fix for loneliness & wish there was....","I think most of us wish there was a better fix for loneliness... we lie in are beds listen to sad songs & reminisce about simpler times, ;/ but its hard to tackle loneliness by oneself.... truly what is the answer to this biggest mystery of feeling discouraged, or broken or unloved? why are we not worthy of genuine connections?

**how do you go on when you feel so miserable or alone?**

We all¬†have some twisted thinking to overcome or change, and as humans we really seem to be stuck with goals, life, happiness, or travel, as we are almost shown in most places as a weak & selfish species but its not all easy to crawl out from the age of sadness it can be hard to keep going.

The sad part is that this happens because the level of stress we face daily, mostly from jobs, the apps we use, health, family or other problems, most of us commonly accepted being alone.... now what really sucks is being alone for multiple months with no warmth or support... the level of true commitment being what size apartments we live in, visiting our families, hobbies and meeting friends at a coffee shop, if we will ever be happy and find a decent relationship how will that play out? and will it determine our lives being truly fulfilled. In other words how many people are there in the groups we have to be around or experience this, such as school events, clubs, or meetups. I think the mid 2000s was a bigger time for interaction we didn't have to worry about ppl overdosing, or bad groups, or good friendships, as we were carefree as the younger generation tends to be. We still may have made mistakes some idiot jock.... makes a mockery of himself by going ""bruh"" every ten minutes trying to be the cool one in the school¬†hierarchy. we prolly lost our friends, we cried at a film, we had drama at school or did nonsense because this was a era where we didn't lose connections or weren't lonely in some ways before the rise of the internet.

Growing up is also hard because the world always changes the kid outside who played magic with a stick pretending to be a sword, becomes a Dr, or a journalist, no longer having imagination or trying to feel some form of connection. Individuals have the power to define themselves and their actions, regardless of their perceived nature or external pressures, essentially choosing their journey, the kid in your yearbook who you may have liked has moved on & left your town feeling somber wishing you could have been happy with them or go back in time to swoop them off your feet. ;=; you feel empty trying to fill your inner void.

Vulnerability & being shy are tricky because you could feel like the ugly duckling or a outcast some days you feel more lonely as you get older when does it really hit you the most.. ;/

Language is entirely a social construct we use it every day, we go to school we have our high school phases are nerdy phases and then our adult phases where we struggle to make ends meet but its hard to find people who understand your life and your own loneliness, or both supporting one another.

Humans, being mammals are both social and individualist creatures, like all mammals. Social meaning we don‚Äôt even have high level thinking without language and society. If you grow up in the jungle by yourself you will not be able to think, because language gives you the abstract concepts to be able to think. Without language you don‚Äôt have a whole lot of abstract concepts in your brain so I think the way we learn or interact can be a curse or a blessing both ways & can be a curse if we don't truly feel like our guard can come down. getting friend-zoned sucks when you like someone who doesn't like you back. Genes and good looks are not always the best traits, while we mostly cling to the person who has a good fashion sense or nice hair. not all of us are perfect & feel alone.

**The biggest question remains...** Why do we feel so desperate to care or hurt every day, at times im sad & unloved, you can find someone you fancy and think hey they seem cool, but one wrong move and you mess up your approach or feel shy.... or they are out of my league. ;/ it sucks getting a broken heart is painful because your brain cant hurt you emotionally & mentally it can start to make you doubt why your tried to talk to the one who got away. ;=; ;=;....... this life we are in, is strange The natural state of nature is cheap to create... but costly to overcome, you can drown yourself & drink all the alcohol & get wasted, or be sober... but love isn't easy to find or feel severely lonely. Loneliness just fades in life. Fairy tales are just lies we are told no prince will save you, no magic beans, or spells to fix your woes or wishes.

Yall ever feel just too sad... cuz l know that even while I try, I am nothing & wont be anything, loneliness is like a drug it kicks you & takes you with it. Maybe we don‚Äôt matter & in a billion years... some life form will find us & be better then how we are today but its sad to wonder how we fix loneliness or feel like we can all get a hug or a gold star for trying. It's hard to wonder how we can not be lonely. ;/ its hard to keep going when the world we saw has drastically changed financially, or finding a better mindset that is¬†of ones happiness & wellbeing, while feeling or developing hardships or trauma from these hard times. Anyway thats just a vent on how sad loneliness can change oneself. the phenomenon¬†of loneliness is everywhere we go.... it sucks to be alone.",4,1739337011.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

1injf8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FranceRent/comments/1injf8b/cannes_where_glamour_meets_mediterranean_charm/,Cannes: Where glamour meets Mediterranean charm,"**The French Riviera has long been synonymous with elegance, luxury, and sun-soaked beaches. Among its glittering coastal gems, one city stands out as a true icon of glamour and cinematic prestige. Cannes, with its palm-lined promenades and star-studded legacy, beckons visitors to indulge in a slice of the good life on the shores of the Mediterranean.**

As the sun rises over the azure waters of the Bay of Cannes, the city awakens to a day filled with possibility. The gentle lapping of waves against the shore is accompanied by the clinking of coffee cups in sidewalk cafes and the soft padding of joggers along La Croisette, the city's famous waterfront boulevard.

**A Red Carpet Welcome**

Cannes' identity is inextricably linked to the world-renowned Cannes Film Festival. For two weeks each May, the city is transformed into the epicenter of the global film industry. The Palais des Festivals et des Congr√®s, a modernist behemoth overlooking the harbor, becomes the focal point of this cinematic extravaganza. Its famous red-carpeted steps have been graced by countless stars, their images forever etched in the annals of film history.

Even outside of festival season, the spirit of cinema permeates the city. Handprints of film legends can be spotted along the All√©e des √âtoiles du Cin√©ma, Cannes' own walk of fame. Movie buffs might catch a glimpse of a familiar facade from ""To Catch a Thief"" or ""The Transporter,"" as the city's picturesque settings have long been favored by filmmakers.

**Beyond the Silver Screen**

While the film festival may be Cannes' claim to fame, the city offers much more than just Hollywood glamour. Le Suquet, the old town, provides a stark contrast to the modern opulence of La Croisette. Here, narrow cobblestone streets wind their way up to the 11th-century Tour du Mont Chevalier, offering panoramic views of the bay and the L√©rins Islands beyond.

The March√© Forville, a covered market in the heart of the city, is where the real Cannes can be experienced. Local producers display an array of fresh Proven√ßal produce, fragrant herbs, and regional specialties. The market is frequented by both celebrated chefs and home cooks alike, all in search of the finest ingredients for their Mediterranean-inspired dishes.

**Island Escapes**

A short boat ride from the Vieux Port transports visitors to the tranquil L√©rins Islands. √éle Sainte-Marguerite, the larger of the two, is home to the Fort Royal, where the mysterious Man in the Iron Mask was once imprisoned. Today, the island is a haven for nature lovers, with its forested trails and secluded coves perfect for swimming and picnicking.

The smaller √éle Saint-Honorat has been home to a community of Cistercian monks since the 5th century. Their ancient abbey and the more recent 19th-century fortified monastery can be explored, offering a peaceful retreat from the bustle of the mainland.

**Luxurious Pursuits**

Cannes' reputation for luxury is well-deserved. The city's high-end boutiques and designer stores line La Croisette and the Rue d'Antibes, catering to a clientele accustomed to the finer things in life. The city's grand hotels, such as the Carlton and the Martinez, stand as monuments to Belle √âpoque elegance, their terraces offering prime people-watching spots.

For those seeking to try their luck, the Casino Barri√®re les Princes and Casino Croisette offer gaming tables and slot machines in opulent surroundings. The thrill of the roulette wheel is amplified by the knowledge that James Bond himself might have placed a bet here in ""GoldenEye.""

**Culinary Delights**

Cannes' gastronomic scene is a reflection of its cosmopolitan nature and Mediterranean setting. Michelin-starred restaurants sit alongside family-run bistros, all celebrating the bounty of the region. Fresh seafood, locally-sourced produce, and Proven√ßal herbs feature prominently on menus across the city.

A meal at La Palme d'Or, the two-Michelin-starred restaurant at the Martinez Hotel, is considered a culinary pilgrimage for many food enthusiasts. For a more laid-back experience, the restaurants along the Rue Saint Antoine in Le Suquet offer traditional Proven√ßal fare with a side of old-town charm.

**Beaches and Beyond**

Cannes' beaches are divided between public and private, with the latter often attached to the luxury hotels along La Croisette. These offer amenities like sun loungers, umbrellas, and beachside service for a fee. The public beaches, while more crowded, provide a more democratic sun-soaking experience.

For those looking to venture beyond the city limits, Cannes serves as an excellent base for exploring the French Riviera. The hilltop village of Mougins, once home to Picasso, is just a short drive away. The perfume capital of Grasse, with its fragrant fields and historic distilleries, offers a sensory journey into the world of scent.

As the sun sets over the Mediterranean, painting the sky in hues of pink and gold, Cannes transforms once again. The nightlife comes alive, with beachfront clubs and sophisticated bars offering entertainment into the small hours. Whether it's a quiet drink on a hotel terrace or dancing under the stars, the city caters to all tastes.

Cannes, with its unique blend of glamour, history, and natural beauty, continues to captivate visitors from around the world. It's a place where the spirit of the Riviera is distilled into its purest form ‚Äì a city that celebrates life's pleasures against a backdrop of stunning Mediterranean vistas. For those seeking a taste of the high life or simply a sun-soaked escape, Cannes stands ready to welcome them with open arms and a touch of star-studded magic.

While Cannes offers a unique blend of glamour and Mediterranean charm, those looking to explore more of France's diverse cities might consider a visit to¬†[Lyon](https://francerent.com/destinations/Lyon), where culinary traditions and rich history create an equally captivating urban experience.

I went to lunch with my partner to a place I have frequented before. We haven't had any issues previously and expected another unremarkable afternoon there today. We ordered a meal that came with chips (fries as some call it) and onion rings. After what seemed like 45 mins or so, our meal came without our accompaniments. They told us that the fryers were backed up and our fries/chips would come shortly. As we were nearing the end of our meal, our chips finally arrives and they are drenched in oil and soggy. 

We did a short back and forth, I said I am not eating this. He said the same. We were both annoyed and he said he can't believe he paid this much for this, I said well, we have to send it back. He said let's just leave and go home and write a bad review. I said no, I am not doing that. I'm going to get my money back now. I took it back to them and they looked at it and said ..'yeah that's soggy' let me replace it and we ended up getting a free coffee and cake. We left satisfied with that outcome because I gave them a chance to recover the bad service and they took that chance to remedy the situation. 

For context, I work in the service industry. Feedback like these are my bread and butter. I will never scoff or call someone a Karen if they approach me kindly and give me a chance to fix something. We are all human at the end of the day and none of us are perfect. Before writing a business or person off, always allow them a chance to fix the issue instead of ranting and raving about it afterwards. A Google review is just an online equivalent of throwing your fist in the air and shouting an empty threat from your lawn.

I have been trying to increase my protein intake so I have been making shakes daily with 40g of protein and a whole cup of zucchini!

I learned that caffeine and pcos don‚Äôt mix well and I don‚Äôt drink much caffeine anymore in general anymore. I might have a black tea in the morning during the week and maybe one cup of coffee on the weekends. I have also read that having caffeine first thing in the morning can really mess with insulin levels and hormones.

As far as caffeine goes, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fine since it will be the only caffeine I‚Äôll have in the day.

I have tried reading through many, many posts, but I don't know where to start. My mom is a RAKA (if I have that right? Right leg above the knee amputee??)

She had her surgery last September, considered fully healed in. October, but wasn't given compression stockings till more recently. The one that she was given/ suggested/ sold,  was over $100 and changed $5 between one room and the next. My dad just brushed it off, but my mom and I are both irked over the principal of it to say the least.
So I would like to see what I can help her find. I know the size they fit her for. She has no issue remeasureing herself as necessary. 
She WANTS to wear it/ one, as this is necessary for her to get her prosthetic,  but the one they provided her, cuts into her upper thigh, and will cut her skin if she leaves it too long. It is a rather narrow elastic at the top edge. Ottobock was that brand. 
Please explain these to me like I'm 5, i haven't been at the appts with my mom and didn't know till today that she was having these issues. I went over for coffee.

I (21M) have a pitch for why [solidcore] is the ideal first date (I promise it‚Äôs not as unhinged as you think):

    1. Instant Vulnerability Test ‚Äì Within five minutes, we‚Äôll both be shaking, sweating, and questioning our life choices. If they can handle seeing me at my absolute weakest (literally collapsing on sweatlana), they‚Äôre a keeper.

    2. Blue lights make you look better - The blue lights do wonders, so look your best for the first date (hide the pain üòç)

    3. No Small Talk, Just Pain ‚Äì Forget awkward silence; the only words exchanged will be groans. Mutual suffering = bonding experience.

    4. You Immediately See Who‚Äôs Competitive ‚Äì Are they keeping up? Are they trying too hard? Are they secretly already going to solidcore‚Ä¶.

    5. Post-Workout Date is Built-In ‚Äì we are both already in athleisure, so casual coffee after is easy. 

    6. Survival Trauma Bonds People ‚Äì If you can make it through 50 minutes of non-stop tension together, a relationship might not be so hard after all.

    7. Good Excuse for Future Dates ‚Äì ‚ÄúWanna go again next week?‚Äù If they say yes, you‚Äôve found someone who enjoys suffering with you. That‚Äôs true love.

So that‚Äôs my pitch and I‚Äôm not kidding (I need to find my husband at [solidcore]). anyways, thank you for coming to my ted talk üôè

I haven't had an episode in a bit and baselines has been feeling fairly comfortable.  I'd say I'm typically more meh than up. But there's a few things that I'm wondering about recently if it's related to bipolar or not?

I tend to move pretty frequently like every 6 months to a year. I get bored or agitated or just crave change. My son is 20 months (just over 1.5 yrs. I moved when I got pregnant.

I‚Äôve always tried to keep it civil, but she wouldn‚Äôt and has always been rude to me and would try and speak on my behalf as if she‚Äôs my lawyer. To make things relevant, I‚Äôm on the spectrum. She will constantly convince me to say no whenever others ask me a question, tell me to ‚Äúshut up‚Äù whenever I talk to my friends or anyone that wanted to have a conversation with me, or my sister will shake her head no either because she disapproves of something or she simply wants me to shut the fuck up. 

This past weekend, my parents asked me and my sister to meet with them at a restaurant for dinner as we didn‚Äôt see each other in weeks and my parents both wanted to treat us. We met them in the restaurant and everything went well until it was time to order. I‚Äôm not much of an eater so I wanted to order some of the appetizers, but my parents encouraged me to buy an entree so I can have some food to take home if I don‚Äôt finish. I thought about getting it but I saw my sister just shaking her head. I asked her what her issue was and she said that she knows I don‚Äôt need the entree and therefore, I shouldn‚Äôt waste money or food. My parents told her that isn‚Äôt her concern and I can order for myself. I ordered the entree I liked and when our food came, my sister was glaring at me the entire time. I finished my food and I guess I didn‚Äôt really need to take leftovers home since they were all gone lol. When asked if we wanted dessert, my dad asked me if I would like some. I said I was full but my dad said he‚Äôd want me to at least take something home so I ordered a cheesecake. That was when my sister snapped. She called me a spoiled brat for wasting food and our father‚Äôs money and why do I fucking need dessert? My dad told my sister to calm down and said she can get dessert, too. My sister got even more angry and called me names such as a fat pig (I‚Äôm around 115 so not even close), a yes-woman whatever the fuck that means, and how I‚Äôm wasting money. I make my own money so idk what her issue was. I didn‚Äôt want to be around her so I just got up and left. My parents begged me to stay as we planned to get coffee somewhere else after but I declined. I couldn‚Äôt stay if my sister was gonna continue to be there. I even changed my mind on dessert. 

When I got home, I‚Äôve gotten a couple of calls from my parents apologizing on my sisters behalf and my mom said I shouldn‚Äôt have walked out and let my sister get the better of me. She tends to defend my sister a lot so I told her she needed to wake up and understand how my sister has always tried to control me for reasons I can‚Äôt understand.

1inj9zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPAP/comments/1inj9zs/the_unexpected_benefits_of_cpap_a_lifechanging/,The Unexpected Benefits of CPAP ‚Äì A Life-Changing Experience,"When I first got my CPAP machine, I had no idea how much of a difference it would make. Like many, I hesitated at first‚Äîwondering if it would actually help or just be another failed attempt at better sleep. I had searched everywhere for a real solution to my constant exhaustion, but nothing seemed to work. Now, after a few weeks of consistent use, I can confidently say CPAP has changed my life in ways I never expected.

**Waking Up Refreshed for the First Time in Years**  
Before CPAP, I‚Äôd wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed. No amount of coffee or extra sleep helped. Now, I wake up feeling like I actually rested‚Äîno more grogginess, no more dragging myself through the day.

**No More Midday Crashes**  
I used to hit a wall every afternoon, struggling to stay awake at work or while driving. Since starting CPAP, I can power through my day without that overwhelming urge to nap. My energy is steady, and I feel like I have my life back.

**Less Anxiety and Irritability**  
I didn‚Äôt realize how much my lack of sleep was affecting my mood. I was constantly anxious, snapping at people over small things. But now, I feel more in control, calmer, and genuinely happier.

**Sharper Focus and Mental Clarity**  
Brain fog used to be my biggest frustration. I‚Äôd forget simple things, struggle to focus at work, and feel like I was constantly in a daze. Since using CPAP, my mind is clearer, and I can actually think straight.

For anyone who has tried everything but still struggles with exhaustion, snoring, or waking up gasping for air‚Äîthis might be the solution you‚Äôve been looking for. I wish I had known sooner how much of a difference CPAP would make. If you‚Äôre unsure, give it a real shot‚Äîit could change everything.

I removed a lot of stuff to make it more readable, including details about the cities I visited in Colombia. That **much** longer version [is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1ij5pbd/colombia_trip_2_6_cities_11_weeks_2900_hours_on/).

**A few notes**

* I don‚Äôt use Spanish in my posts, unless talking about the names of things; food, TV shows and the like
* I don‚Äôt record myself speaking as I value my anonymity
* I don‚Äôt share details of my teachers
* I didn't use Google Translate during conversations unless mentioned

**Background**  
This is my second trip to Colombia. I was at around 1,250 hours when I arrived the first time and you can see a more [detailed account here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1bipd8c/how_my_trip_to_colombia_feels_at_level_6/).

I was at just over 2,900 hours of input when I arrived in late November. Keep in mind I have both ADHD and Asperger‚Äôs syndrome and have always had learning difficulties. In other words, I‚Äôd expect that most people would be more advanced with the same number of hours.

**Why I chose Colombia**  
I didn't need Spanish in my daily life and chose to learn it because I think it's a beautiful language. That resulted in some motivation issues soon after I first started to use DS. I booked my first trip to give myself a reason to focus. I chose Colombia because of the country‚Äôs clear accents, the fact that Colombians pronounce every letter in words and they generally speak much more slowly than Spaniards. If you're thinking of going to Colombia and Latam in general, keep safety in mind. If you have travelled a lot and take basic precautions, you‚Äôll likely be fine. Make sure you do plenty of your own research, though.

# Speaking progress

I was at a low A2 level when I arrived in Colombia in March 2024. Although I could function in restaurants, cafes and have pretty basic conversations with my hosts, people had to politely put up with my awful pronunciation and terrible grammar. Additionally, some people simply didn‚Äôt understand me.

Almost no one in Colombia seemed to have problems understanding me this time. There was one exception, but we‚Äôll get to that. My pronunciation in particular has improved *a lot*. I am also now able to use a much broader range of conjugations with ease. Embarrassingly, I conjugated everything for the present tense last time.

My teacher said I was a little below a B1 speaking level on arrival for this second trip. From what I‚Äôve read, a B1 requires mastery of around 9 sets of conjugations. I‚Äôd say I could confidently and reliably use 5 or 6 at the time. My pronunciation also still needed a lot of work. Both of these things improved during the trip.

# Speaking benchmarks

It‚Äôs easy to check my progress with listening; I just watch an episode from a few specific shows every 500 hours of input. That‚Äôs not possible with speaking. For that reason, I returned to both El Poblado and Bogot√°. This allowed me to test myself via conversations with the Airbnb hosts I met last time. Unfortunately, the guy in El Poblado is young, out a lot and I didn‚Äôt speak to him much. However, my hosts in the capital seemed very impressed with the difference. They complimented my phrasing and conjugations multiple times, as well as my vocabulary. This was my second Airbnb in Bogot√° and the last stop in Colombia. So I‚Äôd been waiting to hear that the entire time.

# ‚ÄúLiving‚Äù in Colombia

I don‚Äôt generally do touristy things when I visit Colombia. Being a freelancer means I have to work and there‚Äôs also going to the gym to try and not gain too much weight from the wide variety of delicious things Colombia has to offer. Thus, my trips to Colombia so far have been more akin to living/existing there than being a tourist. Work for me is teaching English. With students mostly in European time zones, I generally have to be up to work between midnight and 03:00. That usually means no energy for day trips, if I even have the time.

I‚Äôm happy to simply exist in Colombia. Going to bakeries and restaurants and interacting with locals is what I like. The main attraction is obviously using the beautiful language in real situations and being surrounded by it every day.

**Tourism**  
As I said, I didn‚Äôt do many touristy things during this trip for the aforementioned¬† reasons. I did little things, but one day trip stood out in particular.

Minca is a beautiful area around 50 minutes from Santa Marta. I took a guided tour of the area.

I was fortunate to be in a very small group, with just me and two Brazaillians. The tour had options and I made clear that I‚Äôd prefer Spanish. The guide did switch to English at times. Primarily when explaining detailed things about plants and endemic species in the country. Plus when he talked about the history of chocolate and the coffee making process. *However*, I‚Äôd say about 65% of the things he said were in Spanish during the roughly 6-hour experience with him. I had no problems understanding him and he clearly understood me well.

Additionally, I managed to communicate in Spanish with the Brazilians and I only switched to English twice to explain a couple of things I knew I couldn‚Äôt in Spanish. They were obviously not native speakers and didn‚Äôt know some words I couldn‚Äôt remember at the time. It was both a success in terms of my Spanish and also a really great day in terms of learning about Colombia.

# Big wins during this trip

**A locked out neighbour**  
Someone in one of my Medell√≠n Airbnbs locked himself out of his room. He used my phone to contact the owner,¬† but we talked about the situation 100% in Spanish. He was a tourist from elsewhere in Colombia and said his English was worse than my Spanish. Some hand gestures were involved, but we had no problems communicating based purely on what I knew.

**Getting lost**  
I got lost pretty badly while trying to find an Airbnb in the BA zone in Medell√≠n. I wandered around for 50 minutes due to a street numbering system that seemed to also confuse locals. 3 local people tried to help me during this time and we had no real problems communicating. I may have missed the odd word here or there, but no issues. My host eventually spotted me. I did have to use Google Translate for a few words that she sent in messages, as I turned off the translate option in Airbnb before the trip started.

**An early lesson without coffee**  
I stupidly forgot to take some instant coffee with me from one city to another. This mistake was a win because I had a 02:00 Spanish lesson the next day, without caffeine. Although I had to use Google Translate more than usual, I was pretty pleased that I communicated fairly well with my teacher. As a side note, I rarely use Google Translate with my teacher now. It's reached the point that I'd rather use a less than ideal word I know/rephrase things or ask her for the term by describing what I mean in Spanish. 

**A cancelled flight**  
One of my 15 flights was cancelled. This meant dealing with an airline's customer service in Bogot√° airport. He insisted on speaking English, I imagine to avoid any possibility of confusion. I insisted on replying in Spanish because duh lol. He clearly understood me and I got a replacement flight.

The fairly substantial delay led to me meeting two women from France. I initially met the ‚Äúreal‚Äù French woman. Then her friend - born in Colombia and of course a native speaker - joined us. The first woman's Spanish was okay, but she seemed to struggle with both English and Spanish. More so with English, though, so we used Spanish. We talked for about 10 minutes and it was fine.

Her friend talked with me for a good 20 minutes and I only needed to use an English word three times. She joked after a while that my English was better than my Spanish, but complimented me on my Spanish when I told her it must be a pain to tolerate me speaking.

She essentially said that she had no problem understanding me and that my sentence construction was good and phrases sounded natural. She may have just been being polite, but the compliment wasn't huge, so it felt real. That's also what my teacher sometimes says, so I'll take it as a win. To me, the phrases part is a benefit of changing my input months ago to almost 100% Colombian sources. Hearing so much slang and phrases from people from the country has clearly shaped how I think in the language.

**Being more right than a ‚Äúlocal‚Äù**  
As you can imagine, each region‚Äôs Spanish is chock full of local phrases that don‚Äôt make sense when translated. When in a restaurant in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood, I employed a phrase that translates as ‚Äúhow much do I carry?‚Äù but is simply another way of asking how much the bill is. I was told *very* confidently by a waiter that I was wrong. He knew I‚Äôd only been speaking the language since January 2024 and he was convinced he was right. I‚Äôve heard this phrase *dozens* of times in Colombian telenovelas and have used it in other restaurants without issue. I later explained the situation to my teacher and she said he was wrong and probably from Venezuela.

# Listening/understanding locals & confidence

If you‚Äôve read my [most recent progress report](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1hc9pfa/thoughts_listening_comprehension_comparison_at/), it would be fair to expect that I was able to understand people who spoke to me normally. The fact that I‚Äôm not a native speaker is obvious and people often subconsciously adjust how they speak to accommodate non-native speakers. That¬† aside, yes. I‚Äôd say I understood around 90% or more of what Colombian locals said to me during this trip. Success!

I only started using DS in late February 2023 and I could understand 90% of what people were saying. That‚Äôs pretty good!

Keep in mind that some of these issues - my pronunciation, forgetting words at times and occasionally not understanding - could be down to tiredness. I have a lot of students in Europe and had to teach lessons from midnight at times during this trip. Add to that not sleeping well for the first few days and I could have been a little off at times. An[ example of this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1gzraew/that_time_when_i_had_to_fight_my_brain_to_speak/) is that one of the conversations I had with an Uber driver was a mix of English and Spanish. I was simply too tired to function in the latter and I did intend on using English with him. However, Spanish kept coming out as I tried to speak English. Make of that what you will.

**Being misunderstood**  
Although my pronunciation has improved a *lot*, I'm still misunderstood at times. I used to screw up the pronunciation of i and e in Spanish a *lot*. I also sometimes pronounce sounds as I would in English. In other words, subconsciously combining letters, rather than pronouncing each letter individually. I‚Äôve been working on both of those things and they were less of an issue at the end of the trip than it was at the start. I also almost universally refuse to use translation tools during face-to-face conversations. I‚Äôd rather screw up in the moment and mentally chastise myself when I remember the correct word later.

**Taxis in Colombia**  
My record was a 50-minute conversation with an Uber driver to Medell√≠n‚Äôs international airport. I talked with the driver about the usual things - where I was from, why I loved the country and Spanish from Colombia etc - as well as what I do and that he wanted to improve his English. I told him to start with cartoons for very young children and to go from there.¬†

I believe I had to think of ways to work around 3 words I couldn't remember in the moment and I corrected my own conjugations a few times. He kindly corrected me 2 or 3 times in terms of the latter, too. I'm definitely getting better at knowing when I've made a mistake.

Not taking public transport from or to airports and 15 flights meant I spoke with a *lot* of Uber drivers. Most of the interactions went smoothly. I probably used Uber 12 times in Pereira alone because it's hilly and I was lazy. I think I took 40 to 50 Uber journeys in Colombia this time. I spoke to most of the drivers and only recall two challenging accents out of all of them. I was generally pleased with these interactions and they probably averaged around 15 minutes each.

# Compliments & improvements during this trip

I received zero compliments on my Spanish during my first trip to Colombia. I got plenty this time, though. It felt like I received compliments on a near-daily basis during the last two weeks of the trip. They were generally about the fluidity of my speaking or my correct use of present perfect conjugations.

I‚Äôm sure - just as during my last trip - that my Spanish benefited greatly from being in Colombia for 11 weeks. It‚Äôs not just hearing the language on a daily basis, either. My brain was slow to understand real-world usage of reflexives. It just clicked one day in late January and I‚Äôm confident that frequently seeing signs that used them radically sped up the process.

[One of my biggest improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1i5clx2/a_small_pronunciation_victory/) during the trip may seem small. However, the English vs Spanish pronunciation of I and E has been a big problem for a long time. The difference is subtle, but completely changes a person‚Äôs understanding, as in the example I cited. I know I still have a *lot* to learn when it comes to Spanish and that my pronunciation in general is far from perfect. However, being corrected a lot has helped.

I could feel my conjugations improve in the final 10 days or so of the trip. The specific constructions for the equivalent of things like ‚ÄúI have had too much caffeine today‚Äù just started to flow naturally.

Another positive thing I noticed is that far fewer people automatically realised that I was from the UK this time. This was especially apparent in the last ten days or so of the trip. I asked my teacher about my accent and she said that it‚Äôs improved since our initial lessons. For reference, I've been having lessons with her for around 6 months or so. I automatically started to produce a somewhat natural sounding Colombian single r sound soon after I changed my input to almost 100% Colombian Spanish at around 2,000 hours. I suppose I should have expected my accent to change after that and spending so much time in the country. I‚Äôm not at all displeased! This, to me, is another vindication of my choice to focus on Colombian Spanish.

As [per this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1ie1qju/bogot%C3%A1_the_compliments_i_waited_10_weeks_to_hear/), I was complimented by my hosts in the capital with whom I‚Äôd stayed before. I was waiting the whole trip for that.

# My biggest wins this trip

I could say that I was most pleased with my pronunciation of arepas. That single moment demonstrated that my efforts - and that of my teacher - had paid off. However, I think my confidence and comfort are at least as big of a deal.

Looking at my [post history](https://www.reddit.com/user/agentrandom/submitted/), you‚Äôll see that I was very confident this time. I could never, for instance, have confidently [corrected a sales assistant](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1ibq9jy/i_bought_a_phone_in_colombia_and_called_out_the/) on technical issues regarding a phone‚Äôs software updates last time. Additionally, all the Airbnb messages I sent before and during the last trip were in English. Everything I sent was in Spanish this time and 95% of it was written by me. I remember just about *kind of* managing to deal with a delivery guy last time. I dealt with neighbours and multiple delivery people with no issues at all this time. Including one who seemed to be trying to steal from my hosts. He essentially said that he left something at the property. I said I couldn‚Äôt give anyone anything without their permission. I was later told that was the right thing to do. It sounds simple, but I would have been lost and confused in that situation during the previous trip.

I didn‚Äôt simply go to restaurants (with written menus) and cafes this time, as was the case during the March trip. I interacted with more local people, spoke confidently and fluently with 40+ Uber drivers, ate and shopped at lots of small businesses and had longer conversations on a plethora of subjects with more Airbnb hosts in different cities than last time. To say that I‚Äôm pleased with this amount of progress after 6 months would be an understatement.

**I'm pleased**  
This may seem slow or insufficient progress to a lot of you after around 3,000 hours of listening. As I‚Äôve said in other posts, I have two types of autism and was diagnosed with learning difficulties as a child. In fact, my mother was once told by an expert to not expect me to ever speak. English. Given that, I‚Äôm very happy with my current level of speaking in Spanish.

**Goals for my next trip**  
I already have my main flights and some accommodation booked for mid-August to early November. I‚Äôm very confident I‚Äôll have reached 4,000 hours of input by the time the trip starts. I‚Äôve been told by my teacher that it should take me between 5 and 8 months to go from a B1 speaking level to a B2, with my current level of input etc. Thus, my goal is to be close to a B2 by the start of the next trip and to reach that B2 milestone while in Colombia. I‚Äôve no idea what else I‚Äôll achieve during the trip, but I fully expect the time there to be helpful.

I intend on visiting some of the main cities I‚Äôve not yet experienced, such as Cali. I‚Äôve booked accommodation with some of the same hosts, so I can repeat the same approach to benchmark/check my speaking progress. You‚Äôll hear all about my wins during the trip and there will be a detailed report like this when it ends.",1,1739335751.0,u_agentrandom,0,1.0,False

Connecting online is great, but I'm curious about the possibility of organizing a casual CF meetup in Pune.

But before I jump in and start planning, I really want to get your input and understand what *you* would hope for in a CF meetup here. Since this is a diverse community across India. I want to make sure we do it right and create something enjoyable and comfortable for everyone.

So, I'm reaching out to you all for your wisdom and suggestions! If you're interested in the idea of a childfree meetup in India (or even if you're just curious!), please share your thoughts on these questions:

1. Location (Consider Pune):

* For a  meetup in Pune, which area/neighborhood do you think would be most convenient and accessible? (e.g., Koregaon Park, Viman Nagar, FC Road, Kothrud, Aundh, etc.)"" *List popular areas in Pune.*
* Any venue type preferences in Pune? (e.g., Cafe with outdoor seating, relaxed pub/brewery, quiet restaurant, park picnic if weather is nice, etc.)""

2. Meetup Style & Activities (What kind of gathering would be most appealing?):

* What kind of meetup format would you be most interested in? (e.g., Casual coffee/tea meet, dinner/drinks, activity-based like a picnic, games, short hike if feasible, etc.)
* Daytime or evening meetup? Weekday or weekend?
* Would you prefer a very informal, unstructured gathering or something with a bit more planned activity or icebreakers (especially for a first meetup)?

3. Expectations & Atmosphere (What are you hoping to get out of it?):

* What would *you* personally hope to get out of a childfree meetup in India? (e.g., Just social connection, make new friends, find like-minded people for deeper conversations about CF life in India, vent/share experiences, maybe even explore dating possibilities within the community, etc.)
* What kind of atmosphere are you envisioning? (Relaxed, open, respectful, fun, supportive, inclusive?)
* Are you interested in one-off meetups or the potential for recurring meetups if the first one goes well?

4. Logistics & Organization (Practical considerations):

* What are the best platforms or methods for organizing and communicating about a meetup within our community? (Reddit DMs/chat groups, creating a separate group elsewhere, etc.)
* Any tips for gauging interest and managing RSVPs efficiently?
* Any general advice or tips for organizing a successful first meetup in India, especially for a relatively new community meeting offline?

5. Safety & Comfort (Important considerations in India):

* Are there any specific safety or comfort concerns you have about attending a meetup in India, especially as a first-timer or for women/minorities within the community? And how can we address these?
* Any ideas for ensuring a respectful, inclusive, and safe environment for everyone who attends?

6. Anything Else? (Open floor for your genius!):

* Are there any other aspects of a potential childfree meetup in India that I haven't considered but you think are important to discuss?
* Any general advice or encouragement for taking this leap and trying to bring our online community offline?
* Shoud a meetup be of singles or all inclusives?

Even if you only have thoughts on one or two points, please do share them! Your input is super valuable in shaping this idea and making a potential meetup truly beneficial and enjoyable for our r/childfreeindia community.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and making this happen! Thanks in advance for your suggestions! üòä",9,1739335623.0,ChildfreeIndia,3,0.92,False

I (24f) met this guy (30m) sometime in December. We just started hanging out maybe 2/3 weeks ago. On our first date, we went to a karaoke spot I like to go to, and he got drunk, and was acting just kind of more outgoing and goofy. Our second date, we both just stuck to beers and had really good conversation. Our third date, which was this past weekend, I got absolutely wasted. I told myself no shots and had a plan going in because we were going to his karaoke spot in his town where he knew everyone and I was already experiencing anxiety prior in the day about other things. I went way overboard, and from the parts I can remember, we had a good time. But then I ended up staying over his place because I was far too drunk to go back 30 minutes, and a snow storm had hit earlier than expected. I was planning on only having 2/3 beers and heading out before the snow came. But I let my anxiety get the better of me.

I remember kissing him at the karaoke spot while playing an arcade game, and then kissing him some more when we sat back down at our table, where I think everyone could see me just making out with him and I vaguely remember him joking saying, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll save this for later‚Äù or something along those lines‚Ä¶We had kissed on the first and second date already, so it wasn‚Äôt the first time we kissed. Anyway, when we went back to his place I also vaguely remember bits and pieces of talking a lot about insecurities and my previous relationship and just rambling from the foggy memory I do have, and told him I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was ready for another relationship so soon, but that I really liked him and wanted to see where things went. I don‚Äôt really remember what else I said, but I just have a feeling I overshared and embarrassed myself to the extreme. I think I said something like he was a good guy and I didn‚Äôt want to waste his time. I also don‚Äôt know how much I trauma dumped on him, or really what I said at all for the majority of it. I have no idea what I shared with him. 

Anyway, we woke up and we still cuddled in the morning. And talked a bit. I told him I wish I hadn‚Äôt had so much to drink and was pretty anxious about it, but he said I was great and he had a good time. He made me a coffee and kissed me goodbye, and when I texted him when I was home, he said he had a great night with me. 

I really like him and do want to see where things go and I guess I‚Äôm just thinking to ask him more in depth about what I said, or really exactly what I said to ease my anxiety, or just leave it and move on. I feel as though this is going to affect how I act with him going forward, not knowing really what I said, and just feel on edge now, where the previous dates, and before I got way too intoxicated on this one, I felt okay, and I was making jokes, just being myself. Now that he knows things that I don‚Äôt even remember telling him about myself potentially, I don‚Äôt know how to act. I do know that going forward, I will not allow myself to get this way again, because it has made my anxiety spike worse than it was before. ",2,1739335360.0,relationship_advice,5,0.75,False

What would he have to do/say for things to be okay this time? How could I possibly trust that he‚Äôs changed?

1.  He would have to tell me about sorry he is for the hurt and betrayal. Listing the things that were the most hurtful and impactful for me and acknowledging things he denied before.

2. He would tell me specifically what he has learned from being a part, as well as how he has failed in past relationships.

3. He would tell me the things he is doing and has done to improve, which would include: Trauma therapy, remaining single and being in recovery actively with a program/support system. 

4. He would tell me all the ways he will show up for me and how he is committed to being the best partner he can be.

1initdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinterHomebrew/comments/1initdb/brew_report_dark_matter/,Brew Report: Dark Matter,"Thought I'd add some data points to the Pinter hivemind database. Yes, I know the pic is atrocious but a) my phone sucks in low light and b) it's a stout - it's dark, it's got a bit of head, what more do you need to see?

I'll cover as many things as occur to me that seem to be **variables** based on what I've read here and elsewhere. But first: overall impressions. It's really not bad! (I don't mean to damn with faint praise. Honest.) It's very hop-forward for a stout and a little acrid, with poor mouthfeel and little stout texture. It's at least a broad-jump in the direction of a brown ale, but with more richness and malty flavor. Some astringency. 

The last Pinter I put together was a House Pale (I believe it's called?) and my first thought on pull was ""Well, I wouldn't tolerate this in a commercial beer, but for something from my kitchen it isn't half bad."" This Dark Matter is honestly better than that; I've paid money for worse (not just weirder; worse) draft stouts. I've *definitely* paid money for worse draft brown ales, and this beer is at almost a halfway point between the two styles. So far I think that Pinter kits, of any variety, are an exercise in filling the area under a curve of maltiness, hop flavor, and texture that may get you 80-90% of your favorite oatmeal, coffee (for this kit), or extra stout but are simply never going to approach the pull they give you a little paper certificate for at the Gravity Bar atop St. James' Gate. And that's... that's cool, man. That's cool.

*  **Water**. It didn't occur to me to do otherwise until I was already in the midst of things, so I used **plain tap water** for this batch. I know, I know. Nothing went south and municipal tap water for me is pretty high-quality, but I've since switched to bottled spring water at room temperature to eliminate this variable. When I mixed this batch the tap water was around **60F** (yes, I measured it, that's the least I could do after screwing myself into not using bottled water), and I did not pre-soak or -warm the yeast (Pinter's included ""**Loyalty**"" **yeast**) to ""wake it up"" or similar. Just threw that shit in there.
* **Mixing**. I have a hard time refering to using a Pinter as ""brewing"" without a boil and using pre-hopped malt extract; the broke-ass 90s Mr Beer kid in me cries out for justice in nomenclature. Anyway, I note in other folks' result reports a lot of ennui about inadequate mixture of the Pinter extracts, addressed by pre-mixing smaller quantities in water jugs, inserting electric blenders to ensure adequate dilution of extract, etc. I forego all of that in favor of filling the Pinter (to the line between white interior liner and black neck liner; I have repeatedly read and heard ""internal fill line"" but I did not pay any attention to Pinter's videos or app so I don't know if they define this anywhere) and **shaking the moderate shit out of it**, but more important IMO just thereafter **repeatedly inverting the Pinter with brewing dock attached**. As is aurally evident when doing this and therefore making me a PhD-level expert in fluid dynamics, the spring-loaded connection between these two vessels is a turbulence-inducing bottleneck and I have deep faith that just flipping the thing 10-20 times agitates the contents adequately to ensure somewhat uniform distribution in the water of malt and yeast. So far, so good.
* **Ferment**. I mixed this sucker up on 25 Jan 2025 and fermented for **10 days**. I don't even know what the Pinter times are but they all seem to me criminally short so I ignore them. (I just checked Pinter's site and ""recommended"" is 5 days. Lol) I ferment in my laundry room (don't @ me), which ranges between **69F** (nice) and **72F**. Specifically **atop my washing machine**, conveniently out of reach of the dog and kids. I was initially amused by fancying that periodic low-level agitation (we average an hour or two of washing cycle per day) might help with flocculation and perhaps intra-ferment mixing, but I'm actually taking that seriously now since the couple of translucent brews I've done so far have been *remarkably* clear, without cold crashing as my fridge space isn't adequate for that. I may move the next batch to some place none of the pets or kids can get to, if I can find one, and have a non-agitated control batch. But so far the washing-machine ferments have been very nicely free of trub, both on tapping (almost no sediment) and cleanup (minimal residual sediment). They've also (see overall impressions) been pretty damn good-tasting for a halfass homebrew, with not much of the fruity/musty notes that seem a little inescapable with these premix brews, and I wonder whether agitation-assisted flocculation and, therefore, effective yeast removal on brewing-dock separation may play a role there. For those who want to explore this exciting world of Flocculation Assisted by Periodic Restrained Shaking (FAPRS), LG will gladly sell you a frustratingly finicky front-loading washer for around $499 plus tax. Labor and gas/electricity to run it a couple times a day, extra.
* **Condition**. After a satisfyingly yeasty and messy dock separation, I slapped the Pinter into the fridge and it sat there for **7 days** until today (11 Feb 2025), at a steady **36F** (another awful LG product that builds up ice in all the wrong places, but at least it has a digital thermostat). That's the same as Pinter's recommended condition, and I have a personal deeply-held belief that conditioning time is far less important than fermentation to the beer's flavor, so long as it sits cold enough, long enough, to avoid exploding into foam geysers on tapping. Goal achieved in that regard.

And that's largely it! I don't know for how long this or any other Pinter brew might keep after tapping, because a couple of friends and I don't intend that it last long enough to find out. Based on their behavior (not mine), Pinter's projected ABV of 5% is not off the mark. Cheers ",2,1739334674.0,PinterHomebrew,1,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1inisgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1inisgo/f21_m26_situationship_litterally_down_the_drain/,"F21 M26, Situationship litterally down the drain, can you guys help me figure out what went down?","So, I met this guy on a summer vacation. I had broken up with a long-term boyfriend (about half a decade long) in March, three months before I had even gone on this trip. I came into the vacation wanting to be only single and have a bunch of casual hookups. 

Nonetheless, this man just appeared; we came in on the same flight, and our friend groups happened to start talking to each other on the first night. There was something about him I could not resist; he was everything I had ever wanted, and to be honest, he was the total opposite of my type. Dark hair, dark doe eyes, and there was something about him I wanted. He didn't talk to me or wasn't necessarily lusting around (which, lowkey, I now know why), and so I was the one who even initiated the conversation. I looked at him, and I felt like there was a story that was going to unfold between him and me. I have no idea why; I still don't know why. I started talking to him, and it's wild because it turns out we lived a block away from each other for the last three years. We had briefly lived near each other, too, in our childhoods. 

Anyway, a few days later, I found out he had a girlfriend, and I was devastated and stopped talking to him. On the second last day, I needed someone to accompany me to the beach because none of my friends wanted to mess with the Mexican dealers, so  I asked him to accompany me. He was so cool, I told him to act gay to get free stuff, and he did, and I swear that was so fun and ballsy of us. At some point, he explained that they were on and off and had gotten into a relationship-ending fight (or something else I don't remember) before this trip. I remember this: He said, ""If I were to get with anyone on this trip, I should not bother talking to her again."" Im not stupid; god knows what happened, and I am a bit embarrassed to say I didn't think that deeply about it. I am freshly out of a relationship and was okay with being friends with benefits. His actions were strange, but they did align with the fact that his relationship was ending. What he told me sounded similar to what happened between my ex and me, so I put my mindset on him. Something in my gut felt like meeting him was destined, and I had to see the end of this story.

Fast forward to us in our hometown. I contacted him a few days later, asking to grab a coffee. I miss this era; it was so beautiful between him and me; we were getting to know each other, and we were fun, young, sexual and free. We had started to meet up sometimes on our night outs, and I introduced him to my best friend and vice versa. On the sidelines, it was growing more and more evident there was something odd happening on his end. This whole girlfriend thing was so weird from the start. There was a night when we were all out, and he was on the phone with this girl while I was there. It was so pathetic, and I always ask myself why I didn't see the signs this early. Why did I keep going with this? I did see the signs; I just ignored them. Also, I wasn't a peach; I had fucked another ex right before the vacation and tbh, I never entirely stopped talking to other people throughout our time together, but would you? 

I found out who it was super fast. He left her, and I never asked him to do that. He told me he would end things, and it seems he did. You might all be like, yeah, I don't believe it, and honestly, I still don't believe it, but lowkey, that girl got a new man that looks just like him so fast and still posts him on her vsco even after me and him ended. I bet she also got so tired of him, and she gave him like 4 years. I never wanted to enter this triangle; I didn't get the whole picture until a month or two into us being in this odd limbo. I still don't have the entire picture. The only reason he even told me this, though, was that he had a full-ass seizure with me at his home from the anxiety, or at least associated his guilt with the seizure, and he started talking. 

I saw the potential in our relationship when I met him on this trip; I went up to him on the last day and had a sit-down conversation, and told him im not looking for a relationship but that ""you are fun, and im looking for someone genuine to get to know and do stuff with. We live close to each other, and I would like to see you back home."" He didn't actively really react positively or negatively, and I was so drunk all day on that trip I also don't remember, but that's what happened. I am a female, and it was a bit against my nature, but I couldn't see myself dating, much less with someone who potentially had a girlfriend at the time (lol). But to be honest, I enjoyed our arrangement. 

The dynamic started to take a turn; I couldn't help but feel like he was unhappy with our relationship. It never made sense to me because, from the start, this man gave commitment issues, i.e., his gf, how he described the relationship, etc. Eventually, we had this conversation, and he asked us to be exclusive. I don't think he realized this was a hard ask for me. I turned to him and said well, if you don't want me getting with anybody else, then you also can't get with anybody else, and he, for some reason, exaggerated, said aw man, now I can't get with people. It was in such a weird tone, and not in a push back im angry way, but in a I have to say this because im nonchalant. I don't react, and he isn't even pushing back on my request; I still don't know what vibe he was trying to give off. He repeated himself cartoonishly, and from then on, we were exclusive.

It felt like the label only existed between us, and these words had no meaning. I forgot to mention that we had both played never have I ever on vacation, and both had admitted to cheating on our previous partners (Yikes). I felt relaxed knowing we shared similar pasts; it made him human but also myself human, and there was some room for mistakes. He gives the epitome fuck boy, or at least he tried to give that impression. Deep down, he's more loyal and caring than he wants to believe and not so nonchalant, but maybe that's what I wanted to believe. Anyways, he lacks emotional vulnerability, like in the way where he can't show they care for someone, and he is insecure about himself. The insecurity ruins him because he's the super cool, intelligent guy that everyone around him envies. He's the hottest of his friend group, and it's obvious he has a lot of influence. It's so obvious. However, this feeling of inadequacy and uncoolness makes him mistreat everyone around him; he consistently says backhanded comments and compliments, constantly compares himself to others, and makes selfish decisions. 

We have reached this peak, and things have started to turn nasty. I had no idea what was going on in his brain. It started to feel weird. The first thing I began to notice were these manipulative moments between him and me. One moment I remember we were talking about porn, and he asked me on two occasions if I watched it; I answered yes both times. The second time, however, he was like, oh my god, me too. Can I show you this photo? I look, and I swear to god this man went to an AI and asked for the complete opposite of me, a big-boobed, blonde, blue-eyed, white woman and im some tiny brown-eyed Latina; I am blonde tho. At that moment, I was like, did you plan this? I didn't say that; I paid no mind and moved on. Im hot and confident, so maybe he was trying to humble me, but as if. 

Anyways, more odd things like this would happen; he showed me some girl with a nice ass and said I could achieve this ass if I went to the gym, okay, buddy. He also kept trying to say I love you drunk. I would have said it back like a normal person If he treated me like a normal person, but eventually, I told him to say this to me sober. He sends me an I heart you, not even typing it out but rather a heart emoji some days later. I was getting super annoyed, and by this point, I started to talk to him less, and I didn't ask him to make plans. (I had been the only one making plans throughout this.) Well, a week went by, and he was drunk and crashing out on me, asking why I was texting less, why I hadn't seen him in like a week. He ended it with me earlier that night because I was at a friend's, and he brought up a serious conversation regarding my distance. I told him we could talk about it later. We ended up on a phone call where he said all this to me.

On top of that, he kept asking me what we are, this and that, and to say what we are in three words: I'm like, I can't believe this right now. He had been subtly bringing up things related to what we are, or like, probing the commitment for a while. I evaded his comments about commitment because I always thought he was bluffing. The following day, he would pretend nothing happened, but I called everything out. What makes me sad is that I started being okay with having this relationship conversation that he seemed like he wanted to have after this crash out. So I went to his house, and no one had ever made such a fool of me. 

He begins by saying he doesn't remember anything, so I tell him everything. I finally bring up the what are we convo, and the man goes back to being nonchalant, but his face is saying something else. I have no idea how to describe it. He's telling me, let's go with the flow, this and that, and it was a bit soul-crushing. His face was odd; it was like I was showing that I was willing to date him, and that relaxed him, and he seemed happy and sickly enjoying his cruel go-with-the-flow moment. He then fucking asked to go to the gym together in an I need to do this, and I don't want to inconvenience myself despite this convo way; I should have gone home; I don't know why I didn't. What happened at the gym made me so sad; I saw it in his eyes; that day, he lost respect for me; he saw me as annoying, unserious, and less of a person. I spent the night and left super early in the morning. After the gym, I had a great time with him, but he felt like a dirty soul. I felt so small, and I left him shortly afterward. I knew something was seriously wrong with how I was being treated.

We didn't talk for about a month, but he reached out several times. He apologized, even though his apologies never meant anything due to something he said very early on. Eventually, he got the memo and took me out on a date. This date was me claiming respect back into our relationship. If you don't treat me like your equal, I won't stay around. Everything was going great, and he was letting his guard down as a person. He's so lovely when he isn't being mean or disrespectful. We are similar, and I enjoy spending time with him when he is respectful. I could tell he was going through a lot, and I didn't know how to be there. I just gave up, though; our interactions started to hurt me. The more I looked back, the more I couldn't think about anything he did for me or show that he ever liked me. Near the actual end, I realized that he genuinely never asked to make plans and would text me about his stuff and give me crappy late replies to mine. I felt like he didn't even know me by the end of these 6 months, and I felt rejected whenever I tried to show it. For a long time, I thought he appreciated having hugs with me on Fortnite, and this sold it for me; one of the last times I ever spoke to him, he told me he always used the emote as an expression of ""What?"". It hurt to realize how little I had meant to him; sometimes, I think it's not true. He must have appreciated me at some point, but he just used me and took me for granted. 

I struggled to express all of these things that bothered me, and I understand why it's hard to trust each other. I don't know his side of all this. Instead of adequately saying this, I would often retreat, pull back, and try to avoid conflict. You could describe me as too nice, and I don't say when things bother me; those are his words. When I emotionally gave up, I was still talking to him, and he was saying and doing the things I would have appreciated beforehand. It was tough. I really liked him, and I wanted to grow with him. I used to see us spending a lot of time together. I'm not sure how long it has been, two months or so, without speaking a word, and I want to face the reality of this situation. So, if anyone has taken the time to read all of this, please tell me what you think happened and how I can avoid this in the future. ",0,1739334590.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

So I recently finished the first book in this series, *The Calculating Stars*, and am fixing to begin the second book: *The Fated Sky*. Both of these books (and two further ones, including one that is fixing to be published next month), and a couple of short stories are all part of her 'punch card punk' universe called The Lady Astronaut.

For those who aren't familiar with this author or her work, Kowal is a speculative fiction author who is also a professional puppeteer (she's done work for Jim Henson Productions and was a regular worker on *LazyTown*) and a professional voice actor who does audio books. On top of this, she's also written a Regency fantasy series called the *Congress*, as well as some other books. A common aspect of her work is mixing big concepts with slice-of-life drama.

As for this particular series: it's essentially an alternate history of the space program. Although there were already some minor changes to the timeline before the book starts (no spoilers), the primary change happens in March of 1952, when a meteorite strikes the Eastern Seaboard. This results in the complete obliteration of Washington DC (including the President, Vice President, Speaker of the House, all of Congress and the Joint Chiefs of Staff) and leaving a boiling crater in its wake, while also causing leveling a lot of East Coast through the resulting tsunamis, earthquakes, etc. The heroine of this first book, Elma York, was enjoying a holiday with her husband Nathaniel (and engineer) in the Poconos when the meteor hits, managing to just barely survive. Elma is a former WASP from the second World War (as well as a skilled mathematician), so she's able to locate a plane and make their way to Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio where they learn the full scale of the disaster.

But it's only later, when York and her husband sit down and do the math, that they realize the real disaster looming: because of the extensive amount of water vapor that the meteorite tossed up into the air, the greenhouse effect is now in motion, and that in a few decades the planet will be uninhabitable for human life. The solution? A global aerospace coalition that will kickstart humanity's colonization of space.

What do I love about this book? Well, it has all the big alternate history conceits that I love, but it also is loaded with a lot of slice-of-life things: dinner parties, office conversations, coffee talk, you get the idea. But it's also has a lot to say: remember, this book still takes place in the 1950s and all that comes with it. Racism is very much a thing obviously, but sexism is also a major issue as York (who, I remind you, was a WASP with several hours of logged flight in her record) is trying to make a place for women on the space program...but she isn't taken very seriously, and sadly like a lot of RL women her role is restricted to the very important (but not very glamorous) role as a professional computer. Yet she makes a lot of friends and allies in that computing office, and eventually she figures out a way to prove her worth...

Seriously, though: this book really had me hooked from the first chapter and made me hunger for more. Kowal's decision to begin every chapter with bits and pieces of in-universe newspaper clippings is a great way to grow the universe while still telling such a personal story.",4,1739334463.0,LeftieSpecFic,1,1.0,False

I received the new OEM replacement from Germany for ~$100 USD and this capacitor is also not registering on my multimeter. The Fluke 107 is speced to max 1000uF to 1uF resolution. 

I assume I'm doing something wrong here. Am I measuring incorrectly? Original capacitor was ~20 years old.

We currently own a 3yo CC and our breeder left the ears/tail up to us which I appreciated. We chose to leave everything intact, purely cosmetic surgeries are just not it in our family. He lives indoors with us as a family pet with minimal protection training so the safety aspect of having his tail/ears torn off as working dog are just not likely to happen. 

As we are looking ahead to getting another in the next few years though I am considering docking our next ones tail. Why you ask? The bruises left on our legs from the wagging, the eye injuries my kids have had from being at eye level with the tail (they have learned to catch his tail in their hands over time here) the countless shattered things he has wagged off the coffee table, and the injury/bleeding that happens when he wags it too hard onto a corner in a doorway (happy tail syndrome I believe people call it). We will also be planning to add another one in as a livestock guardian dog as well as a pet, so much more along the working lines. 

So talk me into it or out of it. I want to hear your thoughts. My heart aches at the thought of inflicting pain and altering a future dogs body, are the ‚Äúpros‚Äù in my mind just selfish and I should accept these things as part of owning a giant breed dog? Or are these a fair justification for our quality of life while having these beautiful creatures a part of it? I will not judge people for making choices differently than mine, in either direction.

The primary side is supplied with power that generates an electromagnetic field, this is captured by the core and ""transmitted"" (for lack of a better term) over to the secondary windings.

Now if I hook up some devices like lamps, lights, coffee machine, etc I will complete some circuits and draw power from that secondary winding.

I can continue to draw until I've maxed out the amount of amps that electromagnetic field can provide into the secondary.

I recently just bought a new Acaia Pearl for my pourover setup. I've been using a Lunar for many years (pre-2021 model) for my espresso, and it's just too small for my pourover setup. 

  
After receiving my Pearl, I noticed that the reading from the Pearl didn't agree with that on my Lunar. The niche zero dosing cup that I've been using since 2020 reads 109.2 on the Lunar, and 109.5 on the Pearl. After some experiments, the difference is roughly 0.3 g per 100g. This difference persists after I calibrated both scales with the 100g weight that came with the Lunar. 

  
Is this normal? Has anyone noticed similar effects? This probably wouldn't matter in terms of the end coffee I'm making, but it just got me thinking.

Does everyone still have some amount of sugar whilst fasting or are we completely giving up sugar as well. (Obviously better to give up sugar)
