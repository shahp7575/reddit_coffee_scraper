# The Man Behind the Desk

Most of us think of luxury hotels as glamorous getaways filled with champagne, infinity pools, and silk bathrobes. But behind the scenes, there’s a whole other world—one where high-paying guests make the most absurd, outlandish, and sometimes downright insane demands.

Meet Mathieu. For ten years, he was a top-tier concierge at some of the world’s most exclusive hotels. His job? Making the impossible possible. He was the go-to guy for celebrities, billionaires, and world leaders, ensuring their every whim was met—no matter how bizarre it was.

From acquiring a paon albinos (yep, an [albino peacock](https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=imgurl%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.birdadvisors.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F01%2Fwhite-peacock-3.jpg&s=30&view=detailv2&iss=sbi&idpp=imgqna&vt=1&idpview=singleimage&idpbck=1&utm_source=www.neuralbites.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-wildest-concierge-stories-from-rihanna-s-requests-to-escort-vans-at-luxury-hotels)) to booking a last-minute flight for a six-figure contract lost in a mailroom, Mathieu’s career was anything but boring. Let’s dive into his craziest experiences.

# When Rihanna Needs a Sextoy…

You think you know what it’s like catering to celebrities? Think again.

One day, Mathieu’s phone rang. It was Rihanna’s assistant, calling from her hotel suite. She stammered, struggling to explain the request. After a few awkward moments, Rihanna herself took the phone. “I need this,” she said, showing a model of a certain adult toy on her phone screen. No hesitation, no shame—just another day in the life of a global superstar.

Mathieu, ever the professional, got it sorted. No questions asked.

“She didn’t even open the box before leaving,” he recalls. “That’s what blew my mind the most.”

# Escort Vans and Secret Codes: The Hidden World of Hotel Prostitution

Ever wonder what goes on behind closed doors in five-star hotels? Spoiler alert: a lot.

According to Mathieu, escort services operate like well-oiled machines in these high-end establishments. They don’t come knocking on doors anymore. Instead, they blend in—dressed in designer outfits, sipping martinis at the hotel bar, waiting to be “discovered.”

But sometimes, things get more explicit. Mathieu remembers the night when a blacked-out van pulled up in front of the hotel. Out poured six women, all dolled up. “For one client,” Mathieu says. “One guy had booked all of them for the night.”

And no, this wasn’t a rare occurrence. “It happened more often than you’d think.”

# Biggest Tips and Crazy Spending

Being a concierge isn’t a high-paying gig—at least not in terms of base salary. But when the right clients roll in, the tips can be life-changing.

Mathieu once received **€3,000** in cash just for picking up a rare camera from another city. His biggest haul? **Between €8,000 and €10,000** in a single month—completely off the books.

But while Mathieu was raking in cash, the clients were throwing it away at an even faster rate. He’s seen guests drop **€100,000** a night for a luxury suite and witnessed a Saudi princess rack up an **€8 million** debt in a matter of days—only for her family to wire the money without blinking.

“They spent like regular people buy coffee,” he says.

# How to (Politely) Say No to Illegal Requests

If you think concierges only deal with spa reservations and dinner bookings, think again. They get **asked for drugs, guns, and even fake IDs**—and they have to decline in the smoothest way possible.

Saying “no” isn’t an option. Instead, concierges have their own coded ways of refusing illegal requests. When a wealthy American guest asked for a firearm, Mathieu had to navigate the conversation carefully.

“I told him, ‘Unfortunately, that won’t be possible, sir.’ It was all about the tone—you can’t make it sound like you’re rejecting them outright.”

For drugs? Clients were simply given a **phone number**. “Call this guy,” Mathieu would say, before walking away. “That way, it’s out of my hands.”

# Rockstars, Wrecked Suites, and Total Chaos

You’ve seen the stories of rockstars trashing hotel rooms—but Mathieu has seen it firsthand.

“You put ten people in a suite with unlimited booze and drugs, and within hours, it looks like a war zone,” he says. Beds broken, TVs smashed, food smeared on the walls, and… let’s just say, **bodily fluids everywhere.**

And yes, the hotels charge them for damages. But for these guests, it’s just another line on their credit card statement.

# The Most Insane Requests: From Albino Peacocks to Fighter Jets

Some people want a fancy dinner. Others? **They want a rare, exotic bird delivered to their suite.**

One client requested an albino peacock—because, why not? Mathieu and his team had to call exotic animal suppliers to track one down. “In the end, the guest just wanted it to walk around the room,” he laughs.

Then there were the **fighter jets.** A wealthy businessman rented out a castle for a party and asked if fighter jets could fly over at a specific time with colored smoke trails. “We made it happen,” Mathieu says. “Not the actual French Air Force, but close enough.”

# Burnout, Insanity, and Walking Away

For all its wild perks, the job took its toll. The 24/7 availability, constant stress, and dealing with impossible people led Mathieu to **severe burnout.**

“You’re never off the clock,” he says. “I once got a call at 3 AM, asking me to catch a train to London in two hours to pick up a handbag.”

In the end, it wasn’t worth it. Mathieu left the hotel industry and returned to his first love—**acting and photography.**

# The Bottom Line: The Hotel Industry is a Different Universe

If you ever thought working in a five-star hotel was glamorous, think again. It’s **part spy game, part problem-solving, part circus.** You’re dealing with the world’s richest, most powerful, and most demanding individuals.

Mathieu has seen it all—celebrities, royalty, criminals, and tech moguls, all living in a world detached from reality. “For them, money doesn’t exist. There’s no limit to what they can ask for.”

So next time you’re at a luxury hotel and see a well-dressed concierge standing at the desk, just know—he’s probably heard, seen, and handled things you wouldn’t believe.

If you’re as obsessed with AI as I am, you’re going to love what’s on the horizon! Today, I’m diving into the buzzing world of Generative AI trends we anticipate seeing in 2025/2026. Get comfy, grab your favorite snack, and let's explore the future! 🚀

---

### 🌐 Societal Shifts & AI: The Bigger Picture

We're beginning to see how generative AI isn't just a technical advancement—it's a cultural beacon. As AI-generated content becomes mainstream, the artistic landscape leans into collaborative creations between humans and machines. Picture an AI helping to draft a blockbuster movie or the next viral TikTok trend! Not only does this shift redefine content creation, but it also challenges societal views on creativity and authenticity. 

### 🧠 AI Stepping Up the Creativity Game

Generative AI is about to become a lot more… well, generative! Instead of just texts and images, think beyond—music, complex data visualizations, even AI-generated flavors? 🤯 Technologies like GPT-4.5 and DALL-E 3 are setting the stage for tools that blend different media, making multifaceted creation accessible to everyone. The ""everyone's an artist"" world might be just around the corner!

### 🤖 Smarter, More Contextual AI Models

Forget generic, one-size-fits-all AI responses. Future models will have enhanced contextual understanding, meaning AI that *gets you*. Imagine a virtual assistant that knows your morning routine better than your coffee maker does. We’re talking personalized ads feeling less creepy and more like that really helpful friend who actually listens.

### 💡 From Theory to Impact: AI in Climate Action

On the serious side, AI is set to become a hero in tackling climate change. From precision agriculture improving crop yields to energy-efficient smart grids, generative AI is tuned to optimize resources and reduce our carbon footprint. Who knew bits and bytes could be green warriors?

### 🛡️ Ethics & Accountability in AI Systems

As AI evolves, so must our conversation around ethics. 2025/2026 will pioneer advanced frameworks for accountability. Think AI systems capable of explaining their decisions, making them more transparent and trustworthy partners in whatever task they undertake. These developments will pave the way for AI systems that are not just cold executors but supportive companions.

Not anaphylactic as such but throat gets scratchy and if exposed my hands stiffen up and appear in welts. I have been at my workplace for over 2 years and they are aware. Yesterday when I went to get a coffee someone was eating prawns in the lunch room. The smell alone won’t cause a reaction as such but I have fibromyalgia and my instant reaction to the smell is to go into fight or flight and I feel nauseous and almost always ends in a migraine. I voiced my concerns to HR and when they returned they advised the response from said person was “well she is not in here at the moment”. Before I left yesterday (3 hrs after incident) I cleaned up my 2 cups in kitchen to ensure no contamination. As I was riding home I had tingling in my hand and when I got home my hand was red, stiff and itchy. I wasn’t going to say anything but thought no I need to why should I be the one in discomfort. After sending a photo of my hand and saying it was only a minor reaction but still a reaction I was asked if I carry a EPI pen and that I need to submit evidence of my allergy. I am in financial hardship at the moment and dealing with other health issues so can’t afford to go. AIO why can’t this person just eat seafood at home and not work. Why do I have to jump through all the hoops to prove an allergy I have had all my life? Rant over :(

1ja325k,https://www.reddit.com/r/luxefamilytravels/comments/1ja325k/trip_report_thailand_malaysia_and_singapore_with/,"[Trip Report] Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore with 2 kids","Decided to post my trip report for my recent trip because it seemed to help a lot of people when I did the same thing for my trip report for Japan and Korea last year. Please post or dm if you have any questions!

My family and I took a two week trip to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore in early February. This is our 4th major trip with the kids (5 year old daughter and 4 year old son) and I feel they are pretty good travellers now. They don't really have major issues with long haul flights and bounce back from jetlag pretty quickly.

Day 1

-Flew out of YYZ on February 8th. Landed in Vancouver and then landed in BKK on February 10.

-checked in to Mercure 11 Sukhumvit. Not a bad hotel, clean and got us checked in at 12PM. Would not recommend if you're conservative or your kids are sensitive to noise. Fairly close to Nana Plaza, but there is also a wealth of restaurants in the area.

-once we cleaned up and rested, we headed out for some light exploring. We decided to check out Wat Pho. The weather was spectacular and we got there about 40 minutes before Sunset. We spent some time walking around the grounds, and the kids loved the cats roaming around. Once we finished up we went to Wat Pho pier. Great views and spots to take pictures of Wat Arun lit up at night. We took a tuktuk to Jodd Fair night market, got some food and headed back to the hotel. For dinner, we went to restaurant called Marigo near our hotel. One thing I learned is to always ask them to spice it up to Thai levels.

Day 2

-the next morning we woke up and went to Coffee Club near our hotel. I had heard about this Australian chain quite a bit so I was excited to try it. Overall, It was pretty expensive and the coffee was good, not great.

-got a taxi to Wat Arun. When I say it was brutal in terms of heat this day, it was an extreme understatement. We spent around 45 minutes at the grounds, the kids got blessed by a monk at one of the temples. We then took a water taxi to Icon Siam and spent 2-3 hours checking out the shopping and the foutain at the top, which was pretty cool. On the ground floor of Icon Siam is an enormous food stall market called Icon Takasamiya. There are hundreds of food stalls, and we found one that specialized in Khao Soi. The flavor was absolutely incredible and I ended up having a second serving.

-went back to the hotel, the kids went to the pool got a bit and then we all took a nap. When we woke up, the wife wanted to go out to a nice restaurant - we ended up going to Sri Tripat. It was some parts fine dining, other parts ""homely"". I ordered the crab fried rice, giant prawn, noodles and a few other things. $2900 THB, but was an interesting experience and excellent food.

Day 3

-my wife saw numerous tiktoks on the floating market and railroad market so we got a half-day tour from BCX, a tour provider in Bangkok. They picked us up at 8:00am from our hotel and we then proceed to another hotel where other members of the tour joined in. We then went on the train for around 45 minutes to the Maeklong railway market, where vendors are inches away from the train. We spent around 45 minutes at this market, checked out the local temple and got a couple of souvenirs from the vendors. The tour (mini) bus collected us took us to the floating market. We got to go around in a boat and floating vendors gave us an opportunity to buy things from them. Although unique, I believe the floating market can be skipped, especially because the drive back to Bangkok is around 1:45 hours and your really just being sold over priced wares and snacks. The food at the floating market isn't great either imo.

-because of how intense the day was, my kids were in no mood to head out and we ended up grabbing KFC and just having a family night at the hotel. We later went out for ice cream. Do not skip out on the KFC chicken wings, they are amazing (Zebb flavor).

Day 4

-Our flight to Chiang Mai was at 11 and were were flying out from DMK, which is the smaller of the two airports in Bangkok.

-I was actually pretty impressed with how much stuff was at this tiny airport. The kids got some happy meals, and my wife and I got some snacks from 7/11 and a couple of Krispy Kreme donuts.

-flight was just over an hour on Thai Lion Air. I've flown many discount airlines around the world, but I have never had such little legroom. My knees were jammed into the front seat. Genuinely an uncomfortable experience, though the staff was friendly.

-we checked into to our hotel at The Chiang Mai Old Town. Gorgeous little boutique hotel right in the edge of the old town with very friendly staff.

-overall very impressed with this hotel and the style and details were really appreciated.

-after cleaning up, we decided to head over to Khao Soi Neimman. Total whole in the wall place on the Michelin guide. Heavily recommended by multiple reviewers and vloggers. Definitely great and the pricing was appreciated. Unfortunately, while we were eating, a couple of mice began to run around on the outdoor patio creating a bit of a panic amongst the patrons and souring the experience some what. Would recommend, but stay inside.

We headed back to the hotel and the kids jumped in the pool for a bit. Once we got ready to head out, both kids got sleepy and we went back to our room.

Day 5

-We started day by sleeping in and enjoying some breakfast at the hotel.

-headed out for some temple hopping and walking down the main street in the Old City. We visited around 3 of them and then ended at Wat Chiang Mai, which to me is worth the visit for as a non-Buddhist.

-on the way back to the hotel, we tried another highly acclaimed restaurant called Khao Soi Kun Yai. This place was basically an outdoor kitchen staffed by some really cute old ladies and some plastic chairs under a tarp. I was blown away by the flavor of the Khao Soi and how rich the broth was. A must visit when you're in Chiang Mai.

-we went back to the hotel to rest for a bit and then head out to the Night Bazaar. We went over to the food stalls and got some pad thai and banana roti for the kids. There was some live music and over all a really chill vibe to just enjoy the night.

-ended up buying a couple of things I needed...if you're interested in something, more than one vendor will be selling whatever you're interested in and will be willing to give you whatever price you want, so don't settle unless you don't really care about pricing.

Day 6

-started off the day early because we had a tour booked for an elephant sanctuary and the sticky waterfalls.

-we headed out to the elephant sanctuary first called Hug Chang Elephant Sanctuary. We specifically chose this sanctuary because there was no elephant riding offered and from what I could tell before booking it was actually an ethical sanctuary.

-The whole vibe of the sanctuary is very much like a rural village...roosters walking around everywhere, dogs scampering about, cats hanging out and the elephants doing their own thing.

-After you arrive, you're given a basic lesson on Elephants and then you spend about 30 minutes chopping up sugarcane and making banana and tamarind treats for the elephants.

-once the treats are completed you head over to the Elephants and feed them. Afterwards, you're taken across a river where you feed a couple of other elephants. These elephants are walking around completely free. It's a wild feeling being right next to something that huge and powerful. The Elephants then lay down in the river and you wash them with a softened coconut shell.

-after hanging out with the Elephants for about an hour or so, you're given lunch.

-After the elephant sanctuary, my particular tour guide headed out to the Sticky Waterfalls. It takes about an hour and you're traveling on some absolutely gorgeous roads. If anyone wants somewhere interested to take their motorcycle, this is it.

-upon reaching the Sticky Waterfalls, you enter a park with a really cool fishpond to the left.

-At the Sticky Waterfalls, you'll need to climb down some wood stairs barefoot (or with something like multi strap sandals. Climbing the Sticky Waterfalls is a surreal experience because you're feet have so much grip it messes with your brain somewhat. I would urge some cautious because there are green algae spots where it can slippery. The water at the time I was there (Feb 15) was such a perfect temperature, it was heavenly sitting in a free spot and just enjoying the water rushing by you. If you have joint or knee issues I wouldn't recommend this activity. My kids made it up with some help and felt like super heroes.

-we got back to our hotel in about an hour and rested for a bit. For dinner, we decided to try The House by Ginger. This is a fairly upscale restaurant (for Chiang Mai) set in an old colonial house. The food was 8/10, and the pricing was very high for Chiang Mai standards. Loved their house cocktails. If you can afford it, do not miss this restaurant.

Day 7

-got to the Chiang Mai airport for our flight to Kuala Lumpur around 9 am.

-we took Air Asia this time and the leg room and comfort level was definitely a notch above Thai Lion Air. Total flightime was just under three hours.

-Got a Grab from KLIA to Tropicana Residence and it took around an hour.

-got settled in and headed out for some lunch/dinner and sightseeing.

-Tropicana Residences/W hotel are across the street from the PETRONAS towers and KLCC.

-Had some Nasi Lemak on the walk over and the kids had a burger place called Fuel shack in the KLCC food court

-watched the Petronas Towers fountain show at 8:00PM, then went inside and did some shopping. Wife found a Chinese equivalent to Zara called HLA concept store that she loved and did some serious damage at.

-found a mango place in KLCC and holy shit, it was one of the best mangoes I've ever had. Fruit quality is amazing in Malaysia.

Day 8

-Woke up to get ready for Batu Caves. Finally found some really good coffee, but failed to remember the name of the place.

-Took a Grab from Tropicana to Batu Caves were around 30 minutes.

-traffic is absolutely insane in front of Batu Caves, and entering the Batu Caves complex is fairly straightforward. A few warnings about Batu Caves. It is incredible dirty and there is garbage strewn about unfortunately. There is also the very strong scent of rotting garbage and fermenting milk in the air and my wife threw up. One must also consider if they are fit enough to climb 17 flights of stairs in high heat and humidity.

-entering the Batu Caves, you are greeted with a vast cave with a Hindu temple to the left. You will also see tons of monkies running around and playing or fighting. There is also a rooster pen on the right, with about 20 roosters doing their thing. Once you see everything in this cave, you move to the next cave that is even larger and very impressive with shrubbery running up the walls, monkies playing on the walls, bats and various other critters. There is a temple in this cave as well.

-the flight down the stairs from Batu Caves thankfully isn't as bad as going up, but the steepness and occasional monkey getting in your way make it fairly challenging.

-we got a grab to Petalang street which took 30 minutes to arrive and took us another 30 minutes to escape the absolutely mind boggling traffic next to the caves from and side entrance. Our grab driver explained there's also a school that requires pick up and drop off by parents, adding to the traffic. When we got dropped off to Petalang street, we walked around and explored, bought a few souvenirs and found a McDonald's to feed the kids, who by this time in the day were absolutely ready to call it quits. We walked around some more and headed over to the Merdeka 118, that is currently the 2nd tallest building in the world. It's actually not surrounded by any tall buildings, so it looks even more impressive than you might think.

-headed back to Tropicana and jumped in the pool. It's an infinity pool with a direct view of the Petronas Towers and surrounding area. Really special moment that I'll always remember.

-we ordered an extremely famous Saudi chain called Al Baik for dinner on Grab as the kids were too tired to go out again.

Day 9

-Our grab was ready at 10:30am for our flight to Langkawi.

-there are no lounges in the domestic section of KLIA that are available to anyone that isn't travelling Malaysia Air business class

-Flying Batik Air, and so far, this airline has the most comfortable seats and leg space out of the discount airlines I've taken so far on this trip.

-my esim connected to Maxis for the first time rather than Celkom.

-arrived at Ritz Carlton Langkawi, absolutely stunning property and incredible service from the the get go. The rooms were some of the prettiest I've ever seen at a RC/Marriott property. The room had a hand written note from the staff, along with fruits, chocolates, water and some other stuff.

-Walked around the hotel some what and had dinner at the Langkawi Kitchen. Satay was probably the best I've ever had. Extremely expensive, but fairly typical for a RC.

Day 10

-woke up and wanted to relax. We had breakfast and took the kids to the pool. The poolside restaurant had one of the best burgers I've ever had in entire life. It was called the ""Beach Grill Wagyu Beef Burger"" and may of A5 wagyu. I'm still thinking about it to this day.

-hung around the pool and beach the rest of the day. Really just wanted to relax and do nothing after so much travel.

Day 11

-had breakfast and got the kids ready for the day

-we wanted to check out the Langkawi cable car and Sky Bridge.

-before you buy the fast pass, take a look at the line to the left of the ticket counter to see if you actually need to pay for the fast lane.

-we bought the cable car and Sky Bridge tickets...I would suggest adding in the train as well

-the cable car is way steeper and scarier than any other cable car I've been on. You get some truly spectacular views, but the trip up is definitely nerve-racking, especially with how windy it is the higher up you go.

-theres a ""nature walk"" to access the sky bridge, or you can take a short train. The nature walk is about 10 minutes each way and is pretty challenging in the humidity.

-you'll get some great views and some amazing breezes on the sky bridge depending on how busy it is.

-went back down the cable car and explored the Oriental village a bit.

-headed back to the hotel and had some really great dinner at the Hai Fan restaurant at the RC.

Day 12

-Got up early and headed to Langkawi Airport to catch our flight to Singapore on Scoot Airlines

-Scoot doesn't have as much leg room as Batik Air, and about as much as Air Asia. Also, no recline feature at all on any of the economy seats.

-Checked into Marina Bay Sands. It is actually more impressive than it appears in pictures. Front desk upgraded me to a newly renovated suite in Tower 3. This suite was honestly so over the top it was ridiculous.

-after settling in, we headed up to famous infinity pool. It was something of a dream of mine to swin in this pool and I'm happy to say it lived up to that dream. The pool was warm, the views were mind blowing and the service at pool side was exemplary.

-finished up at the pool and walked around Gardens by the Bay, and took my son to a dinosaur themed food court called Jurassic Nest. He's very into dinosaurs at the moment, so it was really special for him.

-the kids were hungry and I took them to a Shake Shack near by (in the Gardens). We walked around some more and headed over to Marina Bay Shoppes. This mall is enormous, and the food court had some great offerings. We got a couple of things for dinner and headed up to our room.

Day 13

-the next morning, my wife was particularly excited because as part of the upgrade to the suite, we were provided free breakfast during our stay. Marina Bays breakfast it a mix of Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Western food. There's a couple extremely high end offerings, including fresh truffle, fish flown in from Japan and raw honey from an actual honey comb. It was probably the best breakfast I have ever had.

-after that we headed over the ArtScience Museum where Teamlabs(the same one as Teamlab Planets in Tokyo) had an experience going on called Future World. The kids loved it, it ate up about an hour and half and it cost $100SGD for a family of four (ouch).

-Went back to the hotel and the pool. Pool visit was cut short because it started raining.

-rested for a few hours and then headed out to Maxwell Food Center to try the famous Tian Tian chicken rice. I knew there would be some grumblings so I got a chilli chicken and rice from the stand right next to it called AliMamas. The chicken rice was good for chicken rice, but I personally don't see the hype about cold chicken. The chilli chicken rice from AliMamas was so good, my wife actually wanted seconds.

-walked over to Chinatown and got some treats for the kids and some souvenir shopping.

-took the MRT back to MBS and got lost on the way. Wasted over an hour an hour on the circle line. Got back to the hotel pretty late, so we just say the Gardens at night. Really cool and definitely something you shouldn't miss.

Day 14

-Wife and son got some more breakfast while my daughter and I slept in. Felt pretty crappy and I'm pretty sure I'm sick at this point.

-went to Changi, checked our bags and went to the Jewel and Butterfly garden. Both were awesome and I loved that there's actually something to do and see at an airport.

-taking EvaAir flight from Singapore to Taipei and then Taipei to Toronto. We got one of the Hello Kitty airplaces, but I didn't notice anything Hello Kitty themed inside.

-definitely the best Premium economy I've been on so far. Huge amount of leg room and space.

-Taipei Airport is kind of a let down and smelled bad. They also took the portable mini-fans I bought my kids on Petaling St. for some reason.

Day 15

-Landed back in YYZ. Usually chaos at YYZ with baggage, but we managed to get out within 1 hour.

Conclusion

Overall, this was an incredible trip for my family and I. Everyone enjoyed almost every minute of it and my wife and I really treasure getting to spend so much time with our kids and showing them so many new things.

I've lived here 45+ years and have tried it many many times, but it just hasn't ever been on my go-to list.  

My wife has been under the weather and was craving their chicken soup, which she enjoys.  (I'm not a soup guy, but I digress.). I break my self-imposed ban on pretending they don't exist to get her a large to-go caldo pollo.  What I got was a quarter chicken stuffed into a coffee cup with some rice, see picture #1.

Picture #2 was swiped from Google, which is more representative of what they serve in the restaurant.  It was verified by same wife who'd eaten it there just last week.

Now friends, I've worked in service industries most of my life.  As a patron I am very generous before I complain, it's gonna take some serious dereliction!  When a customer comes to me with a legitimate complaint I've always made it right, and better, until they are satisfied.  When that hasn't worked I've referred them up the ladder.

This just doesn't happen at Benito's on Magnolia.

I went back to ask for further broth, which I had already paid for but was met only with resistance.  I was told that that's the way they always package it to-go and they don't get complaints.  

I was offered a small amount of broth to-go, which brought the level to Picture #3.  Still not achieving equity with the dine-in presentation.

All I wanted was the same-sized coffee-cup full of just broth, but as I wasn't given any other options I took the proffered broth (literally a measuring cup's worth) and a promise that the manager would call me.  He hasn't. 

Am I expecting too much?  I'd like to go back there tomorrow, order the large caldo pollo for dine-in, wait until it comes out and ask to change it to-go, and see how they fit it ...

Not afraid. Not flustered. Amused. They leaned in, head tilting like they were trying to get a better read on you.

You tried to play it cool, the way you always do. A chuckle, a shake of the head, some nonchalant remark to throw them off. But their eyes didn’t waver.

“I hope you got my good angles. Hate for all that effort to go to waste.”

A joke. They were joking. But there was something underneath it—something knowing.

For the first time, you felt exposed.

Because this wasn’t how it was supposed to go. They weren’t supposed to notice. They weren’t supposed to engage. They weren’t supposed to be… enjoying this?

here’s an example.

(this is a story about a vampire who works at a coffee shop).

Making my way out of the train station, the air smelled sweet; of rain and earth. My work shoes crunched against the pavement as I walked, the coffeehouse nearing closer. The store was a part of a two story shopping complex, wedged beneath a business casual clothing store. Like most buildings here, it was built of brick— adorned with large, emerald green framed windows and a matching glass door. To others, the building seemed out of place; old and rustic—clashing against the modern city sprouting around it. But to me, it was charming and vintage. Closing my umbrella, I pressed my back against the entrance and let myself in. Resting by the front counter was my manager. His eyes lit up when he saw me, a cherub-esque smile splitting his face in half. “Nice to see you, Ms. Katz.” Abe stepped away from the counter, and towards me. I didn’t want him to get closer, I cringed. He always smelled of unbaked, sour bread—and looked like it too. Soft, and beige. His face was round and doughy, with sunken in eyes that rivaled the wrinkliest of raisins. A bulbous nose settled in-between them, with thick-framed glasses askew on the tip. Underneath it, swollen pink lips. Rough little patches of acne swelled beneath his cheeks, tinging his skin a slight coral red. As I walked towards him, I plastered on a bright, fake smile. Smiling back, Abe’s already reddened cheeks colored further. “Nice to see you today, Ms. Katz.” “You said that already.” I stated, forcing my eyes not to roll. Mortals were such easy prey. A girl catches their gaze, and suddenly they’re rendered brainless. Right now, Abe’s mouth gaped soundlessly, searching for the right words. Per usual, a touch of compulsion came in handy. “Did you do something different today? You look—nice.” That’s the most I knew Abe would give me. Nodding, another faux-smile stretched across my lips. “Yeah, I just tried some new moisturizer, that’s all.” By the lit-up look in Abe’s eyes, I could tell moisturizer didn’t mean jack to him. Dollar signs practically danced in his pupils. “You need to work register today.” Knew it. All prior times I’d worked register, the tip jar had nearly overflown.

Shuffling past the front counter, I looked over our work area, assessing the amount of time it would take to set up shop. The tall, black steeled shelves were empty from closing shift, so we’d definitely have to restock. Each morning, we lined them with bulky bags of coffee mixes, a pain to carry. Below the shelves, sat shiny wooden countertops. Running my hand against them, I could still feel some sticky residue—some four-oh-nine would do the job. Atop the finished wood, rested our equipment—two compact blenders, a rusty espresso machine, a coffee grinder. Upon my further inspection, they seemed clean enough.",2,1741836112.0,writers,8,1.0,False
1ja2sfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ja2sfi/what_are_some_style_over_substance_board_games/,What are some “Style Over Substance” Board Games you’ve fallen for?,"Have you ever been drawn to a game because of its stunning components and theme, only to get it on your table and find that it was all bells and whistles? 

I’m curious what are some underwhelming games you’ve played that felt more style over substance.

For me, I thought I was pretty good at sussing out these games (like overproductions of miniatures on kickstarter).

But recently played **Coffee Rush**, which currently has a 7.2 on BGG. All the reviews said it was a fun great game and none mentioned the negative points that I ended up encountering when I played. It even won awards, and for all its overproduction of cute components, it was not a crowdfunded game which made me lower my guard and go for it.

I’m exactly the kind of player the game is targeting—the miniature ingredient components completely sold me. But once I started playing, those miniatures quickly became a hassle. You’d often pick up ingredients just to discard them back to the pile in the same turn. They became more fiddly than fun and often made me think “what’s the point..” and wouldn’t even bother putting them in my cup if I completed the recipe same round.

Don’t get me wrong, some other game mechanics were very nice but if its main selling point are those components and they underwhelm so much, then I do see it as “style over substance”. I don’t know if the designers should have changed something in the game loop to allow for the ingredients to stay longer on your board.

Perhaps it didn’t work in the game’s favour that just a couple of hours earlier, I had played **Da Luigi**. What a hidden great gem of a lightweight game that one was! Sitting at 6.4 on BGG. It is a 2015 game with a very similar gameplay but uses simple colored cubes instead of fancy miniatures. And yet, Da Luigi felt smoother, more strategic, you could really mess with your opponents, and just better designed overall.

McDonald’s.,"Ok just want to put this out there. When I was working at McDonald’s, I found out how they deal with roaches. If you’re eating or something fair warning this may cause you to be grossed out. For people that HATE roaches you might not want to read and might not want to eat or drink from McDonald’s. 

Ok so, I used to work the opening shift at my local McDonald’s. They had a roach problem like how most fast food places do. I never realized how they may deal with it. I worked the window. It was where you make the coffees and have to refill all the ice machines. I have photos of some of the roaches but it won’t let me post them. I may be dumb tho. Anyways. 

The roaches love to be around that area. They are everywhere and you know what management tells me? “Don’t worry about them just leave them be” gross. They would be in the coffee area all over the machines and all over the place. They will be in our ice storage and when I told management they said just leave it. Really gross. I tried to dig them out but it was very difficult and I would get in trouble for not doing my job and instead be cleaning died roaches out of the ice storages. The ice we use in drinks. Absolutely nasty.
The ice machine that makes all the ice had a bunch of roaches die in them. Nasty. I tried to not get any roaches when collecting ice. 

They would live in the ice storage for the fountain drinks I would open it up then have a good 5 or 6 run out. I didn’t do anything about it. I didn’t think there was anything to do about it. I ended up quitting. Anytime I see someone with a McDonald’s drink I gag. It grosses me out too much. If you ever go anywhere you might want to just skip the ice in that drink. 
They don’t clean the ice machines and they usually start to grow mold. I know the one we had was covered in mold. ",0,1741835846.0,confession,13,0.44,False

When they unbag their food, it is a whole Chinese meal which they ate with chopsticks while class was going on. 

This was uncharted territory which I can handle differently in the future. Of course, I would always accommodate a person’s health needs, but the question is:

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Who are you, actually. How do you understand life and yourself. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

1ja2n0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ja2n0x/please_i_need_advice_cant_tell_if_my_boyfriend_is/,please i need advice - can’t tell if my boyfriend is codependent with his family or if im being dramatic,"i’ve been feeling like a non priority for awhile. before we lived together, i had this fear i’d always come second, but i also (maybe stupidly) assumed that once we moved in and made our own home together, we’d fall even more in love and prioritize our new life.

well, we’ve been living together for a few months now, and i feel like even less of a priority than i did before. lol. 

for context, i lived with a friend for 3 years and then had my own place for 1. my boyfriend has always lived at home, which sounds like a huge red flag i know, but his job (which he shares with his dad) has him out of town a lot and it didn’t make sense for him to buy an empty house to come home to after days on the road. 

the first few weeks after we moved in, he stopped by his parents every single day after work because “its on the way” or he “told his mom he’d stop and have coffee sometimes after working the night shift.” 

i don’t know why it bothered me so much, but it did. also, you’re up all night and exhausted, but before coming home to crash, you stop by your parents to have coffee???

idk regardless, some other things like that continued to occur and we’ve now had multiple conversations about how i don’t feel prioritized, desired (our sex life is nonexistent anymore), or like he’s ever going to put me first. he’s apologized and said he’s going to be better, but nothing has changed thus far.

to avoid writing an entire novel (which will likely occur anyways bc context) we’ll just skip to how this past week has gone. he had off last thursday and day of (even though he knows i hate last minute plans), said his parents invited us over for dinner. I said okay well you and they both know i work til 5 we can head over after. he gets a call (mind you he was also with them all morning doing gosh knows what) and then comes in while im working to say they want him to go over early since he’s off and he might do that. i said i thought we’d just go together, doesn’t really make sense to drive separately when it was literally 3:30. he says okay he’ll wait. he then gets another call and i hear him talking in his “baby voice” to his little nephew and i swear i just knew it was going to happen. he comes in and says he’s just going to head over now and i can meet him, since even after im done with work i’ll have to “get ready” and that his family “likes to eat early.” so they use his nephew to guilt him (which has been done before) and now oust me from dinner? even when they know i work until the same exact time every weekday?

i ended up not going and enjoyed some alone time. we had a conversation and he couldn’t understand why i was upset because “it’s a quick drive” and his parents “have delayed their dinner many times” for me in the past. which just isn’t true, i’m always eating a plate by myself (sometimes with my bf now that we live together) at 5:30/6PM. i can think of one time his BROTHER delayed dinner because of my schedule.

whatever, moving on.

sunday - we had a great day. sat outside, made dinner, watched our show until he went to work the night shift.

monday - stopped by his parents for 2 hours after work to pick up gosh knows what. came home and slept. woke up, picked up his parents to go buy a FB marketplace mower, took it back to THEIR house and stayed another few hours doing gosh knows what. finally came home to play games with me and my friends which was already planned.

tuesday - he goes to the gym then immediately to his parents to put the battery in his motorcycle and go on a ride with his dad. comes home with only an hour to get ready for work. tells me he’s going to breakfast with his parents tomorrow after he drops off my car for inspection, that they invited us for dinner on thursday (“but don’t feel like you have to”), and on friday, he’s going on an all day ride with his dad and his dad’s friends. then comes home from work and tells me he WON’T be gone all morning wednesday before he works again, he’s just going to drop my car off, get breakfast, then come home.

wednesday (today)- he drops my car off, goes to breakfast, then again is at his parents for hours doing gosh knows what. comes home and tells me his mom is going to pick him up, so they can go get my car and he’ll bring it home. i said that we (meaning him and i) could go pick up my car and he says no it’s fine bc im working (i work from home) and he’s going on a bike ride with his dad anyways. then he asks if i want to come and i said im working. i apparently said it with an attitude and that upset him. his mom shows up and they leave. he comes back 1.5 hours before work and i say i’m going outside to read. he keeps asking me what’s wrong and then makes a comment how he only has an hour before work and i don’t even want to hang out with him. which is hilarious bc i’ve been done with work for hours and we could have been “hanging out” that entire time. he leaves for work and that’s where we are.

now tomorrow he has off and will definitely spend the whole day again at his parents while i work. i guess im supposed to head over there for dinner an hour later than everyone else. friday he also has off and will be on a ride with his dad and his dads friends as mentioned. then he’s back to work on saturday.

i’m just so sad and tired. i tell him i need more intimacy and to feel like a priority and he says he’s going to be better, but nothing changes. if anything he’s spending even MORE time away from our house and at his parents, even though he has a running list of things he wants to do here. 

TLDR: my boyfriend sees his parents at least 5 days a week. i’ve told him i don’t feel like a priority, always come second, want date nights, more intimacy, etc. and he says he’s going to do better—but nothing changes. he always schedules plans with them on both his off days  and this week he’s seen them literally every single day.",1,1741835515.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1ja2m77,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ja2m77/i_am_exhausted_and_no_one_cares/,I am exhausted and no one cares.,"I worked really hard to be a manager at work. Busted my ass for years to get to where I am. It's nothing glorious, but I really love my job, and I am so glad to be where I am. I manage a kitchen and have about 12 employees below me. I am well-liked at work, and I am respected. 

At home is a different story. I have 3 kids, and a husband, but I just don't feel loved or cared for at all. I take care of everything, and everyone, but no one takes care of me. 

My husband and I work opposite shifts. I work 6am to 2pm and he works 3pm to 11pm. One of us are always home for the kids, and that part is great, except I'm off when the kids are, so he only has to take care of them if someone is sick or something like that. We both have weekends off. 

We both work the same amount of hours, but he works more days in a year than I do. 

His sister recently moved back to town, and I take care of her daughter while she works also. I don't mind, and I'm actually really glad to have them around. 

But I am so damn tired. 

I work all day, then I pick the kids up, come home, take everyone to where they need to go, cook dinner, do housework, take care of the kids, shower, and go to bed. 

My husband wakes up in the morning, gets the kids ready for school (just tells them to get ready and then he gets in the shower), takes them to school, and then has the rest of the mid-day to himself. He hasn't been helping with the housework much. He starts the dishwasher when he gets home (it's the kind that has to be hooked up to the sink), he sets up the coffee maker for the next day, and he switches the laundry when someone urgently needs something. I do everything else. 

On the weekends, he wants to sit around and watch TV. 

Today I kinda lost it on him, I don't understand why he doesn't do the majority of the housework. I'm working as many hours as he does, and then I have all 4 kids at home, while he is home alone. 

He has narcolepsy and he blames a lot on that. There are a lot of days when he says ""when I got home from taking the kids to school, I sat down in my chair, and I couldn't help it, I just fell asleep"". I get it, but also, he has a medication he can take to stay awake, he just doesn't take it until right before work. He also won't take it on the weekends, so he spends a lot of time sleeping. 

Our sleep schedules are different, so on the weekends I get up around 6AM and I am ready for bed by 9PM.  He wants to get up at 10AM, and stay up until 1AM or later but I just can't do that. Because of this, our love life is taking a nose dive. I don't want to stay up past midnight for intimacy, and I don't want to do it at 11AM when all the kids are awake. 

I get pissed off every time I see reels or tiktoks of men doing nice things for their wives, because my husband would never even consider doing things like that for me. Those videos make me cry because I just want to be taken care of sometimes. 

For Valentine's, he didn't do anything for me. He was working on something, but got sick with COVID and couldn't finish it. I get it, but I had the flu at the same time and made sure he had breakfast on Valentine's, and then got him some candy after Valentine's when it was on sale (like 2 days later when I was over the flu). He's made no attempts to make up for it. 

My birthday is coming up and it's going to be the same story. He won't do anything unless I push it hard before that. 

I just want to crawl in a hole and never come out. 

That bit on the movie ""Bad Moms"" where Kristin Bell's character talks about daydreaming of getting into an accident where she has to spend time in the hospital, I think about it all the time. Man, it would be nice to be taken care of for a week or two. 

I have a lot of friends, but we don't get together much during the winter. Recently, they have been distant. One is super involved in an online community, and she just doesn't reach out much and when we hang out she is on her computer the whole time. Another won't go or do really anything during the winter because she doesn't want to get sick (understandable, and she has a little one). Another friend moved back to town, and I've been going to see her about once a week, but it's been very surface-level, and when we are together, we have 6 kids between the two of us, so it's loud and busy and not much time for deep conversation. 

Today I went to parent-teacher conferences alone, and my kids were being kind of rambunctious. Then my youngest slapped me hard in front of one of the teachers. I don't hit my kids, they get stern words and timeouts, but I don't spank them. I don't know where it came from or why she thought that was an appropriate reaction. I was embarrassed, and overwhelmed, and when I called my husband to try to get some support, he just wanted to yell at her. It wasn't helpful. 

I just want to be pampered and care for, even just thought about. 

Anyway, that's all. Tomorrow I'll get up and do it all again. Over and over. ",2,1741835439.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1ja2lae,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ja2lae/hf_consequences_5518_words/,"[HF] Consequences (5,518 words)","The clouds lied, hanging heavy in the sky and darkening the land beneath with their slow-moving shadows.  They hinted at rain, but that was unlikely this early in the year.  Snow, maybe.  Even that was a lie.  Rain or snow, neither would fall here.  The valley would remain barren and lifeless for another month, at least.  A chill wind drove the clouds east.

The hiss of the breeze all but smothered the clop-clop-clop of hooves.  The horse's head hung low, bent in a tired arc that mimicked that of it's rider.  Its coat was the soft no-color of dust and the road.  The rider's clothes were equally dun.  The silver pendant in his hat band, slightly tarnished, belied the monotone.  And the matte iron of his guns was its own counterpoint.

Feather Macready pulled the hat from his head, fanning himself once, twice, in an unconscious habit more than from need.  The rare instances of sunlight were hardly warming.  Only in the whiskey-fueled fire of his belly was he truly warm.

He examined the sun, shading his eyes with one hand before re-donning the hat.  Experienced eyes measured the height of the sun above the horizon.  He grunted softly and spurred the horse back into movement.  Feather figured he could get a few more miles in before dusk.  Might even clear this valley, he thought.

Any distance was good distance in Feather's book.  The farther the better.  He could outpace the news if he kept going.  Wasn't a telegraph in that podunk town two days behind him.  The posse chasing him had turned back earlier that day.  More interested in seeing him gone than dancing at the end of a rope.  They had Jasper for that.

With a little effort, Feather could outpace everything but the guilt.  Wasn't much to feel guilty about.  It had been Jasper's fault, after all.  Jasper and the sheriff.  But any guilt is enough.  Enough to twist in the gullet and gnaw your soul.  You can't outrun guilt.  But, he thought, you could drown it at the bottom of a bottle.

Three hours later, well into dusk, Feather made camp.  He'd reached the mouth of the valley, finding a small hollow with a pleasant little pool of ice-cold water.  After a meal of beans and dried beef boiled into a stew, he settled down to sleep.  Half a bottle later, sleep finally came.  As he slept, the embers of his fire cast Hades' own glow on his face.

  
Oh, God, Feather thought.  He drew the straight.  He hid a wince as he watched the blaze of triumph rise in Jasper's eyes.  It was a triumph obvious to him but not to the others, he suspected.  He knew Jasper of old, could read his tells like a telegraph.  Not many could.

It had promised to be a quiet evening, for a change.  A meal.  A few drinks.  Mayhap even a whore if he could find one without the pox.  But, no, it wasn't going to work out that way.  Where there are saloons there are cards and the men to play them.  Hard-drinking men, quick to anger.

If only Jasper hadn't spotted the open seat at the table.  If only the other players hadn't made him for an easy mark, a mistake many made.  A mistake Jasper was quick to take up on.  In dozens of gambling parlors stretching back east, Jasper's face and skill were recalled with lament.  If only, Feather thought.  The two most useless words there were.

Jasper laid the cards before him, face down.  One hand played with his coins, stacking them in a relentless series of faint, metallic clicks.  Beside the coins was a rustling pile of bills in a variety of denominations.  Salted in with the bills were tokens, bits of jewelry, and a watch that others had used in lieu of cash when the pot got big.  What value the trinkets had was up for question.

""Bet's to me?"" he asked, knowing full well it was.  The other players nodded, several impatiently.  His staccato play was just one of the weapons in his arsenal.  And annoyed opponent was a sloppy one.

Feather, a table away, watched them over his mug of beer.  Unnoticed by anyone, his hand drifted down to rest on the butt of his revolver.  The faint snap of the buckle keeping the strap in place went equally unremarked.  He could skin the gun if he needed to.  And, he thought ruefully, he probably would.

""Twenty,"" Jasper said, tossing a pair of big, gold coins with a casual flick of his hand.  They rang musically as they joined the pot.

""Fold,"" the next player said, sliding his cards into the center of the table.  A second followed suit, saying nothing but expressing everything on his face.  His stack was tiny, second shortest in the bunch.  Jasper had milked him well all night.

""Call,"" said the third.

""And ten more,"" said the fourth, more boy than man.  He pushed several bills into the pile, singles and fives.  His stash was almost gone, but his gesture was smooth and even, betraying no nervousness about his meagre funds.  Confident, Feather thought.  Confident or desperate.

Jasper met the extra ten and put another ten in on top.  He did it slowly, reaching for his cards but not picking them up.  His hesitant act, Feather thought.  Doesn't work on some, does work on most.  The third player folded with a snort of irritation.

The boy sighed and examined his hand again.  Bad move, Feather thought.  Not just the sigh.  If you don't know what you have in your hand without looking every bet, you shouldn't play.  ""Everything I got,"" he said, pushing in his remaining stake.  The short stack of coins tipped over across the remaining paper.  ""Fifty-seven dollars.""

""Raising forty-seven, then?"" Jasper asked.

""Yep.""

Jasper called immediately, all hesitation gone.  The boy's face fell.  He moved to examine his cards one more time, pointless now that he'd been called.  As far away as he was, Feather could see the vein at the boy's temple begin to pulse, his cheeks growing flush.  Jasper saw it, too.

Tried to buy the pot, Feather thought.  Didn't work, though.  Jasper's got him beat and everyone knows it.  Beneath the table, hidden from view, Feather half-drew his Colt.  He closed his eyes for a moment, saving a few last moments of peace before the thunder began.

Jasper nodded to the cards.  ""What you have under there, son?""

The boy's flush deepened as he flipped his cards.  ""Two pair,"" he said with a quaver.  ""Jacks and sixes.""

""Good hand, son,"" Jasper said.  His patronizing tone could have curdled milk.  ""Right good hand, most games.  Not good enough in this 'n.""  With a showman's gesture, Jasper flipped the bottom most card in his hand.  The other cards flipped in turn as if by magic.  They were a mix of suits, sure enough, but a straight nonetheless.  ""Straight to the ten.""

Jasper leaned forward, scooping the pot towards him with one hand, his other remaining on the table.  On the table, not far from his left hip.  Unlike Feather, Jasper wore two guns, one on each hip.  And, unlike most, Jasper was lightning and thunder with either hand.  This, too, was part of his legend in cards.  Even the angriest loser balked at a naked smoke-wagon.  Most times.

""Damn your luck,"" the boy said, standing quickly.

""Ain't luck, son.  It's skill.""

""You been milking me and Clyde all night.  A small loss here, small win there.  Always come out ahead a coin or two.  Now you've gone and broke me.  Got nothing left.""

""If you can't lose the money, son, don't play.""  Jasper stood slowly, his left hand now nakedly on his belt just above the gun.  In his right, he still clutched a fistful of bills, as much a distraction as a need to pocket the cash.  It'd be there regardless, and Jasper figured he'd still be standing to collect it.  Of course, Feather thought, he always has been so far.

""Way you play, probably shouldn't sit at the table no how.""  Jasper's smirk, like everything, was calculated.  The other men at the table stood slowly, backing away.  What would come next was nothing they wanted to be a part of.

""Son of a ..."" the boy snapped, his hand reaching for his gun.  Anger and drink slowed him, but he was still faster than most.  Feather remained seated, but drew his own gun fully, keeping the skinned weapon beneath the table.

The boy's hand was still moving, just touching the grip when Jasper's own flashed.  His smooth, oiled grace belied impossible swiftness.  The gun appeared in his hands as if by magic, the solemn mouth of the barrel level with the boy's eyes.  The boy hadn't blinked.  Hadn't seen the gun move.  One moment he was drawing, the next he was doomed.

""What's your name, boy?"" Jasper asked, silky menace in his whisper.  ""For the tombstone or so's I can tell your momma you died hard.""

The boy gulped, his hand frozen on its path.  His eyes crossed, focused against his will on the octagonal muzzle winking at him.  The brass cartridge nestled at its base was invisible, but he imagined he could see light gleam from it's nose just the same.  His eyes tried to trace the faint etchings of the barrel's rifling.  It made him dizzy.

""Name, son,"" Jasper repeated.  ""Don't like to kill a man I ain't been introduced to all proper, like.""

""William,"" the boy croaked.  ""William Gruff.""

 ""Walk away, William Gruff.  Finish that whiskey you've been nursing the last half hour, turn around, and walk away.  Ain't never shot a man in the back and never shot a man who stood down.  Do both, and you'll live to see morning.  Anything else and you're gonna meet old Saint Pete in a flash.""

William's chest heaved, angry gusts of breath pulsing.  He slowly moved his hand away from his gun, reaching down to the half-empty shot-glass at his place.  With exaggerated caution, he picked it up and drained it.  ""You, sir,"" he said quietly, ""are a snake.  A low down, yellow-bellied snake.  And if I don't kill you now, someone else will later.""  He turned quickly, drawing his eyes from the barrel's mesmerizing twists, and strode to the bar.  ""Bottle,"" he said, slapping his hand down.

""Billy,"" the barman said, ""you ain't got nothing to pay for it.""

""One of my brothers'll pay for it tomorrow.  Gimme.  And don't call me Billy, that's a boy's name and I ain't no boy no more.""

""Guess not,"" the barman said.  ""Anyone old enough to lose all he has at cards is man enough.""  Still uncertain, the barman handed over a bottle, one of the cheaper ones only a step up from rotgut and snake venom.

William took the bottle with a steady hand, pulled the cork and took a long swig.  A trickle of whiskey escaped from the corner of his mouth as he turned his gaze back to Jasper.  Jasper was still standing, but his gun no longer followed the boy.  He’d returned it to its holster, but that fooled no one.  As quick as a rattler’s tongue and it would be out again if the needs be.  William glared, mouthing words no one heard, and strode towards the stairs.  The crackle of the hearth fire and the stomp of his boots were the only sounds in the saloon.  At the top of the stairs, he grabbed the arm of the girl closest to him.  She gave a nervous shriek, but followed him into the first open room.  The door’s slam was very loud.

The piano began to play once more, a jaunty tune to take the tension from the air.  Conversations began again, low and quiet at first but gradually returning to the sussurating din common in any saloon.  Glasses clinked and, somewhere in the back, billiard balls clicked.  Slowly, the saloon returned to normal.

Jasper sat, armed over the pot and began to sort it absently with one hand.  He tossed a one-dollar coin into the center of the table and smiled.  “My ante’s in, who’s up for more?”

The others sat back down and fished in their own antes.

The game would have gone on all night had not the noise from upstairs continually interrupted.  Bangs and slams were accompanied by the occasional shriek.  Jasper’s cool smile widened with each noise, his eyes showing an ever deepening cold satisfaction.  One of his opponents dropped out of the game after less than a quarter hour of further play.  A second dropped out only a few minutes later.

“That ruckus upstairs is your fault, you know,” the only remaining player said.  He was a portly man with sad hound’s eyes and a sheen of sweat on his balding pate.  He held his hand tightly, his fingers white as they bent the cards.

“How do you figure?” Jasper asked, tossing a coin into the pot between them.  “Five.”

“You rode the kid all night.  Billy’s none too stable.  None of the Gruffs are.  You hadn’t rode him, he’d have bowed out with a little money in his purse.”

“Not my problem if the boy can’t gamble.”

“Cards ain’t war, son,” the older man said.  “You treat your players like dung and like as not you’ll have no-one to play with.  Like now, for instance.”  The man tossed his hand in, folding, and gestured with it at the empty seats.  “I’m taking my remaining stake and going home, son.  Game ain’t interesting no more.”

“Winning’s always interesting,” Jasper said, collecting the defaulted pot.  His stacks of coins and sundries stood far higher than they had at night’s beginning.  With one hand, he sorted them, counting almost absent-mindedly.  The sundries—a watch, two rings, and a folded silver clip—he slid into his purse.  They’d bear further examination later.

“But it ain’t everything, son,” the man said, stepping away from the table.  “Like as not you’ll learn that someday.  Won’t be a pleasant learning.  Reckon you already know that.”

“Sure do.  Been learning hard my whole life.  Ain’t no reason to change now.”

Up the stairs, a door opened suddenly, crashing into the wall beside it with a slam and the tortured squeal of over-stressed hinges.  Footsteps made heavy with anger clomped towards the stairs.  Jasper turned, one hand going south as he did.  But he didn’t stand.  Not yet.

“No, Billy!” the girl cried.  “He’ll kill you.  Just come on back to bed.”

William Gruff, his shirt opened and his suspenders hanging loose, stood at the top of the stairs.  His gun belt was nowhere to be seen, but the rifle in his hands more than made up for it.  The long, oiled iron of the barrel glimmered in the light from below.  He levered the action, chambering a round with a click-clack sound.

“Gonna get me my money back,” he said, and began to descend the stairs.

“You ain’t got no more money, boy,” Jasper said, turning fully to face the stairs.  “You had it, now I got it.  Go on back up with the girl, get your ashes hauled.  Or do you rut as poorly as you gamble?”

“Bastard!” William shouted, raising the gun.  The girl clutched at his waist, throwing him slightly off balance.  Her pleading went unheard by either man.  The barman’s call fell on deaf ears as well.  The rifle’s roar struck the room like thunder. 

Maybe it was the girl hanging on him, Feather thought as he flashed for his gun.  Maybe that made him miss.  Not any man ever built can dodge a bullet, not even Jasper fast as he is.  But, William’s shot had gone wide, punching a splintered hole in the poker table.  The felt smoked where it had peeled away from the impact. 

Jasper rolled to one side, kicking the chair behind him as he did so.  He came to his knees, drawing a gun with each hand as he did so.  As before, the guns flashed up as if by magic.  A twitch and suddenly his hands held guns, only his restraint—what little of it there was—kept the fire in check.  He thumbed back both hammers, cocking the old Colts with the easy motion of long practice.

The boy cocked the rifle again, bringing it down from his shoulder to do so.  It was a youngster’s move, the sign of a boy not yet familiar with his rifle.  Criminal, Feather thought, that a boy like this would have a gun he wasn’t ready for.  It’s going to get him killed.

The girl kept screaming, pulling at William from her knees.  He pulled away from her just as violently, their tug of war throwing his aim off just enough.  The second bullet snapped past Jasper to thud into the hearth behind him.  The impact sent a flurry of sparks and cinders across the room, showering a half-dozen patrons with ash as they, too, dove for cover.

Jasper fired three times, twice with his right hand and once with his left.  Angry, Feather thought.  He usually only fires twice.  Sometimes but once if he’s really got the drop on the fella.  Feather’s own gun was out now, the .36 caliber Navy Revolver still aimed at the floor.

Feather was wrong, however.  Jasper was no more angry now than he had been at the gaming table.  The third shot simply made up for the errant path of the second.  Had the two not been struggling so, his second wouldn’t have missed.  Both the girl and the boy fell, tumbling down the stairs with the rag-doll limbs of the mortally wounded or dead.  The drumming of their bodies was almost lost in the ringing that followed the thunder.  Jasper’s guns were back in their holsters and strapped down before the bodies reached the bottom.

Will landed first, a second or so before the girl.  He landed face up, his eyes clouding as death took him.  Two spreading blood-stains spotted his shirt, the second centered over his heart.  The girl landed atop him, one leg still shuddering in a death tattoo as her shattered brain fired its last messages.  Blood and other less mentionable things poured across William’s face and shoulder.  Jasper’s second shot had torn away a jagged chunk of hair and bone before the bullet had deflected down, into her skull.

“Somebody get the Sheriff,” someone said.  The bat-winged saloon doors flapped as someone else obeyed, boots slamming the boardwalk outside as he ran.

“Son,” the barman said carefully, “I know you put them guns back in their holsters, but I’d appreciate it a mite if you’d keep your hands away from ‘em.”

Both Feather and Jasper turned towards the barman, Feather somewhat slower.  The barman held a scattergun, both barrels trained steady on Jasper.  At this range, their shot would spread enough to ensure a hit but not enough to lessen their fatal strength.  They quivered slightly, twitching in time to the barman’s pulse.

“Just defending myself, girl got in the way.”

“Maybe the sheriff will see it that way, and maybe he won’t.”

Feather, just outside the focus of the barman’s vision, moved slowly towards the bar.  His gun remained out, but he kept it low.  With luck, he won’t see me.

“There’s a bullet in that there table and another in the hearth that says so,” Jasper said, taking a slow stride towards the barman.  There wasn’t any harm in it, at this range the scattergun wouldn’t miss—in closer, before the shot could spread, it might.

“Won’t matter.  Sheriff is William’s eldest brother, all he’s gonna care about is you killed his kin.  And killing the girl ain’t gonna help your cause, none.”

“Jolene was a whore, mayhap, but she’s a boot-lace relation of the judge, “said a voice from the crowd gathered in the corner.  “Or, at least everyone says so.  Last couple of fellas who beat on her came to regret it powerful.”

Feather reached the bar, his gun still low and seemingly unobserved.  At least, he thought, no one in the crowd’s said anything and the barman hasn’t told me to stop.  “Can I get a beer,” Feather said, “something to clear the powder-smoke from my lungs?”

The barman’s gaze never left Jasper.  The gun never moved. “Pretty sure I’m done sellin’ booze tonight, son.  And holster the hog leg.  Don’t think I didn’t see it.”

Feather smiled ruefully and slipped the gun back into its place at his hip with an exaggerated motion.  “Perish the thought,” he said.  “Still, one beer?  He ain’t going nowhere.  Least not with the lot of them blocking the doors.”  Feather waved at the crowd gathered at the front of the bar.  They were, indeed, blocking the batwings.  Still, the barman’s gaze and gun remained fixed on Jasper.

“Fast as he is, I don’t think so.  He draws on me, maybe I’ll get him and maybe I won’t.  But as long as I’ve got this out and on him, he’ll stay all peaceable-like until the sheriff shows up.”

“From what you’re saying,” Jasper said, “that don’t sound like it’s in my best interests.  What makes you think I won’t just shoot my way out of here?”

“Two things,” the barman said.  “The right barrel and the left.  And stop moving, stand right where you are.  You’re thinking maybe you’re close enough to twitch out the way.  Maybe the buck will only crease your side.  Might be the case, might not.  But them over there all have a gun each and you’ve got nine bullets left, maybe less.”

“Them’s Colt Dragoons he’s wearing,” a gravelly voice said from the crowd.  “Ain’t seen any like ‘em since before the War, but I recognize ‘em sure enough.  Single-action.  Ain’t no way he can thumb those hammers fast enough to get us all.”

“I’m not willing to bet on that, Clyde,” another voice said.  “You pegged him as an easy mark at cards, too.  You all go on and rush him if you want.  Me, I’ll just wait for the sheriff.”

Jasper turned his gaze on the crowd, dismissing the barman and his scattergun with almost contempt.  He stared into one set of eyes after another, holding them just long enough to get a quick assessment of the men.  “You fellas gonna side with the sheriff on this one?  Or you gonna tell the truth, that the boy shot first, shot twice before I put him down.”

Some of the men nodded or murmured their assent.  Others stayed quiet.  Feather’s own gaze grew cold.  The numbers were about even.  Not good, he thought.  Even if he gets a trial, ain’t going to be a fair one.

“All right, then,” Jasper said.  “Let’s just wait.”

It wasn’t five minutes later when the heavy stride of boots and a faint jingle of spurs announced the sheriff’s arrival.  Great, Feather thought, he’s the sort who wears his spurs all the time.  Cocky.  Probably ex-army.  A cavalryman.  Impatient, happy to shoot, and, sure as a bear shits proud.

The batwings opened in a rush, slapping men out of their way as the sheriff stiff-armed them.  He was a tall man, his hat adding enough to his height that he only just fit in below the lintel.  The star on his breast, polished as it was to an ostentatious shine, winked back the orange light of the gas-lamps.  His eyes surveyed the scene quickly, one hand going to the gun at his hip.  The mother-of-pearl grip of the revolver shone with a light all its own before he covered it with a palm.  He strode directly over to Jasper, that one hand never leaving the butt of the gun.

“Killed my brother,” he said with a rasp.

“Didn’t know he was your brother,” Jasper replied.  “And he shot at me first.”

“Don’t matter to me, none,” the sheriff said.  “Kin is kin, ain’t matter how they died just that they did.  You’re gonna swing for this.  Dance on air.”

“Sheriff,” Feather said, “There are witnesses here who saw the whole thing.  They’ll tell you the boy—” Feather paused a moment, seeing the look on the sheriff’s face, “excuse me, they’ll tell you they saw William shoot first.”

“Witnesses speak at trial, this here ain’t gonna get one.”  The sheriff grabbed Jasper, roughly pinning one arm behind his back as he shoved him into the bar.  Jasper’s breath left him in a gust of pain as the railing caught him in the stomach.  The gust became a snarl of anger as the sheriff slammed Jasper’s head town, knocking him hard against the polished surface of the bar top.

“Everyone gets a trial, sheriff,” Feather said.  “Even those caught red-handed.  And he wasn’t.  Defendin’ yourself is legal.”

“In my parish,” the sheriff replied, “I decide what’s legal.  Killin’ my kin ain’t.  Never was, never is, never gonna be.”  He kicked Jasper’s feet out from under him.  Jasper went boneless as the brass railing caught him under the chin.  He slumped to the floor in a puddle around the sheriff’s feet.

“That ain’t right.”

“Sorry that you think so.  You gonna be a problem, boy?”

“If makin’ sure he gets a fair and proper trial is a problem, then mayhap I will be.”

“George,” the sheriff called over his shoulder, “Sam, take this boy into custody.”

Two deputies strode through the crowd from where they’d been happy to watch their boss work.  Feather backed up two steps, but left his hands visible.  Going for his gun was likely to get him killed.

“I haven’t done anything, sheriff,” he said.  “No cause to arrest me.”

“I’m thinking you’re drunk and disorderly.  Arguing with the duly appointed local peace officer.”

“I ain’t had more than a couple of drinks, sheriff.  Ask the barman.  Besides, if being drunk’s a crime then your jail must have a whole shit-pot bunch of cells.  I count six or seven drunks over in that crowd from the way they’re swaying.”

Jasper moaned and tried to sit up.  The sheriff slammed his heel back into Jasper’s collarbone, the spur cutting a gash into one cheek.  Jasper folded back to the floor with a shudder.  The sheriff kicked back twice more for good measure.  The wet snap of a breaking bone was audible to everyone in the bar.  “Stay down, boy,” he said.  “Them other drunks ain’t my problem tonight, you are.”

George and Sam flanked Feather, each grasping one elbow in strong hands.  “Come quiet like,” George said.  “Unless you wanna get what you’re friend there is getting.”

Feather slumped and let them escort him out.  The crowd at the door parted to let them pass.  Behind, the sheriff dragged Jasper out by the collar of his shirt.  Jasper moaned as the broken ribs ground together with each tug.

Nothing for it, Feather thought.  They ain’t got a gallows here.  Not up and ready to go.  Jasper’s got a couple of days at least.  Mayhap I can manage something between now and then.  Talk to the magistrate, maybe the mayor.  Words echoed in his mind.  “She’s kin to the judge,” a voice said.  “Last fellas who beat on her came to regret it.”  Feather sagged a bit more.

“Come on, fellow,” Sam said.  “Your friend’s got a date with a rope, but you’re just gonna spend a night or two in irons and Tom will let you go.”

“Unless you cause any more trouble or go around shooting that fool mouth off again,” George added.

They were just even with the horses when Feather made his move.  He’d never been as fast as Jasper—nobody he’d met was.  But he was faster than most.  He exaggerated his slump, pulling the two deputies off balance for a stride or more.  As they stumbled, he stood erect, snapping his arms free.  With an equally sudden motion he fished his gun out from where the gun belt hung over Sam's shoulder.  Loose as it was, the belt came partway with the gun, falling to the dirt with a clatter of brass that was swallowed in the gun’s bark.

Where Jasper carried Colt Dragoons, Feather carried an 1851 Colt Naval revolver.  Like Jasper’s, the Feather’s gun was more than thirty years old.  It was also considerably lighter.  Where a Dragoon’s .44 roared, Feather’s .36 merely barked.  Still, a bullet of any size in the foot hurts more than a little.  Sam yowled and fell, clutching at his wounded foot.  Blood showed as it leaked from the hole in the boot.

Feather turned and slammed an elbow into George’s ear before he could react.  The deputy fell at the unexpected blow.  He struggled to get up for a moment, coming briefly to all fours before collapsing back to the dust with a groan.  Feather bent to pick up the gun belt with one hand and darted towards the horses.  One, his, nickered at his approach.

“Get him!” sheriff Thomas Gruff shouted.  “Don’t let him get away!”  His calls were almost lost, however, drowned out by Sam's shrieks of agony.  That’s one that won’t be chasing me or anyone else for a while, Feather thought.

Feather pulled his mount away from the hitching post and vaulted up into the saddle.  He took a quick look back, watching as the sheriff released his grip on Jasper and went for his gun.  Feather thumbed back the hammer and fired.  The bullet slapped the earth beside Gruff’s foot.  It tore the spur on that boot away with a whining ricochet.

Pure luck, Feather thought.  But maybe it’ll make him cautious.

It didn’t.  The sheriff rolled right, coughing as he inhaled a face full of dust.  He was still reaching for his gun, fumbling with it, when Feather fired a second time.  This bullet also missed the sheriff, as intended.  But it threw a cloud of dirt and road dust into his face, worsening the cough and partially blinding him.  Feather shouted and put his heels to his horse.  The mare whickered and galloped off into the night.



Feather came awake clutching for his gun.  His horse whickered nervously.  He sat up, blinking stupidly at the first hints of dawn.  Somewhere in the distance a coyote repeated its barking howl.  He twitched at the sound, kicking out with one leg as he struggled to stand.  His grunts of effort turned into a hiss as the leg swished through the coals of the fire—it had gone out hours before, but was still hot enough to sting.  He stood, wobbling only slightly, the gun out.

Guilt’s a powerful notion, Feather thought.  I can’t just leave him there.  Sure, killing the girl was unfortunate.  But Jasper had only been defending himself.  Wasn’t his fault the girl got in the way.  ‘Twas hers once she saw the boy going for the rifle.  Damn it, if they’d give him a trial.  But, no that wouldn’t help either.  Not with the judge so powerful attached to the girl, either.  “Gonna have to take care of this myself,” Feather said.  Just voicing the thought drove it home to him.  Yep, guilt is a powerful thing.

It had been a bit more than two days since he’d left town.  He knew from long experience that it would take them a couple more to get the scaffold erected.  Four days, maybe five.  Probably five.  And five was a Sunday.  They’d never hang someone on a Sunday.

So, he thought, a day to plan.  Two days and change to get back.  And an evening to bust Jasper loose.  It wouldn’t be the first time Feather had done so.  Likely wouldn’t be the last, neither.  Resigned, Feather reached for his saddlebags.  Breakfast came first.  Coffee before that.  His canteen gurgled as he poured water into his cup and began the morning ritual.

About whom I hadn't thought of in a while
Busy bees bustling streets
Nestled in the hives of life

Will we say hello? Perhaps get coffee together again
Or will it be the same
Spoken promises voided in the realm 

When does the performance end
Where does the me begin 
The distinction is getting blurrier by the day
Is that what brought you out again

Usually there's a positive note
Uplifting us at the end of this
But doing that feel wrong now
As the days go by amiss

I hope we meet again 
Perhaps in a better part of life 
I'll keep clinging onto the light 
Perhaps I'll keep my promises this time

I want to build a community of like-minded artists, starting with just two people. So, if you fit the vibe, slide into my DMs with a weird hello note.

You might be the right fit if you’re:

	•	Currently not working (fully diving into turning passion into work)
	•	Obsessed with stories

	•	Not a people pleaser
	•	Someone who keeps going even when stuck
	•	Bonus points if you love stationery, coffee, clouds and moon 🍒

I want to connect with people who get the creative struggle- the unknowns, the ups and downs- and who want to build discipline and accountability together.

A community where we can rant, spark ideas, and create something weird, spooky, and happy.

How do I move forward?,"I’m about 9 months into a new job. This was a big career transition for me and it’s a complex corporate environment - it’s also a global company, so that is a whole other layer to navigate! 

I’m feeling a bit down today because this week, I had coffee with a colleague in a different department and the aftermath has been unhelpful. I’m trying to get to know other people in the company as I work with the same few people and I tend to be on the shyer side. I’ve been pushing myself to make more connections.

There was one girl I met at an event months ago and I reached out to her for coffee to talk about her experience in the company and to better understand how our functions have worked together in the past. I work on the finance team and she does something in partnerships. 

I know there have been some questions about the future of the department she’s in (their function was on the chopping block at one point). We talked for about an hour about all sorts of things and, at one point, she was fishing a bit about the future of her function and what I had heard. I do know that her function is precarious but I’m not dumb enough to say that. So I played it off and said oh yeah, I had heard that in the past (which is no secret) but that at this point that wasn’t on the table, I hadn’t heard anything recently, etc. The one thing I did say that was a mistake was that at one point (years ago) her function was being considered to be absorbed by a different department - I only know this because the head of her department told me. I thought this was common knowledge but she told me she has never heard that.

Literally less than 24 hours later, my manager called me and said this girl had told her manager what I said but completely exaggerated it. She claimed I said their function was going to be cut and a bunch of other stuff I never said. I was honestly shocked and told her what I actually had said. My manager wasn’t necessarily mad, but gently told me to be careful what I say, etc etc. 

I feel so embarrassed about the whole thing and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it this evening. Does this whole department hate me now? My manager must think I have bad judgment or must not trust me - and I generally consider myself a discrete person. It just constantly feels like every time I open my mouth I have to think about every little thing I say. 

I guess I’m just looking for some advice and feedback on whether this ever gets better lol. I’m still learning how to navigate this place but I felt like today was a setback. ",3,1741834858.0,careerguidance,6,0.8,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

When Augustus McCrae came to, it was to the sound of knickering and a cold, hard breeze. The fire was reduced to a smoldering heap. His horse–eyes illuminated by the last embers–gazed past the bend that concealed the cave exit.

“What is it, Nobu?” Augustus asked, placing a hand on his coal-coated stead.

Rather than answer, Nobu held his stare. Not for the first time in the last five years, Nobu showed why he was different. When faced with the unknown, most animals give in to fear or intrigue. Nobu embraced both, approaching situations like a human. It was that balance between curiosity and caution that had saved Augustus many times.

Augustus grumbled to his feet, rubbing the sleep off his eyes and shaking the soreness out of his legs. He was no stranger to hard travel, but eleven days without seeing a bed or a soul was pushing it, even for him. His back groaned at the thought of the days still ahead. All this for a face he could barely recall.

It was ironic that he spent more time thinking of Aki since they split than when they were together. Every morning, Augustus would sit with his coffee, put himself in the man’s mind, and plan his routes accordingly. Every town he reached, he’d scan the papers—half terrified, half hopeful–searching for some sign. When he felt tired, Aki shook him. When it hurt, Aki numbed him. When he wanted to give up, Aki picked him back up.

And yet, his old master’s face had faded to an outline. In his dreams, Aki told him stories with his deep, baritone voice. His coarse hands waved along as if playing conductor to the tale. In his nightmares, Aki’s eyes-and only his eyes-glared at Augustus through the dark. It was that look from their final encounter. Sometimes, it scorched its way into Augustus’ waking moments.

When Augustus turned the bend, he was greeted with the bitter cold. The wind tore fresh snow from the valley and stifled the night sky with curtains of white. The crescent moon shuffled from cloud to cloud, piercing the powder with a yellow haze. The haze dimly illuminated the surrounding mountain peaks–and the bear standing atop one.

Seeing a grizzly didn’t surprise Augustus. It was the mountains, after all. He was concerned, however, by the bear’s fixation. Surprise, intimidation, proximity to their young–these were the things that provoked a bear. Augustus had taken part in none of them, yet the bear was inching down the mountain toward him.

Augustus contemplated what to do. His gut–and Nobu’s instinct—told him something was off with that bear. He could stand his ground; he had faced worse things in the past. But that was also the past. His rust might bleed through, especially when his only options were a cramped cave or the blinding outdoors.

Anybody would have done better than me with their tongue on anesthesia with 3 shots of vodka.

I have my sixth interview coming up, and I have been very nervous about what to do. Do I wear formal, like a suit to a coffee shop?? I don't wanna look like those people who wear suits to a class presentation, but it's legit the only nice pairs of clothings I have.

Like if it was a formal job interview I would at least expect what to happen, but this is more like ""talking more about opportunity"" type thing, so I'm very lost.

1ja29nb,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ja29nb/i_finally_broke_down_16_months_in_and_im/,I finally broke down 16 months in. And I'm essentially right back where I started.,"My living hell started when I worked for a bunch of sociopaths doing marketing production on a 6-month contract from May-November in 2023. I told myself, huh, I've been at 2 entertainment giants now, shouldn't be too hard to find a new role.

I have been on over 50 interviews. All of which have resulted in nothing. I was approaching a year of full unemployment when I finally managed to pick up a part time role in the fall, which is still a net loss for me month by month financially speaking.

I've been fucked over in so many different ways I can't even count anymore. Any unethical HR scenario you can think of, it's happened to me. But today out of all the endless days truly broke me. 

I was told after a final interview with a tech company I'd speak to their CMO in a coffee chat. I eventually get green lighted for the zoom. Any rational human would think it's just a sanity check call before giving the final blessing, right?

Instead they lied to me. That was their ""final round"". Although I kind of saw it coming (still kept myself 100% professional, suit, treated it like any final interview, etc.), why the fuck would they say it's just a coffee chat if they're going to pull out a unicorn candidate on me and slam the door? 

But what's really making me break down right now? I'm now forced to take the option I was praying I wouldn't have to: yet another contract role at yet another network doing the same work I did previously. No job security, no benefits. Not to mention the fact I applied and interviewed for it with it being a full time role, but they bait and switched it into a contract for ""organizational purposes"" when they gave me this pathetic offer. I'll be back to where I was 16 months ago, just at a different building under a new logo.

I cried for the first time in 3 years. Kicked my bedroom door through and ripped it off the hinges.

I just want to wake up from this nightmare.

1ja29fr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ja29fr,I’m at my wits end!! Any opinions are appreciated,"For the last few months (maybe 6months) I’ve had acne along my jaw line/cheeks that are pretty treatment resistant. They’ll come and go but they always come back with a vengeance. I researched about fungal and hormonal acne (which I believe it’s a combo of) and learned about using non-comedogenic products. This was two months ago, and since switching my products the flares have gone but again, they keep coming back. 

My current routine is (with the goal of simply trying to soothe my skin):
AM — wash face with water, Anua heartleaf 77% soothing toner, beauty of Joseon glow deep serum, anua 7+ rice ceramide serum, and haruharu black rice 10 moisturizer unscented version. If the UV index is 2+ I wear elta MS tinted sunscreen (it’s winter where I am)
PM — wash my face with Anua heartleaf succinic moisturizing cleansing foam and the rest is the same. If my skin is really dry the last step in my routine is abib rice probiotics overnight mask

I do think these products really help with the post hyperpigmentation from the acne and I really love my routine but this damn acne is driving me nuts. 

A few things to note, I am on a lot of medication (I suffer from chronic illness), so maybe that’s contributing? My diet is pretty clean, I don’t really have a lot of sugar or processed foods in my diet but the occasional cookie every once in a while. I hydrate well, at least 2 24oz bottles a day. I drink coffee and/or matcha in the morning. I change my pillow case every few days. The acne is also itchy and painful which makes me think it’s fungal acne. I also think some of it is hormonal because it comes back in my luteal phase (I’m in luteal right now 😭) And some of the acne is under the skin, never breaks the surface - they’re so painful and they’ll go away then come back a few weeks later in the same area. I haven’t seen a dermatologist yet but I plan to ask my doctor for a referral at my appt next week.

1ja24cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ja24cz/im_suffering/,I'm suffering.,"It's been 5 years since Ive been actively on Reddit. 

I tried to take my life and survived, I realised a lot because of that left an abusive relationship where I also pressed charges, alone. Finding out years later that I was offered support,I never recieved the letter of support from victim justice support because they sent it to my offenders parents address (where I was not living during or after relationship). 
Getting free legal advice on how to fill out a form needed to respond for court, waiting two weeks for ""do the best you can"". The document was rejected because I obviously didn't fill it out correctly instead I had to bargain with my abusers parents/who were petitioning on his behalf. 

My best friend/sister who took her life because she could never get the help she wanted. 

I was diagnosed with bipolar while I was in the relationship with my ex. no medications worked and I always questioned it. It has been used against me in every way. I took my child to the emergency room, where they tried to admit me once seeing the bipolar word in my file and that I wasn't on medication. The doctor gave me a verbal beatdown that my children were not safe with me, I was a danger to them. I had to fight to talk to a psychiatrist, who agreed with me that I wasn't mentally ill and said to discharge me. While I was talking to the psychiatrist, they asked my friend who drove me to the hospital to video call my oldest child (who was at home with my sister) to ""check if she's real"" 
They lied in their reports, they wrote my information and history disgustingly incorrect (example says my child's father is my brother which is grossly false, the child's father of a different name who is definitely NOT related to me, was in the emergency room with me telling the doctor his information). I had to fight our version of CPS for months, all of them saying how dangerous it is to not be on ""my"" medication - medications I havent been on in three years. A public health system psychiatrist said they believed that diagnosis to be incorrect - but it wasn't in her power to change it. All my ""emotional outbursts and mood swings"" came because of something triggering it, it's not in my head, there's never not a reason. Something happened right now or just did that I'm reacting to and the public psychiatrist agreed. Someone probably won't see that in a 1 hour video call appointment - which is all it took to diagnose bipolar. No where in my history was I hospitalised for a bipolar episode except after when I called the police on my dv ex during an event. he cried to the police I was bipolar and not on medication (which was because I tried to overdose after finding out he was assaulting me while I was knocked out from these meds). I was released within hours. The polices 10 years in medical experience really showed there as I wasn't meant to be there.

My counsellor of two years was leaving the service. Ive struggled since then. Ive engaged in services that couldn't help because I wasn't in the right area. I got in touch with one in the right area, because I'm in regional/farmland/rural areas they referred me to a drug and alcohol service to help in transport and other support services and referrals. I was hesitant,as so far any addiction issues Ive had, Ive been able to recover from or completely cut down (cigarettes I went from 50grams a week to 3 cigarettes a day if I'm lucky. 10 double shot coffees a day to four at the most. deleted social medias to limit screen addiction, no longer do illicit drugs/which ended with ex, and I only have 2-3 alcoholic beverages in a month) Shed said it wasn't for addiction purposes and she'd continue our sessions. Ive not heard from her. Ive been diagnosed with ""PTSD with a complex history"" for over 10 years now. The drug and alcohol counsellor was .. probably your typical one. the whole ""just get up and do it, get it over and done with. Its easy I do it everyday"" sometimes life feels too overwhelming and to be honest it's completely disheartening constantly being reminded how 'easy' it is for so many other people. I began to break down on that phone call, about how I felt and have felt about being a mother and a person since that hospital visit. She told me to have compassion for the emergency room doctor. I understand that and fair enough but even I know you don't battle an emotional breakdown with logic. So I haven't spoken to a counsellor since.

I just got the run around from our child support agency, found out that the assessment is basically bullshit because the assessment basically just lays out how much child support he can pay, $40 a month, which is then delegated to all dependants, so I'm not entitled to $40 a month like written on the assessment - but that's not how it's written, the assessment doesn't say that in any way.

I had a dv support worker for a couple months, who was trying to get me into the police to report all the other crimes against me by my ex like that I was a minor when it all started and everything in between. Ive not heard a single thing from any of them since the conversation. 

I used to chase up supports, complain, leave feedback etc. 
Now, I know there's nothing I can do about any of this physically. I just have to have compassion that even the people Ive known with bipolar haven't been singled out like that yet. 
I feel like they see that my mum and brother who were/are schizophrenics, and just assume I'm a fucking nut case. I can't lie about it, because it's all in my medical records. 

I don't understand why I have to fight so hard to say I'm not mentally ill, just too traumatised to live a functional, fullfilling life.
There is no advocacy for those also in my shoes. 
We're supposed to be one of the best country's, but there's so many flaws in our public support or health systems but paying privately is no better.

1ja23h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MAFS_AU/comments/1ja23h7/the_lasses_from_a_blokes_point_of_view/,The lasses from a blokes point of view.,"I've noticed some opinions floating around about the girls of this show, and some of them have surprised me. However, I remember then that most of the audience are women, and they're viewing it from a totally different perspective than an XY-wielder would, probably. Obviously, the show has villain/hero edits, producer influence and your views might differ, so take what I say as just one mans opion on the tyre-fire of this series that I continue to watch out of morbid curiosity.

So I'm just gunna throw this out there: what are the girls like for my male brain, and which would I consider myself lucky to be paired with?

Lauren: Horrible, vinegear-faced dog. She's a snakey, pretentious gold-digging Temu Hyacinth Bucket without the oddly-endearing charm or comedic timing. I'd wish this chick on a bloke only if I hated him. Smile, nod and avoid at all costs.

Veronica: She's easy on the eyes, I'll give her that, but the way she's treated Eliot shows me she's a nasty, mean-girl sociopath. That she cuckquened Jamie makes her even worse. If Disney wanted to cast an Evil Queen for its next Snow White remake, they got their girl right here. (even looks like a younger version too)

Morena: Run away. I have big sympathy for someone in her position who got out of an abusive relationship and worked on themselves, and I doubt it's easy to date as a woman in your 50s (the ones I know gave up and just became cougars prowling the bars for horny 18 year olds) but her 100-mile-and-hour personality type is way too full on and over the top for me.

Awhina: She's a sweet-heart, and I lost count of the amount of times I yelled at the TV for her to ditch that Jim's DV mascot Adrian creep. She's a bit naive in areas, and I think she is currently mistaking lust/infatuation with genuine care and love with Adrian, but she has a good heart that I fear people will use to their advantage. As someone who took years to get out of an emotionally abusive relationship, I understand how you're always lying to yourself that your partner will change, things will get better, and I worry Awhina will get stuck in that for good.

Jaimie: She has her flaws, but she has an endearing sincerity that we've come to appreciate, even if it leads her to making poor social argument choices. I don't think I could handle her as a partner, she's too loud and full on for me, but I could appreciate her in a friendship circle.

Jaqui: This is one nutty broad, but she's kinda hilarious. I don't see her as mean or nasty like Veronica or Lauren, she's just a bit mad, and how she came to Jamie's defence was rather sweet. I could definitely see myself being friends with her at work, where there'd never be a dull moment, but her presence in my life being small, healthy doses.

Carina: I want to like Carina, and the idea of them bringing on a more traditional Catholic girl who wanted to be a great and supportive partner for her hubby in this show could have been a really interesting modern foil. But traditional girls dont brag about being groupies for rappers. But that's fine, that's her prior business, but even in the show she's started off really naive, she's been waaaay too forgiving of Paul when he punched a door, but him revealing what she said about Cleos sister is what breaks her trust? I dunno. She has her qualities, but not the girl I'd go for. Paul has really revealed himself to be a slimy, manipulative rat though.

Beth: I like Beth. She's been a quieter cast member compared to others, but I liked how direct she was with Ryan, but not in a I-want-to-start-a-fight-then-play-victim like Veronica. She's like Jaimie on a Tylenol. Imo, she's a good looking lass too. 

Rhi: People kinda rag on Rhi a bit for being boring, or her drama with Jaqui over some texting crap that flew over my head. Honestly, from a guys perspective, I don't see it, Rhi is a pretty even-headed, good looking woman that's been a good partner with Jeff, is it?, and if that recent dinner party yellow dress is any indication, she does not skip lunges and squats day at the gym. For some thinking she can be fake nice or a bit bitchy to other girls on the show, sure, I'm not saying that's illegitimate (a big red flag while dating is how your date treats the wait staff, for example), but from a guys perspective, ehhh, she's a great package and catch, and Jeff's happiness is testimony to that. Honestly, people rag on Rhi and Jeff for being boring and stale, but to me it's leagues ahead being stable and a touch boring, than drama-filled, abusive, toxic or built on lies like other relationships on the show.



Conclusion: imo, the best three girls on the show, from my man-brain perspective, would be Awhina, Rhi and Beth. If I had the choice of taking any of the girls out for a coffee and seeing if the chemistry was there, it'd be one of those three.

Jaimie and Jaqui I could see having as friends, in small doses. 

Carina, has her pros and cons, wish her the best, but not for me.

Morena, I hope you find what you're looking for as long as it's nowhere near me.

Lauren and Veronica: They can take their place guarding the entrance to the underworld.

Thanks for reading, I hope you have a blessed day.

1ja23aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1ja23aj/passed_step_1_us_img_if_i_can_do_it_anybody_can/,"Passed step 1!! US img. If i can do it, anybody can!","US IMG and I PASSED TODAY!! To preface this, i’m the most average student ever. I had the luxury of time which i know US students probably don’t, but here’s my take. This community has helped in many ways and it’s also really stressed me out for no reason as well, so I’m here to set it straight. No BS. 
1) PLEASE DO NOT listen to these fear mongering people. No you do not need an 80+ on your nbmes and free 120 to go in. Will it be nice if you did? Yes. But trustttt your nbme scores when they say that a 65% is a 97% chance of passing or something. Truly in the 2 week wait for my result, that’s all that kept me going. 
2) THE EXAM IS DOABLE!!! And VERY similar to nbme and free 120 concepts. Dont believe anybody that says otherwise, cuz wtf else are they gonna test you on?! I’m not sure if i’m supposed to say this but i did actually get a few extremely similar repeat questions from previous free 120s. Imagine it’s free 120 style questions but longer stems, testing nbme concepts, +/- easier straightforward questions. Ethics ethics ethics was huge, probably 5-6 questions per block which imo saved me lol, but they were very doable. Extremely similar to amboss ethics, so make sure you do that atleast once. 
MEHLMAN WAS MY LIFE SAVER!!! i did all of his documents cuz again, US img with a lot of time. I finished uworld, i finished reading FA and needed a quick conceptual resource to put everything together that i already know, his documents are chefs kiss. I read over them mostly, but did arrows, neuroanatomy, msk, and endo twice since those are my weakest. 
ANOTHER THING: The biggest thing to remember is that sometimes, on the real deal, the answer is straight forward. either you know it or you don’t. They’re not trying to trick you like uworld, they’re just trying to test if you know your stuff or not. If you can do uworld, if you can get 60s on your nbmes, and 2 consecutive 65s to be safe, GO IN!!!! Shoot for 70s if you want but i think 2 consecutive 65+ is a golden mark. 
Honestly i found the question styles to be alot easier and more doable than Uworld. The only complaint I have for this test was that the stems were extremely long and it felt like i ran out of time/ didn’t have enough time to review my flagged questions here and there, but just trust your gut, that’s ok. The only other hard thing is keeping up your stamina and being able to concentrate for 7 hours, but just keep going. bring coffee, lunch, and hydrate yourself well. Eat a good breakfast that way you aren’t hungry and get sleep the night before. ITS JUST A TEST AND IM SO OVER EVERYONE ON HERE FEAR MONGERING!!!
3) Experimentals were somewhat obvious to me atleast??, i’ve been doing this for so long i could sorttttt of tell which one was like ok wtf, and some others i couldn’t tell, but don’t get too crazy about them. anything i didn’t know, i just trained my brain to say it was experimental and doesn’t count and moved on. 
4)i’m leaving my stats below and i can answer questions if anybody needs. but for now, goodbye and good riddance to step 1, and step 2 here i come. 

NBME 26 (baseline)- taken in september- 56%
NBME 27- also taken sometime in october- 57% 
NBME 28- on 11/12- 49% (this one crushed me cuz i had been studying and doing uworld for so long, but i got up and didnt let this stop me. This was like a knife in my back, it was awful)
NBME 25- on 11/19- 65% (feeling hopeful here, my studying was paying off and maybe nbme 28 just sucks ass)
NBME 29- on 12/6- 60% 
NBME 30- on 12/11- 60% (felt sad here cuz i feel like i plateaued even though i didn’t know what more i could do. It’s at this point i took a bit of a 2 week mental health break lol)
Came back, studied hard again and used amboss for new questions and THAT really helped me get comfortable with questions. I also would just speed review all my previous nbmes again to the point where i became an nbme concept MACHINE. I was motivated to just be DONE.
My Uworld avg when i finished it all was 49% lol
NBME 26 (retake)- 69% on 1/31 (i didn’t remember anything from the first time)
NBME 27 (retake)- 74% on 2/4. Felt like i entered a new dimension, but took it with a grain of salt since it was a retake. 
NBME 31- on 2/8 ( 3 weeks out)- 67%. Felt amazing. 
Just reviewed nbme concepts (i made an nbme concept notebook and it helped me sooo much. made very detailed notes, so that i can learn every angle in which nbme asks different things. This is the golden rule i felt i uncracked for the real deal. I felt like so many real deal concepts were straight from my notes. and kept doing amboss questions just to be in the habit of new questions, since i ran out of uworld questions to do and revised mehlman docs.)
new free 120- 75%, 5 days out. I couldn’t believe my screen. Didn’t think i was capable of having a 7 in front of my score.
old free 120- 72%, 2 days out
took it 2/25 AND I PASSED!!!!! 

I am in no way shape or form those people that cry over 70s and ask if i’m ready. getting my 70s took me literal months, and a LOT of blood sweat and tears and uncertainty. but again, i had the luxury of time which i understand a lot of others esp in the US do not. Completely avg student, overprepared myself and walked out of the exam feeling very neutral. 
HOPE THIS HELPED AND GOOD LUCK. 
DO NOT LISTEN TO FEAR MONGERING, REMMEBER EXAM IS DOABLE!!!!

Part 1

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is the most common form of systemic Mast Cell Disease and is known to cause Dysautonomia in some but not all patients.

A histamine dump happens when your body produces too much histamine that builds up in the brain. Histamine dumps often happen late at night or early in the morning. You might suddenly feel changes in body temperature, itchiness, or blood pressure changes as your histamine levels rise.

Histamine, serotonin, and dopamine are all neurotransmitters that play a role in regulating sleep-wake cycles and helping the brain transition from sleep to wakefulness. 

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS):                           
MCAS is an immunological condition in which mast cells, a type of white blood cell, inappropriately and excessively release chemical mediators, such as histamine, resulting in a range of chronic symptoms, sometimes including anaphylaxis or near-anaphylaxis attacks. Primary symptoms include cardiovascular, dermatological, gastrointestinal, neurological, and respiratory problems.

[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome](https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-treatments/related-conditions/mcas)

>H1 and H2 histamine receptors are two main classes of histamine receptors that are involved in many different bodily functions:                                             

>●H1 histamine receptors.                                                   
These receptors are found in many tissues, including immune cells, smooth muscle, and endothelium. They play a role in regulating vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and atrial muscle contractility. H1 receptors are also involved in cellular migration and nociception. Antihistamines that bind to H1 receptors are often used to treat allergies and allergic rhinitis, such as hives, itchy skin, itchy eyes, runny nose, and sneezing.  

>Commonly used H1 antagonists currently available in the United States are cetirizine, levocetirizine, desloratadine, loratadine, and fexofenadine.                                                   

>●H2 histamine receptors.                                                  
These receptors are mainly found in gastric parietal cells but are also present in vascular smooth muscle, neutrophils, suppressor T cells, the CNS, and the heart. H2 receptors are primarily involved in stimulating gastric acid secretion, which is closely linked to the development of peptic ulcers. H2 receptors also modify airway mucus production and vascular permeability. Antihistamines that bind to H2 receptors are often used to treat upper gastrointestinal conditions caused by excessive stomach acid, such as gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) and peptic ulcers. 

>Commonly used H2 antagonists currently available in the United States are cimetidine, famotidine
and nizatidine.

>Mast cell stabilizers are medications that can help treat a range of symptoms by limiting calcium flow across the mast cell membrane. This prevents the release of vasoactive substances and degranulation. 
Mast cell stabilizers are often prescribed in combination with histamine blockers. These medications include Cromolyn, Ketotifen, Lodoxamide, 
Nedocromil, Pemirolast, and Epinastine hydrochloride.

>Other medications used are included here:[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/mast-cell-activation-syndrome)

It may be a Histamine Intolerance (HI) instead or MCAS. Because histamine intolerance involves the mast cells, it is often confused with mast cell activation. The difference, however, is that with MCAS, mast cells secrete multiple mediators in addition to histamine—whereas in histamine intolerance, the mast cells release only histamines and nothing else.

If your Allergist is unable to perform the necessary tests, you may need a referral to an Immunologist.

Many people recommend an elimination diet or a low histamine diet. 

[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome and Diet](https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthfacts/8114)

Diamine oxidase (DAO) is an enzyme that breaks down histamine in the gut, and DAO supplements may help with symptoms of histamine intolerance. 

When using DAO, it is important to first lower the histamine levels. Therefore, we recommend following a low-histamine diet for at least two weeks before starting DAO. After these two weeks, you can begin taking DAO three times a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) while still following a low-histamine diet.

Diamine oxidase is an enzyme that helps break down excess histamine in your body. More research is needed to establish effectiveness and dosage, though current studies report no adverse effects.

I would research H1 and H2 histamine blockers. There are plenty that are available over the counter. It's recommended to take double the normal dose, one dose of each antihistamine, morning and evening. Many people have recommended cetirizine or Xyzol for H1 and famotidine for H2. 

My symptoms didn't completely line up with MCAS initially. My symptoms have continued to get worse with dry, itchy, watery, and goopy eyes and reactions to certain foods after eating. I started drinking my favorite hazelnut coffee I haven't had in nine months because I switched brands. Now I'm having MCAS symptoms. I'm itchy, sneezing, and have a runny nose after eating or drinking things that don't agree with me. I'm allergic to the fillers in my thyroid medication.

I was taking Cetirizine for H1 and Famotidine for H2. One dose of each morning and evening. It caused worsening tachycardia and adrenaline or histamine dumps. I was also extremely nauseous. That never happened before. I switched to taking one dose of each Cetirizine and Famotidine in the morning only.

I learned that in some people, MCAS symptoms are too severe that OTC medications don't work. And/or we're allergic to the fillers in the OTCs. That's what happened to me. I was prescribed Ketotifen and Fluticasone for MCAS recently.

>Some individuals who contract COVID-19 are experiencing symptoms like extreme fatigue, brain fog, chest pain and palpitations, shortness of breath, headaches, sleep disruptions, GI issues, and even rashes that continue on for weeks after the initial COVID-19 infection has cleared up - and in many cases these are even lasting for months, or years. These symptoms tend to also worsen after any sort of physical or mental exertion. The medical community has termed this “Long-COVID” or “COVID Long-Hauler Syndrome.” In fact, a surprising rate of about 30% of COVID-19 patients experiences these long-term symptoms after the initial COVID infection. It also resembles the symptom list of those living with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS).

>The prevalence of MCAS is similar to that of severe cases within the Covid-19-infected population. Much of Covid-19’s hyperinflammation is concordant with manners of inflammation which MC activation can drive. Drugs with activity against MCs or their mediators have preliminarily been observed to be helpful in Covid-19 patients. None of the authors’ treated MCAS patients with Covid-19 suffered severe infection, let alone mortality.

[Covid-19 hyperinflammation and post-Covid-19 illness may be rooted in mast cell activation syndrome](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7529115)

>Studies are now suggesting that there is a connection between long haulers and MCAS, finding that the symptoms of long haulers occur because the COVID-19 virus actually triggers mast cells to activate (MCAS) and the subsequent cytokine storms. “Long COVID’ describes post-COVID-19 syndrome when symptoms persist for more than 12 weeks after initial infection with no alternative diagnosis. Both mast cell activation syndrome and long COVID cause multiple symptoms. It is theorized that COVID-19 infection could lead to exaggeration of existing undiagnosed mast cell activation syndrome, or could activate normal mast cells owing to the persistence of viral particles.”

Part 2

>What are the symptoms of MCAS? 
Patients who suffer from MCAS may experience symptoms in 2 or more organ systems and may mistake physical symptoms for other conditions. In the gastrointestinal tract, symptoms may include diarrhea, constipation, general abdominal discomfort, GERD, bloating/distension and cramping. Neurologic MCAS symptoms may mimic other conditions and appear as OCD-like thoughts and behaviors, mood swings, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fatigue. Some people who suffer from MCAS experience more typical allergy-like symptoms including wheezing, rashes, hives, skin flushing/itching, and sinusitis. Other skin conditions like cysts, cystic acne, and edema are also common occurrences. Reactions to heat, altitude, alcohol, artificial dyes/additives and certain environmental allergens like pollen and mold all fit under the MCAS umbrella of symptoms. Reproductive system conditions like unusual menstrual cycles and endometriosis; fibromyalgia-like joint pain; and blood pressure/heart-rate dysregulation are all possible symptoms as well. Indeed, MCAS can and does exist alongside other common conditions like IBS, mood disorders, SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth), POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) and others, making diagnosis complex.

Have you considered Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)?       
                                                                        
●Your allergist/Immunologist can diagnose Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) by considering a patient's symptom history, physical exam, and lab tests. A diagnosis is appropriate if symptoms are recurrent, accompanied by increased mast cell-derived chemical mediators, and responsive to treatment. 

●Blood or urine tests.                                                 
These tests can measure mast cell mediators, such as tryptase, histamine, or prostaglandins, which increase during an episode. However, tryptase levels can be elevated in other conditions, so levels alone don't indicate MCAS. A patient should be tested multiple times, both when feeling well and during an episode.                                                                      

●Other factors that may be considered include:              
○An allergy skin test or allergy blood tests to rule out other causes of symptoms.                                          
○A trial of treatment using inhibitors of mast cell mediators, such as antihistamines or other drugs that block chemicals released by mast cells.

This stabilizer is about 2,500 times more effective than cromolyn at preventing histamine release in some animal models. It is available as eye drops, which are FDA approved for children 2 years and older with vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). 

>●Pemirolast.                                                                        
This stabilizer is available as eye drops, which are FDA approved for children 3 years and older with allergic conjunctivitis. 

>●Nedocromil.                                                                         
This stabilizer is available as an inhalation, which is approved for children 12 years and older, but is sometimes used off-label for younger children. It is also available as eye drops, which are FDA approved for children 3 years and older with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. 

>●Ketotifen.                                                                           
This stabilizer can be taken orally to treat general mast cell symptoms, including chronic idiopathic urticaria, due to its antipruritic properties. 

>●Epinastine hydrochloride.                                                   
This stabilizer is also an antihistamine. 

Some medications that can trigger Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) symptoms include: 
opioids, antibiotics, NSAIDs, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, alcohol-containing medicines, intravenous vancomycin, neuromuscular junction blocking agents, 
and local anesthetics. 

There is no cure for MCAS, but treatments can help manage symptoms. These include avoiding triggers, taking medications that block chemicals released by mast cells, managing stress levels, speaking with a mental health professional, and having self-injectable epinephrine at all times. 

If your Allergist is unable to perform the necessary tests, you may need a referral to an Immunologist.

I would research H1 and H2 histamine blockers. There are plenty that are available over the counter. It's recommended to take double the normal dose. Split these dosages to morning and evening. Many people have recommended cetirizine or Xyzol for H1 and famotidine for H2.

My symptoms didn't completely line up with MCAS either. My symptoms have continued to get worse with dry, itchy, and watery eyes and reactions to certain foods after eating. I started drinking my favorite hazelnut coffee i haven't had in nine months because I switched brands. Now I'm having MCAS symptoms. I'm itchy, sneezing, and have a runny nose after eating or drinking things that don't agree with me. I'm allergic to the fillers in my thyroid medication.
I started the MCAS protocol. I'm taking Cetirizine for H1 and Famotidine for H2. Morning and night. It worsened my tachycardia and Dysautonomia symptoms. I took one dose per day. I had to stop. I take Fluticasone and Hydroxyzine for MCAS now. Omeprazole for Gerd (it's a PPI that also acts as a mast cell stabilizer). ",1,1741833436.0,u_SophiaShay7,0,1.0,False

TLDR:
- ADO bus from Cancun or Tulum airport is the best value for money way to get to Tulum. Super comfortable and only 430$ per person. 

- Taxis are super expensive so rent a scooter (if you have experience riding one). Just be super careful as roads are full of potholes and drivers don’t follow rules. 

- Delek and Akiin are two free cover beach clubs that I went to with decently priced drinks. Akiin has a minimum spend of 1000 pesos thought. 

- Don’t feel pressured to go to a beach club. You can easily walk through a beach club and lay on the beach. 

- Imo, Akumal is kind of a tourist trap. You pay 540$ for them to swim you out to a protected area for turtles where you will see 3 or 4 of them. If you’ve never seen sea turtles before, do it… otherwise skip it. 

- People talk about being scammed or ripped off but honesty I never experienced any of this. If you are street smart and do your research, you should be completely fine.

- There are so many cenotes to choose from! If you want a chill, quiet, off the beaten path cenote.. i’d recommend Cenote Santa Cruz. 200$ per person. 

- Best thing you can do is stop by the super market and grab a bunch of snacks and cold drinks, then head to the beach. 

- If you love nature and unique experiences, don’t miss out on a floating tour of Sian Ka’an reserve… it was the highlight of my trip. 

- La Palma central is a super cool spot to hang out at night. There is dancing, fun food trucks and artisanal craft sellers.

- If you want a change from Mexican food and want a good French breakfast spot, hit up La Fouree. They have amazing croissants and other French pastries and breads. 

As I am a huge foody and have a special place in my heart for Mexican cuisine, I ranked all the restaurants I tried during this trip:

Tulum Restaurant tier list:

1. Sabor de Mar - great seafood and outdoor atmosphere. 
2. Taqueria El Carboncito - Simple, cheap and most authentic vibe
3. Taqueria Honorio - Best tasting meat, especially pork. 
4. La Taque Tulum - Slightly more upscale taqueria with great cocktails and a good happy hour deal. 
5. Tacos Many’s Tulum - Taco truck with delicious burritos and tacos. 
6. Taqueria La Chiapaneca - Claimed by a local as the best taco joint in town. Fantastic tacos at a super fair price. 
7. El Camello Jr. - Decent spot for seafood 
8. Ricos Tacos ""La Chula"" - Decent taco food truck, cheap tacos. 
9. Los Morros Tulum - Overpriced “instagram” seafood, was not really impressed. They did have creative dishes but just no where near as tasty as the other spots. 

Trip review: 

I just got back from a week in Tulum and wanted to share my experience with you all. Sorry for this long post but I hope it will be helpful to give my perspective of Tulum for someone who wants to avoid the “instagram” superficial reputation that Tulum has. 
Before coming, I spent a lot of time doing research on the best way to experience Tulum without draining the bank account. I read a bunch of blog posts and reddit posts and as much as I found a lot of useful tips, I read a lot of negative stuff that stressed me out and made me slightly regret booking my trip. Although I held onto believing that Tulum will be as nice as you make it to be. So with that being said, this was my experience. 

We landed in Cancun and took an ADO bus from the airport to Tulum. We paid 430pesos pp for the bus tickets and I was super impressed by how comfortable it was. I’ve travelled a lot by bus in multiple countries and that was by far the most comfortable bus seat I experienced. There was AC and wifi (though I didn’t use the wifi so not sure how fast it was). We arrived in Tulum ADO central terminal 2.5hrs later and walked a few minutes to Taqueria La Chiapaneca. This taqueria had very good, cheap tacos in a simple restaurant with many locals (always a good sign). After eating 6 or 8 tacos, we paid around 160 pesos and went to find a taxi to go to the Airbnb (8min drive from the ADO terminal). I highly recommend walking a few minutes away from the bus terminal to grab a taxi as to not get ripped off. Also as many have said in this subreddit, taxis are notoriously expensive. We paid 300 pesos, which our airbnb host said was a fair price for 10min taxi ride. After settling in our airbnb, I went to rent a scooter at a nearby scooter rental. We rented from Moving scooter rental (movingrentalstulum.com) and had a great experience. You can message them and reserve a scooter through whatsapp (number on their website). They ask for a 20% deposit to make the reservation. We paid 500 pesos per day for a 150hp scooter and used that to get everywhere we needed. If you decide to rent a scooter, be super careful… roads have many very hard to see speed bumps and tons of gnarly huge pot holes. Also some drivers don’t really follow the rules of the road. Be super cautious and always wear a helmet. A full tank of gas cost like 80 pesos. We then took the scooter and went to the hotel zone to go to the beach. It is basically impossible to get beach access without walking through a beach club. If you don’t want to spend money at a beach club, don’t feel bad about walking through and finding a spot on the sand in-front of the beach club. All beaches in Mexico are public and so no one can bother you for laying out a towel and enjoying the beach. After a swim and some time on the beach we headed to dinner at El Camello Jr. which had amazing seafood dishes and super friendly staff.

The next day we went for breakfast at the famous Taqueria Honorio and ate pretty much all the different tacos on the menu but the best one was the cochinita pibil. At 10am this place was packed and had incredibly good tasting tacos. After eating more tacos than I care to admit, we took the scooter to Akumal to do some snorkelling. I wouldn’t recommend driving on the highways, the shoulder is quite narrow and drivers speed past you… it was sketchy and not for the feint of heart. As for Akumal, in my opinion, it’s kinda a tourist trap… as soon as we got there a bunch of snorkelling guides who tried to sell us the entrance to the beach and a 1hr tour for 540 pesos. We decided to just pay the official office 140 pesos per person to access the beach and the free swimming area (20m into the water). You can also get a free deposit for a locker (100 pesos deposit). Be sure to return the key by the time they close at 5pm. Once on the beach, it was very crowded and water visibility was not good. Maybe it was just that day. Once you paid the access to the beach, if you decide to do a snorkelling tour, there are many guides on the beach that will sell you a tour for a standard rate of 400pesos per person. When I asked a group of people what they thought of the tour, they said that you pay to basically see 3 or 4 turtles and that it was quite underwhelming if you have been snorkelling before. They basically swim you out from the shore to a restricted protected area where turtles swim. That evening we went to a slightly more upscale taqueria called La Taque Tulum in La Valeta. The food and margaritas were fantastic! Big portions too and cool decor. I had a bunch of tacos and a cheesy meat dish accompanied by flour tortillas from northern Mexico called LabNortenia (I think that’s how it’s spelled) and it was delicious. La Taque also has a happy hour where margaritas are buy 1 get 1 for 190 pesos. 

The next morning we went to cenote Santa Cruz. It was the perfect cenote experience I was looking for. Very low key and not touristy at all. We paid 200 pesos per person and the whole time we were there, there was only maybe 15 people and plenty of nice wooden sun chairs and pic nic tables. They have a washroom and shower and the open air cenote  is a big loop with many fish and a few turtles. The water was very turquoise and we brought masks and snorkels to enjoy such a good time. If you are looking for a quiet, relaxing cenote experience away from the hoard of tourists, this is the place for you. Only a 15 minute drive from Tulum. After spending the morning at the cenote, we went for lunch at Sabor de Mar. This was the best sea food experience I had in Tulum, we had tuna tartar and a variety of seafood tacos that were super fresh and exciting to eat. Their specialty seemed to be marlin but our favourite was the octopus taco. It is fully outdoor so perfect for a lunch on a sunny day! That afternoon we went to the hotel zone to a beach club called DELEK TULUM. We found parking nearby (on the side of the road where a guy popped up and asked us for 50 pesos to park there… much cheaper than the 100 pesos official parking areas. Delek doesn’t have cover and the drinks were reasonably priced for the hotel zone. We had a beer and a mojito for 500 pesos and spent the afternoon in their pool and on the beach. Their sun chairs are reserved for hotel guests during busy times but later in the afternoon they become available to outside guests. There is an area with bean bags that is available to outside guests but we never saw any available. That evening we went for dinner at Taqueria El Carboncito, the vibe felt the most local and super simple and cheap but the flavour of the meats was amazing! Since they cook the meat on charcoal, there is a slightly charred smokey taste that made them unique to other tacos we had tried. We were the only “gringos” there and really enjoyed the vibe. Families eating together and kids playing between the tables. The tacos were also super cheap, I think it was 20 pesos per taco. Definitely best quality value taco. 

The next day, we took it easy and went for lunch at Los Morros Tulum, which I had heard was a great seafood spot. They did have a variety of interesting and unique dishes but it was very over priced and quite salty. We paid 1300 pesos for a few nicely presented dishes that were kinda underwhelming. 

On the last full day in Tulum, we had booked a floating tour of Sian Ka’an with Sian Ka’an community tours and I was initially quite apprehensive that it would not be worth the 3000 pesos (per person). I was completely wrong, it ended up being an amazing experience. They picked us up at 6:30 from our airbnb and we stopped for breakfast (which was included)  before getting on the 6 person boat. The tour guide was super informative and friendly. We crossed Laguna de Muyil and Laguna Chunyaxché before getting off the boat to visit a Mayan temple. Afterwards we jumped into the water and floated down an ancient mayan canal quietly watching birds fly by and enjoying this unique way to immerse yourself in nature. It was very relaxing! The water was super clear and the current carried you through the mangroves. It was honestly the highlight of my whole Tulum trip. After the floating, we got back onto the boat and went to spot manatees. We saw a couple but only their nose and head pop out of the water. I was expecting to see them up close but they are very shy and the boat motor scares them. We then stopped at a beautiful beach for a quick swim and then headed back to Muyil. We finished the tour with a great lunch of traditional fish or chicken and then they dropped us back off at our airbnb at 2pm. We spent the rest of the afternoon at another beach club called Akiin Beach Tulum. It was also free cover but minimum spend of 1000 pesos. We decided to enjoy their beach beds and had a couple drinks. This beach club was not quite as busy as Delek and the music was a lot louder so kinda annoying. Between the two, I preferred Delek as their pool and atmosphere was much better. That evening we went to grab a couple tacos from Ricos Tacos ""La Chula"", which was a simple taco truck with Suadera and Surtida tacos which we didn’t see anywhere else. These were the cheapest tacos along with Taqueria El Carboncito. They were quite good but nothing to write home about. We then went to Palma Central for the live music salsa tuesdays. It’s a fantastic open air venue with a bunch of cool food trucks and artisanal craft sellers. The cover was 70pesos per person and that included a drink ticket. The music and overal vibe was so fun. We danced salsa and enjoyed some fire dancing performance then called it a night. 

On the last day after checking out of our airbnb, we returned the scooter and then took a cab to the ADO bus terminal. Since we had a few hours to kill, we decided to go have coffee and french pastries at La Fouree. I was starting to feel a bit tired of tacos, so a freshly baked croissant and baguette sandwhich was a nice change. They have an outdoor area in the back that is really comfortable and the staff is super friendly. We then took the bus back to Cancun to catch our flight. ",8,1741833382.0,tulum,1,1.0,False

At first I was pretty excited for the new opportunity, but after I met my coworkers, they all seem really nice but I noticed pretty much all of them look very young, like just graduated high school or are in their first few years of college. It’s not super surprising but I just feel like I stick out like a sore thumb. I do get told I look younger than my age so I’m not sure if any of them know or can tell how old I am, but I figure they’ll find out eventually and if I get asked by one of them obviously I’m not going to lie. I hate to admit this but I care way too much what others think of me and I’m worried that when they find out how old I actually am they’ll think I’m a loser or a weirdo for working at a place like that when I’m almost 30. I was just unhappy with my current job and thought this new company would align with my life more. I would definitely try to work a full time job at a more “adult job”, but right now I’m raising two kids and prefer to have a job with more flexibility so I can be home for them when they’re not at school since they’re not old enough to watch themselves. I’ve looked into remote jobs too but they seem so hard to get hired on for unless you have a degree (which I don’t have). 
So at least for now I have to keep doing this job I just got hired for. I should be grateful because at least I HAVE a job and it’s better than nothing, but I struggle with feeling like I’m so behind in life, because when I think about the people I went to high school with, most of them have legitimate careers now. Some are teachers, real estate agents, nurses, dietitians, etc.. I have no idea how I’m going to be able to see these people at my high school reunion and tell them I work at a fast food coffee place for a living. 
I’m not asking to be babied by anyone here but I would just like to know your opinions and if anyone can possibly relate to this..",1,1741833270.0,depression,4,1.0,False

Originally I was thinking split 6 days in Maui + 6 in Oahu; Maui being first so we can really chill at the beach, then getting more adventurous as the trip goes on. We’re flying out of Denver, so both have direct flight options if needed.

It’s soooo difficult to narrow down the islands though. It’ll be our first time there and it all looks incredible. I could also see us really enjoying the Big Island’s parks, volcanoes, and coffee plantations. Flying to/from Denver from here might be a little more difficult from a quick Google search. 

For those who have been to the islands, does 6 days/each split between 2 islands seem reasonable? I’ve read many say that anything less than 4 nights on an island leaves something to be desired. 

Then looking in October, is a certain time of month better than others? If you had to choose 2 islands of the 3, what would you choose? 

I’ll take any resort recs too! I love exploring the best of the best but could also see us splitting the trip with a really bougie place on the beach, and a slightly less bougie place somewhere gorgeous. ",1,1741833123.0,honeymoonplanning,2,1.0,False

Edit & Update: A point of clarification, that I should have included this in the original post. A lot of people have been commenting that someone may have broken into my house. My house WAS broken into during Hurricane Francine while I was out of town. Someone threw a brick through my front window and climbed in, but don’t have a video of THAT real-life nightmare because the power was out. My landlord was kind enough to put in a security system after that which has sensors on all the doors and windows and is scheduled to turn on automatically while I’m at work and at night. It also has a motion sensor in the living room that is so sensitive Bigs usually sets it off at least once a day just by jumping on or off the couch. Needless to say, it would be nearly impossible for someone to get in without me knowing. 

I’m happy to say, however, I feel the situation has a happy ending. I recently submitted the whole saga to a Paranormal show and will paste what I wrote there:

“A few days after the video, I woke up at 5:30 am, because that is the time that I’ve grown accustomed to Bigsby waking me up to pee and now wake up naturally at that time regardless (dog owners know what I’m talking about). He hadn’t yet woken up though, however, and as I laid there waiting for the inevitable stretch and lick, I heard a woman’s voice say very clear and very loud next to my bed, “Potties?” Again, this is a phrase and question I ask him ALL THE TIME. I even got the voice on my sleep app so I know it wasn’t a lucid dream.

Later that that day after I got home from work, I was getting ready to take Bigs out for his daily evening walk. It had been cold recently so I had been wearing my gloves on our walks that I usually kept with his leash. This night, however, they were nowhere to be found. I checked every room and finally had to do without. The next morning, however, when I came out to make my coffee, the very first thing I noticed were my gloves sitting on the middle of my couch. They were in such an obvious place that I KNEW I would have seen them the night before at some point if they’d been there the whole time. Again, it gave me chills.

My theory is that Bigsby actually somehow manifested this ghost. All this happened a couple days after he had surgery to remove a growth from his eyelid. He had a very bad reaction to the narcotics they gave him during the surgery. He developed dysphoria as a side effect, meaning for the next 16 hours he had extreme anxiety and confusion, not knowing where he was or what was happening. He normally cuddles in bed with me, but that night he refused to stay in bed with me, instead ran from his bed in my bedroom to the couch in the living room every five minutes, ALL NIGHT LONG, never sleeping. As a pet owner, it was extremely distressing to see him so distressed. After this series of events, I now believe that his suffering somehow awoke an intelligent energy in my apartment who wanted to help take care of him, and did so by mimicking my words of comfort and our routines. I believe that the ghost found my gloves and moved them some place obvious because it wanted me to have them for our next evening's walk. Now he’s healed and healthy and back to his normal self, and we haven’t had any strange occurrences since. All this was very disconcerting at the time but never scary and it actually gives me comfort thinking we have some kind of guardian angel who loves my dog as much as I do. To be fair, he is a very adorable dog and I’m not surprised that his cuteness would wake someone from the dead.”",17,1741833089.0,Paranormal,8,0.84,False

1ja1sb0,https://i.redd.it/ekr59ewcbdoe1.png,My updated collection. All blind buys.,"Just updated my collection and here to review my latest additions. Last two reviews are of feminine fragrances.

Star Men Nebula is the cheapest one I own and surprisingly impressive. It reminds me of camphor, malt, earthy incense, booze and wood. Really nice evening fragrance. Lasts 6 hrs

Clud de Nuit Iconic is a very inoffensive, powdery smooth fragrance with citrus blended very well. Great for daily / office wear. Lasts 6 to 8 hrs.

Olfactory Music Fest has a harsh, strong leathery opening for the first hour but later reminds me of Jazz club. Currently macerating and already shows improvement. Lasts 8 hr+

Club de Nuit Untold is a banger ! Smells like burnt caramel on first spray and has a cedar wood and saffron dry down. Smells niche and high quality. Performance unknown as of now.

Fragrance World Qahwa basically smells like strong coffee with smoke and cardamon. I can see why it can be headache inducing when sprayed too much. I'll see if it gets smoother with emancipation. Performance unknown as of now.

Club de Nuit Woman is a very feminine, inoffensive aromatic, powdery, citrus fresh spicy fragrance. Kinda mouth watering at the dry down. You can over spray this and still get away with it. Good for daily use. Lasts 8 hrs.

Armaf Katarina blue is citrus at opening with vanilla, almond and amber. Good for party / date nights. Excellent in cold weather / nights. Lasts 6 hrs and even better on skin",16,1741832853.0,fragranceclones,14,0.95,False
1ja1s9n,https://i.redd.it/dfyd38hcbdoe1.jpeg,Oh Joann's where will we go now?,"Yarn from what I am pretty sure will be my last Joann's run. I have a lot of feelings on this. As someone who once worked for a company that was bought out by a private equity firm that liquidated all the land the stores were on forcing the stores to pay rent on buildings they'd been operating out of for 40+ years with paid mortgages. I feel for the workers. I have literally been in their shoes. I genuinely feel for each worker at Joann's, and while we are shopping remember  these folks have lost their jobs already and are doing their best. I know when it happened to me over 3/4 of our staff walked out and we were unsure if we would eventually get paid. 

For the last 4 years I've been living in a smaller town in the southwest. The next nearest ""craft store"" is an hour+ away. 

Crafting and specifically crafts involving yarn are a part of the culture in my town. At a local coffee shop there's a knitting/crochet circle that meets a few times a week mostly some older ladies. I once saw one woman's husband hauling in a plastic bin filled with yarn for her as she walked to that yarn circle with a walker. It was absolutely adorable. Farmers markets will have people working on projects or selling them. In the summer we have a bunch of festivals and people will have entire stalls dedicated to hand woven tapestries, tablecloths, knitted/crocheted projects. It may not be in big ways but crafting is undeniably built into the culture of the area I live in. 

While it's a small town plenty of people love crafting weather it's with yarn or not. But it's been very dominated by crocheting and knitting communities here. And those communities are predominantly women. *(Not to say men are not welcome just that it skews heavily towards women.)* 

As I stood in line with what I am pretty sure will be the last time I'll be in there, there was a line of 10+ women. The checkout line had all those reusable bags, some with ""empowered women empower women"" ""empower the women around you"" ""glass ceilings are meant to be broken"" ones for black history month, feminism etc... And I realized for the first time that Joann's was a ""safe space"" for me. I started knitting at around 9 years old and only just started crochet. Joann's has just always been there in the backdrop of my life.

I looked around and I just had a moment where I wondered where will we go? We don't have another craft or yarn store in town. While there are communities of people who get together to crochet and knit together and undoubtedly that will continue. I just felt such an extreme feeling of loss, that the place I run to when I have lost a round of yarn chicken will be gone, the place I go to look at yarns and put them together for a project so I can know how they feel and look together is gone. The place where you could talk to other people interested in the same things for advice is just gone. Countless times I have asked random women in the store what they thought of colors I was using for a knitting project or a crochet project and thwy too would ask my advice. I think this may be hitting me a bit harder because this is the ONLY craft store nearby.

RIP Joann's you will be sorely missed. ",14,1741832850.0,YarnAddicts,0,0.95,False

I don't think I'm  ever going to go back to capsules or mixing it into my coffee ever again. 

The only downside is that if I take too much, I end up getting nauseous for some reason. DPH seems to help, but that just means I have more of my unhealthy vice in the home. I used to take ungodly amounts of Benadryl for fun.

Anyway, i just wanted to post something for potential newbies. It's really much easier than I thought I'd be, and it's much more effective. Id usually down over 20 g. in capsules and still feel like i need more. Now I can cross the line of ""too much"" with a single tablespoon.

Sustained eye contact when we met each other. Each time I see her, she seems to put herself in positions to be around/talk to me. First time I was grabbing some water, she left the bathroom near, double taked me and came over to the fountain, so I chopped it up with her asking advice about our shared hobby since she's a local legend and super impressive. Since then, she'd be stopping to grab some water when I'm walking near, which lines things up so we run into each other. Stopping to check her cell phone in a place I have to walk by, so I say hey, and she starts a conversation. 

Third time I saw her, we hung around one another for a while, so I asked her if she wanted to kick it. Grab a coffee. Play an outdoor activity. She ignored the coffee comment, went off on how bad she is at the activity, but how she would be down. When I went to set a date she was ""busy all month"". So I gave her my number, told her if she finds time to hmu. We kindly small talked and parted. She never hmu. I took it as a rejection. 

This was 5 months ago, and Ive been on dates since then. I gave the situation some space, ran into her a couple weeks later. She came up to me immediately. Starts kindly talking to me. She is incredibly popular, and we run into each other in a place with a lot of men giving her attention, yet she continually comes up to me on the couple of times per month I see her. Conversations can get semi-deep, but she's busy with work and has to cut them after a few minutes. I tried moving on, not actively ignoring her, but not trying to seek her out - when I catch her out of the corner of my eye, she will come up to me pretty quickly to talk, without fail. Still putting herself in positions to talk to me. Im not projecting romantic interest anymofe. However, I can tell she will sometimes look out of the corner of her eyes at me. 

Most recently, I briefly said what's up, moved away. She came over where I was participating in the activity, but I guess was ""busy"" instructing someone. I tried sitting next to her and when I went to talk to her, her back was turned to me. She had an opportunity to sit next to me and her apprentice, opted to sit on the outside excluding me, wouldn't look me in the eye. Yet would cheerlead me when I was participating in the activity. I felt embarrassed, like damn, someone literally turned their back on me and wouldn't look me in the eye. Yet next time I'm there, she comes up to me and tries to catch my eye while I'm talking to others, sweetly says ""hey"" to me, and puts herself in position near me.

She is undoubtedly the most gorgeous person ive met, but it feels like I'm getting mixed signals and like she wants my attention on her terms: quantity, depth, and timing. She seems like someone I'd like to be friends with outside of the confusion, if I can move past romantic feelings. I also dont want to burn the bridge or make our shared space awkward for either of us by ignoring her. But I'm just overall confused. My journal is littered with pages on how I need to move on, it just feels hard with these signals of semi-interest. It is in stark contrast to the women at this activity who clearly project interest in me, though, who like will stick around as long as possible, hint at dating, ask deep questions about me. If she is just seeking my attention, I dont think it's malicious.",1,1741832198.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
