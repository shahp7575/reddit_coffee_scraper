# Best Ice Machine Water Filters: 2025 Reviews & Guide

Maintaining a clean and efficient ice machine relies heavily on the quality of its water supply. Water filters play a crucial role in removing impurities, sediment, and chemicals that can affect the taste, clarity, and longevity of your ice. Selecting the right filter can substantially improve the performance and lifespan of your ice machine, leading to better-tasting ice and reduced maintenance costs. This guide provides a comprehensive review of some of the best ice machine water filters available in 2025, helping you make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of an ice machine water filter depends on several key features that directly impact its performance and longevity.

**Filtration Capacity:** This refers to the amount of water the filter can effectively process before needing replacement. Higher capacity filters are ideal for frequent usage or larger ice machines, reducing the frequency of filter changes. Look for models specifying gallon or liter capacities, along with guidelines regarding the expected filter lifespan under normal operating conditions. Factors like water hardness and sediment levels can impact the real-world longevity of a filter.

**Filtration Media:** Different filters employ various filtration media,each targeting specific contaminants.Activated carbon is commonly used to remove chlorine,chloramine,and other organic compounds that affect taste and odor. Sediment filters trap particulate matter like rust and sand. Specialized media may target lead, cysts, or other contaminants of concern. Understanding the types of contaminants present in your water source will help you select a filter with appropriate media.

**Flow Rate:** the flow rate measures how quickly water passes through the filter. An inadequate flow rate can restrict ice production or cause the machine to work harder, perhaps shortening its lifespan. Check the filter's specification for recommended flow rates in gallons per minute (GPM) or liters per minute (LPM), and ensure it matches the requirements of your ice machine. Insufficient flow can also lead to smaller, misshapen ice cubes.

**Certifications and Standards:** Look for filters certified by reputable organizations like NSF International or the Water Quality Association (WQA).These certifications indicate that the filter has been tested and meets established standards for contaminant reduction and material safety. Certifications provide assurance that the filter performs as claimed and dose not introduce harmful substances into the water supply.

**filter Housing Material and Construction:** The durability of the filter housing is critical, especially in demanding commercial environments. Look for housings made from robust, food-grade materials that can withstand pressure and temperature fluctuations. Check for secure connections and leak-proof seals to prevent water damage and maintain optimal performance. Obvious housings allow for easy visual inspection of filter conditions.

**Easy installation and Maintenance:** A user-friendly design simplifies both installation and filter replacement. Consider filters with quick-connect fittings that require no special tools.A clear and concise installation manual is also essential. Easy access to the filter housing and simple replacement procedures minimize downtime and maintenance costs. Some filters include indicators that signal when a replacement is due based upon water usage or time elapsed.

Key features of the best ice machine water filters include:

*   High filtration capacity
*   Effective filtration media
*   Suitable flow rate
*   Industry certifications
*   Durable construction

## Core benefits

The use of a high-quality ice machine water filter provides a multitude of benefits, improving ice production, taste, and equipment longevity.**Improved Ice Quality and Taste:** filters effectively remove chlorine, sediments, and other impurities, leading to clearer, better-tasting ice.Eliminating contaminants prevents off-flavors and odors from being transferred to beverages, enhancing the overall drinking experience. This is particularly important for commercial establishments where ice quality directly impacts customer satisfaction.**Extended ice Machine Lifespan:** By removing scale-forming minerals and sediment, filters prevent clogs and corrosion within the ice machine's components. This reduces the need for frequent maintenance and repairs, significantly extending the machine's lifespan. Preventing mineral buildup also ensures efficient heat transfer, optimizing ice production and energy consumption.

**Reduced Maintenance Costs:** Implementing a consistent filter replacement schedule minimizes the build-up of scale and sediment, reducing the need for costly professional cleaning and repairs. Filter replacement is a simple and relatively inexpensive maintenance task compared to resolving issues caused by unfiltered water. This can save notable money over time.

**Prevention of Scale Buildup:** Hard water can lead to significant scale buildup in ice machines. This scale reduces efficiency, increases energy consumption, and can ultimately lead to equipment failure.Filters with scale-inhibiting media can prevent this buildup, maintaining optimal performance and reducing maintenance needs.

**Consistency in Ice Production:** A consistent flow of clean water ensures consistent ice production. When the water supply is clogged or restricted due to sediment buildup, ice production can become irregular. A good filter ensures a reliable and steady flow, guaranteeing a consistent supply of ice.

1mqtalm,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeralaRelationships/comments/1mqtalm/long_post_ahead_and_please_bear_with_me/,Long post ahead and please bear with me,"So two years ago, i (f) became friends with S(f).S used to be married to T(m) and T is my dads childhood buds kid. Our families are super close too. However growing up i was never really close to T, never hung out, etc, cause we mostly lived in another state.

After i move back, while T and S are married, I randomly see her here and there and we exchange pleasantries, hi, how are you, hows life, etc. Then they get divorced and I randomly meet her again one day and she calls me to have coffee together. S opens up about her divorce, how nasty she was treated by T and his family, how she got cheated on, etc. From that day, S and I are good friends. We talk mostly about how badly T treated her during the relationship and I listen to all of this in shock and sympathy, as i have only heard good things about their family from my dad.

As time passes S and I find more common ground and have a fun time together. In all this I havent really opened up about myself because most of the time we talk about her life and her problems, which im fine with because i take time to open up and trust people. However my dad tells me that me being friends with S has really strained his relationship with his friend as they feel that S is just using me to get back at T and spread stories about him. I stick up for S to my family. However deep down im worried that I may be hurting my dad and his friend with this friendship, and share all this with her. She accuses me of being scared of my dad and being a people pleaser. This is hurtful because i already stuck up for her behind her back and i felt she wasnt understanding my pov.

As more time passes certain instances make me annoyed at S.

1.	‚Å†She makes me take a gazillion photos of her every time we meet, even if im sick( shes a micro influencer). It seems that she just wants to meet to get photos for the gram.
2.	‚Å†I get a new job that im really excited about and I text her that i got it and that ill be moving, and she suggests we should meet the next day to celebrate. However she barely asks me anything about the job and doesnt seem happy for me.
3.	‚Å†I notice that she talks really badly about some of her other friends, despite being the maid of honor at their wedding. Mind you the bitching session is just before the brides big day and the months leading up to it, not after. She says that the bride is cheap and tries to freeload her way through life, at which point i feel bad for the bride because i know for a fact that she doesnt have much money. I say this and S immediately accuses me of being like the bride.
4.	‚Å†S and I plan a vacation before i leave for my new job a week later. However i have to lie about who im going with to my dad, because they wouldnt be okay with me taking a trip with her. I tell this to S and she flips, understandably. However we go on the trip but i find out shes taken an entire suitcase if clothes for a one day trip for different photoshoots. We spend the entire vacay taking photos. I just wanted it to be a nice relaxed vacation before i start working but i didnt get to relax. Anyways, i keep calm through all this and don‚Äôt confront how i feel with her , cause im leaving anyways and why cause a scene.

However by this point i start to get really frustrated and the resentment starts to build slowly.. when we come back from the trip T reaches out to me and asks if i went on the trip with her ? I say yes, and i ask him to not tell his dad. I also share that T reached out to me to S. She flips and calls me pathetic for being a liar. That was my last straw from her.

I tell her how i dont want to continue the friendship anymore, and send her long paragraphs explaining how i felt each time shes hurt me. From her pov it must have come as a shock to her because i was usually always a yes girl with her, would say yes to everything , mostly to avoid upsetting her. She listens but tells me im overreacting and that none of this ever happened, she twists each thing, saying im really secretive and i never told her about the interview in the first place, so why should she ask about the job ? She doesnt apologize and says some stuff i told her in confidence to support her arguments. Anyways she tells me she never wants to hear from me again. I say okay and then a couple of months pass and i feel really bad, i reach out and apologize but she says the way i spoke to her was not okay, ‚Äòyou dont tell someone you dont want to be their friend anymore‚Äô. So i tell her its because she called me pathetic, but still i cry and beg and plead. Anyways im feeling really shitty so can someone give me insight.",2,1755251858.0,KeralaRelationships,0,1.0,False
1mqtad0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1mqtad0/a_living_page_in_gods_story/,A Living Page in God‚Äôs Story,"I didn‚Äôt set out to write about this. It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been growing quietly in me, shaped by moments I didn‚Äôt realize mattered until much later ‚Äî a conversation over coffee, a message from someone halfway across the world, a passing comment from a friend about how something I shared had stayed with them.

None of these moments felt extraordinary at the time. They were just me, telling my story ‚Äî how God met me in the middle of my struggles, how He helped me grow and heal. But again and again, I‚Äôve seen those words reach into places I could never have planned for‚Ä¶ sometimes into hearts that may never set foot in a church.

And that‚Äôs when it struck me ‚Äî this is exactly how God works. He takes ordinary voices and uses them in extraordinary ways. I kept saying to myself, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this is happening.‚Äù Ordinary me. And yet, through these moments, God was showing me that I am part of the same story He‚Äôs been telling since the days of the disciples and prophets ‚Äî because they, too, were ordinary. It was never about the status of the messenger; it was about the willingness to speak what God had given them.

Somehow, over time, we‚Äôve made the people in Scripture feel like they belong to another world, a separate category of faith. But their lives were written down not to place them on an untouchable pedestal, but to show us what is possible when God moves through ordinary lives ‚Äî and to remind us that His story is still unfolding in ours.

I believe there is a place for humble, servant-hearted pastors ‚Äî true shepherds who guide and equip rather than dominate and centralize the Word. But the life of the Church was never meant to rest solely on their shoulders. Pastors can‚Äôt go everywhere. They try through TV, radio, livestreams, and social media ‚Äî but there are still corners of the world, and corners of the heart, they will never reach. That‚Äôs why we are all so important.

Yet, in many churches today, most of the speaking ‚Äî and the responsibility for the Word ‚Äî is in the hands of one person. Week after week, the congregation listens faithfully but may not realize they are meant to be active messengers too. When the pulpit becomes the sole voice, the rest of the body can fall silent.

Jesus showed us a different way. He didn‚Äôt stay inside the synagogue or limit His message to the religious elite. He walked dusty roads, lingered at wells, sat in strangers‚Äô homes, touched the untouchable, fed the hungry, and calmed storms. Each miracle, each parable, each act of mercy was a seed planted in the heart of an ordinary person ‚Äî meant to grow into a testimony that would ripple outward.

He chose twelve disciples as a model, not as the only ones who would carry His message, but as proof of what happens when ordinary people are called, equipped, and sent. We are all meant to be disciples in that same line. The call didn‚Äôt stop with them; it multiplies with us. If He found fishermen, tax collectors, zealots, and outcasts effective messengers then‚Ä¶ what has changed now? Only this: tradition and routine have sometimes narrowed the flow of the Word to a single voice, when it was always meant to be a living chorus.

The early church was alive with participation. But today, many of us have settled into being fed without ever feeding others. And a body cannot thrive if most of its members are dormant.

I believe God is stirring His people to awaken. To step out of the audience and into the work. Not everyone can sing a hymn or preach a sermon, but everyone has a voice. Everyone has a story. And each time you share what God has done for you, you add a page to the story He is still telling.

Maybe that‚Äôs part of what we‚Äôre seeing in this restless, shifting moment for the Church ‚Äî God making space for His people to remember what it was always meant to be: a living, breathing body where every member is part of His work.

Your testimony might matter more than you will ever know. It might knit the body back together, restore what is broken, and carry the Good News into places a pulpit will never reach.

And yet, through these moments, God was showing me that I am part of the same story He‚Äôs been telling since the days of the disciples and prophets ‚Äî because they, too, were ordinary. It was never about the status of the messenger; it was about the willingness to speak what God had given them.

Somehow, over time, we‚Äôve made the people in Scripture feel like they belong to another world, a separate category of faith. But their lives were written down not to place them on an untouchable pedestal, but to show us what is possible when God moves through ordinary lives ‚Äî and to remind us that His story is still unfolding in ours.

I believe there is a place for humble, servant-hearted pastors ‚Äî true shepherds who guide and equip rather than dominate and centralize the Word. But the life of the Church was never meant to rest solely on their shoulders. Pastors can‚Äôt go everywhere. They try through TV, radio, livestreams, and social media ‚Äî but there are still corners of the world, and corners of the heart, they will never reach. That‚Äôs why we are all so important.

Yet, in many churches today, most of the speaking ‚Äî and the responsibility for the Word ‚Äî is in the hands of one person. Week after week, the congregation listens faithfully but may not realize they are meant to be active messengers too. When the pulpit becomes the sole voice, the rest of the body can fall silent.

Jesus showed us a different way. He didn‚Äôt stay inside the synagogue or limit His message to the religious elite. He walked dusty roads, lingered at wells, sat in strangers‚Äô homes, touched the untouchable, fed the hungry, and calmed storms. Each miracle, each parable, each act of mercy was a seed planted in the heart of an ordinary person ‚Äî meant to grow into a testimony that would ripple outward.

He chose twelve disciples as a model, not as the only ones who would carry His message, but as proof of what happens when ordinary people are called, equipped, and sent. We are all meant to be disciples in that same line. The call didn‚Äôt stop with them; it multiplies with us. If He found fishermen, tax collectors, zealots, and outcasts effective messengers then‚Ä¶ what has changed now? Only this: tradition and routine have sometimes narrowed the flow of the Word to a single voice, when it was always meant to be a living chorus.

The early church was alive with participation. But today, many of us have settled into being fed without ever feeding others. And a body cannot thrive if most of its members are dormant.

I believe God is stirring His people to awaken. To step out of the audience and into the work. Not everyone can sing a hymn or preach a sermon, but everyone has a voice. Everyone has a story. And each time you share what God has done for you, you add a page to the story He is still telling.

Maybe that‚Äôs part of what we‚Äôre seeing in this restless, shifting moment for the Church ‚Äî God making space for His people to remember what it was always meant to be: a living, breathing body where every member is part of His work.

Your testimony might matter more than you will ever know. It might knit the body back together, restore what is broken, and carry the Good News into places a pulpit will never reach.

The Word is alive ‚Äî and you are a living page of it.",1,1755251774.0,theology,0,1.0,False

1mqt64k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheKameena/comments/1mqt64k/aitk_long_post_ahead_girlfriends/,AITK ?? Long post ahead.. girlfriends,"So two years ago, i (f) became friends with S(f).S used to be married to T(m) and T is my dads childhood buds kid. Our families are super close too. However growing up i was never really close to T, never hung out, etc, cause we mostly lived in another state.

After i move back, while T and S are married, I randomly see her here and there and we exchange pleasantries, hi, how are you, hows life, etc. Then they get divorced and I randomly meet her again one day and she calls me to have coffee together. S opens up about her divorce, how nasty she was treated by T and his family, how she got cheated on, etc. From that day, S and I are good friends. We talk mostly about how badly T treated her during the relationship and I listen to all of this in shock and sympathy, as i have only heard good things about their family from my dad.

As time passes S and I find more common ground and have a fun time together. In all this I havent really opened up about myself because most of the time we talk about her life and her problems, which im fine with because i take time to open up and trust people. However my dad tells me that me being friends with S has really strained his relationship with his friend as they feel that S is just using me to get back at T and spread stories about him. I stick up for S to my family. However deep down im worried that I may be hurting my dad and his friend with this friendship, and share all this with her. She accuses me of being scared of my dad and being a people pleaser.

As more time passes certain instances make me annoyed at S.

1.	‚Å†She makes me take a gazillion photos of her every time we meet, even if im sick( shes a micro influencer). It seems that she just wants to meet to get photos for the gram.
2.	‚Å†I get a new job that im really excited about and I text her that i got it and that ill be moving, and she suggests we should meet the next day to celebrate. However she barely asks me anything about the job and doesnt seem happy for me.
3.	‚Å†I notice that she talks really badly about some of her other friends, despite being the maid of honor at their wedding. Mind you the bitching session is just before the brides big day and the months leading up to it, not after. She says that the bride is cheap and tries to freeload her way through life, at which point i feel bad for the bride because i know for a fact that she doesnt have much money. I say this and S immediately accuses me of being like the bride.
4.	‚Å†S and I plan a vacation before i leave for my new job a week later. However i have to lie about who im going with to my dad, because they wouldnt be okay with me taking a trip with her. I tell this to S and she flips, understandably. However we go on the trip but i find out shes taken an entire suitcase if clothes for a one day trip for different photoshoots. We spend the entire vacay taking photos. I just wanted it to be a nice relaxed vacation before i start working but i didnt get to relax. Anyways, i keep calm through all this and don‚Äôt confront how i feel with her , cause im leaving anyways and why cause a scene.


However by this point i start to get really frustrated and the resentment starts to build slowly.. when we come back from the trip T reaches out to me and asks if i went on the trip with her ? I say yes, and i ask him to not tell his dad. I also share that T reached out to me to S. She flips and calls me pathetic for being a liar. That was my last straw from her.

I tell her how i dont want to continue the friendship anymore, and send her long paragraphs explaining how i felt each time shes hurt me. From her pov it must have come as a shock to her because i was usually always a yes girl with her, would say yes to everything , mostly to avoid upsetting her. She listens but tells me im overreacting and that none of this ever happened, she twists each thing, saying im really secretive and i never told her about the interview in the first place, so why should she ask about the job ? She doesnt apologize and says some stuff i told her in confidence to support her arguments. Anyways she tells me she never wants to hear from me again. I say okay and then a couple of months pass and i feel really bad, i reach out and apologize but she says the way i spoke to her was not okay, ‚Äòyou dont tell someone you dont want to be their friend anymore‚Äô. So i tell her its because she called me pathetic, but keep apologising profusely to the point where im crying and feeling like a horrible person for saying all that to her. She asks me to reread the messages i sent her and i do, its paras of me explaining how i got hurt. Deep down i always felt like if i ever told her how she‚Äôs upsetting me she wont be my friend anymore. She has a history of cutting out people and now im one of them.

Other things I stereotypically associate with FL are it being a monarchy (apparently one of the last real monarchies, not just on paper), Hilti, being shit at football (just like any other microstate), and sick license plates!

But from what I‚Äôve read online, nobody‚Äôs really showing off their wealth, and it looks just like any random Swiss mid-town. Clean, quiet, and basically nothing ever happens there. Apart from some scenic mountains for those who are into hiking, there‚Äôs not really much to see.

So how‚Äôs everyday life there? I suppose culturally it's just like Switzerland. But:

‚Ä¢ Is the dialect Swiss German, or do FL‚Äôs have their own?

‚Ä¢ Do you like your neighbours or foreigners?

‚Ä¢ Do you feel a strong national identity?

‚Ä¢ Does everyone know each other in FL? Do you randomly see the prince in town? Are people friends with him?

‚Ä¢ What do young people do there? Are there night bars or anything at all? From what I saw, FL looks like a place where only Methusalems can have fun, like those traditional Gasthofs etc. F**k me, I can't imagine any young king living the life in Liechtenstein. Guess they turn into B√ºnzlis as soon as they turn 14.

‚Ä¢ Are there any expats in FL at all? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever heard of someone moving to or working in FL.

‚Ä¢ I'm from Germany, but only like 2 hours away from FL. Never bothered to visit, 'cause I know it doesn‚Äôt have much to offer, but if I‚Äôm unterwegs, I might actually stop by just to see it first-hand. Any locals down for a coffee or a beer?

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1mqswb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mqswb7/aio_long_post_ahead/,AIO ?? Long post ahead,"So two years ago, i (f) became friends with S(f).S used to be married to T(m) and T is my dads childhood buds kid. Our families are super close too. However growing up i was never really close to T, never hung out, etc, cause we mostly lived in another state. 

After i move back, while T and S are married, I randomly see her here and there and we exchange pleasantries, hi, how are you, hows life, etc. Then they get divorced and I randomly meet her again one day and she calls me to have coffee together. S opens up about her divorce, how nasty she was treated by T and his family, how she got cheated on, etc. From that day, S and I are good friends. We talk mostly about how badly T treated her during the relationship and I listen to all of this in shock and sympathy, as i have only heard good things about their family from my dad. 

As time passes S and I find more common ground and have a fun time together. In all this I havent really opened up about myself because most of the time we talk about her life and her problems, which im fine with because i take time to open up and trust people. However my dad tells me that me being friends with S has really strained his relationship with his friend as they feel that S is just using me to get back at T and spread stories about him. I stick up for S to my family. However deep down im worried that I may be hurting my dad and his friend with this friendship, and share all this with her. She accuses me of being scared of my dad and being a people pleaser. 

As more time passes certain instances make me annoyed at S. 
1. She makes me take a gazillion photos of her every time we meet, even if im sick( shes a micro influencer). It seems that she just wants to meet to get photos for the gram.

2. I get a new job that im really excited about and I text her that i got it and that ill be moving, and she suggests we should meet the next day to celebrate. However she barely asks me anything about the job and doesnt seem happy for me. 

3. I notice that she talks really badly about some of her other friends, despite being the maid of honor at their wedding. Mind you the bitching session is just before the brides big day and the months leading up to it, not after. She says that the bride is cheap and tries to freeload her way through life, at which point i feel bad for the bride because i know for a fact that she doesnt have much money. I say this and S immediately accuses me of being like the bride.

4. S and I plan a vacation before i leave for my new job a week later. However i have to lie about who im going with to my dad, because they wouldnt be okay with me taking a trip with her. I tell this to S and she flips, understandably. However we go on the trip but i find out shes taken an entire suitcase if clothes for a one day trip for different photoshoots. We spend the entire vacay taking photos. I just wanted it to be a nice relaxed vacation before i start working but i didnt get to relax.
Anyways, i keep calm through all this and don‚Äôt confront how i feel with her , cause im leaving anyways and why cause a scene. 

However by this point i start to get really frustrated and the resentment starts to build slowly.. when we come back from the trip T reaches out to me and asks if i went on the trip with her ? I say yes, and i ask him to not tell his dad. I also share that T reached out to me to S. She flips and calls me pathetic for being a liar. That was my last straw from her.

I tell her how i dont want to continue the friendship anymore, and send her long paragraphs explaining how i felt each time shes hurt me. From her pov it must have come as a shock to her because i was usually always a yes girl with her, would say yes to everything , mostly to avoid upsetting her. She listens but tells me im overreacting and that none of this ever happened, she twists each thing, saying im really secretive and i never told her about the interview in the first place, so why should she ask about the job ? She doesnt apologize and says some stuff i told her in confidence to support her arguments. Anyways she tells me she never wants to hear from me again. I say okay and then a couple of months pass and i feel really bad, i reach out and apologize but she says the way i spoke to her was not okay, ‚Äòyou dont tell someone you dont want to be their friend anymore‚Äô. So i tell her its because she called me pathetic. Anyways im feeling really shitty so can someone tell me if im OR ?

1mqsvnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlasticObesity/comments/1mqsvnb/the_case_against_recyling_plastic/,The case against recyling plastic,"*contents of the one and only email I have ever sent to the local MP [Member of Parliament], with minor changes, to explain UK specific terms*

For years, I have done my bit to recycle items with a recycling sign on them using the local council's [UK local authorities] facilities. I was grateful the council had these facilities and happy that some of my council tax [UK local tax, loosely based on property value] went towards them. I had high hopes of it being re-cycled and felt good that my efforts were contributing to that. I was vaguely aware that some things are not recycled, some may get shipped to other countries to be burned, etc. but I still thought - everyone is doing their best here.

One single realisation pierced through this veil of naivity - learning that it is *not technologically possible* to recycle most plastics more than 1-2 times. The continous arrows recycling sign on plastic goods has to be one of the greatest advertising cons of all times. You cannot recycle plastic forever as suggested by the recycling sign and every time it gets recycled, most plastic has to be 'downgraded' in fuction - i.e a recycled 'food safe' [within the meaning of current regulations, I don't think any plastic is food safe] plastic may no longer be 'food safe' the second time around. After 1-2 recycles (assuming it gets that), it still ends up in landfill. 

Additionally, it is *technologically not feasible* to recycle plastic coated card-board / paper as it is very difficult to separate the two materials -  and therefore the vast majority of take away & coffee single use containers and a good proportion of food packaging is not recycled. 

As for re-use / multi-use plastics, there is the danger of endocrine disrupting plasticisers (phtalates, Bisphenols, etc.) leaching out and micro-plastics being released when using them. They are also less durable than the alternatives (wood, glass, steel). The downsides seem to outweight the benefits. 

Having this in mind, the current focus of policy, resources, public awareness etc. on recycling and re-using plastics as opposed to stop using them alltoghether feels like complete madness. It feels as if we have collectively fallen for the recycling con, for the benefit of those who make money from plastics - 

- raw plastic, plastic goods & packaging producers

- corporate plastic users who use it to simplify their logistics and increase profitability (supermarkets, take-aways).

- general businesses who love to replace durable parts with cheap plastics in their products, to increase profitability (clothing? Appliances? Construction materials?).

We are collectively not doing our best here - instead, we have been conned into putting a lot of public and individual effort into maintaining a status quo that does not benefit us as consumers, may make us ill, and promises to turn the whole country into one massive landfill. 

Therefore I can only advocate for and kindly ask that [insert political party of said MP] has the courage to push for a clear 'Reduce Plastic' approach and focus money and policy towards it instead of perpetuating the plastic recycling nonsense. 

WHY?

- Use of plastic packaging adds little functional benefit to the consumer outside an illusion of convenience. Whatever time convenience is gained from not bringing a cup / bottle / box / bag to the shop, it is lost by having to deal with mountains of rubbish every day. Consumers could do without most plastic packaging with suitable alternatives in place (see how, below) - the benefit of plastic use lays squarely with retailers / manufacturers. 

- Any cost savings in logistics that supermakerts / shops may make as a result of plastic use are not passed on to consumers (a glance at supermarket and take aways profit margins over long periods of time may give some clues into that). So consumers are paying for plastic packaging at point of sale and then again paying for its disposal and clean-up through council tax. Plastic does not make a product cheaper for consumers, just more profitable for seller and government managed recycling enables this. 

- Plastics taint other recyclable materials (cardboard), meaning less of those are actually recycled.

- Use of plastics typically makes for less durable long use products. So while cheap at point of sale, the cost per year of use of these goods is much higher (tupperware lasts less than a year before it stains, smells and change shape; Stainless steel containers are for life). Back to the illusion of convenience - consumers constantly spend time replacing less durable plastic goods. 

- We are dependent on a vast amount of plastics we do not produce in UK for critical supply chains such as  food. That can become a problem if the main supplier of plastics (China) decides to tighten conditions of supply. 

- The scientific consensus is starting to recognise that plasticisers are a potentially much larger public health concern than originally thought, especially in the development of non-communicable diseases such as obesity and diabetes. If researchers are right, that's probably the highest cost we pay for plastics and best argument for a universal phase out of a wide range of types of plastics.


HOW? 

- Regulate the use of the recycling sign on products to reflect the reality of what can and cannot be recycled, and how many times. The 'forever recyclable' arrow triangle sign should probably only apply to metals and certain types of glass / ceramics. Plastics and plastic coated items should not display such a sign as it is grossly misleading consumers and is an excellent example of subtle but potent greenwashing. 

- Install drinking water fountains in all built up areas. Why would anyone buy plastic water bottles then?

- Encourage eat-in, canteen-style food businesses (using real plates) instead of take-aways (Singapore's food courts in every neighbourhood are a prime example). We all love the convenience of not cooking for ourselves, but there are many ways of achieving it other than with plastic coated container take-aways prepared in dark kitchens. There is plenty of unused / underused high-street space for this, business rates / licensing rules can be skewed towards one type of business not the other. 

- Estimate the cost of handling and cleaning up plastics and related rubbish. Make sure this is deducted from consumers' council tax bill and covered by a (high) national plastic packaging tax charged on corporate users of plastic. Impact on consumers should be zero - what you lose out in higher prices, you gain on reduced council tax. Plastic free high street businesses should be entitled to a business rates cut [UK local tax, business' equivalent of 'council tax'] too as they are producing less rubbish (which may incentivise takeaways towards a 'bring your own container' model and real plates for eat-in). 

- Introduce standardised, reusable packaging for staple products (e.g. standard milk, juice, beer, etc. glass bottles, yoghurt / sauce glass jars, standardised take-away boxes, etc.) that food manufacturers can choose to use. With a high plastic tax, this option may become appealing. Having manned meat / cheese / fish / deli counters in shops may become appealing again too. Consumers get a discount on next pourchase for bringing the reusable package back.  

- Impose long product warrantees for any durable goods and industrial machinery. Plastic is an enabler of planned obsolescence, which is a source of polution. Shifting responsibility for repairs onto equipmenr manufacturers  may incentivise the use of durable (non plastic) parts. 

- Accelerate research into the impact of plastics on health. If initial findings in this area pan out, many non-environmentally minded people will be keen to avoid plastics for their own health. 


THE COUNTER-ARGUMENTS

- People are too time / money poor to get on board with this. Consumers don't benefit financially from plastics (on the contrary, they pay for it indirecly) and the convenience offered is illusory and can be replaced with alternative solutions. Positioning the move away from plastic as an innovation and improvement to their lives as opposed to a regulation driven change would go a long way to help.

- The CO2 emissions / environmental impact of replacing plastics with say glass / steel, etc. may be the same or higher than the current impact of plastics. Potentially true - though I doubt the calculations factor in renewable energy as opposed to fossil fuel use in transport and production. However, I would question the validity of framing all environmental issues in terms of emissions impact alone and ignoring equally important issues of pollution and public health in the process.  

- This will be the next culture war - Likely true. But so is recycling. Dissociating the issue from climate change (which already is a big culture war issue) and highlighting the toxic pollution / public health angle, on which there is wider public consensus, may help in this respect. Another mitigating factor is opting for policies that are subtly changing people' and businesses' practices, while going un-noticed and un-preached about. By the time anyone notices publicly, 60% of the work is already done.

- Plastics have useful applications - I am sure they do, and use can never be reduced to zero. However, the current rampant consumer use of plastics is wholy unnecessary, unwanted and counter productive and it should be the first one to be reduced. 

- We'll develop some plastic eating bacteria and this issue will go away. Besides stating the obvious that we are nowhere near having such bacteria (and arguably they may cause serious issues in a plastic based world if we had them), that may fix pollution, but not public health concerns or climate concerns (assuming plastics impact is higher than that of plastic replacers). 

- This is anti business - Arguably it is pro certain businesses and anti - other businesses. Capitalism is endlessly adaptable to the lure of money, so I am fully confident it will figure out a way of making money in a low plastic environment. 

Whilst I do my best to reduce my plastic use, I cannot do it alone. I am often caught out in a consumer world that relies on plastic and makes it inconvenient for me to go plastic free. I am sure most consumers would feel it is too burdensome to go plastic free in current conditions and likely be against it. That is why it is essential that a framework of policy, incentives and infrastructure is developed first, to slowly encourage people and  businesses to reduce plastic. It is also important that such a change is perceived as an innovation and improvement on people's lives, which they willingly adopt for their own benefit (as opposed to state mandated burden to content with).

At the risk of repeating well know phrases - this is a systemic problem that needs systemic solutions, and with the best will in the world, individual responsibility and action can only go so far (especially when swimming against the tide if corporate profits). Hence I am bringing this to your attention hoping it may influence your thinking and priorities.

PS1: Oh, so you sent it to the MP? What happened? Did they respond? 

NOTHING happened, no response was ever received. 

If you have any tips on how to get UK MPs, of any political stripe, to care about ANYTHING that makes normal people lives' harder, please let me know. 

NO, signing a petition does not count and NO, I don't fancy getting arrested at a protest either. It has got to be legal & craftier than that.

*************

PS2: Don't buy your food in recycled plastic! In fact, don't buy any recycled plastic products. If you can, just don't buy much plastic at all (but I know it's hard right now!) From a contamination perspective, recycled plastic is worse than virgin plastic. It needs a second infusion of plasticisers to make it work. 

Please don't encourage this plastic recycling nonsense!

What actions or boundaries made a difference?

Last month, I lost my job and was struggling with anxiety and depression. My boyfriend said he wanted a break because my conversations felt negative to him. We decided to try again but kept some distance. During that time, I learned from my best friend that he‚Äôd gone for coffee with another woman and never told me, even after she encouraged him to. We talked it out and agreed to work on things.

The weekend before his birthday, we went out with his friends. At one bar, I turned around and saw my sister and brother-in-law ‚Äî two people I have a complicated, hurtful history with ‚Äî and my boyfriend hadn‚Äôt told me they‚Äôd be there. I‚Äôd recently made peace with my brother-in-law, but hadn‚Äôt spoken to my sister yet, so it felt blindsiding. While I was talking to her, two women approached him, one touched his arm, and he engaged with her in a flirty way ‚Äî despite barely speaking to me all night. On top of that, he‚Äôs been messaging and hanging out with my sister and brother-in-law without telling me because he thought I‚Äôd be mad, even though he knows it crosses a clear boundary for me. It‚Äôs not about controlling who he talks to, but I moved out from living with them due to ongoing issues and haven‚Äôt spoken to them since.

The Tuesday after on his birthday, I went all out with gifts and a special night. Things seemed good ‚Äî until a few days later on Friday night soon after when I learned from other women that he‚Äôd been active on Tinder and Hinge. I had felt off that night about if he was telling the truth about the coffee date. I hemmed and hard for an hour or two because I‚Äôm not one to look for problems, but something was telling me to open Instagram and message the girls that he had recently followed. One woman told me they had gone for coffee and they hung out after and he kissed her. He wanted to do more she told me but didn‚Äôt want to so she left. Another said he invited her over that Friday night, had drinks, made out, and had sex with her. I confronted him, and he admitted it, blaming it partly on my lower sex drive from medication (even though we were still intimate weekly). We talked for about an hour and a half that night ‚Äî he apologized and really opened up about how he‚Äôd been feeling. Communication had been one of our biggest struggles: I‚Äôd been trying to talk to him more, but he sometimes felt it was nagging, so he would shut down thinking it would lead to a fight. I apologized for my part in that, but also shared that a relationship means dealing with things together and having hard conversations, which is what I‚Äôve been trying to express for a while. I‚Äôm definitely more of an anxious attachment style and he‚Äôs more avoidant, and we‚Äôve recently started recognizing that and trying to better understand each other. 

The cheating happened just two weeks ago, and I‚Äôm torn ‚Äî part of me wants to fight for us, part of me knows my worth and fears I‚Äôll regret staying. I‚Äôm a very aware person.

Each morning is difficult and I feel like the more time passes the more tired I have become from grief and of the pain. My sister and I have had psychotic episodes since our mum died, we were healthy before this loss. I think my sister is doing well now, though I am struggling a lot. I have resolved to trying each day to do something good for others and it does help.

I wake up to dreams of my mum.. I feel like even when I sleep I am suffering though I do manage to sleep. Grief does get better for most people so I hope if you have lost someone you will take comfort in knowing that. I think what has perpetuated the grief is the lonliness I feel. There isn't really anybody I feel I can turn to when I need or just loyal friends to have a good time with which I believe would help me to forget some of my suffering. I recently asked a friend if she would meet up with me for a coffee as it had been awhile and her response was in other words that she will be at an event where I could find her. I felt it was cold, I hadn't really spoken to her since I came out of hospital where I was for a month. The reason that led me to getting ill and being in hospital was realising someone didn't care for me the way I did for that person. This really broke me and since then I can't picture my life with anyone. I feel like people are not real or say what they mean. These stories are honestly just scraping the tip of the iceburg. I would say I realised three other people who I would have considered friends have also proven not to be by their actions in the last year. I have two friends left but it's not so easy one is pregnant now, we are just in a completely different phase of life, but maybe that shouldn't be an obstacle? The other has recently made other friends so I am no longer the go to girl fir her, though I know she will always be a friend it's just hard because I feel us distancing and I really hate that but I know she is ok with it. It's hard I'm 24 but feel so much older. I hope to return to college study something intense and just try to be busy but I don't know if I can get funding and if not I won't have means to support myself.

For the next **30 days**, I‚Äôll spend 30 minutes every single day learning \[your Topic\]. No excuses. No ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it tomorrow.‚Äù No mysterious YouTube rabbit holes (‚Ä¶okay, maybe fewer of them).



Why 30 days? Because it‚Äôs just long enough to trick my brain into making it a habit, but short enough that it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm signing a lifetime contract.



I‚Äôm starting today (15th August ‚Äî India‚Äôs Independence Day üáÆüá≥) because nothing screams freedom like breaking free from my own procrastination.

‚∏ª

Background:
	‚Ä¢	First noticed them during sports as a teen: e.g., playing football (soccer) on hot days ‚Üí headache 1‚Äì2 hours after the match.

What I‚Äôve tried:

	‚Ä¢	Tried novalgin and magnesium ‚Äì no lasting improvement.
	‚Ä¢	Stopped coffee and alcohol for the past month ‚Üí slight improvement at rest, but not for exercise-triggered headaches.

https://youtu.be/dFEsglbAeP0?si=z_UgS77xBUKolWyb

Story:

I moved into the house in late October.

It was quiet, set back from the road, with a big backyard and old hardwood floors that creaked when you walked. Charming stuff, the kind of place real estate agents call ‚Äúfull of character.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt care. I just needed out of the city. Out of the apartment I used to share with someone I‚Äôd rather forget.

The house was cheap. Suspiciously cheap, actually. I should‚Äôve known something was off, but I was tired, broke, and desperate to start over. I told myself it was just good luck.

The first few nights were uneventful. Peaceful, even. I unpacked, made coffee, read in bed. Enjoyed some rainy weather. No traffic, no neighbors yelling through thin walls. Just the hum of the fridge and the occasional breeze rattling the windowpanes. 

Plus, being alone meant I could finally sleep talk in peace again. My ex used to bully me for it, excessively.

I was enjoying the remaining solitude I had left before going back to work. Then, on the fourth night, I heard it.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Three soft knocks at my bedroom window. The one that faces the backyard. I sat up, heart already thudding. I thought maybe it was a branch, or the wind, or some animal.

Then I heard the voice.

‚ÄúCan I come in?‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt loud. But it was eerily deadpan and pushed out between a breathe

I didn‚Äôt answer. I certainly didn‚Äôt move. I waited another hour before I even dared to peek out the window.

Nothing.

Just the backyard.. still and faintly moonlit. No footprints in the mud. No one standing out there.

The next night, it happened again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

‚ÄúCan I come in?‚Äù

Same voice. Same tone. Like this was just something we did now.

That‚Äôs when I remembered the note.

I‚Äôd found it the day I moved in. It was tucked inside the kitchen cabinet. I almost threw it out. It was written on a torn piece of yellow notebook paper, in smeared, shaky handwriting:

If he knocks, do not say yes.

At the time, I thought it was some weird joke from the last tenant. I tossed it aside. Now, I wasn‚Äôt so sure.

I started digging online, looking through old forums, late-night paranormal threads, anything. That‚Äôs when I saw it.

The Lamp Man.

Some called him an urban legend. Others, something far more. Not a ghost. Not quite a monster. But‚Ä¶ an agile skin creature with a lamp shade for its head . A thing that lives under the dirt. Not buried.. waiting. Every night, it digs itself out and knocks. Always three times. Always asking the same question.

If you say yes, it doesn‚Äôt walk through the door. It slips in ‚Äî through vents, cracks in the walls, the spaces you forget to check. It hides. Under beds. Inside closets. Inside of curtains. He waits.

He doesn‚Äôt strike right away. Sometimes hours. Sometimes days. But eventually, he gets hungry.

And when he eats, nothing‚Äôs left behind.

No screams. No blood. Just a missing lamp.

That part stuck with me. He collects lamps. Every story said the same thing. When the Lamp Man comes, one lamp always disappears. That‚Äôs how you know he‚Äôs inside.

On the tenth night, I woke up to find broken lightbulb glass in the guest room seemingly sweeped up into a pile in the corner.

I hadn‚Äôt said yes. I know I hadn‚Äôt. And I checked every light in my house, there were no lights missing.

But who could‚Äôve done this

I checked the locks. All secure. Windows shut. Vents intact. But I could feel it.. this heavy wrongness in the air. Like the house was holding its breath. Like I was being watched from just under the bed or around the hallway corner.

Still, every night after that, he knocked.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

‚ÄúCan I come in?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer.

I couldn‚Äôt.

I started counting my lamps obsessively. Thirteen total. I‚Äôd walk through the house every morning and check each one. Even the ugly ceramic one in the laundry room.

Then, two nights ago, the hallway lamp vanished. No sound. No broken glass. It just wasn‚Äôt there anymore.

That was the night I stopped sleeping.

I pushed a bookshelf in front of the vent. Shoved towels into the gaps under doors. Left every light on.

Last night was the worst. There was no knock. No voice. Just silence.

And when I opened my eyes, the lamp on my nightstand was gone.

I sat up, heart in my throat. The room felt colder. Not drafty ‚Äî occupied. Like I wasn‚Äôt alone anymore.

I didn‚Äôt hear footsteps. But I felt something. Something near the edge of the bed. Something just under the frame. Watching. Waiting.

I don‚Äôt know how long I laid there. Hours. Maybe more. I didn‚Äôt dare move. I didn‚Äôt dare speak. Every part of me screamed to run, to leave the house, but I couldn‚Äôt.

Because I know what happens next.

He waits until you feel safe again. Until you think maybe he left. Until you stop looking.. Then he eats.

I don‚Äôt know how much longer I have. If I am to leave this house, it will follow me. I‚Äôm writing this with every light on. My body is so very-..

I‚Äôve pushed furniture against every vent, nailed every window shut. Every light is out. I watch as he sleeps for the last time. His eyes closed gently, like last we spoke. Thank you for letting me in.

My idea is to spend 4 days in Bangkok, 6 somewhere else and then finish the trip by staying in Bangkok for around another week since I'm flying in and out of the city.

I already have a few ideas for hostels in Bangkok, but I'm not sure where to go in between. I wanted to do Pattaya city, Phuket and Koh Tao but I don't think I'll be able to do all three and stay in a budget or how to get there since I don't drive.

I've been trying to get into journaling for years but every app I downloaded felt... wrong.

**My specific frustrations:**

* Apps like Day One wanted me to write these long, reflective entries every single day. Sometimes I just want to jot down a quick thought during lunch, you know?
* Most store your private thoughts on their servers. Why would I want some company reading my journal entries for ""AI insights""?
* The streak pressure was killing me. Miss one day and you're back to zero. Made journaling feel like a chore instead of something helpful.
* So many unnecessary features - complicated mood tracking, photo collages, sharing options. I just wanted to write stuff down.

**What I actually wanted:**

* Multiple short entries throughout the day when inspiration hits
* My data staying on MY devices (iCloud sync, but it's still mine)
* No guilt if I skip days or want to add something I thought of yesterday
* Just... simple text entry. That's it.

Couldn't find anything that matched this, so I spent some time building Inkwell for myself.

Now I actually journal regularly because it doesn't fight me. Sometimes it's just ""good coffee this morning,"" other times it's deeper stuff. No pressure either way.

If anyone wants to try it out, I'd genuinely appreciate the feedback‚Äîespecially if you've had similar frustrations with other journaling apps. Still learning what works for different people.

I know a lot of you are still buying leads, then sitting at your desk with a cup of coffee, ready to dial cold and ‚Äúwarm‚Äù leads‚Ä¶ only to spend hours calling for nothing, chasing the same recycled names everyone else is calling.

That‚Äôs just a gamble honestly. In business, you need certainty, speaking only with clients who are ready to be closed and deeply interested in your offer, service and the results you can deliver.

You can‚Äôt sell someone juice if they‚Äôre looking for water.

With that being said, what you need is an Inbound lead-acquisition system. A lead generating system that delivers you HIGH quality leads straight to your CRM. Leads that are interested in YOUR service, in YOUR company, and ready to book an appointment with YOU today.

**And this works exceptionally well for High-Ticket Businesses.**¬†

I consider High-Ticket to be anything **starting at $3k**.

Now, let me explain how this system can give you back your **TIME**, help you close more clients than you‚Äôve ever imagined, and ultimately scale your business to the next level.

The system I‚Äôm going to share is one where you target with words. You might be like, words? Yep, words are the powerhouse of this system. If you can manage to make your words create emotions that move people to take action, this could be buying, booking, or more. Then you‚Äôll have a winning system.

Words are a tool that must be **EMOTIONALLY** compelling to the reader and also make logical sense. With a combination of both, you can influence decisions and drive action.

You‚Äôll use these words to craft a *Sales Letter* that does all the heavy lifting ‚Äî educating, filtering, and pre-selling.

This is tricky given the fact that nowadays we have access to generative AI, but let me set this straight. AI cannot REPLICATE emotions. You are the one who understands your audience, their struggles, and what truly moves them to act.

If you use ChatGPT to create your ‚ÄúSales Letter‚Äù you are bound to **FAIL**.¬†

Now, in order to get this Sales Letter attention, we must send traffic to it. We will use Facebook ads for this, setting up a campaign optimized for leads.

What the Sales Letter will do is filter out *bad prospects* so that only those with genuine interest and the funds to move forward will make it through. And you will do that by having your opt-in at the bottom of the page, to ensure the prospect has consumed your offer.

After the prospect opts in, redirect them to a booking page and **BOOM** ‚Äî high quality leads. Have everything integrated so the information is sent directly to your CRM, notifying you instantly of new leads/appointments.

But sadly, the work isn‚Äôt done yet. Facebook then starts working against you lol. Your prospects that interacted with your ad, will get bombarded with similar ads from your competitors, and might end up siding with them.

So, in order to combat that, you must manually follow up with them the day of opt-in or booked day. Calling them to reassure them that you‚Äôre a **REAL** person and that you genuinely care about helping them with your service. Tying their pain and desires into a solution that YOUR service WILL solve.

And that is **MANDATORY** to follow...

After that, you can just set up automated reminders until the booked date.

Then, just close‚Ä¶

You can have this system running **FOREVER** and scale even further by simply increasing the ad budget.

I'd recommend scaling from a different ad account but still sending traffic to the same Sales Letter landing page. Just a faster approach to scale 2x - 3x.

Best of luck to all of yall. Go implement this for your Service-Based Business and watch how quickly your calendar fills up.

Let me know if this post was useful in any way.

# Introduction: The Coffee Problem We All Know

For millions of people, the day doesn‚Äôt start without a cup of coffee. That first sip brings a jolt of alertness ‚Äî but a few hours later, the familiar crash hits. Caffeine gives quick energy, but it‚Äôs short-lived, and too much can lead to jitters, anxiety, and even disrupted sleep.

But what if there was a way to get **long-lasting, steady energy** without the side effects? What if that solution wasn‚Äôt a new lab-made formula, but a natural substance that has been used for thousands of years by some of the world‚Äôs healthiest and longest-living cultures?

# Meet the Energy Booster Hidden in the Mountains

High in the rugged peaks of the Himalayas, a dark, tar-like resin seeps from cracks in the rock during the warm summer months. Local communities have gathered and consumed it for centuries, praising its ability to restore stamina, sharpen mental clarity, and improve overall vitality.

For generations, this natural substance was a closely guarded secret, passed down through traditional medicine systems like **Ayurveda**. Only recently has modern science begun to validate its benefits ‚Äî and the results are impressive.

# The Science Behind the Energy Boost

This resin is called [Shilajit](https://naturalherbsshop.com/shilajit), and it‚Äôs rich in **fulvic acid**, **humic substances**, and over **84 essential minerals**. What makes Shilajit unique is how it works at the **cellular level** to support the body‚Äôs natural energy production.

Inside every cell, tiny powerhouses called **mitochondria** create energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Fulvic acid helps your cells use nutrients more efficiently, improves oxygen transport, and speeds up the removal of toxins ‚Äî all of which help your mitochondria produce **steady, sustainable energy** without the spike-and-crash effect of caffeine.

# Coffee vs. Shilajit: The Energy Showdown

|Feature|Coffee|Shilajit|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Energy Type**|Fast, short-lived spike|Steady, long-lasting support|
|**Side Effects**|Jitters, anxiety, crashes|Minimal if taken correctly|
|**Other Benefits**|Mild antioxidant boost|Minerals, immune support, hormone balance|
|**Dependency**|Can lead to tolerance & addiction|Non-habit forming|

# Beyond Energy: Other Proven Benefits

Shilajit isn‚Äôt just for energy. Research has linked it to:

* **Improved brain function** ‚Äî supports memory and mental clarity.
* **Hormonal balance** ‚Äî may help regulate testosterone and estrogen levels.
* **Stronger immunity** ‚Äî boosts the body‚Äôs natural defenses.
* **Anti-aging effects** ‚Äî antioxidant protection and cellular repair.
* **Enhanced workout recovery** ‚Äî supports muscle energy and reduces fatigue.

# How to Use It Safely

If you‚Äôre considering adding Shilajit to your daily routine, here‚Äôs what to keep in mind:

* **Forms Available:** Resin (most potent), powder, or capsules.
* **Dosage:** Typically 300‚Äì500 mg per day for general health, but always follow product instructions.
* **Quality Matters:** Choose a purified, lab-tested product to avoid contaminants.
* **Who Should Avoid It:** Pregnant or breastfeeding women, people with certain medical conditions (check with your doctor).

# What Reddit Users Are Saying

In communities like r/Supplements and r/Nootropics, users have reported:

# Final Thoughts: Would You Make the Switch?

Coffee will always have its place, but if you‚Äôre looking for **natural, sustained energy without the downsides**, this ancient Himalayan resin might just be your new morning ritual.

Hi all!

Me and my partner are in the process of booking a weekend away so are trying to figure out the best option for our fur babies whilst we‚Äôre away and hoping you guys could help us with what service you think would be best for us? 

We have 2 dogs and 1 cat:
- Our Labrador is 8 years old, ball crazy and very chill and calm. She isn‚Äôt overly affectionate but likes to be near you (same room or line of sight). Shes been trained so well and literally never barks and walks perfectly next to us off lead - unless you have a ball in which case she‚Äôll jump at you if you haven‚Äôt thrown it quick enough. She is spayed
- Our Dachshund is exactly like the instagram videos you see. He is a very sweet boy and likes to snuggle with everyone and when he‚Äôs not snuggling he‚Äôs either burrowed under a blanket or people watching out the window. He is very food motivated and will scavenge for food in any bags left unattended - he will also drink your tea/coffee if you leave the room and have it in his reach, won‚Äôt do it if you can see him as he knows it‚Äôs naughty. He has average recall but barks a lot - especially at other dogs. He usually just wants to say hi but he is anxious around big dogs (anything bigger than a lab and it‚Äôs a no go) and has shown aggression towards one of our neighbours dogs after it attacked him and Mulan a few months ago (he holds a grudge). He is becoming more sociable since moving in with the Labrador and loves her so much that he‚Äôs practically glued to her side. He cannot be in the same room as the cat (he‚Äôs too boisterous) and is not neutered 
- Our cat is a beautiful black cat who is a little cat nip fiend and loves to snooze on the sofa, chill in next doors garden or sit on our fence post to tease our Dachshund. If she‚Äôs not in you just have to shake her food and call her name and she will pop up over the fence to come eat and chill with you. She is unsure about the sausage dog yet. She will eat any food left in her reach - doesn‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs in a packet, this gal has been known to rip open a load of bread and unapologetically take a single bite out of every single slice. She is spayed 

The reasons were not sure about a house sit are:

Firstly, we live with my partners sister who theoretically could care for the animals but in practice doesn‚Äôt. Last time she was asked to look after them for an extended period, she only had to look after the cat and the poor cat was sick in the spare room and did a poo on the bed. Her litter box was also full and it seemed she didn‚Äôt make any attempt to clean any of this for the 2 weeks she was meant to be looking after her.
We have tried to ask her to help us with walks/potty breaks when mine and my partners shifts have aligned too much and we couldn‚Äôt let them out for 8 hours. She always forgets so we often had accidents in the house to clean up after work and resulted in hiring a dog walker for all of our shifts after this happened 4 times even with us texting reminders to her.
Because she would be home it might be uncomfortable for a house sitter if we were to go through that option - his sister is lovely but understandably want the house sitter to feel like they can relax and that‚Äôs difficult if an owner is home 

Secondly, we don‚Äôt want to separate the pups but as the sausage is weird with dogs we don‚Äôt want to opt for boarding as it isn‚Äôt fair on the sitter unless they only do 1 family at a time. Our cat would be okay however she is an outdoor cat (we‚Äôre in the UK so it‚Äôs the norm) and if she‚Äôs going to a new place we would want her to be kept inside all day but that means she couldn‚Äôt be boarded with the dogs unless the sitter is set up to separate them constantly: our office is set up with TV and sofa bed so it acts as a second living room for the pups and our actual living room is set up with a stair gate. The downstairs floor is also separated by a stair gate to allow for the cat to wonder when the pups are not down there 

Thirdly, I don‚Äôt want to do just drop ins as it wouldn‚Äôt provide them all with enough attention throughout the day  

I‚Äôm not sure what combo would be best for them all so was hoping some of you lovely sitters could give your thoughts and recommendations? üôèüèª",4,1755247650.0,RoverPetSitting,8,0.84,False

When she plays on her own terms it‚Äôs just messy ‚Äúfun‚Äù play 
Like her pouring her water cup into another cup or finding something to dip into her water cup, she loves collecting stuff in her hand bags and in boxes, running around with her toy mop, playing with her musical wand ect or collecting random things and saying I got you a present 

I wish she wouldn‚Äôt down and read a book, or self imitate and pull out texters and draw on the paper.
Start a tower on her own or attempt to build a train.

She CAN do it but only if I say let‚Äôs ‚Äúdraw, let‚Äôs play doctors let‚Äôs play ect‚Äù

I thought an almost 3 year old would want to pull out her Dollie‚Äôs or her dinosaurs or cars and do make more ‚Äúpretend play‚Äù with her make believe stuff but she doesn‚Äôt.
She lives playing doctors and beauty bag but it HAS to be on me or her only.

Sometimes she will make me an icecream or coffee in her pretend play area and bring it to me but again not always.

I can read documentation (fully understanding is a other thing, not always, but really try not to only CP) My handle with terminal, my bashish is truly ok. I've no real problems with that.

I know a lot of theoretical concepts also in security things, but no one which drinks morning coffee, while reading CVE's (but sometimes manuals :D). I can rude read any programming language and understand, what written, if I concentrate a bit. I've never seriously written C\*, but think can come fast in, cause I know concepts and some tricky things, I've to care about.

A bit offtopic --> vent

>!My old company said, that I had authistic nounces, cause I know so much theoretically, but practically I have lack experience, esp. in corparate linux networks. But how can I ever get this experience, if the special subspecies of Mad German Linux Admins fight their territory with their life...!<  
>!All searching professionals, but don't be ready to integrate new people. No, they give you a doc with a minimal or super outdated infos and think, I can learn alone, how to manage server farm with tools, i've never heared from and get mad, if I ask about that.!<

>!I never saw a Rollout Management or professional monitoring,\[...\], cause of this and always landed to customer support. Now I stopped working, cause I am frustrated of this company culture and miserable paying. I better enjoy my life and exploring penguin distros on my way.!<  
>!Sorry for digressing a bit, but sometimes it must out \^\^'.!<

All in all I am theoretically better than practically and want to balance it out.

So please give more reading stuff. I am hungry! :) I prefer ofc. free online stuff, but for a good books also agree to pay a bit.

1mqs12v,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1mqs12v/i_tried_to_build_a_revolutionary_app_failed_for_2/,"I tried to Build a revolutionary app, failed for 2 years, then pivoted 3 times to build a profitable company","I worked in corporate for four years before taking the startup  plunge. Had what I thought was a brilliant app idea back. Spent two years ""researching"" (aka procrastinating) because I was waiting for everything to be perfect.
Oops, let me first give you some brief of my earlier life basically for your better understanding of my story.
I started this entrepreneurship thing because I am glorized by success/money everyone was talking back then in the internet.

My social media timeline was drowning in the same garbage:

‚Ä¢ Launched a year ago, $50K ARR today!
‚Ä¢ Built a SaaS , VCs are calling!
‚Ä¢ Turned my side project into a unicorn with this one weird trick!

I used to scroll through this stuff thinking I was missing some secret formula. That maybe I just wasn't hustling hard enough.I don't have that entrepreneurship DNA...or it's not in my faith... what not.

Then reality hit me like a freight train when I actually tried building.

When I finally built something, it was trash. Complete garbage that nobody wanted.

But instead of giving up, I did something most people won't: I started talking to actual humans about actual problems they actually had. Not the problems I thought they should have.

Turns out my ""revolutionary"" idea solved a problem that didn't exist. Who would've guessed?

That's when I got obsessed with reading about real founders ‚Äî not the glamourized success stories flooding my timeline, but the messy, honest breakdowns that teaches better than B-Schools.I was digging through actual revenue numbers, documented failures, complete business pivots anywhere I could find them and making some real notes. Best place I kept coming back to as I remember was Y combinator and the Starter Story, and yeah investing in learning (beside stocks) at that stage was honestly the best thing I did except coffee :)

Reading through all of that made me realize something crucial: My first idea wasn't supposed to be perfect. It was just the starting point.


After that previous failure, my business partner and I decided to test a local service idea. We threw up a basic website over a weekend, ran some Facebook ads, and got our first booking within hours and I was shocked!

Sounds like a success story, right? Wrong.

We spent the next month personally handling every single order, driving all over the city, barely breaking even after gas and time. We were glorified Uber drivers pretending to run a tech company.

The turning point wasn't some brilliant insight or viral moment. It was admitting our model was broken and systematically testing different approaches until something worked.

Three pivots and eight months later, we finally found something scalable. Not because we were geniuses, but because we were stubborn enough to keep failing forward.

Two years in, we're profitable across multiple markets. Not because we followed some guru's blueprint, but because we learned to solve real problems for real people.

What actually matters:

Customers don't care about your vision. They care about their problems. Stop building what you think is cool and start solving what people actually need.

Now,before you quit your day job:

Can you clearly articulate the specific problem you're solving and for whom?

Are you prepared for this to take 3-5 years, not 3-5 months?

Do you have enough runway to survive multiple failures and pivots?

The real entrepreneurship isn't posting motivational quotes or revenue screenshots. It's boring stuff like customer interviews, financial modeling, and iterating based on feedback instead of ego.

Stop consuming. Start solving problems.Start investing in Yourself

Everything else will fall into it's place . Have faith .
The dots will connect for sure ...

Unfortunately, ChatGPT has been giving me wrong, misleading, and completely made-up information, so I can‚Äôt rely on it. The official De‚ÄôLonghi website also has very limited technical details.

From the official specs, the biggest difference I can see is that the ECAM610.75.MB is heavier and has two more user profiles.
I still don‚Äôt know which one is better or newer.

ChatGPT even told me that the opposite‚Ä¶that the ECAM612.55.SB is more premium machine because it supposedly has optimized motors and pumps, making it quieter and more reliable, and a better extraction system. It even claimed that:

	‚Ä¢	Additional hot water system (ECAM612.55.SB): Allows simultaneous heating for espresso and milk frothing, supposedly not the case for ECAM610.75.MB.
	‚Ä¢	Motors and pumps: Slightly stronger and optimized for quieter/faster water pumping, improving extraction speed.
	‚Ä¢	Temperature stability: More stable temperature when making multiple coffees in a row.
	‚Ä¢	Premium technical tweaks: Minor improvements in the water tank, heating elements, and piping for faster heat-up times and more consistent temperature.

I have no way to verify if any of this is true, I am in a doubt in Chatgpt.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response‚Äîor lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly‚Äîthe Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me‚Äîan eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

**Response to Prompt 6: Assonance**

Amidst the rolling hills of Harmony Valley, where the soft hum of nature's symphony echoed through the meadows, a mysterious traveler arrived, bringing with them a melody that resonated with the delicate assonance of a forgotten tune. The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed‚Äîa pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

**Response to Prompt 22: Metonymy**

In the political arena of Capital City, where decisions echoed through the corridors of power, a single phrase dominated conversations‚Äîthe ""Iron Throne Statement."" This metonymic expression encapsulated not just a policy decision but the entire narrative of political maneuvering that unfolded within the city's hallowed halls.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a mylar bag hinges on several crucial features that determine its ability to protect the contents from environmental factors. These features include the thickness, material composition, sealing capabilities, and presence of any additional protective layers.Analyzing these attributes is critical to selecting a mylar bag that meets your specific requirements,ensuring long-term preservation and peace of mind.

**Thickness:** Mylar bag thickness is measured in mils (thousandths of an inch) and directly influences the bag's durability and barrier properties. Thicker bags offer greater resistance to punctures,tears,and permeation by gases and moisture. Bags typically range from 3 mils to 7 mils in thickness.

A thicker mylar bag, such as a 5-mil or 7-mil option, is recommended for storing heavier items or items with sharp edges, such as dried pasta or tools. Thinner bags, around 3 mils to 4 mils, are suitable for lighter, less abrasive items like spices or documents. choosing the appropriate thickness will help you extend the life and protection of your valuables.

**Material Composition:** The core of a mylar bag's protective ability comes from the material construction. Most high-quality mylar bags consist of multiple layers. These layers usually consist of polyester,aluminum,and polyethylene.

The polyester layer provides strength and heat resistance, while the aluminum layer acts as the primary barrier against light, oxygen, and moisture. The polyethylene layer is used for heat sealing, creating an airtight closure. The quality of these materials and how thay are laminated together determine the overall effectiveness of the bag.

**Sealing Capabilities:** An airtight seal is crucial for maintaining the protective surroundings inside a mylar bag. The bag's ability to be effectively sealed depends on the material and the sealing technology used. Heat sealing is the most common and reliable method, requiring a consistent temperature and pressure to create a strong, airtight bond.

Look for bags that are specifically designed for heat sealing and consider investing in a quality heat sealer. some bags come with features such as wider sealing surfaces or specialized sealing strips that enhance the airtightness and tamper-evident qualities of the closure.

**Oxygen Barrier:** The ability to prevent oxygen from entering the bag is one of mylar's best qualities, because it slows spoilage and oxidation. The oxygen barrier depends not only on the thickness and the materials, but the integrity of the seals.

Bags with a high oxygen barrier are ideal for storing food items that are prone to oxidation and spoilage, such as nuts, seeds, and dried fruits. Proper heat sealing is essential to maintaining an effective oxygen barrier.

## Core Benefits

Mylar bags offer a multitude of benefits that make them a superior choice for long-term storage and preservation. These advantages stem from their exceptional barrier properties and durability. by effectively shielding contents from environmental factors, mylar bags ensure the longevity and quality of stored items, providing invaluable peace of mind.

**Extended Shelf Life:** The primary benefit of mylar bags is their ability to significantly extend the shelf life of stored goods, especially food items. By creating an airtight and light-proof environment, mylar bags inhibit the growth of mold, bacteria, and other spoilage organisms. This translates to a longer period during which the contents remain fresh,nutritious,and safe for consumption.

For instance,dried beans stored in mylar bags with oxygen absorbers can remain viable for decades,whereas the same beans stored in plastic bags may deteriorate within a few years. This extended shelf life is invaluable for emergency preparedness, long-term food storage, and preserving seasonal harvests.**Protection from Environmental Damage:** mylar bags provide robust protection against a range of environmental factors that can degrade stored items. They act as a barrier against moisture, preventing mold and mildew growth. They block out ultraviolet (UV) light, which can cause discoloration and break down materials over time. Mylar also provides protection from pests and rodents seeking food or shelter.This comprehensive protection is essential for preserving sensitive items like electronics, documents, and artifacts, ensuring their integrity and functionality for years to come.

**Odor Control:** The impermeable nature of mylar bags effectively contains odors,preventing them from escaping and contaminating the surrounding environment.This is particularly useful for storing pungent items like spices, coffee, or medicinal herbs, ensuring that their aromas do not permeate your pantry or storage area. additionally, mylar bags prevent external odors from seeping in and affecting the contents, preserving their original flavor and fragrance.

This odor control benefit is particularly appreciated by those with sensitivities to strong smells or those who wish to maintain a discreet storage environment.

Understanding these aspects is crucial for making an informed purchase and utilizing the bags effectively. Below are answers to some common questions to assist you in your decision-making process.

**Can Mylar Bags be Reused?**

Mylar bags can technically be reused, but it‚Äôs not generally recommended for long-term storage, especially for food. Each use compromises the integrity of the seal and potentially introduces contaminants. If reused, thoroughly inspect the bag for punctures, tears, or creases along the sealing area. If storing non-food items, reuse is more acceptable, but always ensure the bag is clean and undamaged before resealing.

**Are Mylar Bags Safe for Food Storage?**

Yes, mylar bags are generally considered safe for food storage when they are made from food-grade materials. Ensure that the bags you purchase are specifically labeled as ""food-grade"" and that they comply with relevant safety standards and regulations. Also, be sure to use oxygen absorbers to improve the quality and safety of stored food items.**Do I Need to use Oxygen Absorbers with Mylar Bags?**

Oxygen absorbers are highly recommended, especially when storing food items that are susceptible to spoilage or oxidation. Oxygen absorbers remove the oxygen within the sealed mylar bag, creating an environment that inhibits the growth of aerobic bacteria, mold, and insects. This extends the shelf life and preserves the quality of the stored contents. Oxygen absorbers are particularly beneficial for low-moisture foods like grains, beans, and dried fruits.

So I put my location to his city and we matched 3 hours after I left. What a pity. I swiped on him while being there but he saw it later. He works in law and travels often to sign contracts. So spends max 1 one day in a location. And he told me: oh you are not from here.... Well it would be great if you come back, If I have a contract in your city, i will reach out ;) (he put that winky emoji). He asked for my facebook.

So I gave it to him. The first thing I noticed is that on FB he has his real name and on bumble he used a pseudonym. Not a nickname, that would be good. But ""Wind"". Of course I found this weird even before we exhanged SM as it was clear it is not his name lol. I don't know how normal that is for online dating.

Today I put another photo, to test lol. It was a swimwear pic again with a focus on cleavage (nothing vulgar or too revealing though) and he liked it right away. But he is not interested in talking.

Would he be interested in seeing me for a date? This is what he suggested himself. To meet each other if we end up in the same place and maybe have a coffee.
