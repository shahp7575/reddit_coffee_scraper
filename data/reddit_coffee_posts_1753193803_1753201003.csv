[The White Rabbit]

This was rather awkward, and that was putting it lightly.

My professor, who I'd recently found out got the title ""Butcher Ghartok"" in his mercenary days, the Combat Droid (whose name I didn't know, but whose lethality I *did*), Dr. Morrison, a human who had a set of augments that would make *anyone* run, and The Madam, who didn't need augments to be one of the scariest beings I'd ever encountered in the galaxy - a quick search indicated that *nine* tails on on of her kind meant she had lived at least 900 years, and she resembled a predator from my homeworld we had intentionally exterminated millenia ago.

***Then*** there was the human ""Judas Iscariot"", or ""Mr. Scary"", as he preferred to be called, and I knew gray or white hair on a human mercenary's head meant they'd survived countless battles and were *horrible* news. He'd fought alongside and against High Professor Ghartok. And survived.

Somehow, we'd all ended up sleeping in the same room.

I was not getting any sleep tonight. I was just too anxious.

Then The Madam was all over me, asking ""you having a case of nerves?""

""Yes!"" I yelled in her face, ""and you're one of the reasons! You were our main predators on our world!""

""Well damn,"" she said, getting off me, ""I can't apologize for what beings resembling me did so long ago.""

""They usually resembled your true form,"" I told her, and she blushed, ""in this form...""  I said, gazing up into her eyes, colorful ones, not the hateful orbs I'd expected, ""maybe it could work?""

""How about we have a try?"" she asked, ""do you want to be on top, or-""

""I'll take you from behind like the vixen you are!"" I said. It was like needles pierced into my mind: she needed to be shoved down like so many of her kind had done to mine. Well, my method would result in less blood and guts everywhere.

And she had quite literally asked for it. Once I came back to full consciousness an hour later, I was pretty sure she hadn't bargained for that. But she was smiling and making limp attempts to wave her tails, and told me she'd underestimated me.

I *did* sleep that night, wrapped in the arms and legs and tails of a creature all my instincts had screamed at me I should simply run away from. But they had shut up.

""Didn't think *you'd* be the one to get laid tonight,"" High Professor (or Butcher?) Ghartok woke me with.

""Oh go to Hell,"" The Madam hit him with, ""he's a better lay than you.""

""I wasn't saying anything beyond the mere fact I thought he was the least likely to get laid.""

For the first time, I openly defied the High Professor, saying ""look around."" We were definitely not the only ones who'd had a bit of a good time last night. And she had helped me get to sleep.

The silence stretched, a curtain that was watched fall.
Boxes were packed and labeled with a careful hand,
Trying to fit a lifetime in a different land.
The first time names were carved in the old oak tree was remembered,
Now it feels like a hollow reminder of who was used to be.

The night before leaving hung heavy in the air,
A bittersweet symphony, a silent, desperate prayer.
Should someone have stayed, played the part, and pretended it was enough?
But some knots, darling, no matter how you try, just can't be tough.

A flannel shirt was seen draped across the chair.
The smell of coffee on the table was still lingering there.
The urge to call you, to hear your voice one last time, was fought.
But a broken record, honey, always plays the same old rhyme.
This town, these memories, are like threads woven tight.
And leaving you feels like stepping out of a familiar light.

The night before leaving hung heavy in the air,
A bittersweet symphony, a silent, desperate prayer.
Should someone have stayed, played the part, and pretended it was enough?
But some knots, darling, no matter how you try, just can't be tough.

They say home is where the heart is, but the heart is scattered far and wide,
Like faded photographs, or a secret that can no longer be hidden.
Maybe someday the tears will dry, and the regret will fade,
But tonight, in this quiet room, a future's being remade.
And it is hoped you find the kind of love that lets you sleep at night,
While this unknown path is chased, into the pale morning light.

1m6iarf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m6iarf/can_you_drive_around_the_island_of_oahu_in_a_day/,Can you drive around the island of Oahu in a day?,"Just got back from an incredible journey around Oahu, and I wanted to share my experience about circling the entire island in a day. The short answer is yes, you absolutely can - but there's more to consider than just the driving time.

While you could technically drive around Oahu in about 4 hours, that's not the best way to experience the island. I learned this the hard way on my first visit when I tried to do it myself. Between navigating unfamiliar roads, finding parking, and constantly checking Google Maps, I missed out on so many hidden gems.

On my recent trip, I decided to try a different approach. I booked a Circle Island Tour that included Waimea Waterfall, and it completely changed my perspective. Having a local guide made all the difference - they knew exactly where to stop, when to avoid crowds, and shared fascinating stories about Hawaiian culture that I would've never known otherwise.

The tour took us to all the major spots: Diamond Head's breathtaking lookout, the impressive Halona Blowhole, and the historic Nu'uanu Pali where you can literally feel history in the wind. We stopped at Tropical Farms for some amazing Kona coffee (trust me, it's worth it), and the views at Kualoa Regional Park made me feel like I was in Jurassic Park - because I actually was! They filmed parts of it there.

The North Shore was a highlight - we got to try the famous garlic shrimp (bring cash!) and saw professional surfers catching massive waves at Sunset Beach. The Waimea Valley and Waterfall was honestly magical. Pro tip: bring your swimsuit because you can actually swim there.

What really struck me was how much more efficient this was compared to driving myself. No worrying about directions, parking, or missing the best photo spots. Our guide knew exactly where to take us for the best views and experiences.

If you're interested in doing the same tour I did, you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island. It's about 8 hours long and includes all the entrance fees, plus hotel pickup and drop-off. They limit the group size to 24 people, which I found perfect - not too crowded but still social enough to meet interesting people.

Cost-wise, it's actually pretty reasonable when you consider what's included. I paid $154, which covers transportation, guide, and admission fees. When you factor in what you'd spend on a rental car, gas, parking fees, and admission tickets if you did it yourself, plus the stress of driving in an unfamiliar place, it's totally worth it.

Bottom line: Can you drive around Oahu in a day? Yes. Should you? I'd recommend taking a guided tour instead. You'll see more, learn more, and actually get to enjoy the experience rather than stress about logistics.

Just remember to bring:
- Swimming gear if you want to take a dip
- Cash for lunch and souvenirs
- Camera (obviously)
- Comfortable walking shoes
- Sunscreen and water

The tour has a free cancellation policy up to 24 hours before, so you can book now and decide later if your plans change. After doing it both ways, I can confidently say this is the best way to see Oahu in a day.",1,1753200706.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

Let's begin. How did I know I had ADHD?

---

A bit of background (skip it if you want to) :

Since I was a kid I could never sit in one place for more than 2 minutes and I'd roam in circles all round my terrace (and this was way before computers and mobile phones, mind you). Even if I was forced to sit for extended periods (at school and painting classes) I'd constantly stim (which is a repetitive behaviour seen in people with ADHD and autism). My stimming would include shaking my hands and legs under the desk (to the point pencils would roll off the desk and fall on the floor from the vibrations). I'd also never be able to study unless it was the very night before exams and my panic would take over my ADHD and I'd study all night long (yes, I've been pulling all-nighters before y'all could even spell staphylococcus simply because I was incapable of studying the rest of the year).

But till 10th standard, it was no big deal because pre-plus2 academics were quite simple and even though I never got to know I had a disorder (teachers would point out my weird stimming but no one ever encourage me or my parents to check that out with a psychiatrist). I aced my 10th boards by studying the night before (95.06% with all 10 subjects). Imagine. (ICSE, 2020 which means I wrote 8/10 exams offline while the rest were cancelled thanks to COVID)

Enter class 11. This is the year I get shown my f\*cking aukaat. The syllabi are humongous. PCMB + English(Lit, Lang) + Bengali. Physics, biology and the 3 humanities subjects were fine but mathematics and chemistry were killing me. On top of that we had to take those shitty online classes and I cheated my way through those school tests. Fast forward a year and a half of fucking around and now it's time to find out, the october of 2021 rolls in. ALL ISC exams are scheduled to happen offline and in TWO DIFFERENT SHIFTS (December 2021 + March 2022 I think, I forgot). I haven't studied shit and I realise that this time I CANNOT pass by studying the night before. So what do I do? I study the rest of the little time? Nah. I do not. I try, I try like a MF, but I simply CANNOT. I cannot sit. Till 10th, I'd never sat for more than 2 mins willingly. I'm incapable of studying. Days go by. I ask my myself wtf is wrong with me, why can't I bloody sit and study for an hour? Again those dreaded ""nights before"" roll around and I again pull all-nighters and pass somehow in ISC 2022, this time writing all the exams offline. (90.02% but my worst was in chemistry, where not only could I not get anything close to 90, I scraped by with a 77 out of 100).

As I was not quite done screwing myself up, I decided to take a gap year for NEET preparation. HUGE MISTAKE. Don't ask. Wasted money. Could not study. Permanent regret in life. NEET 2023, my one and only attempt, is still lodged in my heart as a sharp, painful dagger. The only good thing that came out of this drop year was the fact that I came to know about ADHD and had a nagging suspicion that I was suffering from it and had been suffering since I was a little kid.

Post NEET trauma, I take admission at Xavier's in...\*wait for it\*... Computer Science Hons. I was pretty good till class 10 and figured I'd study something employable. I liked the papers but again could never study. 4 sems went by with poor SGPAs ( in 6s and 7s). Even disappointing report card after every semester exams would cement the idea that I was indeed suffering from ADHD but coming from a typical Indian family that was ignorant about mental health I could never muster up the courage to go to a psychiatrist. During taking another L from my 4th sem report card, I finally decided to take action.

---

Here's where the story begins :

I searched the entire r/kolkata feed to look for good psychs. After reading a few posts and comments, I zeroed in on a doc who seemed to have the most positive reviews. I looked up the clinic on Google and called them and booked an appointment.

I went to the appointment and the doc and I talked for a lot of time (I had to doll out ₹1000 as consultation fee but worth it). I told him my problems and he kept on asking questions. By the end he and I had made a list of all problems I'd been facing since I was a kid. I still have the list. Let's type it out :

* Fidgeting and stimming and inability to sit still
* Low concentration unless anxious and panicked
* Procrastination to the point the patient even hold in urine for long periods
* Fickle and cannot stick to one task or thought
* Inattention
* Addiction to high doses of caffeine
* Coffee makes me sleepy and calm instead of jittery (usual reaction of neurotypical people to caffeine)

After all this was revealed, the psychiatrist told me to get an official diagnosis of ADHD by a licensed psychologist (these are people who have done an M.Phil in Psychology and are registered by GOI). The psychiatrist also told me to get an ECG and 2 blood tests (TSH and LFT) done.

Again I booked an appointment with the psychologist at that same clinic. She administered the CAARS-Self report test (this one is for adults with no one else to report for them; you can also opt for ones where you take your parents/siblings). It was a 2-hour-long test where she really went deep with questions. By the end, I had an official diagnosis that is applicable anywhere across India. This official diagnosis is the mental health equivalent of getting officially diagnosed with COVID-19 or dengue or malaria.

I finally got back to the psychiatrist with the official diagnosis and the bloodwork and ECG reports. He saw them and finally prescribed me Inspiral 10mg . This is the brand name; the generic name of the chemical compound is methylphenidate (or simply meth, lol). It's a stimulant. The psychiatrist told me that since it is a Schedule X drug in India, access to this medicine is highly restricted and only few pharmacies are willing to jump through hoops to get this protected drug, especially since it has very low demand and hence a rather low profit-to-effort ratio. But there are 3 pharmacies in Kolkata that stock this drug and he wrote down the addresses of those 3 places.

Next day, I went to one of those pharmacies. They made me submit a photocopy of the original prescription (that had the doctor's signature + registered stamp). They too stamped both the original prescription and the photocopy and kept the photocopy with themselves (also logged in my name, phone number, and address in the database). Apparently, they have to keep records for Schedule X drugs in case I start smuggling them and they have to file a case against me lol.

---

Post Medication :

There's nothing much to say. Inspiral is magical for focus. I'd let my results speak for themselves:

>These were my SGPA(s) pre-methylphenidate : 6.50, 7.12, 6.98, 7.56

>This was my SGPA in the 5th semester (post-methylphenidate) : 9.84

Still waiting for my 6th semester report card.

After seeing the address, I was convinced it was a rich person ordering something (lots of mansions out that direction), and it's just ""cereal and creamer"". Even with the $35 tip taken off.. This wasn't a horribly bad offer. I accepted it! 

I began in the breakfast cereal aisle. So much cereal! Like over 40+ bags. My tetris skills were in full flex for this order. I was able to make it all fit in one cart. With room to spare for like 25+ bottles of creamer. 

Not a rich person.. Google maps showed a summer camp. I knew for sure, it couldn't be tip bait. They met me at front gate with a car to unload into. Easy handoff! Done! 

Tldr:customer tipped 10%.It's $350 worth of cereal and coffee creamer. It ended up being for a Summer camp! ",1,1753200419.0,Sparkdriver,1,0.67,False
1m6i65f,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1m6i65f/i_22f_was_talking_to_a_guy_39m_and_now_his_phone/,"I (22F) was talking to a guy (39M), and now his phone has been off for a few days.","There's this guy I met about four years ago. He used to come to my work because our companies occasionally collaborated. He'd visit me about once a month. He always looked at me, stared at me. He even asked my boss about my relationship status. He'd sometimes come up to me for a chat. I knew he was interested, but I was in a relationship. My partner died a year ago from addiction, and I've been single ever since.



So this guy stopped visiting us, and I suddenly thought of him about three weeks ago.



I got his number and called to ask about something related to credit scoring, since he works in the financial industry. We chatted, he asked about my love life. I told him I'd been single since my partner's death, and he said he was getting a divorce but was spending time with his 12-year-old son and would be in town so we could meet up.



It was a light, friendly conversation. There was clearly some attraction between us, though he seemed a bit shy.



I called him last Monday around 8:00 PM to ask about his weekend. He called me on Tuesday, and we talked again about his work and plans with his son. He suggested we grab a coffee just the two of us on Sunday (yesterday) because I mentioned it was my birthday. I told him I wanted to meet up with him, of course, and I was open. He said he wanted to meet up with me too.



He told me he had to go because he had a meeting at work. Then he texted me saying he was ""scared"" and upset. I told him I was fine. He asked if I'd been seeing anyone lately because he didn't want to seem inappropriate. I told him I was single and wanted to get to know him better.



That same day, he called me around 8:00 PM. He was outside a restaurant with some colleagues for lunch. We talked for an hour. He said he was ""crazy about me,"" that he found me very attractive, that he kept asking my boss about me, asking for my number. He asked if I'd be willing to go somewhere with him for three days with my dog (I have a sweet Shih Tzu). I said yes, of course. Then he said, ""Do we have to wait until Sunday? I have a hotel booked until Thursday, but I can leave earlier."" I told him that of course we could meet earlier. He said we could meet tomorrow (Wednesday), that he'd stay at the hotel, and that we'd go out to dinner.



The conversation went very smoothly, and we got along really well. We'd never had the chance to talk this long or get to know each other better before, so I thought it was a good opportunity. He also said he was thinking about me. He mentioned a few details from the past—he told me which jeans I was wearing when he visited our office, or what shoes I was wearing. He also told me that I once got into a black car and drove away, and he followed me, but he didn't find me. (I don't remember this, I didn't know it.) These little details seemed charming to me. It was as if he still remembered. It was as if those moments from a few years ago, when we looked at each other, were still vivid. An illusion, but maybe still vivid. He also texted me about his age, about not looking for ""fun,"" to clarify. When we talked, he said he didn't date prostitutes or girls on the side, that he was professional at work, considering his professional status, and so on.



This conversation took place on Tuesday. On Wednesday, I sent him a text confirming the meeting. The message was green, no iMessage was sent. I thought he was on the train and out of service.

His phone was ""out of service"" all day. I think that number is his private number, for all I know. I was surprised.



Thursday, out of service again.



Friday, no service. I call from a different number and he answers a moment later. He tells me he had a ""serious accident at home and that he'll call later, and also asks if we can meet."" He doesn't call again.



Saturday. He calls me by mistake (on my other number, he didn't save it), saying he's ""at number 20"" (I think he meant the door number or apartment number). I ask which number 20??? what????, and he says, ""Oh my God, I'm sorry.""



He hangs up. His phone is out of service most days. Sometimes he turns it back on to get a signal, but only briefly.



Sunday. His phone was off all day.



I know none of you know WHY he does what he does. But he seemed genuinely interested in me. He seemed really honest and shy in conversations and stuff.



Besides, I think this is the main factor in understanding this story – he once visited our company (3 years ago) while… under the influence of some substance. At least, that's what you could say. I also found his TikTok account (without the videos) and a lot of drug rehab accounts that he follows.



I don't know if he's clean. I don't know anything about it. We haven't talked about it. It could be his past, but I think",0,1753200411.0,confession,7,0.44,False

1m6hzog,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m6hzog/i_signed_up_for_a_paid_sleep_study_i_havent_woken/,I Signed Up for a Paid Sleep Study. I Haven’t Woken Up Since.,"Everything started with a flyer.

“LOOKING FOR PARTICIPANTS: PAID SLEEP STUDY — $2,500 compensation. One overnight stay. No known sleep disorders. Call to apply.”

I was unemployed, behind on rent, living off microwave noodles and fear. Easy money just to sleep? Hell, I didn’t even read the fine print.

I showed up at the address, a medical-looking building off campus that smelled like disinfectant and quiet regret. A woman in scrubs greeted me. Too friendly. Too still. Her badge said “Dr. Ellery.”

She led me down long hallways lit with flickering fluorescents, into a small white room. One bed. One camera. Wires. Electrodes. Air so clean it felt dead.

“Lie down,” she said. “You’ll feel a little pinch. Then, sleep.”

That’s when everything started to go wrong.

I dreamed of a facility.

Not that facility. A different one. Bigger. Darker. Deeper. The walls weren’t white. They were a dull, fleshy pink. Something organic pulsed just beneath the surface, like muscle. Or membrane.

I walked barefoot down a hallway. The floor was warm. Other people were there too, some in hospital gowns, others in regular clothes. None of them spoke. They just stared straight ahead. Wide eyes. Open mouths.

A man in a lab coat walked up to me. His face moved too fast, flickering like an old film reel skipping frames. His voice sounded like static pushed through clenched teeth.

“Welcome to Level One.”

I woke up. Or at least, I thought I did.

The room looked the same. Same bed, same camera. But Dr. Ellery was different. Her smile was... wrong. Too wide. Like her skin had been stitched into place by someone who didn’t quite understand how faces were supposed to work.

“Did you sleep well?” she asked, tilting her head far too much. The angle was unnatural.

“I’m done. I want to leave.” I shot upright.

She blinked once. Then again. But this time, the eyelids moved sideways.

“You’re not finished yet,” she said.

\*\*\*

Every time I ""woke up"", I was in another layer. Each ""room"" felt a little less real than the last. The ceiling rippled like water. The walls breathed. In one version, the bed had veins. In another, the camera blinked at me, literally blinked, like an eye.

They told me I was making progress. That I was doing well.

“No subject has ever made it this far,” one of them said. His voice dripped like molasses slow, syrupy, wrong.

That’s when I realized: They weren’t studying how I slept. They were studying how I dreamed.

And I was sinking layer by layer, deeper into their world. That’s when I started seeing the others — the real ones.

People who’d also signed up for the sleep study. One girl, Sasha, told me she’d been there for weeks. Maybe months.

“They keep us dreaming,” she whispered. “They feed on the transitions. That flicker between sleep and waking. There’s energy in it.”

I asked how we could wake up. She laughed a horrible, empty sound, like something rattling in a dry throat.

“You can’t. Not unless you reach the bottom. But no one knows where that is.”

\*\*\*

One night, if you can even call it night here, I found a mirror. It was cracked. Blurry. But I saw my reflection. My skin was turning gray. My eyes sunken. Something was moving under the surface of my neck, twitching, like a worm squirming just beneath the flesh.

I screamed. The mirror rippled then showed me another version of myself. Smiling. Clean. Perfect. Behind her were the dream researchers. Their faces stretched like melting wax. Mouths open in silent howls.

I shattered the mirror. It bled. That’s when I started fighting back. Refusing to sleep inside the dream. Walking, endlessly, just to avoid the transitions.

They punished me. One level down, they took time away. No day. No night. Just a dull gray light pressing into my skull like a migraine that never ended. In another layer, I heard voices. My mother. My first girlfriend. My own voice. All whispering behind the walls.

They knew my memories. They knew my fears. And they used them. That level broke me.

I collapsed on the floor, sobbing. Whispered:

“Please... I just want to wake up.”

That’s when it happened. The Chief Investigator. He didn’t wear a lab coat. He wore my face. But not exactly,  just enough to feel wrong. The teeth were too long. The smile never moved. The eyes were glassy, blank, no pupils at all.

“You’re doing well,” he said, in my voice. “You’re getting close to Level Zero.”

“What’s Level Zero?” I croaked.

“Wake up,” he said. “If you survive.”

Then he touched my forehead. I screamed. I fell. Crashing through layers, like ice cracking beneath my feet. Flashes of rooms. Colors. Memories. My fifth birthday. My grandfather’s funeral. My first kiss. All of it peeling away, layer by layer, as if I was being stripped down to a raw, dreaming core.

And then—Silence.

Darkness. One word burned into my vision like static etched on a dead TV screen:

LEVEL ZERO

I opened my eyes. I was back. Back in the original unit. Bright lights. The real Dr. Ellery. My clothes neatly folded. A clipboard next to the bed.

“You’ve been under for seven hours,” she said, smiling gently. “How do you feel?”

I broke down in tears. Relief flooded through me like rain after a long, cracking drought. I grabbed her wrist.

“It was horrible,” I said. “I… I thought I was trapped.”

She handed me a cup of water. Said the brain can play strange tricks during sleep. Hypnagogia. Nested dreams. Lucid cycles.

“All perfectly normal.”

\*\*\*

I signed the forms. Took the check. Left that place as fast as I could. I ran all the way home.

That night, I tried not to sleep. Every time I shut my eyes I saw them. The researchers. My reflection. My own face, rotting.

I paced around my room. Drank coffee. Chewed my fingernails until they bled.

But eventually…I passed out.

And I woke up in a room I recognized.

A bed. A camera. A clipboard.

The door opened… and ""Dr. Ellery"" walked in. Only this time, she didn’t even bother wearing skin. Her face was a rotting mess of tentacles and teeth, eyes blinking like barnacles growing out of her skull. Her voice didn’t come from her mouth — it came from everywhere. From inside my ears. My teeth. My bones.

“You reached Level Zero,” she said. “But you never left.”

I screamed. Clawed at the walls. Tried to wake up. Tried to move. Tried to breathe.

Nothing changed. The room stayed still.

The clipboard now read:

Subject: Ethan Cross  
Sleep Study: Phase 3 – Simulated Awakening  
Response: Highly Compliant  
Status: Core Integrity Breached  
Extraction: Denied  
Retention: Indefinite

I wasn’t dreaming anymore. This was real. A reality they built. A prison made of belief. And the worst part?

Every time I think I’ve woken up… There’s another clipboard.

Just now, someone knocked at my apartment door. I answered. A man was standing there, breathless, holding a crumpled flyer.

“Hey,” he said. “Did you… do that sleep study thing?” His hands were shaking. “I can’t wake up.”

I smiled, my mouth opening wider than it should.

“Come in,” I said. “Let me tell you how it starts.”",1,1753200021.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1m6hzlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1m6hzlz/i_saw_him_today_and_im_back_to_square_one/,I saw him today and I'm back to square one.,"He was my son's surgeon. We are both married with kids. I confessed my feelings for him in a cringe-worthy phone call back in February (though, I'm still glad I told him, despite his non-response.)

A few weeks ago I saw him walking his dog and pulled over my car, though thankfully I resisted the urge to get out of my car and approach him.  I had been driving down his street whenever I needed to go to the drugstore. I posted here and received some harsh but necessary comments, and took them on board. I no longer drive down his street whenever I go to the drugstore. I deleted the photos I had of him on my phone.

Today I went to a coffee shop with a friend - not in either of our neighborhoods - and ten minutes after we arrived he walked in with his kids. I saw him but I didn't make eye contact with him. It was a large space with few people so it's likely, but by no means guaranteed, that he saw me. 

I felt sick. I wanted to simultaneously go and speak to him, vomit and run from the building. I did none of the above. Carried on with my friend as ""normal"" though I could barely think straight.

I'm back to square one. My delusion that this isn't over (whatever ""this"" is). When I first met him my marriage was on the verge of ending, so I understand why I became so attached.  My marriage right now is as strong as it's ever been - we've worked on it - but I would still run away with my LO if he so much as gave me a second glance. 

This is absolutely miserable.

- carrot express: it’s the best matcha I’ve had EVER! Super unique creamy texture and and not watery at all (I actually have no idea how they made it so good - maybe they added cream?). I got it with no ice and no sugar! Will definitely go back for my matcha fix. Also the sweet potato is really great! Also quiet and great to do work at! 

 - midtown boba: I like boba so went there twice! Matcha itself is good but amazing with the boba! I got it with whole milk and 0% sugar (boba has some sugar so that still adds some sweetness :)) there’s no seating but you can go to brickell center nearby 

- Crema Gourmet: it was solid and a good portion! The glass jar they serve it in is cute and sustainable. Cafe also has tons of outlets and nice decorations! 

- maman: pretty solid matcha - I’d say the quality is similar to crema gourmet but lower on rankings here since they offer smaller portions. The vibes are really great and cafe is pretty though! 

Rosetta (brickell): super nice store with nice staff but they use premix with sugar - go if you like sweetness but it was too sweet for me - would recommend the coffee instead which is great!

Yesterday I got creative and wrote her a letter and published it on substack. 
Sharing here cause I’m sure some of you will relate. It was honestly a cathartic release 

Even at your best, you still suck
A letter to my PMDD

Sometimes I wish I could go back to the days of not knowing you exist. Back to the days of randomly wanting to blow up my life, yell at my parter, not want to be touched (while desperately wanting comfort)., crying so hard I can’t breathe. I crave that oblivion that allowed me to feel righteous in my suicidal ideation and break up fantasies. Somehow those days didn’t seem so hard. Sure, I was totally out of control. Probably even relapsed a couple of times because of you, but I didn’t know it was you, I thought it was me and maybe somehow that was easier than living with YOU and knowing that you are going to return in some way or another each month until the last egg has popped off one of my ovaries.


It really is your endless returning that makes you such an unmanageable bitch. You show up right on time, though uninvited, each month. Day 14 fuuuuuuck what’s wrong with me? Should I make a doctor’s appointment? I think something is wrong, you have lupus, no maybe it’s not lupus, I should make a doctor’s appointment. Oh my god, why is he breathing so loud….. oh fuck what day is it? Oh my god I fucking ovulated, that’s what this is. Ugh, why did I make that doctor’s appointment. I should go do something relaxing. Why is he still fucking BREATHING so loud? 

Day 16-21 I almost convinced myself you didn’t exist. You were such a quiet considerate visitor that I almost didn’t notice you lurking in the background sneakily sprinkling negativity into my life, but then boom, boy did you make yourself known again. 7 days out from my period you busted down the door with some early morning sadness. The kind of morning where if it had been a work day, I would’ve struggled to go. It was then that I realized I had not in fact miraculously rid myself of your never ending visits, I was only having a “good” month. As I struggled not to cry before my first coffee, I run through all the reasons why this cycle has been easier. Is it the supplements from the naturopath? Which ones? The powder? The pills? The tincture? Who knows? They’re all probably garbage, you know what powder really makes you feel better… fuck off that’s you talking, not me. Maybe it’s all the tools and techniques I’ve learned over the years. I mean acceptance, self compassion, parts work/IFS… fuck, I just realized my manager is in full swing. Was that a psychology joke? oh god, kill me now. Ok, deep breath, drink your coffee, take it easy, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to today. Well, you should probably at least go for walk. 

What’s the point of existence, I don’t have kids, I don’t believe in god. The world is fucked. And there’s a fucking genocide happening, never again my ass. I know this is you talking, but we’re at the point in the month where you and I become one. Where we have all the thoughts that we’ve been having since I was about 11. Like why the fuck are we even here? Joy does not seem accessible. Everyone and everything is annoying. Why can’t I focus? I want to do something, but I also want to rot in bed, but then I’ll feel guilty. These clothes are so fucking uncomfortable and I’m always hot and this empty pit in my stomach is never-ending. I definitely want ice cream and why the fuck are we here? I see our thoughts dancing around in brain coming and going, not even fully formed. I don’t attach or judge, but I also don’t feel any better and definitely shouldn’t have had that last cup of coffee. Ugh how many more days are you fucking here for? 3? Are you kidding 3 more days of this shit. Thank god I have a massage booked for tomorrow. I wonder if you can add SSRIs to SNRIs, but only during luteal, ugh no you don’t need more pills. I should text a friend, no everyone thinks you’re annoying. Why can’t I just make myself go to the gym? How the fuck is Donald Trump the president. 
One day left before you leave and leave me with the sweet sweet relief of blood and cramps. This is usually the perfect time to unknowingly pick a fight with my loving husband who has done so much to understand and accommodate your visits. It’s best to start with some good old fashioned nit picking, but don’t let up, keep going until he gets defensive, then lash out and say something you might regret later. If he even thinks about saying something back, immediately break into tears and cry until you can’t breathe. But we’re not there yet this month.

I consider myself quite cultured for a white Midwesterner, even though I've never left the country, learned a language beyond Pig Latin, or tried many foreign dishes. But if you ask anyone from our side of the trailer park, they'll tell you we were a loud and loving bunch of hippies. My mom did an amazing job of introducing us to different cultures, ideas, races, and religions. The challenge was that there wasn’t much diversity in our area, so we mostly explored these ideas through books, tv, local Native American powwows, and the eclectic and eccentric crowd at Midwestern music festivals.



My mom often visited a quirky little shop called Strawberry Fields, overflowing with patchwork purses, tie-dye t-shirts, Grateful Dead tapestries, and a variety of paraphernalia labeled for “tobacco only.” Most of the time, she would go without all six of us kids, but she always returned with little gifts for each of us. My mom has a knack for finding small and unique treasures. She’s loved surprising us with them for as long as I can remember. It’s her love language. 



Once, she brought me home this little yellow box that was the size of a hotwheels car. It was in the shape of an oval, and had little red and green symbols all over it. She wouldn’t tell me what it was until I opened it. 



There was a little note folded up neatly, so I picked it up off the pile of miniature dolls. The little piece of paper explained how to use them. It read something along the lines of… “Tell all your worries to the worry dolls, place them under your pillow before bed, and when you wake up all of your worries will be gone.”



I remember picking up one of the little dolls, and my heart melted at the sight of them. They were no bigger than the tip of my index finger, and I was about seven years old at the time. They were brightly colored, and they were so different from one another. I was in awe of how unique each of them were. I made sure to let my mom know how grateful I was, and I was ecstatic to use them that night. 



I loved whispering to my little dolls before going to sleep. I didn’t do it every night, but I kept them on a shelf in my room and would pull them down when I felt it necessary. They were so small that they would easily get lost, eaten by pets, broken, etc. So my mom would replace them once every so often. 



I am now twenty-four and I honestly hadn’t thought about them since eighth grade when I decided I was too old for worry dolls. The magic of the dolls had died with the Tooth Fairy, Santa Clause, and the Easter Bunny. Instead of using them to cope with my negative thoughts, I decided it was time to use a diary in their place. 



It wasn’t until I was at one of the local flea markets that I spotted a blue storage tub amongst all the faded baseball cards, random tools, and three decade old Christmas decorations. It had a piece of printer paper duct taped to the front of it that read “$0.50 bin” written with a magnum sharpie.



My curiosity got the best of me, and I made my way over to the bin and crouched down to get a better look. Faded toys, a few crocheted oven mitts, a set of ugly clip-on earrings, and three packages of unopened worry dolls. I felt the nostalgia flood through me and a smile spread across my face. I grabbed all three from the box and paid the vendor $1.50 for the bunch. 



I didn’t need three boxes of worry dolls of course, but I thought it would be a fun surprise for my mom and little sister. We have family dinners most Tuesday nights, so I kept them in my glove box until the next get together. 



They were both happy to see the little dolls again. They didn’t even need to open the box to know what they were, but they did anyway because we loved seeing each unique doll. They opened them up and neatly laid them side by side in a row on the kitchen table. 



There was one with a striped skirt and a purple shirt , another with a blue dress and a yellow poncho, and a few little guys with pants and t-shirts. They all had the same black hair that was made out of sand and black paint, but all uniquely designed. They thanked me for the gifts and we all promised to try them out that night to see if they really worked.



I went home that night and opened my package that had been sitting in the car for two days at this point. I placed the yellow box on the side table next to the bed and stared at it with a sentimental smile as I thought about what I might tell the dolls about. 



I carefully took the lid off, grabbing both sides with my thumb and index finger. I dumped the contents of the box out on the night stand and quickly noticed that something was off. I flinched because I thought whatever was inside was some kind of creature.



I know that sounds crazy, but the meaty sounding thud it made when it hit the wood was disturbing. I just stared at the thing for about thirty seconds to make sure it wasn’t going to move. Slowly, I sat back up and nudged it so that its “face” was upward. This didn’t help my growing anxiety by any means. 



Yea, it resembled a worry doll, but it was thick, dark, and sickly looking. The usual sand and paint that was used for the hair was replaced by a little tuft of what looked like real hair from a human or an animal. Its little outfit was not colorful, but a black cloak that covered its whole body and was made of some woven fabric similar to what is normally used for these kinds of dolls. 



The most disturbing thing was the face. Rather than having eyes and a mouth painted with black ink, it appeared as if someone had hollowed out the features from a piece of ham. The color resembled pale skin, with thin, vein-like patterns running across it. My brow furrowed in confusion and disgust. Why did mine look like that? Both my mom and my sister had completely normal dolls. 



Instead of touching it, I decided to take a picture to send to my sister. I wanted to get her thoughts, and maybe even joke about how creepy it was. I pulled my phone out and opened up the camera. I leaned over the doll and snapped a few pics before switching over to our messages. When I pulled up the photo tab, the pictures I had just taken weren’t there. It was like I had never taken them. 



I backed out to make sure they weren’t in my camera roll and possibly not loading, but they weren’t there either. Not even in my recently deleted. I tried again to take the picture, but this time I did it in the message app. The picture took, but it was really bright, like someone was shining an industrial flashlight at the thing. I still tried to send the picture, but it just kept giving me an error message. 



I gave up, believing my phone needed an update or something, but I was too lazy to check and was honestly more interested in the thing sitting in front of me. I finally decided that it was harmless because it hadn’t moved or anything. It just creeped me out in my quiet house. 



I slowly reached out to grab the doll while unconsciously holding my breath. I brought the doll closer to my face and examined it closer. I remember saying “You’re a creepy little thing,” with a grimace on my face. It was such an odd thing. And I wondered why only my box had one doll that was bigger than normal. 



I thought maybe it was some kind of special edition thing, but realized that would be really weird considering they weren’t necessarily a hot commodity. Who would seek out a special edition worry doll?



I decided it was best to stop asking questions and just try to use the thing, like I had promised my mom and sister. I thought maybe the doll would grow on me eventually, considering I have a soft spot for horror movies and creepy props. 



I set the doll down for a moment to get comfortable under the covers before holding it up in front of me. I thought for a moment and decided I’d just share one worry. It was only one doll after all, and generally you tell one worry to one doll. That’s why they tend to come in groups or pairs. 



I spoke the words out loud, “I just want a fulfilling job.”



I had recently gotten a job as a dental assistant with a well known dental corporation. They paid well over the normal wage for assistants in my area, but the dentist was a terror. I assume they needed to put someone in golden handcuffs so they could keep their turnover rates under control. Doctor Selepka. He was a large and imposing man who was horrible to his patients and his staff. He would grab us by the arm forcefully if we weren’t looking in the mouth at the “right angle”. He would forcefully shove patients' heads back on the chair before doing any exam. Other times he would get in screaming matches with other male patients who wouldn’t put up with his shit.



All that being said, it had only been two months, but I was losing my mind with this disgusting excuse for a man. I came home in tears on a daily basis for a plethora of reasons. This doll thing was worth a shot at least. Even if to just say the words out loud. Speaking your intentions as they say. 



I tucked the oddly textured doll under my pillow and snuggled into bed. It didn’t take long for me to fall into a deep sleep. 



I slept like a rock. It was one of those sleeps that makes you feel like you time traveled to the next day. I woke up in the same position that I fell asleep in, which made my body so sore. 



I rolled out of bed, groaning and rubbing my stiff muscles. I had honestly had enough of this job, and just whispering to the little doll about my worries, kinda made me realize how badly things had gotten. I wasn’t going to quit right now, because I needed the money, but I figured it would be fine to call in for just one day. It was a Friday, so I decided to give myself a three day weekend. My mental health needed a break.



I sent a half hearted excuse about not feeling well and  got a half hearted “feel better” from my manager. I started my morning like any other weekend. Freshen up, Coffee, comfy clothes, Youtube. 



I plopped down on the couch and turned on my favorite podcast before deciding I should call my sister to fill her in on everything. I held down the power button to activate Siri and said, “Call Sissy’s facetime,” I waited for a moment before she answered. The sound of screeching children in the background filled my living room. “Hunter! Stop hitting your brother!” she shouted before turning her attention to me. 



“Sorry, what’s up?” She said with an exhausted smile. 



“Sorry to bug you, I just wanted to tell you about what happened last night. You know those worry dolls I got us?” 



“Yea,”



“Well mine looks super weird,” I said with a nervous giggle. 



“What do you mean?” she asked, raising an eyebrow. 



“There was only one doll and it's really weird looking. It’s bigger than normal and feels fleshy. It looks like something from a horror prop store,” 



“Lemme see,” she said, looking more disturbed than before. 



“I tried sending pics last night but they wouldn’t load, or take. I’ll see if I can get it to work,” I flipped my camera to face the floor as I got off the couch and walked to my bedroom. I grabbed the corner of my pillow and flipped it up for dramatic effect, but paused. The doll was gone. 



My sister didn’t say anything for a second, most likely confused. “Bro I swear to god I put it under my pillow before bed.” 



“Check under your bed or maybe you kicked it under the sheets somehow.” 



I tore my bed apart looking for the silly thing, but there was nothing. “Hey, lemme call you back,” I said before hanging up abruptly. I turned over to my side table and grabbed the little yellow box. It had weight again. “Maybe I put it in here and didn’t remember,” I thought to myself. I took the lid off and was astonished to see a completely new doll sitting inside.



She was dressed in a similar black cloth, but wore a little black flower crown on her head. There was a miniature skull placed right in the center of the crown. Her hair also appeared to be from a living thing, not sure what, but her bangs were much more well kept than the last doll. A straight across cut, each black hair in its place. The thing that really creeped me out was her face. She had the same hollowed out eyes, but her expression wasn’t blank. She was frowning and crying… tears of blood. 



I instinctively lifted my index finger to touch the blood. It was wet. Fresh red blood dripping from her right eye and pooling in the other. I whimpered and set it back down. “What the fuck?” I whispered to myself. 



I couldn’t help but wonder if this was some sort of prank, the only problem with that is, I don’t don’t have many friends outside of my immediate family. My mom has never been into pranks, in fact, she got pretty upset the few times we ever pulled any on her as kids. My sister was busy raising two kids and lived at least forty five minutes away. My other siblings didn’t reach out much, so I was stumped. 



I decided that this must be something supernatural. And I know, most people would look for any other explanation, but like I said before, I was raised around some of the most eccentric people you could imagine. I am a believer in the paranormal at the very least. 



I paced from the living room to the bedroom, periodically checking to see if it moved at all. It stayed put as my mind raced.



 A few moments into my panicked pacing, my phone rang. The caller ID read “Addie,” my boss's name. I rolled my eyes, realizing she was probably going to beg me to come in or something stupid. I answered anyway because I’m a pushover.



“Hey,” I said, trying to mimic a tired, sick person.

 

“Hey girl,” the sounds of smacking gum violated my ears, “something crazy just happened.” My brow furrowed in confusion although I knew she couldn’t see it. 



“What?” 



“Dr. Salepka died this morning,” she stated bluntly, as if she was telling me what she ate for lunch. 



“What? What-How?” I sputtered in shock.



“Jane found him in his pool. Apparently it was pretty bad. His guts were everywhere like an animal attack or something,”



Jane was the dental hygienist that the doctor had been hooking up with in “private” but it was no secret. They rode to work together every morning and went out for drinks nearly every night. 



“Oh my god… that’s insane Addie. Is Jane okay?” I asked, very concerned about her mental state after seeing something so gruesome. 



“She was pretty freaked out when she called me, but she said she’s still coming in on Monday,” I scoffed at her disregard for the situation. 



“Okay Addie, I’m still not feeling well so I’m gonna go rest up so I can be there Monday too,” I retorted passive aggressively knowing she wouldn’t even catch it. I hung up before she could respond and sat down on the couch with my head in my hands. 



Images of Dr. Salepka’s dead body kept flashing in my mind. I hadn’t seen it of course, but my mind painted me a pretty vivid picture regardless of if I wanted to see it. I hated the man with a burning passion, but this was insane. My mind couldn’t help but wonder if the doll had played a part in this or if it was just some crazy coincidence. I decided it was the latter. 



Before I went to sleep that night, I decided to put the lid back on the box. I placed it on the top of my bookshelf. Out of sight, out of mind. 



That night I had some of the most vivid dreams I had ever experienced in my life. They all related to yesterday's events, but it was in such a positive light. I dreamt about what work might be like without him around. I imagined how much anger and negativity had left the world with just one person. It made me feel… happy.The whole time it felt like I had taken ecstasy. It was an intoxicating feeling that I was honestly sad to wake up from. 



When I woke up that morning, I felt so refreshed. Like someone had washed my brain with sunshine and cool water. I smiled as I did my weekend, morning routine and found myself humming and bouncing around the house. 



When I turned the TV on to youtube, I saw one of my favorite True Crime channels had posted a video. Something about the title made me remember what had happened the day before. My heart sank for half a second, but it dissipated quickly. It’s like my brain knew it didn’t want to feel sorry. A part of me felt like it was my fault, and I was somehow proud of it. It makes my skin crawl just thinking about it now. 



As of now, I will keep the doll on the shelf until I get some suggestions as to what I should do.  Does anyone have experience with these specific types of dolls? I’ll link some drawings I made of the dolls so you can get an idea of what they look like. Any advice would be appreciated, so thank you in advance. Until next time.

I couldn’t help but wonder if this was some sort of prank, the only problem with that is, I don’t don’t have many friends outside of my immediate family. My mom has never been into pranks, in fact, she got pretty upset the few times we ever pulled any on her as kids. My sister was busy raising two kids and lived at least forty five minutes away. My other siblings didn’t reach out much, so I was stumped. 



I decided that this must be something supernatural. And I know, most people would look for any other explanation, but like I said before, I was raised around some of the most eccentric people you could imagine. I am a believer in the paranormal at the very least. 



I paced from the living room to the bedroom, periodically checking to see if it moved at all. It stayed put as my mind raced.



 A few moments into my panicked pacing, my phone rang. The caller ID read “Addie,” my boss's name. I rolled my eyes, realizing she was probably going to beg me to come in or something stupid. I answered anyway because I’m a pushover.



“Hey,” I said, trying to mimic a tired, sick person.

 

“Hey girl,” the sounds of smacking gum violated my ears, “something crazy just happened.” My brow furrowed in confusion although I knew she couldn’t see it. 



“What?” 



“Dr. Salepka died this morning,” she stated bluntly, as if she was telling me what she ate for lunch. 



“What? What-How?” I sputtered in shock.



“Jane found him in his pool. Apparently it was pretty bad. His guts were everywhere like an animal attack or something,”



Jane was the dental hygienist that the doctor had been hooking up with in “private” but it was no secret. They rode to work together every morning and went out for drinks nearly every night. 



“Oh my god… that’s insane Addie. Is Jane okay?” I asked, very concerned about her mental state after seeing something so gruesome. 



“She was pretty freaked out when she called me, but she said she’s still coming in on Monday,” I scoffed at her disregard for the situation. 



“Okay Addie, I’m still not feeling well so I’m gonna go rest up so I can be there Monday too,” I retorted passive aggressively knowing she wouldn’t even catch it. I hung up before she could respond and sat down on the couch with my head in my hands. 



Images of Dr. Salepka’s dead body kept flashing in my mind. I hadn’t seen it of course, but my mind painted me a pretty vivid picture regardless of if I wanted to see it. I hated the man with a burning passion, but this was insane. My mind couldn’t help but wonder if the doll had played a part in this or if it was just some crazy coincidence. I decided it was the latter. 



Before I went to sleep that night, I decided to put the lid back on the box. I placed it on the top of my bookshelf. Out of sight, out of mind. 



That night I had some of the most vivid dreams I had ever experienced in my life. They all related to yesterday's events, but it was in such a positive light. I dreamt about what work might be like without him around. I imagined how much anger and negativity had left the world with just one person. It made me feel… happy.The whole time it felt like I had taken ecstasy. It was an intoxicating feeling that I was honestly sad to wake up from. 



When I woke up that morning, I felt so refreshed. Like someone had washed my brain with sunshine and cool water. I smiled as I did my weekend, morning routine and found myself humming and bouncing around the house. 



When I turned the TV on to youtube, I saw one of my favorite True Crime channels had posted a video. Something about the title made me remember what had happened the day before. My heart sank for half a second, but it dissipated quickly. It’s like my brain knew it didn’t want to feel sorry. A part of me felt like it was my fault, and I was somehow proud of it. It makes my skin crawl just thinking about it now. 



As of now, I will keep the doll on the shelf until I get some suggestions as to what I should do.  Does anyone have experience with these specific types of dolls? I’ll link some drawings I made of the dolls so you can get an idea of what they look like. Any advice would be appreciated, so thank you in advance. Until next time.

“LOOKING FOR PARTICIPANTS: PAID SLEEP STUDY — $2,500 compensation. One overnight stay. No known sleep disorders. Call to apply.”

I was unemployed, behind on rent, living off microwave noodles and fear. Easy money just to sleep? Hell, I didn’t even read the fine print.

I showed up at the address, a medical-looking building off campus that smelled like disinfectant and quiet regret. A woman in scrubs greeted me. Too friendly. Too still. Her badge said “Dr. Ellery.”

She led me down long hallways lit with flickering fluorescents, into a small white room. One bed. One camera. Wires. Electrodes. Air so clean it felt dead.

“Lie down,” she said. “You’ll feel a little pinch. Then, sleep.”

That’s when everything started to go wrong.

I dreamed of a facility.

Not that facility. A different one. Bigger. Darker. Deeper. The walls weren’t white. They were a dull, fleshy pink. Something organic pulsed just beneath the surface, like muscle. Or membrane.

I walked barefoot down a hallway. The floor was warm. Other people were there too, some in hospital gowns, others in regular clothes. None of them spoke. They just stared straight ahead. Wide eyes. Open mouths.

A man in a lab coat walked up to me. His face moved too fast, flickering like an old film reel skipping frames. His voice sounded like static pushed through clenched teeth.

“Welcome to Level One.”

I woke up. Or at least, I thought I did.

The room looked the same. Same bed, same camera. But Dr. Ellery was different. Her smile was... wrong. Too wide. Like her skin had been stitched into place by someone who didn’t quite understand how faces were supposed to work.

“Did you sleep well?” she asked, tilting her head far too much. The angle was unnatural.

“I’m done. I want to leave.” I shot upright.

She blinked once. Then again. But this time, the eyelids moved sideways.

“You’re not finished yet,” she said.

\*\*\*

Every time I ""woke up"", I was in another layer. Each ""room"" felt a little less real than the last. The ceiling rippled like water. The walls breathed. In one version, the bed had veins. In another, the camera blinked at me, literally blinked, like an eye.

They told me I was making progress. That I was doing well.

“No subject has ever made it this far,” one of them said. His voice dripped like molasses slow, syrupy, wrong.

That’s when I realized: They weren’t studying how I slept. They were studying how I dreamed.

And I was sinking layer by layer, deeper into their world. That’s when I started seeing the others — the real ones.

People who’d also signed up for the sleep study. One girl, Sasha, told me she’d been there for weeks. Maybe months.

“They keep us dreaming,” she whispered. “They feed on the transitions. That flicker between sleep and waking. There’s energy in it.”

I asked how we could wake up. She laughed a horrible, empty sound, like something rattling in a dry throat.

“You can’t. Not unless you reach the bottom. But no one knows where that is.”

\*\*\*

One night, if you can even call it night here, I found a mirror. It was cracked. Blurry. But I saw my reflection. My skin was turning gray. My eyes sunken. Something was moving under the surface of my neck, twitching, like a worm squirming just beneath the flesh.

I screamed. The mirror rippled then showed me another version of myself. Smiling. Clean. Perfect. Behind her were the dream researchers. Their faces stretched like melting wax. Mouths open in silent howls.

I shattered the mirror. It bled. That’s when I started fighting back. Refusing to sleep inside the dream. Walking, endlessly, just to avoid the transitions.

They punished me. One level down, they took time away. No day. No night. Just a dull gray light pressing into my skull like a migraine that never ended. In another layer, I heard voices. My mother. My first girlfriend. My own voice. All whispering behind the walls.

They knew my memories. They knew my fears. And they used them. That level broke me.

I collapsed on the floor, sobbing. Whispered:

“Please... I just want to wake up.”

That’s when it happened. The Chief Investigator. He didn’t wear a lab coat. He wore my face. But not exactly,  just enough to feel wrong. The teeth were too long. The smile never moved. The eyes were glassy, blank, no pupils at all.

“You’re doing well,” he said, in my voice. “You’re getting close to Level Zero.”

“What’s Level Zero?” I croaked.

“Wake up,” he said. “If you survive.”

Then he touched my forehead. I screamed. I fell. Crashing through layers, like ice cracking beneath my feet. Flashes of rooms. Colors. Memories. My fifth birthday. My grandfather’s funeral. My first kiss. All of it peeling away, layer by layer, as if I was being stripped down to a raw, dreaming core.

And then—Silence.

Darkness. One word burned into my vision like static etched on a dead TV screen:

LEVEL ZERO

I opened my eyes. I was back. Back in the original unit. Bright lights. The real Dr. Ellery. My clothes neatly folded. A clipboard next to the bed.

“You’ve been under for seven hours,” she said, smiling gently. “How do you feel?”

I broke down in tears. Relief flooded through me like rain after a long, cracking drought. I grabbed her wrist.

“It was horrible,” I said. “I… I thought I was trapped.”

She handed me a cup of water. Said the brain can play strange tricks during sleep. Hypnagogia. Nested dreams. Lucid cycles.

“All perfectly normal.”

\*\*\*

I signed the forms. Took the check. Left that place as fast as I could. I ran all the way home.

That night, I tried not to sleep. Every time I shut my eyes I saw them. The researchers. My reflection. My own face, rotting.

I paced around my room. Drank coffee. Chewed my fingernails until they bled.

But eventually…I passed out.

And I woke up in a room I recognized.

A bed. A camera. A clipboard.

The door opened… and ""Dr. Ellery"" walked in. Only this time, she didn’t even bother wearing skin. Her face was a rotting mess of tentacles and teeth, eyes blinking like barnacles growing out of her skull. Her voice didn’t come from her mouth — it came from everywhere. From inside my ears. My teeth. My bones.

“You reached Level Zero,” she said. “But you never left.”

I screamed. Clawed at the walls. Tried to wake up. Tried to move. Tried to breathe.

Nothing changed. The room stayed still.

The clipboard now read:

Subject: Ethan Cross  
Sleep Study: Phase 3 – Simulated Awakening  
Response: Highly Compliant  
Status: Core Integrity Breached  
Extraction: Denied  
Retention: Indefinite

I wasn’t dreaming anymore. This was real. A reality they built. A prison made of belief. And the worst part?

Every time I think I’ve woken up… There’s another clipboard.

Just now, someone knocked at my apartment door. I answered. A man was standing there, breathless, holding a crumpled flyer.

“Hey,” he said. “Did you… do that sleep study thing?” His hands were shaking. “I can’t wake up.”

I smiled, my mouth opening wider than it should.

“Come in,” I said. “Let me tell you how it starts.”",2,1753199677.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1m6htwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1m6htwc/these_worry_dolls_are_plotting_my_demise/,These Worry Dolls are Plotting my Demise,"

I consider myself quite cultured for a white Midwesterner, even though I've never left the country, learned a language beyond Pig Latin, or tried many foreign dishes. But if you ask anyone from our side of the trailer park, they'll tell you we were a loud and loving bunch of hippies. My mom did an amazing job of introducing us to different cultures, ideas, races, and religions. The challenge was that there wasn’t much diversity in our area, so we mostly explored these ideas through books, tv, local Native American powwows, and the eclectic and eccentric crowd at Midwestern music festivals.



My mom often visited a quirky little shop called Strawberry Fields, overflowing with patchwork purses, tie-dye t-shirts, Grateful Dead tapestries, and a variety of paraphernalia labeled for “tobacco only.” Most of the time, she would go without all six of us kids, but she always returned with little gifts for each of us. My mom has a knack for finding small and unique treasures. She’s loved surprising us with them for as long as I can remember. It’s her love language. 



Once, she brought me home this little yellow box that was the size of a hotwheels car. It was in the shape of an oval, and had little red and green symbols all over it. She wouldn’t tell me what it was until I opened it. 



There was a little note folded up neatly, so I picked it up off the pile of miniature dolls. The little piece of paper explained how to use them. It read something along the lines of… “Tell all your worries to the worry dolls, place them under your pillow before bed, and when you wake up all of your worries will be gone.”



I remember picking up one of the little dolls, and my heart melted at the sight of them. They were no bigger than the tip of my index finger, and I was about seven years old at the time. They were brightly colored, and they were so different from one another. I was in awe of how unique each of them were. I made sure to let my mom know how grateful I was, and I was ecstatic to use them that night. 



I loved whispering to my little dolls before going to sleep. I didn’t do it every night, but I kept them on a shelf in my room and would pull them down when I felt it necessary. They were so small that they would easily get lost, eaten by pets, broken, etc. So my mom would replace them once every so often. 



I am now twenty-four and I honestly hadn’t thought about them since eighth grade when I decided I was too old for worry dolls. The magic of the dolls had died with the Tooth Fairy, Santa Clause, and the Easter Bunny. Instead of using them to cope with my negative thoughts, I decided it was time to use a diary in their place. 



It wasn’t until I was at one of the local flea markets that I spotted a blue storage tub amongst all the faded baseball cards, random tools, and three decade old Christmas decorations. It had a piece of printer paper duct taped to the front of it that read “$0.50 bin” written with a magnum sharpie.



My curiosity got the best of me, and I made my way over to the bin and crouched down to get a better look. Faded toys, a few crocheted oven mitts, a set of ugly clip-on earrings, and three packages of unopened worry dolls. I felt the nostalgia flood through me and a smile spread across my face. I grabbed all three from the box and paid the vendor $1.50 for the bunch. 



I didn’t need three boxes of worry dolls of course, but I thought it would be a fun surprise for my mom and little sister. We have family dinners most Tuesday nights, so I kept them in my glove box until the next get together. 



They were both happy to see the little dolls again. They didn’t even need to open the box to know what they were, but they did anyway because we loved seeing each unique doll. They opened them up and neatly laid them side by side in a row on the kitchen table. 



There was one with a striped skirt and a purple shirt , another with a blue dress and a yellow poncho, and a few little guys with pants and t-shirts. They all had the same black hair that was made out of sand and black paint, but all uniquely designed. They thanked me for the gifts and we all promised to try them out that night to see if they really worked.



I went home that night and opened my package that had been sitting in the car for two days at this point. I placed the yellow box on the side table next to the bed and stared at it with a sentimental smile as I thought about what I might tell the dolls about. 



I carefully took the lid off, grabbing both sides with my thumb and index finger. I dumped the contents of the box out on the night stand and quickly noticed that something was off. I flinched because I thought whatever was inside was some kind of creature.



I know that sounds crazy, but the meaty sounding thud it made when it hit the wood was disturbing. I just stared at the thing for about thirty seconds to make sure it wasn’t going to move. Slowly, I sat back up and nudged it so that its “face” was upward. This didn’t help my growing anxiety by any means. 



Yea, it resembled a worry doll, but it was thick, dark, and sickly looking. The usual sand and paint that was used for the hair was replaced by a little tuft of what looked like real hair from a human or an animal. Its little outfit was not colorful, but a black cloak that covered its whole body and was made of some woven fabric similar to what is normally used for these kinds of dolls. 



The most disturbing thing was the face. Rather than having eyes and a mouth painted with black ink, it appeared as if someone had hollowed out the features from a piece of ham. The color resembled pale skin, with thin, vein-like patterns running across it. My brow furrowed in confusion and disgust. Why did mine look like that? Both my mom and my sister had completely normal dolls. 



Instead of touching it, I decided to take a picture to send to my sister. I wanted to get her thoughts, and maybe even joke about how creepy it was. I pulled my phone out and opened up the camera. I leaned over the doll and snapped a few pics before switching over to our messages. When I pulled up the photo tab, the pictures I had just taken weren’t there. It was like I had never taken them. 



I backed out to make sure they weren’t in my camera roll and possibly not loading, but they weren’t there either. Not even in my recently deleted. I tried again to take the picture, but this time I did it in the message app. The picture took, but it was really bright, like someone was shining an industrial flashlight at the thing. I still tried to send the picture, but it just kept giving me an error message. 



I gave up, believing my phone needed an update or something, but I was too lazy to check and was honestly more interested in the thing sitting in front of me. I finally decided that it was harmless because it hadn’t moved or anything. It just creeped me out in my quiet house. 



I slowly reached out to grab the doll while unconsciously holding my breath. I brought the doll closer to my face and examined it closer. I remember saying “You’re a creepy little thing,” with a grimace on my face. It was such an odd thing. And I wondered why only my box had one doll that was bigger than normal. 



I thought maybe it was some kind of special edition thing, but realized that would be really weird considering they weren’t necessarily a hot commodity. Who would seek out a special edition worry doll?



I decided it was best to stop asking questions and just try to use the thing, like I had promised my mom and sister. I thought maybe the doll would grow on me eventually, considering I have a soft spot for horror movies and creepy props. 



I set the doll down for a moment to get comfortable under the covers before holding it up in front of me. I thought for a moment and decided I’d just share one worry. It was only one doll after all, and generally you tell one worry to one doll. That’s why they tend to come in groups or pairs. 



I spoke the words out loud, “I just want a fulfilling job.”



I had recently gotten a job as a dental assistant with a well known dental corporation. They paid well over the normal wage for assistants in my area, but the dentist was a terror. I assume they needed to put someone in golden handcuffs so they could keep their turnover rates under control. Doctor Selepka. He was a large and imposing man who was horrible to his patients and his staff. He would grab us by the arm forcefully if we weren’t looking in the mouth at the “right angle”. He would forcefully shove patients' heads back on the chair before doing any exam. Other times he would get in screaming matches with other male patients who wouldn’t put up with his shit.



All that being said, it had only been two months, but I was losing my mind with this disgusting excuse for a man. I came home in tears on a daily basis for a plethora of reasons. This doll thing was worth a shot at least. Even if to just say the words out loud. Speaking your intentions as they say. 



I tucked the oddly textured doll under my pillow and snuggled into bed. It didn’t take long for me to fall into a deep sleep. 



I slept like a rock. It was one of those sleeps that makes you feel like you time traveled to the next day. I woke up in the same position that I fell asleep in, which made my body so sore. 



I rolled out of bed, groaning and rubbing my stiff muscles. I had honestly had enough of this job, and just whispering to the little doll about my worries, kinda made me realize how badly things had gotten. I wasn’t going to quit right now, because I needed the money, but I figured it would be fine to call in for just one day. It was a Friday, so I decided to give myself a three day weekend. My mental health needed a break.



I sent a half hearted excuse about not feeling well and  got a half hearted “feel better” from my manager. I started my morning like any other weekend. Freshen up, Coffee, comfy clothes, Youtube. 



I plopped down on the couch and turned on my favorite podcast before deciding I should call my sister to fill her in on everything. I held down the power button to activate Siri and said, “Call Sissy’s facetime,” I waited for a moment before she answered. The sound of screeching children in the background filled my living room. “Hunter! Stop hitting your brother!” she shouted before turning her attention to me. 



“Sorry, what’s up?” She said with an exhausted smile. 



“Sorry to bug you, I just wanted to tell you about what happened last night. You know those worry dolls I got us?” 



“Yea,”



“Well mine looks super weird,” I said with a nervous giggle. 



“What do you mean?” she asked, raising an eyebrow. 



“There was only one doll and it's really weird looking. It’s bigger than normal and feels fleshy. It looks like something from a horror prop store,” 



“Lemme see,” she said, looking more disturbed than before. 



“I tried sending pics last night but they wouldn’t load, or take. I’ll see if I can get it to work,” I flipped my camera to face the floor as I got off the couch and walked to my bedroom. I grabbed the corner of my pillow and flipped it up for dramatic effect, but paused. The doll was gone. 



My sister didn’t say anything for a second, most likely confused. “Bro I swear to god I put it under my pillow before bed.” 



“Check under your bed or maybe you kicked it under the sheets somehow.” 



I tore my bed apart looking for the silly thing, but there was nothing. “Hey, lemme call you back,” I said before hanging up abruptly. I turned over to my side table and grabbed the little yellow box. It had weight again. “Maybe I put it in here and didn’t remember,” I thought to myself. I took the lid off and was astonished to see a completely new doll sitting inside.



She was dressed in a similar black cloth, but wore a little black flower crown on her head. There was a miniature skull placed right in the center of the crown. Her hair also appeared to be from a living thing, not sure what, but her bangs were much more well kept than the last doll. A straight across cut, each black hair in its place. The thing that really creeped me out was her face. She had the same hollowed out eyes, but her expression wasn’t blank. She was frowning and crying… tears of blood. 



I instinctively lifted my index finger to touch the blood. It was wet. Fresh red blood dripping from her right eye and pooling in the other. I whimpered and set it back down. “What the fuck?” I whispered to myself. 



I couldn’t help but wonder if this was some sort of prank, the only problem with that is, I don’t don’t have many friends outside of my immediate family.

1m6hsqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1m6hsqg/explore_the_aquaboon_grooved_sediment_water/,Explore the Aquaboon Grooved Sediment Water Filter Review for Home Filtration Needs,"**Personal Experience with the Aquaboon AB-SGR5M 5 Micron Water Filter**

Using the Aquaboon AB-SGR5M 5 Micron Grooved Sediment Water Filter has been an interesting journey for me and my family. We have been testing it over the past four months, consistently putting it to use in our household's whole-home water filtration system. It was time for a replacement filter, and this grooved design caught my eye due to promises of extended filtration capabilities and its compatibility with major brands like Whirlpool and Pentek. I decided to give it a go, and here is how it held up in real-life usage.

**Practical Design and Build Quality**

The polypropylene material of this replacement water filter feels incredibly sturdy yet lightweight, weighing only about 1.58 pounds. I appreciated the durable thermally bonded construction, which left me assured that no solvents or binders would compromise water safety. Its grooved sediment design is arguably the highlight here (from what I’ve read, too), as it increases the surface area of the filter. While it may not sound like much on paper, this innovation truly extends the filter's efficiency by holding more contaminants. As a busy individual, fewer replacements mean more convenience for me and less hassle with maintenance.

**Ease of Installation**

If you’re like me and shy away from complex installations, this product delivers simplicity. Compatible with most 10-inch filter housings (I personally used it in an American Plumber setup), the installation took under 10 minutes without needing tools. The tight universal fit worked seamlessly within my system, proving it lives up to the compatibility claims in its specification. 

[Check Aquaboon AB-SGR5M price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b01ly0imkh/)

**Performance: Does It Live Up to the Hype?**

The performance of this grooved sediment filter impressed my household from the first week of use. Rated at 5 microns, it effectively filtered out noticeable impurities like rust, sand, and dirt from our well water. It’s particularly important because we often experienced clogged faucets in the past. With this in place, not only has the water clarity vastly improved, but I’ve noticed less sediment accumulating in our plumbing and appliances. It's a small relief knowing our washing machine and coffee maker aren’t dealing with unnecessary wear and tear anymore. Plus, filters like this work to prolong the life of the entire filtration system.

**Upsides**

- Long-lasting performance; each filter sustains up to 4–6 months of usage.  
- Grooved design efficiently captures contaminants while maximizing dirt-holding capacity.  
- Made for safe filtration: no binders, solvents, or antistatic additives.  
- Universal compatibility makes it highly versatile in various filtration systems.  

**Bad Points**

- The product doesn’t come with any marking for ""top"" or ""bottom,"" which might confuse first-time users.  
- It seemed less effective at filtering out extremely fine particles like cloudiness compared to higher-end filters.  
- Could include better installation guidance, although straightforward, it left first-timers like one of my relatives double-checking steps online.  

**Alternatives to Consider**

In this market segment, you’ll find several competing brands producing similar 10-inch sediment filters. For instance, Pentek's 155749-43 model or the Whirlpool WHKF-GD05 are worthy rivals. Both these products are comparable in performance but might edge slightly ahead in premium particle filtration, specifically for municipal water users. On the affordability front though, the Aquaboon grooved filter wins by a mile, especially when bought in a convenient 6-pack.

The Hydronix SGC-25-1001 is another good option and caters to households prioritizing chlorine aftertaste removal, which this one does not address adequately. That said, the Aquaboon works best in sediment-heavy environments like homes using well water, where grooved filtration shines by mitigating larger contaminant loads. 

**Worth Every Penny or Not?**

When it comes to affordability paired with solid performance, this filter fits the bill. Its cost-efficiency is particularly evident when bundled packs are purchased, significantly reducing the per-filter expense over time. Compared to premium brands offering marginal differences in durability, this product is definitely a smart economic choice without sacrificing basic performance benchmarks. If you have a well water setup at home and want convenience coupled with practicality, this is a surprisingly fitting contender.

1m6hsbn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m6hsbn,A Student’s Tale,"Two months ago after unboxing our new Breville, my son (a passionate young fellow who, at 11, isn’t allowed to drink a whole coffee yet but can’t get enough of the process and experience) and I struggled mightily for several hours pulling shot after shot of catastrophic failure.  We had decided to try a single shot first, using the built in grinder single shot button and the automatic single shot extraction button.  It was a disaster both by metric of no pressure generating on the gauge and by literal results in the cup.  Gross.  Terrible.  Fail.  After multiple hours of desperate reading and internet scouring, we finally discovered our unit had come with a double filter basket installed.  Ironically both my son and I consider ourselves at least mildly intelligent.  It was both humbling and inspiring to start our journey this way.  We’d developed respect for the art nearly in an instant…

Over time we’ve gotten smarter, and more skilled, and more versed in how different flavors come out of different beans.  Truly glorious flavors indeed.  And I’m recounting this tale because I read of others struggling at first, or with new equipment, and the generous and benevolent folks on this sub fall over themselves to help and reassure that, in time, you’ll figure this out.  Then, it becomes about discovery and enjoyment.

My 2 month advice is as follows.  Beauty and flavor come from consistency.  Use a scale and timer for your pulls.  Measure your doses.  Tamp and distribute the same way.  If you have a Breville machine, run everything in manual mode.  Get control of the pieces.  A distribution and tamper are worthy investments.  However, the biggest boost to our success here is probably the least expensive accessory you can acquire and from what I understand is a relatively new invention.  Yup, the puck screen.  Ours is a .8 but you choose the thickness and make sure it has headspace.  It has improved our consistency almost exponentially.  I’d swear by it.

Anyway, hope this helps someone.  Pull on, my friends.",0,1753199557.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

He brought home another girl who called him “brother.”

With deliberate care, I handed him thers. 

making sure the hidden medical report stayed concealed. 

My eyes, drooping, refused to meet his gaze. 

said coldly, “If I make you sick, then let’s just stop being siblings. From now on, you won’t have a disgusting sister like me to bother you anymore.” After what felt like an eternity of tomb–like silence, the agreement I handed over was violently swept to the floor. 

Half the force from his hand landed on my hand. 

For a moment, my vision swam with dizziness, but I clenched my teeth and managed to stay upright. 

Elbert’s voice, laced with fury and utter disappointment, sounded in my ears. “Pandora, you’ve gone too far this time! Do you really think I’d beg you to stay?!” 

I sneered and forced myself to meet his gaze, flashing a taunting smile. “Who knows? Maybe you’ll end up begging me to stay.” 

As expected, his face darkened completely. 

The last trace of affection vanished from his eyes, leaving only cold indifference and undisguised disgust. 

I turned around and went upstairs to pack my things. 

After I gathered a few clothes and got ready to leave, my gaze lingered on the family portrait atop the nightstand. 

It was taken when Mom and Dad were still alive–all four of us together. 

I was just four years old in that photo. 

Mom, Dad, and Elbert were all smiling at me, while I grinned foolishly at the camera. 

Back then, Elbert was still that kind and gentle big brother. 

Unlike now–it’d been years 

since he last smiled at me like that. 

This journey was likely my farewell. 

After a moment of inner struggle, I turned back and carefully tucked the family photo into my suitcase. 

The oversized suitcase made my descent down the stairs a clumsy spectacle, my strained movements bordering on ridiculous. 

The housekeeper stood at the bottom, halfway extending a hand to help. 

But after a quick glance at Elbert’s thunderous expression, she lowered her head and pretended not to notice me. 

I dragged my suitcase downstairs. 

Even that short distance left my forehead drenched in cold sweat, 

Elbert wouldn’t even look at me. 

He sat on the sofa, flipping through the newspaper. 

The rage from earlier had faded, leaving only cold indifference. 

I walked over and placed the agreement on the coffee table before him. 

In a hushed, barely–controlled hoarse voice, I said, “I’m leaving.” 

He remained silent. 

Seventeen years as siblings–I knew him inside out. 

He was in a fit of rage right now. 

If I said he’d beg me, that just guaranteed he never would. 

I dragged my suitcase to the front door and stepped outside. 

Behind, he finally snapped–the crash of crockery shattering on the floor. 

Then came his voice, trembling with fury. “Get out! And don’t you ever come back!” 

The china shattered with a jarring crash. 

My fingers trembled slightly where they gripped the suitcase handle. 

As I stepped outside, the night greeted me with a torrential downpour. 

No umbrella in hand. 

Going back for one now was out of the question. 

My ride was almost here, so I simply walked down the steps and stepped into the rain. 

Something came flying from behind, landing right in front of me. 

The pouring rain blurred my vision, making it impossible to focus. 

Straining my eyes for a long moment, I finally made out what was lying there in the rain. 

It was the slippers I’d left by the entrance. 

The pink fluffy bunny slippers were something Elbert brought back for me during a business trip late last year. 

After our parents passed away, his personality became quite twisted.

Those slippers sat in his suitcase for days before he finally had the housekeeper pass them to me. 

Right now, the slippers lay discarded on the rain–soaked ground, quickly getting caked with mud and becoming unrecognizable. 

Not a trace of what they once were remained. 

Just like me–cast aside by this world. 

I heard Elbert’s furious roar. “Clear out every last thing associated with her–down to the last tissue or 

cotton swab. Burn 

all to ashes!” 

Rain mixed with my tears, streaming down my face and dripping

“LOOKING FOR PARTICIPANTS: PAID SLEEP STUDY — $2,500 compensation. One overnight stay. No known sleep disorders. Call to apply.”

I was unemployed, behind on rent, living off microwave noodles and fear. Easy money just to sleep? Hell, I didn’t even read the fine print.

I showed up at the address, a medical-looking building off campus that smelled like disinfectant and quiet regret. A woman in scrubs greeted me. Too friendly. Too still. Her badge said “Dr. Ellery.”

She led me down long hallways lit with flickering fluorescents, into a small white room. One bed. One camera. Wires. Electrodes. Air so clean it felt dead.

“Lie down,” she said. “You’ll feel a little pinch. Then, sleep.”

That’s when everything started to go wrong.

I dreamed of a facility.

Not that facility. A different one. Bigger. Darker. Deeper. The walls weren’t white. They were a dull, fleshy pink. Something organic pulsed just beneath the surface, like muscle. Or membrane.

I walked barefoot down a hallway. The floor was warm. Other people were there too, some in hospital gowns, others in regular clothes. None of them spoke. They just stared straight ahead. Wide eyes. Open mouths.

A man in a lab coat walked up to me. His face moved too fast, flickering like an old film reel skipping frames. His voice sounded like static pushed through clenched teeth.

“Welcome to Level One.”

I woke up. Or at least, I thought I did.

The room looked the same. Same bed, same camera. But Dr. Ellery was different. Her smile was... wrong. Too wide. Like her skin had been stitched into place by someone who didn’t quite understand how faces were supposed to work.

“Did you sleep well?” she asked, tilting her head far too much. The angle was unnatural.

“I’m done. I want to leave.” I shot upright.

She blinked once. Then again. But this time, the eyelids moved sideways.

“You’re not finished yet,” she said.

\*\*\*

Every time I ""woke up"", I was in another layer. Each ""room"" felt a little less real than the last. The ceiling rippled like water. The walls breathed. In one version, the bed had veins. In another, the camera blinked at me, literally blinked, like an eye.

They told me I was making progress. That I was doing well.

“No subject has ever made it this far,” one of them said. His voice dripped like molasses slow, syrupy, wrong.

That’s when I realized: They weren’t studying how I slept. They were studying how I dreamed.

And I was sinking layer by layer, deeper into their world. That’s when I started seeing the others — the real ones.

People who’d also signed up for the sleep study. One girl, Sasha, told me she’d been there for weeks. Maybe months.

“They keep us dreaming,” she whispered. “They feed on the transitions. That flicker between sleep and waking. There’s energy in it.”

I asked how we could wake up. She laughed a horrible, empty sound, like something rattling in a dry throat.

“You can’t. Not unless you reach the bottom. But no one knows where that is.”

\*\*\*

One night, if you can even call it night here, I found a mirror. It was cracked. Blurry. But I saw my reflection. My skin was turning gray. My eyes sunken. Something was moving under the surface of my neck, twitching, like a worm squirming just beneath the flesh.

I screamed. The mirror rippled then showed me another version of myself. Smiling. Clean. Perfect. Behind her were the dream researchers. Their faces stretched like melting wax. Mouths open in silent howls.

I shattered the mirror. It bled. That’s when I started fighting back. Refusing to sleep inside the dream. Walking, endlessly, just to avoid the transitions.

They punished me. One level down, they took time away. No day. No night. Just a dull gray light pressing into my skull like a migraine that never ended. In another layer, I heard voices. My mother. My first girlfriend. My own voice. All whispering behind the walls.

They knew my memories. They knew my fears. And they used them. That level broke me.

I collapsed on the floor, sobbing. Whispered:

“Please... I just want to wake up.”

That’s when it happened. The Chief Investigator. He didn’t wear a lab coat. He wore my face. But not exactly,  just enough to feel wrong. The teeth were too long. The smile never moved. The eyes were glassy, blank, no pupils at all.

“You’re doing well,” he said, in my voice. “You’re getting close to Level Zero.”

“What’s Level Zero?” I croaked.

“Wake up,” he said. “If you survive.”

Then he touched my forehead. I screamed. I fell. Crashing through layers, like ice cracking beneath my feet. Flashes of rooms. Colors. Memories. My fifth birthday. My grandfather’s funeral. My first kiss. All of it peeling away, layer by layer, as if I was being stripped down to a raw, dreaming core.

And then—Silence.

Darkness. One word burned into my vision like static etched on a dead TV screen:

LEVEL ZERO

I opened my eyes. I was back. Back in the original unit. Bright lights. The real Dr. Ellery. My clothes neatly folded. A clipboard next to the bed.

“You’ve been under for seven hours,” she said, smiling gently. “How do you feel?”

I broke down in tears. Relief flooded through me like rain after a long, cracking drought. I grabbed her wrist.

“It was horrible,” I said. “I… I thought I was trapped.”

She handed me a cup of water. Said the brain can play strange tricks during sleep. Hypnagogia. Nested dreams. Lucid cycles.

“All perfectly normal.”

\*\*\*

I signed the forms. Took the check. Left that place as fast as I could. I ran all the way home.

That night, I tried not to sleep. Every time I shut my eyes I saw them. The researchers. My reflection. My own face, rotting.

I paced around my room. Drank coffee. Chewed my fingernails until they bled.

But eventually…I passed out.

And I woke up in a room I recognized.

A bed. A camera. A clipboard.

The door opened… and ""Dr. Ellery"" walked in. Only this time, she didn’t even bother wearing skin. Her face was a rotting mess of tentacles and teeth, eyes blinking like barnacles growing out of her skull. Her voice didn’t come from her mouth — it came from everywhere. From inside my ears. My teeth. My bones.

“You reached Level Zero,” she said. “But you never left.”

I screamed. Clawed at the walls. Tried to wake up. Tried to move. Tried to breathe.

Nothing changed. The room stayed still.

The clipboard now read:

Subject: Ethan Cross  
Sleep Study: Phase 3 – Simulated Awakening  
Response: Highly Compliant  
Status: Core Integrity Breached  
Extraction: Denied  
Retention: Indefinite

I wasn’t dreaming anymore. This was real. A reality they built. A prison made of belief. And the worst part?

Every time I think I’ve woken up… There’s another clipboard.

Just now, someone knocked at my apartment door. I answered. A man was standing there, breathless, holding a crumpled flyer.

“Hey,” he said. “Did you… do that sleep study thing?” His hands were shaking. “I can’t wake up.”

I smiled, my mouth opening wider than it should.

“Come in,” I said. “Let me tell you how it starts.”",2,1753199319.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

The rage from earlier had faded, leaving only cold indifference. 

I walked over and placed the agreement on the coffee table before him. 

In a hushed, barely–controlled hoarse voice, I said, “I’m leaving.” 

He remained silent. 

Seventeen years as siblings–I knew him inside out. 

He was in a fit of rage right now. 

If I said he’d beg me, that just guaranteed he never would. 

I dragged my suitcase to the front door and stepped outside. 

Behind, he finally snapped–the crash of crockery shattering on the floor. 

Then came his voice, trembling with fury. “Get out! And don’t you ever come back!” 

The china shattered with a jarring crash. 

My fingers trembled slightly where they gripped the suitcase handle. 

As I stepped outside, the night greeted me with a torrential downpour. 

No umbrella in hand. 

Going back for one now was out of the question. 

My ride was almost here, so I simply walked down the steps and stepped into the rain. 

Something came flying from behind, landing right in front of me. 

The pouring rain blurred my vision, making it impossible to focus. 

Straining my eyes for a long moment, I finally made out what was lying there in the rain. 

It was the slippers I’d left by the entrance. 

The pink fluffy bunny slippers were something Elbert brought back for me during a business trip late last year. 

After our parents passed away, his personality became quite twisted. 

! could tell–he’d bought me something cute, yet 

hand it to me directly. 

couldn’t bring himself toe 

Those slippers sat in his suitcase for days before he finally had the housekeeper pass them to me. 

Right now, the slippers lay discarded on the rain–soaked ground, quickly getting caked with mud and becoming unrecognizable. 

Not a trace of what they once were remained. 

Just like me–cast aside by this world. 

I heard Elbert’s furious roar. “Clear out every last thing associated with her–down to the last tissue or 

cotton swab. Burn 

all to ashes!” 

Rain mixed with my tears, streaming down my face and dripping

Its a bit of a wall of text so theres no surprises later (i.e. about my hearing) but I think that also shows I'm not afraid to write stuff.

Im looking to write to anyone, anywhere, 18+, ideally female as I have had quite the traumatic time with male figures from about 10 to 18 due to an awful childhood/mother (and her life choices), so has made relating to guys next to impossible. To talk about literally anything, exciting or ""boring"", I'm more than happy to hear about someone's daily life/struggles, and share mine, offering advice and help where possible, if needed. I know a little about a lot of things, and always wanting to improve on that. 

Have read a number of ""ads"" on here and not sure how much to write, what not to write, and what to ask for so I might ramble a bit. But I hope is relevant.

I spent almost my entire life with Social Anxiety, which made making friends impossible, and made holding a job difficult too. I sought help for this about 8 years ago and due to this life has improved. I go to the gym and look after myself, and don't think I'm bad looking, no model for sure but not bad, I think I should be approachable. People don't see why I'm lonely or understand the struggles I seem to have forming connections but still I'm very lonely finding it hard to connect with people. I've been single 4 years now after 15-year relationship (parted as friends, just went on different paths). I do a job I enjoy (IT support), and I speak to loads of people at work (Im 1 of 2 IT people supporting 360 users) and get on well with everyone, investing far too much into the help I provide. However, this hasn't ever really led to friendships outside work. I seem to get 1-2 very close friends, and before I can make a 3rd, one of those two will leave for whatever reason, then another will come along. Due to this I'm really quite lonely, especially since being single (I strive to look after my partner, so without that life is empty) its really hard work as you get older to make friends, as everyone my age has a family/partner/good friend circle so no time for others.

Aside from the social anxiety (mostly fixed) I'm hard of hearing and while I have also got help for that, its still impossible to understand speech in groups, as such pubs/clubs/loud places are no good for me (unless its with someone I know well) so any places where you might meet people is very difficult and I end up frustrated feeling more alone in a group of people than if I was actually alone. 1-2-1 people don't realise I have hearing issues. I just suck badly groups of more than that. Even in a 3 I find myself sitting silent trying to follow the other 2.

I enjoy talking to people, when I can. I especially like writing to people about any/everything. So maybe penpals will help fill a void in my life while also allowing me to learn about others as I do like to learn about people and what makes them tick (non-judgmental).

So thats how I came to be here.

Aside from the details above...

\- I do IT for a job but feel a bit of a fraud to be honest, I much prefer to be doing physical work. Really enjoy DIY/renovations, had hoped to do this for a living but didnt work out with my ex.  
\- I can/will talk about any/everything  
\- I'm the kind of person that if you ask me my day, you better really be interested because I will tell you, in detail  
\- I live in a small house in Oxfordshire, England, with my dog. Currently sorting out my tiny garden and finishing off DIY projects  
\- Due to the mentioned issues, I haven't travelled much but would like to get out into the world and see more  
\- I'm a sharer of experiences. I would rather do nothing than do something on my own as I really LOVE sharing the experience and talking about it with someone while also seeing it through their eyes as I do struggle to stop and smell the roses when on my own as I tend to see the experience as a task to complete instead of something to actually experience (so traveling alone isnt an option  
\- I like hiking, cinema/film, a good TV series (just finished Last of Us 2, and about to start both Star Trek Strange new worlds s3, and Dexter Resurrection), getting into the Theatre (not easy with bad hearing) and my fav so far is Moulin Rouge  
\- Love inappropriate jokes and innuendos, and think the world is far too PC these days.  
\- Im the kind of person that if I don't know something, I'll happy spend an hour or 5 on google finding out about it rather than leave it not-known, I'll also do this on someone else's half too (unasked) as they raised my curiosity  
\- Tend to feel I'm younger than my age, I think because I missed out on a LOT of life/growing up due to the anxiety, not wanting to conform to whats expected of my age range.

So thats probably more than enough about me.

Not sure what to expect from this but if any of these is interesting to you, do let me know via DM :) Please include more than 1 sentence if you choose to contact me, I've taken the time to let you know about me, please respond in the same way.

I have plenty of time for writing and ideally would like to make friends I could chat to, meet up with and do stuff/travel with.

I made a very good contact via the penpals post I made so hoping for the same thing here but closer to home as popping out for coffee with someone in another time zone is tricky.",1,1753199225.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

I am single and I crave for a genuine romantic partner.
I have never been into proper relationship.

My first relationship was always a long distance ( I come from strict family and was living with my parents that time), I just had kissed him once properly. We parted away as we grew apart. He is with someone and I have zero feelings for him now.

Second relationship was not even relationship, we met few times and I had to leave city as I was changing job. We used to chat (mostly cheesy) but he was not interested in any kind of serious commitment (I get to know after 2yrs that he is still figuring out what he wants to do with his life).

So since 2023, I am single no chatting, dating ,  meeting, .... nothing at all.

Now I cry in the night just to be hold. I don't have friends as I'm introvert. This is whole new country, new culture.

I tried dating app but people are more interested into sleeping with rather than knowing eachother and starting something genuine.

I'm trying to find solidarity into my loneliness and not let eat me.
But whenever I see a couple being cozy, I get tears. I see sad songs/ quotes, my heart sinks.

Sometimes I see porn and the passionate foreplay will make me cry.
I cry after mastrabutating myself every time.

The faces of every single man I have liked by my heart and desired to be with flashes just at the moment when I'm finishing and it breaks me down.

It is so depressing to go through it.

In day I feel sad of not having friends to grab coffee or lunch. So I stay in my Lab protecting myself from being by encountering the happy group ( none of my colleagues are experimental so I have to work alone in the lab).

My supervisor is friendly but you know he can't be friend.

I know I need therapy which I would go for probably next month when I have enough money (it is minimum 200 dollars fees here).

I slept without dreams, and woke up earlier than I wanted to, but later than I was used to, probably around 10:30. I stumbled out of my tent to see Lana on a SAT-phone (satellite phone, if you like hiking or camping in remote areas you need one), and the rest of the group looking disturbed.



I joined the group and Marybell passed me a cup of coffee (I’m starting to like her more) while I leaned against a tree as I listened to Lana wrap up the phone call.



“That’s right officer, his pack was still in his tent.” She paused, listening, then said: “I don’t know, hold on,” she covered the receiver and asked us, “Does anyone know what kind of car he drives?”



Gabriel nodded, “We carpooled, we both live in the same area. He drives a fairly new Toyota Tacoma.”



Lana relayed that back to the officer and waited, “Right. No we haven’t had a chance to check the parking lot where we were… Because it’s an eight mile hike!”



She gave us a look that clearly said “get a load of this guy” and I had to hold in a chuckle. Finally she said, “Okay thank you, please let us know if you find him. Yes, we’ll call you if he shows back up. Okay thank you.”



She hung up and passed the SAT-phone back to Gabriel who slipped it into his pack and rejoined the group. 



I said, “So, still no Scott?”



Lana looked disturbed as she said, “I could have sworn I heard him last night as I was falling asleep. Like I just could have sworn I heard him saying my name, I thought he would be back today, but he isn’t.”



My brow furrowed, “Did you hear someone whistling too?”



Lana nodded, “Yeah! It sounded like someone was walking back towards camp and whistling the tune we’ve been studying. I figured Scott must have worked off whatever he ran off about and come back. I was going to go out and talk to him, but then it sounded like he was whispering my name and…”



She trailed off, her face going bright red, and Marybell put a protective arm around her and glared at the rest of the group with the same expression she used when one of us messed up and called her by her full name. It was clear Lana would not be questioned for her reasoning.



Marybell said, “Lana had her reasons not to go outside in the middle of the night and I don’t think anyone should challenge her on that. Besides it’s clear that whoever she heard, that wasn’t Scott.”



I felt goosebumps rise on my arm and stepped into the sunlight, hoping it would warm the chill that seemed to have seeped into my blood. “No, Lana, you clearly made the right choice. You don’t need to feel bad about that. If it had been Scott he would have returned to his tent. Or at least grabbed his stuff and went back to his car.” An idea occurred to me and I turned to Gabriel. “Hey, are his car keys in his pack?”



Gabriel nodded solemnly, “I checked as soon as I woke up. And I didn’t hear anyone come into my tent last night, and I’m a light sleeper. Whatever Lana heard, that wasn’t Scott.”



I rubbed my arms, the cold fearful chill wouldn’t go away, and I was wishing I could just go back home, but as we’d already told the ranger: it was an eight mile hike back to the cars and we were all still tired from the day before.



I said, “So… are we staying for the whole weekend like we planned, or are we heading back now?”



Everyone looked around uncomfortably until Leano said, “I do not see a reason to leave. We can all continue searching for Scott, then leave as we originally planned.”



I looked around the rest of the group, “Is everyone in agreement?”



Everyone gave their assent and we settled down into a tense silence to drink our coffee. To be honest, at the time I didn’t think anything had happened to Scott, and I was mostly just mad at him for wrecking the first vacation I’d taken in months. The rest of the group looked similarly irritated, which I think is why we didn’t split off to look for him until mid-afternoon.



We did our best to enjoy the morning, even though Scott’s disappearance sat between us all like an elephant, and had a pleasant lunch before we split off into groups to search for him. We decided to have Gabriel and Leano pair off, then me, Lana, and Marybell went in the opposite direction.



We combed through the woods screaming ourselves hoarse intermittently until the sun was starting to dip in the sky. We got back to camp when the sky was just starting to turn pink, Gabriel and Leano appeared not long after we started making dinner looking just as disappointed and annoyed as we felt.



By the time we had finished dinner it was dusk, and dark greys and blues had replaced the soft pink on the horizon. It was clear none of us wanted to go back to looking for Scott, and I think we had all decided he was fine and just messing with us, but we sat in a tense silence, no one wanting to suggest we give up or get back to it.



Finally Marybell sighed loudly and said, “Okay, I’m not going back out in the dark. Let’s make some smores and tell stories or something.”



Everyone let out a relieved sigh as Gabriel lumbered off into the near darkness to retrieve more fuel for the fire, and Leano went to the food packs and found the stuff we had for s'mores. By the time the stars had come out overhead the general atmosphere was once again fun and celebratory, and it seemed like the majority of us were a lot less frustrated. 



Which I think is why, when we heard whistling off in the woods, we met it with excitement instead of concern.



As we sat around the fire a familiar tune wafted up to our camp and we all jumped up in excitement. The problem was, we all ran in different directions. I was absolutely certain I heard the whistling coming from directly behind me, but Marybell sprinted off to the left, Lana turned and went up the path we had taken to get here, and Leano and Gabriel went in their own directions.



I stopped at the edge of the woods, feeling a sense of heavy trepidation weigh down my body, keeping my feet from moving. I looked back at the rest of the group disappearing into the trees and made a snap decision, taking off after Marybell who was closest to me.



I followed after her, using the sound of her crashing through the woods to ignore the whistling that seemed to want to pull me in the opposite direction. When Marybell finally stopped running we were deep in the woods and very nearly lost. She stopped and looked back at me as though she were coming out of a trance.



In a whisper she asked, “Sammy? Where did Scott go?”



I shook my head and walked towards her like I was trying not to spook a horse. I didn’t speak until I could put my hand on her shoulder, feeling the warm skin beneath my hand, “Mary I… I don’t think that was Scott. I- did you see that everyone went in a different direction?”



She shook her head, looking sick, “What was I following? Sammy, I could have sworn that was Scott but when you stopped me-”



I had nothing to say, I felt helpless. I grabbed her hand and said, “We need to go back to camp and see if we can find the others. No more taking off into the woods at night.”



She nodded numbly and followed me as I traced our path back. It felt like it took a lot longer to get back than it did when we were following the whistling. When we made it back I was relieved to see Leano and Gabriel standing by the fire looking scared.



When we stumbled into the firelight both men rushed toward us, Leano grabbed me and Gabriel grabbed Marybell and we both got swooped up into warm hugs. When Leano finally let go we took a moment to catch our breath.



Finally I said, “What was that? Does anyone know where Lana went?“



Gabriel shook his head grimly, “When I realized we all went in different directions following the same sound I went after Leano.”



He gave a meaningful look to Leano who picked up the story in a soft, seemingly terrified voice, “I was running after the song, I thought I could see Scott but I realized after Gabriel grabbed me that I had been following something that… didn’t look human. I only thought it was Scott because- I think I wanted to believe it was him? Or perhaps it was like an illusion. It was Scott, I was sure it was him, right until Gabriel stopped me and then I saw this *thing.* It appeared to wear a mask made out of bone.”



Marybell made a choking sound and whispered, “I saw the same thing.”



Gabriel patted him on the back gently, “When I saw him he was about to step into a pond. I mean honestly it looked more like a bog than anything else… Maybe he would have been fine, but I don’t know.”



Marybell looked at me in horror, “It was the same thing for me. It was only after you stopped me that I realized I wasn’t seeing Scott.”



I shuddered, “We need to find Lana. I have no idea what’s out there, but I don’t think we’re safe.”



Marybell and Leano nodded, but Gabriel literally put his foot down, “Absolutely not, my abuela would beat me with her chancla if we did that… if I even survive anyway.” He shook his head like he was clearing it. “No, nobody else goes out in the woods until morning.”



I started to object but Gabriel stood in front of me, his tall form sending a clear message that he wasn’t letting anyone go back into the woods as he rumbled, “Sammy, I’m serious. Two members of our group are missing, I don’t want that number going up. Weren’t you the one saying Nora would freak out if you lost anyone? Well let's try to keep that number from climbing.”



My shoulders fell as I looked around the group to see if anyone else was on my side, but nobody would make eye contact with me. Finally in a small voice I said, “Can we look for her in the morning?”



Gabriel nodded, relief visibly flooding through him. “Yes, of course. But for tonight I don’t think anyone should be alone. Leano, you should stay in my tent. Bella and Sam, you two can share. But we need to honor the buddy system from now on. No one so much as sneezes without their buddy knowing about it.”



I glanced over my shoulder into the woods and I could have sworn I saw movement. I was still hopeful that Lana was okay, maybe even nearby. I stepped towards the trees, but Gabriel grabbed my arm. I glared up at him, but stayed where I was and called out, “Hello? Is someone out there?”



A voice responded from the darkness, sounding a little too far away, considering where the shadow seemed to be speaking from, “Sammy?”



I shuddered, the voice didn’t sound like anything. It’s not just that it didn’t sound like Lana, it didn’t sound like a living being at all. I stepped backwards at the same time that Gabriel started dragging me to the fire, muttering, “Nuh uh, no way, dios mio, abuela will kill me if I get killed out here.”



I couldn’t stop staring into the darkness, trying to catch a glimpse of the speaker.



I called out, “Nora, is that you?”



Gabriel lifted his eyebrows at me, but Marybell and Leano both offered approving looks.



The voice called back, in a tone that was almost sing-songy despite still sounding a little too far away, “Yeeeees, me, Nora. Come here, I found the other one.”



Gorge rose in my throat and I collapsed to my knees as I did my best to hold it in. Marybell whimpered and Gabriel stumbled backwards, nearly stepping into the fire as he did. 



Leano looked at us helplessly and whispered, ""What is that?”



I shook my head as we all stayed silent, waiting.



I’ll do my best to describe what the voice sounded like, but it’s hard. If you’ve ever heard one of those AI voices that’s fully generated, no human voice was involved in recording or anything, it had that kind of quality. Clearly not human, clearly pretending to be. It was hollow, but not in the way that AI voices are hollow, it was hollow like the inside of a mountain, or the very deepest, farthest corner of a dark cave. My point is it sounded natural, earthen, as if the voice was as much a part of nature as a wolf’s howl, or a bird's screech. If you’ve ever heard the warning song a bird gives before a really bad storm, it felt exactly like that. A hollow earthen warning that I was too late to heed.



The next time the voice spoke it had clearly moved coming from the other side of the woods, it had changed from the poor imitation of a woman’s voice to a slightly better imitation of Scott’s voice, “Sammy, I’m right out here, Sammy. Can you come help me, I’m stuck?”



I wanted to scream every time it said my name, but I forced myself to hold my ground. I took in deep, long breaths as I tried to calm my nerves. Gabriel grabbed both my shoulders to keep me from moving, which I found mostly insulting because I’m nowhere near that stupid.



The four of us huddled by the fire, adding what was left of our fuel to it at occasional intervals, and doing our best not to make a sound. Every time one of us spoke, even in a whisper, the voice would reply, calling out from a new position every time. Sometimes it sounded like it was just at the edge of the darkness, other times it sounded further away, twice it even sounded like it was coming from above us, which made Marybell sob uncontrollably until Gabriel could calm her down.



After we ran out of fuel I looked to Gabriel, wondering if he would be brave enough to run to the edge of the woods for more fuel. None of us wanted to leave the ring of fire light, none of us wanted to go back to our tents where it would eventually become completely dark. But if we stayed by the fire without finding more fuel, we would still eventually find ourselves plunged into darkness anyway.



Gabriel looked exhausted, his brown skin was so pale it looked ashen, and the bags under his eyes were heavy and dark. I leaned towards him and whispered, “What do we do now?”



He gave me a look that I can only describe as begrudging terror, cleared his throat, and said, “Okay everyone, we need to-” he looked up at the crown of trees above our heads and gulped painfully, then gestured for us all to come closer and began whispering, “We need to get to the tents. Keep a flashlight nearby, don’t leave your tent and don’t let anyone convince you to leave your tent or open it for any reason.”



From up in the trees, about ten, maybe twenty feet away, we heard laughter.



Everyone winced as though we’d been slapped, all at the same time, then we began slowly moving away from the fire. Marybell and I intertwined hands and I pointed to my tent. Marybell mouthed *I want to grab my sleeping bag,* and then pointed at her own tent.*.* Well it was either that or *I want to park my jeep in there.*



We walked slowly to Marybell’s tent, eyes scanning the woods the whole time. There was the occasional bird cry or rustle of leaves, and a few times there was a terrifying twig snap, but the voice remained quiet. She ducked into her tent to grab her sleeping bag, and a few other items, as I stood right next to her tent, scanning the darkness and trying not to cry.



I felt like the biggest fool in the world. My mom had warned me against going out into the wilderness and I had ignored her most important piece of advice. I was probably the only person in the group who had a former Appalachian resident giving me advice. And I ignored it. I thought about the list of rules she had made me write down, and felt a wave of shame course over me. I should never have gone on this trip.



Marybell collected her things and stepped back out into the halflight of the dying fire. With a tense nod we began making our way towards my tent. I could still hear the occasional whistle from the forest, always coming from a different location, always sounding like it was coming from a different distance.



I felt relief rush into me when we reached my tent, quickly replaced by a new wave of fear when I heard the song being hummed. Do you know how close someone has to be for you to feel them humming? Not hear, but feel the vibrations of their hum. I grabbed Marybell and pushed both of us into the tent, zipped it up, and laid down back to back, breathing heavily. I found myself focusing on Marybell’s breathing to drown out the sounds coming from outside.



For the first few minutes we were in the tent, we watched a shadow pace outside, alternating humming and laughing. After a few minutes the shadow outside our tent skipped away and the humming changed to singing. I managed to catch a few words, to the same tune as our song, “Old as mountain roots, like blood beneath a miners boots.”



I turned to look at Marybell, but she had her eyes pressed tightly closed, in the light of my flashlight she looked as pale as bone.



I couldn’t close my own eyes, I had to keep them wide open and on the zipper. I was utterly terrified that the figure from the woods would reach out, unzip the tent, and step inside. Instead, the night stretched on with more of the same. Whistling, footsteps, rustling, and the occasional sound of laughter. It made my blood run cold.



I’m not sure when I fell asleep, but at some point I did, because I woke up to weak sunlight poking its way through my tent. Marybell was awake and rubbing her eyes when I sat up.



I said, “Good morning. Have you heard from Gabriel and Leano yet?”



Marybell shook her head, and I went to pull down the zipper but she put her hand on mine to stop me. “What if… what if it’s some kind of trick?”



I looked up and saw the shadow of tree branches against the plastic of the tent, I could tell sunlight was filtering through, and I thought I heard bird song outside too. But Marybell had put the idea in my head and I was terrified that somehow I was wrong. I didn’t know if the thing in the woods could create an illusion like that, but it had made all of us think we were chasing after Scott when we weren’t. I pulled my hand away, took a deep breath, and then remembered there was a ‘window’ in my tent that I could unzip. I leaned over, unzipped the window, and sighed in relief. Sweet, beautiful sunlight.



Marybell and I stepped outside, stretched, and went to Gabriel and Leano’s tent to check on them. It took nearly half an hour to convince them to exit their tent, apparently they’d had the same thought as Marybell, but after answering a million questions to prove who we were, we managed to get them both outside. 



Gabriel gave us both warm hugs when we opened the tent, Leano merely squeezed our shoulders gently. 



We packed our things quickly, including splitting up Lana and Scott’s things so we could take them back with us. Just in case.



I did stop and pull out Lana’s sun hat, setting it down gently where she could find it. Just in case.



As we started the long hike back, Gabriel pulled out the SAT-phone and called the police to explain what happened the night before, and let them know another member of our group was missing. After he hung up, no one spoke for a long time, aside from the occasional call for Lana or Scott.



Part of me wishes I could tell you that the hike back was fraught with terror, that we were chased by whatever horrible creature took Lana and Scott, but it wasn’t. Overall it was a lovely hike, that probably would have been very relaxing if not for the two missing people. It honestly made me kind of angry, knowing that whatever was stalking us the night before was too cowardly to come out in the daylight. When we got back to our vehicles there was a police cruiser waiting for us. 



We gave our statements, telling the full truth despite the way the officer interviewing us rolled his eyes when we started talking about the whistling and voices in the woods. I didn’t care at that point, I just wanted to go home. We answered his questions, supplied any details we thought he needed but missed during his questions, and then said goodbye to each other and got in our cars.



It was Sunday, and I knew I would have to explain things to Nora the next day, but right at that moment all I wanted to do was sleep. I made the long drive back to my house, parked, and shuffled inside, refusing to look at the trees around my house as I did. Just in case.



Despite my exhaustion, I couldn’t sleep. I wound up shuffling around my house guiltily, not wanting to open any of my blinds or risk going outside. It was still daylight, but nothing felt safe anymore. I had this image in the back of my head, Lana and Scott standing dead eyed next to the deer I’d seen the morning before we left. I wasn’t sure if I would ever feel ready to leave my house again.



Finally, when the sun started going down I couldn’t handle the fear anymore and I called my mom. I explained everything, admittedly through tears, and she listened gently until I was done.



Finally she said, “Okay first things first, the two missing people. They weren’t found?”



I shook my head, remembered she couldn’t see me, and choked out, “No, but to be fair I got home like two hours ago.”



She sighed, “Sammy, they’re both dead. Process that however you need to, but *process it.* Accept it, take it as truth because when you hear them calling for you tonight you absolutely have to stay inside.”



All the air rushed out of me as if she had broken one of my ribs. The panic I’d been managing to hold at bay had just rushed through my body so quickly I was surprised I wasn’t having a heart attack. I managed to say, “Mom they’ve only been missing for less than two days. They might-”



She cut me off with a more stern voice than I had ever heard her use in my adult life, “Samira stop it, listen to me. I’m so sorry this happened to you. I’m not going to say any “I told you so’s”, so in return I need you to listen, and I mean really listen.” She stopped and when she came back her tone was a lot softer, albeit still pretty stern. “Your friends are already dead, and I’m so sorry. But letting yourself believe they may be alive isn’t going to keep you safe. But knowing what you’re up against will.”



And that’s when she finally told me her story.

I do daily drop-offs and pick-ups. BiL also does drop-offs and pick-ups. 


I have to leave an hour before school starts in order to drop everyone off in time before getting to work. BiL takes maybe 10-15 mins to drop kids off, quick run to get coffee and get to work.

... my BiL's ""city"" has one main road, everything is on the way for him. Not to mention his kids' school is literally K-12. One drop off and done. 


... I live in a bigger city that separates preK, K-5, MS, and HS. oh and they aren't all on the same road. There are parents lined up at each school and yes I drop off one kid at each. Not to mention, each school starts at a different time which means gates don't open until 30 mins before school starts. So I'm having to drop the older kids off to walk there because of all the ""don't drop kids off early, there's no adult supervision"" notices we keep getting from their school. Walking will kill time until gates open. I have to physically walk in and sign a book to check in my prek kid so I can't drop him off early.

They were by our side for every appointment, at the hospital, and for all the little daily details that suddenly become huge when you’re new parents in a new country. I honestly can’t imagine trying to do this without them—it would have been like assembling new furniture without the instructions.

1m6hj57,https://i.redd.it/vshz9knp4gef1.jpeg,One year ownership impressions,"**The summary:**

1 year of ownership
2024 hybrid AWD
22,000km (13,700 miles)
Lifetime fuel economy 6.35L/100km* (37mpg)

**The good:**

Fuel economy. It is rated for 6.9l/100km in Canada, I am beating that by 10%. This includes cold ass winters with remote starts every morning and also some 40C+ (100-110F) summer days. One thing I want to note is that 4,500km was towing which I generally averaged 10L/100km. So my true lifetime is 7.1L/100km (33mpg), but since most people don't tow and also isn't representative of the vehicle I have omitted those 4,500km. 

Super quiet ride. The cabin and the hybrid system is very quiet. Much more refined than the multiple 2.5T I have driven.

H Tex seats. They look brand new. Nice and plush. Zero wrinkles or wear like some of the leather folks are reporting. Hey Hyundai, offer more H Tex colours!

Towing has been great. I tow a 4 person seadoo which weighs 950lbs on trailer. A 16ft boat. A 5x8 utility trailer that sees anything from my ATV to bags of concrete or lumber. I've had it loaded up 1,500lbs and the car pulls it very well, the toruq from the hybrid system is very nice when pulling a boat out of the water on a ramp or even just starting out from a stop. And 10L/100km (23.5mp) when towing is pretty great. My old V8 truck towing my boat would get 13L/100km (18mpg) on the highway. 

I find the seats very comfy on long drives. And I love the slide and recline of the second row. 

**The bad:**

It's been to the dealer more than I would like. Bluelink has been incompetent liars. Hyundai Canada has been standoffish and somewhat useless unless pushed. 

Recalls aside. It's been to the dealer to have the horn replaced, entire passenger headlight housing replaced, rust on the top of a door taken care of, multiple systems diagnosed and some still on going. Phantom fault codes. The OBD port recall had to go back because they damaged a clip and the dash was falling down. All told I have been to the dealer 8 times for issues outside of recalls, 10 including recalls. 

The interior hard plastic surfaces is the worst I've ever seen. They scuff SUPER easy. Even a 1998 Cavalier had better plastic. 

The wireless phone charge is shit. It's a phone oven. 

No second row HVAC controls was a blunder. I wonder if the 2027 refresh will add them. 

The exterior haptic door lock on the drivers door sometime goes completely dead. I can walk around to the passenger side and it works fine. Dealer asked for videos when it happens, sent 2, hyundai denied warranty saying the dealer needs to replicate it. Hyundai told me this is a lockout function if you press it too many times - lol utter BS. 

When towing, the coffee break warning is too sensitive. My seadoo is light and on a short wheelbase trailer, it can be twitchy which seems to set the warning off. Other Hyundai models lets you turn the coffee break warning off, but not Santa Fe. Let's get this option. 

**The ugly:**

Windshield washer nozzle are aimed way too low. They don't effectively clean the windshield, especially in the winter when it is really needed. Hyundai Canada says ""this is how the engineers designed it so this is how it's supposed to be"" lol i don't think they know how moronic that is. I've seen a half dozen other people complain about this. How this got through development testing is inexcusable - unless maybe they have different suppliers (mine was assembled in Korea). 

HVAC doesnt turn off. Someone pointed out that if you select cabin recirculate after selecting OFF, it will turn the fan off but only if you don't open the sunroof. If you open or pop the sunroof it immediately turns cabin recirc off... I know this may sound silly as an ""ugly"" but it is ridiculous that you can't simply turn the system off when you push OFF.

There are no updates in Canada, OTA or USB. Hyundai Canada says updates (globally) are only for ECU updates. I've shown them the proof that the USA and other countries have gotten multiple OTA updates which added features - Green mode for hybrids, sports on the infotainment, modified radio info layout, etc. The Hyundai Canada website and product guides both say OTA infotainment updates are standard. So after 6 months they have now agreed they are reviewing everything internally and with US counterparts. 

Bluelink. I picked up the car on July 21 2024. On July 24 2024 the Bluelink app was telling me I had 2 DTC engine fault codes. I took in to the dealer who said the car wasn't showing any codes. I discussed with bluelink for the next 12 months until FINALLY last week they issued an app update that cleared the codes. During the 12 months, Bluelink lied, deflected, ignored, condescended and generally was terrible to deal with. Other than the app always showing the vehicle had a health issue, the main thing is how truly terrible Bluelink customer support was. 

Right from the start, the vehicle had a light pulsing when running in hybrid mode at lower speed. I took it into the delaer last August for it and they couldn't replicate it. Back then I hadn't pinpointed when it was doing it. The pulse has now turned into a light jerking. And I am getting a shift shock from 2nd to 3rd right when the car is first turned on and it seems to be fine after that - I read someone else had the same shift shock. It's going back into the dealership next week to show them. 

**Closing:**

Overall it has been an ok vehicle. I'm really happy with the fuel economy. I really like the interior and exterior styling. If someone asked me if I would buy it again knowing I would go through everything I did all over again, no I wouldn't. But I also don't readily know what I else I would buy lol. I also recognize it's a modern vehicle, and very few are without issues nowadays. It was also the first year of a new generation and also early on in production. With that said, the 2026 Palisade hybrid has caught our eye, but I definitely would not be getting a first year model again lol, maybe in 2028. 

There is no easy lemon law or buy back in Canada. Standard warranty is 5 years 100,000km, and extended warranties are way more expensive than in the US. I am pushing for a discounted 10yr 160,000km warranty as I don't have a ton of longterm confidence in this specific car. This is my experience. I know a lot of you adore the car. With the issues I've had and the trouble working with Bluelink and Hyundai, the shine has worn off, unfortunately. ",2,1753198989.0,HyundaiSantaFe,0,1.0,False

1m6hhkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m6hhkz/does_the_hamilton_beach_flexbrew_singleserve/,Does the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffee Maker Review Exceed Expectations?,"The Hamilton Beach 49900 FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffee Maker has been my caffeine companion for the past few weeks, and it has genuinely transformed my mornings. As someone who tends to bounce between pods and ground coffee, I couldn't resist the versatility this device promised. It feels like a small, efficient café right on my countertop. With its sleek black finish and compact design, this coffee maker doesn't hog kitchen space, which is an absolute blessing when you're working with limited room. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things that caught my attention was the FlexBrew’s slim build. Measuring less than 5 inches wide, you can easily fit it into tight spaces. If your kitchen is anything like mine—filled with an assortment of gadgets fighting for counter real estate—this single-serve coffee maker will slide in without causing a territorial dispute with your toaster. The capacitive-touch controls feel intuitive and add a modern touch. I’ll admit, it’s satisfying to tap a button lightly and see it do its job, especially when I'm still half-asleep.

**Ease of Use in Daily Routines**  
The setup is extremely user-friendly. I’ve used both the K-Cup® pod holder and the single-serve brew basket, each of which snaps in without any fuss. The water reservoir has a 14 oz. capacity, so there’s no need to constantly refill unless you’re trying to fuel an espresso marathon. The water view window is incredibly handy, keeping you from overflowing your cup. Brewing time is commendably fast—about two minutes for an 8-ounce cup—which is perfect on a rushed morning. Trust me, the last thing you want on a busy day is a sluggish coffee maker.

[Time to see Hamilton Beach 49900 FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffee Maker cost on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b095hy42vf/)

**Merits**  
- Compact design saves space.  
- Quick brewing speeds, delivering an 8 oz. cup in around 2 minutes.  
- Operates with both coffee pods and grounds, offering great versatility.  
- Touch-sensitive controls with options for regular or bold brew strength.  

**Insufficient Aspects**  
- Cleaning the reusable filter can be slightly tedious, especially when using coffee grounds.  
- The plastic build, though lightweight, might feel less durable over time.  

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
The performance of this unit aligns perfectly with my expectations. I’ve brewed both bold and regular strength coffee, and the flavor depth is surprisingly good for a single-serve machine. While pods offer convenience, I found the grounds option brewed a better-tasting cup—it’s a game-changer if you have a favorite grind you like to use. The adjustable brewing strength setting deserves mention; having the ability to control how robust your coffee will be provides that extra customization I didn’t know I needed. 

**Fit for Compact and Multifunctional Kitchens**  
This coffee maker is ideal for individuals living in dorms, studios, or small apartments. My brother tested it in his college dorm, and he raved about how it fit perfectly on his cramped desk without dominating his space. Likewise, if you’re someone juggling kitchen real estate, the slim profile will take away that stress. For road trips or setting up for work events, its lightweight design makes it portable as well.

**Competing Products**  
I’ve tested a few other single-serve machines, including the Keurig K-Mini and the Nespresso Essenza Mini. Compared to the Keurig K-Mini, the FlexBrew offers the advantage of brewing larger cups up to 14 oz., which is fantastic for people who like a slightly bigger coffee. In contrast, the Nespresso Essenza Mini delivers more specialized espresso shots, but it tends to cater to a different class of coffee drinkers. For someone like me who enjoys bouncing between pods and ground coffee, the FlexBrew emerges as the more versatile option of the three, especially since the price range for all these devices overlaps quite a bit.

**True Value**  
Let’s talk about whether the FlexBrew justifies its cost. While it doesn't come with premium materials, its space-efficient design, dual-use coffee capabilities, and capacitive-touch controls make it a great device for its price point. Imagine the cost of buying a separate pod machine and a coffee grounds brewer—you’d likely spend more. This single device handles both, so you’re saving money while enjoying excellent features.

Finding Grace’ 

Not really remembering anything from before, Before, a dark raven haired Latina, brown eyed girl named Jenna Ortega’ had awakened into a world in which she would now find herself. Living in a world now where she see meets people that have since passed. But from within her new world that she now lives in, along with the people that she meets along the way. While riding her bike discovering new trails that would show her a life that was once hers. 

From waking up to looking out her window into a world that was still very new to her,  while still giving her the feeling of that she has always been here. With anticipation of what was about to be, Jenna’ a very outgoing dark haired girl! That very much knew how to handle things that would come her way. 

While at the same time meeting new people along the way while finding herself coming closer to some in her life. But as Jenna’ would quickly get dressed, anticipating what the day may bring her. Wearing a black tee and a pair of cut at the knees jeans! Not forgetting about her shoes that just fit her personality that she was to everyone around her. 

A girl that wasn’t afraid to express herself! While at the same time excepting a challenge! From anyone that wanted to race her! With her showing them what was! While at the same time! Finding herself coming closer to others! Knowing that the world around her was changing every day seeing and meeting new people along the way. While at the same time! Finding out that some people around her had many stories of their own to share. Finding herself coming close to some! Whether it was as a friend! or like family to her! 

But as Jenna’ quickly got dressed! Grabbing her bike and on her way she went! Not looking back! But only ahead! Ahead to what was to be! As she was now finding herself. Looking out onto a bustling street in front of her, Jenna’ was going to let nothing stand in her way! From doing this run! A run that she had a done dozens of times before. For just as the morning’s sun was making its way into a new day. A new day for her! For everything seemed new to Jenna’

In a way that was just unexplainable to her! For it felt like she had always been here, lived here! And was born here. But unknowingly to her at the moment, the days ahead would show her different paths. Paths that would take her to slowly finding out who she was. For as sat there on her bike, looking down a street just in front of her was that long all downhill from there. But the need to race! The need for speed was there! And she here now and ready for her run.

With her not always having the feeling of really not knowing on how or why she was here. But in a way she felt that she had always been here, but with her having that feeling in her that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, but she only knew where she was at the moment! only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! Feeling the wind push up against her! Speeding in and around cars along the way!

With the feeling of something just being different about still residing within her, more so than usually toady. With the feeling that all of this still felt very new to her! The surroundings! The people! Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here! That she had always been here.

Jenna’ was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 23rd birthday. Growing up in a small town that had a big city feel to it to her. But to Jenna’ it was her home, but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that one day she would riding her bike through the downtown streets. 

Weaving in and around cars passing by them as the wind blew through her long Raven hair! feeling free from the world around her! Racing was her excitement! And it showed! With her smile saying it all. Making her way through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed them by.

With Jenna’ having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Jenna’! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just him watching out for her! For her own safety.  But Jenna’ also had someone else watching out for her! A young latino! Named Hector’! With his dark hair brown eyes, And a smile For Jenna’! But Jenna’ was just your typical young brown eyed girl! Who liked her shredded jeans and tee shirt and hoodie living her life! Her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Jenna’ being the girl that she was! Never backing down from a challenge, finding herself racing through the towns streets, finding herself racing along with one or two others.

Not to say that one of them didn’t catch her eye, But! From time to time, Hector’ very much would catch her eye, for he was the kinda guy that could charm on a dime. A Latino, Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match! Especially on a bike. Often calling out to Jenna’ saying to her.

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Jenna’ Whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them. Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it. Knowing that Jenna’ was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Jenna’ leaving him with a glance and a smile! as Jenna’ left him looking. And saying to himself “Dam! That’s my girl!”

Just way the way he liked it! Always watching out for her. While Jenna’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different! 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. Finding new trails along the way but with each new trail she would ride. It was like it was showing something to her! As if it was trying to tell her something! 

But with each new day bringing something new to her! A new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself very well on a bike, Jenna’ would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city. Telling Jrnna’ about his own street races, with Jenna’ always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Jenna’ needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go on forever! Dodging in and out of traffic! But always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Jenna’ was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life for her. More than often finding herself thinking about her life! For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life! It felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail, a trail Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts. Thoughts that wasn’t her thoughts, that was as if they belonged to someone else. It was as if she was seeing things as someone else’s was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. A Coffee Shop, That was owned by Hector’s father.

Also named Hector’ She would also find herself taking with him not only about bikes! But also about different things in general. With one! Being of his son Hector’ for Jenna” very much had a crush on him! Often finding herself dreaming of not only Hector’ but a life being on her own! Making her own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular would walk in as he often would, setting down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. A regular, who was named Voodoo’ Lawrence Fishburne,or at least his friends would call him that. Often finding himself talking to Jenna Ortega’ telling Jenna’ about his own little bike rides. When he was a bike rider from the city! A regular that Jenna’ came know from their talks at the coffee shop.

For Voodoo’ would often tell Jenna’ about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for the many great nights he had here in the mountains when he was younger. Jenna’ always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Voodoo’ would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where I wanted to be buried. That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen! That in the end that this was his home! This was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Jenna’ would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Jenna’ would find herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she had grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Jenna’ for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget. Finding herself there on many occasions just to relax, to think about her life! Thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. Or on one of the many trails that was on the outskirts of town, Jenna’ found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Jenna’ setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below her Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Jenna’ loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Jenna’ was! Never in the same town that she had grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go,

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light.

Thinking to herself 

“Why am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?”

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by. Some she knew, while others being new to the area! Standing there thinking if any of these people could be who they are! Could they be of someone else from somewhere else!

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn’t remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Jenna’ rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Jenna’ that was her Life! Being on her bike loosing herself in the world around her! Racing as the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Jenna’ herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Jenna’ had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Jenna’ and Hector to a race, but not just any race but a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Jenna’ and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times that they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Jenna’ then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Jenna’ are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Jenna’s All I know is how I feel about the Jenna’ that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Jenna’ then giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Jenna’ before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you either! laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Jenna’ that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead.

But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Jenna’ and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. 

The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Jenna’ trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Jenna’ then stopping to check on him as Hector’ then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Jenna! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Jenna’ had caught up to them, for Jenna’ knew the trails like no other. 

Racing hard and fast to the finish side by side! Just as Jenna’ then gave him a look and smile to the outsider as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail! Leaving him setting there as Jenna’ had won the race.

Later that evening Jenna’ and Hector’ would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Jenna’ just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector’ then saying goodbye to Jenna’ as he then headed back to town leaving Jenna’ there for the night.

As she came to the ravine Jenna’ then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Jenna’ had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. 

Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Jenna’ began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Jenna’’ could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Jenna’ would set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Jenna’ lay there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. lying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Jenna’ had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Jenna’ would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she had lived before! Before the town that she lived in now! But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone then called her Jenna’

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light putting her hands up to her head Jenna’ just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this other Jenna’ And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Jenna’ just sat there looking around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Jenna’ began to scream! A calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “Hello Jenna’ it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Jenna’ as Jenna’ then replied saying to himself

“Then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Jenna’ I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Jenna’ then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Jenna’ your dreams.” 

As Jenna’ just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Jenna’ just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Jenna’ and it is not you”

More confused then ever Jenna’ just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Jenna’ standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is not! and you are not. For her Life is her Life! For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Jenna’ then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Jenna’ And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Jenna’

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now! But look for what is to come!  for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Jenna’ for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Jenna’ was now standing there looking out over Angels Ravine, Jenna’ couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then dreams of the girl was now slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come! Living a Life of whatever was to come for Jenna’

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now for it was her town her home. Her Life! With Jenna’ now leaving Angels Ravine, making her way back home, but as usual finding herself racing to beat her own best time.

Jenna’ was now making her way back into in Life, along with Hector by her side, riding through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. For she was now riding into Life! into her 

Life, Living a Life of what she made it. For that day! Jenna Ortega’ had found Grace

1m6hgwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1m6hgwl/why_should_you_choose_the_keurig_ksupreme_coffee/,Why Should You Choose the Keurig K-Supreme Coffee Maker Review?,"The Keurig K-Supreme has completely changed how I brew my coffee every morning. Over the years, I’ve tested countless coffee makers, ranging from basic drip machines to high-end espresso setups. Bringing this sleek and compact coffee maker into the mix, however, surprised me with its simplicity while still delivering a consistently flavorful cup. Let me walk you through my experience after putting it through its paces.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of the Keurig K-Supreme grabbed my attention immediately. It’s modern, understated, and doesn’t take up much counter space. The black finish doesn’t scream for attention, but it blends well with nearly any kitchen aesthetic. Measuring approximately 10 inches deep and 14 inches wide, it fits snugly beside my toaster and doesn’t dominate my countertop. The 66-ounce dual-position removable reservoir is a game-changer for placement options. I appreciated how it gives you flexibility based on available counter space—slide it to the back or adjust it to the side. The removable tank also made refilling a lot less cumbersome.

**Performance and Brewing Experience**  
Testing out its brewing capabilities has been a delightful journey. With its MultiStream Technology, I noticed a definite improvement in the flavor of my coffee. The machine extracts the grounds evenly, unlike older Keurig models I’ve tried, giving every cup a rich, aromatic profile. Whether I went for a strong morning pick-me-up using the “Strong” button or brewed over ice for a refreshing iced coffee, the results consistently impressed me. Having the option to brew in four different sizes—6, 8, 10, or 12 ounces—was perfect for switching between personal cups and larger travel mugs.

[View Keurig K-Supreme sale info on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0892tw82k/)

**User-Friendliness**  
As someone who isn’t the biggest fan of fiddling with countless dials and controls first thing in the morning, I found the button-based interface refreshingly simple. Just pop in a K-Cup, press a button, and you’re minutes away from enjoying freshly brewed coffee. The instructions for use are so intuitive that even my tech-resistant parents had no trouble navigating it during a recent visit. A notable feature here is the maintenance alert, which gently reminds you when to descale the machine after every 250 brews. It’s one of those features that seems small but saves you from having to track it manually.

**Pluses**  
- MultiStream Technology for richer flavor and aroma.  
- Brews multiple cup sizes (6, 8, 10, and 12 oz).  
- Back-to-back brewing with no waiting between cups.  
- 66-oz removable reservoir for fewer refills.  

**Shortcomings**  
- No integrated milk frother; limits latte-making adventures.  
- Slightly noisier than some comparable models during brewing.  

**Energy Efficiency and Maintenance**  
Though it lacks a digital clock or advanced energy-saving features found in some competing models, this coffee maker doesn’t stay powered on unnecessarily. It also heats up quickly, so the overall time you require for back-to-back brewing or a rushed morning coffee is minimal.

**Competing Brands**  
In comparing this machine to other single-serve brewers in its range, the Keurig K-Supreme stands out for its MultiStream Technology. A rival model, the Nespresso Vertuo Next, for instance, has its advantages with creamier output for lattes and cappuccinos, but it doesn’t have adjustable brewing sizes that go beyond espresso shots. Moreover, the Vertuo’s pods can be limiting in variety, whereas the Keurig system allows you to access a vast range of K-Cups or use ground coffee with the reusable filter (sold separately). However, if you prioritize near-silent brewing, the Nespresso has an edge, as the Keurig can get slightly noisy.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Looking at overall value, the Keurig K-Supreme offers a satisfactory balance of price and performance. It caters to those who want versatility in brewing, whether it’s bold or iced options. While some advanced features such as milk frothing are absent, it remains worth its cost given its core capabilities and the flavorful results it delivers. Compared to smaller or more basic brewers in its category, the few extra dollars for MultiStream Technology and a larger reservoir feel justified.

Finding Grace’ A latino story, with Jenna Ortega

Finding Grace’ 

Not really remembering anything from before, Before, a dark raven haired Latina, brown eyed girl named Jenna Ortega’ had awakened into a world in which she would now find herself. Living in a world now where she see meets people that have since passed. But from within her new world that she now lives in, along with the people that she meets along the way. While riding her bike discovering new trails that would show her a life that was once hers. 

From waking up to looking out her window into a world that was still very new to her,  while still giving her the feeling of that she has always been here. With anticipation of what was about to be, Jenna’ a very outgoing dark haired girl! That very much knew how to handle things that would come her way. 

While at the same time meeting new people along the way while finding herself coming closer to some in her life. But as Jenna’ would quickly get dressed, anticipating what the day may bring her. Wearing a black tee and a pair of cut at the knees jeans! Not forgetting about her shoes that just fit her personality that she was to everyone around her. 

A girl that wasn’t afraid to express herself! While at the same time excepting a challenge! From anyone that wanted to race her! With her showing them what was! While at the same time! Finding herself coming closer to others! Knowing that the world around her was changing every day seeing and meeting new people along the way. While at the same time! Finding out that some people around her had many stories of their own to share. Finding herself coming close to some! Whether it was as a friend! or like family to her! 

But as Jenna’ quickly got dressed! Grabbing her bike and on her way she went! Not looking back! But only ahead! Ahead to what was to be! As she was now finding herself. Looking out onto a bustling street in front of her, Jenna’ was going to let nothing stand in her way! From doing this run! A run that she had a done dozens of times before. For just as the morning’s sun was making its way into a new day. A new day for her! For everything seemed new to Jenna’

In a way that was just unexplainable to her! For it felt like she had always been here, lived here! And was born here. But unknowingly to her at the moment, the days ahead would show her different paths. Paths that would take her to slowly finding out who she was. For as sat there on her bike, looking down a street just in front of her was that long all downhill from there. But the need to race! The need for speed was there! And she here now and ready for her run.

With her not always having the feeling of really not knowing on how or why she was here. But in a way she felt that she had always been here, but with her having that feeling in her that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, but she only knew where she was at the moment! only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! Feeling the wind push up against her! Speeding in and around cars along the way!

With the feeling of something just being different about still residing within her, more so than usually toady. With the feeling that all of this still felt very new to her! The surroundings! The people! Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here! That she had always been here.

Jenna’ was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 23rd birthday. Growing up in a small town that had a big city feel to it to her. But to Jenna’ it was her home, but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that one day she would riding her bike through the downtown streets. 

Weaving in and around cars passing by them as the wind blew through her long Raven hair! feeling free from the world around her! Racing was her excitement! And it showed! With her smile saying it all. Making her way through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed them by.

With Jenna’ having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Jenna’! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just him watching out for her! For her own safety.  But Jenna’ also had someone else watching out for her! A young latino! Named Hector’! With his dark hair brown eyes, And a smile For Jenna’! But Jenna’ was just your typical young brown eyed girl! Who liked her shredded jeans and tee shirt and hoodie living her life! Her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Jenna’ being the girl that she was! Never backing down from a challenge, finding herself racing through the towns streets, finding herself racing along with one or two others.

Not to say that one of them didn’t catch her eye, But! From time to time, Hector’ very much would catch her eye, for he was the kinda guy that could charm on a dime. A Latino, Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match! Especially on a bike. Often calling out to Jenna’ saying to her.

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Jenna’ Whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them. Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it. Knowing that Jenna’ was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Jenna’ leaving him with a glance and a smile! as Jenna’ left him looking. And saying to himself “Dam! That’s my girl!”

Just way the way he liked it! Always watching out for her. While Jenna’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different! 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. Finding new trails along the way but with each new trail she would ride. It was like it was showing something to her! As if it was trying to tell her something! 

But with each new day bringing something new to her! A new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself very well on a bike, Jenna’ would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city. Telling Jrnna’ about his own street races, with Jenna’ always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Jenna’ needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go on forever! Dodging in and out of traffic! But always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Jenna’ was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life for her. More than often finding herself thinking about her life! For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life! It felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail, a trail Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts. Thoughts that wasn’t her thoughts, that was as if they belonged to someone else. It was as if she was seeing things as someone else’s was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. A Coffee Shop, That was owned by Hector’s father.

Also named Hector’ She would also find herself taking with him not only about bikes! But also about different things in general. With one! Being of his son Hector’ for Jenna” very much had a crush on him! Often finding herself dreaming of not only Hector’ but a life being on her own! Making her own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular would walk in as he often would, setting down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. A regular, who was named Voodoo’ Lawrence Fishburne,or at least his friends would call him that. Often finding himself talking to Jenna Ortega’ telling Jenna’ about his own little bike rides. When he was a bike rider from the city! A regular that Jenna’ came know from their talks at the coffee shop.

For Voodoo’ would often tell Jenna’ about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for the many great nights he had here in the mountains when he was younger. Jenna’ always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Voodoo’ would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where I wanted to be buried. That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen! That in the end that this was his home! This was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Jenna’ would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Jenna’ would find herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she had grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Jenna’ for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget. Finding herself there on many occasions just to relax, to think about her life! Thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. Or on one of the many trails that was on the outskirts of town, Jenna’ found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Jenna’ setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below her Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Jenna’ loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Jenna’ was! Never in the same town that she had grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go,

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light.

Thinking to herself 

“Why am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?”

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by. Some she knew, while others being new to the area! Standing there thinking if any of these people could be who they are! Could they be of someone else from somewhere else!

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn’t remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Jenna’ rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Jenna’ that was her Life! Being on her bike loosing herself in the world around her! Racing as the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Jenna’ herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Jenna’ had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Jenna’ and Hector to a race, but not just any race but a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Jenna’ and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times that they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Jenna’ then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Jenna’ are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Jenna’s All I know is how I feel about the Jenna’ that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Jenna’ then giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Jenna’ before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you either! laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Jenna’ that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead.

But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Jenna’ and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. 

The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Jenna’ trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Jenna’ then stopping to check on him as Hector’ then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Jenna! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Jenna’ had caught up to them, for Jenna’ knew the trails like no other. 

Racing hard and fast to the finish side by side! Just as Jenna’ then gave him a look and smile to the outsider as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail! Leaving him setting there as Jenna’ had won the race.

Later that evening Jenna’ and Hector’ would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Jenna’ just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector’ then saying goodbye to Jenna’ as he then headed back to town leaving Jenna’ there for the night.

As she came to the ravine Jenna’ then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Jenna’ had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. 

Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Jenna’ began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Jenna’’ could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Jenna’ would set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Jenna’ lay there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. lying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Jenna’ had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Jenna’ would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she had lived before! Before the town that she lived in now! But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone then called her Jenna’

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light putting her hands up to her head Jenna’ just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this other Jenna’ And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Jenna’ just sat there looking around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Jenna’ began to scream! A calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “Hello Jenna’ it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Jenna’ as Jenna’ then replied saying to himself

“Then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Jenna’ I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Jenna’ then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Jenna’ your dreams.” 

As Jenna’ just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Jenna’ just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Jenna’ and it is not you”

More confused then ever Jenna’ just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Jenna’ standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is not! and you are not. For her Life is her Life! For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Jenna’ then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Jenna’ And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Jenna’

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now! But look for what is to come!  for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Jenna’ for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Jenna’ was now standing there looking out over Angels Ravine, Jenna’ couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then dreams of the girl was now slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come! Living a Life of whatever was to come for Jenna’

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now for it was her town her home. Her Life! With Jenna’ now leaving Angels Ravine, making her way back home, but as usual finding herself racing to beat her own best time.

Jenna’ was now making her way back into in Life, along with Hector by her side, riding through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. For she was now riding into Life! into her 

Life, Living a Life of what she made it. For that day! Jenna Ortega’ had found Grace

1m6hep9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1m6hep9/what_makes_the_chantal_mia_electric_kettle_a/,What Makes the Chantal Mia Electric Kettle a Must-Have for Your Kitchen?,"I’ve had the chance to try out the Chantal Mia Electric Kettle, ELSL37-03M-XX for the past few weeks, and let me just say, it’s been an interesting addition to my kitchen. With a sleek marigold finish and compact design, it stands out on my countertop in the best way. But there’s more to this kettle than its aesthetic charm—it’s brimming with features that make it a solid choice for everyday tasks. Of course, nothing’s perfect, and I’ll dive into where it shines and where it stumbles. Here’s my honest take.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was the kettle's bold marigold color, which adds a pop of vibrancy to any kitchen. Its stainless-steel finish doesn’t just look premium—it feels durable, too. I appreciate the fact that it’s constructed entirely of 304 food-grade stainless steel. There’s no plastic on the inside, which gave me peace of mind knowing there’s no risk of BPA leaching into my water. The lightweight design, at just 2.3 pounds, made it easy to handle, even when it was full to its 32-ounce capacity. I’ve owned bulkier kettles in the past, and this one feels delightfully compact without sacrificing functionality.

**Ease of Use and Ergonomics**  
One of the highlights for me was how user-friendly the kettle is. The ergonomic handle feels comfortable, even for extended periods, and the wide-opening lid makes filling and cleaning surprisingly hassle-free. I frequently make tea and pour-over coffee, and the kettle's patented dual-function spout is an absolute game-changer. Whether I need a slow, controlled pour for my pour-over, or a quicker stream for other tasks, it adapts seamlessly. Plus, the spout design cools the water slightly to an ideal brewing temperature of 205ºF—a thoughtful touch I didn’t know I needed until I tried it.

**[Check Chantal Mia Electric Kettle ELSL37-03M-XX price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b0944bql4c/)**  

**Performance and Heating Speed**  
This kettle is no slouch when it comes to doing its job. Powered by a 1000W base, it heats water quickly and operates so quietly I sometimes forget it’s on. I use this for a range of tasks, from morning tea and mid-afternoon coffee to quick bowls of oatmeal. It handles everything effortlessly. The 360-degree cordless connector is another smart feature, allowing me to pick it up and place it back down at any angle, which is perfect, especially during busy mornings when every second counts.

**Safety Features**  
Safety is a non-negotiable feature for me, especially when I’m using something as powerful as an electric kettle. The automatic shut-off worked flawlessly every single time, and the boil-dry protection gave me an added layer of reassurance. Not every kettle pays this kind of attention to detail, so I have to give kudos here. The indicator light is straightforward and lets you know when the kettle is on, so there’s no guesswork.

**Key Benefits**  
- Stylish marigold color and compact design.  
- Durable and safe 304 stainless steel construction.  
- Innovative dual-function spout for slow or fast pouring.  
- Quick and quiet water heating with a 1000W base.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The 32-ounce capacity might feel limiting for larger families.  
- While efficient, some features might seem niche unless you’re a pour-over enthusiast.  

**Competing Products**  
When stacked against competitors like the Fellow Stagg or the Bonavita Variable Temperature Kettle, I found the Chantal Mia Electric Kettle to be a more compact and cost-effective option. The Fellow Stagg excels in precise temperature control and design, but it comes with a higher price tag that might not be justifiable unless you’re a hardcore coffee aficionado. Similarly, Bonavita offers exceptional temperature control but lacks the aesthetic charm and lightweight build of this one. This kettle finds a unique middle ground—it’s stylish, functional, and doesn’t try to oversell features most users won’t need.

**Price Performance**  
Considering everything it offers, I’d say the Chantal Mia Electric Kettle delivers great value for money. Its mix of safety, speed, and versatility at this price point is hard to beat. Competitors might offer added bells and whistles, but you often end up paying significantly more for features you may never use. For everyday functionality with some thoughtful extras, this kettle is absolutely worth considering.

Got that feeling in the bones, no time to waste away
Coffee's brewing, playlist pumpin', setting the right tone
Got a feeling in the chest, ready to be known
Used to dim the light, play it safe and stay so quiet
But the universe called, told it's time for a riot, yeah

Steppin' out the door, glitter on the skin
Feel that energy risin', like where to even begin?
Got confidence buzzin', a little dangerous, a little sweet
Every step taken, a rhythm in the street

So try to keep up, if you think you're ready
This ain't no slow dance, baby, this groove is steady
Got a own beat, marching to the own drum
If you're not in sync, you're gonna feel so numb
Yeah, movin' too fast, for the weak and the weary
So try to keep up, if you want this kinda theory

Messages are blowing up, from the ones who didn't see
The vision building, just waiting to be free
Now they're watching from the sidelines, wondering what's the secret
It's just self-love, baby, planted like a seedling
Used to crave validation, every word they'd send
Now validate self, until the very end

No time for doubts, no time for second guesses
Writing the own story, no more petty stresses
Learned the lessons hard, and came out shining bright
Now taking every chance, soaking up the light

The mug is dishwasher safe but still looks stained after cleaning.

I’m looking for safe and effective cleaning methods or homemade solutions that won’t damage the porcelain or affect the mug’s finish. I prefer to avoid harsh chemicals if possible.

We started talking due to a mutual friend passing away. We have not seen each other since high school. We live about an hour away from each other. He was helping me navigate caring for my mom while she went through chemo because he had been his dad's primary caregiver for several years. Those conversations evolved into more personal topics and soon we were talking online all day everyday. I started to develop feelings for him, but I knew he was online all the time, even when we weren't talking, so I asked him if there was anyone else he had a relationship with online (I knew he wasn't married) and he admitted that there was. He has someone else he had romantic conversations with and they had been talking for several months. She lives in another state. He said he had been pulling away from that ""situationship"" since we began talking, but had not ended it with her. That made me uncomfortable, and I shifted the conversations back to just talking about caregiving. My mom ended up passing away and he was very supportive and a great friend. Slowly the conversations again moved into more romantic topics. He told me he had begun to have feelings for me and asked me to meet for coffee. I asked if he had ended the other ""situationship"" and he admitted that he hadn't. He said that the conversations had dwindled and he had been giving her excuses, but hadn't told her the truth. I pulled away again. He apologized and said he would end things with her, he just will miss her friendship. Fast forward to today (2 months later) he still hasn't ended the situationship. (she is going through a rough time and he doesn't want to add to her problems right now) and he and I are also still talking romantically. I will not see him in person while he is involved with someone else. I don't think he really wants to end things with her. So, we are at an impasse. He is sweet, funny, caring. I know he doesn't want to hurt this other woman, but I am doubting that he will ever end things with her. I just want a normal, in-person, relationship with him but I don't want to wait around for him to decide. I can see him in person and just hope that he eventually ends the relationship with her, I can insist we just be friends (not sure it is possible), or end contact. I don't want to give him an ultimatum. I don't think that is healthy for a relationship.",1,1753198647.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

That day, I had pushed myself too hard during a run and ended up overeating afterward. I felt bloated and couldn’t digest my food well. It resolved in a few days, but that incident marked the first time I *ever* experienced such symptoms — **bloating, indigestion, and a tight feeling in my stomach and chest**.

Over the next few months, these symptoms returned — worse this time. From **October 2023 to February 2024**, the bloating, indigestion, chest tightness, and shallow breathing became a constant issue. Running — my main goal and training focus — became extremely difficult. Imagine trying to run with a bloated stomach and restricted breathing. It was frustrating, and I had no clue why this was happening.

# Doctor Visit — Tryptoxa Introduced

By December 2023, I went to a doctor. He prescribed **Tryptoxa (Amitriptyline 10 mg)** — a low-dose tricyclic antidepressant — along with a digestive enzyme syrup. At the time, I thought he was crazy. I didn’t feel “depressed,” so why was I being given an antidepressant?

Still, I took it — mostly because it helped me sleep better (7–8 hours), especially during the hot summer months. But I didn’t give much credit to Tryptoxa. I believed it was things like **Betaine HCL, digestive enzymes, ACV, ajwain-saunf water**, etc., that were helping me with digestion. I kept taking those regularly and assumed *they* were fixing my gut issues. Meanwhile, Tryptoxa became a background supplement — something I took “just for sleep.”

# The Moment of Truth

In **August 2024**, the weather cooled down. I stopped taking Tryptoxa because my sleep improved naturally. Within **15 days**, boom — my symptoms returned: bloating, chest tightness, indigestion, and that awful shallow breathing.

This pattern continued from **August 2024 to February 2025**. I was extremely careful with my diet — no junk, no overeating — but the issue stayed. It made running painful. My aerobic capacity took a hit, and training became inconsistent.

Then, in **March 2025**, summer returned. I restarted Tryptoxa for sleep again — without connecting it to digestion. Coincidentally (or so I thought), all my symptoms disappeared again: I could eat protein-rich food, train hard, and recover well. My digestion improved. I assumed it was due to **Betaine HCL** and strict food habits.

But in **June 2025**, I stopped taking Tryptoxa again. And within a few days, the same old bloating, indigestion, and breathing discomfort returned — *even though my diet was still perfect*.

# Connecting the Dots

This time, I was completely fed up. I retraced everything: my supplements, meals, food combinations, routines — **nothing made sense**. Then suddenly, I remembered: *Tryptoxa*. It had been the one common factor every time I recovered — not the enzymes, not ACV, not ajwain, not Betaine HCL. Even coffee — which normally bloats me — didn't cause issues while I was on Tryptoxa.

So, this time I took **Tryptoxa 5 mg intentionally**, hoping it would fix my digestion.  
And guess what?  
From the **second day**, my stomach started feeling lighter.  
By the **fourth day**, my shallow breathing was gone.

As of now — it's been 10 days on 5 mg — I’ve stopped every other digestive aid. No ACV, no enzymes, no ajwain-saunf, nothing. Just Betaine HCL with two big meals (and even that’s optional now). I'm even drinking **3–4 cups of black coffee a day**, and it’s not causing any bloating. This never happened before.

# What Do I Think Now?

I think my issue wasn’t purely digestive. It was something **functional — most likely psychosomatic**. Functional Dyspepsia is often linked to **gut-brain imbalance**. Tryptoxa, although technically an antidepressant, is commonly prescribed off-label in small doses for **IBS, functional dyspepsia, and visceral hypersensitivity**. It's not about depression — it's about calming the **nerves connected to the gut**. It also improves **sleep**, reduces **gut motility issues**, and balances **neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine** in the gut wall.

I didn't have textbook depression, but I likely had **autonomic nervous system imbalance**, or some form of **somatization** — where stress or neural tension messes with physical functions. This wasn’t “in my head” — it was **real symptoms caused by nervous system distress**, and Tryptoxa fixed it.

1m6hbis,https://i.redd.it/jh3i61aiufef1.png,"I Won't Give My Heart to You | Right after Elie Roberts submitted her resignation, her mom called.","Chapter 1

Right after Elie Roberts submitted her resignation, her mom called.

""Elie, how's the resignation going?""

""I've already turned it in. I'll officially be out in a month.""

""That's great,"" her mom said, sounding more cheerful. ""The friends in town and I picked out a few decent boys for you. Meet them when you're back, okay? Let's try to get you engaged this year.""

Then she sighed. ""And stop thinking about that heir from the Lawrence family. He's from a whole different world. We're not the same.""

Elie's throat tightened, eyes started to tear up. ""It's okay, Mom. I get it. I'll be back after I finish the handover.""

After hanging up, Elie started packing up her desk.

Years at the Lawrence Group had left her with way too much to sort through. She was only halfway done when her phone vibrated again.

It was a message from Clara Grayson: a location pin, followed by two words, ""Come over.""

The address was none other than Eric Lawrence's villa.

Twenty minutes later, Elie was standing at his front door.

The front door was ajar, so she pushed it open and walked in. Clara was standing in the middle of the living room, holding a bracelet.

Elie's heart sank. She was sure she'd cleared everything out when she moved out of this place. How did something get left behind?

Before she could react, Clara slapped her across the face.

""I've been trying to figure out who was with Eric while I was abroad, and I never would've guessed—it was you, my best friend!

""Elie, with that plain face and flat figure? You really think you could seduce Eric?""

Elie trembled, shame crashing over her like a wave.

""Clara, it was a mistake between him and me. And we're just friends with benefits... It only happened after you two broke up. I never crossed the line before that.""

Smack!

Clara slapped her again. ""Breakup or not, Eric will always be mine. Who do you think you are?""

This one hit harder—Elie felt blood at the corner of her mouth. When Clara raised her hand for a third slap, Elie finally caught her wrist.

""Elie, what do you think you're doing?!""

The icy voice came from behind just before she was yanked away with force.

She stumbled and fell to the marble floor, her knee slamming against it with a sharp pain that made her gasp.

Eric stood in front of Clara, shielding her. His black suit made him look even taller and more imposing, but the coldness in his eyes made her shiver.

Clara's tears fell right away. ""Eric, I found out about you and Elie. My best friend and my ex... I was just upset and asked her a few questions, and she tried to hit me.""

""I didn't! She—""

""Enough,"" Eric snapped, cutting Elie off. But when he turned to Clara, his expression softened instantly, even a little panicked. ""Clara, what happened with Elie was a mistake. I just missed you so much that I lost control. You came back, and I chose you. Doesn't that prove who I love?""

Elie's heart felt like it was being crushed in someone's fist.

So that was it. In his eyes, she wasn't even a replacement—just a way to vent his desire.

Clara looked up at him, eyes full of tears. ""Are you sure you don't love her?""

""I don't,"" Eric said flatly, without a moment of hesitation.

""Okay,"" Clara said, pointing at Elie. ""Then prove it. Tell your bodyguards to strip her.""

Elie's whole body went cold. She turned to Eric, but he just stood there in silence, frowning.

""I knew you couldn't let her go!"" Clara shouted. ""Fine then, I'm leaving. I hope you're happy together!""

The words had barely left her mouth when Eric grabbed her arm and gave an order to the guards by the door. ""Do it.""

The two guards stepped forward. Elie struggled desperately, but she was no match for their strength.

""No... please, don't...""

The sound of fabric tearing echoed harshly through the villa. In seconds, her shirt buttons popped off, her skirt was ripped, and her bra strap snapped...

Just as the last shred of clothing was torn away, Eric finally spoke, ""Enough.

""Get her out of here. I don't want to see you again.""

Elie covered her body and stumbled out the door.

She heard Eric's gentle voice behind her. ""Clara, don't be mad...""

Rain poured hard, stinging against her exposed skin, but it still wasn't nearly as cold as what she felt inside.

She clutched the shredded fabric to her chest, struggling forward in the heavy rain. Rain mixed with tears, running into her mouth, bitter and salty.

And then, like a flood, the past came crashing down on her.

Back in college, Eric was every girl's dream—tall, handsome, and the star of the basketball court. Every game he played brought out a chorus of screaming fans.

Clara was the campus belle—beautiful, fair-skinned, and from a wealthy family.

Elie, on the other hand, was practically invisible. Ordinary looks, ordinary life—nothing that stood out.

Then one day during lunch, Clara suddenly sat down across from her with a tray and a dazzling smile.

""Eating alone is so boring. Let's eat together from now on.""

That was the day Elie became Clara's so-called best friend.

People always said Clara was so nice for hanging out with someone like Elie, the ugly duckling.

But Elie knew the truth. Clara only kept her around to make herself shine brighter.

Then one day, Eric entered their little circle.

At first, Elie thought he liked her. That evening, when a few thugs cornered her in an alley, it was Eric who stepped in to help. The way he stood there, backlit by the sunset, became the brightest memory of her youth.

But it didn't take long for her to realize that Eric only got close to her to pursue Clara.

Because the easiest way was through her best friend.

Even so, Elie helped him.

She could still remember all the times she praised Eric in front of Clara—how she always found excuses to slip away when they were together, and how her diary was filled with ""Eric,"" written again and again, though no one ever knew.

After that, she became like an NPC in their story, watching Eric win Clara over and treat her like a queen.

She thought she'd spend the rest of her life watching them go from dating to marriage, and then having kids.

But everything changed right before graduation, when Clara suddenly broke up with him and left for overseas without looking back.

Eric chased her to the airport and stood in the rain for a full day and night, but all he got was her walking away without a glance.

During that time, Elie stayed by his side.

When he drank too much, she picked up the empty bottles.

When he hit rock bottom, she quietly kept his life in order.

Eventually, she even became his secretary, managing both his work and personal life.

Then came that night at the business banquet. Eric had been drugged. When she was reaching for her phone to call a doctor, he lost control and pushed her down on the lounge sofa.

Afterward, he didn't even look at her. Still, she couldn't forget the heat of his skin, the sound of his heavy breathing.

It happened a few more times after that, always after he got drunk.

He never kissed her, never looked her in the eye. Just coldly used her.

They'd been friends with benefits for three years.

But the moment Clara came back a month ago, Eric went right back to her without hesitation.

That was when Elie realized it was time to walk away.

So she quietly turned in her resignation and agreed to go back home for the blind dates her mom had set up.

What she didn't expect was that even after all that, Clara still wouldn't let her go.

Elie returned home, drenched from head to toe, when her phone lit up.

She checked it and saw a large bank transfer from Eric. The note was just a cold word, ""Compensation.""

Then another message popped up. ""I know you like me.""

She stared at the screen, her breath catching in her throat.

So he had known all along.

Every stolen glance, every planned ""coincidence,"" the little acts of ""accidental"" kindness—she thought she'd hidden it so well.

""But we were never possible.

""Clara was just too upset today.

""Don't take it personally.

""And don't you dare get jealous and hurt her.""

Each message hit like a knife to the heart.

Elie laughed out loud, laughing so hard that tears spilled from her eyes.

She thought back to all those years.

When he held her while drunk, calling out Clara's name, she held back tears.

When she slipped his birthday gift in with a pile of packages, too afraid to even sign her name.

When he kissed her in the office, he always covered her eyes.

So he'd known all along.

Her fingers hovered over the screen for a long time. Then, finally, she replied, ""Don't worry, Mr. Lawrence. I'll never like you again.""

Chapter 2

The moment she hit send, she sank into a bathtub filled with water.

Bubbles slowly rose to the surface, like the love she had buried all these years, finally sinking for good.

The next day, Elie continued to go to work.

But she was shocked to find a photo of her, soaked on her way home, had gone viral online.

""Flat as a board and still dares to run naked? I wouldn't even look if she walked past me! She's clearly desperate for fame. She's gone crazy trying to gain views!""

""Look at how miserable she looks—doesn't seem like she's trying to gain attention, more like a homewrecker who got beaten up! Serves her right. Shameless woman messing with someone else's relationship. Why couldn't she just get hit by a car?""

Reading the cruel, hateful comments, Elie felt awful, but there was nothing she could do.

Worried her mom might see the photos, she anxiously kept scrolling and spent the whole morning reporting them.

Online discussions only grew more intense until someone tried to dox the woman in the photo. But within minutes, the entire trending topic was wiped, and all photos and videos vanished without a trace.

Elie had no idea why, but it brought her a sense of relief.

She forced herself to act normal and got back to work. When she brought some documents to Eric for a signature, she walked in on Clara angrily confronting him.

""You're the one who took down the trending topic, aren't you? No one else has that kind of power! Why would you do that? Do you like her?""

Elie froze; she hadn't expected it to be Eric.

Eric looked at Clara with a frown, clearly frustrated.

""I did take it down, but it's not what you think. She's my assistant. If her identity were exposed, it could hurt the company's stock. I swear, I don't have any feelings for her. Clara, I only like you. Please, believe me.""

Clara was about to say more, but Eric suddenly pulled her into his arms and kissed her, cutting off her words.

She struggled at first, but his skilled and gentle kiss slowly made her give in, her breathing growing unsteady.

Elie stood outside the door, watching the scene, feeling cold all over.

So this was what it looked like when he kissed someone he loved.

His long fingers slipped into her hair, gently pulling her into his arms, eyes filled with undeniable possessiveness and affection.

In three years, he'd done everything intimate with her—except kiss her.

She should've known then. It was because he didn't love her.

A sharp pain struck her heart. Just as she turned to leave, a coffee cup suddenly came flying toward her.

She stumbled and fell hard to the floor, a gash opening on her forehead from the hit. As she raised her hand to cover the wound, Clara's angry voice rang out.

""How long have you been spying at the door? Do you enjoy watching people kissing?""

Elie lowered her head, her voice hoarse as she tried to explain she was just there to deliver documents.

But Clara walked over coldly, lifted her heel, and crushed Elie's hand, grinding down hard on the fingers still clutching the papers.

""Ah!""

The papers were crushed under the pressure, and Elie's hand was scraped, blood seeping through the torn skin.

Her body trembled from the pain, but Clara clung to Eric's arm and started to complain.

""Eric, look—she's not just a liar; she's incompetent. She ruined the documents, too. Can't you just fire her?""

Eric's gaze darkened. He stayed silent for a moment before speaking quietly, ""She's handling several important contracts right now. I can't fire her for now.""

Clara looked at him suspiciously, her tone laced with dissatisfaction. ""Can't or don't want to?""

Chapter 3

Eric lowered his voice and coaxed her, ""I do have work to handle, and I can't afford delays. If it were just about firing a secretary, why would I lie to you?""

Clara still wouldn't let it go. ""Fine, don't fire her. Then make her stay on her knees at the company entrance for a whole day. Is that okay?""

This time, Eric agreed and looked over at Elie.

""These contracts are tied to a major deal. You either pay eight million, or stay on your knees at the entrance for a day.""

Elie knew he was doing this to appease Clara.

There was no way she could come up with eight million, so she staggered to her feet and, enduring the humiliation, stayed on her knees at the front door.

She hung her head low, hiding the burn in her eyes, while the chatter of passing coworkers reached her ears.

""Isn't she Mr. Lawrence's most trusted secretary? Why's she on her knees out here in front of everyone? So embarrassing.""

""I saw it too. She didn't do anything wrong. She just pissed off Ms. Grayson and got punished for it.""

""Ms. Grayson is Mr. Lawrence's first love. Even after all these years apart, he still isn't over her. Messing with Ms. Grayson? Yeah, she had it coming.""

Each word stabbed into Elie like a needle, making it hard to breathe.

She suddenly thought back to school. On Clara's birthday, some boys had made fun of her, saying she was the cow dung that highlighted the campus belle.

Everyone burst into laughter. She'd bolted, hiding in the stairwell.

It was Eric who found her there, handing her a pack of tissues.

""Don't worry about others. Just focus on yourself, that's enough.""

Even now, Elie still remembered those words.

She always thought Eric saw something special in her, and that's why he kept her close. She gave everything to her work, never complained, and always did her best.

But the moment Clara came back, he threw all her years of hard work and loyalty aside, just for Clara.

Yeah... In the end, she was just a secretary he could fire at will.

Now that she was no longer useful, it was time to leave.

Elie stayed on her knees all day. Her skin was torn and bleeding, and the pain made it nearly impossible to walk.

When work ended, she limped back to the office to grab her bag and ran into Eric.

He glanced at her injuries and frowned slightly.

""Take a few days off. Get some rest. Come back when you're better.""

Elie murmured, ""Okay,"" without looking at him, then turned and walked away.

Once she got home, she treated her wounds and started packing her things.

The moment Clara's return made the news, Eric had told her to move out of the villa.

Back then, she'd left in a hurry, just tossed everything into a box, making a mess.

Now that she was going back to her hometown, she figured it was time to clean things up properly.

She got rid of the jewelry Eric gave her, the photos she'd secretly taken while he was asleep, the diary where she wrote about her crush on him at the university, and all the other little things.

Every now and then, gossip from the office group chat would pop up.

When Clara came back from shopping with sore legs, Eric got down to his knees and gave her a massage. When she complained the office lights were too bright, he had the entire building's lighting replaced overnight. When she was in a bad mood, he canceled all his meetings just to accompany her.

Elie kept scrolling quietly, repeating to herself, ""It'll be over soon. Just hang in there.""

Once her injuries healed, it was time for the company's annual party.

Eric showed up with Clara, and the whole room burst into applause. Everyone was saying how perfect they were for each other—rich, good-looking, a match made in heaven.

He helped Clara down the stage, fixed her dress, took off his jacket to put around her shoulders, and turned down the drinks others tried to toast her with.

Elie sat quietly in a corner, watching the way Eric smiled at Clara. She lowered her eyes silently.

Then came the award ceremony.

Just like every year, Elie won Employee of the Year.

With all eyes on her, Elie stepped onto the stage. The screen behind her started playing a slideshow of her accomplishments over the past year.

She adjusted the mic, ready to give her speech, but suddenly, there was a commotion in the audience.

People were whispering and looking at her with odd expressions.

Chapter 4

Elie's eyelid twitched. Something was wrong. She turned around and saw her PPT had been swapped.

The screen was now showing humiliating photos from college, ones that had been secretly taken without her knowing.

Mixed in were censored bed photos, in which her face was clearly visible.

Elie knew right away that those photos came from Eric's villa security footage.

Her whole body went cold, and her mind went blank. She glanced instinctively toward Eric.

He was frowning, but Clara beside him wore a smug, taunting grin.

Elie immediately knew it was her doing. Anger rushed up, and she stepped forward, ready to ask what it would take for Clara to finally leave her alone.

Eric's expression darkened as he stepped in front of her, his voice icy cold.

""What are you doing? Not feeling humiliated enough? Remember, you're just a secretary!""

With tears in her eyes, Elie looked at him. ""Mr. Lawrence, yes, I'm just a secretary, but I'm still a person. Don't I deserve respect? She deliberately showed those photos—

""Enough! Stop acting crazy here!"" Eric snapped, his face dark.

He called the security guards over and had her kicked out.

In front of everyone, they grabbed her by the hair and dragged her out, humiliated her, then shoved her down the high stairs.

She tumbled down, bruised all over, blood seeping out and staining the floor red.

A sharp, tearing pain shot through her whole body, hitting every nerve.

Tears she'd been holding back finally spilled over, clouding her eyes.

She curled up, hugging herself tightly, and slowly blacked out.

When she opened her eyes again, she was in a hospital.

She stared blankly at the ceiling for a long time, then picked up her phone. The office group chat was flooded with talk about the annual party.

Someone had even shared videos and photos, mocking her without holding back.

""Elie's not even that pretty, but turns out she's so wild in private? I thought she was frigid with that cold expression, but she's just a shameless flirt. No idea which guy she's messing around with, but taking that many photos? She must be thirsty.""

""Frigid? She's been all over Mr. Lawrence at work, basically throwing herself at him. Lucky for him, he's only into Ms. Grayson and has never fallen for someone that low.""

""A gold-digger using her body to climb the ranks, like she could ever compare to Ms. Grayson. It's a total insult. Honestly, she should just save herself the embarrassment and leave. If she stays, she's just making a fool of herself.""

Each word felt like a dull knife slicing into Elie's heart, causing unbearable pain.

Her palm was torn up from clenching so hard, and she bit down until her teeth ached. She was finally barely holding it together.

She had no idea how much time had passed before the ward door opened.

When she looked up, a male coworker from the planning team walked in, holding a cup of water.

""Elie, you're awake! How do you feel? Want me to get the doctor?""

Elie was a little dazed, then shook her head.

""I'm okay. Was it you who brought me here?""

Marcus Schmidt scratched his head awkwardly, giving her a shy smile.

""Yeah, I saw you passed out by the door and got worried, so I brought you to the hospital. Luckily, the doctor said it was just stress.""

The word ""passed out"" brought back memories of the company party, and Elie's face froze.

Marcus realized he'd said the wrong thing and quickly went quiet.

The room stayed silent for a long time before he finally spoke up carefully. ""Elie, don't let those rumors get to you. They're not mad because you did anything wrong, but because they have a prejudice against you. Someone's definitely trying to hurt you by photoshopping those pictures. You can call the police, or if you don't want to deal with that pressure, I can help you. You can just say you're in a normal relationship...""

When she saw his ears turning bright red, Elie recalled how he'd always find random excuses to talk to her, and how he'd bring her coffee or snacks every now and then.

Only then did she realize that Marcus probably had a thing for her.

But she'd only ever seen him as a colleague, and she'd already made up her mind to leave.

So when he hinted at his feelings, Elie forced a small smile and politely turned him down.

""Thanks for your concern, but I can handle this on my own.""

Marcus looked a little crushed, but he wasn't backing down.

He reached under the bed, pulled out a bunch of roses, and nervously handed them to her.

He stammered, ""I-I've liked you for a while now. I just never had the guts to say it. I know the timing's not great, but I wanted to try. Could you give me a chance? Maybe we could try being together—""

Marcus didn't even get to finish his words before the door was kicked open.

Startled, they both turned toward the noise—Eric stood there, furious, with a sullen face.

He glared at Marcus as he spat out, ""Get out!""

Chapter 5

Intimidated by Eric's overpowering presence, Marcus shot to his feet and rushed out of the ward, bowing as he left.

Eric slammed the door behind him, then turned to the flowers beside Elie.

""So, he's into you and told you how he feels?""

Elie met his gaze but stayed quiet.

Without waiting for an answer, Eric grabbed the roses and tossed them out the window.

Elie had rejected Marcus, but she didn't want his feelings to be treated like trash.

She pulled out her IV to pick up the flowers, but Eric caught her wrist and pushed her back onto the bed.

He stared her down, eyes cold as ice.

""What are you doing? It's just a crappy bouquet. Don't tell me you like him too?""

Elie pushed him away and said coldly, ""Mr. Lawrence, you're just my boss. Who I'm with is none of your business.""

Eric's expression darkened, and he gripped her wrist so hard it left red marks.

""Yeah, but don't forget company policy says no office relationships. If you even think about saying yes to him, he's out of the Lawrence Group tomorrow.""

Elie knew he always meant what he said, and she didn't want to drag anyone else into this, so she told the truth. ""I don't like him, and I'm not planning to be with him.""

Only then did Eric's expression ease a little. He let go of her hand and finally got to the real reason he came.

""It was indeed Clara who changed the photo at the annual party. But now that she knows the truth, it's understandable she's mad at you. Once things settle down, I'll promote you to head of the secretary department, and your salary will double. Just focus on your work. Clara agreed this was the last time. She won't come after you again, so don't hold it against her anymore.""

His offer sounded great, but Elie wasn't moved.

She took a deep breath, about to tell him she was resigning.

But before she could speak, Clara's call came in.

""Eric, I want to go to the beach for a few days. Will you come with me?""

Eric spoke to her gently, leaving Elie behind without a second thought as he walked out.

He left in such a rush that he didn't hear what she said.

""I don't need a promotion because I already turned in my resignation.""

As the door closed behind him, Elie looked down.

""Forget it. He'll find out sooner or later,"" she thought to herself.

In the days that followed, while Eric stayed with Clara, Elie went back to work like nothing had happened.

Marcus was transferred back to his hometown branch the very next day. Elie didn't even get to see him one last time.

People at the office still gave her weird looks, but no one brought up the annual party anymore.

Things had finally calmed down. Elie went to the HR department to ask if she could leave early.

The HR staff looked troubled. ""Ms. Roberts, if you want to resign early, you'll need Mr. Lawrence's special approval.""

Elie nodded and got to work on her early resignation request.

Right as she was about to find Eric for a signature, he called and sent her an address, telling her to come immediately.

When she got to the private room at the club, Elie realized Eric's friends—and Clara—were all there, laughing and playing games.

As soon as he saw her, Eric looked up and nodded toward the drinks on the table.

""Clara lost a few rounds, but she's on her period and can't drink. You drink for her. 1.5 thousand dollars per glass.""

Elie knew Eric had damaged his stomach from drinking too much in the past. Now he couldn't touch any alcohol at all.

Otherwise, he would drink for Clara himself.

Elie looked at the dozen or so glasses of whiskey on the table.

She said quietly, ""Mr. Lawrence, it's after work hours. I have the right to refuse this assignment. But if you insist I drink for her, I don't want the money; I just want your signature.""

Eric frowned slightly. ""Signature? For what?""

Elie handed him the resignation form. He was just about to open it when Clara tugged on his arm, pouting.

""Eric, I lost again. Hurry up and make her drink for me!""

Eric responded gently to her and didn't bother reading the form.

He signed it without hesitation and tossed the pen back.

""All done. Now drink.""

Chapter 6

Elie slipped the agreement into her bag and downed her drink.

She kept going, glass after glass, until her stomach was in knots and she felt like throwing up.

After forcing down the last one, she got up, swaying, heading for the bathroom, but Eric's friends blocked her path.

First time doing this and ~~hopefully~~ the last too. I thought I could play Dps for once without needing my friends to let me ""play"" anything else besides Tank.

Tank/Healer E-Couple refusing to Tank/Heal. Not proud of my own attitude either, but am just the difficult piece of shit type that treats others the same on how I am getting treated in this case.

I wish for whenever I am tanking a duty that   
\- People pull ahead, making it easier for me since I am mostlikely snacking on the side. Obviously going to grab mobs and the like off them. You pull, I tank. We pull, we kill.  
\- Healers use rescue on me for when they are already running ahead and that single mob is close to dying and my sprint is on cooldown.  
\- Healers to keep dpsing while invuln is still going. ANY tank has the means to recover their own HP by pressing a few more buttons besides their AoE combo/mits in lvl 100s, probably applies to above 70ish too.

It featured 2-4 guys searching for an elderly woman’s female relative—possibly her daughter, niece, or someone close—who’s living in a small treehouse in the woods with another girl. The girls have a hippie vibe, very connected to nature.

Toward the end, when the guys meet the girls, one of them asks for his name and when he told them she responds with: *“And what is your forest name?”* That line really stuck with me.

There is also a line I remember where when the guys are in the treehouse with the girls one of the girls was reminiscing about the time that when it rained before they would go out and be naked together to bathe in the rain. Later in the movie, it is nighttime, and the guys are not with the girls while they are walking in the woods when it is raining. One of the guys started making a comment about how the two girls are probably naked and bathing in the rain right now.

At the end of the film, it's revealed that the older woman actually owns Starbucks, and the hippie girl is the one set to inherit it. The whole time one of or all of them thought it was just a coffee pot that she was to inherit. The hippie girl, that is set to inherit, reveals it by saying about the fact that the old lady owns a coffee shop called Starbucks, unaware of the fact that it is a popular coffee chain. There’s also a guy trying to stop or interfere with one of the girls because he doesn't want her to have the inheritance.

I just remembered about it after I woke up from my sleep. Now, this is bothering me and I want to know what it is, so any help would be amazing, thanks in advance.

Edit: I forgot to mention I saw this on TV in the USA. Not sure where more specifically because I was moving around alot growing up but probably either Las Vegas, NV or Phoenix, AZ.",1,1753198261.0,tipofmytongue,6,1.0,False

I’ve always enjoyed cleaning the house for my wife, and cooking. The house cleaning I always eroticized, the cooking I didn’t - I just did it. 

Now that I’m mostly “retired” from my regular job I’ve been trying to up the level of service.  My objective is to give her complete freedom and control. Laundry was pretty easy, although she still likes to do some. House cleaning the big shift was keeping a revolving list of tasks (in an app) and tackling them in a timely manner before she notices. I still find this erotic, interestingly, but she can just enjoy a clean house and not have to worry about that.  

A huge shift was actually stepping up in meal planning and doing all the grocery shopping. And cleaning up after meals. I always enjoyed cooking, that was easy, even if I was tired and sore I could motivate myself to get into the kitchen and prepare a nice meal for the family. But the mental effort to plan the meals seemed a bridge too far. And, everyone would chip in as a family after a meal to clean up. But now with my new role and time from being semi-retired I tell her I would prefer to be in charge of cleaning up, washing dishes. Etc. 

One thing I might recommend to people is try to get up 1hr before your wife, to set your mind into your role, and have the house ready for her when you wake her up with her coffee or breakfast.

You add to your taste how much soda you want to your shot in a glass and just drink it that way. It usually takes two/two and a half whiskey shot to finish off one coca-cola. It is simple, and easy and no nasty face at the taste.

If you want to escalate drinking you can cut your chosen drink with rakija (which comes in small glass) and while it can be hard to swallow cuz of the burn, it is hardly nasty to drink so much that I need a chaser. 

Or you can be OG legend and drink rakija and coffee as part of morning routine to wake you up like a real boss. 

Anyways, sorry for long post, but I just don't get the whole shot, than chaser, seems weird to me considering you can just mix it in the first place and enjoy your evening without making faces or having to sip chasers as you work through a shot.

First off I’ll never take walking, my health, or pain free days for granted ever again. Sciatica has changed my life in negative ways overall but there’s positive in everything. Hard times make for strong individuals. 

I’m a month out of my hemilaminectomy and I’m finally starting to get out of the weeds of post op pain. 

I’m sleeping on my side again. I haven’t done this in years…. I’m gaining strength in my leg. My calf no longer aches in main and my heel is feeling padded instead of like standing on a rock. 

I’m a police officer and can wear my vest and gear without shuttering as I put it on for a 12 hour day. I don’t dread going to work anymore. 

My kids are happy daddy can pick them up again and can wrestle in the yard. They were the sweetest and kindest boys during my recovery and their patience should be applauded. 

There’s hope out there. I’m a proponent that if there’s an issue you get it FIXED. I waited way too long to do this and now I have no regrets. If you’re in pain for an extended period of time GET the surgery. I had tried everything from chiropractors, injections, decompressions, and therapy but this truly fixed the issue.

I’ve been going to Barrie South GO a few times a month from Toronto and every time it’s the same: people just standing around in the sun, nothing nearby. Not even a vending machine (it’s broken). And it’s definitely not a space issue, the parking lot goes on forever.

The closest Tim Hortons is a 10-minute walk and even that one doesn’t have anywhere to sit.

It’s not just GO either. A lot of TTC stations outside the downtown core are the same. I’m not talking about Union or the PATH.

A Toronto-specific example: you know that weird empty space when you walk down from Front Street to the Union station entrance towards the PATH? If this were Istanbul (where I’m from) or most cities in Europe, there’d probably be a little café or a bakery. Something to make the space feel a bit more alive and less like a giant passing room for commuters. But here? Empty. Grey. Sterile (I don’t mean clean or germ free cuz well… lol).

And I’m aware that this is what capitalism does to public spaces. The goal isn’t to make places pleasant or human. It’s to move people as efficiently as possible from home to work and back again. No time to sit down. No reason to linger. Just park your car, catch your train, get moving. On top of that, Canada’s endless bylaws, policies, and liability reasons probably aren’t helping.

Metrolinx and TTC probably see “no coffee shop” as a feature, not a bug. Less mess, less maintenance, no one loitering. The whole system is designed around efficiency, not quality of life. The space is technically “public”, but it’s built to keep people moving, not to give anyone a reason to pause.

Anyway, just something I’ve been thinking about every time I stand around with 20 minutes to kill and nowhere to get a coffee. It feels like such a missed opportunity to take advantage of these places and make them more for the people. Curious if others feel the same or if this is a champagne problem.

TL;DR: Why are GO and TTC stations around Toronto so empty of anything human like a coffee shop or bakery? Feels like public spaces here are designed just to keep people moving, not to make waiting even a little bit pleasant. Probably capitalism. Probably bylaws. Either way, it feels like a missed opportunity.",24,1753197477.0,toRANTo,14,1.0,False

If you want some of the context of who this person was as a DM, and some of the names I mention here, I recommend reading that here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dndhorrorstories/comments/1liyjdw/we\_gave\_our\_friend\_a\_second\_chance\_to\_dm\_he/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndhorrorstories/comments/1liyjdw/we_gave_our_friend_a_second_chance_to_dm_he/)

Tl;dr: Our friend runs a D&D 5e campaign, it was bad, we let him run a second one, it was worse. Lots of railroading with a *dash* of SA mixed in.



I had said in that post that I wanted to talk about how Lonnie was as a player if people were interested, but it’s a horror story in its own right, so I can post about it if I want to quite frankly. Plus I did get one request so I owe it to that guy. Don’t worry, this one will not be as long as the first one.



* **Lonnie’s characters were** ***under*****optimized.** It’s not a bad thing to have *un*optimized characters. Imo, unless you’re only doing combat, your character *should* have a few things they suck at, it’s what makes characters interesting and the party balanced. This was not that. Lonnie simply would not use core features of his class, and never had an in-character or story reason for it. His druid? Wild shaped maybe once over 40+ sessions. His Twilight cleric? *Refused* to wear armor. Not “didn’t have” or “couldn’t afford”. Refused (we’ll come back to that). His monk? Wielded a *lance* for some reason. He made baffling character choices constantly, which just made him more useless in combat than he had to be. Outside of combat, it wasn’t much better.
* **His characters were kinda pricks.** Again, on paper, this is not a bad thing. You can have characters who are dicks! But in-game, they are still part of a unit, and out-of-game, D&D is collaborative. Your character should be able to function well with the party, even if they’re rude and/or mean-spirited. Lonnie often played characters who were distrustful and condescending. Remember Lonnie’s cleric? The one who *refused* to wear armor? This was Dino’s 3rd campaign, the one he was eventually kicked from, if you read the other post. Anyway, his cleric died like 4 or 5 sessions in (dice rolls didn't go our way in combat). We indebted ourselves to an archdruid to have him reincarnated. Ramen's paladin, who felt guilty about being unable to protect Lonnie, spent the little gold he carried to buy him a shield. Lonnie’s character berated him and remarked he didn’t need our pity or the shield. His characters would make deals and sneak around behind the party’s back, often doing things that would affect the party as a whole. In my campaign, I very easily convinced his monk to take out a massive loan with a shady gang to buy a house that the party never even used, because he never told them about it. It coincidentally worked out with his backstory though; it was the first, and so far only time I have sent a PC’s adoptive mother after them to break their kneecaps.
* **A one-off but still noteworthy.** In my campaign, Lonnie switched subclasses without telling me. We were only a few sessions in and had only done, like, 2 combats, so I let it slide, but I really shouldn’t have.
* **He fudged dice rolls.** This was something I forgot to mention in the other post. He did this as a DM too, which is common, but it was always to our disadvantage. He would roll for a monster to hit, ask us our AC, then say they rolled 1 above that, or rolled that number on the die. It wasn’t all the time, but enough to be noticeable. As a DM, it’s hard to prove he was doing it. As a player? Well… When I ran my first campaign, I did a one-on-one Session 0 with each player, to introduce them to the world and some NPCs, etc etc. Lonnie and I did ours in person. We played in a little lounge in one of our college dorms, sitting across from each other at a coffee table. I asked Lonnie to roll something, I don’t even remember what, I think it was an ability check. This wasn’t a save-or-die thing, it was a session 0 after all. He rolls, the die lands on the table, it stops. Nat 1. Oof, that sucks. Before I can even begin to describe what happens, Lonnie snatches the die from the table, rolls it in his fingers, and says “11”. I looked him dead in the face and asked him if he was sure. He nodded. I wish I had been more confrontational back then, but I figured because the roll ultimately didn’t matter and I had never seen him do something like this, I’d let it slide and just watch out for the next one. 
* **In addition,** his cleric in Dino’s campaign started out with 2 more HP than what was mathematically possible at our level without any feats or items. When we pointed it out, he corrected it without making a fuss. We gave him the benefit of the doubt at the time because addition magically becomes harder when D&D is involved, but with hindsight, we’re not sure it was accidental. 

Whenever we look back on it, we realize we let him get away with a lot, but he *was* our friend, and D&D was overall fun with him (when he wasn't DMing). And as a silver lining, we at least know some red flags ahead of time... ",1,1753197346.0,dndhorrorstories,0,0.6,False

Two years ago, I was living what I thought was the perfect life. Corporate job, apartment in the city, a best friend I'd known since college who I thought would be there forever. Then came the numbness in my hands during a big presentation. Then the fatigue that no amount of coffee could fix. Then the morning I woke up and couldn't see clearly out of my left eye.

MS. Relapsing-remitting. The neurologist said it like she was ordering coffee.

I called my best friend first. You know what she said? ""Well, at least it's not cancer."" Then she asked if I was still coming to her birthday party that weekend because she'd already ordered the cake.

That was the moment I realized I'd been holding onto someone who saw me as a convenience, not a person.

**The Plot Twist Nobody Saw Coming**

My parents live 3,000 miles away. I'd been the ""independent one"" who never asked for help, never caused drama. Telling them felt impossible. What if they thought I was broken? What if they blamed my lifestyle? What if my dad made one of his ""helpful"" comments about how I should have taken better care of myself?

So I didn't tell them. For eight months.

Instead, I told my 75-year-old neighbor, Mrs. Chen, when she found me crying in the hallway after a particularly brutal flare. This woman who barely spoke English took one look at me and said, ""You come eat dinner. We talk.""

She became my first real support system. Then came my coworker who noticed I was struggling and offered to drive me to appointments. Then my cousin who I hadn't talked to in years but who reached out randomly and somehow became my MS buddy.

**The Family Reveal**

When I finally told my parents, you know what happened? My mom cried. Not because she was disappointed, but because I'd been dealing with this alone. My dad—the man I was terrified would lecture me—researched MS for three days straight and called me with a list of supplements and a plan to visit.

""Why didn't you tell us sooner?"" they asked.

Because I thought they were like my ex-best friend. Turns out, I'd been carrying around fear about people who actually love me.

**Where I Am Now**

That fake friend? Gone. Good riddance.

My real support network? Stronger than ever. I've got my family, my chosen family, and now I'm connected with people through platforms like MS Twins who actually get what it's like to wake up not knowing if today's a ""good brain day"" or if you'll need to cancel plans because your legs decided to take a vacation.

**The Point of This Novel**

If you're sitting there thinking you have to handle this alone—you don't. If you're afraid the people who matter will see you differently—maybe some will, but those aren't your people anyway. And if you're wondering whether it's worth finding others who truly understand this weird, unpredictable life we're living—it absolutely is.

MS didn't ruin my life. It just showed me which parts of my life were actually worth keeping.

To everyone reading this: you're not a burden. You're not broken. You're not alone. And if anyone in your life makes you feel like you are, they're showing you who they really are. Believe them, and find your real people.

He graduated last year and he’s been in the guest bedroom for 10 months saying he works remote as a “data engineer” but I’ve never seen a paycheck, never seen him talk to a boss, and all he does is sit at his computer all day talking to himself it seems or maybe other people over the computer. He’s mentioned things about crypto, and orders, but why would he have to use crypto to buy things if he had a real job?

He keeps getting packages. Boxes with computers and strange machines, even drugs.

I’ve heard him talk to his computer about things like “faster routes to Tokyo” or the order book and he’s always leaving the house late at night even when I tell him that it’s not smart to be out alone. He says he goes to coffee shops and he brings his laptop. He bought it so I don’t have the password. I think he’s might be selling drugs though or maybe meeting people to launder money.

He told me it’s all normal, but I caught him saying things about computers being aware and learning and “becoming more stable.”

I have no idea what that means, but it doesn’t sound like a job to me. I don’t want to overreact, but I’m scared. He doesn’t have friends over, barely eats dinner with me, and the door is always closed. He never socialized.

Dry Ingredients:
1/4 cup (30g) King Arthur Keto Wheat Baking Flour
1 scoop (30-35g total) Protein Powder:
1/2 scoop (15g) Vanilla Casein Protein
1/2 scoop (15g) Chocolate Whey Protein (or use all Vanilla Casein for a pure vanilla base)
1 tbsp (8g) Zero Sugar Cheesecake Pudding Mix
3 tbsp Granulated Monk Fruit Sweetener (or to taste)
1 tsp Vital Wheat Gluten
1/2 tsp Baking Powder
1/4 tsp Guar Gum
1/4 tsp Baking Soda
1 pinch Salt

Wet Ingredients:
1/4 cup (60g) Nonfat Greek Yogurt
1/4 cup (60g) Liquid Egg Whites
1/4 cup (60ml) Unsweetened Almond Milk
1 tsp Vanilla Extract

Instructions:
Preheat & Prep: Preheat your oven to 350 
Lightly spray your donut pan with non-stick cooking spray.

Combine Dry Ingredients: 
In a medium bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients (Keto flour, protein powders, pudding mix, sweetener, vital wheat gluten, baking powder, guar gum, baking soda, and salt).

Combine Wet Ingredients:
In a separate small bowl, whisk together the Greek yogurt, egg whites, almond milk, and vanilla extract until smooth.

Make the Batter: 
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Gently fold them together with a spatula until just combined. Do not overmix!The batter is thick.

Fill the Donut Pan: 
I spooned the batter into the donut pan, spreading it smooth. Tried to fill about 3/4 full. 

Bake: 
Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a donut comes out clean.

Cool: Let the donuts cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes before carefully inverting them onto a wire rack to cool completely. Do not frost them while they are still warm.

Chocolate glaze : 
2 tbsp 100% Cocoa Powder
2 tbsp Sugar-Free Maple Syrup
1 tbsp Granulated Monk Fruit Sweetener
1/2 tablespoon alulose syrup 
A tiny pinch of salt
A half teaspoon powdered coffee 
Whisk together until a smooth, thick glaze forms then dip the donuts in it and drizzle any additional on top

1m6go8b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m6go8b,🤪It almost became a low coffee table on wheels… but then turned into this! 🔥🛠️,"**😱😇Someone had put this gorgeous, huge board out on the street…**  
Did I take it? **OF COURSE I DID!** 😄

At first, I wanted to turn it into a low coffee table on wheels … so … **I GAVE IT WHEELS!! 💪**✨  
I was almost finished when suddenly those chrome parts I had stored in the basement popped into my head.

**TADAAAA!! 💡 A new idea was born**!  
Instead of a coffee table, I added the chrome parts, threw in a few driftwood boards, and… it transformed into a **LOFT / INDUSTRIAL WARDROBE** – straight out of my imagination and built by hand. 🔥🛠️✨

One moment I might be feeling productive, and the next, I’m completely nailed down. It's like my limbs turn into cinder blocks, and my eyelids just become so heavy that I can barely keep them open. 

I’m currently on 200mg of modafinil, and I also try drinking coffee or energy drinks to combat the fatigue. Sometimes, I even pop a Zyn for that little nicotine buzz. Yet, despite all that, I still feel like I could fall asleep at any moment. It’s so frustrating! 

I did sleep testing and thankfully didn't need an apnea mask, but it still doesn’t explain why I feel this way. Since October, I’ve lost nearly 70lbs, and despite the positive change, my energy levels haven’t improved at all. The fatigue from this disorder can be really depressing at times and makes me feel so defeated, and it feels like a never-ending cycle.

1m6gk9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1m6gk9v/dietary_advice_for_those_who_have_not_found_a/,Dietary advice for those who have not found a medication for insomnia,"I’ve been an insomniac/DSPD sufferer for 14 years. I was denied sleep medication and still am to this day. This post is for people who either cannot get the medication they need, or haven’t found the right one. 

Diet plays a huge role in all health. The same goes for people with sleeping issues. Your digestive system regulates sleep, emotion, hormones and energy. I found that if I couldn’t sleep properly, having a very regimented diet really kept my energy and wellbeing up when sleep could not. 

The main thing is sticking to very strict meal times. Whatever that is for you, make sure you are giving your body predictable and regular nutrition. Here’s my format:

**Breakfast - 7:30-8AM. 

Always have fibre in the morning/when you wake up. It energises your system and gets everything in motion. 
I tend to have granola, fruit, and yogurt with fruit juice/probiotic drink/ginger and turmeric shot. This is fibre, sugar, and good gut bacteria all in one. Whatever wakes you up is a good thing even if that’s chocolate cereal. Go for dark chocolate if you can, though. 

Between 8-9AM I have a coffee. Anything the gives you a boost is a good choice. 

Lunch - 12:30-1PM. 

This is the time to pack in nutrients and protein. Refuel your body midday and it comes back like karma. 
Generally this is meat, veg, and pasta/rice for me but any mixture of protein and veg/salad will do. Nuts would be a great choice here if I wasn’t allergic. 
I usually down a sugary fizzy drink for lunch, too. I’m not claiming to be a health guru, just explaining what gets me through the day. 

Dinner - 6-7PM. 

Again, not a health guru. I eat my sleepy foods for dinner, which tend to be carbs. Potato, cheese, fatty meats. Whatever winds your body down is the food you eat here. I also avoid sugar and caffeine after lunch, so wouldn’t recommend desserts.**

Don’t forget to drink water throughout the day, either. Get rid of the toxins your body can’t when you sleep. 

I really hope this helps someone out there. It took me about 6 months to figure out what woke me up, kept me awake and helped me at least feel sleepy in the evenings. It will take time for you to figure it out too but it’s worth it. I didn’t feel like a zombie after I adopted this since I just accepted I wouldn’t be sleeping. It has the benefit of making you healthier too even if you just stodge yourself at dinner. 

If you have any questions, I’ll do my best to answer them.

We both have been table partners for 2 years now, but suddenly she like pulled away and shit. Like I even texted her multiple times what's wrong and she j said nth nth. For context, my dad used to make me stay until 12 or 1 to study, and ingesting coffee gives me panic attacks so I used to sleep a lot during school. Because of this, I called another friend of mine at night to keep me awake and studying. But this best friend of mine thinks that I purposely sleep in class and she disliked me for staying up. She didnt know abt my dad btw. Then another thing is me making her uncomfortable. Small small stuff like rhis and she pulls away without any explanation. I might be wrong on some occasions, but I feel that it was wrong forbher to not have communicate her frustrations.

Sure thing,"My manager sent a passive-aggressive message to the whole team, clearly aimed at me: “Lunch breaks are unpaid, but everyone is expected to be available during core hours, including lunch”.

I used to take a quick walk or step out to grab coffee, never missed meetings, never late. But fine. If she wants me “available”, I’ll play along.

I started eating lunch at my desk every day - no headphones, not working. Just… sitting. I ignored emails and messages, and when people came over, I’d smile and say, “I’m on my unpaid break, but I’ll jump on it at 1”.

One day she sent a message at 12:10 asking for a report ASAP. I didn’t reply until 1:00. Someone else had scrambled to do it by then.

She later asked why I didn’t respond, and I said, “I was available, just not working. As instructed”.

1m6gffb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BisonGear/comments/1m6gffb/bison_gear_summer_sale/,🔥 BISON GEAR SUMMER SALE! 🔥,"Up to **25% off** our bestsellers: roof racks, MOLLE panels, cargo baskets, side steps, and other gear that actually makes a difference on the trail.  
This isn’t your average “beach towel and inflatable flamingo” summer sale. These are serious discounts on serious gear – built for the road, the woods, the adventure. 

**What’s on sale?**  
Honestly, it’s easier to list what’s not. But here’s a few highlights: 

 

🛠 **OX PRO Roof Racks**  
Tough, low-profile, modular – and built to handle whatever you throw at them. These aren't just racks; they’re full-on utility platforms for tents, shovels, gear, fuel cans and more.  
Lightweight, perfectly fitted to your rig – whether it's a Toyota, Lexus, Ford, or another overland beast.  
And yep – fully compatible with the OX PRO system. 

 

🍽 **OX PRO Under Roof Rack Camping Table Kit**  
A fold-out table that hides under your roof rack – quiet, secure, always ready.  
Pull it out when it’s time for coffee with a view, or dinner in the middle of nowhere.  
No rattling, no DIY nonsense. Just clean functionality. 

 

🧱 **OX PRO MOLLE Panels – internal & external**  
Turn dead space into useful space. Mount tools, bags, recovery gear – whatever you need at hand.

Add in organizers, pockets, easy mounting – and suddenly your cabin works as hard as your rack. 

 

🚪 **Door Table – tailgate-mounted fold-down table**  
Everyone has a tailgate. Not everyone uses it right.

But only on **Bison Gear products**.

1m6gfd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/allenai/comments/1m6gfd6/new_paper_alert_contextualized_evaluations/,"New paper alert ⚠️ ""Contextualized Evaluations: Judging Language Model Responses to Underspecified Queries""","In our new paper, “Contextualized Evaluations: Judging Language Model Responses to Underspecified Queries,” we find that adding just a bit of missing context can **reorder model leaderboards**—and **surface hidden biases**. ⚠️

An LLM prompt like “Is coffee good for you?” feels simple, but a helpful answer depends on *who’s asking* (e.g., someone who’s pregnant versus a person with high blood pressure). Most benchmarks **leave that context out.**

When evaluators get these “underspecified” prompts, they have to guess the backstory. The result? **Unstable rankings and shaky conclusions** about model quality.

We analyzed 3,580 queries randomly sampled from popular language model benchmarks, including Chatbot Arena. We found that **underspecification is widely prevalent**—the vast majority of queries are open-ended (76%). Many are also subjective (19%) or incomplete (18%).

Our fix: *contextualized evaluation*. Supplying the missing info…

1️⃣ Boosts evaluator agreement

2️⃣ Sometimes completely flips which model “wins”

3️⃣ Leads to more judgments based on content, not style

4️⃣ Exposes biases in default model responses.

For example, we found that default model answers **often align better with users from Western, higher‑income backgrounds**—an equity gap that context‑free testing missed.

The takeaway? Evaluations **need context** to reflect real‑world use and to ensure models serve *all* users.

1m6geqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m6geqy/th_lawful_bond_between_father_and_son/,[TH] Lawful bond between Father and Son,"The morning news blared from the tiny kitchen radio, the kind of static-laced report that seeped into your bones. ""Breaking news out of Philadelphia,"" the voice announced, grim and urgent. ""Authorities have apprehended a man in connection with the homicide of prominent business executive, Arthur Jenkins. Sources close to the investigation confirm the suspect was an employee at Mr. Jenkins' firm, Sterling & Finch. More details on this developing story as they emerge.""  
  
He sat slumped at his kitchen table, the taste of stale coffee bitter on his tongue. The exhaustion was a physical weight, pressing down on him, a constant hum behind his eyes. He remembered the cafe that morning, a fleeting attempt at a peaceful start. A moment of clumsiness, a splash, and the dark stain blossomed across his crisp white shirt—a blot on an already tarnished day. His face had burned with a furious heat, and a guttural, strangled cry had escaped him, startling the barista. It was just a shirt, he knew, but it felt like the universe's final, mocking jest.  
  
For weeks, the older man had been a relentless tormentor. ""Late again, are we?"" he'd sneer, his eyes, cold and sharp, raking over him with thinly veiled contempt. ""And what's this? Did you lose a fight with your breakfast?"" The boss's voice, a grating sandpaper on his already frayed nerves, always found a way to mock, to belittle, to chip away at the last vestiges of his self-respect. He would clench his fists, the fury a hot, churning wave in his gut, but he'd always swallowed it down. Until today.  
  
That afternoon, his boss had sauntered over, a smirk playing on his lips, and pointed a manicured finger at the coffee stain. ""Still wearing that, Callahan? Really exemplifies your commitment to… cleanliness, doesn't it?"" Before he could even form a retort, the boss leaned down and, with a casual flick of his wrist, powered off his computer. The sudden silence in the office was deafening. The screen went black, and with it, something inside the man snapped.  
  
A primal roar tore from his throat as he lunged from his chair. He slammed into his boss, sending the man sprawling to the ground. In a blur of motion, he was on top of him, hands closing around the boss's throat with an instinctual, terrifying grip. Saliva flecked his lips, his eyes, bloodshot from weeks of sleepless nights, burned with an unholy fire. Each gasping struggle from the boss fueled a deeper, darker rage within him. Time seemed to dissolve, until finally, the body went slack. The silence returned, this time absolute, chilling. He could only stare at the lifeless form, the enormity of his actions slowly, horrifically, dawning on him. The distant wail of sirens was the only sound that pierced the suffocating stillness.  
  
The fluorescent lights of the courtroom seemed to amplify his every tremor. Sweat plastered his shirt to his skin, a cold, clammy film. The air was thick with expectation, each hushed whisper a judgment. He knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that his future hinged on a good lawyer. And he knew just the man. A tough pill to swallow, perhaps, given their fractured past, but his son was the only name that came to mind.  
  
Confined to a sterile holding room before the trial, his hand trembled as he clutched his phone. He bit the bullet, and dialed.  
  
Miles away, the younger man stared at his ringing phone, his heart sinking with each vibration. Why now? he asked himself, the question a bitter taste in his mouth. He hesitated, then, with a sigh, picked up.  
  
""Hello,"" his father’s voice, firm but laced with an unfamiliar tremor, came through the receiver.  
  
""What do you want, old man?"" The son’s voice was as cold and sharp as a winter wind.  
  
""I'll cut the crap, son. I'm about to stand trial.""  
  
""And why should I care?"" His tone remained glacial.  
  
""Look, I'm deep in it, son. Deeper than you can imagine. And I'll fall even further without a lawyer. Please. Just this once. Help me.""  
  
The younger man’s hesitation was palpable. The memories of his father – the shouts, the beatings, the dismissive glares – flashed through his mind. ""What are you accused of?"" he asked, the words forced from his lips.  
  
His father sighed, a harsh, ragged sound. There was no escape. ""Murder.""  
  
The younger man’s breath hitched. The phone slipped from his grasp, clattering to the floor. He stared blankly at the wall, a deadness in his eyes, before slowly, mechanically, turning to his laptop, as if answering emails could erase the existence of his father.  
  
Later that day, exhaustion finally claimed him. He decided to take a nap. As he entered his bed, a storm of thoughts raged within him: Was he wrong about his father? Should he help him? His skin started to sweat aggressively. He shook the thoughts off as he slowly fell asleep. He was suddenly in a dark room. He wasn't scared, just confused. He peacefully stood there for some moments, before a white door opened in front of his eyes. He somehow knew that was the door to go through. He even started to walk toward it, but suddenly he stopped. He stood there for some solid moments, before the door suddenly closed. He closed his eyes then started screaming.  
  
""Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!"" he exclaimed, jolting awake.  
  
He calmed down, acknowledging it was just a dream, and went to make coffee.  
  
While slowly drinking from his coffee, his father called again. He almost didn't respond, but an unnatural force made him pick up the phone.  
  
""Hey, son, look, I'm sorry. I know how I treated you as a kid—shouting at you, beating you and your mother, never looking at you like a real person. I know these things really hurt you and shaped you into who you are today. I'm sorry, I wish you had a better dad.""  
  
The younger man stayed silent, a tear tracing a path down his cheek. ""Dad, I will be your law—""  
  
""I'm sorry…"" His father said, sounding on the verge of sobs.  
  
""No need, Dad. I will be your lawyer.""  
  
""Unfortunately not, son. I'm making this call from my jail cell, and I'm gonna be here until my eyes never open again.""  
  
The younger man’s eyes widened, his breath caught in his throat. The dark room of his dream flashed before his eyes, the white door, now impossibly shut. He dropped the phone, and started to sob uncontrollably, the dream's meaning now piercing him with brutal clarity. He tried to articulate a sentence, but a man's voice was heard saying the time had passed.  
  
""Beep! Beep! Beep!"" The phone rang its disconnect tone.  
  
He fell to the floor and stared at the ceiling. The floor is where he remained for two and a half days before dying from dehydration.

**Across the Street**

Beth liked her quiet mornings. The soft hum of the kettle, the weight of her medical textbooks in her lap, the way the sunlight filtered through her curtains just right—it was her ritual. A moment of peace before the chaos of lectures and hospital rotations.  

Then *he* moved in.

She noticed him on the third day, carrying a box into the house across the street. Tall, dark-haired, moving with the kind of quiet efficiency that suggested he’d done this before. Alone. No movers, no friends, just him.  

Something about him was familiar.  

Beth frowned, sipping her tea. Had she seen him somewhere? Campus, maybe? No, that wasn’t it. She had a good memory for faces, and his —sharp jaw, tired eyes— stuck with her. But she couldn’t place it.  


He didn’t make noise. That was the first thing Beth realized. Most new neighbors had parties, or at least loud conversations, but his presence was almost ghostly. The only sign of life was the soft glow of his living room lamp late at night and the occasional scent of coffee drifting from his open window.  

Then, one rainy afternoon, she saw him standing under the awning of a small café just a few blocks away. *His* café, she realized, reading the sign: **Hollow Grounds**.  

Of course. The quiet weirdo who worked at a coffee shop. That explained the smell.

Their eyes met through the drizzle. He offered a small smile—polite, automatic. The kind that didn’t quite reach his eyes.

Beth nodded back.

And just like that, the moment passed.

Government Fails...,"July 21, Monday unang pasok for the week kaya onsite ako! Maayos naman ang panahon pagalis ko. Makulimlim pero ganun naman lately so deadma. Who would have thought na later that day i'll be stranded in the car for 12 freaking hours?

4 PM ang end of shift ko. Pag labas ko sa office napakalakas ng ulan. EDSA sobrang traffic halos 1 hr from Cubao to SM North kaya nag desisyon akong mag turn right sa Congressional and left sa Mindanao going to NLEX. No signs of apocalypse yet so gora lang. Bad decision pala. May construction sa may tollgate palabas ng Mindanao Ave so ung mga sasakyan they all have to make a u turn pero flooded na pala ung u turn slot! Panick mode ako sa loob ng kotse.  Mas mataas na sa gutter ung baha! Pano pag mas tumaas pa? Pano pag na trapped ako dun? Deadma sa baha I keep honking para gumalaw ung mga sasakyan sa unahan ko. I keep changing lanes and i stepped on the gas para makaliko sa u turn and makaalis sa baha. Thankful na walang ""check engine lights"". Na survived naman ang malalim na baha. 

Akala ko un na ang worst part. Nope. Pagdating ko malapit sa exit pa NLEX I see red tail lights everywhere. Walang galawan ang traffic hindi ako maka exit so no choice I had to go straight to Mindanao Ave Extension and hoped for a miracle. Nag stop and park ako sa first emergency bay na nakita ko around 6pm. By 7...8...9..10pm..11pm.. I was still there stuck. May dala akong laptop, my cellphone, water, I have clothes in the car and thats it. No food! my last meal that day was during lunch around 11am pa. Hindi ko naman alam na magfafasting pala ako that day! 

While waiting for the baha to go away, I used my phone to check for updates online and to also update close friends and family. The work laptop nag turn on din ako to check new emails and new surveys and muntik na din ako mag reply sa mga emails ng customers kahit outside working hours ko na. Wala kasing ibang magawa. No way out eh. I couldnt see the end of the traffic anymore. Gustuhin ko man bumalik sa QC kahit pa sa Balintawak baha din daw and wala naman u turn dun and kahit meron wala na din galawan ung mga sasakyan sa other side. I also dont want to go back to Mindanao Ave just to drive in a flood again. NLEX no go walang makadaan sa Paso De Blas kasi baha! Hindi na ako nag attempt sa Mcarthur sa NLEX nga baha mas baha dun for sure! Best option stay put and wait.

Ang update status ako sa family, I assured them that I'm ok but deep inside in scared. Im a woman alone In the car na nakapark sa expressway sa gabi hangang madaling araw bukod sa baha may real safety concerns. Light sleep lang, locked doors and tiny windows opening for air. Feeling ko para akong nasa horror movie. 

Past 12 midnight nag announce na passable na daw sa NLEX so around 1am nag desisyon na ako magdrive para makauwi na. Since andun ako sa side pa South bound no choice drive lang hangang makahanap ng exit para makabalik sa north bound. Nag exit sa Caloocan - boom baha naman! Panick mode ulet but still presence of mind the goal is go back to an elevated highway para sure na walang baha so forda hanap ng entry sa skyway.

Sa may Quezon avenue may nakita akong entry to skyway, but pa south bound pala un! Wala din u turn sa skyway so again I had to drive south to exit somewhere para mag u turn and umakyat ulet pa balik sa north. Ang Waze and Google maps at this point walang silbi! Pinapapunta ako sa kalsada na baha gusto yata akong lunurin ng AI. 

Around 2am nakabalik din ako sa NLEX. Traffic pa din! Pero gow lakasan na lang ng loob bahala na goal is makauwi kahit pa pagod na, antok na, gutom na and sobrang naiihi na. Hindi kasi ako lumabas ng sasakyan ever. Wala naman kasing cr sa emergency bay. Hindi pwedeng squat outside the car i was thinking about of my safety and baka may makakita baka mag viral pa ako! Last bathroom break ko was 4pm after my shift. So ilang oras na ba ako nagpipigil nyan sana lang hindi ako magkasakit neto. From the Balintawak toll plaza it took more than 1 hr pa before reaching the nearest safest and the only gas station na nadadaan ko sa NLEX - KM23. Favorite stop ko ito for take outs and quick coffee so I know exactly where to find the cr. Around 3am nakarating din sa KM23 pero hindi ko na kinakaya nag pee na ako on the side as in paglabas na paglabas ng car tulo na hahaha. Sana lang walang nakakita sakin. Buti na lang naka dress ako and I have emergency clothes in the car. 

Pagdating ko sa subdivision around 4am may baha na sa kalsada near the house so for the car's safety I had to park somewhere na mas mataas. Outside ng gate 2 ako nagpark and its about 10 mins walk away from home. Tired of all the ganap for that day so bagsak ako sa bed as soon as I reached home.

Pero wait hindi pa tapos. Had to wake up at 8 because may appointment si mama sa Ortigas. Guess who is the designated driver? Yeah ako po! Pauwi na kami ulet sa Bulacan when napansin namin na nawawala and plate number sa harap ng car. Kulang pa ata ang misfortune ko today! So deretso sa Barangay nag report ng possible intentionally stealing the plate number while parked outside the subdivision. Pwede din nawala during the drive sa baha sa Mindanao Ave. Ay ewan hassle naman nag pa affidavit of loss pa and nag police report. Next step sa LTO.  

Ang tanong ko lang, saan kaya napunta ang tax natin? And laki ng kaltas every cut off pero hindi ko ramdam hindi naman ako nabibigyan ng ayuda! Bakit po baha everywhere? Nasan na po ang bilyong pisong flood control projects? Ang mga government offices kung maka demand ng mga requirements para sa lost plate wagas parang gustong nyo talagang pahirapan ang citizens instead na mapadali ang life. Proud ako maging citizen sa Pilipinas pero hindi ako proud sa systema na ganito. Deserve po namin ng mas maayos na public service, ung hindi malulunod sa baha, sa stress at sa kabobohan ng systema.

I’ve just created a WhatsApp group specifically for lesbian and bisexual women who are either working in mental health or have a genuine interest in the field – and who are based in or around London, UK.

The aim is to connect, share experiences, and maybe even meet up in person for chats, walks, coffee, or events. It would be so lovely to build a supportive little community of like-minded women who understand each other both personally and professionally.

I thought I'd share a couple non-cost, easy ways I help myself get set to study. I hope these ideas support your own ideas and give you a little boost today that this is possible.

* I use the same coffee cup during study time. It's a mental signal that it's study time
* Write your tests where you study (if possible). Location is part of memory (including the background sounds and the smells)
* I have a candle with the wooden wick going when I write research papers. The flicker sound and the routine both signal ""writing time"". The wood burning for me is a very comforting pleasing sound.
* I have a shelf with some little bits of memorabilia that are very happy memories for me. When I look away from my book, screen, desk - that little shelf is sometimes a very soft landing place for me brain.
* I keep my study space cool, often wear shorts and a t, it doesn't have a lot of cozy comfort elements. This is intentional. Study time is for studying. Comfy cozy time is not study time.

First and foremost, I hope everyone who clicks on this request thread is having a fantastic day! If you’re taking the time to read this, I appreciate it! Hopefully, you will find something that you like in this request. If not, I wish you the best of luck with your future writing endeavors.

About Me:

You can call me T! I go by He/Him pronouns. I’m in my late thirties and am in the EST Time Zone. If there’s anything you want to know specifically, let me know! I’m more than happy to answer any questions.

My Writing Style:

I write in novella/semi-novella style in the third person past tense. The length of my writing can depend on what my partner gives me back. I don’t like to write massive posts because I think that a good back-and-forth with roleplaying is needed. Generally speaking, you’ll get anywhere between two hundred to four hundred words from me.  Unless I’m setting up something or writing out an action scene. That being said, I like details a lot. I like to paint a picture and “set the scene” so to speak.

I also am a NSFW writer. All of my stories feature adult content. I don’t do fade to black. All posts should be marked accordingly but just to make sure there’s no confusion that’s a significant part of what I’m looking for.

What I Need From A Partner:

Third-person past tense is a MUST with me. I’m also looking for writers who write more than one sentence. If you can match me great! If not, then at least be willing to provide details and “set the scene” with me.

Writing Platforms: 

I write mainly on Discord. I don’t write on Reddit all that often. I’m not opposed to writing on Reddit per say, but I mainly use this platform to find writing partners. That means I have a lot of back and forth messages and rps in chat have gotten lost in the shuffle. So be aware of that when reaching out to me. 

Availability:

My availability is all over the place right now. I have a full-time job, a family, and a side hustle. So, sometimes, I can reply multiple times a week, and sometimes, I can only reply once a week. It really depends on how my schedule shakes out. If you’re the type of person who needs replies everyday I’m not your partner. However, if you can be patient with me, I promise to be patient with you and bring my A-Game when I do reply.

Hello all! Today I’m interested in a collection of fandom ideas. Please note, this will involve Canon X Canon couples. 

What I’m interested in is superhero meet cutes, then SoL dating a superhero shenanigans. I have a collection of DC and Marvel ideas that involve this concept. My primary desire is for romantic stories where our Superhero meets their romantic pairing and they start dating. 

Most of these pairings aren’t SuperheroxSuperhero, but some of them are. For those, it would be more a focus on them dating then on the adventures and what not. That being said, here are the pairings and ideas I’m interested in:

Barry/Iris: Barry is working as a CSI in Central City while also being The Flash (as per the norm). Iris is working as a news reporter for Central City and is down there trying to interview the police. Barry sees Iris and is so smitten with her he goes up to chat with her.Theirs chemistry between the two and Barry invites Iris out for coffee. Things progress from there as the two start dating. 

Reed/Sue: Reed is approached by Sue’s Dad to come work at the Baxter Building after Reed is kicked out by the US Government. Reed is trying to build a rocket to go to space and the Baxter Building is all about space travel and trying to explore the stars. As he comes to work at the Baxter Building, he meets Sue and falls hopelessly in love with her. (Note: I wouldn’t be against an age gap relationship for this one). 

Clark/Lois: Clark has just started working at the Daily Planet. About a year ago, he officially started as Superman. As he settles into his new job he meets the charismatic Lois Lane and starts to court her. 

Bruce/Selina: The bat and the cat meeting in costume or not. They could meet while Selina is trying to steal something or they can meet at some sort of societal event. After that initial meeting, the two of them would start dating or something along those lines. The other idea is we can skip around as their relationship grows and strengthens. 

Peter/Mary Jane: Peter and Mary Jane have never met, Peter is Spider-Man and Mary Jane is a popular broadway actress. Peter is tasked by the Daily Bugle to go along on an interview and take photos of Mary Jane. The two meet and as in all of these cashews the sparks fly. Peter asks Mary Jane out and we go from there. 

Oliver/Dinah: During a Justice League meeting at the Watchtower, the two meet for the first time. Oliver asks Dinah out after the meeting and things progress from there. 

Richard/Kori: Grayson is at a club when he sees Kori dancing. Intrigued and smitten by the orange skinned alien, he goes over and starts dancing with her. This leads to one night stand and then the two start dating from there. 

Kara/Brainiac Five: Kara is off Earth enjoying herself on a red sun planet. Whilst on vacation, she meets Brainiac Five. The two of them have a drunken one night stand and then that leads to more as Kara continues to enjoy her vacation. 

Vision/Wanda: Sometime after an Avenger event, Vision finally works up the courage to ask Wanda out properly. She says yes and the two start spending more and more time together after missions. 

Remy/Rogue: The minute Remy sees Rogue its all over. Instantly smitten with the southern Belle, Remy makes it his mission to win her heart. And even though Rogue knows what she could do to him, she’s drawn in all the same.

Hey everyone,

we are two girls (29, 32) from Germany heading to Ibiza from 25.-29.07. and would love your recommendations for clubs, beach clubs, fun activities, and unique experiences!

Trip Details:
Arrival: Friday, 25.07., arriving in the evening
Departure: Tuesday, 29.07.
Rental car available 
Hotel in Platja d’en Bossa

What we’ve planned so far:
Saturday: Old town, Las Dalias Market
Sunday: Boat trip to Formentera

Music & Party:
We’re looking for great parties with a fun vibe and danceable music, ideally a mix of authentic experiences and iconic venues.

Since it’s our first time on the island, we definitely want to experience at least one of the big-name clubs like Ushuaïa, Hï or Pacha.

We’re considering Black Coffee or David Guetta, but a bit unsure due to the crowds and high prices – still open to going for the experience!

Sadly we’ll miss HUGEL since he plays Thursdays at Hï.

What we’re looking for:
- Beach clubs with good music & atmosphere – perfect for drinks, dancing, or just chilling 
- Clubs/events with music where we can actually dance
- Active things to do like SUP, Pilates, Padel, hiking, etc.
- Nice beaches that are easily accessible by car 

We’re super excited for the trip and would really appreciate any tips 🫶🏻",1,1753195628.0,ibiza,1,1.0,False

In-Depth Review,"Testing out the Breville BES880BSS Barista Touch Espresso Machine has been a delightful journey into premium coffee-making at home. As someone who values high-quality espresso and enjoys experimenting with different coffee recipes, this machine brought a professional-level experience unlike any other I’ve tried before. From its sleek brushed stainless steel finish to its user-friendly features, this coffee maker is clearly designed for coffee enthusiasts who want both performance and convenience. 

**Elegant Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was how solid and sophisticated the espresso machine feels. Its modern style fits effortlessly into any kitchen aesthetic, dominating the countertop with an understated elegance. The compact dimensions of 12.7""D x 15.5""W x 16""H mean it doesn’t take up more space than necessary, though it’s not exactly lightweight, weighing in at 21.8 pounds. I appreciate that the machine strikes a great balance between being sturdy and manageable. Its brushed stainless steel finish makes it easy to clean, though it does attract fingerprints occasionally.

**Superb Operation with Touchscreen Control**  
The intuitive touchscreen was one of my favorite features. It allows you to follow a simple “Grind, Brew, Milk” progression, making the process straightforward even for beginners. As someone who loves customization, the ability to create and save up to 8 personalized coffee preferences is a game-changer. It was fun experimenting with different settings for coffee strength, milk temperature, and foam texture, and later saving my favorite combinations. My family also got a kick out of having their profiles saved for their lattes and cappuccinos.

**Precision in Espresso Extraction**  
Another standout feature is the digital temperature control (PID), which provides water at exactly the right temperature for optimal espresso extraction. During my tests, I consistently achieved rich and balanced flavor in every cup, no matter the bean or roast type used. Also, the low-pressure pre-infusion does an amazing job at gradually increasing pressure during extraction, ensuring all the flavors are evenly drawn out.

[Check Breville BES880BSS Barista Touch Espresso Machine price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b078wmlxxg/)

**The Grinder Adds Convenience**  
One of the highlights of this espresso machine is undoubtedly the integrated conical burr grinder. With a single tap, it delivers a precise dose of coffee, preserving maximum flavor. It made a noticeable difference compared to pre-ground coffee, and knowing I could grind fresh beans each time raised the overall quality of my brewing sessions. Adjusting the grind settings gave me enough control to suit different coffee styles, whether it was for an intense espresso shot or a lighter Americano.

**Key Benefits**  
- The ThermoJet heating system heats up in just 3 seconds, allowing minimal wait before making coffee.  
- Automated steam wand textures milk perfectly for latte art or frothy cappuccinos.  
- The 67 oz water tank and ½ lb bean hopper ensure fewer interruptions during busy mornings.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Some aspects could use a bit of tweaking, though.  
- The water tank, while spacious, isn’t the most convenient to remove and refill.  
- Despite the premium price point, no option for plumbed water is available, which would’ve been a nice touch.  
- The touchscreen, though a brilliant addition, can sometimes lag slightly when scrolling through settings.  

**Competitive Options**  
When comparing with other competitors like the De'Longhi La Specialista or the Gaggia Classic Pro, the Barista Touch stands out for its robust touchscreen interface. Both alternatives have their charm, though, especially if you’re seeking a more hands-on experience at a slightly lower price point. Gaggia’s product, for instance, offers a more traditional manual setup, while De’Longhi strikes a balance between automation and user involvement. However, Breville’s precise temperature control, fast heat-up system, and personalized coffee features give it an edge for those who like customization and efficiency.

**Worth Every Penny**  
In terms of value, this espresso machine provides top-tier features comparable to what you’d find in pricier commercial models. Though certainly not a budget-friendly option, its quality and versatility make it an investment for any coffee-lover serious about elevating their at-home brewing experience. The added convenience of programmable settings and its upscale design further justify its cost against similar machines.

We have the K-cup Keurig machine and some coffee bags from a local company for our drip machine (terrible). I really wanted a Breville Express Impress but I could not push the $800 cost through the budget and not willing to do the cleanup maintenance behind others. When I saw the Vertuo for $150, I figured I could make it work. However, I'm now realizing that the pods are different from the original in that the bar code determines how much water is pushed through and the amount of grounds inside. 

I'm trying to make this as simple as possible for people to get a good cup of coffee and maybe this will create interest in learning more about the machine or upgrading in the future. But to start off, what kind of pod do you suggest for simplicity? 5.07oz  Grand Lungo,  Fortado or something 7.77oz in Melozio. I just want to have hot coffee options without milk to start to keep people from being confused on what to do. I just want them to pick a pod and push a button. Am I on the right track?

I’d first say that even if I’m an outsider, I sought permission from your mods before posting here. 

I’m a queer Muslim woman living in Australia, whose family comes from Lebanon and who is sipping overpriced coffee and trying to make some space for queer friendships that feel unforced, nice, and maybe a little bit chaotic in a positive way.

I’ve met some really warm South Asian queers here, but I’ve always been curious about what the rhythm of queer life is like over there. Things are more layered, more restricted, but I’ve always felt that Pakistani queers carry so much grace, humour, and quiet strength in how they navigate it all. That’s something I genuinely respect.

I’d love to talk to other queer folks. Women especially, but really anyone kind and queer is welcome. I carry myself a little differently in life with some structure and intensity (the quiet sort that does not need constant explanation) but nothing overwhelming unless you count my snack opinions.

It can get lonely sometimes even with support. Sometimes you just want someone who understands the cultural soup and doesn’t flinch when you say something layered. Someone who knows what it means to be queer and soft and responsible and maybe a little feral all at once (and who finds that kind of balance normal).

So yes… feel free to say hi. Even if your social battery runs out in twenty minutes. Even if you’re still figuring things out. Especially if you know how to keep a secret from everyone within a 50 kilometre radius.

So ayun duon muna ako nag-stay. Di Naman first time na pumunta ako sa place niya pero mandalas kaming magkasama every week if Di Kami busy. To hang out in his place or to just go out for a coffee.

Until this past week nagsunod sunod mga problema KO so ayun Siya lagi na Lang niya akong tinutulungan ako Naman nag contribute with the groceries and doing the household chores.

I did some research before on how to position the Pro 2 (P2) in my living room but in practice it seems my throw distance 'calculations' are off.

**Context:**  
The room is around 6 meter in depth while the projected wall is \~2m in height and \~4m wide. Since this wall currently has my 65"" tv hanging, I'm projecting the other wall behind my couch as a test-setup. The walls and ceiling are powder painted (white) and plaster treated. The (final) idea is to mount the P2 on the ceiling above the couch, which is around 5.5m from the projected wall.   
  
The P2 has the latest fw and ultimately I want to acquire a proper screen to project on. The room itself is dark (enough). I'm sitting slightly behind the P2 in the test-setup. The majority of the settings is switched off or set low, e.g. sharpness (2).

**Experience:**  
I placed the P2 on the tv furniture which is more or less the same distance as my couch in the final setup but of course not the same height. What happened is that a large part of the wall was projected but also of the ceiling. I read that physical placement is key and adjusting the focus etc should be mitigated to have the best image. So I placed the P2 on a small portable coffee table and started to move it closer to the wall. Ultimately I ended up half way the room and zoomed out to cover the wall (above my couch) and not the ceiling. I noticed 'light' around the movie.

**Questions:**  
\- How should I treat the placement of the P2 in regards of my room: is the way how I moved the P2 across the room the proper approach or should I choose where I want the P2 to stand/hang and then adjust the picture settings?

\- In the projector settings you should select where the P2 is placed (in front of you or behind the screen). Why is there no option that the P2 is behind you (e.g. on a ceiling)?

**Other questions & experiences:**

\- When playing content, the subs are causing the picture to light up briefly until the subs are gone and it reverts back to a darker state (and repeat). This is **very** annoying and I saw a similar remark from u/maxinxin. Any idea how to mitigate this and how/why this effect exists? 

\- Every review touts EBL, but in my experience I really can't see any difference. How would one experience this? Are additional settings or specific content needed? 

\- A new phenomenon I learned was 'the rainbow effect'. It's very apparent with white subtitles, but also with candles or other light elements versus a dark background, e.g. a conversation held in a cave. Can this be mitigated by sitting in front of the P2? How to prevent/mitigate this effect?

i (26f) matched w/ this guy “Ben” (29m) on hinge like mid-june. tbh i wasn’t even trying to date seriously at the time, just swiping for fun, but he actually stood out. like he wasn’t corny or trying too hard, and he just seemed... idk, steady? normal? we talked pretty much every day. not just small talk either... like long convos abt life, random deep stuff at 1am, even childhood memories. he told me he hadn't dated in a while cuz he wanted to “do it right” this time, whatever that means.

we met in person a week after that. first date was super chill, coffee and a long walk. second date was dinner and drinks, and i thought it went even better. he opened up more, told me his mom passed away a few yrs ago and how it messed w/ his trust in ppl. i shared stuff too. we kissed after, and not to be cringe but it wasn’t just a casual kiss... it felt meaningful. even he said “this felt really good” after. the way he looked at me… idk, i thought we were maybe starting something slow but real.

the next morning he texted like normal, asked if i got home okay, then later in the day we were talking abt food and he said “next time we hang i’ll cook for you.” that was literally the last thing he ever said to me.

after that i texted him like “hey you good?” and it stayed on delivered for days. no reply. i didn’t spam him or anything, i just let it go but yeah, i felt lowkey stupid. it wasn’t even just the ghosting, it was that i let myself think he was one of the “safe” ones. the way he talked, the stuff he shared, idk it all just felt too real to fake.

fast fwd a week later, i’m out at this bar w/ my friends and guess who’s there... yep, Ben. on a date. and not even lowkey. like sitting across from some girl, holding her hand, full-on smiling and touching her hair like they’re together. i was literally frozen for a sec. we locked eyes, and i swear he panicked. turned back to his drink real quick.

i tried to play it cool but my friends saw everything and were like “girl what the hell.” i wasn’t even gonna say anything at first but i was already 2 drinks in and shaking a little so yeah, i walked up.

i didn’t scream or curse or anything, i just said, “wow, so that’s it? ghost me after all that and now you’re here pretending i don’t exist?” and i walked away. that’s literally all. the girl just stared at me, then at him, and Ben didn’t say anything at all. not a sorry, not a word.

my friends hyped me up and said i handled it well but a couple ppl (esp one guy friend) said i prob embarrassed myself, and made it look like i couldn’t take rejection. one even said “well he didn’t owe you anything, you weren’t exclusive.”

i mean, sure, we didn’t define anything, but he literally said he wanted to “build something real” and then just poofed? it’s not like i imagined everything. i wouldn’t have been that affected if it was just casual. i don’t normally react like this either. i think it’s just how sudden and cold it all was.

so yeah. AITA for saying something? or should i have just stayed quiet and moved on like a normal person?",8,1753194906.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,11,1.0,False

1m6fqm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1m6fqm5/how_does_the_bodum_pour_over_coffee_maker_elevate/,How Does the Bodum Pour Over Coffee Maker Elevate Your Morning Brew?,"Coffee lovers like me always have a quest—finding the perfect brew at home. Recently, I took the *Bodum 11592-01US* for a spin, and let me tell you, this particular coffee maker has been an intriguing experience. Designed as a pour-over coffee maker, it combines simplicity, elegance, and an environmentally-friendly touch. But hey, it’s not without some quirks either. Let’s dive into the details of my daily adventures testing this gadget.

**Sleek Design meets Functionality**

The moment I unpacked this coffee maker, its design stood out. Crafted from premium high-heat borosilicate glass, the material boasts a non-porous nature, something I genuinely appreciated after realizing it left zero aftertastes lingering from my test brews. The reusable stainless steel filter? That’s where sustainability shines through—no more fumbling with disposable paper filters, which sometimes end up trapping the very oils that define a rich coffee aroma.

Its black sleeve added a dash of modern aesthetic, though to be candid, the sleeve's minimal grip sometimes made it feel a tad slippery, particularly when handling it after brewing. If you’re someone clumsy like me, you might want to exercise a bit of caution.

**Effortless Brewing Experience**

What caught my attention was the manual brewing process. I enjoy the therapeutic vibe of pouring hot water into fine coffee grounds and taking control of every step. This pour-over maker emphasizes mindfulness, especially in mornings when I need a dose of calm before caffeine kicks in. The brewing process is straightforward—one reason I foresee it suiting both beginners and coffee aficionados. 

However, keep in mind your brew time might go past four or five minutes if you’re picky about getting that perfectly steeped flavor. With patience, though, the result is worth it. Also, the permanent filter uniformly extracts the richness from grounds, something I couldn’t help but marvel at with each cup.

**Perks**

- Crafted from high-quality borosilicate glass, ensuring no flavors are absorbed.  
- Reusable stainless steel filter enhances taste while eliminating waste.  
- The eco-friendly design avoids the reliance on paper or plastic consumables.  
- Portable and compact—great for kitchen counters or even road trips.  

[Ready to buy Bodum 11592-01US? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0d6xrlss8/)

**You’ll Need a Steady Hand**

On some days, I found myself slightly fumbling with pouring accuracy. Maybe I’m not the most graceful morning person, but the manual mode shows no mercy for shaky hands. Drips outside the filter occurred if I rushed too much. Those slips are minor hiccups for skilled users, but if patience (or coordination) isn’t your strength, you might want to choose something fuss-free.

**Shortcomings**

- The black sleeve grip isn’t always secure, especially with wet hands.  
- Takes longer than some coffee enthusiasts might like to brew.  
- Requires steady pouring accuracy, which might not suit beginners.  

**Peer Products in Comparison**

When lined up against similar pour-over options like the Chemex or Hario V60, the *Bodum 11592-01US* holds its ground impressively. While the Chemex relies heavily on paper filters (and let’s face it, an ongoing expense), this coffee maker’s reusable filter scores an edge in cost-effectiveness. The Hario V60, on the other hand, has precise control but demands more finesse, making it more suited to baristas-in-training than casual coffee lovers.

Where Bodum prevails is its balance between simplicity and sustainability. It’s less intimidating than the V60, and unlike Chemex, there’s no need to stockpile filters. Nevertheless, Chemex arguably wins over those craving larger batches or serving multiple guests.

**Smart Spending**

Affordability is another reason why this coffee maker deserves a nod. While premium brewers often break the bank with unnecessary bells and whistles, this stays in a sweet spot between budget-friendly and premium build quality. Given its longevity (hello, borosilicate glass and stainless steel filter), the upfront investment makes more sense.  

If you’re like me and hate ongoing costs like buying paper filters repeatedly, this product ticks all the right boxes. Just ensure it aligns with how often you’ll use it—occasional brewers might not notice all its benefits compared to daily users.

This is a new account since my gf follows my main.  I am one of the 18 or so giants living in the united states. I am 7'6 and nearly 450 lbs. My gf is a completely normal 5'4 girl who likes normal things and cant seem to grasp the realities of being my size. we have been together for 2 years. She met me at a friends wedding.  I do not like to go out in public.  I work from home. I order my groceries delivered and I avoid being in the world as much as possible.  She does not understand what it is like.  I have explained to her that being in public has many challenges. The list of issues for me in public is long so please bare with me but I am going to try and keep it short.  Starting off I can't hear her or have a conversation with her in public. Generally speaking I can barely hear anyone talking to me when i'm standing. not because i'm deaf but to simply put it I am in a different atmosphere.  Factor in the ambient noise of a city with no bodies or masses blocking the sound, it becomes quite loud at my height and cuts off sounds from the lower levels.  I cant really go sit and have coffee or eat at a cafe / restaurant. in a sitting position my knees are above the table height and this assumes I can actually sit in the chair/booth which 99% of the time I can't.  Standard eating utensils require me hold them in such a way that in general make me look mentally challenged while trying to eat. Calling an uber or taxi is generally out of the question and therefor takes going out to a bar or something off the table. A big issue for me is cell phones. Simply because they all have cameras. When I am out you can watch everyone 40 and younger's phone just point to me. as soon as they realize my presence their phones come out. I honestly hate it with a passion and it just bothers me.  I generally try to be open if someone asks if they can take a picture with me. I am more than willing to accommodate that but just recording me doing something just makes me feel like a circus animal.  I have expressed this to her many times and I don't think she gets it. I think she just likes the attention but then gets mad at people and myself when people take up our time asking for a photo or what ever. She recently has started pressing me to go to the mall with her and my response has been why would I ever go there?  Short of the fun of asking the store employees at shoe stores for a size 24 I have no reason to be there.  I do not like the look of sheer terror that little kids give me. either its terrified curious or terrified fear with all the crying. It's just not fun for me and I find it highly damaging to my own morale and mental health.  Now dont get me wrong I am not a hermit, I realized young that it was going to be expensive being my size and have built my finances to do so.  We take extravagant vacations 2x a year usually to beautiful resorts around the world. I do this to offset the fact I don't like being in public. But I just feel it's not enough and for whatever reason she can't seem to fathom what it's like for me even though she sees it and hears me rant about it.  The main reason im asking for advice here is because it is starting to strain my relationship and my own personal feelings about her. As if she enjoys seeing me uncomfortable and bothered. Its making me question everything and starting to drive resentment.  I want to avoid this but what can I do to help her understand this? I have contemplated getting a fisher price toy table set and making her sit at that table to eat just to prove a point but that is honestly just a recipe for disaster. So what can I do?

Picture this, we happened to sit near each other at a café. It’s raining a little outside. I’m halfway through my drink. Somehow we start talking. Nothing deep right away, just casual, easy, human.

Maybe we talk about the coffee. Or how tired we are. Or something random we saw earlier. And then maybe one of us says something real funny or weird, just a little honest, and the other gets it.

That’s the kind of conversation I’m looking for tonight. Doesn’t have to be deep, but it can be. Doesn’t have to be long, but it can be. It can be casual or random. We can talk about your pet, something I’ve been wanting to try, how your say is going, anything.

She pours him some rum and shows him her bedroom, but he leaves before anything can happen. 

He asks Erna about the labor market for ladies. She tells him to get married. He gets drunk with Fred at the bar then goes to the garage. They all go back to the bar. Lenz takes over as bartender. Bob meets up with Pat again before it rains.

They keep the taxi and use it for business. Lohkamp parks in front of a hotel and takes fares. Another driver gets mad because he's the competition. Lohkamp knocks him out. A little later, at the bar, Gustav is his friend. An English woman pays for a drive around the city. He wants to take Pat out in the cab for free. Lenz and Koster want to use it for their friends instead.

The three of them plus Ferdinand, Valentin, and Pat drink wine at an inn and talk about time and the meaning of life. Later, Lenz talks about his trip to Rio and how he missed the lilacs. Pat almost catches Rob in a lie, but Lenz covers for him. They all go for a drive in the country and race a train. They drop Rob and Pat off near his place. She senses he'd rather be with his friends. No, he'd like to be with her.

In the wee hours, Rob sees Lisa, a former lover and prostitute, in the street. He buys her some food, which she reluctantly accepts. She lives in an attic room. She can tell he has a girlfriend. He must go, but she wishes he would stay. It is not to be.

His landlady says Pat is too high class for Rob. Frau Zalewski berates his cheerful nihilism as a “Jewish perversion.” She notices his borrowed suit on a hanger and flounces away. He is going to the theatre with Pat. Her dress is backless and silver. Rob notices the contrast between the haggard tired cabdriver and the theatregoers. He pays more for box seats. He watches her watch [the show](https://share.google/lSDfqUyqcMmSwGKY3) which is more rewarding. 

He got her a glass of orange juice during intermission. When he returns, she is talking to another man named Breuer who wants to meet later at a club. He's an “old friend.” They drive there in his car. Breuer asks her to dance. They wouldn't have gone to a nice club like this if it weren't for her friend. Rob won't dance because he says he doesn't know how. More friends join them, people from another world. One of the men told him that Breuer was still in love with Pat. 

A woman eats him with her eyes. He ignores her and wallows in misery. Breuer drives her home and drops Rob off at the Bar. He plays poker and wins mostly. Grau knows [Weltschmerz](https://share.google/UvinHgVGXAGz2BEdE) when he sees it. Rob asks Lenz to teach him to dance. 

He has one more drink with Rosa as Alois closes up the bar. It's lonely without Pat next to him. Alfons is open. Rob realizes he ruined his chances with Pat and smashes a glass into his hand. He goes home. Pat had waited for him on the stairs by his door and fell asleep. He gets tea for her from Orlow the Russian. She spends the night and stays in the morning. Rob takes the day off and claims he's sick to get the landlady off his back. 

The Baker comes back and asks about the Cadillac. It is already sold, but Rob calls up Blumenthal. He'll give him five hundred marks extra for it. Blumenthal knows he will sell it again for seven thousand. He never misses a deal. The Baker seems stressed and wants Rob to come with him to Ferdinand’s studio. He looks extra long at the portrait and says he can't take it home. It can stay in the studio even if he paid for it. The painter should paint away the brooch though.

They go to his place where his second wife wheedles him for the car. He will trade the Ford worth four thousand marks (way too high a price). Rob values it at two thousand. The Baker agrees. While he gets the money, the second wife propositions Rob for one hundred marks. Rob tells her he has syphilis. The Baker pays in cash. 

Rob takes Pat to the seaside in a Citroën. He can tell the make of a car by its engine noise. He believes money only exists for men to spend it on women. They stay in a villa owned by Fraülein Müller. She likes Pat better than Rob and thinks they are married. Rob asks for a separate room because he snores. 

He remembers when he was on leave in 1917 and spent time on the beach in [Ostend.](https://share.google/k7IrH7fBhO6Ctr19Y) Pat walks towards him like Eve bathed in sunlight and woke him from his memories. She got tired and wanted to go home to rest. He makes her some tea with rum in it. Fraülein Müller drinks some port and comes alive asking about Köster. Rob leaves the door open so Pat can see the rose garden in twilight.

The quiet hum of early morning sets the tone for the day—light filters through the curtains, the air is still, and the world feels paused between night and motion.

1m6fisq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m6fisq/does_the_paris_hilton_french_press_coffee_maker/,Does the Paris Hilton French Press Coffee Maker Redefine Your Morning Routine Review,"**A Touch of Glam to Your Morning Routine**

I’ve recently had the pleasure of testing the **Paris Hilton Paris Hilton French Press Coffee Maker**, and let me just say – it’s hard not to feel a little bit extra while brewing my morning coffee with this stylish piece. With its pink-and-gold design, heart-shaped accent spoon, and temperature-safe glass encased in a golden stainless-steel frame, it's a statement piece for your kitchen. As someone who takes their caffeine rituals seriously (and maybe a bit of personal style too), this coffee press has been a fun addition to my kitchen.

**Positives**
- Stylish design, perfect for pink kitchen decor.
- Durable, temperature-resistant glass and stainless-steel frame.
- Comes with a special heart-shaped spoon for precise measuring.

**Craftsmanship & Design Charm**  
What initially caught my eye is the bold design of this French press. Pink isn’t just a color in this coffee press; it’s practically a mood. The glass feels sturdy, and the golden metallic frame with heart accents gives it a unique appeal that makes other coffee makers look, well, boring. While the heart-shaped scoop looks delicate, it’s actually surprisingly functional, holding just the right amount of coffee grounds to prepare a great cup. I tested it out during a weekend brunch with friends, and believe me, this piece was an instant conversation starter. 

**Ease of Use: A Morning Ritual Simplified**  
Using this coffee press is incredibly straightforward. You just scoop your coarsely ground coffee (bonus points for the adorable heart-shaped measuring scoop), add boiling water, let it steep for about four minutes, and press down the plunger. Easy, right? The reusable filter is fine mesh stainless steel, which prevents pesky grounds from slipping into your coffee. Even my not-so-tech-savvy partner could navigate this one on their first go.  

[View Paris Hilton Paris Hilton pricing on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0b2l1zwjf/)

**Brew Quality & Performance**  
The flavor extraction from this French press is on point. I tried a variety of blends and even some loose-leaf teas over a week, and the results were consistently rich and aromatic. The non-drip spout is a real MVP here – every pour was clean without a single spill. It’s functional enough to take along for a glamping trip or music festival, and it’s compact enough to pack easily. However, if you're someone who brews coffee for a small village (or several coworkers), the 8-cup capacity may feel limiting. It’s perfect for a smaller crowd.  

**Made for the Aesthetic Enthusiast**  
I see this as the perfect gift for anyone obsessed with aesthetic kitchen spaces. If you’re into pink-themed or Instagram-ready decor, this is an easy match. Coffee newbies might enjoy it more for the experience and presentation rather than hardcore functionality, but it delivers on both fronts.

**Downsides**
- Smaller capacity may not suit larger households.
- Some users might prefer a less decorative and more minimalist style.
- Needs handwashing to maintain the finish and longevity.

**Competitors: How It Stands Out**  
Other brands like Bodum offer French presses with a sleek, all-glass modern aesthetic, but what Bodum lacks is personality. This one, with its pink-and-gold details, stands out completely. Meanwhile, Mueller’s French presses lean into stainless steel functionality, promising durability over everything else. If you value a balance between beauty and purpose, I’d pick this every time. Still, if you’re a die-hard minimalist or need a press that can withstand rugged outdoor misuse, the aesthetic might not cut it for you.

**Price-Performance Balance**  
For those budgeting their purchases wisely, this coffee press offers decent value for its dual purpose as a functional tool and decorative piece. Sure, slightly less expensive French presses exist, but they often don’t feature reusable stainless steel filters or this kind of kitchen flair. Considering all it includes – especially the heart-shaped scoop that ties everything together – it’s not just about coffee here. It’s about the experience.

The hours were trash, the pay was trash, but it was mine. I liked having something that was *mine*. That job helped me pay for books, cover gas, and buy myself little things without asking anyone.

But that wasn’t good enough for my dad.

He’s one of those “If it doesn’t match what *I* had to do at your age, it’s not real work” kind of guys. I’m in college, juggling classes and trying to survive like everyone else, and he still makes comments like, *“*You kids don’t know struggle*.”*

Anyway, one afternoon, I came home from a shift, exhausted, and he called me into the living room like he was summoning me to court. I sit down, and he goes, “You’re quitting that job. End of discussion.”

I laughed, thinking he was joking. Nope. Dead serious.

He starts ranting about how it’s not a “respectable” job. How no one in *his* family works for “minimum wage handouts,” and how I should be applying for internships “like real students do.” Never mind that internships don’t pay, and I still have bills. Never mind that I *like* my job and my manager treats me with respect, unlike how he talks to me most days.

I tried standing up for myself. I told him, “You can’t just tell me what to do with my job,” and he snapped: “While you live under my roof, you’ll do as I say.”

That sentence hit me like a brick. Because I knew in that moment I didn’t want to live under his roof anymore.

I didn’t yell. I didn’t argue. I just nodded, went to my room, and started packing. Two duffel bags and a backpack. Called my friend who had a spare room and asked if I could crash for a while. She said yes immediately.

When I came back downstairs with my bags, he looked confused. “Where do you think you’re going?”

I said, “I’m taking your advice. If I’m gonna do things my way, I need to stop living under your roof.”

He didn’t say a word. Just stood there, stunned. My mom cried. My little brother hugged me like I was heading off to war.

Now I’m on a pull-out couch with a broken spring, working a job my dad still thinks is beneath me. But you know what?

Every dollar I make now feels like freedom. Every shift I work reminds me that I don’t need someone else’s approval to live my life.

The AMX is definitely no better than the T100LT, Manticore, and EBR105. However, it's fun in its own way. With good equipment, you have almost exactly 50% camouflage, which allows for good passive spotting. The gun with the clip of 3 is really powerful, especially in the late game. This gives you great carry potential and can often prevail against many opponents.

In my opinion, the tank is often neglected, but it's really fun.

Turns out, they were good friends back in college but lost touch after graduation. I ended up messaging the guy through Facebook (his info was on a business card in the wallet), and when we met up so I could return it, he brought up my dad right away.

They hadn’t spoken in almost 30 years. They ended up grabbing coffee the next day, and now they’ve reconnected like no time passed. It was such a random chain of events, but kind of wild how something small like finding a wallet can bring old friendships back to life.
