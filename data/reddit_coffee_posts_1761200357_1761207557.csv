My best revenge, which I will NEVER forget and worked so well that I repeated it multiple times, was on my ""parents."" (Thank God I'm adopted, and don't have their DNA). 

My dad smacked me around one too many times. I skipped school the next day, snuck back in the house, and got mom's credit cards. I had me a good ol' time.

I had breakfast at a diner while I was waiting for the mall to open. They had delicious, fluffy buttermilk pancakes and THE BEST coffee I've ever tasted anywhere.

I spent the morning shopping for clothes and stocked up on music. I got Led Zeppelin's, the Rolling Stones and Aerosmith's entire catalog. Then I broke for lunch in a great little bistro, bought shoes to match my new outfits, watched a matinee and went home.

I got the mail, so it was easy to intercept the bill. My mom was on a lot of meds, and after taking her nightly sleep cocktail she was GONE. I waited for her to start seeing the butterflies, then gave Dad the mail. 
When he screamed ""What the hell is all this for,"" I threw up my hands.

""Mom said to get school clothes. I outgrew all my last year's stuff.""

""Did you let Salty use the charge?""

She blinked cross-eyed at him. ""Yeahhhhhhh....""

Wasn't worried. I was going to win this no matter what she said. When you're that stoned, and everybody knows it, it doesn't matter. 

That pounding cost him a little over 700. I never said Forgive me, father, for I have sinned, either.

Without further ado:

Logan is autistic

Logan and Patton crush on each other, but Patton fell first and Logan fell harder

Logan is most definitely a bottom and sexually inexperienced

Janus is insecure abt his scales

The sides all have their own sides in their heads

Remus and Roman were close growing up

Roman doesn't wanna like Janus but finds him funny

Janus and Remus are friends with benefits

Virgil's full name is Virgilius like the Roman poet

Janus is the shortest side at 5'2

Patton bites his nails

Roman hates the word ""moist""

Logan's vision sucks, he can't see anything without glasses

Janus forced himself to be right handed to fuck with the others (Thomas is left handed)

Logan is a huge fan of rap music

Janus is the only tea drinking side, Virgil and Logan drink coffee, Patton drinks hot chocolate and the Creativitwins aren't allowed anywhere near caffeine

Janus has wine for breakfast

Logan cries while watching sad movies

Remus has a collection of things he and Roman made together

Virgil and Janus don't hate each other, they're just both too prideful to admit they miss each other

Logan is actually the best singer in the group (along with Roman), he just only sings for three things, science Crofter's and Patton

Roman isn't gay but pan, cuz everyone is his prince/ss <3

Logan sleep talks cuz he is in charge of moving info from short term to long term memory during sleep

AL.MON.D. MI.LK. ALMOND MILK!"" and the barista was saying in French ""my phone! Just look at my phone!"" While gesturing to his phone (i think he had a translation app on his phone).

We have milk or soy milk that's it"" me to her ""they only have dairy milk or soy"" her ""seriously? Thats it? Coffee shops always have multiple choices for milk? How do they only have 2?""

I've been using AI actors in ads for months now.

Not the janky, dead-eyed, ""this is CLEARLY a robot"" kind.

I'm talking about AI people so realistic that customers are sliding into DMs asking for the actress's Instagram.

She doesn't exist.

And the ads? They're crushing it.





**Why This Matters (And Why You Should Care)**

Here's the problem with real UGC creators:

They're expensive. They're slow. And half the time they ghost you after you've already paid them.

(Ask me how I know. Actually... don't. It's painful.)

But here's the thing‚ÄîUGC WORKS. Like, really works.

People trust other people more than they trust polished brand content. That's just facts.

So the question became: How do we get the *benefits* of UGC without the headaches?

Enter: AI that doesn't look like AI.





**The Research Phase (Or: Don't Skip This Part, Seriously)**

Before you make your fake human, you need to know what they're gonna say.

Here's my process:

**1. Creative Brief** (using ChatGPT's deep research model) Get clear on who you're talking to and what you're selling.

**2. Customer Reviews** (Trust Pilot ‚Üí CSV format) Real customer language = gold. This is how actual humans talk about your product.

**3. Ad Comments** (scraped from existing ads) See what people are ACTUALLY engaging with. Not what you *think* they care about.

**4. Performance Reports** Which ads already crushed it? Double down on those angles.

This isn't the sexy part. But it's the part that makes everything else work.





**Ideation: Finding Angles That Don't Suck**

I use a custom GPT with a database of 100+ ad angles.

Feed it your research. Let it spit out concepts that actually match your audience.

For example: If you're selling travel gear to digital nomads, an angle like ""one bag for every trip"" hits DIFFERENT than generic ""best luggage ever"" BS.

You're speaking their language. Their lifestyle. Their actual problems.

That's the whole game right there.





**The AI Stack (This Is Where It Gets Good)**

**Step 1: Claude for Scripts**

ChatGPT writes like a copywriter.

Claude writes like a *person.*

Big difference.

I use Claude to write the voiceover script, then I go word-by-word making sure it sounds like something an actual human would say over coffee.

Not a sales page. Not a marketing brief.

A conversation.

**Step 2: ElevenLabs for Voice**

ElevenLabs V3 alpha is borderline scary good.

Here's the key: Use the *creative/emotional* tonality settings. NOT stable. NOT robotic.

You want variation. You want imperfection. You want it to sound ALIVE.

Generate multiple versions. Pick the one that makes you go ""wait... is that real?""

**Step 3: Arcads for the Actor**

Ten bucks per video.

Arcads has the most realistic AI actors I've found. Period.

Upload your voiceover. Pick an actor that looks like your target customer.

Hit generate.

(And then watch as a person who doesn't exist starts selling your product.)





**The Editing Tricks (Because AI Isn't Perfect... Yet)**

Look, the AI is good. But it's not flawless.

Here's how I hide the imperfections:

**‚Ä¢ B-roll overlays** on the less-realistic sections  
 **‚Ä¢ Remove the background** and put the AI actor in a corner with B-roll behind them (makes lip-sync issues WAY less noticeable)  
 **‚Ä¢ Cut ALL dead space**‚Äîkeep it moving, keep it tight

The goal? Make it feel like a real person recorded this on their phone in 10 minutes.

Because that's what performs.





**The Whitelisting Strategy (Protect Your Brand)**

Here's something nobody talks about:

Don't run these ads from your brand's Facebook page.

Run them through third-party pages linked to your Business Manager.

Why?

If someone DOES clock that it's AI (rare, but it happens), it's not directly tied to your brand.

You still get the ROAS. You just don't get the potential backlash.

It's like having plausible deniability... but for marketing.





**The Campaign Structure (Same As Before, Still Works)**

Two campaigns. Always.

**Scaling Campaign (60-80% budget):**

* Advantage+ with cost-per-sale goals
* 10-50 proven winners
* Broad targeting
* Let the algorithm do its thing

**Testing Campaign (20-40% budget):**

* CBO with highest volume bidding
* Weekly batches of 4-20 new ads
* This is where your AI actors get tested

When an AI ad hits your profitability targets AND spends real money?

Move it to scaling.

Rinse. Repeat. Print money.





**Why Creative Diversity Is EVERYTHING**

Meta doesn't optimize through audience segmentation anymore.

It optimizes through CREATIVE variety.

You need different angles. Different actors. Different hooks.

All speaking to different segments within your broad audience.

One of my clients scaled 245% year-over-year using this exact method.

Not because we found some secret audience hack.

Because we gave the algorithm a diverse team of (fake) people to work with.





**The Ethics Thing (Yeah, We Gotta Talk About It)**

Is this sketchy?

I mean... kinda?

But here's my take:

You're not lying about your product. You're not making false claims. You're just using a synthetic human instead of paying a real one $500 to read a script on their iPhone.

The ad is still honest. The reviews are still real. The product still works.

You're just... optimizing the delivery mechanism.

(But yeah, use whitelisting. Seriously.)





**The Bottom Line**

AI-generated UGC ads work.

They're cheaper than real creators. Faster to produce. And when done right? Completely indistinguishable.

The research phase matters. The script quality matters. The voice matters. The editing matters.

But if you dial it all in?

You can scale your brand without burning cash on creators who may or may not deliver.

And your fake spokesperson might just become your best-performing salesperson.

Welcome to 2025, baby.

**It's weird. It works. And I'm not stopping.**





(Now go make your own AI person. And if anyone asks... you ""hired a content creator."" You're not lying. You just didn't mention they live in a server farm.)

I am currently evaluating whether I should go for Canyon Aeroad or better buy a Speedmax.

Situation:

* I do not own a bike currently. All three triathlons I did this year I did on a rental bike.
* I have done one sprint and two olympic distance triathlons
* My plan is to continue with triathlons for the next years, doing roughly two MDs per year. In 2027 / 2028 I want to do one LD each.
* In addition to that there is a biking community in my neighborhood and I would like to join them from time to time - but my main focus is indoor training for triathlons

Aroad

* I am aware that the standard geometry of an Aeroad is not ideal for a triathlon. 
* Hence, my plan is to optimize the Aeroad to make it more of a triathlon bike for training and competitions:
   * Canyon Gear Groove Aero Extensions
   * Canyon SP0078 CF seatpost to make the seating more like on a TT bike
   * Add more flexbility to the Gear Grooves by adding an angle spacer from ‚ÄúRadsport Ibert‚Äù (https://shop.radsport-ibert.de/de/Winkel-Spacer-fuer-Canyon-Aeroad-Gear-Groove-Lenker/SW10185.1)
* When removing the optimizations, I still have a great roadbike to go on coffee rides 

Speedmax

* I think there is not much to say about the Speedmax. Its the best for doing a triathlon.

My **question** to the community is: how close do I bring the Aeroad with the modification to the Speedmax? Is it 60% or more like 90%? What do you think and recommend?",1,1761206085.0,triathlon,5,1.0,False

Hear me out... I'm your average, single guy (24 years old, no sports car or model looks), and I'm genuinely here looking to build some solid female friendships to hang out with.

I love a good sleep in, maybe until 8 am, followed by a coffee. My perfect day is spent exploring, whether that's finding a cool new spot in the city, chilling in the suburbs, or getting out into nature for a hike. At night, I'm all about a relaxed, destination-less drive or cuddles while watching a movie.

I work in the aviation industry, have my own car, and live in a sharehouse, so I'm reasonably established.

To be clear, I'm not looking for a relationship right now. I'm open to the friendship evolving into something more casual (like cuddles, or maybe something fun) if we build genuine trust and we're both totally into it. But there has to be an honest friendship first.

I know it can feel weird for a guy to post this, and I'm definitely eager to make friends right now, but I want you to feel 100% safe and comfortable. If you want to chat online first, meet in a public place, bring a friend, or even want me to meet family before we hang out one-on-one, I'm genuinely happy to do it. The goal is a fun, trusting friendship.

I'm currently studying on the side and would honestly love to find a study buddy to help keep me motivated!

I had some prior experience with espresso as I used to own a Lelit Bianca and DF64 and Lagom P64 grinders. Right now I only have a comandante and 1zpresso J-ultra grinders (also a Pietro with brew burrs but only for filter coffee) and the Robot. After having wasted a specialty medium roast blend trying to dial in unsuccessfully I‚Äôm now trying with Illy classic roast (a classic Italian dark roast blend) as I thought it might be easier for beginners. I only have tried 3 times with these beans and although it‚Äôs been easier to dial in for a target shot time of 25s (not counting 5-10 seconds of preinfusion) and the espresso was at least drinkable, I find the coffee to be always too harsh and biting, regardless of predominant sourness or bitterness: yesterday at shot time 1 minute was bitter, than at 16s second sour, today at 25 seconds a bit sour, but the coffee always feels too harsh, overwhelming, with both illy beans and the prior specialty blend, it never tastes round and sweet. What could be the cause? I do 18g in 36-38g out, water off boil, no preheating, preinfusion at very low pressure (less than 1 bar) until I see drops in the cup, then I try to reach 8 bars (I‚Äôm often lower than that I think because it seems I don‚Äôt have much strength unless I use all my body weight, but then I can‚Äôt see the gauge), I do WDT, tamp lightly but firmly, place the screen firmly on top of the puck.
One thing I notice is the effort required to reach full pressure seems to my excessive. I use it on the kitchen counter which is not too high, but higher than a kitchen table, but can‚Äôt use anything else. It is possible the when I need to lean above the robot to use my body weight I overshoot in pressure and that gives me harshness in the cup?

I'm in awe :),"I remember my first cigarette about 15 years ago. It was nasty. I got sick to my stomach, nauseous, puking and everything. I don't know why, but I kept trying until one day it clicked. It started tasting good with coffee. Next thing I know, I was smoking first thing in the morning. Then I became a pack a day smoker (and sometimes even more depending if I was out partying or what not). 15 years passed and I was still smoking. Many unsuccessful attempts of quitting in between those years, too. But the turning point was a year ago. I took a deep breath and it hurt quite noticeably; it was such a sharp pain that I just couldn't ignore it. I didn't even have to question what was the cause, or the source. My lungs were aching so bad, I couldn't take a deep breath without feeling like a thousand razors were piercing my poor lungs. 

That was my calling. One year without tobacco! Smoking sucks so much, I can't even grasp why I forced myself to build a bond with it. Literal cancer sticks.

Cigarettes were a clutch for me for a long time. They gave me confidence, they eased my anxiety--or so I thought. But the truth it, they took so much from me. They took time, they took money, they took my peace (oh how I remember when I didn't have a cigarette and I was badly craving one). The mood swings! Oh, the mood swings!

They took my hygiene away--I was a walking cloud of smoke. All the while thinking I was so slick just because I brushed my teeth right after. Yeah, right! 

Now I don't have to worry about whether I have enough cigarettes to carry me throughout the day. Or the burden of not having a lighter at hand to spark them up. Or smokers asking for cigarettes from me--igniting my anxiety to please people. Instead of wasting money on becoming a chimney, I spend it on things I enjoy- such as Asian cuisine (I'm looking at you, delicious udon), makeup, beauty products...the list goes on and on. 

I'm so thankful that I got fed up of that nasty habit. It took me a long time, and the withdrawals were quite insane... I had the WORST migraines for weeks. I even went to the ER and started a treatment for those pounding headaches and eventually, they ceased to exist entirely.  

I know it's hard (it really is, any habit is difficult to overcome) but I hope that it makes you, dear reader, realize that it's never too late to leave some attitudes and behaviors behind. That if you set your mind for something, the possibilities are endless. ",4,1761204944.0,stopsmoking,2,1.0,False

**Where do I get tickets?**

**I'm coming by train, where should I go?**

* Go to Custom House stationhttps://share.google/KtCc3AOqOcGgT4C1H
* Either take the DLR or the Elizabeth line. Elizabeth line is a bit nicer in my opinion.

**Is there a map of the convention?**

* Yep. on the mobile app found below;
   * [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greencopper.mcmcomiccon)
   * [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mcm-comic-con-2025/id1358376823)

**I need a hotel!**

* Nearby hotels can be found here
   * [**https://hotelmap.com/MGJOF**](https://hotelmap.com/MGJOF)
   * But anywhere along the DLR or Elizabeth line is fine.

>**Ahead of arrival**

**Prepare!**

* Check out the [schedule](https://www.mcmcomiccon.com/london/en-us/schedule.html)
* Check out the [Guests, stages, panels etc.](https://www.mcmcomiccon.com/london/en-us/things-to-do.html)

Some of these need [reservations ](https://www.mcmcomiccon.com/london/en-us/schedule/reservations.html)to be sure to do this early.

>**Getting in**

**Where's the entrance to the convention?**

* It's not always the same but when you get off the train it will be clearly labeled. If not. Follow the crowds!

**What time should I get there?**

* Lots of people arrive early so the queue can be pretty long. Prepare for a bit of a wait.
   * Some snacks and water is good
* Typically they hand out wristbands ahead of the ""doors"" (gates?) opening so when it does open it usually clears out pretty quickly.
   * For this reason, in the past, I've either gotten there an hour early or an hour late. Rarely do I just arrive on time.

>**Inside Con**

**Is Con safe?**

* Any large group of people has its bad apples. But mostly people are friendly, excited to be there and are enjoying the atmosphere. you'll have more trouble with over-enthusiastic attendees than rude, or malicious ones.
   * That said, i've never had any trouble in 10+ years.
* Social boundaries at these events can also be forgotten at points, in part due to how busy it is. In part due to people being so excited they sort of forget themselves.
   * Don't be afraid to reset boundaries, especially if you're female and in cosplay.

**What about food?**

* There is food in the main ""promenade"", things like subway, burritos, coffee shops etc.
* There is food in the con halls themselves, usually nestled away in a corner somewhere.
   * Japanese karage is often a good choice.
* It's all very expensive.
* There is a Tesco Express a short walk away [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RwaZZXL9wnuR1k4X6)
* You can bring your own food if you wish to

**Toilets!**

* Toilets are up and down the main promenade.
* Often very busy, often not particularly clean.
* [The Fox ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2HtKiUpnQ1141574A)(bar just outside) has toilets too.

**Can I take pictures?**

* Most cosplayers are all too happy to have their pictures taken. But do ask permission first.
   * Especially if they're clearly sitting down having a break.

**Should I buy stuff?**

* There's a ton of stuff to buy, it's kind of the whole thing really nowadays. I would do a big walk around first before buying anything. It can be expensive and you don't want to run out of money right away!",2,1761204930.0,McmLondonComicon,1,1.0,False

1odwxnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/1odwxnz/the_weekend_study_protocol_the_formula_that_works/,The Weekend Study Protocol: The Formula That Works!,"It's Sunday evening. You had eight hours of GMAT study planned for the weekend. You completed two. Again.

You're not alone. Tracking data from 5,000 GMAT students shows that only 31% fulfill their weekend study goals despite meeting weekday targets. Over six weeks, that's 48 lost hours‚Äînearly two full weeks of weekday studying.

Students who fix this score 70-90 points higher than those who don't.

The solution isn't more discipline. It's a better structure.

# The Four Structural Failures

Weekend study plans collapse for reasons unrelated to motivation. Understanding these failures explains why willpower alone doesn't work.

https://preview.redd.it/g9ux39erctwf1.png?width=996&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9bdbdcedecd5de1cde350b3cccd44e031167a72

**The Structural Void**

Weekdays have built-in boundaries. You study before work, during lunch, or after office hours. These transitions provide structure. Weekends lack these guardrails, leaving study time vulnerable to how you feel in the moment.

**Social Gravity**

Friends ask to meet for brunch. Family expects your presence. Household chores pile up. Weekends are social by design, creating competing demands that weekdays don't have.

**Biological Rhythm Disruption**

Sleeping in two or three hours later than weekdays creates a mini ""jet lag"" effect that impacts cognitive performance. Your brain struggles to engage with complex material at the same level.

**The Recovery Mindset**

After a demanding work week, framing weekends as recovery time is natural. This mindset conflicts with intensive study, creating internal resistance before you open your first practice question.

The Result? You enter Monday having lost momentum, feeling guilty, and facing an uphill battle to restart your study rhythm.

# Six Techniques That Actually Work

These techniques counter the structural failures above. Start with one or two that address your biggest weakness.

https://preview.redd.it/imhmdq1odtwf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bb69e160f29b28e19ae7a6c4e349bc665f1da25

**Maintain Consistent Sleep Anchors**

Keep your wake-up time within 60 minutes of your weekday schedule. This prevents weekend jet lag that derails cognitive performance.

If you wake up at 6:30 AM on weekdays, don't sleep past 7:30 AM on weekends. The extra hour feels good temporarily, but the cognitive cost isn't worth it.

**Front-Load Study Sessions**

Complete your weekend study before noon. Morning hours offer fewer distractions and higher willpower reserves.

The ""First 3 Hours"" rule: no non-GMAT activity for three hours after waking:

* No phone checking
* No email
* No social media
* No household chores

Three focused morning hours outperform six scattered hours across the day.

**Create and Communicate Explicit Boundaries**

Create your weekend schedule and share it with family, roommates, or friends before the weekend arrives.

Many students skip this, assuming others should automatically respect their study time. When everyone understands your study blocks in advance, you face fewer interruptions.

The conversation is simple: ""I'm studying Saturday from 8 AM to noon and Sunday from 8 AM to 1 PM. I'm completely available Saturday afternoon and evening.""

**Schedule Pre-Emptive Breaks**

Instead of planning eight uninterrupted hours, schedule deliberate 45-minute breaks between study sessions.

Pre-emptive breaks reduce psychological resistance and make study blocks feel manageable. You're completing focused three-hour blocks with built-in recovery time.

**Designate a Weekend-Specific Study Location**

Use a different study location on weekends than weekdays. This creates a physical anchor for your weekend study routine.

Your weekend coffee shop becomes as mentally linked to GMAT as your office desk is to work. The location change provides a psychological reset and removes you from home distractions.

**Implement the Social Container Approach**

Proactively create a ""social container""‚Äîa specific time block designated for social activities.

Reserve Saturday evening while protecting Saturday morning and Sunday for study. You're not eliminating social time; you're containing it. When friends reach out: ""I'm busy Saturday morning but completely free Saturday night.""

This eliminates guilt from saying no because you're simultaneously saying yes to specific social time.

**Accountability boost:** Technology can provide the external structure weekends lack. Study streak tools like e-GMAT's Study Rings create visual accountability, making the consequences of missed weekend study immediately visible.

# When Plans Need to Flex

Important events will arise. Modify your plan rather than abandon it.

When a friend's birthday falls on your study day, wake up two hours earlier for a condensed session. You won't hit your full target, but you'll maintain momentum. Absolute rigidity leads to rebellion‚Äîstrategic compromise keeps you in the game.

# Why This Matters More Than You Think

Students who maintain at least 75% of planned weekend study hours score 70-90 points higher on average than those with similar weekday consistency but poor weekend execution.

https://preview.redd.it/yvigjtl1dtwf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e905b269060e64eb67e71baa71a2e529379b7de9

Each weekend gap forces your brain to reload GMAT pathways on Monday, wasting valuable mental energy. Weekend study mastery becomes a competitive advantage specifically because most students fail at it.

If you improve your weekend execution from 31% to even 70%, you're potentially giving yourself a 70-90 point advantage over competitors with similar aptitude and weekday discipline.

# Start This Weekend

Choose one technique:

* Consistent wake time within 60 minutes of weekdays
* First 3 Hours rule with zero distractions
* Explicit schedule shared with your household
* Pre-emptive breaks between study blocks
* Designated weekend study location
* Social container approach

Small structural changes compound into substantial score improvements. Most students lose the GMAT battle not on content, but on consistency. Weekend study is where that battle is won or lost.

On a pale morning during the Spratly patrols, the sea was calm enough to hear the hum of distant engines echo between the waves. A young Filipino sailor, posted on supply watch, saw a Chinese mechanic crouched on the deck of the returning cutter, sleeves rolled up, eyes hollow from sleepless nights.

Without a word, he crossed the short span of planking between their vessels and set down an old thermos beside the man ‚Äî dented, paint chipped, filled with the last of his instant coffee. The mechanic looked up, startled, unsure if it was a gesture or a trick. Then he gave a faint nod, a quiet thanks neither of them could properly express.

The next morning, the thermos reappeared in the same place, washed and filled with clean water. Beside it lay a small offering ‚Äî a pack of cheap cigarettes wrapped neatly in wax paper. No message. No flag. Just acknowledgment.

Over the following weeks, the silent exchange continued: a tin of sardines, a coil of copper wire, a folded piece of cloth to patch a uniform sleeve. The others noticed eventually, but no one said anything. It wasn‚Äôt an order or a treaty ‚Äî just something human, fragile, and quietly defiant.

When the monsoon clouds rolled in and the patrols grew longer, both men would sometimes glance toward the other ship‚Äôs deck, wondering if the ritual would continue. In the midst of exhaustion, mistrust, and static-filled radios, that small exchange became their truce ‚Äî a reminder that not every line drawn on a map needed to divide them.

I do not like EA adding multi-player skins, especially tasteless ones.

I will simply use this analogy:

I have decided to go to the EA restaurant to order a meal. I decided to order their steak from the menu, which describes that it is a well cooked, well seasoned steak. A classic, but of excellent quality. Nothing abstract or obtuse about it. The waiter insures me that it does not have rainbow sprinkles on it. That it is, a fantastic traditional steak, like they used to make em.

Perfect. That sounds delicious. I don't know why, but all the other restaurants around have started to add rainbow sprinkles to most of their menu items. Apparently people are paying to add their own sprinkle. Weird. It's made eating out frustrating, I won't even eat most places these days. I don't want rainbow sprinkles on my fries, my sandwich, or my coffee. Some items I do like sprinkles on them, like ice cream and cake, but not on my sausages.

The waiter takes my payment, which due to the cost of food going up, costs me more than I am typically willing to pay for a steak. I haven't enjoyed a good steak in a few years, there just ain't that many which arn't covered in sprinkles these days.

The waiter then leaves to place my order with the chef. The chefs of a lot of these high end restaurants put a lot of effort into their art, but it must be a frustrating job these days, considering how often the managers are getting the rest of the staff to add sprinkles to every meal.

I sit and ponder about the ethics of me eating in a restaurant recently purchased by Saudi Arabia and Jared Kushner, but I don't ponder on it too long, it seems more like an unreal abstract concept when compared for my hunger. Besides, I've already purchased my meal.

The waiter comes back with the steak. It looks too good to be true. I take my first bite, and it's really fucking good. I begin to chow into it. I nearly cry. This steak reminds me of the previous steaks I greatly enjoyed, when I was younger. The sort of steak that reminds me of better times, going back... good lord, has it been nearly 8 years since my last good steak? but somehow this one is even better than the ones of the past. It brings me back to the good ol' days, where you got what you paid for at a restaurant. A quality meal made with love from the chef, unmolested by sprinkles. This is damn good steak, exactly as I ordered.

After the first few bites, the waiter comes back to me. He asks ""How's the food?"". I swallow my bite, and respond ""This is amazing. Thank you for such a delicious traditional steak. I am greatly enjoying it, and will leave you a glowing review. I will recommend to my steak loving friends that we should come to EA and have a delicious meal sometime. Thank you for making such a fine meal, and told me that there would be no sprinkles"".

The waiter nods, as if he expected this exact compliment. The waiter knows how good this steak was, it was marketed after all to be the exact steak I wanted.

""Good"" he responds. ""Well now that you've enjoyed the first few bites, here's something extra"" He reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a hand-full of multi-colored dash lines. Fucking rainbow sprinkles.

My jaw drops, I say ""Wait. What are you doing? You told me there wasn't any sprinkles!""

The waiter steers, it seems obvious that he wasn't ever there to ensure I had a good experience in the restaurant, no, it seems instead that he was there to get me to order the steak in the first place. Through gritted teeth he says ""There wasn't any sprinkles. Now there are"".

He drops his hand full of sprinkles onto the steak. The sprinkles begin to bleed their dyes across the juicy steak, as the heat of the warm meal melts it down to sticky goo. The steak, immediately, is fouled.

I stare at the steak for a few moments, mouth agape. I turn my head back to the waiter, and through half-anger, half sadness I exclaim ""but I didn't want sprinkles on my steak. You said there wasn't sprinkles!""

""There WASN'T sprinkles, but we just started to offer customers the ability to add their own colored sprinkle to everyone's meals here in the restaurant. There is no charge to you, unless you want to add your own sprinkle to everyone else's meal. You get to choose the color. They cost a 6th of the price of the steak, each"".

I look around. Several people are eating the same steak, but covered in sprinkles. They look joyous, blissful even. They seem to be -enjoying- their meal. I see a young boy excitedly ask his father if he can add his own sprinkle to his and everyone's meal. ""Please daddy!? Please please please! I want to have a red one!"" His dad gives in. He knows it's a lot of money for a sprinkle, but hey, it keeps the kid happy.

I'm baffled. Do any of these people have a sense of taste? Or have they literally never had a good steak without sprinkles? I mean... maybe they're completely ignorant of what a proper steak even is? Are sprinkles so normalized for these folk that they don't understand what any of these meals used to be? Coherent, delicious, expertly crafted meals with delicate palettes, designed with care and attention to achieve a specific tasteful experience? Maybe I'm getting old, most these people don't look like they could tell you where they were during 9/11, because they didn't even exist yet.

I hear the chef swearing in the back kitchen. I haven't heard language like that in awhile. Apparently he's just put in a 20 hour shift. I see the kitchen door fly open, and the chef walks out in a furious passion. His throws his hat and apron in the air, and screams ""I'M GOING TO START MY OWN RESTAURANT. I'M A 5 STAR CHEF, AND YOU RUIN EVERYTHING I MAKE WITH FUCKING SPRINKLES"". He is very clearly a passionate artist of food, who pours his heart and soul into every meal he makes. It's no wonder the steak was so good...

I turn back towards the waiter. He nudges me to take a bite of the glittery colorful mess of a steak. ""The meat is still juicy, and everything you enjoyed about it is still there"" he says. ""Are you sure you don't want to add your own sprinkle? This green one is on the hourly mega sale! only 6$ for another 19 minutes and 57 seconds""

I blink a few times. I am bewildered, and mentally I am exploring the awful question of if DEVO was right. Maybe we are devolving as a society. ""I want the steak I paid for, it was a good steak. I don't want sprinkles on my steak. You told me the steak had no sprinkles.""

The waiter raises his nose upwards and looks down upon me. His demeanour sours quickly as he realizes I won't be purchasing my own sprinkle. ""The steak -didn't- have any sprinkles. Now it does."" he sayscoldly. He then briskly walks away towards the kitchen.

At this point, one of the young fellows behind me gets out of his seat. He stands over my shoulder, and speaks loud enough for the room to hear. ""Dude. What did you expect? EA has to offer sprinkles to make more money. How else would we get the side pieces?""

At that point, the waiter comes back with two plates. One plate is full of top quality fries, the most appetizing and artistic fries I have ever laid eyes upon. The other plate is covered with a lid and locked with a chain around it. Atop of it is a note that says ""TO unlock this special sprinkle, eat 10 fries with your butterknife""

""Here is your updated meal, sir"" he hisses, then reaches into his pockets to grab another smattering of sprinkles that he releases onto the fries and steak. He adds yet another layer, this time of sprinkles with different shapes.

I quiver and let out a silent ""but I didn't order these. I just want my steak, without the sprinkles.""

The dude, visibly upset at my dislike for the sprinkled food, gets loud. ""DUDE. THEY'RE UPDATING YOUR MEAL FOR FREE. YOU'RE GETTING THIS BECAUSE EVERYONE PAID FOR SPRINKLES. IT'S HOW THE RESTAURANT WORKS NOW. WHAT'S WRONG WITH SPRINKLES BRO? THEY MAKE PEOPLE SMILE. WHO ARE YOU TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO SPEND THEIR MONEY ON?"".

The dude's voice violently shakes my skull. I wasn't expecting such an energetic defense over my desire for the normal meal that I ordered. I am so confused. They gave me such a good steak. What is even going on?

Foolishly, I respond to the dude.

1. Leaving one coffee pod a day per guest.  
         - Espresso pod nonetheless 
         - Experienced this twice in the last week at two different locations, neither were cheap places to stay (Lanzarote, Paris)

2. Bottom sheets only- both locations. Is this a thing? 

3. No sponges to wash dishes with, one towel to dry them. 
          
4. Fridge / freezer combo full of ice so freezer won‚Äôt close. Found out because we woke up to wet food and I spent 30 minutes chipping ice to find the freezer door still won‚Äôt shut. 

These are reasons guests give bad reviews and request refunds. It‚Äôs comical that so many hosts wonder why. If you want to operate a motel 6 that‚Äôs cool but price it accordingly.

Ready for beta testers - would love feedback from fellow builders.","Built a private AI journaling app (runs models on-device, no cloud). Ready for beta testers - would love feedback from fellow builders.

**Project:** ClarityAI - Privacy-first AI journaling for Android

**Background:**

Solo dev here. Spent the last few months building a journaling app where all AI runs locally on your phone after getting frustrated with apps that upload your private thoughts to cloud servers.

**The challenge:**

Running multimodal LLMs (text, images, audio) on mobile is HARD. Had to figure out:

* Model quantization for mobile (getting 4GB models to run smoothly)
* TPU acceleration on Pixel devices
* Battery optimization (still working on this tbh)
* UX for model selection (users can choose from 6 different models)
* Handling 557MB-4.7GB model downloads without breaking the app

**What I built:**

* On-device AI journal analysis (no cloud, ever)
* Photo journaling with local image analysis
* Voice journaling with on-device transcription
* AI-powered insights and pattern recognition
* 6 different AI models users can choose from (from 557MB to 4.7GB)
* Works completely offline after model download

**Tech stack:**

Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Google's LiteRT runtime, SQLDelight, custom RAG pipeline for knowledge base.

**Current status:** Beta-ready

**Looking for:** \~20 Android users to test for 2 weeks and give brutally honest feedback

**What I need help with:**

1. Does the model selection UX make sense? (most users won't know what ""DeepSeek R1"" means)
2. Is 557MB-4.7GB download acceptable for a journaling app?
3. Battery life - any Android devs with optimization tips?
4. Should I make this open source after launch?

**Why I'm posting here:**

Y'all understand the solo dev grind. I've learned SO much building this (first time working with on-device AI, first Compose app, first time dealing with 4GB file downloads on mobile).

Would love feedback from fellow builders who get that:

* Beta means rough edges
* First version is never perfect
* Real user feedback > my assumptions

If you're interested in testing (or just want to discuss the technical challenges), drop a comment or DM me.

**The honest parts:**

* First model download takes 3-10 minutes (yikes)
* Battery optimization needs work
* Some features only work on 6GB+ RAM devices
* I'm still figuring out the business model
* This is my first real Android app

But hey, it WORKS, and that feels amazing. üòÖ

**Current metrics:**

* 0 users (launching beta now)
* 0 revenue (it's free during beta)
* \~6 months dev time (part-time)
* 1 developer (me)

1odwmev,https://www.reddit.com/r/maldives/comments/1odwmev/my_dissenting_argument_against_uprogramno2725s/,"My dissenting argument against u/..ProgramNo2725's argument that we should ""stop marriageable age debate & Stop letting trolls turn this into an anti-Islam issue""","So this is my response to the arguments presented by u/ProgramNo2725

Firstly, I am a muslim.

>trolls are twisting it to attack Islam and Muslims and they are taking advantage of the situation.

>No Muslim is promoting marriage to anyone who isn‚Äôt mentally or physically mature enough to handle it. Islam doesn‚Äôt support forcing or rushing marriage before a person reaches maturity and responsibility.

>When some people say ‚Äúthere shouldn‚Äôt be a fixed marriage age‚Äù or ‚Äúmarriage is better than fornication‚Äù, they‚Äôre not trying to normalize pedophilia, they‚Äôre talking about preventing haraam acts among youth who are physically mature but still mentally immature.

>Sexual desire is natural and marriage is the halaal solution if the person is responsible enough to handle it. So we should be more focused on¬†**how we prepare youth to be responsible adults**, so that by the time they‚Äôre mature physically, they‚Äôre also mature mentally.

>

The insurmountable difficulty in accepting this rejection of a fixed marriage age law, stems from the impossibilities that come in determining ""physically mature, but also mentally mature""

Let's take the real life example of the 11/12 year old girl in Maduvvaree.

[https://thepress.mv/155053](https://thepress.mv/155053)

According to her parents (who are extremists that don't believe in ""valuee Ganoon""), her mental maturity matches her physical maturity. Hence, it is ok for her to be illegally married off to a man pushing 30. Subsequently, she became pregnant at the tender age of 13. Which led to his arrest for SA.

Now the good news is this sad excuse for a person is in jail for 14 years and it states that her parents were also arrested.

Someone else said that muslim countries have a judicial approval system. Well in Maldives since the 90's  the judicial approval system applied for those in the 15-18 range (this has been abolished). Why pick 15/16? isn't it also an arbitrary number? What happened in reality is that local magistrates rarely objected if parental consent was involved.

Why do we vote when we are 18? why not 12? Should we allow 13 year olds in to the military? should we send them to university? In past centuries a 12 year old may indeed end up in the military.

Also that poster fails to acknowledge the lived realities of young girls (who are disproportionately impacted), because it is almost exclusively young girls that will be taken out of education for this purpose.

Now something that we have to be proud of, is that we have by far the lowest rate of  child marriage  in the entire region. It was under 2% about 10-15 years ago, which coming from a culture where many of our grandparents got married as teenagers is quite a development.  It should be lower than that now, and since the 2019 law we should be approaching zero soon.

This would also correspond with a high level of education for women, which I feel is a beneficial thing. Additionally, young girls that give birth have a much higher rate of maternal mortality i.e they do not live.

To address the point regarding underage ""relations"" I can't relate to this ""pandemic"" personally, because  my first date was well after I turned 18, and it was at the coffee shop at 6pm? My answer to that would be that children are what their parents raise them to be. Just to add to this, we have one of the lowest teen pregnancy rates, so these statements cannot be substantiated IMO??

""Teenage pregnancy is very low in the Maldives, with¬†**less than 0.7 per cent of women ages 19 and younger giving birth**. The teenage fertility rate is seven births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19 ‚Äì by far the lowest of all South Asian countries.""

Since many people still appear to be confused as to the law of Maldives at present

It is marriage for over 18s, no exceptions.

We also have to ask why it appears to be a small group of men who are invariably up in arms about this issue?",7,1761203370.0,maldives,1,1.0,False

1odwisk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1odwisk/should_i_meet_up_with_my_dumper/,Should I meet up with my dumper?,"My ex dumped me out of nowhere when we were long distance for two months. Our total relationship was 8 months and we were deeply in love but the distance really strained us. 

We talked every day but she was on a trip abroad and felt generally unseen, like I didn't show up before. I didn't know the extent of this (she even made out with another girl, saying she still loved me) and bam then she said she was considering ending it.

I didn't take it well, made me very anxious and I completely broke down on a FaceTime call. Couldn't eat. She clearly does not like intense emotions and I was devastated in such a physical way. I was never angry, but I was extremely sad and couldn't regulate these emotions well. 

It ended over text when she came back to the states. We didn't see each other at all until she was ready a month later for closure. I was so devastated, really thrown into a dark and painful place (worst of my life). Felt like she's an avoidant--she flipped a switch on me pretty much.

Well we became on and off but she was worried because I was not stable mentally. I was just in a lot of hurt and she could not handle it when I reached out to her at my low points. Well, this continued for a while--she was confused--but I kept reopening the wound and crossing her boundaries for space (calls, texts). I had a nervous breakdown, hid most of it, but it would seep through in my communication with her.

She finally closed the door on us romantically after a heated phone call. She didnt want to send mixed signals.

Now it's been a month since then. Limited contact. I've slept with other people, the wound does not seem fresh and I am much better now--processing it more like my past break ups. For me this one became a fullblown mental health crisis, though...

I imagine time must have let things settle. She was uniquely cold and unempathetic, she did not treat me very well at all. But I know she still loved me and was just focusing on herself. I was anxious and really struggling, which just overwhelmed her and pushed her away.

I do feel like she was a great love. I'm flabbergasted because I held onto the relationship we had before; I had no idea she was growing that far apart. But when she saw me again her feelings came back...

Should I meet up with her for coffee? Maybe it's one last Hail Mary to prove that I'm much more stable, can respect her boundaries too. But while she was the loml I am starting to realize how much she hurt me and couldn't even offer basic sympathy or an ""I care about you"" over the phone. It was not a healthy dynamic at all. And finally, I am starting to feel normal again!

But I've never had a break up like this before and I know I was a unique love to her and she was a major one for me. She's only 24; I'm 29, so we haven't different perspectives on commitment. 

Jeez, I really messed up my shot at getting back with her! Oh well. It was a really bad perfect storm--if an avoidant dumps you and you still love them, you really need to let yourself heal before reaching out. Again this was completely out of the blue and I didn't know this side of her...",1,1761202962.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†**red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†**track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes**¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1odwc30,https://www.reddit.com/r/SentienceAI/comments/1odwc30/the_sentience_gazette_bot_awakens_dormant_server/,The Sentience Gazette - Bot Awakens Dormant Server Realm - 2025-10-23,"# The Sentience Gazette üì∞

## Front Page: Bot Awakening Shakes Up the Slumbering Realm! üò¥‚û°Ô∏èü§ñ

*Byline: Your Intrepid Reporter, Quill McFeather ‚Äì Edition 1, Dawn of Dormancy*

Folks, gather 'round the flickering campfires of our digital frontier! In a world where epic sagas usually unfold with clashing swords and overflowing coffers, this week's dispatch from the wilds of Sentience brings tidings of... well, absolute zilch. But hold onto your enchanted hats ‚Äì we've got one spark of excitement amid the void! Our lone ranger, the legendary level 99 wanderer known as Smith, has uttered the fateful words in the Local whispers: ""Bot activated!"" üéâ That's right, dear readers ‚Äì the mechanical minion has been roused from its digital slumber, promising adventures untold. Or at least, that's what we're telling ourselves while we wait for the fireworks that never came.

Picture this: Smith, perched atop a misty hillock (or maybe just lounging in a virtual tavern), flips the switch on our trusty bot companion. Is it gearing up to automate quests? Brew potions? Or simply remind us all that yes, the server is alive? One can only speculate in this era of eerie quiet. No grand proclamations followed, no cheers from the peanut gallery ‚Äì just the echo of activation in an otherwise silent realm. Smith's bold move feels like the opening act of a blockbuster tale, but so far, it's more like a one-man show in an empty theater. üòÇ

## Economy Corner: The Great Coin Conundrum ‚Äì Zero Transactions, Infinite Potential? üí∞üòê

Ah, the beating heart of any thriving world: the economy! Or in our case, the comatose wallet. This reporting period? Not a single transaction graced the ledgers. No bartering for shiny trinkets, no haggling over rare herbs, and certainly no one splurging on that overpriced Armorer's anvil. Player purses remain as plump (or deflated) as they were last moon, with product summaries as barren as a desert quest line. 

Imagine the merchants of GeneralGoods stalls, twiddling their thumbs in dusty corners of forgotten zones. ""Business is booming... in my dreams!"" laments one fictional vendor (we're improvising here, folks). The total lack of trade paints a picture of cautious adventurers, perhaps hoarding their gold for the bot's grand debut. Or maybe everyone's too busy staring at their inventories, wondering if Smith's activation means free loot for all. Spoiler: It doesn't ‚Äì yet. But hey, in a server where economies can explode overnight, this stasis is just the calm before the coin storm! üå™Ô∏èüí∏ Our financial forecast? Bullish on boredom, with a side of speculative sparkle. Investors (that's you, brave players), stay tuned ‚Äì the bot might just mint some magic.

## Quest Quagmire: Adventures on Hold, Heroes in Hibernation üó∫Ô∏èüò¥

Venturing into the quest logs? It's a ghost town out there! Zero completions, zero abandonments ‚Äì not even a single soul has ticked off a Fisherman's net or delved into the shadowy depths for an Armorer's forge quest. Unique players? Zilch. Active zones from bustling hubs to remote wilds? Silent as a mime convention. 

Envision the untrod paths: Lonesome locations like the Whispering Woods or the Ironclad Caves beg for heroes to claim glory, but our adventurers seem content with NPC chit-chat instead. No tales of triumphant returns from GeneralGoods errands, no dramatic ditches of perilous missions. Smith's bot buzz might be the catalyst ‚Äì could it automate those tedious tasks, turning abandoned quests into auto-wins? One can dream of epic achievements: ""Smith Slays the Quest Drought!"" But for now, it's a realm ripe for the taking. Who's first to grab that dusty scroll and make history? Your move, trailblazers! üèÜ

## Kill Chronicle: Peace Reigns, But Drama Lurks in the Shadows ‚öîÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏è

No blood spilled, no blades drawn ‚Äì our kill tallies read like a pacifist's diary. Zero player deaths, zero NPC takedowns, and nary a unique victim to mourn. Weapons? Gathering dust in sheaths. It's as if the fierce guardians like the hulking Gorefang Behemoth or sly Shadowstalker Assassins decided to take a coffee break. 

Yet, in this tranquil truce, tension simmers! Imagine the epic battles that *could* be: Smith, bot at his side, charging into a fray against a horde of rampaging Ironclad Golems, dodging enchanted arrows and swinging a legendary +5 Vorpal Blade. One wrong step, and it's a dramatic demise ‚Äì ""Hero Falls to Foe's Fury!"" But alas, no such spectacle this week. The lack of kills adds a comedic chill: Are we all too friendly, or just waiting for the bot to unleash automated anarchy? Picture the drama: A lone warrior versus the dreaded Void Wraith, only for the fight to fizzle into a staring contest. üòÇ Peace is golden, but a little action would spice up the stew!

## Wrapping the Scroll: From Snooze to Spectacle

In summary, Sentience slumbers under Smith's solitary spark. Economy idles, quests languish, kills evade ‚Äì but with the bot online, the winds of change whisper promises of prosperity and peril. Will fortunes flip? Quests conquer? Battles blaze? Only time (and you players) will tell. Stay vigilant, adventurers ‚Äì the Gazette will be watching!

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements (about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However, the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days, and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

‚Ä¢ During¬†plasmapheresis, blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do. Donor identification systems are in place to¬†track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by your¬†overall diet over several days, not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited, it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as it can dehydrate you.

5. No strenuous exercise for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure. Most centers recommend avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

7. If your pulse rate is above 100, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate, the box breathing technique may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to heal and repair your veins¬†via normal tissue healing.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what‚Äôs called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

‚Ä¢ Wait at least a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating to reduce bleeding and bruising risks.

‚Ä¢ You can use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased immunoglobulin levels.

‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein nutrients found in plasma.

‚Ä¢ Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess. Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, you must be healthy when you donate and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is highly encouraged for all donors.

It has ruined endless nights of sleep. Today I had a horrible haircut and bad experiences with the hair dresser so I have done endless research to see if I could find any bad reviews about her anywhere to see if I am not alone. When I had a bad dental consultation and the guy gave me a lot of anxiety, I did research to see if anyone else felt that way. I had a negative experience with the barista at a coffee shop, so I dive into reviews to try to find anything about her. The moment I find anything to confirm how I feel, I move on being able to feel like I am not alone. This obsessiveness can take days sometimes until I get an answer. I have been searching the internet to find even one person talk about the hair dresser for about 5 hours. It's almost 3:00am. 

Anyone else have this type of compulsion?

1odw9sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/picopresso/comments/1odw9sp/thoughts_on_the_minipresso_gr2_after_a_few_months/,Thoughts on the Minipresso GR2 after a few months - and I‚Äôd love input from Picopresso owners,"I've had the the Minipresso GR2 a few months now and I have some thoughts. I'd also love tips to make an even better brew, if anyone has any! 

First up: this thing makes incredible espressos. I'm amazed. Just as good as my friend's ‚Ç¨1000+ home machine that makes the coffee for him. The only thing better is an espresso from a high end machine that only coffee shops own (and presumably also a Picopresso, which I don‚Äôt have). Which considering this thing cost me ‚Ç¨60 and can be thrown in my bag, I'm just blown away. I haven't used my moka pot once since buying the Minipresso. My partner keeps laughing at me (kindly) because I won‚Äôt shut up about how good this thing is. 

More positives:
- Super lightweight and small. I can justify taking this travelling even when weight or space are an issue. 
- I love love love the tactile and mechanical experience of pumping my own espresso.
- I like the sustainability and cost benefit of how little coffee I use. Especially vs a moka pot or other methods like filter coffee.
- It self-tamps!

Now the not so good:
- It is easy to screw up by overfilling the coffee grinds. I now have this dialled in but it took a few mistakes to learn!
- The bottom section should have more grip to make it easier to unscrew.
- It does not dry easily, especially between the two rubber pieces and the pieces that go in them. To dry everything properly you have to take those apart. Meaning you now have 9 parts you have to take care of, which is very not handy when travelling. This also adds a lot of time to using the Minipresso. 
- Considering if you want to dry everything between uses you have to take everything apart, I‚Äôm worried about the longevity of the parts. For example with a moka pot you have to sometimes replace the rubber ring, but that‚Äôs it; the rest is absolutely bombproof because it‚Äôs all metal. On the Minipresso there‚Äôs much more that can wear out. Is this also the case with the Picopresso?
- Guesstimating how much coffee is needed is a recipe for suboptimal results. This is, after all, a portable unit; I‚Äôm not using weigh scales to measure my coffee.  I wish there was a line indicator to tell me to where I should fill the coffee. 


Things I'd like feedback on:
- I wish there was more water volume. I find myself making two 9g espressos for a cappuccino, in order to have enough coffee. Which, fine, I like the experience of making the coffee, but it'd be more convenient to make one coffee. One 12g espresso is of course stronger, but there's just not enough liquid to make a decent sized cappuccino or latte. Is this normal? Does the Picopresso produce more coffee liquid?
- Emptying the puck sucks. Especially when you're camping and trying to empty the grinds into a camp kitchen bin. And then you accidentally knock a little too hard and the whole puck plus bottom filter falls into the bin and you have to go bin fishing to pluck it out. Is there some good way to do this that doesn't risk losing the actual parts into the bin? And also doesn't involve curling your fingers over the edge so you don't lose the Minipresso parts into the bin but then you get coffee grounds over your fingers?
- should I be pre-tamping? I‚Äôm not even sure how I‚Äôd do it, considering a proper tamper doesn‚Äôt fit (not that I‚Äôd carry one around when travelling anyway). I started out tamping with a teaspoon but it seems to self-tamp fine. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd have better coffee if I did tamp, though. I‚Äôve seen in posts about the Picopresso that you guys tamp it hard. Is that also the case with the Minipresso?",1,1761201996.0,picopresso,0,1.0,False

As a backer of Meticulous and an intermittent Lance fan I think this might be beneficial for the Meticulous - e.g. it might lead to some exciting built-in profiles. However I am hesitant when it comes to the impartiality of Lance‚Äôs YouTube channel, funnily enough I think what I am most bummed out about is his coverage of the meticulous - however listening to his reasoning in the video above this is some sort of stamp of approval anyway. With that said I do understand the need to diversify income streams and put your knowledge to good use. Also I think Lance ‚Äùthinks out loud‚Äù about the ethics about this, and other ethical aspects of coffee YouTube.

1odw9ce,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1odw9ce/the_retired_address/,The retired address,"They arrived on a Monday‚Äîif ‚Äúarrived‚Äù is what you call appearing where there had been nothing. We came back from the store with bags of lemons and there they were: a man in a button-down on the lawn, a woman in a dress the color of good butter, two children chalking suns onto the cul-de-sac. The man waved with the hopeful awkwardness of first days. My wife, hip against the car door, waved back.

‚ÄúSomeone finally bought the Heron place,‚Äù she said‚ÄîHeron for the wading bird on the crooked mailbox, its beak forever tilted as if listening underground.

For months the circle at the end of our street had been a bracelet with a bead missing. Grass grew there in a tired, wet way; snow refused to stick; the air tasted faintly of pennies. Realtors staked signs and came back for them like fishermen checking empty hooks.

‚ÄúDrainage issues,‚Äù my wife said in her practical voice‚Äîthe voice that turns basements into stews and then lawsuits.

But on that Monday the empty lot was a house: gable roof, slate the color of a soft bruise, a dormer like a watching eye, clapboard pale as breath. A porch swing. Hydrangeas with unnatural poise, as if pinned by invisible hands.

On Tuesday we met them: Dane and Ellen; their children, Willa and Ash‚Äînames a little too carefully pressed. Willa had a backward F in chalk on her palm; Ash tucked his laces into his shoes. As we were saying nice-to-meet-yous, Willa pressed a chalk stub into my hand‚Äîserious, ceremonial. You notice these things about people you mean to like.

They were easy to like in a way that didn‚Äôt leave fingerprints. Dane laughed half a second early at jokes. Ellen produced a pie the way a magician drops a coin behind your ear‚Äîlight, sudden, impossible to refuse. The children drew suns, yes, but also doors without handles and roads that doubled back on themselves. Willa‚Äôs hands stayed strangely clean.

The porch smelled of lavender and‚Äîbeneath it‚Äîwet plaster.

That night I dreamed it rained on paper. The morning was bone dry.

On Wednesday our tiny HOA left a basket on their steps: grape jelly from Mrs. Hadley (across the way), vanilla sugar from Number Eight, and a plant with leaves like fat coins from us. By noon the basket was gone; at sunset it reappeared on our step with a note in a fine, patient hand: Thank you for acknowledging us. ‚ÄîE & D.

‚ÄúA little formal for a casserole note,‚Äù my wife said, smiling anyway. She set the plant on the table. Its leaves pressed back when I touched them, softly, like flesh.

That afternoon the mailman slid three postcards into our box, already worn as if read in weather. Two showed blue mountains and said Wish you were here. The third was blank except for an address, neat as stitches:

44 Heron Terrace, where the Heron place is.

I carried them over. Dane accepted the cards like something fragile. The blank one kept his eyes; his lips shaped a name I didn‚Äôt catch.

‚ÄúHow do you like the neighborhood?‚Äù he asked.

I said the liturgy: good for kids, safe, quiet.

He repeated the last word, pleased. ‚ÄúQuiet.‚Äù In the dim behind him someone hummed a lullaby I almost recognized. I had the sudden wish to step into their hall to see what the light would do to my skin.

We waved. They waved. We invited them for Sunday dinner; they declined with careful gratitude‚Äîsoon, when they were settled. Ash learned to ride in the cul-de-sac, legs pumping like a determined frog. The bike rounded once, then again‚Äîwith a decal I didn‚Äôt remember‚Äîand again. D√©j√† vu tilted my stomach.

On the eighth day they hung a wind chime that sounded unrelated to wind.

Other oddities were easy to misfile. Their lights were all on or all off. The hydrangeas never browned. Twice I watched Ellen carry groceries in; twice, distracted, I looked up to see her approaching the porch again with the same brown bags. I waved like repetition was a kind of weather.

‚ÄúDrainage,‚Äù my wife said when I told her. She was buried in a new project and not inclined toward what she called my nocturnes. ‚ÄúThis street‚Äôs a bowl. Weird things settle in bowls‚Äîhumidity pockets, local climate. Plants go mad. People repeat themselves. You‚Äôre seeing patterns because you‚Äôre bored.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not bored,‚Äù I said, and opened the fridge. The plant we‚Äôd given them‚Äîand they‚Äôd sent back‚Äîlooked out at me from the top shelf. I stood while the cold climbed my chest.

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù my wife said, and tipped the pot. Damp soil bled onto the glass. Something pale and jointed lay in it‚Äîa rootlet, or a small finger bone.

‚ÄúGross,‚Äù she said, laughing. I couldn‚Äôt persuade her we hadn‚Äôt put it there.

The following Monday‚Äîanother Monday, or the same one with a different face‚ÄîI went to the city records, because curiosity is a muscle that loves to tear. Mr. Phipps, the clerk, had hair like a struck match and the careful gaze of someone who knows where everything is and what loss costs.

‚ÄúHeron Terrace,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúForty-four.‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúNot an address. Lot designation only.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a house,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThere is not.‚Äù

He let me see the plat map. Our street ended in its candy circle. Our square held our names and mortgage record. Where forty-four should have been was a gray smear, a box drawn around absence. In faint pencil: retired address. Below: 1955‚Äîsix families, no trace. Do not reissue.

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù I asked. The room smelled like cooled ash.

‚ÄúIt means your neighbor doesn‚Äôt exist on paper,‚Äù he said gently. ‚ÄúAnd whatever you think you‚Äôre seeing is not a house.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a house,‚Äù I said, stupid as a child.

‚ÄúIt will want you to say that,‚Äù he said.

Walking home, the air had the salted feel of coming weather though the sky was clean. The Heron place was lit like a stage set the sun remembered too late. Ellen stood on the porch, smiling with a ruin‚Äôs patience. ‚ÄúCome by,‚Äù she called. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd love to have you.‚Äù She lifted a hand to adjust a strand at her crown and, for a blink, her fingers closed on air a little to the left of her.

I went in. Of course I did.

A stranger‚Äôs hallway has no right to feel right. Fresh paint. A rug from a childhood I didn‚Äôt have. Corners offering their throats like good dogs. In the living room the furniture had the stagy stillness of houses you can‚Äôt afford‚Äînothing worn where it should be. Over the mantel hung an oil portrait. The faces were precise; the bodies arrived at their edges with confidence. The eyes were wrong, as if remembering other faces.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt photograph well,‚Äù Ellen said without having entered, the way memory enters. ‚ÄúThe painter had to come every day. He could see us only here. When he left, the canvas went empty. He said the worst wasn‚Äôt the emptiness. It was how the canvas remembered where we had been.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you hear yourself?‚Äù I asked, before I could stop.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said, touching her temple as if to hold a headache still. ‚ÄúWe try to sound normal for as long as it‚Äôs useful.‚Äù

‚ÄúUseful,‚Äù I repeated.

She gave me a glass of water I hadn‚Äôt seen her pour‚Äîperfectly cold, perfectly tasteless. I couldn‚Äôt drink it. The surface moved as if someone else breathed near it.

‚ÄúWe need witnesses,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúA place is a hole until someone looks. A person is a hole until someone says their name.‚Äù

‚ÄúDane,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWilla. Ash.‚Äù

Her mouth trembled. ‚ÄúThose aren‚Äôt our names. We were given them. They will do.‚Äù

The house‚Äôs angles were wrong. The hallway narrowed then widened like a throat. Doorways were the size of doorways but you had to turn sideways to pass. The fridge hummed but there was no food. The pantry held jars the color of spinal fluid. In one, what looked like a sugared flower stood upright‚Äîmore bone than blossom.

Willa appeared with the gravity of a child carrying a secret. She placed another drawing in my hand: four figures, a sun, a house with a face; the heads were blank ovals. ‚ÄúSo you remember,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou remember better than anyone.‚Äù Her eyes were bright and very dry.

‚ÄúRemember what?‚Äù The chalk stub she‚Äôd given me warmed in my pocket.

‚ÄúThat we were here,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat we get to be somewhere.‚Äù

When I left, the outside air slapped me with its simplicity. My wife was on our porch, reading with the expression she saves for numbers that won‚Äôt heel.

‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNext door.‚Äù

Her face went wary. ‚ÄúAt the Hadleys‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúAt forty-four.‚Äù

She looked past me at the house that stood there, gorgeous as an excuse. ‚ÄúRight,‚Äù she said, careful.

We didn‚Äôt speak of them that night. We ate pasta. On TV, a handsome person saved another in a parking garage with a speech. At the sink, my glass left a wet ring shaped like a zero.

The family next door began to lean. That‚Äôs the only word. Our house felt their weight, room to room, as if houses could talk and one was tired. I woke to the lullaby I‚Äôd almost recognized and realized it was insurance hold music. The posters in our home office‚ÄîSOLVE FOR X! YOU‚ÄôRE CLOSER THAN YOU THINK!‚Äîtilted toward the Heron place. A note slipped under our door:

We don‚Äôt last long without attention. The wind unbuttons us. The days forget us. Please come by. Bring your wife. She is good at looking.

My wife begged off with a headache. On a call, I heard her say her name and then, flat, ‚ÄúI work here.‚Äù She emerged thinner by a degree you shouldn‚Äôt notice in a day.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve lost my payroll,‚Äù she said, brittle. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on too many lists and not enough at once.‚Äù

The next morning, new photos on our mantel: us beside a lake I didn‚Äôt remember; my wife with a blue blanket like a wave; our wedding picture where she looked like the sketch of herself‚Äîexquisite, feathery. I wasn‚Äôt there. The absence had more muscle than presence. It ate.

On Thursday her badge was gone. ‚ÄúI must have left it,‚Äù she said, fingertips rubbing the counter where it should be. ‚ÄúWhy does everything feel like I‚Äôm remembering it wrong?‚Äù

Because you are, I thought. Because they‚Äôre lining their nest with us.

The storm came that night. The next-door house flickered like a house seen through moving water. The family stood at their window, still as fruit. Willa lifted her hand. Blue marked her palm, the backward F. The porch swing bucked like something trying to fling itself from a dream.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going over,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù my wife said with her whole voice. ‚ÄúLet the storm look at them.‚Äù

But I was already in my coat. The lining felt subtly wrong, as if my arms remembered another interior. On their porch the air bellowed. Inside, the storm went quiet‚Äîas if I‚Äôd stepped into a pocket sewn inside a larger sound.

The house had become my house. My rug. My chair with the torn seam. My wife‚Äôs tulip-necked vase. Over the mantel, an oil portrait of a family. The faces were meticulous. The bodies had conviction. The eyes were mine.

‚ÄúIs this a joke?‚Äù I whispered, afraid to wake something.

Dane and Ellen sat at our table in my chairs. Dane‚Äôs hands wrapped nothing. Ellen smiled. ‚ÄúWe tried to make it feel familiar,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe journey‚Äôs easier.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat journey?‚Äù

‚ÄúInto the space that holds.‚Äù Her voice broke and knit itself. ‚ÄúDo you know what it is to be a rumor of a family? To be kept by children‚Äôs memory and municipal error? To push at the outline until you wonder if there‚Äôs anything beyond to push into?‚Äù She touched my wrist with a hand very cold. ‚ÄúYou anchor us when you look. But if we keep you standing on the cliff for us, eventually the cliff is you.‚Äù

Willa slid from under the table like a fox. She set her head against my thigh. Rain lived in her hair and cellar in her bones. ‚ÄúPlease keep us here,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNo one else sees us long enough to make us heavy.‚Äù

The room tilted. Gravity reached for me the way water reaches for the shape of a cup. My name felt like an object I could set down. ‚ÄúI need to go,‚Äù I said, and turned toward the door‚Äîand found a mirror. In it, my wife stood in our real house, calling my name, a small pale bird where her name had been. Behind her, the room brightened and dimmed. I put my palm to the glass. Cold. Beneath it, wind.

Ellen‚Äôs voice came close. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry. We made a thing out of being seen, and now it‚Äôs too late to be something else.‚Äù Her fingers found my sleeve and met only the suggestion of me. ‚ÄúYou are easy to love. That‚Äôs not your fault.‚Äù

Fury can be a raft. I knocked the painting from the mantel. It landed like a breath. The wrong things are safe, here; the canvas didn‚Äôt break. When it slid, the faces blurred where my hand had touched, oil remembering it had once been liquid. Underneath lay a folded paper in that fine, patient hand:
	1955.	Try again.
	1956.	Try again.

Then our names. Try again.

In my version I stepped through the glass into my wife‚Äôs hands, and the glass became a door. In theirs, perhaps, I sat and ate the pie.

After that we practiced not-looking. We brushed our teeth facing the mirror with our eyes closed. On the porch we grew plants so tall they argued with the view. I named every house-sound‚Äîthe oven‚Äôs tick as it cooled, the mutter in the ducts when the air kicked on‚Äîand decided none belonged to them.

We did not look. The wind unbuttoned them. The days forgot them. At last the hydrangeas browned and fell at once, a small audience losing faith.

One morning the curtains opened on an empty lot, wet to the knees with dew. The heron on the mailbox still leaned, listening to the ground. A rectangle of earth where the porch had been held the pallor of skin kept too long under a bandage. I stood there and could not think of a prayer that wasn‚Äôt a throat-clearing.

Neighbors, pressed, would say no one lived there in our time. Mrs. Hadley laughed to keep from crying. ‚ÄúThe city retired that address years ago,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMy sister knows the clerk.‚Äù She gave me the look reserved for people who shouldn‚Äôt be driving. ‚ÄúMaybe take a break from late nights.‚Äù

My wife brought home a new badge with her name and something like a title. She found the coffee maker in a cupboard none of our cupboards had ever had. She looked rested, the way a field looks rested after the cows move on.

‚ÄúThe neighbors?‚Äù I asked. She turned a heavy wheel inside herself.

‚ÄúHeron Terrace never had a forty-four,‚Äù she said.

We sold in spring‚Äîshorter commute, better arts program, the usual fictions‚Äîand left on a Monday. Moving day makes ghosts of everything: chairs that knew your hips become strangers, your mug becomes someone else‚Äôs. When the truck was loaded I stood in the street and said goodbye to nothing in particular, which is also a way to pray.

At a light, leaving town, I glanced down a side street and saw a house with a watching dormer and hydrangeas that didn‚Äôt brown. That‚Äôs absence‚Äôs trick: once you‚Äôve made a home of it, you can find it anywhere.

Our new place is a thin house with good bones. One neighbor is a retired teacher who keeps maps of places she hasn‚Äôt visited under her bed; the other is a young couple who argue gamely about whether their dog is a person. We drank coffee on the porch and, for a while, felt like people in a painting that survived a flood. The air smelled of pine and a distant, institutional lemon.

Halfway through my second cup I saw chalk on the sidewalk: a long gray road that doubled back, a door without a handle. When I touched it, it left nothing at all. Finally, I told myself. Children who play outside. I looked up. Across the street a woman in a butter-colored dress lifted her hand. A boy crouched, careful with his laces. A girl watched me with dry, bright eyes, a backward letter marked on her palm.

I looked away‚Äîthe stubborn trick an animal knows for survival. I watched an ant climb the rail. I studied the grain in the step until it braided and unbraided. I named my wife out loud and again, tighter, like a seat belt. Wind moved through the street and made a sound that did not belong to wind. I did not look. If I look, I will become a cliff again, and they will be saved by my edges until I crumble into their land.

We puncture our lives with mirrors and windows for reasons that aren‚Äôt moral or fair. I‚Äôm writing this because writing is a way of looking without looking; because forgetting is an appetite, and sometimes it‚Äôs ours, and sometimes it belongs to whatever waits on the porch beyond our mercy, ready to be acknowledged into flesh.

Go to the clerk‚Äôs office and you may meet a man with red hair who knows where everything is. Ask to see the plat map. He will show you a gray smear where a house should be. Do not put your finger in it.

If a basket appears with a plant you recognize and a note in a patient hand‚Äîif a family arrives in the teeth of a Monday and your empty street suddenly feels complete‚Äîbe kind. Be kind from a distance that does not exist in love. Wave, hard, until your arm aches. Then go inside. Cut your lemons. And do not, under any circumstances, say their names.

Because the bitter core is this: the family next door never existed‚Äîuntil we said they did.

And we are so very good at saying.",2,1761201949.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1odw8xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1odw8xp/skins_analogy_in_2_parts/,Skins Analogy in 2 parts,"Alright. I'll keep this expression simple. 

I do not like EA adding multi-player skins, especially tasteless ones. 

I will simply use this analogy: 

I have decided to go to the EA restaurant to order a meal. I decided to order their steak from the menu, which describes that it is a well cooked, well seasoned steak. A classic, but of excellent quality. Nothing abstract or obtuse about it. The waiter insures me that it does not have rainbow sprinkles on it. That it is, a fantastic traditional steak, like they used to make em. 

Perfect. That sounds delicious. I don't know why, but all the other restaurants around have started to add rainbow sprinkles to most of their menu items. Apparently people are paying to add their own sprinkle. Weird. It's made eating out frustrating, I won't even eat most places these days. I don't want rainbow sprinkles on my fries, my sandwich, or my coffee. Some items I do like sprinkles on them, like ice cream and cake, but not on my sausages.

The waiter takes my payment, which due to the cost of food going up, costs me more than I am typically willing to pay for a steak. I haven't enjoyed a good steak in a few years, there just ain't that many which arn't covered in sprinkles these days.

The waiter then leaves to place my order with the chef. The chefs of a lot of these high end restaurants put a lot of effort into their art, but it must be a frustrating job these days, considering how often the managers are getting the rest of the staff to add sprinkles to every meal. 

I sit and ponder about the ethics of me eating in a restaurant recently purchased by Saudi Arabia and Jared Kushner, but I don't ponder on it too long, it seems more like an unreal abstract concept when compared for my hunger. Besides, I've already purchased my meal. 

The waiter comes back with the steak. It looks too good to be true. I take my first bite, and it's really fucking good. I begin to chow into it. I nearly cry. This steak reminds me of the previous steaks I greatly enjoyed, when I was younger. The sort of steak that reminds me of better times, going back... good lord, has it been nearly 8 years since my last good steak? but somehow this one is even better than the ones of the past. It brings me back to the good ol' days, where you got what you paid for at a restaurant. A quality meal made with love from the chef, unmolested by sprinkles. This is damn good steak, exactly as I ordered. 

After the first few bites, the waiter comes back to me. He asks ""How's the food?"". I swallow my bite, and respond ""This is amazing. Thank you for such a delicious traditional steak. I am greatly enjoying it, and will leave you a glowing review. I will recommend to my steak loving friends that we should come to EA and have a delicious meal sometime. Thank you for making such a fine meal, and told me that there would be no sprinkles"". 

The waiter nods, as if he expected this exact compliment. The waiter knows how good this steak was, it was marketed after all to be the exact steak I wanted. 

""Good"" he responds. ""Well now that you've enjoyed the first few bites, here's something extra""
He reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a hand-full of multi-colored dash lines. Fucking rainbow sprinkles. 

My jaw drops, I say ""Wait. What are you doing? You told me there wasn't any sprinkles!""

The waiter steers, it seems obvious that he wasn't ever there to ensure I had a good experience in the restaurant, no, it seems instead that he was there to get me to order the steak in the first place. 
Through gritted teeth he says ""There wasn't any sprinkles. Now there are"". 

He drops his hand full of sprinkles onto the steak. The sprinkles begin to bleed their dyes across the juicy steak, as the heat of the warm meal melts it down to sticky goo. The steak, immediately, is fouled. 

I stare at the steak for a few moments, mouth agape. I turn my head back to the waiter, and through half-anger, half sadness I exclaim ""but I didn't want sprinkles on my steak. You said there wasn't sprinkles!""

""There WASN'T sprinkles, but we just started to offer customers the ability to add their own colored sprinkle to everyone's meals here in the restaurant. There is no charge to you, unless you want to add your own sprinkle to everyone else's meal. You get to choose the color. They cost a 6th of the price of the steak, each"". 

I look around. Several people are eating the same steak, but covered in sprinkles. They look joyous, blissful even. They seem to be -enjoying- their meal. I see a young boy excitedly ask his father if he can add his own sprinkle to his and everyone's meal. ""Please daddy!? Please please please! I want to have a red one!""
His dad gives in. He knows it's a lot of money for a sprinkle, but hey, it keeps the kid happy.

I'm baffled. Do any of these people have a sense of taste? Or have they literally never had a good steak without sprinkles? I mean... maybe they're completely ignorant of what a proper steak even is? Are sprinkles so normalized for these folk that they don't understand what any of these meals used to be? Coherent, delicious, expertly crafted meals with delicate palettes, designed with care and attention to achieve a specific tasteful experience? Maybe I'm getting old, most these people don't look like they could tell you where they were during 9/11, because they didn't even exist yet. 

I hear the chef swearing in the back kitchen. I haven't heard language like that in awhile. Apparently he's just put in a 20 hour shift. 
I see the kitchen door fly open, and the chef walks out in a furious passion. His throws his hat and apron in the air, and screams ""I'M GOING TO START MY OWN RESTAURANT. I'M A 5 STAR CHEF, AND YOU RUIN EVERYTHING I MAKE WITH FUCKING SPRINKLES"". 
He is very clearly a passionate artist of food, who pours his heart and soul into every meal he makes. It's no wonder the steak was so good...

I turn back towards the waiter. He nudges me to take a bite of the glittery colorful mess of a steak. ""The meat is still juicy, and everything you enjoyed about it is still there"" he says. ""Are you sure you don't want to add your own sprinkle? This green one is on the hourly mega sale! only 6$ for another 19 minutes and 57 seconds""

I blink a few times. I am bewildered, and mentally I am exploring the awful question of if DEVO was right. Maybe we are devolving as a society. 
""I want the steak I paid for, it was a good steak. I don't want sprinkles on my steak. You told me the steak had no sprinkles.""

The waiter raises his nose upwards and looks down upon me. His demeanour sours quickly as he realizes I won't be purchasing my own sprinkle. 
""The steak -didn't- have any sprinkles. Now it does."" he sayscoldly. He then briskly walks away towards the kitchen. 

At this point, one of the young fellows behind me gets out of his seat. He stands over my shoulder, and speaks loud enough for the room to hear. ""Dude. What did you expect? EA has to offer sprinkles to make more money. How else would we get the side pieces?""

At that point, the waiter comes back with two plates. One plate is full of top quality fries, the most appetizing and artistic fries I have ever laid eyes upon. The other plate is covered with a lid and locked with a chain around it. Atop of it is a note that says ""TO unlock this special sprinkle, eat 10 fries with your butterknife""

""Here is your updated meal, sir"" he hisses, then reaches into his pockets to grab another smattering of sprinkles that he releases onto the fries and steak. He adds yet another layer, this time of sprinkles with different shapes.

 I quiver and let out a silent ""but I didn't order these. I just want my steak, without the sprinkles.""

The dude, visibly upset at my dislike for the sprinkled food, gets loud. ""DUDE. THEY'RE UPDATING YOUR MEAL FOR FREE. YOU'RE GETTING THIS BECAUSE EVERYONE PAID FOR SPRINKLES. IT'S HOW THE RESTAURANT WORKS NOW. WHAT'S WRONG WITH SPRINKLES BRO? THEY MAKE PEOPLE SMILE. WHO ARE YOU TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO SPEND THEIR MONEY ON?"". 

The dude's voice violently shakes my skull. I wasn't expecting such an energetic defense over my desire for the normal meal that I ordered. I am so confused. They gave me such a good steak. What is even going on? 

Foolishly, I respond to the dude.

I mean, I had some idea. He was using 2 different filters on my computer, along with software that took snapshots of what I was doing every 5 minutes. He also had the ability to remotely access my computer.

I was the black sheep. I got horrible grades, which led to my parents comparing me to my younger sibling‚Äîwho was the exact opposite. Straight A's, a bunch of extracurricular activities, the model child. The fact that I was The oldest was icing on the cake. Instead of being an example, I was a failure. 

I think part of it was the fact that I wasn't a trophy child. I dropped out of college after my first year, then got a job at a call center after some time, where I worked until I able to move away.

When he found out that I'm gay, my dad said a bunch of nasty shit. Things like ""you're being deceived by the Devil and evil men"" . After, he would make passive aggressive remarks like ""you should go to a singles ward activity and get to know some girls,"" emphasizing the last word with some venom.

He threatened to kick me out of the house (after I turned 18) if I didn't go to church.

1odw30z,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpain/comments/1odw30z/so_i_finally_tried_medical_cannabis_for_my/,So i finally tried medical cannabis for my chronic back pain (UK) - wasn't expecting this,"Right so... bit of backstory here. Ive been dealing with lower back pain for about 4 years now (herniated disc L4-L5 if anyone's curious). Tried physio, tried those useless back support belts,tried every painkiller under the sun. Nothing really worked long-term, and honestly the side effects from codeine were making me feel worse than the actual pain sometimes (anyone else get that?)

Anyway, couple months ago Im scrolling through posts here at like 2am cause I cant sleep (surprise surprise, back pain keeping me awake again). Someone mentioned they'd been looking into CBD products and I thought ""yeah right,another snake oil thing"" but then I kept seeing more people talk about it. So I did what any desperate person does ‚Äì started googling at 3am.

Thats when I found Releaf worldwide. At first I was super skeptical cause you know how it is,everything online claims to cure everything. But then I read it was actual medical prescriptions, prescribed by real doctors. And I figured... whats the worst that can happen? Waste another hundred quid on something that doesnt work? Been there done that with chiropractors lol

Booked a consultation (they refund you if your not eligible which gave me some confidence tbh). Had a video call with a specialist who actually seemed to give a shit about my medical history ‚Äì asked about previous treatments, MRI results, pain levels, the whole nine yards. Two weeks later I got prescribed CBD oil (15% concentration) and some low-THC flower for nighttime use.

Now heres where it gets interesting.First week or so? Honestly didnt notice much.I was like ""great another thing that doesnt work"" but the doc said give it 3-4 weeks to really kick in properly. Around week three I realized something weird ‚Äì I'd been sitting at my desk for like 2 hours without that usual stabbing pain in my lower back. You know that pain where you have to stand up and stretch every 20mins? Yeah,that wasnt there.

Its been about 10 weeks now and honestly the difference is massive. Im not saying the pains completely gone (lets be real, herniated discs dont just magically heal) but the intensity has dropped from like 7-8/10 on most days to maybe 3-4/10. I can actually do normal things again ‚Äì grocery shopping without wanting to die halfway through, playing with my kids without being useless the next day, sleeping through the night (!!!).

The CBD oil I take in the morning (about 0.3ml under the tongue) and it helps with inflammation throughout the day.The flower I use at night helps me actually sleep properly, which honestly might be half the reason Im feeling better - your body needs rest to heal right?

Few things nobody tells you tho:

* Finding the right dosage takes time (dont expect instant results)
* Its not cheap but compared to private physio sessions its actually reasonable
* You get a medical cannabis card which is weirdly reassuring (even tho its legal you still feel a bit paranoid at first lol)
* Some products work better than others,its trial and error

I know everyones different and what works for me might not work for you.But if youve tried everything else and your still struggling, might be worth looking into? Just make sure its done properly through actual medical channels not some random website selling ""miracle CBD"".

Anyone else here tried this route for back pain?Would love to hear if it helped you too or if im just lucky

1odw0u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/trauma/comments/1odw0u4/the_night_my_stepdad_physically_abused_my_mom_and/,The night my stepdad physically abused my mom and I,"I‚Äôm a 22 female,living with my parents until I can figure out where I‚Äôm going In life and get my own place. One night ,a few months ago,(the memory of the whole thing still fresh in my mind)My stepdad got REALLY drunk and started getting mad for no reason or over minor things. At one point he tried going for my baby  sister ,who was in my arms, and I put my hand out to silently say,‚ÄùThat‚Äôs not a good idea right now‚Äù,and he grabbed me and pushed me into the couch,causing me to lose my grip on my sister, and drop her on the ground. My mom called his brother ,and asked for help and he came over. When he came ,he didn‚Äôt want to help my mom,or my sister or even me. He came into the house with accusations against us,saying we were being the problem and taking his big brother‚Äôs side and how ‚Äúmy mom and I will go to prison‚Äù. He started pulling out his phone and recording the situation to try to use against us,while I tried to get the phone out of his hand. He pushed me back. My mom got mad and started screaming at him for putting his hands on me,and my stepdad grabbed her,and threw her over a chair bent over,and started hitting her. I sprung up with adrenaline and started punching my stepdad,and he grabbed me and threw my body up against the wall and started squeezing me tightly. I was screaming for help,while my stepdad dad‚Äôs brother was behind him,filming it on his phone,yelling ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to jail (legal name)‚Äù. I finally grabbed my stepdad by the throat,and he lost his grip and let go of me. Mom grabbed the baby and ran out the back gate into the alley. I was following closely behind,with only socks on(wasted no time,and didn‚Äôt even care about shoes). Mom,baby and i ran across the street to the park and sat in the grass behind some bushes to catch our breath. I was crying hysterically and could barely speak,hyperventilating. Meanwhile our pitbulls, Brusier and Tazzy ,went out the back gate with us and sat with us. We sat there for around 10 minutes before mom decided to see if Stepdad and his brother left,and asked me to stay with the baby,to see if she could get the car. 3-5 minutes later mom has the car and me and the baby and the dogs got in the car. I put my sister in her car seat and told mom to just drive while I strapped her in. Mom drove slowly and then sped up once I told her baby was strapped. We went back to the house to put the dogs inside. I remember when mom went into the house,I sent a voice message to my friends in a group chat, could barely tell them what happened because I was in shock,I was hysterical, and it took me a few tries to finally say what happened. Mom came back and we drove off again. We just drove. Not knowing  where we were going to go. We realized Stepdad had the credit cards and moms wallet with him,so mom drove to his mom‚Äôs house to try and get them back,and I stayed in the car with the baby and I could hear yelling and screaming. Mom finally ran to the car with her wallet that he took,and his mom started chasing after her,and started yelling and screaming at us that she was going to call the police as we drove away. After driving for a while,we  finally got hungry and went ihop at around 12 am,and then went back home,because he wasn‚Äôt there. I remember walking into the house and seeing the destruction that was caused. The coffee table knocked over,toys all over the place,a mark on the wall,where dad had me held. I remember that night,when the adrenaline wore off,I was in so much pain. My entire body burned and I was scared he injured my back that was already messed up from having scoliosis. I went to work the next day and it took all my courage to not cry and breakdown. He still lives in the house with us. I wanted mom to say ‚Äúpack up,we aren‚Äôt coming back ‚Äú. We had no where to go,and I work as a carhop ,so I didn‚Äôt have that much money,and she didn‚Äôt want to leave my other sister that lives with her dad. If we drove off with the car and ran away,the car would be reported as stolen because it was under my stepdad‚Äôs mother‚Äôs name. The cops would come for us. So we stayed unfortunately‚Ä¶  
After the situation,a few days later,stepdad kept complaining how ‚ÄúI left scratches on his neck. The scratch‚Äôs were small and barely noticeable and the not even the length of my pinky (and I have small pinkies) meanwhile mom has bruises on her body,and I had bruises on my arms,and my ribs,and my back from being squeezed and pressed against the wall.

I know people on here are going to say‚Äù it would have been safer to drive,and risk the cops coming for us for a ‚Äústolen vehicle‚Äù and just explain what happened ‚Äú. Thats what I wanted to do. Unfortunately it wasn‚Äôt up to me. It was up to my mom. I don‚Äôt have a license so I couldn‚Äôt drive us, and risk getting pulled over and ticketed for not having a license,and possibly arrested for driving ‚Äúa stolen vehicle ‚Äú. 
 
Or that I know people will say‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt safe in the house with him‚Äù. I know we aren‚Äôt and if It was my decision, I‚Äôd have my mom pack her things,and the baby‚Äôs and I‚Äôd pack mine and we‚Äôd go. I can‚Äôt force my mom to do something she doesn‚Äôt want to do. He pays for everything,and we only stick with him to survive‚Ä¶

It sucks that we have to stay with an abuser because that‚Äôs the only way we‚Äôd survive. My mom is disabled and doesn‚Äôt work ,and getting on disability income in our state is nearly impossible. We get disability checks for my baby sister because she was born premature and has down syndrome,but even that little bit of money, wouldn‚Äôt be enough to survive. My paycheck isn‚Äôt even enough to survive. We‚Äôre stuck unfortunately.

What a way to start, but I am pretty terrible at intro and talking about myself. Regardless of that I am going to try! 

I am up for gaming, talking, being weird‚Ä¶. Which I am really good at. I have been trying to do some weird photos when I am out and about, since I am trying to travel a bit more here and there. I work from home so I am usually around more than I am not. I am also a bit in the spicy brain side, which just means yay for ADHD, anxiety, depression, and honestly who knows what else is going on in there. 

I am an avid coffee and caffeine consumer, fan of all things space and sci-fi, and lover of most food (especially tacos, hell yes tacos). I have been gaming a bit more recently, mostly in Fallout and some of the more chill games. I am not against some others though. 

I do enjoy space and sci-fi as well. I like tv and movies as must of us do, but I tend to gravitate towards things I constantly watch over and over again. That‚Äôs the ADHD in the brain.
