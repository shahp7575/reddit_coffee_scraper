1kyv417,https://www.reddit.com/r/tattooadvice/comments/1kyv417/frustrated_by_excessive_bleeding_during_sessions/,Frustrated by excessive bleeding during sessions,"I am having a large coverup done on my back. The original tattoo is over a decade old. Yesterday was my 3rd session in the last 6 weeks. And for the 3rd time we had to stop after 90 minutes because I started bleeding so heavily that it was pushing the ink back out. I am also bleeding quite a lot after sessions. I can't have the saniderm bandage on my tattoo because within a couple hours it just fills completely up like a big bag of blood and starts running down my back. (Plus I don't seem to react well to the adhesive).

I am getting frustrated because I am having to go in every couple weeks for these super short sessions and I was really hoping to have this piece done before the summer.  As it stands now I have only about 1/2 of the work done at most with a bunch of empty outline.

I'm not having any issues with healing other than some small areas of patchiness from the bleeding. 

My artist does not have a heavy hand, she's not slicing me or overworking any areas. I have been getting tattooed on and off since I was 16 without any issue although this is my first big piece in over a decade.

I don't drink or smoke. I consume cannabis but not on the day of tattoos. I only drink 1 cup of coffee a day. I am a woman in my late 40s, maybe that's a factor?

Any thoughts or advice?

TLDR: I'm bleeding heavily during tattoo sessions and it's interfering with my ability to get a much anticipated and wanted piece finished.",1,1748578427.0,tattooadvice,0,1.0,False

I will graduate in two years with my B.A. in Forensic Psychology and Cross-Sector Leadership Certificate from Barrett, ASU. By the time I graduate, I will have:

\- at least six-eight internships ranging rom non-profit, to education, to legal, to law enforcement. 

\- been a research assistant

\- been a teaching assistant

I am also  in some prestigious clubs: Mock Trial and Next Generation Service Corp. 

I am interning abroad next summer, and then studying abroad in Singapore next fall (then coming back to AZ to graduate lol). 

i am starting to study for my LSAT now, but am aiming for a 165-172. i know this is low, but hopefully i do better than that bc ill be working my butt off studying. 

i have also hosted three fundraiser events, have been a manager at various restaurants for three years, and will hopefully accomplish more by the time i graduate. 

heres the catch: my GPA is so cooked. right now its 3.4 (YIKES I KNOW). im also enrolled at two colleges so at the other one my GPA is prob like 3.0 (YIKES I KNOW). but by the time i graduate, im hoping i can get that gpa at least up to a 3.6, at best to a 3.8 or 3.9. at the other college, the best i can get it is maybe a 3.5. 

any advice for overcoming my obvious shortcomings? some things im thinking of pursuing to continue strengthening my resume and self are opening my own coffee shop business, writing a book and publishing it, participating in various hobbies (swimming, horse-riding, rock-climbing, scuba diving, surfing, ect) to just grow thats not rly related i guess, and solo traveling (also not rly related but i think everything contributes to who i am). i also can write very well and am compelling and have a moving story, so i think my personal statement and letters of recommendation will be good.

Life’s been pretty routine—wake up, coffee, work, chill with my cat—but this gnawing sensation lingers. Could be something about relationships, or maybe it's just my mind playing tricks on me. I don’t know if anyone else gets this way, like a premonition that doesn't bother to give you the details? Makes me question if I’m overthinking or if there's really something I need to prepare for.

Maybe it's a cue to slow down and check in with myself. Or maybe it's just life being life, kinda messy and unpredictable. Guess I’m just hoping that writing this into the void might lighten the weight a bit.

**AITA for arranging potluck for my sister's Apology Dinner?**

**MOOD SPOILER:** >!Weird!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/5B8tHmXESM)  **Apr 29, 2021**

*^(I remembered about this after reading about another poster's Apology Dinner.)*

So my mom decided to host an Apology Dinner for my older sister.

As my mom was busy writing her apology and whatnot, she asked if I would take care of the food and beverages. 

I said sure, thinking it was just for my family of 4... But when my Aunt and Cousins heard, they also wanted to attend, so I decided to make it a pot luck. (Pot luck is where all the adult guests bring a dish, and all the dishes are shared.)

Of course, I never asked my sister to bring any food because she was the guest of honor. 

Well, everyone came over and we are all excited to listen to the apology and eat.

My sister was among the last to arrive, and she was offended that we were serving pot luck for her special dinner. 

I explained that I had carefully planned what would be served (sister's boyfriend is a vegetarian, so we had two meatless options).

But my sister yelled at me that the Apology Meal should be prepared (or at least paid for) by the apologizer (my mom) in order to show proper atonement. 

We went forward with the Apology Dinner, but my sister call me the Asshole for undermining the apology.

**[deleted]**

>INFO: what the actual fuck is an Apology Dinner?

**OOP**

>>It where someone apologizes to another person in front of the whole family.

**Funky-Spunkmeyer**

>>>You took the time to explain a potluck (something I’ve known about since before I can remember) but just assumed everyone would know what an “apology dinner” is - despite most of us only hearing of it right here, right now. 

>>>YTA for that, I don’t care about anything else. 

>>>INFO- where on earth do you live?

**OOP**

>>>>From Northern Dobruja, but we live in the States

**Editors Note: Northern Dobruja is in Romania near the Black Sea and Bulgaria**

**TheMaskedHamster**

>I am really eager to know the answer to the question you posed, but I'm afraid none other than others from the same region who share the tradition could provide a proper answer.

>But based on what you've said, it's not you who would be at fault, but your mother for asking you in the first place.  She might be upset that you went along with your mother's request, but that you made it a potluck seems irrelevant except perhaps that you involved other people in helping your mother avoid a responsibility.  

>I am curious as to whether you are familiar with this tradition being practiced outside of northern Dobruja.  This has gained a lot of internet awareness, and knowing could be helpful for intercultural communication.

**OOP**

>>I think it would be practiced, but not so formally.

>>Like if you had 2 good friends who were in an argument.

>>One of them might invite the other one to coffee to apologize (or ""hash things out""). The initiator should pay. 

>>Maybe you would go to help mediate. 

>>Because the thing is that when most people apologize, they don't really mean it that much. So it's a good to have a friend or family member there to make sure the apology is sincere, and the apologizer ""gets it."" Otherwise, they would say something like, ""Sorry you took it the wrong way.""

**cinderparty**

>>>But why would you do that *in front of* other people?!?

>>>I could not fathom this, I don’t even like getting gifts because it makes me too much the center of attention.  I would hate this if I was the one apologizing or the one being apologized too.

**OOP**

>>>>To help mediate as needed. Celebrate the closure. And such.

**~**

**7thatsanope**

>An apology dinner just sounds absurd. But, aside from that…

>If the person apologizing is supposed to be responsible for the food (which if you’re going to make a whole meal ordeal out of an apology only makes sense), then why TF is your sister mad at you? It’s your mother’s apology so it’s her responsibility, not yours. You’re just an innocent bystander whose mom pawned off the responsibility to. It sounds like both your mom and your sister owe *you* an apology dinner for this nonsense.

>NTA

**OOP**

>>I think it's like in American culture. Let's say a husband wants to apologize to his wife. So he gives her flowers. But then she finds out that his brother went to the the florist. So she's mad that he didn't pick out the flowers himself.

>>I also think there's something in American culture where you are not supposed to arrange your own birthday party???

**7thatsanope**

>>>That makes sense and is along the lines of what I was thinking and why it’s your mom your sister should be mad at about the food, not you.

**OOP**

>>>>It's mainly because there's one particular restaurant that we order from. If I had ordered from there, I would have used my mom's credit card to pay. But since I made it a potluck, then there wasn't any monetary cost.

**diagnosedwolf**

>>>>>But that still doesn’t explain why she’s mad at you and not your mother.

>>>>>In your flower example, you get mad at the husband, not the brother.

>>>>>In your apology dinner, your mother should have made the effort and didn’t.  So why isn’t your sister angry at *her*?   Why is she angry at you instead?

**AnnaLirra**

>>>>>>I’m guessing here... sister maybe thinks OP shouldn’t have gotten involved. By doing so, and making it potluck instead of how it should have been with more effort or cost to mom, OP is taking moms side. 

>>>>>>I don’t agree, but I can see how one might view OP making it a potluck as “undermining” the event.

**~**

**Ote77**

>NTA. But I am curious on what your mum did that ended in an apology dinner.

**OOP**

>>Tried to breakup sister and her boyfriend for no good reason (his ethnicity)

**Tough-Refridgerator95**

>>>Amazing. Imagine thinking a potluck dinner will fix being a bigot.

• https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/apology-dinner-reddit-sorry-b1840311.html

Yesterday in the wee hours, I posted about my family's Apology Dinner TM in r/AmITheAsshole.

When I woke up, I got only like ten replies, but it was reposted on an independent twitter account dedicated to the sub.

A couple media outlets started reaching out to me, so I posted an update noting that I was being interviewed, but the mods didn't believe that a post with only 150ish upvotes was getting media attention, so they deleted the whole thing.

But meanwhile, it trended all the way to #1 on Twitter. I started getting calls from some friends and relatives, because they recognized the region that my family is originally from (N Dobruja) in the comments.

Now all the adult family members are taking credit for the Apology Dinner TM concept. (I thought it was a regional thing, and that the term ""Apology Dinner"" was self-explanatory, but whatever.)

Anyway, my uncle says he was the first one to hold an Apology Meal. My mom says that it was more of a snack (tea & crackers) and she refined the concept of the Dinner version and that I introduced Apology Dinner TM to the US (and UK).

My sister is taking all the credit because she says that her getting mad about the *potluck* aspect is what triggered my post in the first place.

So yeah, TIFU (well yesterday) because I was trying to bring everyone together, but I didn't realize that a little post could go viral and create more drama. People are mad again, but I don't care anymore.

TL;DR: I wrote about my family's Apology Dinner TM on Reddit. #ApologyDinner trended to #1 on Twitter. Now the family is arguing about who created the concept.

Great content gets shared, bookmarked, and most importantly, linked to. It becomes a linkable asset that drives real results.

# What Makes Content “Linkable”?

Think of linkable assets as content with magnetic appeal: stuff that actually helps people solve problems, not just checks SEO boxes. These pieces attract backlinks naturally because they’re genuinely useful, insightful, or demonstrably better than the thousandth recycled listicle floating around.

The best part? You don’t need a massive marketing team or huge budget. You just need to be helpful, a little creative, and willing to share something worth sharing.

**7 Types of Linkable Assets That Drive Results**

***1. Comprehensive How-To Guides***

**Example:** “The Complete Guide to Setting Up Google My Business (2025 Edition)”

Give people step-by-step instructions they can actually follow. Help them *do* something, not just think about it.

***2. Original Data & Customer Insights***

**Example:** “We Asked 100 Local Shoppers What Makes Them Choose One Business Over Another”

Got customer data? That’s gold. Package your insights, and suddenly you’re the authoritative source others want to cite.

***3. Visual Content & Infographics***

**Example:** “Local SEO Explained: Visual Breakdown for Business Owners \[Infographic\]”

Take something complex, make it visual. People love sharing content that makes complicated topics easy to understand.

***4. Free Tools & Resources***

**Example:** “Local SEO ROI Calculator: What’s Your Website Traffic Actually Worth?”

Create something useful and give it away. That’s not just good karma—it’s link-building gold.

***5. Case Studies & Success Stories***

**Example:** “How One Coffee Shop Tripled Foot Traffic Using Instagram Reels”

Nothing proves expertise like real results. Share client wins (with permission) and the specific strategies that worked.

***6. Expert Roundups***

**Example:** “10 Marketing Experts Share Their #1 Growth Tip for Small Businesses”

Can’t create all the insights yourself? Curate them. Interview industry experts (they’ll likely share the content too).

***7. Curated Resource Lists***

**Example:** “15 Essential Free Tools Every Small Business Owner Should Use”

Save people time by doing the research for them. A well-curated list can become the go-to resource in your industry.

# Why This Strategy Works (Especially for Small Businesses)

**Natural Link Building:** No awkward outreach emails. Create genuinely helpful content, and people will want to link to it.

**Authority Building:** Comprehensive guides and original data establish you as the expert, not just another service provider.

**Improved Rankings:** More quality backlinks mean higher search authority and better rankings.

**Social Sharing:** Useful content gets passed around naturally: visuals, tools, and actionable advice spread organically.

**Problem Solving:** When you answer questions people are actually searching for, they find you.

# Real-World Example

Say you run a landscaping business. You create a “Seasonal Lawn Care Checklist for \[Your City\] Homeowners.”

Who might link to it?

* Local home improvement bloggers
* Homeowner community forums
* Real estate agents’ resource pages
* Local news sites covering seasonal topics

That’s content working for you 24/7, earning links while you sleep.

***The Bottom Line***

Linkable assets aren’t about being flashy or keyword-stuffed. They’re about being genuinely useful.

Content-based SEO isn’t dead because no AI can replicate your real experience running a business, solving customer problems, or understanding your local market.

You’ve got the expertise and the stories. Now package them in a way that earns you the links, traffic, and credibility you deserve.

1kyutay,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausadhd/comments/1kyutay/denied_being_diagnosed_treated_at_all_due_to/,Denied being diagnosed + treated at all due to medical cannabis,"Hi guys, 

I'm a 24 (f), and this is my first post here mostly as I'm genuinely so distressed about this news coming in. For context, I am diagnosed autism and anxiety, and currently taking melatonin and medical cannabis for sleep due to insomnia that is sparked by my anxiety and hyperactive mind that won't let me sleep. 

I've read a lot about how psychatrists should be fine to diagnose and treat ADHD if the MC is at night and not necessarily super regular. As this is the case for how I use it, I presumed informing them of my medical cannabis use would be fine and didn't wish to be dishonest as I know in some ways the MC may interact with certain types of stimulants and therefore they'd keep it in mind for treatment.

Instead their denied even diagnosing me due to safety concerns of future treatment, which seems weird to me considering they don't even know how or why I use the medication and the fact it is medication literally for my hyperactive mind. This has now really spooked me for getting diagnosed, as I dont see how a way people with ADHD would try and manage their symptoms would end up completely cutting me off from diagnosis and treatement which would help me a lot as I keep having a rotation of productivity and then burning out for months. I was just about to start a new job that's going to be more intensive as I need the money which is why I tried to get diagnosed back months ago. 

This is also after having to chase them down for treatment as they lost my referral and made me have to do the extra work to grab it from my doctor and send it directly (even though the doctor confirmed it was sent), they then just deny it. 

I'm honestly just really upset as I spent so long trying to just get to referral to them knowing there would be a wait time added and now I will probably have to try to track down another psychatrist and run the exact same risk. 

I guess my rant is mostly just to also ask if others know of psychatrists in Victoria that do not limit their diagnosis and treatment due to MC use for the exact thing im trying to get diagnosed for? I would even stop using it if I could just get medication that would help me function during the day, but right now getting enough sleep and then coffees is the only way I can keep coping through my day to day life.

1kyuso5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kyuso5,Completed kitchen (using prefab Matchless cabinets),"(made a mistake and deleted, reposting)

We recently completed our outdoor kitchen, as part of a backyard glow-up. People here provided a lot of useful feedback. Here's some pics and notes about the (long, mostly fun, sometimes agonizing) process of landing on a design and getting it done.

We hired help putting this together turnkey, and opted for pre-fab cabinets from Matchless. I have no affiliation with Matchless, but I admire what they are doing and I'm a fan. If anyone wants help with build-out and lives around Austin, Frank at Laguna Construction did an amazing job for us.

The countertops are a dense limestone (Leuder Stone); The stone looks gorgeous (to me) but will require annual sealing and tbh the jury is still out on that decision.

I wanted a kitchen that would flow with our space, vs. creating a ""cockpit"" or galley setup. My own personal preference: I didn't want a bunch of stainless facings. At first, I was pretty excited about the style of kitchen offered by WWOO. Open. No enclosures. I don't like the way that company behaves on Reddit, but they have licensed a ""fresh"" looking design/fabrication approach and it's an aesthetic worth noting and sure to be widely copied. Ruled that out due to cost, practicality, and ultimately wanting enclosed space.

The sink receives water from a normal hose bib and a buried line. Frost isn't a big consideration here (Austin). I considered just draining the sink into some gravel, but Frank @ Laguna advised digging a dry well of 36"" diameter and 36"" deep, and draining into a perforated container in the dry well. I will be careful to keep food scraps/drippings out of the drain, but it is 10' from the sink and fully buried where critters can't get to it. Feels super solid. As many folks have mentioned here, the sink is a wonderful component to have.

Something I like about the aluminum cabinets: Linear-foot per linear-foot, there is a TON of storage. I looked at doing something with CMU+Stucco+Stainless inserts. If I had gone DIY that would have been a no-brainer. But that approach requires a lot of dead space, and I wanted lots of storage area. The Ooni fits into the cabinets, as well as some garden tools and a small (Cormorant) coffee roaster.

Matchless Cabinets had the 6 cabinet pieces custom built and delivered in about 10 calendar days from order. (Normally lead-times are a bit longer). They work with an Amish-community fabricator in Indiana, the stuff is sold and made by small business in 'murica, there are no tariff concerns and nobody is taking huge markups for carrying inventory or paying sales commissions or showroom fees. The cabinets are sick -- super practical, sharp, with soft-close drawer slides and weather stripping. I have built high-end custom cabinets from baltic birch with hardwood face frames and I'm a bit of a perfectionist -- these cabinets are square and tight and just sick. We had a violent rain storm this week and the drawers took on a few tablespoons of water, but for my purposes they are the best-case scenario for weatherproof outdoor cabinetry.

If you're at all interested in prefab custom cabinets, I am a big fan of Matchless and recommend checking them out. They provide insanely great service, and the cabinets are even better than they look in pictures. Powder-coated aluminum, made in 'murica, and seriously the most insanely great customer service end-to-end of any major purchase I can remember.

Looking for a wholesome connection. 🫶,"**Hi there, Welcome to my post & thanks for checking it out!**

I am honestly exhausted in this dating game, endless swiping on faces in apps, meeting in questionable bars etc. and I am ready to meet my forever person if it's in the cards. No games here! Looking for someone I could grow to genuinely trust who won't flake out. I care more about the substance of the person & want to take care of someone else to the best of my ability in all ways too.

Obviously physical attraction does matter to a degree, but you don't need to be perfect. I just want that person I really click with and hopefully we can enjoy each other's company. Play some video games, have a laugh, or just chit chat. I wish I could be truly excited by someone's presence again. That kind of thing where you can't wait to talk to that person again.

# About me -

I'm an average looking slightly nerdy but masculine guy. I'm 5'8, white, have curly hair, and have an average physique but have started working out a bit. Not fat but not skinny either. I think I look decent. I will be glad to swap pics once we've been chatting for a little while. I am an INTJ / Ambivert. I look pretty young for my age, I get mistaken as someone in their early to mid 20s all the time. Still have all my hair. (lol)

I have a lot of hopes, dreams, and goals. I try my best to be kind and caring. I would say I have a dry sense of humor, and enjoy deep conversations about life that could go anywhere. I'm not a city person but I don't like living in the middle of nowhere either.

I enjoy a variety of different things. I love playing video games even though lately I haven't had time. Doing anything outdoors when the weather is nice calms me and makes me relax. I enjoy hiking trails around here locally.

Road trips, exploring new music (lets swap music?) , reading books, long drives through the countryside with good coffee and conversation, watching movies or shows, and listening to podcasts. If you play certain games, I will gladly play them with you! I'm also open to trying new hobbies with my partner. I enjoy going to food festivals and trying new types of food too.

I live in a small-ish town here in NC and don't really get the opportunity to meet people outside of work too often due to having a busy week, then being too tired on the weekends but I'd like to change that! I am a sweet guy who just wants that special spark with someone again. I want to meet a girl who will hijack my weekends and prevent me from becoming a workaholic, lol.

Long story short, I want to enjoy quality time together even if it means just voice chatting at first. If you show me that you're worth it, I will make you a priority. Ideally I am not looking for someone too far away from me, but if you're really amazing I will make an exception. I'd like to move somewhere else, as I have grown up in NC and lived here my whole life, although I have traveled around quite a bit.

I have a stable career, college educated, no kids, and in good financial standing / financially responsible with no real debt or criminal record. I work two jobs and have a bachelors degree, and would love to meet someone for 2025. 🫶

1kyun3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1kyun3d/questions_on_qahwaarabic_style_coffee/,Questions on Qahwa/Arabic STYLE Coffee,"I'm honestly perplexed as to how little information there is on Arabic STYLE Coffee (not Arabica coffee bean species). I'm talking about that ultra light roast, almost darker than ""white-roast"", but less roasted than a traditional light roast coffee that people in the Arabian peninsula drink, particularly in Yemen and Saudi Arabia AKA Gulf/Emirati  Coffee. I have recently become very fascinated with it and have a bunch of questions on it and am seeking more information on it. Moreover, I would like to know what the coffee connoisseurs think about it, and how it falls in the coffee roast/taste/profile spectrum.

I will now continue to ask some questions and relay some of my thoughts about it:

Firstly, Qahwa just means Coffee in Arabic, and i'd argue that what we understand coffee to be today, that dark rich liquid, is not what Coffee started as. I believe coffee was first brewed in the middle east, and the form that they were drinking was much lighter, akin to what is drunk now and considered this Arabic Stye Coffee I talk about.

Now once again this is Arabic Style Coffee that typically is brewed with spices like Cardamom, Saffron, and/or Mastica, and I am not referring to the Arbica species of bean alongside Robusta, Liberica, etc. Every Arabic Style Coffee-drinking Arab Family has their own method for brewing this type of coffee that varies with how long they roast for, their grind size, spice mix, and cooking method/time.

Now my first question: there appears to be a very developed science of modern coffee, but there does not appear to be anything similar to this with Arabic Style coffee. Heck, I can't even find a single bag of Arabic beans that will yield that light, and not black, cup.

More questions:  Why did we start roasting beyond that Arabic Style roast level in the first place? What is the technical name for this level of roast? When does a roast that yields this tan/yellowish cup of coffee transform into that dark cup that we are familiar with? What is the effect of this light roast on caffeine content, as there is a lot of misinformation on the changes of caffeine with roast?

Lastly, I don't ever get withdrawal headaches when I drink Arabic-style coffee, prefer the taste more feeling as though there are less extreme notes, and the caffeine buzz is a lot more clean.

	•	1 egg
	•	A dash of hot sauce, soy sauce, or both

	3.	Introduce Irrelevant Variables:
Tear up the cheese slices and drop them in. Stir again. Add the peanut butter. This is the moment of transcendence or total collapse.
	4.	Add the Core Loop:
Crack the egg into the slop. Stir gently to let it cook into ribbons, or let it poach on top for drama.
	5.	Season with Machine Learning Algorithms:
Add sauces to taste. Too spicy? Add more peanut butter. Too bland? Throw in that suspicious leftover meat or sprinkle seasoning you can’t identify.
	6.	Final Touch:
Chop and throw in your sad vegetable. If it cooks slightly, great. If not, even better. Top with crushed chips or croutons for texture.

Serving Suggestion:

Serve directly from the pot, preferably while hunched over a keyboard. Eat with a spoon, a fork, or whatever implement is closest. Pairs well with existential dread or a lukewarm energy drink.

Ready to channel those **Nevermore Nineties** vibes with a modern twist? Let’s dive into how you can nail the perfect **Romantic Grunge** makeup look using today’s coolest products—no heavy-handed ‘90s powder pans required. Whether you’re a seasoned grunge goddess or a newbie to the dark side, these tips will have you feeling ethereal yet edgy in no time.

**Why Romantic Grunge?**  
It’s that sweet spot between softness and rebellion. Think smudgy liner meets rosy cheeks, muted lips meets a hint of shine. You get all the emo nostalgia without looking like you just rolled out of a time machine.

—‍—
INTRODUCTION  
I’m [Your Name], your alt-beauty nerd obsessed with pushing boundaries and remixing decades. I specialize in turning classic looks into fresh, wearable art—and today I’m sharing my **top secrets** for a ‘90s-infused grunge that’s chic enough for your next concert or coffee run.

—‍—
SKIN PREP FOR GRUNGE PERFECTION  
1. **Hydrating glow base**: Skip matte foundations. Opt for a lightweight, dewy formula—think cushion compacts or tinted serum foundations.  
2. **Conceal with purpose**: Spot-correct blemishes or dark circles, but let a little imperfection peek through. The goal is *lived-in cool.*  
3. **Subtle contour & cream blush**: Use a cream bronzer under cheekbones + a dollop of cream blush on apples of cheeks for a natural flush that won’t compete with your eyes or lips.

—‍—
EYES THAT SPEAK POETIC REBELLION  
- **Smudgy graphite liner**: A soft pencil in charcoal or dark brown is your BFF. Draw a thin line close to lashes, then smudge upward with a dense brush.  
- **Modular eyeshadow palettes**: Pick one with muted plums, dusty roses, and matte taupes. Layer a light rose shade on lids, then deepen outer corners with smokey plum.  
- **Mascara & Lashes**: One coat of volumizing mascara + optional spidery falsies. Keep them separated, not fluffy—think spiky, not dolly.

—‍—
LIPS THAT WHISPER DARK ROMANCE  
• **Stained lips**: Use a red or berry tint in the center, then blend out with fingers. The result? A soft gradient that lasts all day.  
• **Matte + Gloss hybrid**: Top a matte lipstick with a clear or slightly tinted gloss *just* in the center for dimension.  
• **Edgy liner trick**: Outline lips with a slightly darker pencil—don’t overblend. This little shadow adds instant depth.

—‍—
THE FINISHING TOUCHES  
• **Light dusting of setting powder**: Focus on T-zone only. Keep cheeks and high points glowy.  
• **Glossy inner-eye pop**: A dab of clear gloss or shimmer at the inner corners brings that romantic dewiness.  
• **Hair & accessories**: Tousled waves, butterfly clips, velvet scrunchies, or a leather choker to complete the 90s-grunge persona.

—‍—
UNIQUE INSIGHT:  
Next time you’re craving color, swap your usual cheek stash for a **lip tint**—it doubles as blush AND eyebrow color if you’re feeling experimental. Trust me, this hack cuts down your makeup bag by 2 items and looks effortlessly *art-school cool.*

Later on, we shared STI tests and he told me there was just one thing left to do before we could meet again (the nudes). At this point, I was very reluctant. I told him I would rather do it after spending more time together. He ended things, saying he didn't think this would work because he couldn't proceed with the arrangement without the pictures. That was fine with me because it seemed really shady. Any insight on what might have been his thought process? I've been so curious about this for a while now.

It’s Reshaping Global Hiring in 2025,"We’ve all seen the shift, Zoom calls, Slack threads, and coffee over WiFi. But what’s happening behind the scenes of the hybrid-remote revolution in 2025 is a full-blown **labour market transformation**.

We just published our latest report using labour market data from JobsPikr, and the numbers are clear:  
**Remote and hybrid jobs are no longer a side option; they're central to how companies plan, hire, and pay.**

Here’s what stood out:

* **IT, healthcare, staffing, and marketing** are leading the remote revolution (100K+ job postings per sector in 2025)
* But despite the hype, **office jobs still dominate in volume**, especially in healthcare and retail, showing a hybrid world, not a fully remote one
* Companies are **hiring beyond borders**: Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe are hotspots for tech and finance remote roles
* Median salaries vary **wildly** across sectors, some industries are using remote roles to cut costs, while others are paying top dollar for senior global hires

So, how are smart companies responding?

* They're using **labour market analytics** to map high-supply, low-cost remote talent (think beyond big cities)
* Creating **custom hybrid policies** by team, not department
* Aligning compensation models with **geo-specific benchmarks** to stay fair and competitive
* Investing in **async workflows and collaboration tools** to keep remote output tight

This isn’t just about work-from-home flexibility, it’s about **global access to skills**, **cost-efficiency**, and **future-ready workforce planning**.

If you’re in HR, talent acquisition, or trying to make sense of remote strategy in your org, you’ll want to see the data.

But the *nature* of that value has evolved dramatically.

Here’s the honest breakdown:

# 🎯 The Real Value of In-Person Events Today

# 1. Trust and Relationship Building — at Hyper Speed

✅ Online interactions build *awareness* and *credibility*.  
✅ **In-person interactions build** ***trust*** **— fast.**

When people meet face-to-face:

* Micro-signals (tone, body language, energy) create stronger emotional bonds.
* Trust accelerates *years* faster than through DMs, emails, or Zooms.

**Bottom line:**

>

# 2. Breaking Through Digital Fatigue

✅ Everyone is overloaded with digital pitches, webinars, ads, and LinkedIn messages.  
✅ In-person events cut through that noise — they feel *more intentional and rare*.

**Bottom line:**

>

# 3. Serendipity and Unexpected Opportunities

✅ Online networking is planned and linear:  
You connect because of a title, an industry, a cold DM.

✅ In-person networking is *messy* — and that’s where magic happens:

* Bumping into a future co-founder at the coffee table
* Meeting a VC casually over a dinner
* Discovering a game-changing supplier in a hallway conversation

**Bottom line:**

>

# 4. Stronger Brand Impressions

✅ In-person events allow you to *show* your brand values — not just talk about them.

Whether it’s:

* A handshake
* A thoughtful question during a panel
* Hosting a VIP dinner
* Your booth design and energy

**Bottom line:**

>

# 5. Feedback You Can’t Get Online

✅ At events, you see *real reactions* instantly:

* Are people excited about your offer?
* Are they confused about your messaging?
* What objections or emotions surface *unfiltered*?

✅ Online, feedback is slower, more formalized, or sometimes hidden entirely.

**Bottom line:**

1kyub43,https://i.redd.it/i7uopmt13s3f1.png,The 2 Most Likely Scenarios,"I have a huge fear of sharks (as I'm sure many of us do), so I've been studying attacks for a while to learn more about shark behavior and where to avoid swimming. Learning about these attacks makes me incredibly sad for the victim who had to experience such a traumatic last moment and those who had to witness it, so I apologize if my analysis of this case is upsetting to anyone who personally knew him. I have a few observations after comparing this situation to other shark attacks.

After watching the footage many times, I don’t believe Cameron lost any limbs in the video. It may have happened later, but there's no clear evidence of it in the recorded moments. I think the most likely scenario is that he panicked after encountering something in the water, got pulled by the current, and ultimately drowned from exhaustion. A second possibility is that he was bitten after he drifted farther away from the boat, but we can’t confirm that from the footage.

Some points below to counter some claims/questions I see on this sub - feel free to respond to any of these specifically to debate me on them if anyone is interested lol, I'm not claiming that everything I say is without a doubt how things happened but just the conclusions I came to from research and my personal experience in the water/encounters with sharks. 

* **If the current took him away, why didn't the life ring immediately get taken away?**
   * The life ring (more buoyant) floats on the water surface and is more impacted by wind, while Cameron’s body (denser) was deeper and more vulnerable to the pull of the current. Currents can vary greatly even a few feet apart so he could have experienced a stronger pull after swimming to the front of the boat.
* **How can a healthy young athlete not survive in the water long enough for the rescue team to find him?**
   * Being athletic doesn't mean he is a strong swimmer, I see people claim he was a ""strong swimmer"" on here but I found no articles online to corroborate this so please let me know the source for that info... but even strong swimmers may not last long if they swim against a current. 
   * If he panicked once he got too far from the boat and attempted to swim back, he would have wasted all of his energy immediately, which would make treading water for hours afterward much more difficult unless he knew to float and calm down to conserve the rest of his energy. The parents said in an interview that the weather was horrible that night and all of the kids were cold and wet, so he would have tired out more easily in those conditions. Even though I was a lifeguard, I have been in situations in the water after drinking where I could have easily died if I panicked and wasted all of my energy, so I don't think it's a crazy scenario. 

* **The footage clearly shows him punching a shark and swimming away from something/why didn't he swim towards the life ring?**
   * I believe he either saw or felt something touch him, likely a shark. There's a lot of marine life in the Bahamas that will bump you because they are curious, so it could have been a large fish as well. I instinctively punch/splash the water in the same way when I feel something touch me to scare away whatever it is. I think he swam away in fear of whatever this was and never saw the life ring. It looked like he had already started to swim away in the opposite direction the moment they threw it, so it would be more difficult for him to see where it was floating in the water from his vantage point and in the dark.
* **What about all the sharks in the footage** **attacking him?**
   * I only see one potential shark - the splash with a zig-zag movement that could be a dorsal fin (pic attached). The splash shape itself actually looks like a normal pattern to me based on the usual waves I see around an anchored boat, it's the appearance of something slicing through the water for half a second that makes me think it could be a shark... but it may just be an illusion because of how poor video quality is in the dark. The other splash on the top left that some people claim is a dorsal fin is way too large and oriented incorrectly to our vantage point. I also don’t see blood; all of the other “evidence” people point to (like red pixels or strange splashes) can be explained by low-light artifacts and typical surface disturbances. I'm confident the “shark at his feet” is his feet kicking the surface of the water; there would be way more movement and thrashing if it were a shark biting him. The idea that the camera caught shark eyes seems unlikely, given that the resolution and lighting can't even make out Cameron's facial features while he is above the surface. Enhancing a video of such low quality and drawing shapes in the water and glitches in the pixels feels like finding shapes in clouds.
   * Cameron's movements/reactions do not look like the movements of someone who is having limbs ripped off. I don't know if any of you have seen that horrible video of the shark attack in Egypt where a 23-year-old lost both of his arms within seconds, there was a lot of thrashing and blood splashing everywhere in that attack from just one shark. That man was yanked under with both of his legs fully out of the water, upside down and kicking when his second arm was taken off.  He was not able to swim away once the attack began because he could not swim with one arm, he was screaming for help throughout the attack and every witness was horrified. People were so disturbed by how vicious the attack was that they immediately hunted down the shark and tortured it before killing it. That attack was uniquely brutal because the shark was pregnant and very hungry. It's extremely rare for a shark to fully devour someone like that, but Egypt doesn't control overfishing so sharks have significantly less food there. 
* **Additional points:**
   * Normally, a shark does not immediately attack a human unprovoked, and not to that severity unless they are extremely malnourished and starving.... even if someone was chumming the water recently. The Bahamas is one of the best places to be a shark imo, there's a lot of food due to the fishing laws there. Out of the 34 unprovoked shark attacks in the Bahamas' recorded history, one third were fatal. And most of the deaths were from blood loss while being taken to safety after a partial limb loss, there are just a few incidents that are anywhere close to the severity of the Egypt attack. Even the shark experts that have weighed in online on what happened to Cameron say if it was an attack, it was most likely one bite that led to blood loss, which killed him.
   * The reactions of most of the kids on the boat who were watching do not line up with witnessing Cameron being violently attacked by a shark. I also don't believe he was pulled underwater at any point because of how nonchalant some of the witnesses are. He looks like he fades out because of how far he's getting from the boat into the darkness, but still above water. I believe they just saw him drift away and assumed the boat would be able to get to him quickly, which is why some of their reactions seem so callous. I think he unfortunately did jump on his own accord, the boat is way smaller than a cruise ship and anchored, so he mistakenly assumed it would be easy to get back on, and you are much more confident and invincible when you are a drunk teenager. 
   * I also don't really understand the theories around a ""cover-up"". I could see witnesses being quiet about the incident due to the life insurance, or due to some private settlement/agreement between the family and the excursion company. But it's no secret that there are tons of sharks in the water in the Bahamas. Attacks are rare, but there is always a chance when you go in shark-infested water. But this incident, although tragic, was a situation where he wasn't supposed to jump into the water. I'd say the incidents during snorkeling excursions would be way worse for tourism than this one... yet those were not ""covered up"". I think the official story doesn't include sharks because of the lack of clear evidence of a shark attacking him on camera, and no witnesses confirming they saw a shark attack. We also know that there's other footage we haven't seen that authorities have, that may show him drifting further from the boat still alive in one piece. 

**TLDR:** I believe the most likely scenario is that he saw or felt something touch him in the water, splashed to scare it away, and began to swim away from it while looking to his right in search of a way to get back up on the front of the boat. I think he intended on swimming around the front to the other side to keep looking for a way to get up, but the current pushing in the opposite direction caused him to stop fighting it to conserve energy. He thought they would imminently pick up anchor and rescue him. As he drifted further away and started losing sight of the boat, he may have panicked and attempted to swim towards it, leading to his exhaustion. I am not ruling out a shark attack, but I really don't think he was injured in the footage. I only see one potential shark (photo attached), but it looks like it's circling him or doing exploratory passes by him, not attacking. I think he either drowned from exhaustion, or died of blood loss if he was bitten at some point further away from the boat.

What to do?,"**TL;DR: Should I talk to someone (coworker, HR, manager) about my coworker's increasingly bad behaviour and spiraling relationship with alcohol?**

I 28F work for a smallish manufacturing company. My coworker/direct supervisor (29M) is a functional alcoholic and his behaviour is spiraling. I don't know what to do. Or if I should do anything. 

We are both mechanical engineers. Our office is set up in a way that completely isolates the engineering department (5 ppl) from the rest of the building. Our other coworkers in the engineering department are slightly older than us, male, and happily married with kids. 

Because we are close in age and both single, he tries to socialize with me. A lot. More than with the other guys. Aside from our similar ages and profession we have next to nothing in common. I am a staunch non-drinker. There's a lot of alcoholism in my family. I recognize I have a moderately addictive personality and I just don't want to risk becoming an alcoholic. I've tasted alcohol and I don't like it. I'm not going to force myself to drink to fit in socially and risk developing an addiction. The point is - I recognize that my relationship with alcohol can make me more sensitive to other people's drinking when I feel it's not being consumed in moderation. 

My coworker goes to breweries multiple times a week after work (I don't know how he affords it)*.* He constantly talks about going to the liquor store. At first I thought this was a ""verbal alcoholic"" thing. like saying ""I could use a drink"" and then going home and *not* drinking 9/10 times (this is what my mother does). 

Then we went on an 3 day work trip together (5ish months ago, just the two of us). The dude drank on the plane, in the airport during layover, on the second plane, in the hotel lounge, at every restaurant, at the hotel bar, etc etc. He was legitimately wasted for a good chunk of the trip. To the point where I was concerned enough to insist on driving the rental car (which his fragile ego could not handle). While drunk he admitted to me (not sure he remembers this) that his mom thinks he's an alcoholic. I didn't say anything. I didn't think it was my place and he was drunk and angry enough that I was already really uncomfortable (my dad was a violent and angry drunk - there is trauma there).

Since then, his behaviour is getting increasingly concerning. He's becoming more and more bitter and angry at work. He's constantly being negative about our products, workplace, coworkers, etc etc. He literally walks into work every morning and says ""Who's ready for another day of bullshit?"" instead of saying good morning like a reasonable person. He talks about *hoping* the products fail and there's an avalanche of warranty complaints that bankrupt the company (resulting in *all* of us being unemployed?!?). He's constantly showing me videos of violent video games and hockey fights and laughing at how funny they are (during coffee/lunch breaks - which I take at my desk). Both of which he knows I'm not into. To be clear, I'm not against the violence in the game/sport generally speaking but I'm extremely uncomfortable by his sheer delight in the violence aspect of it specifically. It's the only thing he focuses on in those videos. He laughs when I cringe as someone's video game head gets blown off. I'll admit I'm a little squeamish around blood. Even obviously fake video game blood.

His review of my engineering work is becoming *super* ornery and *kind of condescending* to the point of absurdity. I'm not perfect. I absolutely make mistakes. I'm fairly easy-going, try to do my best, learn from my mistakes, and not take the criticisms personally. However, his criticisms of my drawings lately have been things like ""that dimension isn't pulled *far enough* away from the part"" or ""you listed the dual dimension \[metric\] \[imperial\] (company standard) instead of \[imperial\] \[metric\] (which is wrong according to company standard) - which is an incorrect criticism of my work. I'm starting to get frustrated especially because he gives me these criticisms verbally peppered with condescending little laughs. Like ""this is wrong haha"". It makes me feel like a moron. My work can't get released unless I jump through his increasingly arbitrary hoops. Meanwhile his attitude is becoming more toxic by the day and he *constantly* talks about drinking, violence, and being generally negative to the point where I'm genuinely concerned about him and increasingly want to be nowhere near him. 

I've worked with this guy for about 2.5 years now. His behaviour in the past 6-7 months has been a complete downward spiral in terms of attitude and drinking habits (that he admits freely without prompting). He's not a bad guy and he's never been a ray of sunshine, but his behaviour is getting out of hand and the frequency with which he talks about drinking (alone) is starting to really concern me. 

**Should I say anything? To him? To HR (about the work stuff)? To our engineering manager?** 

I feel like it's not my place. We're just coworkers and there's the added awkwardness of being his only female coworker who happens to only be about 1 year younger than him. He's made comments (yellow-flag stuff) before about me that have me wondering if he maybe has a crush on me. One particular instance was when we got company tickets to a local minor league hockey game. Everyone got a +1 ticket. I don't like sports very much but it was a ""strongly encouraged"" company outing so I went. Some people took their kids, friends, etc. It wasn't strictly a romantic +1. I (single) got an extra ticket because my best friend loves hockey. Coworker saw me getting a second ticket from the receptionist and freaked out ""Are you bringing a *date?!?""* He sounds shocked and a little hurt? I brushed it off and told him I was taking a friend. I don't think of him that way at *all.* 

But I know his family lives out of state, he has no friends in this state (maybe at all?), and no girlfriend. He lives alone. I'm just a coworker but we're friendly and I do care about him the same way I care about all my coworkers (platonic, hope the best for them, don't particularly want to see them outside of work but would give any of them a ride to/from work if they were in a pinch and not too far out of my way).",2,1748575436.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

A few months ago my mother arrived at my doorstep with all of her belongings, and with my little 9-year-old brother. Apparently she had nowhere to go. I always kept low-minimal contact with her because I still wanted to be close to my little brother. She said she'll only be at my place for a few days, I panicked at the suddenness of it all and just let them inside. Big mistake. But I was worried for my little brother. I didn't want him to be homeless.

A few days after, the police called and I had to tell them that she's staying at my place. Then child protective services. They wanted her back to some child-mother living facility. Apparently she had escaped and absolutely refuses to go back there. They would even come knock on my door but she'd never let them in.

I'm afraid that my little brother might be taken away. I know my mother isn't the best, but I think living in children's home would be more traumatic for him. My little brother has some anger issues and maybe ADHD or mild-autism, and some other health-issues. I feel so bad for him.

The thing is, for the past month, the police, the child protective services, all of them suddenly just stopped reaching out. It's like they completely forgot about her and vanished.

Now I'm just stuck living with her and my little brother in my one-room apartment. She always keeps the keys. She's full of bad habits, she doesn't go to sleep until morning, lets my brother stay on my computer all day/night long, drinks Cola and coffee everyday, smokes, no job and hasn't had a proper one in over a decade, she has -20k in her bank account and stays all day on Facebook watching some weird arab prince content. I think her Facebook account is hacked too. She used to be alcoholic and horribly abused by my father during my childhood. I've seen and lived through some horrible things in the past. I barely talk to her, just stay in one corner of the room waiting for things to pass.

I'm so stuck. I thought I escaped and now I'm dragged back down. I'm not rich enough to rent them another place. I'm trying to save up, but there is no guarantee that everything will turn out okay. I don't know what to do. I'd have cut contact with her long time ago if not for my little brother.",1,1748574641.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Seemed like a fun AI experiment, until ChatGPT ""guessed"" that the husband was into a younger woman whose name started with E and even hinted he might be cheating. The wife believed it and actually filed for divorce. The guy had no idea any of this was happening. Just wild. It’s a good reminder that while these models are cool, they're just predicting text—they don't actually know anything. Kind of alarming how easily someone can blur the line between playful use and treating AI like it's some kind of all-knowing oracle. Makes me wonder if we’re starting to trust these tools more than we should, or if this was just one extreme case.

Details are: 

- 1st date was coffee for an hour, cut short because I had to go to a house inspection afterwards. 2nd date was a wine bar for 2.5 hours, we had work the next day so didn’t go that late. Easy conversation (although some awkward silences still) and heaps in common. This is less time than the first date with both ex boyfriends which worries me a bit, as those felt more natural/romantic. My last boyfriend, we’d already kissed, texted a lot and cuddled by the 3rd date.
- There were parts of the 2nd date where I felt super attracted to him/butterflies but then other parts where I really didn’t. This has never happened to me before.
- We haven’t had much physical contact on either date (apart from hello/goodbye hugs) but he was leaning closer to me at the wine bar and said he definitely wants to see me again at the end of our 2nd date. We don’t text that much between dates which is unlike my exes too, where I got really excited about messages. 
- I’m stressed because sometimes I did want to kiss him (I also miss physical closeness) but other times I really didn’t/the idea of it stressed me out. 

My last relationship: 
I was blindsided by a breakup before this (2yr relationship ended 1yr 4months ago - avoidant ex) which hit me really hard. I’ve done therapy and all the stuff you’re supposed to do. I’m craving intimacy (and know it’s been a while) but also feel scared at the idea of it which is frustrating.

I’m stressed because my last 2 boyfriends, I had zero doubts about from first meeting them. I instantly wanted them and things flowed very easily. Texting/banter was better with both of them also. But they were also more “smooth”, very forward and maybe too ‘player-ish’. They both had commitment issues and I feel saw relationships as replaceable because getting women is easy for them. This guy is more introverted and not forward at all. 

Tl;dr Should I give it a 3rd date or is my confusion/lack of excitement about this current guy a bad sign? I’ve always prided myself on being black and white with guys - I’m either super into it or not at all. I’ve never been in-between those feelings with someone before and I can’t help comparing to my exes which felt different in the beginning, even if they didn’t work out.

to set the stage in case there is relation, when i was 14 around late 2017 and early 2018 i notice that i cannot raise my leg to a step that really steep when i used to be able to, when i doing that my hip start hurting. and it just keep getting harder and harder to raise my hip, until mid 2018 where i can't walk at all, i stay wheelchair bound for around 1 month, and mom get me to doctor and month later, i can walk again albeit it still hurt, but i still on medicine for three years i believe, i can walk normally now, though i cannot raise my right leg past my hip and my left leg to let say an average height stair, now this not walking thing is done a lot to me mentally as an akward child, i never really go to anywhere for past 7 years, unless it something close with my close friend, i never go out by myself, as i also have anxiety talking to people.

my sleep schedule is changed around 3 years ago, where i switch between sleep at night for a week to sleep at day for months. for me to get sleep is to get myself really tired, but for most part i sleep on schedule albeit with the day cycle switched, and also sometimes is ignored how tired i am and really want to sleep just so that i can sleep at the right schedule, usually at dawn, or night around 7, but i have no concrete schedule, it just me trying to cope so i can feel better about my anxiety, atleast i can manage.

around may 3rd, when i get home from my shift around 9 at night, i feel really tired and want to sleep, since i only sleep from 5 to 9 that morning, only three hours because my siblings cause a rucus, and i feel tired around 3pm and i just ignored it even though i really want to sleep, because another thing about myself is that i really don't like breaking schedule if that task is not related to me. so i ignore it until i finish at 9 at night, and went straight to bed but after a couple of minute like 10 minute or so, my heart suddenly began to pulsing faster and louder i can feel it on my entire body, and really unpleasant feeling on my chest,
my breath is sporadic and feel only small percentage of the air i breath reach my lung when i breath normally, and when i tried to breath with my chest i can feel some relief but temporarily and sometimes i would breath and try to compressed my chest to force my lung to absorb the air, i didn't have anxiety or anything that dat,but my anxiety also join in right after that. i felt fear, confuse, my entire thought for that entire night is ""what if this persist?"" until the next day. i let my mom know at 6 and she bring me to doctor (local doctor), and i thought at first it was my anxiety cause this, so that what i explain to the doctor as probable cause. my mom said it just stomach acid ricing, cause i also have it in my history.so he gave me medicine for that, and i still cannot sleep, cause when try that same heart beat come back, and i really cannot focus trying to sleep. until at 11:30am when i feel slightly tired, and i really force myself to sleep and i did, i sleep from 11:30am to 6pm where i wake up briefly and then i sleep again until 1am

my mom get me to psychiatrist the next day and say that it's normal, i still got 6 hour of sleep after all he said, and instead he pass me into psychologists, i admit it help me a bit

i have anxiety about that for the a whole week, it's just the same thought ""what if i get that again?, and exactly 2 weeks later after that first night, i get it again, and the night of my shift too, but it was not my heart start pulsing really loudly, it gradually worsen and worsen. this time i also remember that my stomach also felt weird, i dont know if i feel hungry or full, but since it still early around 11 i make myself a instant noodle, it felt horrible in my mouth my i stomach all of it. it peak around 4, and i wake up from 5am the day before, so i told my mom at 5 that i get it again, but this time i get sleepy and sleep at 5.  and again the entire week i felt anxious.

and almost two weeks later, last night i get it again but now with much more detail. so after i get back from my shift i walk a bit to my friend and stay for an hour i, and i start feeling sleepy, so i get back right to my bed. this time i remember i got really distracted by my thought, its like a passing thought, cause i didn't remember any of it, my stomach really start acting around 12, and again i don't know if it was hungry or i just eat too much, and i make sure i dindt eat to full at dinner. and after 12 my breath just got worse and worse. but i didn't feel anxiety at all for the entire night, only when it got to 5am that i start anxious, i told my mom and she agree to get me to the doctor again (same doctor as in the first night) and he had the same opinion that it just stomach acid raising and my anxiety, and get back to my home and after taking the medicine, my stomach still wasn't feel alright, and my breathing is still short, and write this post.

last night is when i realized that it might be not my anxiety causing this, cause i don't have at all for the entire night, only when it was 5am did i get it. so my symtom is i get difficult breathing, and when i try to sleep (as in laying on my side and close my eye) and only when i do try to sleep that my heart would start beating faster and louder and felt unplesant, my hand and feet sometime felt tingly, it felt like as if i was chased by something, if i open my eye and sleep at different position looking upright the heart beating is gone, but my breath still terrible, this heart beating is the one that cause me to not fall asleep, and my anxiety is only this thought that 'what if i cannot sleep', before this is i usually sleep normally from around 9-11 to 5 after that first night and that psychologist visit. as i am wrinting this post, my stomach still feel unplesant and breath is still bad i still cannot sleep and even though i am out of bad my anxiety is still pumping my heart.

so what's wrong with me, anyone had answer?
some point that might help diagnose even if it is embarassing. my mom is the second cousin of my father, i sick a lot when i was a child, mainly physical, though i start not walking only when i was teenager, i used to complain that my knee hurt ever since i was 5. since i usally get physical pain i didn't do a lot of physical activity. my mouth and nose is dry often,only drink water never had coffee or even tee except when i was at my shift(2 times a week) or go out with my friend, often i wake up and my nose and mouth is completely dry. i also peed a lot like if i drink a glass, 15 minutes later i would pee and after 15 minute again i peed again,repeat until my bladder empty. i am sexually active person, but only jacking off though, though some of my fapping material is fairly extreme like scat, try to cope with anxiety, so i can offset the heart beat cause with anxiety to watching porn, but i do really want to quit. think that might contribute to my anxiety is that politic can really trigger it, but i like watching or read those content, but around a year a ago that i start to stop it and now only watch 1 or 2 hour of essay on something. i also like to overthink stuff, which also contribute to the anxiety, you might notice when you reading this post. that's it maybe",1,1748574375.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I’ve tested Swiss Coffee, Simply White, and White Dove, and they all read too yellow - or even greenish in certain lighting. White Dove in particular looked muddy and picked up reddish tones in low light, especially next to the white trim and wainscoting.

If I’m keeping the current trim and ceiling color, would it make the most sense to just use that same color on the walls in a flat finish? Any other suggestions are more than welcome!",16,1748574252.0,interiordecorating,12,0.94,False
1kyttn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BangaloreSocial/comments/1kyttn0/where_are_the_chill_hangout_folks_in_bangalore/,Where are the chill hangout folks in Bangalore these days?,"Hey everyone,

24M here. Born and raised in Bangalore, but somehow finding it surprisingly tough to build those day-to-day friendships — the kind where you spontaneously text someone and say “Gym today?” or “Let’s hit a board game café this Sunday” or just chill with a chai and talk about life.

Some personal lore: I’ve got a decent circle of friends from school and college, but most have either moved out of Bangalore, are neck-deep in work, or have entered that “I only leave the house for groceries” era of adulthood. I’ve always been the kind of person who values those low-key, consistent, quality friendships — and I’ve realized recently that I’m really missing them.

I’m not much of a party guy, and pubs/clubs don’t really feel like my scene. I don’t drink or smoke, and I’m not super into nightlife culture — so that cuts out a large chunk of the usual “hangout” options people suggest. And while I’ve tried meetup events (board game cafes, poetry nights, hobby circles), they sometimes feel like one-off encounters — fun in the moment, but rarely translating into something lasting.

What I’m looking for:

A gym buddy (someone who can push and be pushed — I’m consistent, not ripped lol)

A cricket buddy — maybe some casual weekend matches or nets? I’m not gully cricket legend material but I can hold a bat and bowl without embarrassing myself too much

A board game buddy — cafes like Dialogues, Lahe Lahe, etc. are cool but it's more fun with the right crowd

Just someone who's down to hang out — could be walks, coffee, food, even just doing nothing much but chilling and vibing


I’m not super extroverted, but not a full introvert either. Somewhere in between. I can hold conversations, enjoy listening as much as talking, and I’m the kind of person who actually replies to messages.

I’ve come to accept that this stage of life — early 20s, post-college, pre-marriage, figuring-it-out phase — is one where a lot of us feel a little adrift. I know I do, sometimes. And I genuinely believe that a lot of us out here in Bangalore are quietly looking for the same thing: connection, not just interaction.

So yeah — if you’re in a similar headspace, around my age, and feel like we could vibe over shared hobbies or just the occasional gym session or board game night, drop a message or leave a comment.

Let’s try building something offline for a change. :)

Peace out,
A guy who still believes in friendship in the digital age.

1kytsls,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1kytsls/has_chicago_ever_felt_underwhelming_to_you_is_it/,Has Chicago ever felt underwhelming to you? Is it just me?,"I moved here recently. I grew up in Rockford, Illinois, but I haven't been in this state in around 7 years. Recently, I spent around a year and a half in London and a month in Tokyo.

Having moved from those places, Chicago just feels dead and empty to me. It doesn't feel like a city. I live in Avondale right now, in a more suburban area, but even when I go to a place like Logan Square or the Loop or wherever, it doesn't feel like anything is happening. It doesn't feel like there's any motion.

In London, there's always a massive crowd. I mean, it's like 10 times the amount of people here. You can always find people performing in the tube stations, on street corners, and the crowd feels alive. London is a massive multicultural center, and you can always hear like 5 different languages at once.

Or take Shibuya; the crossing has thousands of people in going in every direction. I saw a man with a horse mask playing drums, there was another man with a spandex suit and plastic bats saying ""hit me for 500 yen"", there's neon lights everywhere, people drive go-karts through the streets, etc. It feels like there's ""motion"", like the area has a life of its own. There's always a motion, and it never dies; even at 3 AM on Tuesday, people are still out.

I notice this lack even on the trains; the trains here are old, slow, and dirty. In Tokyo, the trains have TVs on them, and you can watch game shows and anime and all kinds of stuff. You see the people who into alternative fashion and wearing whatever collab is popular at the time, etc. In London too, the tube stations are bigger, you can get coffee there, there are more people playing music, there are more people on the train, etc. I remember one time, on the Jubilee Line, it got so crowded that I didn't even have space to turn my head; for about half an hour, when anyone wants to get off, about 20 people had get out to create room.

Here, on my daily blue line trip, barely anyone is on the train, and even in the CTAs ""crowded"" moments, it just doesn't feel anything like that.

I don't know if anyone has a similar feeling, but, for me, this feels more like a small town trying to be a big city than an actual big city. It's a bit disappointing; I have memories coming here when I was a kid, and I remember it feeling more like that. I guess that's how nostalgia works though.

I’m just doing a “soft” 16:8, where I’ll have a splash of lite milk in my morning coffee, and my nightcap cup of tea around 9:30.m, but strict around everything else. Some days it sort of organically becomes 18:6 depending on my schedule! I’m not intentionally calorie restricting - just listening to my body and eating within the window when I’m hungry, but that routine *has* put me in a caloric deficit.

So I’m losing weight quite effectively, and feeling good. But honestly it’s been faster than I thought. I’m down 5kg (11lbs) in 20 days! I suspect the first couple of those were water weight, but that still feels quite quick.

I’m not complaining, but I guess just wondering if I should be doing anything different, or slowing down at all?

For some, that might be enough time to heal—but for me, the grief still sits heavy. We had a very special bond (as I’m sure many of you can relate to). She wasn’t just my grandmother—she was my best friend, my role model, and in many ways, my anchor.

During her final months in hospice, I was battling a secret addiction to opioids—mainly oxycodone and Percocet. No one in my family, including her, knew. I share this not to shift focus, but because it colors the complexity of my grief and the guilt I still carry.

My grandmother had beaten breast cancer twice. The first time, I was around 8 years old, and she handled it with strength and grace. She’d lost her hair and said she loved wearing beautiful wigs and wraps. She always focused on the positive. She’d sit on the porch with coffee and remind me how beautiful life is. Those moments shaped who I am.

The cancer returned again when I was a teenager, and this time she had to undergo a mastectomy. Still, she was unbreakable to me. She had friends, a routine, a vibrant spirit. She had worked in television as a journalist and was well-known in both Cuba and Miami. Everyone loved her. She was elegant, kind, creative, and endlessly generous. I used to say I’d be lucky to become half the woman she was.

But about 15 years after her last fight, the cancer returned once more—this time in her liver, and it quickly spread. She chose to forgo chemotherapy. She knew it would only prolong the inevitable, and she wanted to be at home.

We’re a small, tight-knit family. My mom, uncle, and grandmother raised me. I’m an only child, and losing her felt like losing the foundation of my world. We all took turns caring for her—sleeping by her side, helping her to the bathroom, doing everything we could.

At first, she was still herself—joking, sipping coffee, even smoking the occasional cigarette. She told me she wasn’t afraid of death, but she was afraid of what dying would feel like. That has haunted me ever since.

Eventually, she couldn’t eat. Then she couldn’t keep water down. Her pain became unbearable. She was given morphine, which helped somewhat—but toward the end, she stopped speaking. She’d wake up crying out for her long-departed parents, confused and distressed. We did everything to comfort her, but it was heartbreaking to witness.

My uncle began researching self-euthanasia. We were devastated to learn it was illegal in Florida. Before she went non-verbal, she told us clearly: she was ready to go. But we couldn’t help her. She was trapped in her failing body, unable to voice her needs anymore, and there was nothing we could do.

I’m still so angry. Angry that we couldn’t give her the dignity of dying on her own terms. Angry that I don’t know what she was thinking or feeling in her final days. Angry that a woman who cherished life so deeply had to suffer so much in the end. She didn’t deserve that. No one does.

And I’m angry at myself—for using, for numbing, for not being fully present. At the time, I told myself I was coping, but the truth is, I hadn’t processed anything. Now, at 9 months sober, it’s all crashing down on me. The guilt. The grief. The regret.

I don’t know why I’m posting this. Maybe just to get it out. Maybe in hopes that someone else can relate. Maybe to say, publicly, that I want to advocate for the right to die with dignity. I truly believe terminally ill individuals should have the option to leave this world peacefully—on their terms, before they lose the ability to express that wish.

If you’ve experienced something similar, I’m so sorry. I hope you know you’re not alone.

Abue, I miss you more than I can put into words. I don’t believe in God or an afterlife, but I’m endlessly grateful that we coincided in this one. I love you always.",2,1748573947.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False
1kytq2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1kytq2n/coral_princessalaska_cruise_tour_51828/,Coral Princess-Alaska Cruise Tour 5/18-28,"First time/last time cruising with Princess! We started with the tour part of our journey in Fairbanks. The first night was fine, everything seemed fine from airport to hotel. Then the next two nights as we moved further into Alaska, seeing Denali, taking the train, things started to be a bit disorganized. They gave us hotel keys that did not work the second night. There was a hotel person there to let us in, but when I enquired as to how we needed to proceed to get our key fixed, she was kinda snotty. The third night, after a very long day, we were assigned an occupied room. So embarrassing as we bothered this man and his sick wife. When we went to guest services, no real apology and a lie were given but they did give us our actual room number this time. After an hour and half or so it was sorted. Too bad everything was now closed at the hotel, so we ate snacks and went to bed. 

Now onto the cruise. I had never cruised with Princess, but was always told how perfect they were to cruise to Alaska. I booked a cruise package that included the drink package. Here are the issues we ran into:

I quickly learned that the drink package was a pain as to what was included and you couldn’t have a can of soda, it had to be in a glass. They brought us fountain drinks all cruise that never tasted right. They also serve you in a tiny glass, but you cannot order two? Whatever. Makes them look petty and cheap. We don’t drink alcohol so I think a can of soda wouldn’t have bankrupted them. 

Then the food. Not good. Poor presentation, lots of mystery and hot orange juice and milk. Who puts milk in a container on a tray with no refrigeration and leaves it until it’s gone? Ew. The orange juice was so warm it could melt a whole glass of ice in 5 minutes. Gross. Salad bar was lacking. My husband had stomach issues after eating cold seafood and also again after eating a burger. He just stopped eating the day before the cruise ended because he was tired of all the issues. 

Their tracking app and medallion thing is a bit ridiculous. You could order drinks etc, but you may never get it. You’ll be charged though! I ordered a pizza to the state room because I didn’t want to brace the buffet and it came half cooked. I requested a refund, didn’t get it. 

Many of the staff seemed irritated, particularly at the bars around the ship. When they discovered you were on the drink plan, they stopped talking to you. 

Good things:

Room steward was absolutely on top of it. Super friendly too. 

Staff at the coffee shop was awesome. 

The excursions we took, salmon bake, wagon ride with dinner, lumberjack show and axe throwing, white pass train, glacier gardens and Mendenhall glacier were all outstanding. 

The captain did a great job showing us the glacier Bay and other sights from the ship. 

The naturalist on board was great. She did presentations and spent quite a bit of time on the mic sharing info and pointing out animals. 

Park service rangers were very informative and helpful at Glacier Bay. 

Overall, I give it a 7/10. I was ready to go home. We have sailed 6 or 7 times with Carnival and never had any of these issues. I think I’ll be going back!

A couple nights ago I had a talk with Sam, my husband, and cried my eyeballs out. He listened and offered support. We talked for a couple hours I bet. He reminded me that all I could do is focus on him and the kids. He said, “I need you. The kids need you.” “I’m not going to push you but I’m not going to stop encouraging you to get out.” 

Later that night, I decided to book a flight to join my kids on their visit to see my Mom in Arizona. “My kids need me” and I need to focus on them. In fact my mom needs me too. And going to see her will feel like a reprieve from awkward encounters with everyone around here. It was a decision that I felt proud of; instead of “passing the buck” of taking care of my kids onto someone else, I could make memories with them. Take them to the water park  they love. Wake up early and skate like last year while I was going through IOP. 

The next morning, I sent an apology text to Irene for missing Memorial Day dinner. She had invited the family over but I wasn’t feeling up to it so they went without me. Sam covered for me, said I was sick and while that’s technically true, the reality is that I’ve been sick in bed with depression since September. Sleeping endlessly. On a good day I was watching 8-12 hrs of reality TV. 

Anyway, Irene shared that there was a long time where she never left the house. I cried because I felt seen. I told her that everyone in my life knows what happened when I was manic last Summer, and I can’t shield myself from the embarrassment, guilt, and shame when I see other people so I just want to hide. She said so many encouraging and supportive things like “don’t put pressure on yourself to snap out of it. “Everyone knows. It happened 🤷‍♀️… it’s done, you can’t go back and change it.” “We all mistakes and have issues.” 

All of a sudden I had courage. I sent an apology to my neighbors the next day for my behavior in Summer. I didn’t hear back from everyone but I did hear from A, K and T. I felt heard and supported. More on that later I guess. Afterward I called my Mom and told her about my apology, while crying, and that I was coming to Arizona. She was so excited. 

Today I woke up around 9:30 and thought “I wouldn’t mind getting out of bed.” What a fucking miracle. 

Thank goodness because it’s the first day of Summer for the kids. We had agreed to try going Bowling today. So I got up, made coffee for the first time in a whiiillllllleee, drank it, showered (still skipping makeup and hair), and took them bowling.  

I was able to coach my son through feeling bad about not bowling very well. He was pouting real bad but I chatted with him and tickled him and a couple minutes later he was back to his silly self! Mom win, y’all. At dinner he said bowling was the best part of the day. 

I need to get some sleep. Oh but I was gonna say… 
Feeling good feels a lot like mania. Isn’t it scary? Yes. Yes it is. But I’m taking my meds this time, and I’m stone-cold sober and have been for two years. 

So hopefully I don’t slide back into mania. I hope I don’t sink back into depression. Bipolar is a bitch.

I Regret It.,"I have to be incredibly careful with what I say here. Not just because of the NDA I signed with one of the biggest names in gaming, but because what I'm about to share is one of the darkest secrets a billion-dollar company could possibly bury. And I fear the consequences might be worse than a pack of hungry lawyers clawing down my door.

Honestly, I never planned to speak on any of this. In my mind, it was always meant to stay buried. One of the skeletons we take to the grave, you know? *Maybe* it'd come out to a longtime partner or some random at a bar. But for the most part? I fully expected to keep all of this to myself.

Things have changed. Drastically.

A few months back, I was lurking on a few boards and came across a rumor that this particular gaming studio was developing a new project. By rule, I typically avoided anything related to this gaming studio, so it had been a while since I had seen any associated news. I suppose that when I did see the community buzzing, it sparked a mild curiosity.

This goes without saying, but most online rumors are entirely false, regardless of the conversation around them. However, anyone with a nerdy niche interest knows that if you're in the right circles, there's always someone who seems to know just a little bit more than everyone else. And confirmation from one of these types of people led me on a wild goose chase for more information.

While I didn't find much beyond hints at what might be in development, I came across a comment that halted my research.

The comment read: ""I'm surprised \[the gaming company\] is still around. Does anyone else recall the disturbing stunt they pulled at their offices years ago? They never addressed it and continued on like nothing happened after seriously traumatizing people. Seriously. Stop buying their games.""

It was odd at the moment. I could feel my heartbeat rapidly increasing in my chest. I kept re-reading the comment over and over because there was no way he was referring to what I thought he was referring to.

Five, ten, fifteen minutes later, I'm still looking at the comment. Trying to deny what I knew had to be true.

But why was I reacting like that? I had seen the company's name and watched playthroughs of their game? Hell, I was doing research on them myself. Why was I reacting like this?

Only now, on reflection, do I realize it's not about them. It's not even about me. Not really. It's in the understanding that the experience was a shared one. Not just my trauma but the widespread silent trauma of everyone who had been there.

We saw something collectively, and the fact that it wasn't just me or one or two other people made it so much more real. And even more so... We were all so scared that every single person had been forced into silence.

I quickly typed out a reply for the commenter to message me. Not good enough. After deleting the comment, I messaged them directly, hoping and praying for a response.

Almost immediately after I did, they replied with a simple ""F--- off"" and blocked me.

Great.

I spent the next few weeks looking to see if anyone else had said anything similar. My life was comprised of going to work, ordering takeout, and scouring the internet for someone else who had come forward. Nothing.

And in the midst of all of this. I got a call. One that sent me spiraling. It reignited images of that day so vivid I often feel as though they're burned into my psyche.

The following nightmares have woken me up in cold sweats on multiple occasions.

So here I am, telling a story roughly a decade old. I apologize if anyone was looking for a grand adventure or a philosophical lesson. This isn't that. Just a story of a terrified man who understands that telling you this may be the only way I can cope.

That's all I'm asking for at this point. I don't need a solution or even for those responsible to face justice. I just want to be able to sleep peacefully again.

So, there I was again, lurking on forums. This one, in particular, was dedicated to one of the most anticipated titles of the time from the aforementioned gaming studio. Exciting life, I know.

I rarely talked on forums. But whenever I did, I'd usually get replies from the same few accounts. Most of it was innocuous, and nothing I've committed to memory. I suppose that day was unique.

At that point, we were still far enough away from release that there wasn't a whole lot of information out yet. So I did what any delusional person would do: I asked the board if anyone knew someone with inside info. Gameplay, mechanics, plans for the story... I didn't care. I just wanted something to enhance the excitement I was already feeling in the fear that my curiosity would grow painfully unbearable.

Hours passed, and disappointingly, my question was lost in the sea of random conversation. It's not the first time, but this one stung a bit extra.

I slept, thought nothing of it, and woke up to a familiar notification the next day. It was one of the accounts that had often replied to me.

When I checked the forum, he had responded to my post with a simple ""Yes"" and a link.

Curious but excited, I cautiously clicked on it to see what they had sent me. I was greeted by this bland-looking flyer. My eyes widened as I read the headline, ""Meet & Greet with the Dev Team"" along with the company logo and the title of the upcoming game.

I nearly gasped when I finished reading the words. Here was my chance. I could meet the team behind the game and get some inside information on their plans. Hell, maybe I could even bring some of the most-asked questions from the forum back and really make an impression on people. Anything to get those meaningless internet points.

And wouldn't you know it? They were setting up shop pretty close, and tickets were relatively cheap. Back then, I assumed that dev teams only met fans at huge cons or launch parties, if they did at all. Never before a game was even released. But I wasn't complaining.

In the end, I figured it was perhaps something to stir up some hype. It's not unusual for PR teams to devise innovative ways to connect with the public. And hey, maybe the team leaked a rumor or two to one of the participants, who then spread it around, and now there's a newfound interest in your game.

It's wrong as hell now, but that's how I rationalized it in my mind.

The day of the meet-and-greet arrives, and I'm headed over. My expectation is to pull into a GameStop  or some other cleared-out lot with tons of fanfare. Maybe there would be signing booths, different stations, mascots, you know? The whole thing.

Instead, I pull into a relatively mundane set of office buildings. At first, I wasn't sure if I was very early or being pranked because there was no way an official event wouldn't have hundreds of people there. Especially given that I live near a very populous city.

Looking out my window, I finally spot a decent-sized line of people coming out of one of the buildings and several unremarkable signs lazily pointing toward where the meet-and-greet is taking place.

Side note. If you're looking to crush the spirit of anyone attending your event, just don't try. Seriously. No effort is almost always worse than a bad effort. At least the latter shows you care.

Anyway, remarkably less enthused, I made my way over to the line and waited. And waited. The most interesting part was the small talk with the organizers and some of the other waiting people. Not only that, but the line moved so slowly... If I hadn't been really committed to meeting the devs, I likely would have just walked away.

I mostly stayed on my phone during my wait, but the few times I glanced up, something caught my eye.

Every person who left seemed out of place. I don't know how to describe my feelings at the time. I think at first, I thought they were all depressed.

At first, I assumed it was just general disappointment. But the more I observed, the more they seemed genuinely sad. A good portion of those who left were crying. Total strangers would exchange silent hugs. There was just this heaviness that I couldn't perceive.

Little did I know that was a sneak peek at what was to come. My attention was immediately caught as I shifted my focus to the front door.

At first, I thought I was being deluded. I had to be. But the more I watched, the more I noticed that not everyone who went inside came back out. You wouldn't see it at a glance. The frequency was irregular. Masterfully so. Just a few people vanishing here and there, never enough to trigger alarm. Maybe they stayed for an extra autograph? Maybe there was a back door? Rational questions.

What's harder to rationalize is why they never returned to the only available parking lot. How many confused office workers glanced at them and quietly wondered? How many people were tasked with removing them and brushed off the creeping question: *Where did the owners go?* The thought of the empty cars sitting there, waiting for someone who would never return... It bugs me. I still get the ick when I see a car that's been sitting empty in one spot for too long.

After what felt like forever, I finally made it to the front of the line. A guy in oversized sunglasses gave me a lazy nod toward the office entrance.

The moment I stepped inside, I got hit with a blast of cold air. One of their hit game soundtracks was playing through some cheap, blown-out speakers, filling the space with tinny noise. Behind a desk sat a balding clerk, half-buried in a sea of paperwork with a few suspicious cans lying about.

Off to the side stood a single orange door. Taped to the frame was a scrap of paper with the poorly written words ""Dev Team.""

I glanced around, expecting more before mentally chastising myself, given how the rest of the event had gone. Couldn't exactly expect much more than what I was seeing. Aside from a dusty life-size cutout of one of their big-name characters, the room was depressingly bare. No merch. No excited fans. No energy. Just recycled air, bad music, and the sense that maybe this wasn't worth the $40.

We exchanged a few awkward hellos, and he slid a thick stack of paperwork my way. By then, I had already begun to feel that I no longer wanted to do this. But I'd come all this way. Spent the gas. Took the day off. At that point, it made more sense to just get it over with.

I signed the forms and returned them. He took them, looked down, and hesitated. Then he let out a deep sigh and rubbed his temples.

""Long day, man?"" I asked him, trying to keep it light.

He stared at me longer than necessary, then let out a short, tired laugh. ""Yeah. Long day,"" he said before rattling off a canned spiel about NDAs and basic rules. Then he pointed toward the orange door, plastered a half-hearted smile on his face, and said, ""Good luck.""

Ready to get my answers and promptly leave, I walk toward the door and give the man behind the desk, who had now moved to silently playing on his phone, one final half-smile.

Touching the doorknob was like plunging my hand into dry ice. An instant, burning cold made me yank back with a gasp while instinctively shooting a look at the guy behind the desk. My shocked and angry expression spoke for me.

He glanced up, gave me a lazy shrug, and went right back to scrolling on his phone.

I wrapped my sleeve around my hand and tried again, gripping the cold metal through the fabric. This time, the door creaked open.

Inside, shadows swallowed everything. The only light came from the sickly blue glow of scattered computer monitors.

As I stepped in, the door clicked shut behind me. The awful music from the lobby vanished, smothered by thick silence broken only by a low electrical hum and a slight burning smell.

""...H-Hello?"" I called out, my words eaten by the dark.

I like to consider myself a rational person. I knew from the jump that this whole experience was off, and whatever *this* was, it set my danger signals to one hundred.

I spun back toward the door and reached for the knob—only to recoil again. It was colder now. Not just cold—biting. My fingers stung on contact like I'd touched dry steel in a snowstorm. I forced myself to try again. It didn't budge.

I swore under my breath and pounded on the door. ""Hey! Hey!""

Nothing.

I hit it again, harder this time—desperate now—but no answer came. I tried again. Nothing. Like a caged animal, I pulled and twisted, hoping I could tear down the only thing keeping me from safety. But with each failed attempt, the cold reality sank in that I was alone. The hum and the dark were my only company.

I let out a frustrated scream into the nothing before turning to face the dark room again. My eyes strained, hunting for some other way out—anything that wasn't a dead end. I crept toward the soft glow of one of the computer screens, moving slowly when my shin knocked into something solid.

I froze.

Reaching out, my fingers brushed against the back of something hard. Cautiously, I felt around the object until my mind pieced together what it was from the little light in the room. It was a chair.

Figuring maybe I could use it to reach a vent or something, I swirled the object toward me and before I even had time to process why, I was already falling back hard onto the floor.

Someone was sitting in it. Slumped, still, almost posed.

The dim monitor light cast a sickly blue glow over his face, but it wasn't the screen that drew my eye.

It was his mouth.

It hung unnaturally wide—distended, broken-looking—and from within, a striped red-and-blue light spun like a siren buried in his throat. The flickering cast shadows across his gaunt face, dancing over skin pulled tight to the bone. Whatever fat or muscle he'd once had was long gone. He looked... consumed. Like he'd been starved from the inside out.

His hands gripped the arms of the chair so tightly they seemed fused to it—flesh sunken, knuckles bone-white, fingernails blackened.

His clothes hung off him in tatters, dusted in long strands of white hair that looked like they'd once belonged to a full head of shoulder-length hair.

But it was his eyes... Or... The absence of them—that made my breath catch.

His eye sockets gaped impossibly wide, empty but surgically clean. Not a drop of blood, not a shred of tissue. Just polished hollows where his eyes should've been.

And yet, somehow, they weren't empty.

Because inside each socket, suspended in the void, spun another light—identical to the one in his mouth. Red and blue. Rotating. Silent. Hypnotic.

I found myself staring. Trapped in those pits. Caught in the endless cycle of color and motion. I don’t know how long I was lost there, only that I snapped out of it with a sharp slap to my own face. Then I kicked the corpse away from me, hard.

My breathing turned erratic. My thoughts were a storm of confusion and panic.

I had to find a way out. Now.

I shot to my feet, fumbling for my phone, and flicked on the flashlight, desperately looking for another way out, but nearly dropped it when something on the man's monitor caught my attention.

Lines of code were appearing on the screen. Then vanishing. Then reappearing. As if someone were typing and deleting in real time.

I moved to the next workstation. Another body. Same position. Same spinning lights.

Code was being written there as well. I moved to the next. And the next.

Every screen. Every corpse. Every one of them still writing.

I’m no game developer, but I couldn’t stop myself from looking closer. Even with my limited understanding, it was clear—this was game code.

Someone had to see this. I hit record and made a second round, capturing all of the bodies and their workstations, hoping that as soon as I got out, I'd take it to everyone I could think of. The police, friends, and family. Hell, I would drive to the state capital and show it to the governor if I had to. Whatever was happening here couldn't be kept a secret.

And then, the silence broke.

It was subtle—barely there. In any other setting, I might’ve missed it entirely.

The faintest sound of an inhale.

I turned toward the sound, my heart hammering against my ribs. One of them—the one nearest to me—its jaw twitched. A tiny, grotesque motion, like it was struggling to open wider, to pull in more air.

I stepped closer.

The mouth opened further, joints clicking. The breath came again—deeper this time.

They were breathing.

I turned on my phone's flashlight, desperately looking around the room for a way out.

And the lights... God, the lights...

The lights in their eyes started spinning faster. The speed increasing in sync with the breaths. It was like they were waking up.

I turned my phone's flashlight back on and swept it across the room, panic now in full bloom. There had to be another way out—there had to be.

But the walls were bare. No windows. No vents. I was alone with the glowing screens and breathing corpses.

I turned and bolted back to the door.

I grabbed the knob again, but this time, the cold was even deeper. It burned my skin, but I didn't let go. I couldn't. All the while, I'm banging and screaming at the top of my lungs.

""Please, for the love of God, HELP me!""

**Bang. Bang. Bang.**

The breaths were growing deeper, heavier. I knew I was running out of time.

I slammed my fists against the door, harder, faster. From behind me, I heard it—the soft creak of old chairs turning in unison.

**Bang. Bang.**

“Help!” I screamed. Desperate. Raw.

A wet cough echoed from the room. One of the corpses was waking up.

They were coming.

“Goddammit!” I yelled.

And then—

Daylight.

I flew out the tiny crack, turning for a final glance just in time to see one of the corpses illuminated by the light, its neck cracking as it fully rotated toward me. Its jaw popped as it attempted to communicate. And then, in a loud whisper that didn't match the movement of its mouth, it spoke.

Standing above me was the man from the front desk, arms crossed, face twisted with barely concealed annoyance, like I'd spilled coffee on his favorite keyboard.

""Alright. That's enough,"" he said flatly. ""You need to leave.""

I scrambled upright, gasping, trying to piece together a coherent sentence—anything to make him understand. I babbled about the bodies, the lights, the breathing, the code.

He held up a finger to his lips and then pointed at the door. All while giving me a look that clearly stated, ""You're crazy.""

I stared back, confused. How could he not get it? I wasn't crazy. I had seen what I saw. The man himself was mere feet from the door. And if others were experiencing the same thing within minutes of each other, I'd imagine all of them would be as disturbed as I am. So... What the hell?

At first, I didn't want to leave. I couldn't leave. There were people in there who clearly needed help. And I'd already seen others go in and never come out. I begged the man to listen.

That's when two large guys materialized out of nowhere and physically removed me from the building. No discussion.

Later, I got a text. No pleasantries—just a reminder that everything I saw and heard that day was protected under the NDA I signed. And a warning that this company had no qualms about launching life-ruining lawsuits to protect its secrets.

At first, I didn't care. What I had recorded clearly crossed a line—this wasn't just a breach of contract but a serious criminal offense.

Then, I tried to check the footage.

Corrupted. Every file.

Of course.

The only thing left was to call the police. I lied. Said there were sick people inside, possibly in danger. But I didn't stick around. I couldn't bring myself to be there when they showed up.

To this day, as far as I know, there's never been a news story. No investigation. No PR nightmare for the company. Only silence.

I wish I could take anything from any of this. As far as I know, I don't have clinical depression. But I felt like I was right there for a couple of months.

The game eventually came out to great reviews, and of course, I couldn't bring myself to play it. Or any of their other games, for that matter.

It's weird. You'd think any mention of that studio or their IPs would send me into a full-blown panic, but it's not like that. Not at all. I do have this lingering dread that follows. But it's almost like my abject fear is stuck in that place. Or rather, with that place.

I mean, hell, I don't even know if whatever I experienced has anything to do with the studio in question. To that point, I conducted research on who was involved with the actual game, and none of the names of the development team that I allegedly met were listed.

But still. They were coding something, right? I mean, I saw them building a game.

I think of all this. The thing I think back on most was when the last corpse turned to me. He said something that was undeniably the most true thing I know about this situation.

He said, ""I'm in hell.""

Whoever you are or were, I'm sorry.

Last thing. And I almost forgot this one. For a while, I was getting these weird calls. At first, I thought they were just promotional robocalls telling me to buy their games because I had been placed on a list somewhere.

One day, I grew tired of the spam and said something less than pleasant on the phone. Immediately, the guy on the other end pauses and tells me, ""Remember to keep your fucking mouth shut."" He proceeded to list off my home address and where I worked at the time. Then, he hung up and for years, he never called back.

It wasn't until after I tried communicating with that random commentor that I finally received another call. The call that set me on the path here today.

He didn't speak for long. He didn't need to. I'll remember his words forever. He said, ""You almost broke your silence. It's too bad. We know you have great eyes for gaming. Next time, we'll use them.""

To this day, I don't know what to do with that.

Before anyone asks, no, I'm not saying the location of the offices or releasing any information about anything. I just... Can't. Even if I could, I don't believe anyone should be digging into this.

Honestly, I wish I could end this off with something... I don't know. Important? Meaningful? However, I don't have anything to offer. Like I said earlier, I'm just a scared guy who needed to vent. However, I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this.

At the very least, I can offer you this parting piece of advice. Be really careful which doors you step through. You never know what you'll find on the other side.",12,1748573478.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I was recently commissioned by a host of a politics/economics podcast to draw a YouTube thumbnail for one of their episodes. The theme was Trump’s “big beautiful bill” so they wanted me to reference the bill from the schoolhouse rock episode in a “bloated” state as a caricature of the actual bill.

I was confused why they chose me tbh, my background is a furry inflation artist but I guess one of the hosts (probably the bald one?) knew me from my previous work. Nevertheless I am always up for a challenge and drawing for my loyal followers so I got to work. I used my inflation skills to draw the inflated bill, making sure to add all of the juicy and scrumptious details. 

However, when the episode was uploaded tons of comments derided my art as “weird” and “insane”. I believed the host would back me up as he was the one who described the thumbnail in such detail, but instead he changed it into a generic thumbnail of a photo of trump. Once I confronted him about this he got very angry. Since then he has been spamming me with threatening pictures of his face superimposed onto what appears to be a dining utensils that it crashed my internet. He has also made threats that he would find out where I live and quote “drown me in a sea of coffee”.

Trying to diagnose the issue, we move it to a sunnier window in the bathroom. Shortly, the leaves began to scald. We moved it to the kitchen with less light, now it is no longer burned but now the poor thing looks very sick. Leaves are beginning to loose shine, look veiny, before becoming yellow and falling off. It certainly has gone through a lot and is struggling with something more. The current window it is in now gets good, indirect light with a little bright sunrise ray and is rotated fairly regularly. The environment is not unlike when it was thriving here- my instinct says it might have become root bound or have some sort of rot for one reason or another.

Details are: 

- 1st date was coffee for an hour, cut short because I had to go to a house inspection afterwards. 2nd date was a wine bar for 2.5 hours, we had work the next day so didn’t go that late. Easy conversation (although some awkward silences still) and heaps in common. This is less time than the first date with both ex boyfriends which worries me a bit, as those felt more natural/romantic. My last boyfriend, we’d already kissed, texted a lot and cuddled by the 3rd date.
- There were parts of the 2nd date where I felt super attracted to him/butterflies but then other parts where I really didn’t. This has never happened to me before.
- We haven’t had much physical contact on either date (apart from hello/goodbye hugs) but he was leaning closer to me at the wine bar and said he definitely wants to see me again at the end of our 2nd date. We don’t text that much between dates which is unlike my exes too, where I got really excited about messages. 
- I’m stressed because sometimes I did want to kiss him (I also miss physical closeness) but other times I really didn’t/the idea of it stressed me out. 

My last relationship: 
I was blindsided by a breakup before this (2yr relationship ended 1yr 4months ago - avoidant ex) which hit me really hard. I’ve done therapy and all the stuff you’re supposed to do. I’m craving intimacy (and know it’s been a while) but also feel scared at the idea of it which is frustrating.

I’m stressed because my last 2 boyfriends, I had zero doubts about from first meeting them. I instantly wanted them and things flowed very easily. Texting/banter was better with both of them also. But they were also more “smooth”, very forward and maybe too ‘player-ish’. They both had commitment issues and I feel saw relationships as replaceable because getting women is easy for them. This guy is more introverted and not forward at all. 

Tl;dr Should I give it a 3rd date or is my confusion/lack of excitement about this current guy a bad sign?

I’ve never been in-between those feelings with someone before and I can’t help comparing to my exes which felt different in the beginning, even if they didn’t work out.

I’ve been drowning in disposable coffee pods for way too long, feeling guilty about the waste and annoyed by the cost. Then I found these reusable coffee pods made specifically for the Ninja Dual Brew and Dual Brew Pro, and honestly, it’s been a game-changer. The stainless steel mesh filter makes a smooth cup without the gritty bits, and the BPA-free plastic keeps things safe without messing with the flavor.

Filling them up is super simple thanks to the wide opening, and the snap-tight lid means zero leaks while brewing. Cleanup is just as easy, you can rinse them under the tap or toss them in the dishwasher without a second thought. Whether I want a bold or mellow brew, these pods handle both perfectly and fit all the settings on my machine.

They’re lightweight and durable too, so I take them everywhere, home, office, even travel. If you’re tired of tossing pods and spending too much, give these a shot. Saving money and the planet? Win-win.

DICLAIMER:: This is a fictional/confessional story I generated for fun — not a real experience.

I don’t really use Reddit, but my wife said I should write this down because she hasn’t stopped laughing since I told her.

Anyway. I’m a department manager at a mid-sized marketing firm. I’m in my early 50s, been in the game for over 25 years, and I like to think I’ve seen it all. I deal with everything from interns ghosting on their second day to clients sending feedback in Comic Sans. Nothing surprises me anymore.

Or so I thought.

So yesterday, I’m sitting at my desk at home, quietly sipping my coffee, catching up on Slack messages, when my phone buzzes. It’s a text from one of my employees, let’s call him Jake (not his real name, obviously). Great guy, solid worker, a little too fond of emojis in professional emails but otherwise dependable.

I glance at the preview, expecting something like “Hey, quick question about the client deck.” Instead, I see:

“Mmm, I can’t wait to peel that off you tonight. You better not wear anything under it. 😈🔥🍆”

At first I just… stared at it. Thought maybe it was some weird spam or maybe he got hacked.

Nope. Sent directly from his number. My work phone. My professional line. With the eggplant emoji. The goddamn eggplant emoji.

Now, I’ve got a pretty good poker face, but I swear to God I made this full-body noise like a dying accordion. I dropped my pen. My coffee sloshed. My dog looked at me like “You good?” I was not good.

Then, two minutes later, a follow-up:

“OH MY GOD. I am so sorry, that was meant for my girlfriend. Deeply inappropriate. I sincerely apologize. Please disregard.”

What can you even do in that situation?

I sat there, feeling 47 different kinds of secondhand embarrassment. I didn’t want to make it worse by joking about it (because what if he’s freaking out?), but I also didn’t want to be cold and make him feel like I was preparing to fire him or report him to HR.

So I just replied with the most neutral, corporate dad message I could muster:

“Please be more careful with your messages in the future. Also, I would prefer not to receive eggplant emojis from my staff.”

And then I immediately walked out of my office, looked at my wife and said, “I think I just got sexted by Jake.”

She’s been calling me “babe” and sending me eggplant emojis ever since.

Today we had our regular one-on-one on Zoom. Poor guy looked like he hadn’t slept. His eyes darted everywhere except at the camera. I said “Let’s keep it professional” at one point — about a completely unrelated topic — and I could see him die a little inside.

Anyway. I’m not mad. I’m not even really weirded out. Just… exhausted. Being a manager in 2025 means half your job is doing actual work, and the other half is accidentally becoming a side character in someone’s romantic comedy gone wrong.

If nothing else, I’ve now been sent an unsolicited sext and an eggplant emoji by someone who once gave a 10-minute presentation on ad retargeting.

1kyt6ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/DallasStars/comments/1kyt6ju/hat_tip_to_your_community_from_a_kraken_fan_not/,Hat tip to your community from a Kraken fan. (<-- not game related),"I was really impressed by the way your community rallied to honor Scheifele's late father, and for the Ben Stelter Foundation fundraiser before that (following the La Bamba incident). You have my respect and appreciation for these gestures. It speaks to the character of this community, especially considering the depth of the rivalries (especially with Edmonton). Nicely done, y'all.

 The thing is, I already knew this about r/DallasStars. Two years ago, the Kraken faced the Stars in the second round of the playoffs, and instead of the usual adversarial, toxic back-and-forth between subreddits that you'd expect in any given series, our respective subreddits did it differently. It started with[ this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DallasStars/comments/135nba6/kraken_fan_here_made_this_to_kick_off_the_second/) (still funny), and continued with a lighthearted, respectful, often silly banter between our subs that really embodied good sportsmanship and healthy rivalry. The entire series marked a good moment in time that I'll always remember fondly. For anyone that was here for that series, let me just keep the PG-rated trash talking going: IF ANY OF YOU SCOUNDREL STARS FANS EVEN THINK OF VISITING THE SEATTLE AREA, BE WARNED WE'LL HAPPILY MEET UP WITH YOU AND BUY YOU A BEER/COFFEE/MILK.

 So, in the spirit of respect, comradery, and good taste in sports, I made a Dallas Stars puck display model, intended for 3D printing. It's the second in a series (apparently!) that started with the Kraken display shown. Each face is separated for easy multi-color printing, but the relief I've added to the logo's facets means that it'll have some definition if printed in one color. The display *should* be free-standing without feet (with the puck in the display, the center of mass is just right), but I've included small feet to be printed separately if necessary. The model is [available on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7052093). Brand color codes[ available here (link to PDF)](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_document/prd/fnfrr6spowanebh2oqr0.pdf) for those looking to get the right filaments.

\[edit\] The pics aren't showing up on mobile, which is irritating. The Thingiverse post has pics (and if you're interested, the Kraken model will be under my profile link).

1kyt1dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1kyt1dt/freezing_for_apparently_no_reason/,Freezing for apparently no reason,"Hey everyone, I'm at my wits end. I'll go over my freezing experience in detail.

Before you ask, yes, I use mods.

TLDR; The first time I had freezes I tried everything and in the end deleting outpost links fixed it. Now freezing is back from nowhere and I can't seem to fix it.

The detailed version:

A few days ago I managed to solve a freezing issue that had made me quit playing the game entirely. The game would freeze every minute or so for 10+ seconds, with CPU usage dropping to 0%. Saving the game also caused it to freeze for a few seconds and took way longer than usual (10-15 seconds per save, even quicksaves, plus throwing the ""Starfield is not responding"" for a few seconds until it finished saving).

Every thread I came across either recommended limiting CPU usage, cleaning save bloat, deleting excess save files, reinstalling, checking drivers, etc. I tried basically everything, including upgrading my PC pretty substantially (way better CPU, 16gb of extra ram, new cooler in case it was thermal throttling).

In the end, it ended up being an issue with having complex cargo links and outpost extractor-storage links. which nobody had mentioned until I randomly found a thread talking about it. I deleted the landing pads and one outpost and it instantly fixed itself. I happily returned to playing as normal. The time it took to save the game also dropped dramatically.

A couple hours ago, however, I was playing as I'd been for the last few days, doing the Deserted Trade Authority spacer cleanup mission, when suddenly the game froze as it used to before the outpost fix. Saving the game also takes longer now, like it used to before I fixed it.

I instantly tried deleting my production outpost but that didn't change anything. I passed an in game month in Venus and that didn't change anything either. I deleted my other outpost (no resource production, just buildings) as well and that didn't fix anything either. I manually cleared DX shaders, and that didn't fix anything. I removed **BlueprintShips-Starfield.esm** as a dependency on all flagged mods, and it did nothing.

It's not thermal throttling, it's not CPU usage over 100% (it consistently stays below 50%), it's not outdated drivers, it's not from the new update since I haven't updated so as not to risk breaking my mods, and I heavily doubt it's save bloating as I cleaned my saves not that long ago and the files are \~25mb in size, and it's not too many save files either as it still happens with 2 save files total.

I'm slowly losing my mind.

If any of you has a suggestion, no matter how trivial, simple, or outlandish it may sound, please share it. I'm willing to cast spells at my PC if needed. Seriously, I'm desperate.

Thanks in advance.

1kyt0pl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Puppyblues/comments/1kyt0pl/guidance_needed_in_my_newly_rehomed_10_month_old/,Guidance needed in my newly rehomed 10 month old puppy,"Hi All!
I’m looking for any kind advice or guidance on a 10 month old Maltese x Shitzu x Bichon  I brought home on Monday that was needing to be rehomed, I’m going to get a professional trainer in and keep working with him but I wanted honest advice on whether another environment might be better for him given his background and needs.

I realised on the day I took him, and it’s becoming even more apparent that the owners didn’t understand him and his needs very well and haven’t been upfront about everything. They had previously rehomed him for one night the week prior but ended up taking him back because the guy was a creep (long story). So I figured he wasn’t in the right home and they clearly weren’t vetting people correctly so I would take him regardless as I know I was a better fit than the current owners. Their reason for rehoming is that he was escaping through their fencing and their landlord will not fix/amend their fencing (however after seeing the fencing they could’ve put mesh and cable ties to cover the space he was escaping from). For context he was adopted when he was about 9 weeks old as a puppy and they’ve said they think he was the runt of the litter. His previous owners live on a 2 acre property with a massive house and four young kids and another large dog which they failed to tell me about till I went to see him - I didn’t see a strong emotional bond with the dog but now I do believe the other dog was providing him with some sort of emotional regulation by presence. Before I went there I asked a lot of questions back and forth to ensure I was a good fit and if he would need to perhaps go to a bigger space. They said he was a chill dog, loved people and other dogs, saw everyone as a friend and didn’t need further training, socialised well. I was told he doesn’t get separation anxiety and is fine being left alone at home. Which is all untrue and he barely knows sit. They also never took him for walks because he would just run around outside when his owners were out there and that he hasn’t  destroy anything within the home. He won’t nap during the day unless I’m laying down and not moving around so I assumed that was also the same his last place so he was just outside and following his owners around all day, not sleeping. To also add, the owner told me two different birthdays that were incorrect, his microchip is still registered to the breeders and they said he was 2kg when he’s 6.5kg.

I am in my mid thirties and live alone in a one bedroom apartment with access to a large grassed courtyard area that he needs to remain on lead for due to strata and also other people/dogs who have access to courtyard. I also never realised till I brought him home how loud the traffic was, but I have continuous ASMR puppy music on. I have time to invest in him now but I also feel like I can’t leave my apartment because it’s too much for him.
I need to start uni in August which needs my full attention and will take a lot out of me as I also have ADHD and in November I need to visit a relative via plane who is elderly and this might be the last time I see them so I will need him to stay with someone or get someone to stay here. I’m extremely burnt out right now, which has reduced my appetite and made me sick which rarely happens. Overall I have a lot of love to give but I’m a very independent person - calm, rest, downtime and a clean space are an essential for me.

Yesterday it was almost like he was regressing and he’s started wincing, tearing up coffee table books, clawing at my couch, jumping up onto my dining table etc. I feel a bit stupid because I set my space up for a dog that is chill and trained rather than a dog that is very sensitive, has been both under stimulated and overstimulated and needs boundaries and structure and I feel like a bit of an idiot and that I’ve let us both down. He’s also not toileting as regularly as he should be yet but I’ve managed to get him to go a few times in the courtyard on lead, and he went to pee by the front door overnight last night which is the first time he’s gone inside (Had a vet check up, nothing medical going on). I take him to toilet/walk in the courtyard area but sometimes he gets overstimulated by the sounds and smells as it can be different every time if people are on their balconies. I finally got a bit of sleep for the first time last night. He does sleep in my room and actually is pretty good with sleeping in the night but jumped up on me wanting to play and lick this morning at 5am so I redirected him to calm behaviour.  

I put on an adaptil collar last night so I hope that might actually help, I’ve brought in a playpen but haven’t enforced anything yet, but will slowly start to get him used to the area with nourishment, treats etc. It’s not enclosed yet but I’m using it as a barrier to the front door and to stop him wincing and clawing at the door.
Do you think it’s too late to try and get him crate trained? I don’t know if he’ll see this as a punishment as he’s always had free roam of space.
I know he’s decompressing and things take time but this poor little guy has lots of emotions and is very sensitive. As I’ve said I am getting a trainer in and know that will take time but wanted honest opinions if he’s better to be rehomed somewhere with less traffic, another well behaved dog for co regulation when owners aren’t home and access to a backyard where he can go to the toilet and run around freely when he wants to. I’m willing to do whatever is best for him.
Please be kind with responses!

“You gotta be kidding me! You who ruined the last simulation with all your bot roleplayers that RUINED the illusion and cost a dozen people to lose their gambling bets,” the detective snipes bitterly.  He holds up his electric dog catching net to show the Bride he means business.


“Oh yes, sir, I’m hear to tell you that the Smileys are going to release another wave of the virus.  Go ahead and kill me off, it won’t stop it you’ll see. The replication already began.”

The Bride lost patience and shapeshifts to dog.  “I’m a real bitch so deal with it. Woof woof,” she barks knowing the detective will use his dog catcher net to kill her simulation.

“You gotta be kidding me,” screams the detective. 

The Bride in dog form speaks, “...more severe measures will be implemented according to the Compound.  You have not understood having fun, detective.”

The Bride as the Dog bites the detective  in the pants.  

The detective hits here with his electric dog catcher and ends The Brides simulation. “Take the red pill,” he screams hitting her in so much slow motion that he earns fifty ghost coins. 


The Brides ghost rises up alive but this time as deadly wafting stench to speak to the detective, “the next wave of the virus will infect the audience with anal retention. Extreme gas pain will occur from them holding in sharts.  Nothing you do can save them.”

The Bride as a Ghost speaks directly to the detective’s camera.  She knows the detective is televising this for the gamblers watching.  

“You can place a bounty on my head, fellows.  But I am everywhere.”


“I am Chaos,” she sings, “I am the infinite order spawning.  See me sprawling?  Try to escape me.  You can’t.  I am mercury in your fingers. I am the anus, the mouth and the endless black hole shitting.  I poot on you.  I am Chaos magic.”

1kysxy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maltese/comments/1kysxy4/guidance_needed_in_my_newly_rehomed_10_month_old/,Guidance needed in my newly rehomed 10 month old puppy,"Hi All!
I’m looking for any kind advice or guidance on a 10 month old Maltese x Shitzu x Bichon  I brought home on Monday that was needing to be rehomed, I’m going to get a professional trainer in and keep working with him but I wanted honest advice on whether another environment might be better for him given his background and needs.

I realised on the day I took him, and it’s becoming even more apparent that the owners didn’t understand him and his needs very well and haven’t been upfront about everything. They had previously rehomed him for one night the week prior but ended up taking him back because the guy was a creep (long story). So I figured he wasn’t in the right home and they clearly weren’t vetting people correctly so I would take him regardless as I know I was a better fit than the current owners. Their reason for rehoming is that he was escaping through their fencing and their landlord will not fix/amend their fencing (however after seeing the fencing they could’ve put mesh and cable ties to cover the space he was escaping from). For context he was adopted when he was about 9 weeks old as a puppy and they’ve said they think he was the runt of the litter. His previous owners live on a 2 acre property with a massive house and four young kids and another large dog which they failed to tell me about till I went to see him - I didn’t see a strong emotional bond with the dog but now I do believe the other dog was providing him with some sort of emotional regulation by presence. Before I went there I asked a lot of questions back and forth to ensure I was a good fit and if he would need to perhaps go to a bigger space. They said he was a chill dog, loved people and other dogs, saw everyone as a friend and didn’t need further training, socialised well. I was told he doesn’t get separation anxiety and is fine being left alone at home. Which is all untrue and he barely knows sit. They also never took him for walks because he would just run around outside when his owners were out there and that he hasn’t  destroy anything within the home. He won’t nap during the day unless I’m laying down and not moving around so I assumed that was also the same his last place so he was just outside and following his owners around all day, not sleeping. To also add, the owner told me two different birthdays that were incorrect, his microchip is still registered to the breeders and they said he was 2kg when he’s 6.5kg.

I am in my mid thirties and live alone in a one bedroom apartment with access to a large grassed courtyard area that he needs to remain on lead for due to strata and also other people/dogs who have access to courtyard. I also never realised till I brought him home how loud the traffic was, but I have continuous ASMR puppy music on. I have time to invest in him now but I also feel like I can’t leave my apartment because it’s too much for him.
I need to start uni in August which needs my full attention and will take a lot out of me as I also have ADHD and in November I need to visit a relative via plane who is elderly and this might be the last time I see them so I will need him to stay with someone or get someone to stay here. I’m extremely burnt out right now, which has reduced my appetite and made me sick which rarely happens. Overall I have a lot of love to give but I’m a very independent person - calm, rest, downtime and a clean space are an essential for me.

Yesterday it was almost like he was regressing and he’s started wincing, tearing up coffee table books, clawing at my couch, jumping up onto my dining table etc. I feel a bit stupid because I set my space up for a dog that is chill and trained rather than a dog that is very sensitive, has been both under stimulated and overstimulated and needs boundaries and structure and I feel like a bit of an idiot and that I’ve let us both down. He’s also not toileting as regularly as he should be yet but I’ve managed to get him to go a few times in the courtyard on lead, and he went to pee by the front door overnight last night which is the first time he’s gone inside (Had a vet check up, nothing medical going on). I take him to toilet/walk in the courtyard area but sometimes he gets overstimulated by the sounds and smells as it can be different every time if people are on their balconies. I finally got a bit of sleep for the first time last night. He does sleep in my room and actually is pretty good with sleeping in the night but jumped up on me wanting to play and lick this morning at 5am so I redirected him to calm behaviour.  

I put on an adaptil collar last night so I hope that might actually help, I’ve brought in a playpen but haven’t enforced anything yet, but will slowly start to get him used to the area with nourishment, treats etc. It’s not enclosed yet but I’m using it as a barrier to the front door and to stop him wincing and clawing at the door.
Do you think it’s too late to try and get him crate trained? I don’t know if he’ll see this as a punishment as he’s always had free roam of space.
I know he’s decompressing and things take time but this poor little guy has lots of emotions and is very sensitive. As I’ve said I am getting a trainer in and know that will take time but wanted honest opinions if he’s better to be rehomed somewhere with less traffic, another well behaved dog for co regulation when owners aren’t home and access to a backyard where he can go to the toilet and run around freely when he wants to. I’m willing to do whatever is best for him.
Please be kind with responses!

1kysxuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kysxuu/why_does_pretty_privilege_suck_so_much_my_coffee/,Why does pretty privilege suck so much? My coffee shop experience and beyond,"Okay, I just need to get this off my chest because it’s been bugging me for weeks.

So me and my friend always go to this coffee shop. Lately, there’s this guy working there who keeps giving my friend a *medium* iced cappuccino even though she only pays for a *small*. Like, he literally argues with his coworkers and leaves the counter (even with a line behind us!) just to make sure she gets the bigger drink. And me? I always get exactly what I ordered — no extras, no freebies.

Then, another coworker started giving my other pretty friend ( lol) free coffee every single day and even asked for her Instagram. This friend is considered “pretty” by society’s standards, and I think that’s why she’s getting all this special treatment. Meanwhile, my other friend — who’s not “pretty” by those standards — had her order messed up and got a hot cocoa that tasted nasty. Like, the difference is so obvious and it hurts.

I’ve tried to stand up for myself and ask why she gets treated that way, but my friend brushes me off. She says I’m being dramatic or that it’s just because she’s a regular customer. But honestly, I don’t buy it. I think it’s because she fits this narrow idea of “pretty” and that’s why she gets the special treatment.

And here’s the thing : I don’t get that treatment. I get the regular order. No freebies, no special attention. Sometimes, it even feels like I’m invisible or not worth the same kindness just because I don’t fit society’s “pretty” mold. It’s frustrating and it makes me feel uglier sometimes, even though I know I shouldn’t compare myself like that.

It’s not just about coffee. It’s about feeling seen and valued. It’s about how people — especially men treat you differently because of how you look. Even at school, teachers treat the “pretty” white girls differently more attention, more patience, more chances. The rest of us? We’re kinda invisible.

I cry sometimes when I’m frustrated about all this, but I can’t say that out loud because then my friends will think I’m jealous or “too emotional.”They also say that they come there regulary but the so do I and so do my not so pretty friend and we never get anything extra. But it’s not about jealousy or coffee it’s about fairness. It’s about dignity.

Honestly, what I really want is to be *seen* for who I am — not just judged by my looks. I want people to notice me for my kindness, my humor, my effort, and my heart. Is that too much to ask?

If you feel this too  like you’re being overlooked because of how you look, you’re not alone. It really sucks, and it’s okay to be upset about it :( 

  
Edit: Just to clarify, when I said I stood up for myself, I meant I stood up to the **barista**, not my friend. I tried to call out how I was being treated unfairly.  
But when I vented about it later to my friend how hurtful and invisible it made me feel  she just brushed me off and said I was being dramatic.  
That’s the part that really stings. I wasn’t blaming her, I just needed someone to understand. But instead, I was made to feel like my feelings didn’t matter.",10,1748571511.0,offmychest,62,0.56,False

This is Day 1 of my journey to get people to use something I've been building for the last few months.

I'm Shivam , 21, a student from India. I built a web app— it's a place where early-stage founders and students with ideas/projects can find like-minded collaborators or even just get their startup idea validated.

I didn't have a network, co-founders, or any support when I started. So I built something I wish I had:

A space where your idea doesn’t die alone in your notes app.


It's raw. It's real. It’s not perfect, but it works — onboarding, posting, matching, chatting — all live.
I'm doing this without a team, funding, or paid ads. Just sweat, coffee, and code.

Would love it if you checked it out
Even if you don’t sign up, a simple upvote would mean a lot — I want this post to reach more people who might resonate with it.

Open to feedback, roast, questions, or just your thoughts ❤️
Thanks for reading. Let’s see where this goes.

1kysxag,https://www.reddit.com/r/Custodians/comments/1kysxag/i_messed_up_crying/,I messed up (crying),"TLDR; Been a full time night shift custodian at a smallish prek-8 school for the past 6 months and besides the strange distribution of tasks, my dickhead boss, me ruining my downtime for myself and the wicked calluses forming on my feet, it's overall been good.

I have by far the most intensive zone, I have to walk a minimum of 4 times around the entire school every night. I'm responsible for all hallways, 11 entrances 7 of which are vestibules, 2 superintendent secretaries offices, the entire big main office which itself has 3 smaller offices and a meeting room and a single toilet bathroom, the break/lounge/copy machine room, a library including 2 reading pits and 4 offices around the library, 2 disciplinary/kinder/stim rooms, 2 staff bathrooms each with a single toilet, the main cafeteria bathrooms with 11 toilets, the smaller but still full size gym, and all water fountains not near other bathrooms.

Last couple weeks I really started to dial in my area and methods, that along with skipping lunch and having no more snow meaning less trips to the ends of the whole school, I sometimes found myself with up to 4 hours of effective downtime.

I get that there's always something to do but do they seriously expect me to mop the edges of the hallways and scrub the bathroom walls every night while everyone else takes 10 smoke, coffee, and chew breaks? So after a while I got inspired by my well seasoned coworker always leaving for definitely longer than his prescribed break time, and quickly escalated my extended lunch to tripling it, which admittedly was insane and definitely pushing my limits to the max, I'd just leave and go live my life and come clock back out at time. Did that for a week and a half or so, really thought if I got caught they wouldn't care at this point but yesterday me and that other fast working custodian got the crackdown and yeah it's over, at least for me right now, I guess. Bossman was super pissed said he told the superintendent as well, even brang up how they could prosecute us or whatever, pretty much just got told to stop and mop the edges of the hallways if I get done early. 

Meanwhile a clear favorite of my supervisor seemingly gets to clean his areas whenever he wants, as he only does his gym twice a week. With by far the easiest zone as well consisting of 2 locker rooms with 2 total toilets that barely get used, a weight room that sees minimal use with a tiny single toilet bathroom, the art, tec ed, music, language, and home ec classrooms that are all tile, the front main vestibule and surrounding area in front of the main office that sees little-to-no traffic (all tile as well) a pair of smaller little kid bathrooms, and a single toilet staff bathroom, apparently I'm responsible to come mop a little 4 sq ft section under his 2 f-ing water fountains that are literally connected to his bathroom floors because he only mops to a certain tile line, in a similar vain I have to walk all the way down the one wing just to go in the gym office and change 3 little garbages; and last but not least one of the vestibules I'm responsible for literally leads directly into the area of someone else so that's another entire trip with the vacuum all the way down an entire wing just to go do that tiny area, but my boss wants to start going on about how ""we're a team"" after he realized I wasn't meshing well with mostly everyone else, what a crock. I think at this point I'm definitely being played with, mainly probably because I'm relatively young and to be very honest I don't think my boss or his golden boy like brown people. It feels like they all got together and came up with a bunch of bs to tack onto this zone before I came in... either way it's all corrupt all the way to the top, it's an unsubtle message that they're part of the club and I'm not.

And do I feel guilty ? Not really, I worked hard and busted my a$$ to finish early, I accomplished the same amount of work in 5 hours that used to take me the full 8 and did more than the last guy who consistently took most of the full 8. It's not as if me taking my sweet time or being bored and miserable at the school has any effect on how clean my area is, everything still gets cleaned so what's the big deal? So now I guess it's time to drag a$$ all night and take a good 6+ hours to clean an already mostly clean area like everyone else because apparently they're paying me to suffer, but I digress, still the best gig I've had, definitely beats sitting in the soup aisle all night and morning at Wally World... but yeah I don't expect any sympathy I know a lot more people work a lot tougher routes, I just needed to vent to some people that actually get it and just cut the bs.",2,1748571461.0,Custodians,7,0.67,False

A clear struggle, for the creature surely is unable to understand who or what it is, where it is, and why it is even alive. 

Suddenly it cries out. In pain or confusion, it is not known by, but it cries. Skeletal bones wrapped in synthetic and real flesh reach for its face, attempting to feel itself in some way. Fingers twisting and cracking as they reach out. 

Metal creaking muscles and structure force the creature on its feet with a groan, faltering slightly in an attempt to stand. Synthetic hands reach out forward into the light, trying to get out of this wretched body.

Twisting, sprawling weaves of wires sewn into inorganic flesh across joints of the body, blood replaced by oil and wiring. Haphazardly done by someone with a clear lack of inexperience but the pure height of fantasticism. 

The torso is even more of a disaster than the arms of the poor creature. A grotesque mix of organic, synthetic, and industrial components jambled together in a robust attempt to create something that can live and exist. 

A creation of pure adoration and admiration of *something* but something so clearly unknown and not understood. 

The thing attempts one more time to stand, placing those jumbled wires of hands onto the floor to help steady the weight of the uneven, displaced body it houses.

After a struggle, the creature stands somewhat awkwardly on its feet, and begins to walk with a stumble and lurch. The left leg is slightly longer than its right.

Eyes clink back and forth, robotically, in fractions and increments. Unevenly and slowly, then janky and quickly. Disorienting and distracting.

Language is lost on the creature as it babbles sounds together, stringing them along in a half sentence in such a way a baby and some sort of hypothetical alien would, vocal cords unable to emit anything else.

The stitching down the belly of the creature is massively uneven and lopsided. A plastic tube juts out from the torso, the skin almost *rotting* and *sagging*. 

Several orphaned wires hang loosely, decidedly left alone and eventually discarded and forgotten about. Perhaps it would not all be so wrong if there were no exposed organs, but towards the end of the torso, in a cut in the skin lies an attempt of an intestine, slightly brown and dying already. 

The quiet hum of metal breathing in and out builds to scraping metal, sliding harshly back and forth in an attempt to regulate feelings and soothe the creature. 

It takes one more glance across the now dark room. Feeling around one last time, the creature finds a coffee mug and cradles it in its hands. Perhaps this will guide it to where it belongs. ",10,1748571407.0,shortscarystories,1,0.92,False
