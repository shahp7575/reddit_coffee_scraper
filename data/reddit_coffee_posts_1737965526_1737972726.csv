1ib540g,https://i.redd.it/a5kz1i53hife1.jpeg,The property market in this country especially in this city ….,"The property market in this country is ridiculous how is the next generation supposed to own a house ? I know you can just move out of London as everyone likes to say but some jobs are strictly just in London sadly. As well why is it so bad that younger generations want to live here. I am a millennial, on the older side of it and I will admit we had help buying our property and we wanted to stay in London. I have friends who moved to places like Sheffield and Leeds and have gotten more for their money. But my husband and I have always wanted to stay in London, we live in zone 2+3 ish depending on who you speak to. It’s SW and I am aware we are privileged to be able to own a house in this area. I feel sad for the next generation if things don’t change. 
I have nieces and nephews who have just finished university and are in house shares and the price they pay is ridiculous considering the fact that they’re sharing with 4 to 6 people, one of them has to ask for help from their parents due to majority of their salary going towards rent. 

Ones 21, that’s unfair, just finished university in 2024, being lucky enough to get on a grad scheme, its about 30k a year which I know you can manage in this city but still having a full time job but not being able to have money on the side to go out with friends or to get nice things once in a while. They don’t get fancy coffees in Brixton to whatever. Sick of seeing people say how if you don’t pay for Netflix subscriptions and don’t eat out etc you’ll save money. 
It seems like everyone wants to hate on the younger generation acting as if they’re all wasting money when most of them in this city rely on parental support even when they have full time jobs. ",1,1737972682.0,london,1,1.0,False

Things are great, we get on well and have a very healthy, happy relationship. However there is an issue that's been bugging us lately.

We don't have the same eating habits. She always has breakfast first thing, lunch at lunchtime, dinner at dinner time, etc whereas I am not a breakfast person and my meal times are more free form.

This isn't an issue per se, but when she is going to the kitchen for food, snacks, a hot drink or even a cold drink she will ask me if I want one. 9 times out of 10 the answer is no, but there can be follow up questions which are also answered no.

For example, she will be going downstairs to make a cup of tea. She will ask if I want a cup of tea. I will say no. She will then ask if I want her to make me porridge. I will say no. Do I want orange juice? And so on.

I find this distracting while I'm working and it also sometimes plants a seed that I should go to the kitchen when I wasn't even thinking about it before, leading me to grab a snack that I wasn't ever planning on having.

I've asked her to stop offering, and that I will either ask directly or help myself to things when I want them so there's no need to offer, but she sees it as being polite.

Am I overreacting here? Should I just shut up and eat the toast and drink the tea and accept her love language of giving/feeding? Or should I keep declining forever knowing I will get asked again tomorrow/later? Or should I put my line in the sand and say the answer will always be no and to stop asking?

Atm I have to use PHP, SQL, C, C#, Python, MicroPython, CSS, HTML, Cobol, JCL, Rexx, etc.

It's for work, uni and personal projects as well.

Idk when the list will stop expanding, but currently I'm feeling dumb, because cannot truly master any of them.

My biggest challenge is not programming logic, but remembering the syntax, how to use basic (like all of the standard, built-in) functions to achieve each languages full potential. This is what kills my efficiency.

What to do, if I'm kinda forced to use them all? I know, learn it, but how?

And it's just the programming part.

The same applies to math. Luckily, I've finished my calculus, linear algebra, discrete math classes, but there is a lot I've already forgot. And I'll have another math subjects later.

How to preserve my knowledge and apply it to real life scenarios?

24hrs in a day just not enough.

And I didn't mentioned social life aspects yet. I still have to heavily improve that.

I'm feeling, that the more I learn, the less I know. And I kinda have a bad perfectionism, so I cannot appreciate my own work even if I know there is no thing as perfect work. 
I'm always feeling that I could have done better.

My sleeping schedule is fcked.

At night, I cannot sleep because of stress, so sometimes I'm just trying to learn, but often ending up in decision paralysis, because I know I should sleep and rest instead of learning at nighttime, so I'm just laying on my bed from midnight to 7am, and living on microsleeps and coffee all day long after.

I can hyperfocus on things when under stress (like close deadlines), so this is when my efficiency is the highest. If I have no choice, I'm able to learn a full semester worth of materials from a subject under 5-10 hours just before exams, and still getting a great grade. Not my preferred method, but sometimes, you have no choice.

My only getaway from that madness is sport. So called active rest. It swipes out everything for that 1-2 hours.

**WORST DATE EVER:**

*A little context pre-date:*   
This was in June 2018, so I was 22 years old.  
My fiancé and I both have depression, and have bouts and periods of non-talking. It's never been an issue really, we usually brought each other out of it, but there was a good 3-week bout where it consumed us both badly. I always tried my best to be there too, and she says she did the same, but as one with depression knows, it's hard to help someone when you're drowning yourself. This also happened a long time ago, so my trauma is dealt with from the event, but it still holds up as ""worst date""

\-

A friend of mine offered me tickets to see a play he wrote on opening night for one of the bigger theaters in San Diego (my fiancé and I love/met through theatre, so it was an easy win). I text her the details, and we begin talking again like butter, about what was happening with our own battles the last few weeks, and the excitement for seeing this play.   
The beginning of the date goes fairly smoothly, I drive over to her house and pick her up, we grab a small bite to eat at a diner before, then head to the venue with plenty of time.   
Nothing out of the ordinary happens until we get to the back of the house to sit down for the show.

Now, as a former theater usher, I learned that if you don't know where the seats are, asking the usher is always 1000% faster than trying to find your own seats (assuming you're not a regular).  
So I go to ask her where our seats were, the usher tells me with ease, and as I turn to my fiancé, I see that she has walked off, looking for the seats on her own.  
No big deal, I call her to say something like ""Hey love, the seats are over here,"" and waited for her to catch up to walk to the seats together.  
*(this is where I think I made the biggest mess-up of the night, idk, you can tell me. I could've gone over and got her more quietly, but we were early, no one was behind us or in front of us waiting, idk I overthought this part a lot during and after the night happened)*.

Anyways, we sit down, and we have a small argument about what happened, and she was mad that I asked for directions to the seats. I just say, ""she knows the venue better than we do, so I asked."" Then she counters with ""so instead of searching with me, you asked for help?"" And I was like ""yes, if the help is there, I'm going to take it."" which upset her, ~~and in hindsight, I see why, but I digress~~  
A bit later, but still before the start of the show, my ex says she needs to go to the bathroom, so she goes. Then the show starts, and she doesn't come back. ""aww, she missed the beginning""  
Then a scene passes. then another. one whole act, gone. 

Now I know in some shows, they don't allow reentry into the show once the show has started. THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE SHOWS, I promise you. I saw a guy in front of me get up, exit one scene break, then comeback the next scene break.  
You know what she did? SHE MOVED TO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEAT BEHIND AND AWAY FROM ME. I didn't see her until the lights came up at the start of intermission, when I can stand and turn around (as I was about to head out to look for her).

She comes back to our seats, tells me not to worry about it, she saw from the back, and while I'm a little confused as we had an aisle seat, I don't question it, as I know she doesn't like to cause disruptions, no matter how tiny. My friend, the playwright, comes by and asks what we think so far, I tell him I'm loving it, she says something like ""he couldn't stop laughing between the breaks""*~~(It's a comedy, I'm gonna laugh, it's how I get my free tickets/invites to theater shows (I don't care if people find out this secret, they're too scared to be the only guy laughing in the audience, I'm not))~~* which is true, but she acted as if she was next to me the whole time (not this exact line but ""He almost knocked me out of my seat"" kind of things)

My friend then asks about my latest endeavors in theatre, I share I got a part in my favorite musical (In The Heights), my fiancé was like ""what! I never knew that!"" and I was like ""Yeah, I thought I texted you, I'm so sorry!"" then continue on about my excitement with the roll I was gonna be *(I knew I texted her when I got it, but I wasn't going to air dirty laundry around my friend and others around).*

The rest of the night goes on without much incident, she sat next to me the rest of the show, and she was more quiet than usual, but I try to not let it bother me from the play happening in front of me, (which was very funny, and I'm not saying that cuz I know the writer)

We stay for the afterparty for a bit, but as my fiancé was not much of drinkers, and she's definitely not the sociable one ~~(we're both introverts, but I grew up in a family of extroverts, so I learned how to socialize with everybody (people say ambivert. I say extroverted introvert)). (NOT PART OF THE STORY)~~ we dip.

On the drive home, I can tell she has something she wants to say, and I want her to say it. So I pull over (in a residential area) and tell her to let it out.

She wants to break up.  
Which hit me like a TON of bricks. I start crying instantly. She tries to reason, but I'm kinda just flooded with emotions. So I pause her, and I'm like ""look, I can't process anything right now, so I'm going to drive you home, and leave it at that for now.""

And that's what I did. It was a long 20 minute drive to her place. When I stop at her place. We start talking again. I beg for it not to end. But she was adamant on it. I ask her what I did wrong, she says nothing, that ""No one will ever love me as much as you did."" *~~(banger line, couldn't wait to drop that on my therapist)~~*

Anyways, about a week later, I found out that during our 3-week depression season, she started seeing this guy I had cast for my play I wrote earlier that year. About 2 months after that, I met that guy's ex, and found out that we got dumped the same weekend by our exes.

And about 2 months after that, I had...

\------------------------------------------------

... the **BEST DATE EVER \[STORY\]**

What you thought me connecting these was lazy, naw homie, they connected by exes

November 2018, I was still 22 years old.

So this date wasn't supposed to be a date. At least, we didn't say it was a date initially. But in hindsight, it was definitely a date. Most we've done at this time was some light flirting, but we never had gone out alone before, and weren't acting couple-ish in our friend group. I always thought she was beautiful, but I never thought I had a chance. But still, friendly all the same.

And I also want to preface this by saying that I've done better romantic gestures, and gone more all out for dates before and since this. The bummy-ness of this date does not match my romantic output *~~(ask about promposals sometime, I got a story for that)~~*

\-

We were meeting for lunch and a park hangout, as she found out I never had Freddy's before in an earlier conversation (Freddy's is a fast food establishment, the location we went to in San Diego has closed now, but there's a lot in Vegas). So I go pick her up, get somethings that were apparently ""to die for"" at Freddy's then went to a park to eat, and started talking about whatever. 

Eventually, the convo goes to video games, and with the breeze from the bay hitting and the frozen custard we were having, I suggested to get out of the cold and go over to my place, and put some walk behind that talk she was spitting ~~(im pretty sure it was mario kart).~~

And it gets intense. At first, she was taking L's left and right (she would've hated me if I let her win) so we start doing it where the winner takes a shot of alcohol (since I was winning so much). We start going back and forth on that, and before we get too drunk we switch to another game (it was a co-op but for the life of me, I cannot remember, I think this was peak drunkenness and I was getting over that). After awhile of playing that, she sees I have Detroit: Become Human, instantly was like ""I have always wanted to play it, so I started it up for her, and let her start a new game."" 

So I'm on the couch, in that corner L spot, and she's sitting on the floor, having the time of her life asking me about the decisions I made, or would make. Now, you don't need to know too much about the game for this story except there's this one mechanic in it that requires controller movement in a certain motion (the latest in PS4 technology lol).  And she couldn't figure it out. So I'm like ""here, let me show you""

So she gets up and sits on the front part of the corner L.   
So I slide next to her and grab the controller  
She gave like a surprised and disappointed ""oh"" - which is when it clicks that she didn't want me sliding next to her. *~~(F%\*\^. &U\*K. F%%%%%%%%UU%%%%%)~~*

With that in mind, I make sure to stay right up next to her as I show the motions. When she seems to get it, we're like ""hell yeah"", and the gaming continues, us just next to each other, like really close. Then I feel a little peck on my cheek.  
I turn to look at her and I SWEAR seeing her blush was one of the cutest scenes ever. So I kiss her cheek.  
She blushes, turns to me, and full on TACKLES ME ON THE COUCH AND (skipping forward for youngins but no smush) we end up cuddled up on the couch, watching Kiki's Delivery Service (I hadn't watched any Studio Ghibli films before, mentioned a very vague memory of watching a trailer for that movie, so she put it on so we could watch).

We fell asleep shortly after. And upon waking up, she was snuggled in my chest and arms. The sunlight slowly showing itself, the birds chirping, and the breeze rolling in (I had a westward facing sliding door at the time) it was like waking up to a Jack Johnson love song. 

And this is the biggest reason why I say this date was the best date ever. After dealing such a traumatic heartbreak, to be able to find peace with someone else in my arms, was the most liberating thing I've ever felt romantically.

Like I had made a PROMISE to MARRY someone completely different. They broke my heart with some ""no one will ever love like you do"" trauma, to go and be with SOMEONE ELSE. And now, on a whim, I have something of substance again, and that was enough to make me get on with my life completely.

Eventually she woke up, I bought us some coffee, we drove to her place, which wasn't too far from mine. We talked about us, and she says that, while she wants to, she doesn't feel over her ex. Touché. Then nearly 24 hours after I had picked her up for Freddy's, I dropped her off.

I've never shared this story before, so it was fun to write out and remember. We dated a bit after that at different times, but it didn't work out. Thankfully, life doesn't need to wrap a life lesson with a neat bow to still be a phenomenal gift. And she's still a good friend to talk to from time to time. Haven't talked with my ex-fiancé since the split either. Haven't had a desire to honestly, but I hope she's doing well.

But yeah, after all of that, I learned how to roller-skate, wrote poetry about everything to help process, and went on with my life lol",1,1737972352.0,sweetnsourpod,0,1.0,False

My kids are older, but I have become such light sleeper I think this is what's causing my weight to never really reduce. In fact I feel that as I am getting older I feel my weight creeping higher despite all I do.

I eat approx 50g protein a day, exercise 5km walking to 10km walking a day at work and after work, pilates 2-3x a week, calories roughly 1800 calories for my short height.

I rarely eat anything sweet. On occasion small cakes and chocolates.

My general daily meals:
Breakfast
1 mug of coffee with milk
1 egg turned into an omelette or scrambled eggs 

Lunch:
1 can of tuna
2 serves of Yoghurt 
Or 1-2 boiled eggs

On the school run:
Snacks cucumber, carrots with hummus, or an apple or banana.

Dinner is usually
Stir fried veggies usually bok choy or broccoli or asian greens with stir fried meat generally  korean beef strips or prawns or chicken or steamed fish
Usually calories from this is the 500 calorie mark.

Rarely sweet potato noodles, egg noodles, brown rice, rarely cheese as it makes me overeat and rarely sweets. Cut out breads, anything starchy processed.

I usually hit 1600 calories, rarely dipping below 1500 calories. At times I have hit 2000 calories if I'm eating carbs. 

So I eat and exercise well, I'm fit and active, I can outrun my friends with hiking and weights and eating I feel that if I really go into any more deficit I will end up reverse binge eating and sabotage myself.

My real issue is my sleep, I get on average 6 hours sleep, sometimes 4 sometimes 5. I need to sleep more but how. I am usually asleep at 11pm and usually wake up at 5 or 6am, I really struggle to sleep the recommended 7-9 hours. Many times no matter what time I go to bed eg 8pm-11pm, I am wide awake at 3am! There is just too much to fit in as a working mother and I am too much of a light sleeper and my brain just can't sleep longer. This is years of broken sleep with baby life.

I know that many friends talk about getting 10-12 hours sleep and that's how they've truly lost weight. Does anyone else notice that if they're not getting their sleep they will never lose weight!?

What tips of mothers around age 35-45 done? Some friends have suggested periodical fasting but that just makes me more wide awake.

When our characters suffer addiction we know little about we should look up these different things to add into the description of the traits to provide more depth and reality to them. It makes it more three dimensional and can build into different subplots that are integrated into a larger storyline.

   - Craving
   - Tolerance
   - Withdrawal symptoms
   - Loss of control

2. **Tobacco:**

Let’s Talk (600) -  
 Not everything needs to be solved with violence as mere words can and have brought about change. When it comes to talking you are the absolute master at it and have the charisma to back it up. There isn’t a single being around that is not an open book when you glance in their direction. You’ll know their goals, aspirations, life history and anything else regardless of whether they are human or not. With that knowledge it’s trivial to get anyone to dance to your tune with a bit of small talk. No one will ever wise up to the fact that you’re taking them apart piece by piece and replacing it with whatever you want them to think or believe.
You can change an entire person’s outlook on life, convince people that humans and mutants can coexist or that humans deserve to be slaves under mutants even if they are human and vice versa despite the contradictory and ethical evidence, and pretty much anything else you want. Changing the mind of a mutant hell-bent on the destruction of humanity over a coffee break is literal child’s play. People might as well be mind controlled given how short the list of things they won’t do for you. This works whether it’s just one person or multiple people. Suffice to say if you’re in front of a government on national tv you can definitely change the status quo. You’ll do the right thing and be the ultimate therapist to help others with this power right?

I started the carnivore diet (plus cheese) on 20.10.24. I love the changes I've experienced with this diet so far—there have been many improvements! However, I've noticed a new problem with my digestive system.

Ever since I started the carnivore diet, I've been experiencing stomach pain that feels like a burning sensation. I believe it's related to the elevated acidity levels in my stomach.

I especially feel it in the morning—I'm not hungry, but to make this feeling go away, I have to eat. Because of this, I can’t stick to my intermittent fasting (IF), and I’ve noticed it’s affecting my productivity at work.

This burning sensation gets worse when I drink coffee. Without coffee, I still feel it, but it’s slightly less intense.

Sometimes, this burning sensation come back in the afternoon, even if I ate three hours earlier. I end up needing to eat again just to get rid of this uncomfortable feeling.

Actually, this is the only issue I’ve had with the diet so far.

Has anyone else experienced this problem?  
Do you have any advice or solutions for dealing with this?",1,1737970535.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False

I'm not saying my liver was plotting revenge, but after that month-long 'research' into craft IPAs, something had to give.

Anyway, decided to try out these liver cleanse supplements, here's my thoughts.

# First thoughts

Let me paint you a picture of rock bottom. it's 2am, I'm doom-scrolling through WebMD, trying to self-diagnose why I feel like I swallowed a beach ball that's attempting a prison break through my ribcage. The empty pizza box on my coffee table judges me silently. My cat, the only witness to my descent, stares at me with disappointment.

When I first stumbled across DOSE (probably during another 3am health anxiety spiral), my initial reaction was skepticism. Another detox product? Great. Just what the world needs.

But then I noticed the ingredients list read like an actual herbalist's shopping list, not a chemical warfare inventory. Interesting.

The fact that it comes with its own shot glass also amused me. There's something poetically just about using a shot glass for health purposes after all.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Heads up:

**BEST PRICE on the DOSE for Your Liver Supplements here:**

[**https://amzn.to/4hsolcX**](https://amzn.to/4hsolcX)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features that matter

**Formulation.** The bioavailable curcumin isn't just regular turmeric - it's turmeric that's actually going to make it into your system instead of just making expensive urine.

**The daily ritual.** Each bottle gives you 8 servings, meant to be taken as 2oz shots once or twice daily. The included stainless steel shot glass isn't just fancy packaging - it's actually crucial for measuring too. neat.

**Ingredients.** The combination of milk thistle, dandelion, ginger, and orange isn't random. It's a carefully orchestrated blend that actually makes sense if you research each of these. 

**Packaging.** Arrives in a protective box that's actually protective (unlike those Amazon packages where they throw a glass item in with a single air pillow and hope for the best).

# Pros

* **Taste.** Unlike most health supplements that taste like punishment, this actually goes down without triggering your gag reflex. The orange and ginger make it almost... enjoyable. Don't tell anyone I said that.

* **Noticeable results.** After a few weeks my post-meal bloating went from ""who inflated me"" to ""oh, I'm actually comfortable."" My energy levels improved enough that I didn't need my 3pm coffee-and-regret session. Maybe a coincidence, who knows.

* **Quality ingredients.** Everything is organic, which means my anxiety-prone brain doesn't have to worry about what industrial pesticides I'm drinking.

* **Convenience.** The shot glass and pre-measured bottles take the guesswork out of dosing. Even in my pre-coffee morning haze, I can't mess this up.

# Cons

* **Price.** It's not cheap. My wallet had a minor panic attack when I first saw the cost.

* **Can feel like a commitment.** Sometimes remembering to take it twice a day feels like trying to remember if you actually locked your door - you think you did, but did you really?

# Last Words

DOSE isn't a miracle cure. It won't undo years of treating your liver like a bounce house at a kid's party. But it's probably the closest thing to an apology gift you can give your internal organs.

Who should buy this? Anyone who's realized their body isn't as forgiving as it used to be, people who want to support their liver without choking down pills, and those who have the budget to invest in their health. Also, anyone who's ever Googled ""why am I bloated"" at 2am - this one's especially for you.

For me? It's become part of my ""I'm actually trying to be an adult"" routine, alongside flossing and checking my tire pressure more than once a year.

I received my degree in August, BA in Psychology. Before I finished this degree, I realized that I did not want to major in psychology anymore. My original plan was to be a therapist. 

After years of going to therapy, I discovered that I only wanted to be a therapist and help others, because I felt alone and felt that I had to help understand others.

I now realize that the meaning of my life is to be supportive of my siblings, as so much is going on. I'm the biggest advocate for their mental health and advocate on others getting help, I'm just lost.

I did 2 months in and Eating Disorder treatment facility, but I realized that I'm still struggling with mine. I'm currently working with 988, two months in, but it's so upseting hearing what everyone is going through. They want to be listened to and have a conversation, and the risk assessment questions we have to ask sometimes annoy them because they don't feel suicidal, they just want to feel like someone cares. Some share it just helps them check in with themselves because they're depressed and they've recognized that talking helps them from having a full crisis. Having to be so cold and neutral and serious is hard. I am so happy that some people just call in to share something positive, but it's hard having to stick to ""the script"". 

It's not a script, as we active listen, but knowing that we can say much is painful. I also am going through a suicidal crisis and it feels funny knowing that I work with 988. 

I don't think I'm weak, I know I'm strong and can get through it. I just don't think my idea of helping others is in mental health anymore. I can't even go to a therapist on my own.

I want to communicate with people. I want people to be heard. I just want to have peace in my life and mind. I don't know what to do. 

I want to quit this job but my dad would be so disappointed. He wants be to be the first therapist and professional in the family, but I don't know if I want to do that. 

I was happier just stocking products at a grocery store and getting to know all my coworkers, then working from home.

Any advice on what career path would be more suited for me? Should I quit this job?  I like to write, communicate with people, I love coffee and would learn to be a barista if it paid more. I just need a career that will give me financial stability but also something that gives me joy and where I can prioritize my mental health.",1,1737969499.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo announced that Colombia will accept deported citizens under “decent conditions.” The White House confirmed the resumption of deportation flights while maintaining some penalties, including visa sanctions, until the first flight successfully lands.

1ib42q5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Competitive-Cress-64/comments/1ib42q5/the_role_of_graphic_design_in_developing_business/,The Role of Graphic Design in Developing Business Marketing Strategies for Melbourne Companies,"Effective marketing strategies are key drivers of growth in the highly competitive business world of Melbourne. These strategies will also help to establish brand identity and reach targeted audiences. Among these, graphic design is one of the most pivotal elements. Graphic design ranges from [**business logo design Melbourne**](https://www.marznow.com.au/professional-logo-design-melbourne/) to corporate branding, and it plays an integral role in how companies present themselves to the world.

**Establishing Brand Identity through Logo Design**

A well-crafted logo is often the first touchpoint between a company and its potential customers. In Melbourne, where businesses range from creative startups to established corporations, a [**professional logo design Melbourne**](https://www.marznow.com.au/professional-logo-design-melbourne/) can communicate a brand's core values, mission, and personality in a single glance. A strong logo not only attracts attention but also makes a lasting impression, fostering brand recognition and loyalty.

For instance, consider a Melbourne-based coffee shop that wishes to convey a warm, inviting atmosphere. The logo design should reflect that ethos, employing earthy tones and gentle typography to elicit a sense of comfort. By integrating such design elements into the logo, the business establishes a recognizable brand that resonates with its consumers emotionally.

**Ensuring Consistency Across Marketing Channels**

When developing [**business marketing strategies Melbourne**](https://www.marznow.com.au/business-marketing-strategies-melbourne/), consistency is crucial. A cohesive graphic design ensures that all marketing materials, from brochures to social media posts, convey the same message and visual tone. In [**corporate graphic design Melbourne**](https://www.marznow.com.au/graphic-design-melbourne/) agencies work closely with businesses to craft a unified design system that harmonizes all aspects of their marketing efforts.

This consistency not only goes a long way in establishing relationships with customers, but it reinforces brand identity also. When customers see a same logo or specific design feature they are likely to associate with their favorite brand on each platform: online ad, some promotional flyer on the counter of a local department store, email newsletter. Subconsciously they will develop allegiance to the same brand. Then, that brings more customer loyalty and sales opportunities.

**Designing Online Reputation through Visual Materials**

In the age of digital marketing, the role of graphic design expands considerably into the online world. With Melbourne companies increasingly moving their marketing efforts online, engaging graphic design is key to capturing attention and driving conversions. Businesses need high-quality visuals for their websites, social media, email marketing campaigns, and online advertisements.

Graphic designers create eye-catching visuals that align with the overall marketing strategy. For example, creating infographics to illustrate complex information can enhance engagement and shareability on platforms like Instagram or LinkedIn. By investing in professional graphic design, Melbourne businesses can improve their online presence and attract a wider audience, contributing to their overall success.

**Distinguishing from Competitors**

Melbourne's diverse business environment means that companies must find unique ways to stand out. Graphic design is essential in differentiating a brand from its competitors. A well-chosen color palette, typography, and imagery can set a business apart in a crowded marketplace.

For instance, a tech startup might use modern, sleek designs in its promotional materials to convey innovation and forward-thinking, while a vintage clothing store might opt for retro aesthetics that echo its brand image. By tailoring graphic design choices to fit the brand's identity and target demographic, businesses can create a distinctive market presence that attracts the right customers.

**Communicating Messages Effectively**

Graphic design is definitely not just beautiful; it needs to communicate powerfully. One well-designed piece of marketing communications says much using few words-precisely what a consumer or audience member living in Melbourne expects and needs most when attention levels are short-term.

It utilizes visual hierarchy to make important information stand out in the form of contrasting font sizes for headlines and body text that guide consumers through the material. In addition, the strategic use of images is emotive and narrates stories to resonate with the potential customers in order to strengthen marketing strategies in general.

**Conclusion**

In a nutshell, graphic design forms the core element in developing business marketing strategies for Melbourne companies. This goes from creating an effective business logo design to having a corporate identity that is perfectly cohesive. Professional graphic design thus weaves visual and conceptual strands that drive business success. Given the fact that businesses are ever-changing, capitalizing on any opportunity and being well-related with customers will eventually be achieved. In a vibrant city like Melbourne, where creativity thrives, harnessing the power of graphic design is not just an option; it's a necessity.

Whether you’re selecting a dining table, a [stylish side table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables), or a [rattan coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/sanjuan-rattan-table), choosing the right shape ensures that the furniture harmonizes with your layout and complements your design style. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you make the perfect choice for your space, with tips on where to find the best options at your favorite [home furniture shop](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/).

# 1. Round Tables: Perfect for Small Spaces

Round tables are a versatile choice for compact rooms or tight corners. Their absence of sharp edges makes them ideal for spaces where movement is frequent, such as dining areas or living rooms with children. A round rattan coffee table can soften the look of modern interiors and add a cozy, inviting feel.

**Design Tip:** Round tables are excellent for creating a sense of intimacy, especially in dining rooms or social gathering spaces. For a touch of elegance, pair them with [boho furniture Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/), where eclectic designs meet artisanal craftsmanship.

# 2. Rectangular Tables: Classic and Functional

Rectangular tables are a timeless choice, ideal for larger rooms or open-plan layouts. They maximize seating capacity and work well as dining tables or work desks. A rectangular stylish side table can also act as a functional piece for storing books, decor, or even drinks beside a sofa.

**Pro Tip:** Ensure that there’s at least 3 feet of clearance on all sides of a rectangular table for comfortable movement. Visit a home furniture shop to explore rectangular tables in wood, metal, or mixed-material designs.

# 3. Square Tables: Balanced and Symmetrical

Square tables are perfect for rooms where symmetry is a design priority. They work well in square dining rooms or compact living spaces. A small square table also doubles as a versatile stylish side table, offering plenty of surface area for decorative accents.

**Styling Idea:** For a relaxed, bohemian vibe, accessorize a square table with layered textiles or natural elements. Incorporate pieces from boho furniture in Dubai for an effortlessly chic look.

# 4. Oval Tables: Elegant and Space-Saving

Oval tables combine the best of both worlds, offering the surface area of rectangular tables with the soft curves of round designs. This makes them an excellent choice for dining rooms or living spaces where you want to maximize seating without sharp edges.

**Why Choose an Oval Table?** They are ideal for narrow spaces, as their rounded ends allow for easier movement while still offering plenty of functionality.

# 5. Freeform and Irregular Shapes: Creative and Modern

For a more contemporary or artistic look, freeform tables can make a bold statement. These tables work best in eclectic or modern interiors where the goal is to add a sculptural element to the room. A freeform rattan coffee table can add texture and natural warmth to a minimalist setting.

**Pro Tip:** Keep the rest of your furniture simple to let an irregular-shaped table shine as the centerpiece.

# Factors to Consider When Choosing a Table Shape

# Room Size and Layout

* Small spaces benefit from round or square tables.
* Larger rooms can accommodate rectangular or oval tables.

# Functionality

Think about how you’ll use the table. Is it for dining, working, or as a decorative accent? For example:

* A stylish side table can hold a lamp or books in the living room.
* A rattan coffee table can anchor a seating area with natural textures.

# Style and Material

Your table should complement the overall theme of your home. For bohemian-inspired interiors, look for options at boho furniture stores in Dubai, which often feature unique designs crafted from natural materials like rattan or wood.

**Why Shop for Tables in Dubai?**

Dubai offers a rich array of home furniture shops catering to all styles and preferences. From sleek, modern tables to rustic and bohemian designs, you’ll find the perfect piece to complete your space. If you’re on the hunt for a rattan coffee table or a stylish side table, Dubai’s furniture stores are known for their curated collections that blend global trends with local craftsmanship.

**Final Thoughts**

Choosing the right table shape is key to enhancing your room layout while reflecting your personal style. Whether you’re drawn to the elegance of oval tables, the practicality of rectangular designs, or the charm of a round rattan coffee table, there’s a perfect option for every space. Visit a trusted home furniture shop or explore boho furniture in Dubai to find the table that complements your home decor beautifully.

First, we have been away from our home countries for about 10 years. We now live in the West US coast. My wife would like to go back, but I have a pretty good job here that makes our situation much better financially than what it would be back there. She got papers a few years ago to work here too, but she hasn't been able to find a position she likes so she has done online masters and courses in the meantime. I know she's frustrated about this and I have been helping her out find a job as much as I possibly can.

We have a KG son we adore. He's my everything. I have made it my duty my family has everything they need, financially and emotionally. I wake up early to prepare breakfast for them and warm the lunch and snacks for my kiddo. I go to work from 10-6, so we can have coffee with my wife in the morning, and I'm home early (son is out of childcare at 5 pm) so I can prepare dinner for them and be with them. I prepare my son for bed, including giving him baths sacredly every day. I put him to bed with bedtime stories. I stay up late preparing nice lunches for everyone for the next day. I prepare nice things for special occasions and holidays (eg, I make homemade dinners they love, or arrange presents or little setups --- make them feel special as much as I can).

This is all a lot. I'm exhausted. I sleep 5-6 hours a day. I actually can't do much more for myself (eg, hobbies, workout --- although I'm in decent shape thanks to controlling my diet). But I love my family, and I do it happily. Or I did. Because for my wife --- all of the above is apparently not enough. And I don't know what to do.

In the past year she's been distant at times. It goes in waves. Some days she's great, affectionate, close --- but some other days, she's distant. She gives me the cold shoulder. When I ask what's up she says ""nothing"", but after insisting she reveals something I did which, in my opinion, is minor. For example giving Mayo to my Son (which he loves, but she doesn't want him to have it). She says hurtful things like ""you act like you don't care"" --- but then I note all of the above and she's like ""well, this is important to me and you don't care"". And she might be partially right --- I do think it was a mistake to give Mayo to our son, but I don't think the response should be to not talk to me for the entire day.

This all has been crawling to our sex life lately as well. She's evidently aroused after I initiate sex --- but she also evidently wants it to be quick and for me to just ""do it"". About a week ago this reached a breaking point as we were having sex, but she didn't want to be touched and literally told me to ""just finish"". I felt disgusting (like forcing her to do something she doesn't want to do). Now I don't want to initiate sex again.

We've talked about it but she says she doesn't know what is going on. That she loves me, but that she just doesn't know.

My hunch tells me she's frustrated of the job market situation here and wants to go back (she says that back there she would instantly get a job, which is probably true). But going back would mean *my* job situation (and in all odds our *joint* financial situation) wouldn't be nearly as good as it is here, and I think she knows this. I have actually (against my will because I have a dream job) told her to go back if that would make her happy --- but she says no, that she'll wait at least until she starts working here.

It could also be she's just not as attracted to me anymore. I've thought maybe she has someone else --- but she denies it. And I know her well, she wouldn't do something like this (especially not to our Son).

I'm lost. Should we consider counselling? Would that actually be useful? I mentioned to her but she doesn't seem very receptive to it. What other options do I have to try to figure this out?

- **White:** Create a crisp, clean look. White cabinets with a grey backsplash or countertops embody a timeless appeal.
- **Black:** Adding black accents can enhance the sophistication of a grey kitchen, making it stylish and chic.
- **Bright Colors:** pops of yellow, turquoise, or red can bring energy and liveliness to the space.

Your kitchen layout will also impact the grey home decor aesthetic. Consider the following:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/grey-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Open Concept:** In an open-concept layout, grey walls can unify spaces. Use grey kitchen islands to separate cooking and dining areas.
- **Galley Style:** In smaller kitchens, light grey hues can maximize space, making the kitchen feel larger and airier.
- **U-Shaped or L-Shaped:** These layouts can benefit from darker greys on cabinetry or feature walls, creating a striking contrast against lighter elements.

### Textures and Materials

Various textures can elevate the overall decor. Think about mixing:

- **Matte Finishes:** Matte grey cabinets create a soft and sophisticated look.
- **Glossy Accents:** Use glossy backsplash tiles for a modern twist against muted grey tones.
- **Textured Fabrics:** Soft furnishings, like seat cushions, can feature different grey patterns and textures to enhance comfort.
- **Stone or Wood:** Natural elements provide warmth and break the monotony of grey surfaces.

### Lighting Choices

- **Task Lighting:** Ensure that work areas are well-lit with under-cabinet lights or pendant fixtures.

- **Accent Lighting:** Highlight specific design elements or decor items with accent lights.

### Accessories and Decorative Elements

Accessorizing is key to achieving a stylish look in your grey home decor kitchen. Consider these additions:

- **Artwork:** Display colorful art pieces or framed images to contrast the grey.
- **Plants:** Greenery adds life. Choose pots that complement your grey decor.
- **Utensil Holders:** Opt for chic containers that fit your aesthetic, be it modern, rustic, or eclectic.

The Psychological Impact of Grey Color Schemes in Kitchen Spaces
----------------------------------------------------------------

The kitchen is often considered the heart of the home, where families come together to share meals and create memories. When it comes to choosing the right color scheme for this vital space, grey has emerged as a popular choice. While it may seem like a neutral or uninspired color, the psychological impact of grey color schemes in kitchen spaces can be quite profound. Let’s explore how grey can influence our mood, perception, and overall kitchen experience.

Grey is a versatile color that can evoke different emotions depending on the shade and the accompanying decor. Light greys create a bright, airy atmosphere that can foster a sense of calm and tranquility. Darker shades, on the other hand, introduce a feeling of sophistication and elegance. Here are some distinct psychological effects that grey can have in your kitchen:

- **Calmness:** Light grey tones promote serenity. This can be particularly beneficial in a kitchen where cooking and meal prep may become stressful.
- **Focus:** Grey is non-distracting, allowing you to concentrate on your culinary tasks. This enhanced focus can lead to better organization and productivity.
- **Balance:** Grey serves as a neutral backdrop that harmonizes with various colors. This balance can lead to a sense of peace within your kitchen.
- **Elegance:** Darker greys can add a touch of sophistication to your kitchen. They create an upscale vibe that can elevate the overall design.

When considering grey home decor for your kitchen, it's important to think about how different shades work together. The beauty of grey is that it pairs well with a multitude of other colors. For instance, combining soft grey cabinets with white countertops creates a clean and modern aesthetic. You might also choose to accentuate your grey theme with bold colors, such as bright yellow or deep navy, for a pop of excitement.

Moreover, the use of grey can significantly affect how light interacts within your kitchen. Natural and artificial lighting greatly influence the perception of color. Here are key points to consider:

- **Natural Light:** In well-lit kitchens, light grey walls can reflect sunlight beautifully, enhancing the room's openness and liveliness.
- **Artificial Light:** Under warm artificial lighting, grey can appear cozy and inviting, creating a welcoming atmosphere.
- **Shadows:** Darker grey shades may absorb light, adding depth, but be cautious as this can make smaller spaces feel cramped.

Another aspect of grey home decor is the psychology of texture. Using different materials in various grey shades can create depth and interest. For example, mixing matte grey cabinets with shiny stainless steel appliances provides a dynamic contrast. The combination of textures can stimulate visual and tactile engagement, making your kitchen feel more inviting.

It’s worth noting that the emotional impact of grey varies among individuals. Some may find it refreshing and calming, while others might perceive it as gloomy. To achieve the best results, consider incorporating warm elements into your grey decor, such as wooden accents or colorful art pieces, to offset any potential coldness that grey might convey.

In essence, the psychological impact of grey color schemes in kitchen spaces can range from calm and focused to elegant and sophisticated. By thoughtfully selecting the right shade and combining it with careful design elements, you can create a kitchen environment that enhances your culinary experiences and promotes a positive atmosphere. Remember to pay attention to how light interacts with your chosen shades and embrace textures that bring life to your grey decor.

Ultimately, whether you're cooking dinner or entertaining friends, a well-designed grey kitchen can foster a pleasing ambiance that supports both productivity and relaxation. Embrace the versatility of grey, and let this timeless color transform your kitchen into a space that not only looks great but feels positive and welcoming.

### Conclusion

Embracing grey home decor for your kitchen is not just about aesthetics, but also about creating a space that feels good to be in. The stylish design tips and trends highlighted earlier serve as a roadmap for transforming your kitchen into a sophisticated haven. By incorporating elements like sleek grey cabinetry, textured backsplashes, and metallic accents, you can achieve a modern look that resonates with your personal style.

Moreover, understanding the psychological impact of grey color schemes adds another layer of depth to your design choices. Grey promotes calmness and balance, making your kitchen an inviting space for family gatherings or quiet cup of coffee moments. By carefully selecting shades of grey and pairing them with warm tones or pops of color, you can create an atmosphere that feels both cozy and elegant.

I’ve taken bowel preps and nothing happens. 

There seems to be no rhyme or reason. I use to have a bowel movement with every panic attack but that has stopped and I most of the time can count on my month cycle to give me a good bowel movement but other than that there is no rhyme or reason. I had a coffee last week and had a bowel movement within an hour after going 10 days. Today I had a coffee and nothing.

Miralax makes me sick and gives me PVCS. Truelance makes me sick and sometimes works but most of the time doesn’t. Most laxatives just make me sick. I don’t know what triggers a bowel movement but it’s definitely not meds.

1ib3v0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ib3v0e/njeri_the_love_thief/,NJERI THE LOVE THIEF,"Damn! The coffee is tasteless despite using  the best Kenyan coffee,my heart beat rate is 120 times per minute way above the recommended 60 times per minute, I know this from my smart watch damn that's the only thing that she ever got for me. My emaciated heart is tired and not because of its fundamental role of pumping blood but from the heart break that Njeri from Karatina caused, damn a trip to Diani would give me the much needed serenity.

Damn! There is a famous line - love is for the birds. Does love really exist? The question lingers in my own mind since Njeri robbed me of all the hope I had left.

Being a man and trying to find love isn't a walk in the pack. When young, every girl carries you around saying how cute you are while  giving you numerous relentless kisses on the cheek ,but as time goes by so does the number of women who throw unsolicited compliments and kisses decline. 

A man unlike a woman is born with nothing he has no value at all, women on the other hand have their intrinsic value. The game is rigged against men, men have no room for mediocrity and indolence. No one loves a man for the simple fact that he exists, women on the other hand don't have to do much, they only have to keep a low body count or atleast keep secret the number of men that have penetrated her and as long as she is respectful then she is good ,infact very good /suitable to the alphas and betas out there. We could add beauty as a plus but beauty is relative. 

I learnt my lesson the hard way , Njeri from Karatina was truly sent by the devil ! When I first saw Njeri I was dumb founded, damn! God definitely created her on her own specific day, she seemed that whenever she walked past a flower, it would definitely bloom. Njeri was so beautifully made and it is for this reason I am convinced she was sent by the evil one, 10years ago the evil one had sent alcohol my way it didn't work, he later sent poverty and as fate would have it I was out of that too, but as they say when the devil wants to finish you, he comes in the form of a woman.

Njeri's waist was small while her derriere was huge , she definitely had a very bright future behind her, I often loved to see her leave , I know you know what I mean. Njeri's face was spotless the perfect 'minji minji', her amiable nature would lure you in with ease, her smile was so perfect that I often wondered how she wasn't the face of Colgate, Njeri's face was sculptured into perfection, her eyebrows were beautiful, her eyes were fantastic, her smile damn her smile was out of this world. Njeri's skin was so even colored and she smelled like coco butter all the time.

 I always thanked the gods that Njeri wasn't Charles Darwin's cousin for he would have surely married her. You see Charles Darwin was a man so full of jealousy that he wouldn't fathom the idea of anyone else marrying his cousin except himself and I'm sure Njeri would have suffered the same fate ,Njeri ooh my 'minji minji'.

Indo iria njega niere ene- ( translation the good things have owners) ,  I knew Njeri was booked ,for in theory  Njeri was 23 when I first saw her, assuming that she has been this beautiful it means that 5 males try their luck almost daily, that's 150 males in a month in a year that's 1800 males with one specific goal , even if Njeri can decline the advances of the first 100 how would she decline the advances of the next 1700 without fail? Assuming Njeri has been this beautiful all her life the math would be discouraging.

Anyway something must kill a man, and there's an Igbo proverb that says  that a man who swallows a whole coconut has great faith in his anus, I had the thought after all it's the thought that counts. I approached Njeri said hello , asked her if she would be free that coming Friday and she said she'll be free. That was so easy.

Friday - we went out on a date , and she seemed like a cool girl , she spent the weekend at my place, she told me she was single and I thought I had hit the jackpot , Amerix says don't put women on a pedestal, I tried and I'm sorry master for failing.

Monday - her gas was finished .
Tuesday - her rent was due
Wednesday - her birthday was around the corner
Thursday - her nails need to be done
Friday - she doesn't sleep in the house, she prefers to club the whole night with my money
Saturday - clubbing
Sunday - church then nyama joint with shisha

I kept up till I couldn't that's when I learnt about Omosh the cousin, I later learnt that Omosh was my helper and not cousin as Njeri had told me, I called Omosh one fine morning and he was surprised, I later learnt of Mj the wakili , Evans the Doc , Jemo Mercedes , Karis MCA and damn the list was endless.

I'm glad that heart break was the only thing I came out with and my third member is still intact. Omosh vowed to teach her a lesson , I told him that he should get out while still alive, he refused.

Njeri knows that God forgives that's why she goes to church every Sunday and became a full-time bed to bed midfielder during the week. Njeri used to date the highest bidder and keep the other bidders too.

I have never had a relationship with the mother in law really, I have always felt her as very belittling and would comment on our relationship. 
She has a very turbulent relationship with my partner (her son) and often cuts him off six months at a time. She hasn't seen our daughter since she was 3 months old as a result of her cutting off her son and not wanting anything to do with me. 
She also is not a very nice person about me and my family, she has also explained how she would punish (hit her) my daughter if she did something wrong. I don't condone hitting and in my family we never and I will never with my daughter, I have expressed this many a times but it seems to go over her head. Also my mother in law has had her younger daughter removed from their home several times over the past few years from being hit etc. i just don't feel she is a very good person to have around my daughter especially when she is so hot and cold with my partner in their relationship. 
My partner has now reconciled with his mum and has come home saying she wants to see my daughter and that she has reluctantly agreed to have us there as she felt she was entitled to have my daughter on her own without us. Which to me is crazy seeing how she doesn't know my daughter and vice versa. 
I said I would like to meet for coffee with her (I am blocked on everything) and he to tell her that, as I feel I shouldn't introduce my daughter without meeting with the mum to see if things actually have changed. 
I don't know what to do, I understand it's his mum but at the end of the day. My daughter is my priority and not both their feelings. My gut says to not allow this but I don't know how to go around it or handle this. ",8,1737968038.0,motherinlawsfromhell,8,1.0,False

met this girl at a halloween party in 2023 and we clicked. had mutual friends and everything it was awesome. 

we responded to each other’s stories a lot cause we have similar interests. we’d also respond to each other’s stories and compliment each other a lot. but i thought they were just being friendly so i didn’t think much of it. but then in july 2024, they asked to get coffee with me. 

it was okay ig, they paid for my food and stuff, didn’t do much after that but we tried prolonging the hangout as much as we could. they suggested we go to an arcade as a 2nd hangout but never followed up after that…

so, for months, i just lowkey yearned and always kinda lurking their cf story 😅😅 we kinda started doing separate things, i tried filling the void by talking to other people but nothing rlly stuck with me cause they were lowkey just not it, idk. 

in october/november, i reconsidered keeping my silence and funny enough, they started posting about going on dates with some girl and i was fucking livid. like genuinely seething, i was losing my fucking mind for weeks 😭. i was praying it would stop and it seems to have stopped cause they haven’t posted about it anymore. 

i was pussy with it ngl so i waited until January to make a suggestion that we hang out and see a movie. yes, it was wicked. i paid for our tix and everything. it was fun. we hung out again a week later and they took me to their fav pho place, was really fucking good. 

my thing is, i cannot tell if they want me or are just being friendly. like we all know how women/afabs (they’re an enby lesbian and i’m bi/pan [honestly, i might be a lesbian cause i’ve rendered men utterly useless]) can be. i really like them so idk what to do. 

we’re hanging out again this friday and going thrifiting. i wanna apply more pressure just so i can know if it’s heading in the direction that i want it go in. but i just don’t know how to go about it. someone PLEASE HELP MEEEEE. like literally idk what to do and how to make it clear that i want them without being super pushy or making them uncomfortable 🤤

they make me so nervous bro i’m gonna run into a wall. like i feel like i sound like a complete nunce when i speak to them. they always insist on paying for things, even our ubers. and they always respond to my story when i post myself, and i do too…👀👀👀 but friends can do that for each other too, right? friends call each other’s wife and mama and talk about doing matching cosplays of wlw mlp ships right 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 

we’re also going to comic con in march 👀 we wanted to do something matchy but it might be out of the budget, which is fine. i just rlly was excited to match.

TLDR; i want an enby lesbian and idk how to make it clear that i want them without making them uncomfortable or fucking up completely cause i enjoy our hangouts. i also havent dated anyone in 6 years and that was a fucking man who would beat my ass. i need someone with credentials to help me out",1,1737967989.0,WLW,0,1.0,False
1ib3ueg,/r/SIBO/comments/1ib0pwj/feeling_better_than_2_years_ago/,Feeling better than 2 years ago …,"Feeling better than 2 years ago …

My battle started almost 2 years ago. I don’t 100% know if I have SIBO, but I’ve suspected it. There was about a 8 months-a year where I truly didn’t know if my life was going to get better. My life came to a halt. I couldn’t eat, I wasn’t working, no traveling, no working out, just doing my best to survive every day. I always told myself that if I ever got to a point where I felt like I was mostly normal again, I would post and give hope to others. I’m so happy to say that since May of 2024, things have looked up drastically. I am eating and drinking what I love, not missing events, slowly getting back into working out (I had to have an iron infusion in May of 2024 so I’ve taken it very slow), and I am seeing significantly more good days than bad days. Here’s some background of my personal experience:

May of 2023: Took iron supplements for 2 weeks. My iron is very low because I have endometriosis & bleed a lot. Those supplements made me constipated for the entirety of those 2 weeks. This is what I’m suspecting gave me SIBO. 

The symptoms came all at once. Here were the most debilitating for me: acid reflux (in many many forms, examples: burning feeling in throat, feeling like I needed to throw up any time I ate, chest pain, stomach burning), nausea, weakness, anxiety, bloating, lightheadedness, and just the inability to eat or drink an ounce of anything without feeling it was going to come right back up. 

This period was hands down the hardest period of my life so far (btw I am a 26F). It was filled with every doctor appt you could think of (endoscopy, extensive stool test, HIDA scan for gallbladder function, multiple blood tests, CT scans, X-rays, I know I’m forgetting a lot). It was such a blur. Everything came back normal of course except for my iron levels. The only thing my endoscopy showed is inflammation of my throat and some acid. Was prescribed omeprazole per my doctor, NEVER took it and to this day I am so grateful for that decision, and it’s because of reddit that I didn’t. It’s amazing what you can learn from reddit that your doctors don’t even know. 

After much research on Reddit throughout those months, I was starting to connect the dots. All of my symptoms aligned with SIBO-C and/or low stomach acid. I don’t need any testing to know that I have low stomach acid. You need enough stomach acid to digest food, and my food would never digest fully. A lot of people think since they have acid reflux, they must have too much acid. Reddit taught me that 90% of the time, it’s because you don’t have enough stomach acid. Well, omeprazole is a stomach acid reducer. If I had taken that per my doctor, I would have been so much worse than I already was. Not only that, but I also learned that omeprazole is NOT to be taken long term, and that you have to wean yourself off of it or you’ll get rebound-reflux (basically acid reflux but 10x worse). Neither of these things were told to me by my doctor. He wanted me on it regularly. 

At this point, I knew I didn’t have enough stomach acid at least. So how do I fix that part? My wonderful & supportive boyfriend did some research along with me during this time. There were 2 things we consistently came across: Digestive Enzymes/Bitters and Apple Cider Vinegar. We read some conflicting things regarding how hard the enzymes/bitters can be. We also read that Apple cider vinegar is super acidic and inflammatory, at least the liquid form is. But we read wonderful things about Apple cider vinegar capsules. 

I was too scared to buy them and try it, because what if I was wrong? My boyfriend bought them anyways and tried it before I did to show me that I would be safe (I know our bodies our different and it didn’t necessary mean I wouldn’t react to it, but it did bring me comfort and enough to make me try it).

It took about 3 days to feel a difference, but since then, my life has been changed completely. My food wasn’t coming back up, my stomach wasn’t burning as much, I was actually getting an appetite back, it was truly a miracle. With that, I have also started taking DGL. DGL helps coat your stomach. I take DGL 20 minutes before eating, and my ACV capsule right before my first bite of food. I do this 3x a day. 

I know that I am not cured and still have a long way to go, but I would say that I am 85% back to normal. I have my flare ups of course, but so does everyone. I’m working full time again, I’m working out, eating my favorite foods without limitation, drinking my sweet coffee again, and I never thought I would be one to post a good update on this thread. I always told myself I would post because all you ever see is the panic and uncertainty (understandably). I used to be one who would panic-post all of the time. It took over my life and I never thought I’d feel close to normal again. I still have to try to nail the SIBO aspect, but for right now, I am functioning just fine and to me that’s all that matters. I hope this post brings someone some peace and comfort. I am always open to answer any questions at any time. ❤️",3,1737967982.0,SiboSuccessStories,1,1.0,False

**SPOILER WARNING: Since this is a rewatch, it's assumed that anyone in these discussions has already seen the entire show, so all spoilers are allowed.**


Day 126 brings us to ""The Golden Hammer,"" which begins with a crazed man smashing into multiple cars before getting out half naked and running through the streets of Austin. He arrives at an office, where he collapses at his office and dies. While Kim reads them in, an FBI higher-up arrives and calls her outside. Lisbon notices Jane's reading their lips and pesters him with questions, disrupting his eavesdropping. They bicker about their partnership dynamic while Cho watches awkwardly. The man comes in and informs Jane that he doesn't have adequate clearance for the case. Abbott comes in and says his security clearance is approved, something few civilians receive. Jane is thrilled, and he asks for the skinny on Area 51.

Title relevance: Not sure about this one either, but a golden hammer is a term for a person's over-reliance on a single skill. Could be a reference to Avery doing the same thing each time to sell information?

Notable guest stars: Devon Gummersall (from My So Called Life), Pat Skipper (from Bosch), Navid Negahban (I just watched him in S2 of The Night Agent!), Travis Schuldt (from Heathers and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia), Brian Patrick Wade (from Agents of SHIELD)

Location: Houston, TX


Notable scenes: 
- Kim, Lisbon, and Jane search the victim Charles Whitaker's apartment with his brother. Jane takes a newspaper from the apartment and tells Kim he'll call if he needs anything.
- Kim and Lisbon head to Charles's office, Cartesian, where they speak to his bosses and coworkers with the company lawyer present. They reveal they work in counterintelligence.
- Oswaldo Ardilles calls Lisbon and asks to have dinner. He's working in the private sector now.
- Jane finds letters circled in the newspaper and decodes a message, having found a ""spy newspaper.""
- Cho and Jane follow clues from Wiley to a park, until Jane finds the bench the spy newspaper was left on. 
- Lisbon calls Jane and asks where he is. He says he's ""on the scent of murder like a bloodhound,"" then scares Kim and Lisbon from the backseat of Kim's car. Lisbon says she's got a date, and Jane looks bothered by her use of the word ""date.""
- At dinner, Ardilles tells Lisbon that he's been feeling paranoid lately, thinking he's being bugged. She says she'll refer him to Grace and Wayne, because they're in digital security now.
- The next day, Lisbon fills Jane in, and Jane suggests that maybe Ardilles just wanted a date with her, saying Ardilles always had a crush on her. While Lisbon gets coffee, a man picks up the spy newspaper. Jane intercepts him by causing a scene, and they take him back to the FBI office. He turns out to be an information broker.
- Jane realizes that the Cartesian spy still hasn't sold their information, and he pitches an idea, but Abbott turns it down, saying it's illegal. When Jane says they'll have to think outside the box, Lisbon says that's always a bad sign. Jane approaches Charles's brother and tries to get him to assault him. Jane whispers something in his ear, and he punches his arm very awkwardly, and Jane groans so that Cho can arrest him for battery.
- With Charles's brother in ""custody,"" Kim and Lisbon set the trap by letting the company know what happened, so that they can convince the seller to try again. 
- Grace and Rigsby (carrying an infant) talk to Ardilles, and he hires them to look into who's stalking him. As Ardilles leaves their house, someone watches him.
- Lisbon and Jane sit on a bench during their stakeout, and Jane reminisces about the old days and says he's cheerful because he gets to sit in a park with her on a beautiful day. The spy turns out to be Avery Schultz, the company secretary. Jane tells Lisbon she looks great in her big floppy hat.

Nothing out of the ordinary but I had a realisation of sorts. That the setting of meeting at a loud bar and drinking alcohol was in a sense the antithesis of connection or making friends. The format is shouting to one another because its too loud to have speak properly. There is too much stimulus as well - loud music, lots of people - to think or speak in a mindful manner. 

It got me thinking that our whole culture around ''going out' and drinking is therefore ironic in many ways. Just considering how so often its typically the worst way to actually connect with anyone on a deeper level then just shouting at each other in a loud bar. 

I realised that pretty much all of the people there were interesting individuals who had their own inner light. Yet, it was in fact very hard to build rapport with any of them given the setting. You are reduced to generic small talk and jokes but that is it. In other words, the possibility of having meaningful connection with anyone is zero.

It struck me as perverse as I had this thought that 'here we are, all together, yet completely unconnected. And we're all drinking alcohol which is numbing us even further from ourselves and from each other.' And again, the typical bar is not a nice place to be sober. It's an overstimulating. stressful environment. And it's no wonder people feel compelled to drink in those places.

The best conversations are to be had in a coffee shop or taking a walk with friends outdoors. 

Suffice to say - it made me realise that alcohol = fun / connection is a massive massive lie. It takes you further away from yourself and other people. Just crazy how conditioned society is to make us believe it is the other way round. ",7,1737967405.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

I’m a 35-year-old introvert from the Netherlands, looking to connect with someone from the EU who’s interested in meaningful conversations and shared quiet moments. Bonus points if you're also Dutch—makes spontaneous coffee dates a little easier—but I don’t mind traveling for the right person.

A bit about me:

Personality: I’m structured, reliable, and grounded. Think of me as the steady type—loyal, thoughtful, and a bit reserved until I feel comfortable.

Interests: I’m more of a ""walk in the park"" kind of guy than a ""scream at a concert"" one. Loud crowds and big events? Not really my thing. I’d rather enjoy a peaceful stroll or a quiet evening talking about life. I’m also a fan of fantasy worlds like The Witcher and Warhammer, so if you enjoy those too, we might already have something in common.

Values: Fairness and honesty are super important to me, both in life and relationships. I’m introspective and appreciate someone who enjoys deep, meaningful connections over small talk.


What I’m looking for:

A kind, grounded woman who values the little things in life—like quiet moments, thoughtful conversations, and just spending time together.

Ideally, someone from the Netherlands or nearby (makes those weekend meetups easier). But if you’re elsewhere in the EU, don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m happy to travel for the right person.

Patience and a sense of humor are always appreciated. Introverts like me take time to open up, but when I do, you’ll have a partner who’s all in.


Random bonus points if you:

Enjoy nature walks and exploring new places at a relaxed pace.

Share an interest in nerdy topics like fantasy, gaming, or tech.

I'm a first time mum and as my baby transitioned from infant to toddler, it has become a nightmare. But only with me, the mum. 

From the moment he wakes up, it's immediate screeching, crying, fussing, and non stop physical combativeness. I'm starting to dread the days where he isn't at daycare. Changing a nappy is a battle, telling him no is a battle, feeding him meals is a battle, bathing him is a battle, dressing him is a battle, putting him in a car seat and any length of a drive is a battle, spending time with him on pram walks or going outside only lasts 20 minutes because he turns into a screeching, crying, kicking, and slapping nightmare. Even just looking at him will trigger a meltdown at least 50% of the time and I just don't understand. It's almost as though every time he gets reminded that I am nearby or around, he just flips a switch and starts being a nightmare. My husband can do everything that I do with 0 fussing, then leave him in the play pen while he does some dishes or makes himself a meal or coffee, and our baby will just play independently perfectly content for long stretches of time. As soon as I come downstairs and he catches a glimpse of me, that's it, it starts. Absolute meltdowns.

It has gotten to a point where my husband and I have agreed that I won't come downstairs in the mornings if hes doing our sons morning routine, because he just goes nuts when he realises I'm there. On the days I do the morning routines, no one in a mile radius is gonna get to sleep in. My husband does night shifts regularly so you can image the kind of strain this is putting on him as well when he can't sleep in on those mornings. I try to take him out of the house so my husband can sleep, but by the time I'm done feeding breakfast etc, it has been a solid hour of ear peircing screeching and my husband is fully awake. At first my husband didn't understand or fully believe how bad the situation had gotten, until I set up our security cameras in full view of the rooms that baby and I spend all our time in when we're at home. He was shocked and genuinly felt like he was looking at a different baby due to the drastic change in behavior with me vs with dad. He will screech and scream-cry when I change his nappy, kicking and slapping at my face or whatever he can reach, feeding him is the same deal so it can take a solid hour or more to hand feed him a meal, where it takes my husband no more than 15 minutes. If he catches me looking at him, he will start crying and fussing. And God forbid I ever have to say no or move him away from something he shouldn't be touching or somewhere he shouldn't be going, that's a 20 minute meltdown guaranteed. 

I'm so sad to say, I haven't had any good moments with him since he was about 11 months old. Even when he is just wandering around playing, he will do so while actively scream-crying if I'm around. It is so bizarre and I really don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm constantly covered in scratches, bruises and red marks from the slapping, kicking, and biting. I just want some advice on what the hell I'm doing wrong. I have never yelled at or laid a finger on him ever. I know that will be an assumption people make, I cant even imagine what our neighbours must think. The disciplinarian in the family is my husband, and even then, our son responds very well whenever my husband tells him no or stop. No fussing or tantrum, just sulks for a second then carries on doing something else no issues. If I try to do the same, all hell breaks loose. 

The closest way I can describe it is that he seems to love me and hate me at the same time. I'm so unbelievably burnt out, and the highlight of my day is when he goes down for a nap so I can have at least 1 hour of no ear peircing screeching. Ive always felt that the sound of a baby crying affects me way more than considered normal, so this new phase my baby has entered into is heavily affecting me.

I've had ADHD my whole life and I know I get easily overstimulated especially by sound. The sound of my baby crying just immediately puts me into this fight or flight mode, and I'm immediately agitated/stressed.
I feel terrible saying this, but the best my mental state has been since this started was when I recently had a 2 week ICU hospital stay. I was very sick from septic shock, but I had no stress of worrying about screeching, crying, and getting slapped, bitten, and kicked. I cried in the hospital bathroom the day I was discharged because I knew what I was coming back to. I love my son with all my heart, but I'm really at my witts end. Any advice on why this could be happening and how to correct it would be so so so appreciated. ",6,1737966753.0,beyondthebump,6,0.88,False

1ib3jy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ib3jy9/aitah_for_thinking_of_cutting_ties_with_my_family/,AITAH for thinking of cutting ties with my family and friends after my baby shower??,"I am 35 weeks pregnant and just had my shower. My dear friend flew a long way to throw the shower for me in my apartment and she stayed in our living room while she was here. I was beyond grateful (and still am) that she would come all this way and that she threw the shower, but it ended up stressing me out a lot more than I realized with cleaning and I did all the cooking for the shower and then preparing to have her stay with us as well. It felt a bit like I was throwing it for myself. 

We were not telling most people the gender of our baby, just our closest family and friends. I found myself slipping up with pronouns which meant a few extra people found out the gender before the shower. The shower was gender neutral and the invite specifically said not to ruin the gender surprise. Several gifts clearly identified the gender. The first thing the host said when we started the shower was literally the gender of the baby. Come to find out my mom had told all of her friends the gender as well and they also revealed the baby's gender, so several people who I really wanted to tell and surprise who are important to me felt like they were the last people to know and now are understably angry with me. 

The day of the shower, our apartment complex lost all water because of a water main break. My mom was extremely irritated when I asked if she could bring over water for the party (my husband had our one car so I couldn't get it) and wanted to move the shower to her house. She is a huge smoker and has two gigantic untrained and loud dogs. Besides this, my parents are divorced and my dad's side of the family wouldn't be comfortable going to her house, so I declined. At the shower she brought up several times that she offered to have it at her house and made it seem like I was being so inconsiderate for forcing people to come to my house. Several guests refused to eat or drink and made a point to tell me because we had no water, but we got tons of jugs of water so the toilet would be operable and I communicated that several times. My mom was also meant to pick up the coffee for the shower. She sent her friend to pick up the water and the coffee and PAY for the coffee instead of going herself. Her friend showed up 30 minutes late for the shower even though the coffee was meant to be picked up 45 minutes before the shower began. I of course don't blame her because those were meant to be things my mom would help with. I didn't force those tasks on my mom, she repeatedly offered to pick things up for me because we only have one car.

A dear friend (J) drove four hours to come to my shower, and I have always just adored her and been so grateful for our friendship. She's old enough to be my mom, and I was really shocked that after the shower, she literally sulked in my house for several hours. She wouldn't talk to me or my friend who planned the shower, only my husband. When I opened her gifts, I thanked her repeatedly and genuinely. I told her that my husband would bring pizza home after work that day for dinner and when he did she told me (for the first time) she's gluten free and dairy free. When I lived in the same area as her, I am very confident she ate gluten and dairy and she hadn't communicated that dietary restriction with me even though I told her a week in advance what my husband would bring for dinner. I offered her salad and all kinds of other things but she refused and was irritated with me for offering. I have gone through the whole day and the only other interaction I think she could have been offended by was this: 

Before many people arrived to the shower, I asked my mom to turn on the lamp right next to her because I felt it was a bit dark in the room. My older friend (J) looked at me and was like ""You think it's dark in here?!"" And I said yes. Then she did this weird thing where she was like ""look at me"" over and over and so I did but was really uncomfortable and not sure what was happening. Then she kept telling me to take a breath. I was not anxious or stressed at all and I wasn't upset, so I just said ""I'm really not stressed out or upset at all, I just wanted the lamp on"" and she insisted and would not stop until I took a breath. She and my mom started making fun of me saying I was going to put myself in labor. 

After everyone left, I was very upset because my paternal grandmother, who also opted out of attending my wedding because she thought I was selfish for the timing of it (which was out of my control), didn't come to the shower and wasn't sick or unwell, she just didn't want to see my mom. I felt that my grandma would never show up for me or my baby in big live events. I was really hurt and upset by this as well as some other passive aggressive things my mom and aunt did throughout the day, and I was talking it through with my friend who planned the shower. My older friend (J) continuously defended my mom and seemed irritated with me for being hurt about it. My mom was abusive to me as a kid, and I'm past it, but the point is that theres a lot of context to our relationship that I never talked about with J, but my friend who planned the shower did know about so she saw a lot of the same issues that I did. 

While I was opening gifts, there was a really sweet card that I just adored. I have a very distant cousin who came to the shower, and her daughter in law was invited at the very last minute because of miscommunication with the friend hosting the shower. I felt that the last minute invite was very rude because I had never met the daughter in law before and I just felt really bad about it. But the daughter in law had her children handmake a sweet sweet card and just gave me the kindest gift. I was so so pleased and grateful and surprised, but my cousin said ""it's not that nice of a card."" When I then opened a gift from my cousin, I was thanking her and explaining how grateful I was and how useful the gift will be and she just said ""I mean it was on your registry so."" All throughout opening gifts, I was just so grateful for some really unexpected generosity and I felt that some friends had just been so overly kind so I was a bit emotional. My mom and my friend (J) mentioned previously consistently made fun of me for being emotional. When I opened gifts from J, one of them wasn't clear what it was-- it wasn't labeled anywhere, it was just vaccum sealed white fabric of some kind so I had a hard time figuring out what it was. She was offended I guess and loudly made fun of me for not knowing what I put on my own registry. Several other times, she's insulted what I put on my registry saying she doesn't think it's that nice, but she ""had"" to buy off the registry. I opened another gift from my aunt, and she responded with ""I mean you needed it, they wouldn't let you take home the baby without it"" in a tone that seemed like she meant ""well I had to buy it"" if that makes sense. She wasn't happy at all when I thanked her. These comments made me feel stupid, like I was being just over dramatic in thanking people or like I was making a fool out of myself, but I was being very genuine. I wasn't putting on any kind of show. 

So many friends were so kind to me during the shower, and I am so genuinely grateful, but I also feel so bitterly disappointed and upset about the other relationships and how things went. Am I being too sensitive? I feel a bit like I want to protect my baby from some of these dynamics so they don't ever feel like family doesn't show up for them or like they're a burden to others the way my family has made me feel. I've never posted before but I just feel that too much happened for me to process it without input from others. Am I being a jerk and expected too much? Am I being overly dramatic or failing to see how something I've done is thoughtless? Are these behaviors (which all have a history before them) rational for distancing myself from these relationships? ",2,1737966584.0,AITAH,6,0.67,False

My friend Bruchy asked this question in our Abundance Circle.

And for homework, we had to answer it every hour, on the hour.

That's at least 12 times a day.

36 dreams a day.



The first few answers were really big and exciting:

😍 I've always wanted to travel the world and now I do.

😍 I wanted to own my time and with my business, I do.

😍 I dreamed of leaving NY and I got to move to Israel.



But then you could totally feel a block.

How do I come up with 36 of these A DAY?

My girl Bruchy knows what she's doing. 😏



Not every dream is so big.

You can also dream about the delicious coffee you're gonna have.



And the friends you're gonna meet.

And the client you're gonna close.

And the date you're gonna go on.



Let me tell you.

It is almost SCARY how quickly I've manifested new dreams into my reality.

I HIGHLY recommend this practice. 



Even for just a week.

Try it and tell me how it goes.



P.S. Why not start right now? What are 3 dreams you had that are now your reality? 👇

1ib3ac3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1ib3ac3/things_i_can_do_to_help_my_wife/,Things I can do to help my wife,"Hey everyone, I am new here. Apologies for the long post. But I am feeling a bit lost and in need of help.

Wife (26F) and I (30M) have been married for almost 3 years now. She's a teacher and I'm working in the Software industry (mostly working from home). We've been wanting to have kids for the better part of the last 2 years. However, wife had to go through a surgery (craniotomy) in mid 2023 and the meds she had to take for recovery put our plans firmly on pause.

The doctor advised to stop the meds somewhere around March last year. We've been trying for months and finally it happened! We are pregnant!!

We are so happy and it still feels surreal. The more this feeling settles in, the more I'm realising how clueless I am to this.

I have a few questions I'd love some opinions on.

1. What is a good morning drink to start the day?
   * Both of us are (forced) early birds. We wake up around 5.30 to prepare for the day. So we have a cup of black coffee in the morning before we go to work. But we have stopped coffee as it is not good for the baby.
   * She likes to drink something I make for her (even if it tastes like dishwater sometimes lol). What are good alternatives I can try? She likes to drink black tea, but I hear it has caffeine as well. Neither of us like to drink milk. I'm out of sorts here.
   * Right now we are drinking a cup of hot water as a substitute. Please help!
2. Are we working too much to focus on the pregnancy?
   * I am working full time (albeit from home) and I am reading for my Master's degree. Which leaves me little time to help her out more than what I'm doing now.
   * I am leaving my current company to a new one in hopes to be less overworked than in my current position. But it's still a new place where I probably have to focus a little extra to set a good starting impression.
   * She's teaching for Cambridge exam students (both ordinary and advanced level). Which is a little bit stressful in her mind but she is doing a great job at it.
   * In addition to this, she is teaching in an online academy in the evenings. She's not a fan of this though. I am feeling a little guilty about this as I was the one who pushed her to try this to see if it works out as a potential alternative career (from the school) for her.
   * She is reading for her Master's degree and she has to start her thesis in the upcoming weeks. The submission of the thesis will likely fall close to the potential delivery date.
   * This over-busy schedule was a ""3 year plan"" we came up for both of us to complete our higher studies and plan for a better future. We knew this would mean sacrifices have to be made with time for each other. Stupidly enough, we never considered a child in this equation even though that's exactly what we wanted.
   * Does this seem too much for us to handle?
3. What to expect/prepare for?
   * I think we are 4-6 weeks into the pregnancy right now. What can we expect in the coming weeks/months? What are things we need to prepare for? What are things I should prepare for?

Beyond these, I am looking for general advice on what I can do to help my wife during the pregnancy. Videos/articles to read that can be helpful, things I can make for her, activities/exercises we can do, things NOT TO DO, etc. etc.

Thank you so much in advance for taking the time to read through my ramblings. Any help is highly appreciated.
