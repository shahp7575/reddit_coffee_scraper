1pphmnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1pphmnl/does_she_seem_interested_and_should_i_ask_her_out/,Does she seem interested and should I ask her out?,"Hi everyone, I need some advice. This might be a long post, but I’d really appreciate any feedback.

**As a guy, I understand that just because a girl is nice, it doesn’t necessarily mean she’s interested. But hear me out.**

I met a girl at a volunteer place. I’m a volunteer, and she works part-time as a barista at the coffee shop there. I see her every weekend. We’re 7 years apart—I just turned 27 and she’s 20. Is that weird? I figured since we’re both in our 20s, it shouldn’t be.

Lately, I’ve really been enjoying our conversations. One thing that stands out is how engaging she is. Since there aren’t many customers, I’ll often stand at the counter and we’ll talk for 3–5 minutes, sometimes even 10. We talk about our week, our day, things going on in our lives, holiday plans, etc. She asks questions that keep the conversation going, and when things start to die down, she’ll bring up a random topic to continue it. I do the same, of course. You're probably thinking, she wants tips... Bare in mind that she works at a non-profit organization and she's also not allowed to receive tips.

She also remembers things we talked about before and follows up on them the next time I see her. For example:

* I mentioned doing a strict water fast, and the next week she asked how it was going. That led to her opening up about her mom’s breast cancer diagnosis and how she went vegan to support her.
* I told her about my AI prompt engineering certification, and she asked the following week how it was going.
* She asks if I went to a car show when I come in on Saturdays (I go pretty often).
* When she sees me, she’ll ask if I just got in or if I’ve been there a while.

She also notices my schedule. One time I came in early and she said, “Are you here earlier today?” Another time, after I’d missed a few Sundays, she asked, “You come in on Sundays??”

After Thanksgiving, she asked if I went Black Friday shopping, then excitedly told me—without me asking—that she bought stuff at Sephora because it was 50% off. I thought that was kinda cute, lol.

**Another thing that stood out:** a few weeks ago, I mentioned my sister is visiting from Singapore for Christmas and wants to go to San Francisco. She excitedly said, “I’m from the Bay Area!” She asked if I knew the small city she’s from and mentioned she’d be back in NorCal for Christmas and said “Maybe I’ll see you.”

A couple months ago, she asked me to remind her which church I go to and whether I’m part of any groups (I’m not). She said she knows someone who might go to the same church and be in a group. Does that mean she was thinking about me?

Writing all this out makes me feel like our conversations might be surface-level, but to be fair, she’s at work when we talk. Still, the way she keeps the conversation going is something I’ve never really experienced before.

I’ll admit I’m pretty blind when it comes to signs from girls—my friends tell me that all the time. I’d really love to hear your thoughts from a third-person POV, especially from women.

If you think these are all great signs, how should i proceed? Since I love volunteering there, just in case I face rejection and risk ending up in an awkward situation, what is the best and most casual way to ask her out?

Thanks in advance, and Merry Christmas! 🎄

The moments when I feel most clear headed and grounded are not when I am pushing harder or trying to be productive, but when I deliberately slow down. Walking without headphones, making coffee in silence, or simply sitting with my thoughts has started to feel more meaningful than I expected.

For a long time I believed progress only came from effort and constant motion. Now I am realizing that reflection plays just as important a role. When I give myself space, I start to understand what actually matters to me, not what I thought should matter. I see patterns in my choices, the habits I want to keep, and the ones I am ready to let go of.

This shift has not made me less ambitious. If anything, it has made my goals feel more honest. I feel calmer, but also more intentional. It makes me wonder how many of us confuse noise with direction.

I am curious if anyone else has experienced something similar. When did you realize that slowing down was not falling behind, but actually moving forward in a different way?",2,1766031508.0,self,0,1.0,False

I know thanks to this sub and other resources that it’s normal to go the other way when breastfeeding, however I’m approaching 350lbs and quite frankly don’t have the wiggle room to gain any more. I made very healthy choices while pregnant and only gained ‘baby weight’ which dropped off within 2 weeks of giving birth. I was stoked.

In the three months since, I’ve gained it all back and then some.

It is stressing me out. I drink enough water, I prioritise protein and fibre, I meal plan and meal prep and calorie count (2,500 a day for my size and breastfeeding taken into account which should be more than enough) and yet I’m still so freaking hungry all the time. I struggle to ignore it. I have a drink or a coffee, or a protein-rich snack, or even a meal… an hour later I’m ravenous again.

1pphiag,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pphiag,A soft outfit for a brave moment(Tomorrow),"I wanted to share this tonight because tomorrow I’m doing something that feels small on paper, but massive in my chest.

Tomorrow, I’m going to step outside as me — not fully “done,” not perfectly confident, not fearless — just honest. A casual outfit, a cup of coffee, and a short walk. That’s it. And somehow, it feels like crossing a whole damn ocean.

I’ve spent a long time thinking I had to wait until everything was right — the body, the makeup, the confidence, the certainty. But what I’m learning (slowly, stubbornly) is that courage doesn’t show up after confidence. It shows up first, shaky and imperfect, and confidence follows later if you let it.

I’m sharing this because I know I’m not alone here.

If you’re reading this and thinking:

“I want to, but I’m not ready yet”

“I don’t look like I should”

“What if people stare?”

“What if I lose my nerve?”


Yeah. Same. All of it.

But I also know how powerful it was for me to see others here take their first steps — not as some flawless reveal, but as real people choosing themselves anyway. Those posts mattered more to me than the polished ones. They gave me permission to try.

So this is me trying.

Not to prove anything.
Not to be brave all the time.
Just to take one honest step and see how it feels.

If you’re on a similar path — wherever you are on it — I hope this reminds you that you don’t have to be perfect to move forward. You just have to be kind enough to yourself to take the next step.

I’ll check back in after the walk 💜

1pphgi1,https://i.redd.it/7hg9i6j81w7g1.png,"He's My Enemy, My Greatest Love","My father died in the same bed as my childhood friend's mother. When they were found, their lower bodies were still locked together.

From that moment on, Mitchell and I became mortal enemies.

He drove a car straight into my father’s funeral.

I smashed his mother’s urn on the dock and scattered her ashes into the sea.

Our hatred consumed us, sharp and venomous. We spent ten years wounding each other until we finally wore ourselves out.

He took his crew and left for Mexico.

I stayed in New York and became the city's most sought-after bounty hunter.

But when we met again years later, he was neither my enemy nor the boy I once knew.

He walked into the morgue—into the room where I was lying.

Years later, we finally got the chance to faced each other in silence.

Chapter 1

After finishing my job, I hurried back to the small bakery I used as a front to tend to my injuries.

The wall-mounted TV showed Mitchell Harvey's return.

The former golden boy of New York's elite circles, now Mexico's top arms dealer, was back in town. Of course, it was headline news.

I roughly bandaged my wound and moved toward the small memorial corner I kept for my father.

Suddenly, a girl with chin-length hair burst into the shop.

She looked serious but spoke loudly. Clutching red roses, she pointed at the display case. ""I'll take everything here!""

Close behind was Roderick Dunlap, Mitchell's best friend and right-hand man.

When he saw me, he froze, his expression tightening. ""Yas, maybe we should go somewhere else?""

The girl refused immediately. ""No way!

""I brought Mitch desserts from here before. He said they were amazing. It's his birthday today. I need to get more.""

She gave me a pleading look. ""Ma'am, my fiancé's returning today. He loves your pastries. Could I use your space for a birthday surprise?""

I couldn't refuse, so I nodded.

""Could we get some extra desserts?"" she asked.

I agreed, noticing my fresh bandage was already bleeding through.

I hid my hand under my apron and walked unsteadily toward the kitchen.

It wasn't fear or nostalgia.

My illness was flaring up again.

It was incurable.

""Roderick, we're running out of time! Help me set up! Mitch's gonna be here any minute, and I want everything perfect.""

Roderick didn't move.

He knew Mitchell was never happy to see me.

On the news broadcast, Mitchell smiled for the cameras, yet his eyes remained cold.

""I'm sure she's watching too. I'm looking forward to... seeing her again.""

Chapter 2

The camera zoomed in, highlighting the scar bisecting his eyebrow.

It was my doing, with a knife.

I was having a bad day, and he was there. So, I attacked him.

The ugly scar on my neck was his doing. He crushed a glass and used a shard to attack me.

Again, there was no deep motive.

We had a simple understanding: hurt the other, get hurt in return. We liked seeing each other in pain.

The news anchor smiled suggestively. ""Planning a long stay, Mr. Harvey? Those roses... Are you meeting someone special?""

He paused, his voice low. ""My fiancée.""

In the shop, the girl was adjusting roses in a candelabra. She glanced up at the TV.

""Roderick,"" she said, ""I heard Mitch had some messy history with a girl here for ten years. You know anything about that?""

I kept my head down, polishing a knife, but felt Roderick's gaze flicker toward me.

""Mitch!"" Her shout cut through the tension.

She forgot her umbrella and dashed outside.

""Yas.""

Mitchell caught her in a one-armed hug, his umbrella shielding her from the rain.

She rose on her toes and pressed a quick, rain-damp kiss to his lips.

I thought I saw him lean back, just slightly.

Then his eyes found mine through the wet glass.

The girl tried to turn, but he cupped her chin and kissed her again, deeper this time.

I looked away and snipped the ribbon I was holding.

Roderick approached.

""Paulette,"" he said, voice low. ""It's his birthday. For one night, could you just not anger him?""

He hesitated, seeming to think of something. ""She's nineteen. Clean slate. Reminds him of you before.""

I nodded, my fingers feeling numb.

""She's pretty. Prettier than I was.""

The door opened. Mitchell stood there, folding his black umbrella.

""Discussing my fiancée?""

His tone was light, but his stare was cold as it rested on me.

Chapter 3

Roderick watched me, holding his breath.

He was waiting for one of my classic outbursts.

Instead, I simply pushed the boxed cake toward them. ""Your dark chocolate cheesecake.""

Yasmine Murphy gazed at Mitchell with adoration. ""Try it, Mitch. Is this your favorite?""

He took a sip of coffee, rubbing the edge of the cup, before cutting a small piece with the silver dessert fork.

""Bitter. Unpleasantly so. Not for me.""

His tone was light, his eyes smiling as he teased Yasmine.

She looked confused and took a bite herself. ""It's delicious! You're lying to me again!""

She didn't see that his gaze remained fixed on me over her head.

Suddenly, the door chime jangled loudly.

""Hey, Mitch! Welcome back!""

A few men crowded in, their laughter cutting off abruptly when they saw me.

Their eyes followed me, wary and questioning, before turning to Roderick.

I carried over the pot of lemonade. The men flinched in unison, raising their hands defensively, as if I were holding acid.

Back when Mitchell and I were at each other's throats, his crew got caught in the crossfire a few times.

It was never anything serious, just minor incidents. I was surprised they still reacted this way.

Someone nudged Roderick. ""Roddy, what's she doing here?""

Roderick just shrugged, not explaining.

""Enjoy your lemonade,"" I said, turning to leave.

Yasmine caught my wrist. ""Wait! Could you take a picture for us?""

""No,"" I said, calmly removing her hand.

I'd only taken a few steps when a figure moved to block my path.

I looked up to see Mitchell's gloomy face. ""I know how this works,"" he said, his voice flat. ""Everything has a price. So name it. How much to get you to...""

He paused deliberately, waiting for me to react. When I didn't, he finished coldly. ""Take a picture for us.""

I looked him over and tried to step around him.

A sharp pressure on a nerve in my arm sent a jolt of pain through me, and my legs gave way. I fell to my knees. A black card was flung down, its edge catching my cheek and drawing a thin line of blood.

""That's more than enough to make you disappear.""

I pushed myself back to my feet, my fingers gingerly touching the cut, my eyes fixed on Mitchell.

Yasmine quickly stepped between us, her smile strained. ""Mitch, stop it, okay?

""Sorry, miss. He must have had too much to drink.""

But he didn't smell of alcohol. He was simply picking a fight, same as always.

It convinced me he'd been having such a good time abroad that he'd forgotten who he was dealing with.

I bent down, picked up the black card, and stood facing him again.

His friends let out a low laugh.

""Some things never change. She still jumps for money.""

He held out his phone with a confident smirk, pleased by my apparent cooperation.

I moved fast. I grabbed his jaw, scraped the edge of the card through a thick glob of chocolate frosting, and shoved it into his mouth.

I didn't stop until I smelled blood. Then I grabbed two glasses from the table and poured the liquor down his throat.

""Consider your mouth cleaned,"" I said.

I turned and slapped the man who had spoken. ""Learn when to keep quiet.""

The whole thing was over in seconds. No one else moved. The only sound was the rain hitting the windows.

Roderick, leaning against the far wall, drained his glass and sighed heavily. ""I told you not to provoke her.""

Yasmine finally snapped out of her shock, her posture defensive as she confronted me. ""We were out of line first. I get it. But this is just insane!""

She raised her hand to strike me.

""Ah!"" I caught her wrist mid-swing and slapped her, hard, across the face.

The sound was sharp in the quiet room.

Mitchell spat out a mix of blood and frosting, a cold smile on his lips. ""You want a fight with me? Fine. But you can't touch her.""

He pulled the sobbing Yasmine close, her cheek still swollen from the slap. ""How about I trash this place for you? Will that make you feel better?""

She nodded and covered her cheek, tears in her eyes.

His bodyguards in black swarmed in. Clubs swung down, shattering glass and smashing the overhead light.

Cold wind and rain blew through the broken windows, soaking my face.

Mitchell gripped my chin, forcing my head up.

""You didn't start this. But she needs to see it end. Send me the bill for the damages. All of it.""

His eyes scanned me like I was a piece of discarded furniture.

I shoved his hand away, a sudden coughing fit seizing me. I frantically searched through the wreckage.

A small white prescription bottle rolled into view. My eyes locked onto it.

He was faster. He bent down and plucked it, reading the label.

""Six of these at once? Are you trying to kill yourself?""

He tossed the bottle into a rainwater puddle, put his arm around Yasmine, and walked away.

I knelt by the puddle, retrieved the bottle, and swallowed two more pills.

This medication was for anxiety and pain.

I started with half a pill. Now, eight couldn't stop my pain.

The pills were nearly gone. And so was I.

Chapter 4

Three years passed, and my mother died too.

My work was unstable. I'd taken many lives and become a target myself.

I'd spent all my savings on that bakery. Now, with it destroyed, I had nowhere left to go.

Maybe it was the pain seizing my limbs again, but I lacked the strength to move. I simply sat amidst the wreckage, letting the rain soak me.

Overnight, every major tabloid in New York led with ""Mitchell Harvey Returns to Wreak Havoc on His Ex.""

By sunrise, I was ready to leave.

Before going, I faced the shattered ruins and slowly bowed.

Mitchell appeared out of nowhere. He hauled me to my feet with one hand.

""It's just a bakery. Is it worth this?""

I slapped his hand away, steadied myself, and then struck him three sharp slaps across the face.

""My parents' memorial plaques were inside. They're gone now,"" I said, my voice flat. ""The bow was necessary.""

He worked his jaw, then smirked. ""Three slaps for your mother's memorial? Sounds like I got the better deal.""

I ignored him, staring at the devastation.

He stood behind me, deliberately twisting the knife.

""Paulette Sherman. I'm talking to you.""

I acted as if I hadn't heard and walked away.

He caught up in a few strides, blocking my path.

""Stop pretending you're fine! Look at yourself. You're ghostly pale. What are you trying to prove?""

""My old condition flared up. A little tired, that's all."" I looked up, offering a cold smile. ""Mitchell, did you really think you were important enough to affect me?""

But I knew the truth.

He'd come back specifically to make my life hell.

If I were still in good health, I wouldn't mind another round, maybe breaking a few of his bones in the process.

But now, just standing upright consumed all my energy.

In the hospital, the smell of disinfectant was nauseating.

Several doctors studied my scans, their expressions grim.

""How much of your last prescription is left?""

""It's gone.""

""Gone?!"" Steven Harriman's voice rose sharply. ""That was a three-month supply! It's only been a week!""

Steven had handled my case for years. His hesitation told me everything—my time was running out.

""Is... there anyone else in your family?"" he asked carefully.

""Have you forgotten?"" My tone was flat. ""My father's dead. My mother's gone. It's just me.""

He removed his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose. ""You were managing well for three years. What happened this past week...""

My phone screen lit up with a news alert—a prominent photo of Mitchell with Yasmine on his arm at some gala.

The person I thought I was over still hurt me the most.

Mitchell was the source of my deepest wounds, the one who knew how to hurt me most without leaving a mark.

""Your condition is extremely unstable. After stopping the medication, the first week, the first month, and the third month are all critical periods.

""Take this,"" he said, handing me a small bottle. His voice was heavy. ""Three pills when the pain is severe. No more than three.""

Before he finished, I'd twisted the cap off, shaken a handful into my palm, and dry-swallowed them.

The number didn't matter, as long as it dulled the bone-deep agony.

A week or three months made no difference to me.

After taking the pills, I crouched in the most inconspicuous corner of the hospital corridor, my back pressed against the cold wall.

I'd figured out that lowering my body temperature could ease the pain.

Cold sweat soaked through my thin clothes.

For ten minutes, I listened to the desperate prayers and weeping outside the operating room, where all hope hung on a single, fragile thread.

""Mommy, isn't that the lady who was in the bed next to us? Should we say goodbye?""

""Her illness... There's no cure. Let's not bother her. Such a tragic case. No family left, and such a severe sickness. She probably won't even have anyone to hold a funeral for her.""

The little girl looked up, confused. ""But surely someone in the world cares about her, right?""

I blinked hard, clearing my blurred vision, and focused on my phone screen.

A text came from Mitchell.

He'd been messaging since last night, persistently asking what compensation I wanted.

I thought about it. Maybe no one cared, but there was one person who could handle the funeral arrangements.

I dialed the number I knew by heart.

He answered instantly.

""Made up your mind?""

I took a sharp breath, swallowing the metallic taste in my mouth. ""If you insist on paying me back, Mitchell, you can be the one to bury me.""

Chapter 5

Silence stretched for seconds on the other end, followed by Mitchell's mocking laugh.

""Paulette, someone as vicious and stubborn as you usually lives forever. But if you do somehow die before me, rest assured, I'll give you the most lavish funeral New York has ever seen. I'll have the whole city light memorial candles for you!""

Satisfied with his promise, I hung up.

Outside the hospital, I saw the mother and daughter again.

The little girl was pounding her chest, her voice full of childish conviction. ""Who says nobody cares about her just because she has no family? Well, I do!""

""Enough, let's go. The bus is. Oh, the bus!"" Her mother pulled her away, rushing for the departing bus.

I walked to the parking garage and got into my black sedan.

Seeing they'd missed the bus, I impulsively rolled down the window. ""Get in. I'll give you a ride.""

I dropped them off downtown. They thanked me profusely and got out.

Just as I was about to pull away, I heard an irritating voice.

""Well, look at that. Paulette did a good deed. I suppose even you need to score some points.""

Mitchell's usual crowd was exiting a nearby club. Yasmine clung to his arm, her gaze sharp and venomous.

I didn't want a scene. I started raising the window to leave.

But Yasmine hurried over and pressed her hand against the glass.

A fake smile played on her lips, but her eyes were cold. ""I just found out about your history with Mitch. I hope we didn't... upset you yesterday?""

I had no patience for her act and tried to close the window again.

She gripped the window frame tightly. ""I have something for you. I really mean no harm.""

""I'm not interested. Get lost."" My patience was gone.

Yasmine suddenly let go. As I started the car, she pulled a small urn from her bag.

""I heard your mother's memorial plaque was destroyed in the shop. I gathered some ashes from the ruins this morning so you'd have something to remember her by.""

Her voice was sweet, but her actions were pure malice.

She reached through the window and poured the contents of the urn onto my passenger seat.

""Oh! You... you didn't catch it!"" she cried, stepping back with a perfect mask of innocence and sly satisfaction. ""You're not mad at me, are you?""

I watched her performance, and a sudden anger burned through the sickness inside me.

Good. She asked for this.

The group by the club entrance, clueless, was still praising Yasmine. ""Yas is so thoughtful, talking to that mess and even giving her a gift.""

Yasmine confidently turned and walked towards a shiny new Porsche parked ahead, triumphantly shaking her key fob.

I rolled down my window and called out, ""Yasmine! I have a gift for you, too!""

Yasmine turned, crossing her arms smugly. ""What are you giving me, Paulette?""

I tightened my seatbelt, my eyes locking on her. ""A one-way trip.""

Before the words faded, I slammed the accelerator.

""Bang!""

The front of my car smashed into the Porsche's rear.

Yasmine's car lurched forward uncontrollably.

I reversed, then slammed the gas again, hitting it a second time!

In the rearview mirror, I saw the drunken group jolt into sobriety.

""She's insane! She's actually insane!""

""I told you she was a lunatic! But you had to provoke her!""

""Relax, she won't really do anything. She's just blowing off steam, and then...""

He didn't finish.

True, I was blowing off steam.

But I wasn't done yet.

Yasmine stumbled out of the smoking car, her face pale, already slipping back into her fragile victim role.

""Mitch, wh... what did I do wrong?""

Mitchell had a cut on his forehead from flying glass, bleeding slightly. He moved urgently to shield Yasmine.

He understood my intent in a single glance.

""Paulette! Don't you dare!""

Ridiculous. There was nothing I dared not do.

I kept my eyes on Yasmine, my expression icy, and floored the accelerator.

The engine roared as the car shot straight toward her.

Chapter 6

I unbuckled my seatbelt, got out, and coldly observed Yasmine sprawled on the pavement a few yards away.

Her legs and arms were scraped and bleeding.

""You're lucky I let off the gas. Otherwise, you'd have more than scratches,"" I stated calmly.

She looked up, her eyes filled with naked hatred. ""Mitchell will make you pay for this!""

I picked up my handbag from the passenger seat, now soiled with the ashes, and used its corner to lift her chin. ""There. The real you is much more tolerable.""

I took the bag back, dusting it off with disgust. The group rushed over.

Mitchell hurried to help Yasmine up.

I took out my phone, called an ambulance, then tossed the handbag toward Yasmine.

""This bag's resale value is about 20,000 dollars. More than enough for her medical bills and the car repairs.""

""Paulette!"" Mitchell's voice was thick with suppressed rage.

I ignored him and walked away.

The taste of blood filled my mouth. I pressed my lips together and quickened my pace.

I nearly ran from the scene. Rounding a corner, sure I was out of sight, I braced myself against a wall and coughed, splattering dark blood onto the grimy brick.

A ringing filled my ears, my vision blurring. I forced myself onward, moving on instinct until I reached my temporary apartment.

If my body had held up, I might have turned back to cause Mitchell more trouble. I desperately wanted to see him furious and helpless against me.

I collapsed near the living room coffee table and poured a glass of water.

But after one sip, I coughed it all back up—water and blood.

The half-glass of water instantly turned crimson.

I lay on the floor, gasping for air. It felt like an invisible hand was twisting my insides. The pain was maddening, but I lacked even the strength to clench my teeth.

I had no idea how much time had passed before the buzzing of my phone and violent pounding on my door dragged me back to consciousness.

For a moment, I'd thought I wouldn't make it through the night.

The name flashing on the screen was Mitchell.

""Paulette! Open the door! I know you're in there!""

His voice came through, threatening and absolute, while the door thumped under his force.

""If you don't open it, I'll break it down!""

I knew he meant it. But I would never let him see me like this—broken and dying.

Summoning the last of my strength, I crawled into the bedroom, moved the wardrobe, and squeezed into the narrow hiding space behind it. The sound of the door being forced open echoed from outside, followed by hurried footsteps.

His texts flooded my screen, one after another.

""Hiding? You think that works?""

""Get out of here! We need to talk!""

""If anything happens to Yasmine, I'll make you pay with your life!""

I stared at my phone. A sudden drop of nosebleed hit the screen, forming a dark red stain. My consciousness faded.

I wanted to share a transparent breakdown of how I built my first consumer packaged product — a seasoning blend — from scratch. No selling and no links. Just a learn-from-my-journey kind of post. \*I had Chatgpt help me consolidate my thoughts and process into a digestible article.

**1. It Started With a Homemade Rub People** ***Actually*** **Loved**

I developed a seasoning rub over the years that family, friends, and coworkers constantly raved about. Everyone asked for more, asked me to bottle it, and joked that I should sell it.

So I decided to try.

What I didn’t realize at the time is this:

**The spices you buy at a grocery store are NOTHING like the premium, high-quality ingredients a real spice company has access to.**

Once I began working with higher-grade ingredients, the flavor profile changed drastically — for the better.

That kicked off a long series of iterations and refinements.

**2. Turning the Idea Into a Business**

I formed my LLC in **Delaware**, then realized I needed to register it again in **California** as a foreign entity. That required:

* a registered agent
* paying CA annual fees
* getting an EIN
* and opening a **Chase business account** using my LLC docs + agent address

Before filing anything, I checked:

* domain availability
* social handles
* brand name conflicts
* trademark potential

Then I secured the URL and all socials immediately.

**3. I Planned to Bottle Everything Myself… Until I Learned the Smarter Way**

My first plan was to hand-make the product:

* buy ingredients
* mix them myself
* buy empty bottles
* fill them at home
* label them
* pack and ship orders manually

Then I spoke to people in my network who had built real CPG brands and they told me:

**“Do NOT manufacture at home. Find a co-packer.”**

A co-packer will:

* source premium ingredients
* mix everything professionally
* bottle and seal
* apply labels
* meet food safety standards
* and ship finished cartons directly to Amazon

This eliminated the need for:

* inventory at my house
* storage units
* a garage operation
* manual production
* the overhead of creating a home “facility”

It made my business instantly scalable.

**4. Choosing a Co-Packer**

I eventually partnered with *The Spice Guy* in Denver — legitimate, experienced, and extremely helpful.

We went through multiple rounds of tweaking the recipe:

* balancing the coffee intensity
* adjusting sweetness
* refining citrus brightness
* improving the savory foundation
* keeping salt levels in check
* dialing in the heat

Each sample got closer until one finally hit the perfect balance.

**5. Why I Didn’t Use a 3PL**

I interviewed multiple 3PL fulfillment centers.  
Every one of them required:

* high minimum monthly volume
* long-term contracts
* expensive pallet storage
* fulfillment fees that didn’t make sense for a small launch

Takeaway:  
**3PLs are amazing once you’re doing real volume — but not worth it for launch.**

Amazon FBA + co-packer direct shipping was the far smarter route.

**6. Branding, Labeling & FDA Compliance**

This part took way longer than expected.

I worked with a designer through dozens of revisions while learning FDA rules for:

* ingredient order
* net weight size & placement
* allergens
* nutrition panel formatting
* min font sizes
* layout spacing
* label dimensions

Photography and visual content also took a huge amount of time:

* white-background images for Amazon
* lifestyle shots
* BBQ shots
* ingredient shots
* A+ content modules (very specific pixel sizes)
* mockups
* banner graphics

The design work alone felt like its own startup.

**7. Amazon FBA Setup**

Amazon looks simple from the outside, but onboarding was detailed and strict.

Things I had to do:

* business verification
* identity verification
* buy GTIN/UPC barcodes
* create the listing
* upload compliant images
* format bullet points
* build A+ content
* set up shipping plans
* carton labeling
* compliance forms

I kept costs low by:

* using GoDaddy’s free hosting
* pointing my domain to my Amazon storefront to avoid monthly Shopify fees

I also built a simple “Account Xcel” spreadsheet that tracks everything — expenses, margins, inventory, etc.

A huge turning point was when I finally connected with a **dedicated Amazon rep**, who:

* helped verify my brand
* linked the product to my business
* guided me on Brand Registry steps

Without that rep, this would’ve taken significantly longer.

**8. Trademarking the Logo (and almost getting scammed)**

To qualify for Amazon Brand Registry, I filed a trademark for my logo.

In the middle of this, someone emailed me pretending to be a “USPTO review officer” trying to set up a “Trademark evaluation meeting.”

It looked legit — but it was a scam.

Lesson: **Always verify through the actual USPTO portal.**

**9. Production & Logistics**

My co-packer produced the first **500-unit run**, labeled everything professionally, and shipped the cartons directly to Amazon FBA.

The units are currently:

* being received
* scanned
* sorted
* distributed across Amazon’s warehouse network

The listing will go live once Amazon finishes processing.

Surreal moment.

**10. Why I’m Launching** ***First*** **on Amazon**

Long-term, I’ll build my own website (much higher margins).  
But starting on Amazon does three critical things:

**✔️ Builds trust**

**✔️ Builds reviews**

**✔️ Builds brand identity**

Launching a standalone website with **zero social proof** is significantly harder and more expensive.

Once Amazon seeds the trust, going DTC becomes much more viable.

**11. Total Cost: \~$5,000**

All-in so far:

* Delaware LLC
* CA foreign registration
* Registered agent
* Trademark filing
* First production run
* Labels & design
* Packaging tests
* Photography & content
* GTIN barcodes
* Amazon fees
* Misc admin

I intentionally kept the startup extremely lean.

**12. Launch Prep**

Since products aren’t live yet, I’m currently:

* planning a lean launch strategy
* preparing photos and videos
* finalizing A+ content
* optimizing pricing and margins
* keeping overhead as close to zero as possible 

**13. Lessons I Wish I Knew**

**1. Don’t bottle at home — use a co-packer.**

It saves time, keeps you legal, and scales immediately.

**2. Amazon is a trust engine.**

Use it first before building your own site.

**3. Everything takes longer than you think.**

There were countless delays and revisions.

**4. You can absolutely launch a real CPG product for \~$5K.**

**5. Most of the job is logistics and compliance — not creativity.**

**14. Where Things Stand**

No revenue yet. Not live yet.  
My product is literally in Amazon’s distribution network waiting to activate.

But I’ve gone from:

**Homemade rub → LLC → Delaware + CA → co-packer → branding → trademark → Amazon FBA → inventory shipped**

…to being days or weeks from reality.

Happy to answer questions for anyone thinking about starting something similar.

They are a league above American women.

Style, elegance, femininity, kindness. They are interesting and can engage you in stimulating conversations. They are not judgemental about your weirdness or playing highschool level popularity games. You can actually open up to them about your deeper feelings. They judge less and laugh more. They see your effort and strive to match it. They are rarely entitled. They don't even need to be objectively ""hot"", they're seductive in their personalities anyway. Not to say I don't like pretty women, but you don't know how much more attractive a woman can be outside her looks until you meet some quality girls.

I've had girls demand to treat me for a second date. I've had them take my tea or coffee from me, ask how much sugar I wanted, and stir it in and pass it back. They touch you more, nonsexually. They compliment you. Women I barely know. Unheard of in my dates with American women. Dating isn't a cold wasteland.

Now is this all foriegn women? Of course not. But it's only ever been foriegn women to have these qualities in my experience.

Now, I also don't go to dating hotspots or travel for dating, so I never find myself in a dating ecosystem like I imagine exist in some of these passport bro hotspots like Medellin. I imagine there's a lot of strategy and ""gaming"" involved in that scene, which to me sounds like it devolves somewhat into the same problems that plague western dating. Just my two cents.

But overall, foreign women are in a class above American women in their personalities and disposition alone. If you're any sort of lover kinda guy, foriegn women are where it's at. You'd be surprised how easily you fall for women who genuinely appreciate and respect the opposite gender and treat you like a person.",3,1766030760.0,Passport_Bros,1,1.0,False

- Strong religious guilt and internalized homophobia
- After kissing or sex, he would pray and deny his feelings
- The other MC found this absurd and would sexually provoke him on purpose
- There was action, fights, escaping, and a kidnapping (the priest)
- One MC belonged to a powerful mafia family
- Possibly one character had a prosthetic limb (not 100% sure)
- One MC had past trauma: sexual abuse as a teen, possibly in a religious orphanage
- They eventually arrive in Italy
- Cover (from memory): brown/orange/coffee tones, roses and crucifixes
- It had smut, but it was story-driven, not pure smut

So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'.

I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

That’s important to understand, because if I had known then what I know now, I would have started paying attention much earlier. I would have counted every blink. Measured every lapse. I would have treated sleep like a loaded rifle.

But I didn’t.

I was normal.

Or at least, I thought I was.


The first thing I noticed was the mug with a middle finger decorated on it.

I know, it sounds stupid when I say it like that. A coffee mug is not a portent. It’s not a warning sign. It’s a ceramic cylinder with a chipped rim that I bought from a thrift store because it was cheap and heavy and made the coffee feel more real in my hands.

It was blue. Faded. The handle had a hairline crack running down its base.

I know this because I had stared at that crack every morning for years on end.

That morning, the crack on the base of the mug, suddenly vanished.

I was standing in my kitchen, barefoot on cold tile, coffee steaming up into my face, staring at a mug that was unmistakably mine—same weight, same color, same faint ring of old coffee stain inside—but wrong in a way I couldn’t immediately articulate.

I turned it slowly in my hand.

No crack.

I remember feeling annoyed more than afraid. Annoyed at myself. I assumed I had misremembered. Memory does that. You read enough about false recall and suddenly everything feels negotiable.

I laughed, actually. A short breath through my nose.

“Get more sleep,” I told myself out loud.

I drank the coffee. Burned my tongue slightly. Winced. Real sensations have a way of grounding you.

That should have been the end of it.

The second thing was the note.

I found it folded on my desk when I got home from work that evening. I live alone. My apartment is small—one bedroom, one bathroom, thin walls, the kind of place where you hear your neighbors sneeze and flush and argue about cash.

I lock my door. Always have.

The note was written on one of my own sticky pads. Yellow. Slightly curled at the corners. My pen. Black ink.

My handwriting.

It said:

“Stop closing your eyes for so long.”

That was it. No punctuation. No signature.

I stood there staring at it, the way you stare at a word you’ve repeated too many times until it loses meaning. Closing. Eyes. So long.

I didn’t remember writing it.

That bothered me more than the message itself.

People forget writing notes sometimes. You jot things down distractedly. Autopilot. Especially if you’re stressed. I’d been working longer hours. Sleeping badly. Doomscrolling until my eyes burned from the bright light.

Still, something about the phrasing felt…personal. Specific. Like it wasn’t meant to remind me of something obvious, but something I wasn’t supposed to notice.

I picked it up and turned it over.

Blank.

I checked the trash. No torn notes. No drafts. No explanation.

That night, I dreamed I was awake.

I know that sounds paradoxical, but that’s the only way I can describe it. In the dream, I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to my own breathing. Everything was exactly the same as when I’m conscious—the hum of the fridge, the distant traffic, the subtle flicker of streetlight through the blinds, completely normal.

In the dream, I was terrified to blink.

My eyes burned. My vision swam. I tried to keep them open, wider and wider, forcing them past comfort, past pain.

Because I knew—dream-me knew—that if I closed them, something would move.

I woke up with my heart racing and my face wet with tears I didn’t remember crying.

Things escalated quietly after that.

Not dramatically. No slamming doors or shadows in corners. Just…inconsistencies. Little edits to reality that felt like typos.

My couch pillows were rearranged when I got home. My phone battery was lower than it should have been. A browser tab was open that I didn’t remember clicking—an article about microsleeps and dissociative fugue states.

I told myself a story to keep myself calm.

You’re tired.
You’re stressed.
Everyone zones out.
Your normal.

The problem with zoning out is that you don’t know when it happens.

That realization hit me one afternoon at work while I was staring at my computer screen, cursor blinking in an empty document. I couldn’t remember how long I’d been sitting there. My eyes felt dry. My neck ached.

My coworker leaned over the divider and said, “You okay? You just…stopped.”

“Stopped what?”

“Talking.”

I frowned. “I wasn’t talking.”

“Yes, you were,” she said, smiling uncertainly. “You were mid-sentence and then you just went quiet. Eyes open. Didn’t blink.”

A chill ran through me that had nothing to do with the air conditioning.

“How long?”

She shrugged. “A few seconds? It was weird. I thought you were messing with me.”

I laughed it off. What else could I do?

But the idea lodged itself in my head like a splinter.

What happens when I stop perceiving?

I started paying attention after that.

Not obsessively. Not yet. Just…noticing.

I noticed that sometimes I would look at the clock and feel like time had skipped, the way a scratched DVD jumps ahead a few frames. I noticed that my reflection sometimes felt delayed, like it was thinking about copying me before it did. And noticeably, my eyes in the mirror were bloodshot.

I noticed how often people blinked.

How often I blinked.

It’s impossible to stop entirely. Your body won’t let you. I tried once, in the bathroom mirror, forcing my eyes open until tears streamed down my face and my vision fragmented into starbursts.

I lasted maybe forty seconds before my eyelids slammed shut on their own.

In that moment of darkness—less than a second—I felt something like pressure. Like a presence stepping closer.

When my eyes opened again, my heart was pounding and my reflection was already grinning.

I wasn’t.

I stumbled back and laughed shakily, telling myself I was officially losing it.

That night, I set up my phone on my dresser and hit record before going to bed.

I didn’t tell myself why. I just knew I needed to see what happened when I wasn’t looking.

The first recording showed nothing.

Eight hours of darkness. Occasional shifting. Me turning over, mumbling, scratching my nose. Boring. Human.

I almost felt relieved.

Then I scrubbed through it again.

At 3:17 a.m., I sat up.

Not groggy. Not slow. I sat up smoothly, spine straight, eyes open.

I stared directly into the camera.

I didn’t blink.

I didn’t move.

I didn’t breathe.

I sat there like that for three minutes and forty-two seconds. My eyes bloodshot, just like in the mirror. 

Then I lay back down.

I don’t remember any of it.

I watched that section over and over, my breath shallow, my hands numb. The face staring back at me was mine—same mole under the left eye, same uneven eyebrows—but the expression was wrong.

Too still.

Too aware.

Like it knew it was being watched.

At the end of the video, just before I turned the camera off in the morning, I leaned forward and spoke.

I don’t remember doing that either.

On the screen, my voice was calm. Steady. Almost kind.

I said:

“Recording doesn’t help. You blink when you watch it.”

I didn’t sleep after that.

I sat on the edge of my bed with the lights on, eyes burning, replaying the footage until dawn. Every time I blinked, my stomach dropped.

Because now I knew something I couldn’t unknow.

There are moments when I am not in control.
And something else is.

Morning came eventually. Gray and dull and ordinary.

I went to work. I answered emails. I smiled at jokes. Life continued with cruel indifference.

But underneath it all was a growing certainty that made it hard to breathe:

Something was waiting for me to stop looking.

And I did, stopped looking. 

I flew out of consciousness, only saw darkness.

What felt like hours later, I finally woke up. But I wasn’t at my desk, sitting at my chair.

But something else was. Me. And when I looked around me, I only saw a void under my feet. Void around me. Like a box with no light.

My breathing grew faster, my heart beating like a war drum. Then, I ran towards myself. But an invisible wall stopped me. 

I tried to claw my way out, but it wouldn’t budge. 

I tried to do it for minutes before my body turned its head towards me.

I was grinning, impossibly wide for a normal human, like a Cheshire Cat.

I grabbed my phone from my back pocket, and for some reason, opened the photo app. As I looked at myself through the phone, my eyes were bloodshot, like my reflection in the mirror. 

I also had the same grin. I looked outside the invisible wall and looked around, I was in a mirror.",1,1766029511.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,0.99,False
1ppgxlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BehaviorAnalysis/comments/1ppgxlz/nondeprivation_based_eos/,Non-Deprivation Based EOs,"Hello everyone. I was looking back at some readings on establishing operations and have a question. Most of the examples I have seen describe conditions of deprivation - such as conditions that elicit thirst also establishing water as a reinforcer. Some also describe how aversive stimulation can establish contingencies of escape or avoidance.

My question is, can establishing operations develop through conditions of association that are not related to increasing the aversive nature of the context?

For example, I enjoy coffee. I will work for the opportunity to consume coffee. 

But I like coffee more when I'm sitting on the deck during a fall afternoon. During a typical afternoon, I won't make a cup of coffee. But if the leaves are changing, and I'm sitting outside taking it all in, it's more likely I will put in the work to brew a mug. 

Relative to most afternoons, at this point in my life, fall afternoons on the deck make coffee more reinforcing for me. Would it be accurate to describe being on the deck in the fall as functioning as an EO for coffee? Or is this mis-applying the construct? What is a better way to describe this phenomena behaviorally?

**As a guy, I understand that just because a girl is nice, it doesn’t necessarily mean she’s interested. But hear me out.**

I met a girl at a volunteer place. I’m a volunteer, and she works part-time as a barista at the coffee shop there. I see her every weekend. We’re 7 years apart—I just turned 27 and she’s 20. Is that weird? I figured since we’re both in our 20s, it shouldn’t be.

Lately, I’ve really been enjoying our conversations. One thing that stands out is how engaging she is. Since there aren’t many customers, I’ll often stand at the counter and we’ll talk for 3–5 minutes, sometimes even 10. We talk about our week, our day, things going on in our lives, holiday plans, etc. She asks questions that keep the conversation going, and when things start to die down, she’ll bring up a random topic to continue it. I do the same, of course. You're probably thinking, she wants tips... Bare in mind that she works at a non-profit organization and she's also not allowed to receive tips.

She also remembers things we talked about before and follows up on them the next time I see her. For example:

* I mentioned doing a strict water fast, and the next week she asked how it was going. That led to her opening up about her mom’s breast cancer diagnosis and how she went vegan to support her.
* I told her about my AI prompt engineering certification, and she asked the following week how it was going.
* She asks if I went to a car show when I come in on Saturdays (I go pretty often).
* When she sees me, she’ll ask if I just got in or if I’ve been there a while.

She also notices my schedule. One time I came in early and she said, “Are you here earlier today?” Another time, after I’d missed a few Sundays, she asked, “You come in on Sundays??”

After Thanksgiving, she asked if I went Black Friday shopping, then excitedly told me—without me asking—that she bought stuff at Sephora because it was 50% off. I thought that was kinda cute, lol.

**Another thing that stood out:** a few weeks ago, I mentioned my sister is visiting from Singapore for Christmas and wants to go to San Francisco. She excitedly said, “I’m from the Bay Area!” She asked if I knew the small city she’s from and mentioned she’d be back in NorCal for Christmas and said “Maybe I’ll see you.”

A couple months ago, she asked me to remind her which church I go to and whether I’m part of any groups (I’m not). She said she knows someone who might go to the same church and be in a group. Does that mean she was thinking about me?

Writing all this out makes me feel like our conversations might be surface-level, but to be fair, she’s at work when we talk. Still, the way she keeps the conversation going is something I’ve never really experienced before.

I’ll admit I’m pretty blind when it comes to signs from girls—my friends tell me that all the time. I’d really love to hear your thoughts from a third-person POV, especially from women.

If you think these are all great signs, how should i proceed? Since I love volunteering there, just in case I face rejection and risk ending up in an awkward situation, what is the best and most casual way to ask her out?

1ppgtdo,https://i.redd.it/gay8py09vv7g1.png,Funghi medicinali micoterapia con ricette,"Iniziare un'integrazione con i funghi medicinali (micoterapia) è un ottimo modo per sostenere il benessere psicofisico, ma è importante farlo con un approccio graduale e mirato.
Ecco alcuni consigli pratici su come impostare la tua ""routine"" con i prodotti French Mush:
1. Scegliere il momento della giornata
I funghi hanno effetti diversi sul corpo, quindi il ""timing"" è fondamentale:
 * Al mattino (Cordyceps): Essendo focalizzato su energia e performance, il Cordyceps è ideale appena svegli o circa 30 minuti prima di un allenamento/attività intensa. Aiuta l'ossigenazione cellulare e non dà il ""crollo"" tipico della caffeina.
 * Durante il giorno (Complesso 5 Funghi): Questo mix è bilanciato. Puoi assumerlo a metà mattina o pranzo per mantenere alte le difese e la lucidità mentale.
 * La sera (Evitare il Cordyceps): Se nel mix del ""Complexe 5"" la dose di Reishi fosse prevalente, andrebbe bene anche la sera, ma poiché contiene anche Cordyceps, è preferibile assumerlo entro il primo pomeriggio per non interferire con il sonno.
2. Modalità di assunzione
Essendo in polvere (30g per barattolo), hai diverse opzioni:
 * Bevande calde: Sciogli la dose (solitamente un cucchiaino raso o il dosatore incluso) in caffè, tè o nel ""fungo-caffè"".
 * Frullati o Yogurt: È il modo più semplice per mascherare il sapore terroso tipico dei funghi.
 * Acqua tiepida: Per un assorbimento rapido, anche se il gusto è molto naturale e particolare.
3. Durata del ciclo
La micoterapia non è istantanea come un farmaco; lavora per accumulo.
 * Costanza: I primi benefici si avvertono dopo 2-3 settimane.
 * Ciclo consigliato: Si consiglia solitamente un ciclo di 2 o 3 mesi, seguito da una pausa di 1-2 settimane per permettere ai recettori del corpo di resettarsi.
Esempio di Routine Quotidiana
 * Colazione: 1 dose di Cordyceps nel caffè o porridge (per la carica fisica).
 * Pranzo: 1 dose di Complexe 5 Champignons in un bicchiere d'acqua o succo (per il supporto immunitario e cognitivo).
Alcuni consigli importanti:
 * Idratazione: I funghi medicinali aiutano a disintossicare il corpo; bevi molta acqua durante il giorno.
 * Vitamina C: Assumere i funghi insieme a una fonte di Vitamina C (come una spremuta d'arancia) ne migliora l'assorbimento dei beta-glucani.
Qual è il tuo obiettivo principale? (Ad esempio: avere più energia nello sport, migliorare la memoria nello studio o rinforzare le difese immunitarie?) Posso aiutarti a rifinire meglio il dosaggio.
Se vuoi creare un'integrazione personalizzata ispirata a quella di French Mush, puoi agire in due modi: acquistando i funghi singoli per modulare le dosi o creando un ""blend"" unico.
Ecco una guida su come formulare un integratore simile in termini di efficacia e qualità.
1. La Formula ""Master"" (Ispirata al Complexe 5)
Per replicare l'efficacia del mix che hai visto, dovresti combinare questi estratti in polvere. Una dose giornaliera standard è di circa 1000-1500 mg totali. Ecco le proporzioni ideali per un effetto bilanciato:
 * Lion's Mane (25%): Per la neuroplasticità e la memoria.
 * Cordyceps (25%): Per l'energia ATP e la resistenza.
 * Reishi (20%): Per la gestione dello stress e del cortisolo.
 * Chaga (15%): Per l'apporto di antiossidanti.
 * Shiitake (15%): Per il supporto al sistema immunitario.
2. Requisiti di Qualità (Cosa cercare)
Per far sì che il tuo integratore ""fai-da-te"" funzioni come quello francese, quando acquisti le materie prime assicurati che abbiano queste diciture:
 * Estratto Titolato: Non comprare semplice ""fungo polverizzato"". Cerca estratti che specifichino la percentuale di Beta-Glucani (almeno >15%) o Polisaccaridi (almeno >30%).
 * Corpo Fruttifero (Fruiting Body): Molti integratori economici usano il ""micelio su grano"", che è meno potente. Assicurati che l'estratto derivi dal corpo fruttifero del fungo.
 * Doppia Estrazione: Fondamentale per funghi come il Reishi e il Chaga, per estrarre sia i composti idrosolubili che quelli liposolubili (triterpeni).
3. Ricetta pratica per il tuo ""Fungo Coffee"" o Smoothie
Se compri i sacchetti di estratti singoli, ecco come preparare la tua dose quotidiana simile a quella di French Mush:
Il ""Focus & Power"" Mix
 * 1/2 cucchiaino di estratto di Cordyceps (Energia)
 * 1/2 cucchiaino di estratto di Lion's Mane (Focus)
 * Punta di un cucchiaino di polvere di Cacao amaro (migliora il gusto e la circolazione)
 * Opzionale: Un pizzico di cannella o pepe nero (per l'assorbimento)
> Istruzioni: Mescola in 200ml di acqua calda, latte vegetale o nel tuo caffè mattutino.
> 
4. Dove trovare le materie prime
Esistono diversi fornitori europei che vendono estratti di alta qualità in polvere (sfusi), che ti permettono di risparmiare rispetto ai barattoli pre-miscelati:
 * Hifas da Terra (Spagnola, altissima qualità farmaceutica).
 * Sunday Natural (Tedesca, ottimi estratti puri e certificati).
 * Koro (Spesso hanno formati grandi di polveri di funghi bio).
Un'ultima raccomandazione
Se decidi di creare il tuo mix, ti consiglio di iniziare con un fungo alla volta (es. solo Cordyceps per una settimana) per vedere come reagisce il tuo corpo, e poi aggiungere gli altri.
Vuoi che ti aiuti a calcolare le grammature precise per creare un barattolo da 100g di mix fatto in casa?
Certamente! Se hai a disposizione le polveri di funghi (o vuoi miscelare i prodotti di French Mush), ecco 4 ricette specifiche per diversi obiettivi della giornata.
I funghi medicinali hanno un sapore che vira verso l'umami (terroso, simile al cacao amaro o al brodo), quindi si prestano bene sia a preparazioni dolci che salate.
1. Il ""Caffè Potenziato"" (Focus e Studio/Lavoro)
Questa ricetta sostituisce il normale caffè per evitare il nervosismo, sfruttando l'azione del Lion's Mane (Criniera di Leone).
 * Base: 1 tazza di caffè (moka o americano) o caffè d’orzo.
 * Funghi: 1/2 cucchiaino di Lion's Mane o Complesso 5 Funghi.
 * Boost: 1 cucchiaino di olio di cocco o burro ghee (i grassi aiutano l'assorbimento dei principi attivi).
 * Aroma: Un pizzico di cannella.
 * Preparazione: Frulla tutto per 10 secondi per creare una schiuma densa e cremosa (tipo cappuccino).
2. Lo ""Smoothie Pre-Workout"" (Energia e Resistenza)
Ideale se usi il Cordyceps, che aiuta a migliorare l'uso dell'ossigeno durante lo sforzo fisico.
 * Base: 250ml di latte di mandorla o acqua di cocco.
 * Funghi: 1 cucchiaino raso di Cordyceps.
 * Frutta: 1 banana matura (per il potassio) e una manciata di frutti di bosco (antiossidanti).
 * Extra: 1 cucchiaio di burro di arachidi o mandorle.
 * Preparazione: Frulla tutto freddo. Il sapore del Cordyceps si sposa perfettamente con il burro di frutta secca.
3. La ""Cioccolata del Relax"" (Anti-Stress e Sonno)
Ottima per il tardo pomeriggio o la sera, usando il Reishi (spesso presente nei mix come il ""5 Champignons"") che aiuta a calmare il sistema nervoso.
 * Base: 200ml di latte d'avena o latte intero caldi.
 * Funghi: 1/2 cucchiaino di Complesso 5 Funghi (o Reishi puro).
 * Gusto: 1 cucchiaio di cacao amaro in polvere e un po' di miele o sciroppo d'acero.
 * Tocco finale: Un pizzico di sale marino (esalta il cioccolato) e vaniglia.
 * Preparazione: Mescola bene con un frustino mentre scaldi il latte sul fuoco (senza farlo bollire).
4. Il ""Brodo dell'Immunità"" (Salato e Ricostituente)
Se non ami i sapori dolci, i funghi medicinali sono perfetti nelle zuppe, poiché ne esaltano il sapore sapido.
 * Base: Una tazza di brodo vegetale o di osso (bone broth) caldo.
 * Funghi: 1 cucchiaino di Complesso 5 Funghi (che contiene Chaga e Shiitake, ottimi per il sistema immunitario).
 * Condimento: Un cucchiaino di miso, zenzero fresco grattugiato e un filo di olio di sesamo.
 * Preparazione: Sciogli la polvere di funghi e il miso nel brodo caldo (non bollente per non rovinare il miso) e bevi come una zuppa rinvigorente.
💡 Consiglio Pro: La ""Sinergia C""
Indipendentemente dalla ricetta che scegli, prova ad aggiungere sempre un po' di Vitamina C (limone, arancia o camu-camu). La ricerca suggerisce che la Vitamina C aiuti a rompere le lunghe catene di polisaccaridi dei funghi, rendendo i beta-glucani più facili da assorbire per l'intestino.

That one minute changed the tone of my mornings more than I expected. I felt less anxious and less reactive, 

It made me realize mindfulness doesn’t always need silence or cushions. It can live inside small daily rituals.

The interview lasted about an hour and a half but honestly it felt more like a casual conversation than an actual interview. There were no trick questions. The officer mostly verified basic information like our full names, birthdays, and phone numbers. She noticed that our anniversary had just passed and asked how we celebrated.

We talked about our future travel plans, about work, everyday life, and even about coffee and breakfast spots. At one moment I was the one that started asking her questions LOL, about her job, how she likes it, and told her that I find it very interesting because she gets to meet new people all the time and hear their different stories and she said she ONLY enjoys working on cases like ours because they are happy and simple stories, which was really nice to hear.

She told us she couldn’t approve the case on the spot because she had just received it shortly before the interview. Later that same day my I-130 was approved. Today I got the best news ever and my I-485 has also been approved. I am so happy and relieved. Everything went smoothly and now it is finally official. Please feel free to ask me any questions I am here to answer with details and I wish you luck to each and every one of you.",2,1766028853.0,USCIS,3,1.0,False

It’s deep and it hurts. It’s exhausting. Like a weight pressing down on me that I’m desperate to move, but can’t. And yet, there I am, sitting beside my husband after our baby has gone to sleep.

My heart aches to feel something. To feel seen. I don’t want to put this all on him. It isn’t his job to fix me. And yet, I feel as though I’m looking at him from behind a wall, more disconnected from him than I ever have been. I’m scared to tell him how I really feel.

Then there’s my baby. When I look at her, I feel a love I never knew my heart was capable of holding. And still, I feel lonely. She is just a baby after all, it is not her fault that I feel this way, and I could never expect her to fill this emptiness.

When I think about the days ahead, I feel a deep pit form in my stomach. The same routine. The same day, over and over. I wish someone would reach out. An adult, anyone, just to say, “hey, want to grab a coffee?” It’s hard to admit how much that would mean. How it would feel like someone throwing me a life jacket so I could breathe for a moment.

What feels strangest is how much I’ve changed. A year ago, I was happy to be alone. I was the person who felt relieved when plans were cancelled. Now, I feel desperate for connection. I feel like I’m crying out for help, but no one can hear me.

They talk about winter blues, but for me it feels heavier on warm, sunny days. The sun used to make me happy. Now it feels like a reminder that everyone else is out living their lives, laughing with friends, while I’m at home doing the same thing again.",2,1766028583.0,Mommit,2,1.0,False

I feel stabs piercing right through my chest, eyes blurring with tears, mouth dry unable to gasp air.

Eve

""Eve, honey, can you please grab some chocolate bars for me on your way home?"" mom says over the phone after I barely had the chance to say 'hey, Mamma, I'm on my way.'

The classes today have exhausted me to my bones. I have been in school for the past ten hours, had a court staged in the class for one of the famous murder cases that have shaken NY ten years ago and which is still unsolved.

And guess what? I've smelled uncle Mike around that case.

I tried as much as I could to keep myself away from the action, stayed in the back, and listened until the professor called me in front, and I had to involve.

Don't judge me, I'm not the one to be happy about the awful murder of someone but that guy, burned to his teeth, was some human trafficker who kidnapped girls to sell in Europe, most probably intercourse slaves.

And it wasn't like I didn't know Enzo had exclusivist clubs of the kind in Italy, but hey, women were free to choose if they wanted that sort of life.

So, by the end of the day the victim was actually the murderer, not of himself (God, I love the play of words) but of some victims found dead and to which he was linked, and I dragged everybody's concentration to the point of nobody believing him to be a victim anymore.

Well, finally the professor had stated his conclusion in the end: case unsolved.

The victim was brought to the state of being accused post-mortem and I was satisfied because cases like this had been my motivation to study here.

Having not enough proves to lead to the murderer of the human trafficker, by the end of the class the case was officially closed (at least in our play).

The class is ended so I'm now rushing towards Jason's car who is waiting for me outside to drop me at mom and dad's, like every day since dad is back.

""Hey, Jas,"" I tell him once I get in the car. ""We need to buy mom chocolate bars on our way home, or she will have my head,"" I tell him while buckling up.

""Hey, to you, too. How was your day?"" he asks, leaning over for a quick hug.

In the past two weeks, we've grown to be some sort of friends. He's my guard, again, watching over my safety. I'm a brat, like usual, giving him a hard time. Like really hard time.

I've developed a habit of sending him in the middle of the night to buy me different things I'm craving like inferno for, the strangest staff.

""I want ravioli.""

""I want tomato pasta.""

""I am dying for some strawberries,"" I would tell him, sitting next to him on the living room sofa where he's usually sleeping, pocking him between his ribs to wake up.

""Are you sure the chocolate bars are for Miss Becca? I mean, you better keep some for yourself. I really don't want you to wake me up in the middle of the night and send me to buy you some,"" he tells me, eyes on the road, driving, trying to look serious but from the curled up the corner of his lips, I can tell he'll not mind at all.

""Oh, stop complaining,"" I scold him, slapping him lightly on his arms.

He shifts his eyes to me, grabbing the top of my nose between two fingers of his right hand, while I push his hand away and we both laugh heartily.

""You should seriously check on that craving thing, Eve. A pregnancy test or something,"" he says becoming serious and tightening the grip of his hand on the wheel.

""There is nothing like that, Jas. I'm just working a lot on my finals, that's all,"" I try to sound relaxed and unfazed. Little he knows I'm very aware of the reason for my cravings.

""Eve, if there is a baby you need care, you need regular doctor check-ups,"" he continues on the same serious note, dismissing my denial.

I know there is a truth in his words, I know there are high chances I'm pregnant, but I dint want to check on anything until Enzo is back.

I want us to be together when I'll have the test, and find the result together, and be both happy with that result.

And I want him to take me to the doctor and have the ultrasound while we both search for that little bean on the screen, acknowledging nothing but our hearts racing at the sight of the new life growing in me, a life that we've both created.

Jason parks the car in front of the candy shop that my mom loves so much.

She's been their regular customer for years and if my mom craves lava cake at two and night, they will do it at the two o'clock in the night.

""Wait here,"" Jas says while parking the car and getting down to enter the shop and be done with the errant given by mom.

I wait for him to walk further away and bury my face in my palms, trying to push back the tears threatening to roll out of my eyes.

There are three weeks since dad, grandpa Marce, and uncle Mike have returned from Italy.

Meanwhile, Enzo has been brought back from his induced coma, and he's getting better, they've said.

He has never called me once though. They've told me it's not safe for me yet. Things need to sink for a while, although the threat has been eliminated.

So, I didn't break, like Jason said, during the day. Women in my family don't break. They wait, quietly and patiently.

At night it's a totally different story, wrapping myself in sadness and crying my sorrow in silence.

And even though I'm running out of patience, I'm doing just the opposite. I'm waiting, looking all cheerful and happy during the day but breaking down in cries during the night.

Most of the time I see the shadow of Jason's legs walking up and down in front of the door of my room, waiting for me to stop crying, just to get back to his sofa in the living room once I'm done sobbing.

But one night he couldn't hold back and tried to make me stop, walking in my bedroom and wrapping me in his arms.

He said he couldn't bear my crying anymore, that I would crash if I continued like this, and he threatened to tell dad.

'Get off!' I told him. I knew he wouldn't tell on me.

I spread a wide smile on my face when he gets back in the car with two very similar packages.

""Why two?"" I ask.

He looks at me with a smirk and raises an eyebrow.

""I'm not waking up tonight, Eve. I told you!"" he says, threatening me in a joke.

I give him a quick smooch on his cheek and shove my hand in one package he has brought, grabbing a chocolate bar and pushing it all in my mouth.

""Hmm,"" I hum, closing my eyes and letting all senses feel the chocolate aroma to its last drop. ""I swear these are brought directly from heaven,"" I mumble, mouth filled with soft milk chocolate.

Jason laughs and shakes his head.

""You're too cute,"" he says.

""Nope. I'm not cute. I'm a brat, remember?"" I say, smiling, repeating his usual words.

He puts the car in motion again, taking the road to the mansion, and soon Jason drives the car through the mansion's gates.

""Come on, we're here,"" he says, parking the car in front of the mansion and lightly shaking my shoulder to wake me up from the short nap I've had on the way here.

I frown when my eyes land on a car that I haven't seen here before, parked behind.

I grab the chocolates and get down when Jason opens the door for me and grabs my hand lightly, while my eyes still wander on the new car.

He walks before me towards the entrance and opens the door for me. Jesus, I'm a glass fairy, I chuckle.

""Mamma?"" I call while dropping the packages and my purse on the living room sofa.

There is nobody around. I take a peek in the kitchen then shift my eyes to the patio where I know mom usually has her coffee.

Seems there is someone outside and I shift towards the sliding doors, stopping by the living room to fetch my mom's precious chocolates and exit the kitchen.

As I walk closer, my breath races. I see mom sitting on the outside sofa, facing her back to the sliding doors, talking with that someone that has had my heart in an iron grip for the past months, beating only for the day when I'll see him again.

My look is magnetized to him, piercing my eyes to the back of his neck, rushing my steps.

""What do you think she'll do when she finds out about us?"" my mom says, and I stop right there.

She holds Enzo's hand clasped between hers, head just a little tilted towards him while Enzo looks straight ahead.

""She'll have to understand. Lucas did. I'm not giving up on her, Becks. Not like I did with you,"" he says, and I feel stabs piercing right through my chest, eyes blurring with tears, mouth dry unable to gasp air.

""She's young, Enzo. She might not,"" mom replies.

""Find out what?!"" I shout and two pairs of eyes snap towards me, gauged from their orbits, mouths gaped, staring back at me.

""Sweetheart..."" my mom breaths.

""Eve!"" Enzo says and tries to stand up, but his face cringes in pain and he stays put.

It's only now that I'm noticing the wheelchair next to the two-seat sofa where mom and Enzo are seated.

""Find out what?!"" I howl this time which brings Jason out on the patio in a blink.

""Eve?"" he calls me from my back, but I don't answer.

My eyes are still burning holes in my mom's green irises, already floating in tears.

I shift my eyes to Enzo, anger, and pain mixed in his look, begging me to stop.

""You two?! You and mom?"" I say, tears and sobs choking me, fading my voice.

""Sweetie, you need to listen to us,"" mom says, standing up and walking towards me.

She tries to reach her arms in a hug, but I push them away.

A week ago, I ran into her again in the parking garage, chatted on our way up, I go to get off on my floor, she says to text her. Okay, weird, thought she wasn’t into me. Texted a few times over the next few days, regular conversation, died off. Whatever.

Today I was making something for a potluck at work, I had plenty of extra, so I texted her if she wanted some, she came down immediately, happily took some, inspected everything in my living room while we talked, overall about 30 minutes.

Does this just happen or was I supposed to escalate things? I’ve never had a woman in my apartment that didn’t show up without the expectation to hookup, so is this just… friendship? With a woman?

It’s really nice it but I am a people pleaser and a slave to expectations, I don’t want to be a dork who keeps bringing this girl into my place who is only telling me my cooking is good cause she wants to smash. 

I need to know if my cooking is actually good.

She Doesn't Know That I Know - UPDATE 22 - Happy (belated) Cake Day!,"My cake day on Reddit was the 15th. That was the first time I reached out and told my story. I had already been on reddit with a different account. Honestly I didn't know subreddits like infidelity or cheating stories existed.

While looking at where to post, I happened upon the Adultery subreddit. In case you didn't know, the Adultery subreddit is where people who are cheating on their significant others post and get support for one another. So you have mistresses complaining about how their sugar daddy's wife and kids are monopolizing his time and other scummy demented shit like that. That's where my adultery subreddit pro tips come from.

I created a new user and decided to post on Infidelity and Cheating Stories and my posts were promptly put in limbo due to the fact that my new user had ZERO karma. The infidelity one eventually got approved but it had several days of posts in front of it and very few people saw it. I realized I need to build up karma in order to get support. I talked in a previous post what I did but I eventually built up enough karma to be able to post and not have it wait for approval. 

Then, people started reading my posts and the rest is history I guess. I looked back on the infidelity subreddit and the post where I served Emily divorce papers is like the 3rd top all time post, behind the guy whose brother fathered his kid so he knocks him out every time he sees him, and a poor lady who thinks something is wrong with her because she was cheated on by her husband and then her first boyfriend after her divorce. Just goes to show you that cheating is a character thing and not a gender thing.

Last weekend, me and some of Shreya's other friends (I'm calling them the Diwali crowd) helped move her stuff into a storage unit. She gave away a TON of her furniture and clothes to her girlfriends. I noticed the clothes she got rid of were pretty much all of her less conservative outfits (swimsuits, workout gear, club wear). HA! Mom and Dad wouldn't approve. She took about 4 huge suitcases full of stuff to my house. She's ready to pay the extra fees for the plane I guess. She seemed very interested in staying close together with me and we didn't leave the house much. I ended up taking a couple of days off. She was pretty emotional at the airport, but she said that her parents wouldn't accept a divorced older ""gora"" for a son in law. I felt sad just because of the role she occupied in my life as the only other person I've ever had a sexual relationship with other than my wife and her help in getting over the emasculation caused by my wife's cheating. We both knew going into it that it was a temporary thing but I think it may have hit her harder. Either that or she was putting on a show for my benefit. I appreciate it either way. 

It's weird. I feel a vague sense of loss, but I know it was expected and life will go on. It was a sharp contrast to the end of my marriage which was a fundamental paradigm shift of where I thought my life was headed. I think the difference is that I had a vision and expectation of the future with my wife and absolutely none with Shreya. 

I'm kind of torn now. Should I enter into any relationship with no vision of its outcome and no expectations of the course it will take? Just go day by day with the knowledge that everything could shit the bed at any minute? I think I should at least withhold myself until I see some kind of reciprocity from the other end. But what if the other person feels the same way and also holds back?  Then it's some kind of fucked up love-based mexican standoff. It doesn't seem fair or realistic to wait for reciprocity while not giving anything of yourself.

Since Shreya's gone, the only female companionship I have is my kitten. She's completely black, so it's hard to take a good picture of her. I call her Beans, because she's outgoing and sassy. I say I call her ""Beans"" because she doesn't respond to anything except the sound that a shaking can of cat treats makes. I didn't end up getting the puppy. The deal fell through and I haven't tried very hard to find any replacement.

Beans has decided that I am a piece of furniture. Like a favorite lamp or something. She’ll sit three feet away, facing the wrong direction, pretending she’s not keeping tabs on me. If I move, she relocates. If I stay still too long, she leaves like I’ve become boring. It feels familiar somehow.

She disappears for hours at a time, then reappears like nothing happened, demanding food and affection on her terms. Honestly, she might be the most emotionally well adjusted female in my life right now.

On the female prospect front, I figure I'll enjoy the quiet for a bit. At least through the holidays. There is a girl in my gym accountability group that I work out with sometimes. She seems pretty serious about losing weight and getting fit due to the doctor diagnosing her as prediabetic. She said that's how her grandfather died so she's determined. She's been at it for 3 months and has lost 20 pounds. She's down to earth and pleasant, but she's all business at the gym. She's already planning on being at the gym on the 26th. Like I said: serious. I don't want to screw up the accountability group, though, so I'll just be nice, funny, and helpful for now. I'm pretty thick when it comes to girls indicating interest so it's probably a dead end, but I really admire her drive and tenacity.

In the group chat, Lisa said her oldest daughter wants to change her name to Lisa's maiden name. Lisa is changing back to her maiden name as part of her divorce with John and their oldest daughter wants to do that too. She's not 18. I think she's still 16 or maybe 17 now. I doubt she can change it now without John's consent. I don't know the law, though. If I were her, I'd hold off until John paid off my college tuition. I think she really needs therapy. Infidelity is a bomb with lots of collateral damage.

I'd also like to announce my greatest achievement this year. When we talk, Matt and his wife always refer to their baby as ""the baby"". So I took it upon myself to name her Baroness Peebody von Püppenschlobber. The ü is important. I stressed this. You can’t just slap an umlaut on a name and not commit to it. That’s cultural appropriation. I told them that the name gives her old money gravitas while honoring her life's achievements. Much chuckling and eye rolling ensued. I'm sure they're seriously taking it under advisement, but either way, she's Baroness Peebody von Püppenschlobber to me until she gets married.

I'm headed down to The Villages on the 24th to spend Christmas with dad and his GF and her 2 sons. I'm leaving Beans with Bob and his GF. I briefly considered taking Beans with me, then remembered she panics if I move the coffee table six inches. So Bob’s babysitting because he and his GF are the only friends Beans has met. I told him that this will be the test as to whether or not they can be good parents. No pressure, guys!

Boring update, I know, but I was feeling a little introspective the day after dropping off Shreya at the airport. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, y'all.",94,1766028240.0,u_Any-Assault,21,0.99,False

“What’s going on here? Trudy, what are you doing here?”



“Do you know her?” Dewey asked sharply.



“Sure,” Parker admitted. “She’s a friend of my sister Janet.”



“Well, your sister’s friend just brought me a message from a dead man and I have some questions,” Dewey informed him.



I gasped and whirled to stare at Dewey again. “What did you say?” I whispered.



I wasn't prepared to mix with a bunch of bikers, but when he learned of my computer skills, I was caught.



————————



It was just becoming light outside when Stone walked from his cabin to the shop. The wind off the gulf was cold this morning and he felt glad he had his jacket on. Back behind the shop was another building they used to house their personal vehicles. The air still had its crispness from the cooling of the night. His footsteps echoed as he made his way from one building to the other. The shop was an industrial building housing the workshop he and his men worked out of. The landscape was coated in an early morning haze from the gulf that would burn off as soon as the sun came up. The shop and the cabin behind the chain linked fence were about a mile outside the town of Sabine Pass, Texas. Sabine Pass was close to the border of Louisiana and almost on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico. The days here in the summer were hot and humid, the nights were cooler but not by much.



As he swung the huge doors open, he caught a movement out of the corner of his eye. Turning his head, he saw a figure standing at the gate.



A young girl stood there waiting. On either side of her slight body stood two huge dogs. One dog was jet black and the other was pure white. Both dogs were massive.



Stone hesitated then changed course and walked over to the locked gate. As he neared, the dogs gave a soft growl. The black beast he could see now was an Irish wolfhound while the white was a Great Pyrenes. Both were beautiful animals and Stone knew by how they alerted, they were trained to protect the girl between them. He stopped a few feet away and cocking his head to one side he asked, “Can I help you?”



The girl raised her head and stared at him. Her green eyes took in his tall broad frame, her eyes traveling from his boots up to his dark colored denim jeans, then to his dark blue t-shirt under his lined denim jacket. They took his bulging thighs and ripped arms, then gazed at his thick neck and squared jaw line, shadowed by a white beard. Finally, they flashed up to the dark cowboy hat on his head.



Stone watched as she swallowed and tried to speak. A small woman, he guessed she was barely over five feet tall. Dressed in an oversized flak jacket and jeans. She wore boots and a ridiculous big beret type hat. He couldn’t see what her face or hair looked like, hidden under the brim of the hat. He could see the straps of a backpack around her shoulders. At first, the words wouldn’t come out of her mouth, then she took a deep breath and tried again, “I’m looking for Dewey Mann, is he here?”



Stone nodded. “Yeah, he’s here. Can I ask what you want him for?”



“I need to give him a message from someone...In person.”



Stone reached into his back pocket and brought out his phone. When Dewey answered, he let him know he had someone waiting on him at the front gate.



A few minutes later, Dewey Stone’s VP of the MC came out of his cabin and met them at the gate. He was dressed like Stone, in boots, jeans and a hat.



The girl looked him over carefully then asked, “Are you Dewey Mann?”



Dewey glanced over at Stone. When he looked back at the girl, he nodded. “I am.”



The girl reached into her jacket pocket and brought out an envelope. She pushed the envelope through the chain link fence. “I was asked to give you this message.”



Dewey stepped forward and took the envelope from her. Before he opened the envelope, he pressed the code in to open the gate. Ripping the envelope open, he took out the paper inside and frowned as he began to read it. “Is this some sort of joke?” he growled.



The girl shook her head.



Reaching inside his pants, he pulled out his phone. Pressing the button on the side, he connected with the men in the other cabins. “I’m at the gate. Get your asses out here now.”



Instantly, a door from a cabin opened up and another man came running. He wasn’t as tall as Dewey, but he was just as big.



The girl took a step back and her eyes grew huge.



One by one, three more doors opened and the men came to stand behind Dewey. Behind the first row of cabins was another row of cabins. More men poured out and soon, there were two dozen men standing there.



Dewey turned to look at the girl. “I think you need to come with us for a moment.” He motioned toward the shop.



“I don’t think so,” she protested, backing away. “I was asked to bring you a message and I did that. I have other places to be today.”



As she turned to leave a truck pulled up behind her. Parker Wayne stepped out, still dressed in his police uniform. He stared at Dewey and the rest of the men standing there, then looked to the girl. “What’s going on here? Trudy, what are you doing here?”



“Do you know her?” Dewey asked sharply.



“Sure,” Parker admitted. “She’s a friend of my sister Janet.”



“Well, your sister’s friend just brought me a message from a dead man and I have some questions,” Dewey informed him.



Trudy gasped and whirled to stare at Dewey again. “What did you say?” she whispered. Her face paled and she looked as if she was going to faint.



Dewey stepped toward her but one of the dogs growled another warning. “Are you okay?”



Trudy nodded slowly and gave the dogs a signal with her hand. She went over to Parker’s truck and sat down on the front bumper. Taking a deep breath, she collected herself and pushing the brim of the hat back on her head she glanced up at the men standing there. “All I did was take a message. I don’t know anything else. I don’t know what more I can tell you.”



They all could see her face now and she was pale. The only color she had was the vibrant green of her eyes.



“I need some coffee, let’s move this into the shop,” Dewey suggested as he turned and made his way to the open doors of the shop.



Everyone but Trudy followed him.



Parker turned about half way to the shop and walked back to her. He didn’t get too close to her, having learned his lesson well the first time he attempted that little mistake. He did stick his hands in his pockets and stare at her. “He won’t hurt you, you know,” he spoke quietly. “None of us will. But he wants to talk to you. I think it would be best to just get this over with.”



Trudy nodded. “I know that—but he’s just so big. They all are big. He scares me.”



“He’s a big guy and scary looking but he’d never hurt a woman,” Parker agreed a he squatted down beside her. “You don’t have anything to fear from these guys. None of them will hurt you, I promise you.”



Trudy turned her head and nodded. “I know, but I really can’t stay long. I do have somewhere to be.”



Parker smiled and stood up. Reaching out his hand, he waited for her to take it. “Then answer his questions and he’ll let you leave.”



Trudy took another deep breath and walked toward the shop. The dogs stayed behind her as Parker led her inside the building. The difference in temperature could be felt as soon as they entered. The shop seemed cooler than it was outside but the smell of motor oil and grease hit her nose. While the scent wasn’t unpleasant, it was overwhelming. She sneezed.



Looking up, she saw the lineup of muscled men. They stood leaning up against the long table in front of her.



Dewey stood behind them reaching for the coffee cups on the counter. Pouring from the large pot, he grabbed a couple of cups and turned to face her. He handed her a cup and moved over to another table.



The men moved one by one to grab their coffee, then one by one they all sat down behind Dewey. Stone stood beside him.



Dewey took a sip of the hot brew in his cup and motioned for her to join him.



Trudy moved away from Parker and sat down. Taking off the backpack she carried, she sat down and stared down at the cup in her hand. “What do you want to know?”



“Where did you get the message?”



Trudy glanced at Parker and saw him nod. Licking her dry lips she said, “I was on my computer last night, in one of the chat rooms I go to when this guy started chatting with me. His online call sign was wgn1214. At first he seemed okay, you know just asking routine questions, then when he found out I lived near Sabine Pass he asked me to go to another chat room and talk to him.” She shrugged. “I wasn’t going to, you never know who you’re talking to sometimes, but then he said something that made me want to know more.”



“What was that?” Parker asked.



“He asked me if I cared about men in the military. He told me he needed my help to save some lives. He told me if I could figure out the code he gave me I would be able to get into a secret chat room.” She paused to take a sip of her coffee. “The code was easy enough to figure out and my curiosity was peeked enough to find out what I could. When I got into the chat room, he asked me to get this message to you.”



“Did he say anything else?” Dewey asked.



“Just that he’d make contact again, tonight at 6:00.”



Dewey stared at her for a long minute then called out, “Colten.”



“Yo.” One of the men stood.



Dewey handed him the paper without taking his eyes off her. “Can you decipher this for me?”



Colten took the paper and hissed. “Boss, is this for real?”



Dewey turned his head and stared at the other man. “That’s what I need you to find out for me.”



Colten walked to the kitchen area and began opening drawers in search of a pen and paper. Then he sat down at the other table and began deciphering the message Trudy brought to them. A few minutes later, he put down his pen and got up. Walking toward Dewey, he handed him the papers and moved back to his seat.



Dewey read the translation Colten gave him and frowned. The note said exactly what he thought. He pushed the hat back on his head and rubbed the scars on his forehead. Exhaling loudly, he gazed at Trudy again. “Can you make contact with this man again?”



She shook her head. “He said he would meet me back in the chat room at six tonight.”



Dewey shook his head. “I need to contact him now, I can’t wait until tonight.”



“I could try to track him down,” Colten suggested.



Trudy snorted but didn’t say anything.



Colten turned to her and scowled. “What? I can find him.”



She shook her head and stood up. “Fine, you find him, I have somewhere else to be.”



Dewey stood and moved toward her. “I’m afraid I need you here more than you need to be somewhere else right now.”



Trudy backed up a step. “You said I could leave if I answered your questions. Well, I did that and now, I’m leaving.”



“You need to stay,” Dewey insisted. “We may need your help. If this guy contacts you again, I need to get a message to him.”



Trudy motioned toward Colten. “Let him get your message to this guy. He knows what to say more than I do.”



Dewey cocked his head and waited. “I have a feeling you know more than you’re telling us.”



Trudy backed up another step. “The message told you everything there is to know. I don’t know more than that.”



“How do you know what the message said?” Parker asked. “It was coded.”



Trudy glanced over at him and her face gave him the answer. She knew what the coded message said. “How did you know?”



Dewey’s eyes narrowed. “What do you mean?”



Parker turned. “She read the message.”



“Yeah so? She brought the message here,” Dewey reminded him.



Parker shook his head. “She knows what the message is about.”



Dewey turned his head and stared at Trudy for a moment, then he took a step toward her.



She took a step back as something flashed in her eyes and she raised up to her full height, all of two inches over five feet. “Your message wasn’t all that hard to figure out.”



“But it was a code we ourselves made up,” Dewey told her. “No one but a code breaker could figure it out.”



“Didn’t take me long,” Trudy repeated.



“Just who are you?” Dewey asked.



“Me?” she asked shrugging. “I’m nobody.”



“Why do I doubt that very much?” Dewey asked nobody in particular.



Trudy scooped up her pack and flinging it over her shoulder, she turned to walk toward the doors. The dogs stood and made their way to either side of her.



Before she could get to the door, the men got there and barred her from leaving. Even Parker stood there, refusing to let her leave. His face set in stone. They all wore the same hard look.



Trudy knew she wasn’t going anywhere until they had their answers. Answers she didn’t want to give them.



A single set of footsteps came up behind her. They belonged to the biggest man here. She turned and stared at Dewey. He motioned for her to sit again, and Trudy moved back to the table.



“Dewey,” Stone finally spoke up. “What is this all about?”



“That’s what we’re about to find out.” Dewey told him. “But to catch you up, when we were fighting in the sandbox, we had to come up with a way to communicate that only we knew. Too many of our messages were getting decoded by the enemy and we were black ops. We couldn’t afford our messages to get caught up in enemy hands.” He turned to look at Trudy. “She decoded a message from one of my men. A man we thought had died by enemy hands.”



“Well.” Stone growled.

My friend Mia and I were walking outside.Then Mia replied with a grin that faltered slightly. “Have you heard what people have been saying? About Macarius's ex Lisa. She's... pregnant, and she's claiming it's his.""



The words hit me like a punch to the gut, filling me with a mix of anger and insecurity. For a moment, the world around me seemed to blur, the sound of crunching snow fading beneath the weight of those words.



Then I went home to confront him about it.



I headed to our bedroom. With a tentative hand, I pushed the door open, revealing a sight that struck me to my core.



Macarius was in bed with Lisa with clothes scattered all over the floor.



I stood in stunned silence, the air heavy with disbelief, unable to find words to express my shock.



""Cora, I can explain... Lisa, you need to get dressed and leave now."" Macarius said urgently.



""What? Why? You told me you were leaving her!"" Lisa sneered in response.



“You two bitches, get the he-ll out of my house!”



——————



On the day before Christmas Eve, the snow had fallen gently upon the town. Cora and Macarius had made the decision to stroll through the wintry streets, aiming to rendezvous with some friends. As they ambled along, they gazed upon the Christmas trees adorned with radiant lights, marveling at the ornaments that adorned them. Their spirits were uplifted as they reveled in the holiday decorations, wrapped in a festive atmosphere.



During their leisurely walk, an old female friend approached them, her warm smile directed towards Macarius. At the time, Cora didn't give much heed to what appeared to be innocent flirtation, dismissing it as harmless banter. After exchanging pleasantries, they bid farewell to their old friend and continued their journey to join the eagerly awaiting group of friends.



""Come on, hurry up, Macarius. We'll be late!"" Cora urged. She tugged at his arm, a sense of urgency coursing through her.



Macarius, a hint of exasperation in his eyes, retorted, ""What's the rush? They already know we're on our way, Cora."" He rolled his eyes in response to his fiancée's impatience, though a touch of amusement played in his voice.



""Because Tiff has a special announcement, and she wants everyone there,"" Cora explained as she gently tugged at Macarius's arm, leading him toward the restaurant.



Macarius chuckled, his laughter filling the crisp winter air as he navigated the snowy terrain, determined not to stumble. Smirking mischievously, he stooped down to collect a handful of snow, quickly shaping it into a well-packed ball. In an instant, before Cora could react, she was unexpectedly pelted by a snowball from behind, a surprise that sent a shiver down her spine, followed by a fit of laughter.



""Oh, so you want to play dirty and throw a snowball at me?"" Cora laughed heartily, her eyes twinkling with mirth, as she leaned down to gather a handful of snow, deftly forming it into a perfectly packed snowball. ""Two can play that game,"" she declared with a mischievous smirk before swiftly retaliating, flinging her snowball in Macarius's direction.



Macarius, his eyes alight with delight, braced himself for the incoming onslaught.



With a grin, he expertly dodged Cora's retaliation, but not without a sense of exhilaration, and he playfully teased, ""You'll have to do better than that, my love!""



The wintry air was filled with the sounds of their laughter and playful banter, a delightful scene of pure joy in the midst of the snowy wonderland.



\*\*\*



Finally, they arrived at the restaurant, laughter and the warmth of their intertwined hands creating an aura of love that seemed to radiate through the wintry Christmas scene. Cora and Macarius, high school sweethearts, had a bond that had only deepened over the years, and it was evident in the way they shared affectionate glances and smiles. Their hearts connected like ornaments on a beautifully decorated Christmas tree.



Inside the restaurant, the cozy ambiance and the scent of holiday spices enveloped them, adding to the enchanting atmosphere of the season.



They were greeted with familiar faces and warm embraces as friends called out cheerfully, ""Cora! Macarius! You made it!""



""It's about time you two got here!""



Laughter and hugs pa-ssed around the table as they joined their group. Coats were shed, seats were claimed, and friendly chatter rippled through the room as everyone settled in. Holiday music played softly in the background, mixing with the clinking of gla-sses and silverware as conversations bubbled with excitement.



Once everyone had taken their seats and the conversations began to quiet, a cozy hush fell over the table. Tiff and her fiancé, Dan, stood up, sharing a nervous but excited glance.



Tiff, her eyes sparkling with joy, addressed their friends.



""So now that everyone is finally here, we have some very exciting news to share with you all.""



Dan, his voice filled with elation, spoke up, ""I've asked Tiff to marry me, and she said 'yes.' So, with that, we have invited you all here to let you know that not only are we engaged, but you guys are also an essential part of our wedding.""



A chorus of cheers and applause filled the restaurant, and the joyful atmosphere of Christmas seemed to intensify as their friends celebrated the love and good news that wrapped the room in a warm, cozy embrace.



In the cozy, Christmas-adorned room, cheers and congratulations rang out as everyone celebrated Tiff and Dan's upcoming wedding. Cora, her heart warmed by the joyous occasion, cast a fond glance at Macarius, sharing an affectionate smile with her high school sweetheart.



She leaned gently against Macarius and, in a hushed tone, whispered in his ear, ""So, when are we going to get engaged?""



Macarius, his eyes locked with Cora's, responded with a tender smile, ""Soon, my love, soon. I want ours to be special."" He sealed his words with a gentle ki-ss on her cheek, leaving Cora with a warmth that matched the holiday season.



Sighing, Cora shifted her attention back to Tiff and their circle of friends, her initial elation now tinged with a sense that something was amiss, though she couldn't quite put her finger on it amidst the festive atmosphere.



They all waited for dinner to be brought out, and when it arrived, the delightful aroma of nostalgia filled the air. The feast that followed was nothing short of a holiday extravaganza.



The table was adorned with the usual Christmas dinner staples, with a lavish spread of turkey, ham, and mashed potatoes, accompanied by all the traditional fixings. The tantalizing scent of the warm, hearty dishes filled the room, creating an inviting and mouthwatering atmosphere. As they moved to dessert, there were luscious choices of pumpkin pie, apple pie, and other sweet treats, adding to the merriment of the evening.



As the servers presented their plates, gratitude flowed from the guests, filling the room with a sense of shared warmth and appreciation. Then, as the festive holiday dishes were laid out before them, the room came alive with the sounds of clinking cutlery and the soft murmurs of satisfaction as everyone delved into their meal, savoring each bite and celebrating the joy of Christmas and the love that bound them together.



After everyone had finished their meal, Cora and Macarius rose from their seats and made their way over to the elated couple. Once more, they offered their heartfelt congratulations, sharing warm hugs that radiated the genuine spirit of Christmas. With goodbyes and well wishes exchanged, they departed the festive restaurant, the cold winter air greeting them as they stepped outside.



As they strolled through the snow-covered streets, Cora's emotions swirled. She couldn't help but feel a mix of happiness for her best friend, and a tinge of jealousy as she thought about her own relationship with Macarius. They had been together longer, and yet, they weren't married. A quiet sigh escaped her lips as she wondered, in the midst of the enchanting Christmas season, would Macarius ever propose to her?



Cora and Macarius made their way back to their home, the wintry Christmas charm still lingering in the air. As they reached their front door, Macarius cast a concerned glance at Cora.



""You've been quiet the whole time we've been walking,"" he observed.



Cora looked up at him, offering a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. ""Oh, sorry. I was just thinking about Tiff and Dan's upcoming wedding and wondering what the colors will be,"" she fibbed, concealing her true thoughts.



Macarius, seemingly unperturbed, replied, ""Well, I suppose the colors will be the same as they are now.""



He didn't press further, content to maintain the festive mood. They proceeded inside, prepared for bed, and nestled together, the warm comfort of their shared love easing them into a peaceful Christmas night.



Cora awoke brimming with excitement on Christmas Eve and roused Macarius from his slumber.



""Wake up, Macarius! It's Christmas Eve. Let's head to town for a festive breakfast,"" she exclaimed.



Macarius, groaning, rolled over, rubbed his eyes, and squinted at the clock. ""Cora, it's only 5 a.m. Go back to sleep,"" he grumbled, stifling a yawn.



Undeterred, Cora persisted, shaking him gently once more. ""Come on, Macarius, please. By the time we're ready to go, it'll be 6 a.m. anyway.""



Macarius had dozed off, paying no heed to Cora's enthusiasm. In exasperation, she gave him a firm push and then left the bed to retrieve some clothes from their closet.



With determination in her steps, she headed to their bathroom and placed her attire on the sink. She turned on the shower, patiently awaiting the warm water to embrace her. As the comforting stream began to flow, she stepped into the inviting cascade, a sigh of contentment escaping her lips.



As she lathered her hair with shampoo, the bathroom door creaked open. Macarius entered, taking a moment to survey her silhouette beneath the cascading water. A sly grin curled upon his lips.



""Here, let me a-ssist you with that,"" he playfully teased, his voice laced with mirth.



Macarius inched closer to Cora, a playful glint in his eye, and gently turned her around, his strong hands poised to ma-ssage her head. The Christmas Eve ambiance heightened the anticipation in the room, and Cora couldn't help but release a soft, contented moan as his skilled fingers worked their magic. The atmosphere crackled with subtle, unspoken desires, creating a palpable undercurrent of longing between them.



After Macarius was done ma-ssaging the shampoo thoroughly into her hair he moved her over to the water. As the water was cascading down her body, Cora closed her eyes, letting the warmth of it seep into her body. Macarius slowly slid his hands down to her nip-ples teasing them.



Cora peeked at him, a glimmer of desire in them. She slapped his hands away playfully. ""We're supposed to be taking a shower, Macarius,"" she groaned.



Macarius wasn't listening and slid his hands further down her body. He rubbed her stomach before going further down to her sweet spot. Slowly he inched his hands between her thighs.



""Hmm... what were you saying?"" he teased as his fingers neared her opening.



Cora grabbed his hands and glared at him before she brought him closer to her. ""Macarius, I mean it!"" she said as she turned to grab her conditioner, her gaze still locked on Macarius.



Suddenly, he slapped her a-ss, making her squeal with delight. When she straightened up again, the glint of arousal in her eyes was unmistakable. She smirked and wrapped her hand around his now hardened co-ck, leaning in close and teasingly licking her lips.



Getting onto her knees, Cora smiled mischievously before taking his engorged member into her mouth. Macarius moaned, his head resting against the wall as he closed his eyes and let himself become lost in the pleasure.



When she saw that he was completely at her mercy, Cora straightened, satisfaction flickering across her face. She'd gotten exactly what she wanted.



Macarius stirred, a quiet groan slipping past his lips as his eyes fluttered open. ""Why did you stop?"" he asked, voice rough, thick with need.



Her laughter rang soft and teasing. ""Now you know how it feels,"" she said, reminding him of the night he'd left her breathless and wanting.



Cora turned away then, reaching for the bottle of conditioner. The scent of it mingled with the warmth of the steam, an unspoken charge hanging between them. Her movements were unhurried and measured as though she knew every motion was driving him mad.



Under the steady cascade of water, she worked the conditioner through her hair, her gaze occasionally flicking toward him. The air pulsed with tension, thick and electric, neither of them saying what they both knew—this game between them was far from over.



Cora, with a sensual grace, finished washing her hair under the cascading water, allowing the stream to rinse away the soap. Her gaze remained tantalizingly locked onto Macarius as she picked up her body wash, her movements deliberate and alluring. With each stroke, she caressed her body, casting a captivating spell upon the room, as the sensual tension between them simmered.



""Why do you gotta tease me like this?"" Macarius groaned, his voice heavy with longing, his desire echoing the palpable yearning that enveloped them.



Cora, her eyes dancing with playful desire, responded, ""Like what?""



She continued to sensually rub the body wash down her glistening legs, the erotic dance between them intensifying.



Macarius couldn't resist another longing groan before he reached for his own two-in-one shampoo and conditioner, poured some into his hands, and began washing his body, the scene awash with a tantalizing, unspoken connection.



Once their shared shower was complete, Cora shut off the cascading water and gracefully stepped out. She swiftly secured one towel around her damp hair, another around her curvaceous form. Macarius followed her lead, his strong hands meticulously drying his glistening skin before he wrapped the towel low on his hips. He exited the bathroom, his sculpted physique resonating with sensuality, in search of clothing to don.



Cora, her own form still slightly flushed from their intimate shower, sighed and pursued him with a hint of confusion and affection in her eyes.



""Why are you being so grumpy?"" she inquired, a playful tease that carried with it a touch of the lingering sexual tension.



Macarius left the room without uttering a single word, his actions leaving Cora in a state of stunned silence. She stood there, her gaze fixed upon his retreating figure as he exited the room, offering neither a parting word nor even a backward glance. It was a moment of profound and disconcerting silence, and within her, Cora felt her heart fracture into two.



As unbidden tears began their descent down her cheeks, she hastened to brush them away, summoning an air of determination as she retrieved her clothes from the bathroom and hastily dressed.



With her emotions in tumultuous disarray, Cora hurried after Macarius, her mind awhirl with confusion and concern. She found him in their living room, his gaze lost in contemplation as he stared out of the window, the weight of his unspoken turmoil hanging heavily in the air. With a quivering voice that betrayed her own apprehension, she approached him, her questions laden with the ache of their shared emotional discord.



""Macarius, what is going on? Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?"" she inquired, the fragile threads of their relationship stretched taut with unspoken tension.



Macarius shifted his gaze, his eyes veiling a profound secret that left Cora in a state of perplexity, unable to decipher the emotions that hid behind his mysterious demeanor.



""While you were in the shower, I received a call from an old girlfriend,"" he divulged, his voice carrying a somber, subdued tone.



Cora's curiosity piqued, and she couldn't help but inquire, ""And what did she want? What did she say?""



The room was suffused with unspoken tension, and the atmosphere felt heavier with every pa-ssing moment.



Macarius, his emotions carefully guarded, merely shook his head and stated, ""We'll talk about it after Christmas, okay? I don't want to spoil the holidays."" His words hung in the air, heavy with the unsaid, as they both grappled with the emotions that had stirred between them, the unspoken tension casting a shadow upon the festive celebration.



Cora nodded in understanding and gracefully sauntered over to Macarius. With a tender and longing expression in her eyes, she wrapped her arms around him, pulling him into an intimate embrace. Their lips met in a pa-ssionate ki-ss, a silent but potent declaration of their affection for one another.



""I'm sure that no matter what challenges come our way, we can face them together,"" she murmured, her voice filled with unwavering determination, her fingers gently tracing patterns on his back as she held him close.



Macarius sighed deeply, a hint of vulnerability and doubt shimmering in his eyes.



""I certainly hope so,"" he confessed.



On Christmas morning, Cora and Macarius strolled into the cozy kitchen, their hearts filled with excitement. They decided to savor a hearty breakfast before heading into town to reunite with their dear friends. The room was bathed in soft, warm hues as the morning sunlight streamed in, casting a gentle glow on the rustic wooden table.



Cora, her eyes sparkling with anticipation, reached for the eggs, milk, fresh bread, and a generous portion of sizzling bacon. As she prepared their meal, the aroma of their breakfast filled the air, its savory scent mingling with the hint of freshly brewed coffee. Macarius, leaning against the kitchen counter, observed her every move with a tender smile.



""Cora,"" he said, his voice filled with affection, ""you have a way of making even the simplest breakfast seem like a feast.""



She looked up, meeting his gaze, and her heart skipped a beat. ""It's all about the little things, Macarius especially on a special day like today.""



He nodded, their eyes locked in a moment that brimmed with unspoken emotions, the anticipation of the day ahead charging the air between them. After all, there was something about Christmas that always seemed to enhance the connection they shared.



With breakfast prepared and the promise of a wonderful day ahead, Cora and Macarius savored the magic of the season and the unspoken promise of their relationship.



They indulged in their delicious breakfast, engaging in a lively conversation about the day's upcoming events. Their voices were filled with anticipation, and their smiles conveyed the joy that the festive season brought. They understood that their plans included a much-anticipated gathering with friends in town, adding an extra layer of excitement to the day.



As they finished their meal, they quickly cleared the table, their shared effort a testament to their easy camaraderie. Cora's cheeks were slightly flushed from the warmth of the kitchen, and Macarius couldn't help but admire her grace. Their closeness was undeniable, and the unspoken promise of the day's festivities added an electrifying tension between them.



With the dishes cleared, they retreated to their rooms to prepare for the day ahead, knowing that the anticipation of seeing their friends was only rivaled by the unspoken emotions they shared making this one they would remember forever.



Once they had donned their cozy winter attire, Cora and Macarius ventured out from their home, braving the chill as they made their way into town. The town was blanketed in a gentle cascade of snowflakes, each one a delicate work of art in itself.



Cora, her cheeks rosy from the cold, couldn't resist looking up at the sky, extending her hand to catch a few of these ephemeral crystals.



Macarius watched her with a fond smile, his breath forming misty clouds in the crisp air. As the snowflakes landed in her open palm, he couldn't help but admire her childlike wonder, a reflection of the joy that the holiday season brought.



""Come on, silly,"" he chuckled, leaning in closer, the air thick with a subtle but undeniable tension. ""We have to make a quick stop at the shop before we join our friends.""



Cora met his gaze, her eyes sparkling with both amusement and an undercurrent of something more, a connection that was unspoken but felt in every shared glance. The allure of the season seemed to heighten their closeness, and they continued their journey through the snow-covered streets, knowing that the day held more than just the promise of festivities with friends.



They reached the heart of town and stepped into a quaint, charming store, its windows adorned with a festive display of holiday trinkets.



Inside, they found an array of items, precisely what they needed for the occasion. Cora and Macarius, their fingers brushing lightly as they browsed through the selections, chose a few thoughtful gifts for their dear friends. With the chosen gifts in hand, they entrusted them to the store clerk, who skillfully wrapped each one with an artful touch, adding a piece of elegance to the heartfelt presents.



As they left the store, a sense of warmth and satisfaction washed over them, their hearts brimming with gratitude. They couldn't help but share a glance, their emotions dancing beneath the surface—a connection that was deeper and more profound than mere friendship. It was in that moment, amidst the twinkling lights and the soft echoes of carols playing in the background, that they knew this Christmas held a special significance.



With their beautifully wrapped gifts in tow, they finally arrived at their designated meeting spot, a place transformed into a holiday wonderland, decked out in all the festive trappings of the holiday, setting the stage for a day filled with shared joy.



They greeted their friends joyfully as they placed the items on the table.



""Hey everyone, how's it going?"" Cora and Macarius said at the same time.



Their friends Greg, Elise, and a few others burst out laughing. ""Still finishing each other's sentences, I see,"" Greg teased.



Cora grinned, brushing a lock of hair behind her ear. ""What can I say? It's a gift.""



Elise leaned over to hug her. ""You look gorgeous, as always. I swear, even the snow envies you.""



""Stop,"" Cora said with a laugh, hugging her back. ""You're just saying that because you want me to bring dessert again next year.""



""Caught me,"" Elise replied, smirking.



The group laughed easily, slipping into familiar rhythms that spoke of years of friendship. They chatted about gifts, travel plans, and who had the worst wrapping skills this year—Greg lost by unanimous vote, judging by the lopsided corners on his pile.



""So, what are your plans after the holidays are over?"" Greg asked as he reached for a roll.



Cora shrugged with a small smile. ""Not sure yet. We'll have to see where the new year takes us.""



""Somewhere warm, hopefully,"" Elise chimed in dramatically. ""If I see another snowflake, I might pack up and move to Hawaii.""



Cora laughed. ""You say that every year, and every year you're right here complaining over hot cocoa.""



""Yeah, because you two make it impossible to leave,"" Elise said warmly. ""Christmas isn't the same without you.""



Macarius smiled, his hand brushing Cora's under the table. ""I think we'll stay close to home for now,"" he said softly. ""There's something about this place and all of you that keeps us grounded.""



The group fell quiet for a heartbeat, the kind of silence that wasn't awkward but full of unspoken appreciation. Then laughter rose again, light and easy, carrying through the room along with the scent of cinnamon and roasted spices. They talked about resolutions, half-formed dreams, and the little moments that made life feel whole.



Dinner arrived soon after, their plates filled with warmth and tradition.



As they tucked into their meal, Cora glanced at Macarius mischievously, running her foot up his leg beneath the table. Macarius shivered slightly, giving her a stern look that only caused her to giggle.



Cora quickly retracted her foot and resumed eating her meal. After dinner, they stayed and socialized for a while longer before deciding it was time to head back home.



After they said their farewells, they began their journey home.



Once they arrived at their house, Macarius pinned Cora against the door and planted a pa-ssionate ki-ss on her lips. Cora responded eagerly, her heart pounding with excitement and anticipation. They embraced for a few moments before Macarius slowly stepped away, their eyes still locked in a loving gaze.



Macarius unlocked the door, the key turning smoothly in the lock, and he ushered Cora into their home. With a soft click, he closed the door behind them, sealing them in the cozy embrace of their private sanctuary. His eyes remained fixed on Cora, captivated by her presence and the unspoken emotions that coursed between them.



""Why don't we go get ready for bed before I give you my present?"" he suggested, his voice laced with a mischievous smirk.



The air crackled with anticipation, and his words were filled with a promise that sent a thrilling shiver down Cora's spine. The warmth of the holiday still lingered, but now it blended with the heady sense of desire, making this Christmas night a celebration of not only festive joy but also the pa-ssionate connection they shared.



Both of them hurried to their room, a shared sense of excitement and playfulness permeating the air. Laughter bubbled between them as they quickly changed into more comfortable attire, savoring the simplicity and intimacy of the moment.



Cora, her heart racing with anticipation, swung the bedroom door open, turning to Macarius with a seductive yet playful glance.



With the subtlest of gestures, she used her fingers to beckon him, her eyes locked with his in a silent invitation. The room itself seemed to hold its breath, aware of the tension that had been building throughout the day. Their connection, a blend of affection and desire, was electric, and as they stepped into the room together, the world outside seemed to fade away, leaving them in a private sanctuary where unspoken emotions could finally be explored.



Macarius' lips curled into a smirk as he sauntered into the room and made his way towards her. His hands lightly guided her onto the bed as he leaned in and pa-ssionately ki-ssed her. He ripped her clothes off with a feverish intensity, his gaze taking in every inch of her body. She let out a moan of pleasure as his hands moved along her curves, sending shivers of delight coursing through her. His touch was electric, igniting a pa-ssionate fire within her. She looked up at him with a smoldering intensity, her eyes heavy with desire.



His touch ignited her body, and she shivered beneath him.



""God, I've been waiting for this moment for what feels like an eternity. Especially after what happened in the shower,"" he growled against her lips.



The air around them was charged with electricity, and his touch sent a fire through her veins. She wanted nothing more than to surrender to the moment and let him take her away to a place of pure bliss.



His hands roamed her body, exploring her curves as he deepened the ki-ss. He trailed ki-sses along her neck, sending sparks of pleasure coursing through her veins. His hands moved lower, and she gasped in anticipation. His touch was gentle yet firm, and her body responded to it eagerly.



He paused, his gaze locking with hers as he brushed her hair away from her face. His lips curved into a smile that spoke of promises and pa-ssion. He leaned in for another ki-ss, this time more gentle and tender.



His hands moved to her hips as he pressed against her, her breath coming in little gasps of pleasure. She wanted more, and he was more than happy to oblige. He moved her body in a way that made her feel ecstasy, her heart pounding as she soared higher and higher.



The pleasure was all-consuming, devouring them until they were both lost in its beauty. Every movement of his body and every caress of his touch brought them closer and closer together until, finally, they were overcome with bliss. They lay there together, completely spent, their bodies intertwined in a languid embrace.

How certain social and/or work situations seem so normal to me now, but would cause me overwhelming anxiety or panic when I was on caffeine. I still have anxious thoughts and feelings, but they are no longer fueled and exacerbated by the caffeine. 

For me, caffeine seemed to put all of my emotions on full blast. The positive emotions, and the negative ones. It could make me feel genuine joy in doing menial tasks, but also pull me down dark emotional paths. Every cup of coffee was like strapping myself to a rocket and hoping for the best.

I believe that is what makes it so hard to quit for some people. After a while of abstinence, you start to forget the negatives and romanticize the positives. 

Being caffeine free I started to notice my emotions stabilize. I was relieved to not feel the anxiety anymore, but also missed the “highs” that caffeine brought. But I have learned slowly but surely that inner peace is worth more than fleeting highs.",3,1766027857.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

 “You’ll be fine, Mom. I promise.”

 I smiled, even if it felt like lying through my teeth. “My job pays well, I’ve got savings, we’ll handle the chemo soon.”

 I had to be strong. For both of us.

 She gave a weak sigh, eyes glistening. “You shouldn’t be wasting your life on me, Venus. You’re only twenty-two. You should be out there living, dancing, falling in love…”

 “Stop.” I tucked a stray curl behind her ear and kissed her forehead. “You don’t worry about anything. I’ve got us.”

 Her voice dropped. “How’s your dad?”

 My jaw clenched.

 Of course, she couldn’t meet my eyes. The man hadn’t visited once since her diagnosis.

 “I haven’t seen him since Sunday,” I said flatly. “And I hope I don’t. It’s been peaceful.”

 She opened her mouth—probably to defend him again—but I stood. “I have to get to work, Mom. I’ll see you later.”

 “Thank you for coming every day, sweetheart. I don’t deserve you.”

 “You do,” I said, hugging her. “I’m your daughter. That’s all that matters.”

 \------

 I hailed a cab, dropped into the backseat, and clutched my bag like my life depended on it. Inside was the file. The file. The one Aaron Sinclair had tossed onto my desk last night like a time bomb.

 You’d check twice too if you worked for a man like him—dangerous in Dior, heartless in Hugo. He’s the kind of man who walks into a room and makes gravity shift. Broad shoulders. Razor jaw. Hazel eyes that could slice through you if his words hadn’t already done it.

 To every other woman, he’s a fantasy. To me? A nightmare in tailored suits.

 Two months working under him, and I swear he gets off on making my life miserable. Impossible deadlines, inhuman workload, cold stares that could freeze hell itself. And yet he hasn’t fired me. Because no matter how much he wants to break me, I always deliver.

 Why not quit, you ask?

 Because I can’t. I was a waitress before this, barely surviving. This job is the reason my mother has a bed in a hospital and not a floor in a rundown clinic. I have a degree, yes. But the world doesn’t pay in potential, it pays in cold, hard results.

 The cab pulled up in front of the towering steel-and-glass building I now called hell. I paid, got out, and took a deep breath.

 Showtime.

 \------

 The second I stepped into my office—just a thin wall away from Mr. Sinclair’s—the intercom rang.

 “My office. Now.”

 No greeting. Just that voice. Sharp. Clipped. Cold.

 “God, give me strength,” I muttered and walked to his door.

 Knock.

 “Come in.”

 I entered and stood straighter than usual. “Good morning, Mr. Sinclair. You called for me?”

 He didn’t look up right away. When he did, those hazel eyes locked on mine like a sniper's target.

 “Sit,” he said, irritation laced in every syllable.

 I sat. The silence stretched. Long enough to make me fidget. Then—

 “Marry me.”

 I blinked. My brain stalled.

 “What?”

 “Don’t make me repeat myself,” he said smoothly, like he hadn’t just shattered reality.

 And just like that, my nightmare said he wanted to make it legal.

Chapter 2

VENUS

 “Marry me.”

 My brain short-circuited.

 “W-what?” I blinked, pushing up my oversized glasses—scratched, crooked, and clinging to life like my sanity. His eyes tracked the motion, brimming with disdain. Typical.

 “You heard me,” he replied coolly, like he’d just asked for a meeting reschedule, not proposed marriage to the woman he’s treated like corporate lint for two months straight.

 God, I loathe this man.

 “What, is this some new psychological warfare tactic?” I folded my arms. “Because the emotional labor you’ve inflicted isn’t quite enough?”

 “Marry me and I—”

 “No.” My voice cut through the tension like a blade. Sharp. Final.

 He blinked. Just once. But I saw it—surprise. As if the idea of being turned down had never occurred to him.

 “No?” he echoed, mildly offended.

 Didn't think I'd ever speak back, did you?

 “Want it in Spanish? French? Morse code?”

 “You haven’t even heard my offer.”

 “I don’t want your offer.” My voice rose. “I’m not interested in whatever twisted bargain you’ve cooked up in that emotionally unavailable brain of yours.”

 He leaned back in his chair, lips twitching. Not quite a smirk, something colder.

 “One million dollars.”

 Silence. 

 My heart stuttered. He's crazy. I was genuinely concerned now, Did he hit his head or something?

 “A million?” I asked, incredulous. “You think throwing money at me will fix the months you’ve spent micromanaging me into oblivion? You’ve treated me like disposable help, now suddenly I’m bride material?”

 “You’ll have time to consider,” he said evenly. Calm. Measured. Calculating. Like he hadn’t just upended my world.

 I scoffed and slammed a folder on his desk. “Here’s the report you asked for. And no, I’m not for sale. You’re not the devil in disguise, Sinclair. You are the disguise.”

 Then I walked out.

 And for the first time since I started working for him… there was no retaliation. No snide remarks. No passive-aggressive memos.

 Just silence.

 It should’ve felt like peace.

 It didn’t.

 By the time I left work, the weight of it all was pressing on my chest—like the moment before a storm. I ran into Jude at the elevator.

 “You’re heading out early,” he noted.

 “Yeah,” I said with a tired smile. “Gotta check on Mom.”

 “Tell her I said hi.”

 I nodded, waved, and headed home hoping for quiet.

 I got it.

 But not the kind I wanted.

 The apartment was still. Too still.

 I opened my bedroom door and my stomach sank.

 Drawers overturned. Sheets yanked off. My closet wide open like a wound.

 “No,” I whispered, lunging for the box under my bed.

 Empty.

 All of it gone. Every dollar I’d scraped and saved for Mom’s chemo. Months of tips, late nights, skipped meals vanished.

 There was no sign of forced entry. No broken windows. No lock tampering.

 Just one conclusion.

 Only one person had a key.

 Only one person had ever taken more from me than he gave.

 Dain.

Chapter 3

VENUS

 I wiped my eyes before stepping into Mom’s ward. They must’ve been swollen. I hadn't stopped crying since dawn, and Dain? Still not picking up.

 “Hey, Mom,” I said, faking a smile so fragile it could crack if she blinked too hard.

 Her expression shifted instantly. “Venus, what’s wrong? You’ve been crying.”

 Of course she saw through it. She always does.

 “Yeah… my boss is being an ass again,” I lied. The truth would break her. And I couldn’t add one more crack to her already-fractured world.

 “Venus—” she started softly.

 “It was my fault. I don’t wanna talk about it,” I muttered, brushing it off like it didn’t weigh a ton.

 She didn’t push. Just reached for my hand. “Okay, darling. You don’t have to.”

 I nodded, swallowing the lump in my throat. “Did Dain come by?”

 “No... is he back home?” Her voice lifted, blooming with a hope that made me sick.

 That man didn’t deserve her hope.

 “No. He hasn’t.” My voice turned cold, sharp and bitter. She noticed.

 “Venus—”

 “I should go. You need rest. Chemo starts next week.”

 Another lie. It scorched my throat. God, I needed to make it true before it killed her.

 We hugged. She smelled like antiseptic and lavender. I held on too long. Then I left.

 The hospital was close, but each step felt like dragging a dead body—mine. The weight of hopelessness pressed on my shoulders, heavy and relentless. I kept hearing it—his voice.

 Marry me.

 Was he serious? Was it a game? A trap he’d enjoy watching me writhe in?

 The thought sickened me. The fact I was considering it? Worse.

 When I reached home, the front door was cracked open.

 No.

 I knew I locked it.

 I stepped in and there he was. Dain. Sprawled on the couch, reeking of sweat and stale alcohol. Passed out, useless.

 Disgust burned up my throat.

 I grabbed a cup, filled it with water, and dumped it on his face.

 “Get up, you asshole.”

 He bolted upright, sputtering. “What the fuck?! You little—”

 “You stole my money, Dain! Where is it?!”

 His bloodshot eyes lit up with smugness. “You had that much stashed and let Billy rough me up for peanuts? Selfish little bitch.”

 “You were never supposed to touch it. It was for Mom’s chemo.”

 He scoffed. “Why bother? She’s dying anyway.”

 That was it.

 “Shut up,” I snarled. “Shut your fucking mouth!”

 And then he slapped me.

 Hard.

 “That’s no way to talk to your father,” he slurred. “Didn’t your mother teach you—”

 I snapped.

 My eyes locked on a broken shard of glass near the table. I grabbed it, hand trembling but firm.

 “Get out. Now. Or I swear to God, I’ll gut you.”

 He paused. Blinked.

 The threat landed.

 He raised his hands, backing away. “Let’s not be hasty—”

 “I said get out!” I screamed, lunging a step forward.

 He stumbled. Then bolted.

 As the door slammed shut, I collapsed. Sinking to my knees, hands shaking, chest heaving. Then the tears came—violent, uncontrollable. Not soft sobs. This was grief, rage, helplessness all tangled in one.

 I sat in that storm for a long time.

 When the shaking slowed, I cleaned the house like it could scrub my shame. But I couldn’t outrun one thought:

 Mr. Sinclair.

 Maybe I should’ve listened. Maybe I should’ve asked more questions. Maybe—just maybe—he was serious.

 I hated him. Hated how cold he was. How powerful. How he always seemed ten steps ahead. But I had nothing left.

 Desperate people make stupid choices.

 I picked up my phone.

 He answered on the fourth ring.

 “About your offer…” My voice was hollow. “Were you serious?”

 “Yes.” No hesitation. No emotion. Just cold certainty.

 “Then I’ll take it,” I whispered. My pride shattered like glass on tile.

 “Good,” he said. Like he knew I’d fold. “We’ll discuss the terms tomorrow. At the office.”

 Click.

 Just like that, I traded my freedom for hope.

 If it saves her... maybe it’s worth it.

Chapter 4

AARON

 “She told me I’d fucking lost my mind and walked out,” I ranted, gripping the glass in my hand like it might keep me from exploding. Connor, the bastard, just laughed like I’d said the funniest joke of the year.

 “It isn’t funny,” I growled, though part of me knew it kind of was.

 “With that kind of approach, what did you expect, asshole?” he asked, finally sobering a little as he took a swig from his beer. “You’ve made her life a living hell for the past few months then out of nowhere, you waltz in and tell her to marry you? And you think she’d just... what? Say yes? Like you’re her Prince Charming or something? You’re fucking delusional.”

 I clenched my jaw, but I didn’t argue. Connor’s my best friend for a reason—he doesn’t sugarcoat shit. He never has. Doesn’t mean it’s easy to swallow when he spits the truth straight down your throat.

 “You came up with the idea,” I muttered bitterly, “Now I have to come up with Plan B. If I don’t get married within a month, all my hard work, my sacrifices, everything I’ve built, it’ll all go to waste.”

 Leave it to my grandfather to still have his claws in my life from beyond the grave. I hope you’re enjoying the show, old man. You always did love theatrics.

 The Will was read yesterday—my grandfather’s final punch from the beyond. According to it, I inherit 65% of the business empire, including the company we built together, only if I get married a month after his death. If I don’t, it all goes to my sorry excuse of a father.

 That will never happen. Over my dead fucking body.

 My grandfather practically raised me. He was the only real father figure I had growing up. I owe him everything. My drive, my grit, my ambition. But the man had a flair for drama, and apparently, he couldn’t rest in peace without one final power move. He knew how I felt about marriage. He knew the trauma my parents’ disaster of a union left behind. And yet, he still went ahead with this absurd condition.

 The worst part? It wasn’t just about getting married. No, that would’ve been too easy. It had to be for love. No business deal, no marriage of convenience. And the kicker? No divorce for at least three years. Classic him. Always pushing limits.

 So, Connor—brilliant, ruthless Connor—pitched a plan. “Marry your PA,” he said. “Fabricate a love story. You’ve known her long enough to sell it. Tell them you’ve been secretly seeing each other. No one will suspect it, and since you two clearly hate each other’s guts, there's no risk of catching feelings and complicating shit.”

 It was a sound plan. Elegant in its simplicity.

 Except... she said no.

 Of course, she said no.

 I downed the rest of my whiskey in one burning gulp. “I know what you’re about to ask. If I hate her so much, why the hell did I hire her?”

 Connor raised a brow but didn’t ask. He already knew.

 “She wasn’t my choice,” I continued bitterly. “My father hired her. Said I needed someone ‘competent’ watching over me.” That was his way of saying he didn’t trust me. I tried firing her the first week, but the contract was ironclad. The only way she could leave was if she quit. And believe me, I’ve tried to break her spirit. Overloaded her with work, gave her impossible deadlines, made her life absolute hell.”

 “She never cracked,” Connor said with a shrug. “She delivers. Every damn time. I’d keep her too.”

 “She’s obedient to a fault,” I muttered. “Quiet. Disciplined. Annoyingly professional. She never talks back—until today. Today she grew a spine. The one day I needed her to say yes, she decides she has standards.”

 “I was wondering when she would.” Connor smirked. “She picked the wrong fucking time, though.”

 “Damn right,” I grumbled.

 Before he could say more, his phone buzzed, and he slid off his barstool. “I gotta take this. Be back in a bit.”

 I nodded, swirling the remaining ice in my glass, lost in thought.

 That’s when I felt it—a hand on my shoulder.

 “Hey, handsome,” came a sultry voice, sugary sweet and painfully fake. I looked up to see a woman with barely enough fabric on her chest to qualify as a top. Her cleavage was practically in my face. “Can I buy you a drink?”

 Normally, I’d say yes. I’d take the distraction, the escape, the body and the night. But tonight wasn’t the night. Tonight, everything felt... wrong.

 “Not interested,” I replied, forcing my voice to stay calm.

 But she didn’t budge.

 “Just one drink, and then maybe—”

 My phone rang, cutting her off. I’ve never been more grateful for an interruption.

 I excused myself without looking back, stepping out into the cool night air as I answered.

 My eyebrows raised at the caller ID. My PA. Interesting.

 I picked up.

 “About your offer this morning…” Her voice was shaky, hesitant. “Were you... were you serious?”

 “Yes.” No hesitation. No need for it.

 “I... I’ll take it then.”

 I could hear the effort behind her words. The quiet surrender. Something must’ve broken her between this morning and now. I didn’t ask. It wasn’t curiosity holding me back—it was restraint. If she was desperate enough to agree, she’d reached her breaking point.

 And I wasn’t cruel enough to dig into that pain.

 “Good,” I said, my tone cool and measured. “We’ll discuss the terms and details tomorrow. At the office.”

 Then I ended the call and slid the phone back into my pocket.

 She said yes.

 This might actually work.

 Or... it might ruin everything.

 But for now, I’ve got a fiancée to make.

Chapter 5

VENUS

My alarm blared, jolting me awake from the uncomfortable position I had fallen asleep in. My neck ached, my back protested, and my mind was already racing.

I lay still for a moment, staring at the cracked ceiling. Did I really agree to this?

The question looped in my head like a broken record. Did I really make the right choice?

I groaned and rubbed my eyes, forcing myself to sit up. I was doing this for Mom. I'd do anything for her. Anything.

Dragging myself out of bed, I went about my morning routine like a zombie. A quick shower, hair pulled into a messy bun, and makeup kept minimal—just enough to look alive. I slipped into a plain white shirt and an ash-grey skirt—one of the few decent outfits I'd managed to afford since I started working at Sinclair Tech. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was clean and presentable.

I checked the clock. Only five minutes left if I wanted to make it on time. Great.

Grabbing a granola bar from the nearly empty kitchen shelf, I rushed to the door. But when I opened it, I came to an abrupt stop. I was blocked by someone.

Billy.

""Bi—Billy?"" I stammered, my heart skipping a beat.

He leaned against the doorframe, arms folded, eyes cold. He owned the casino where my father, Dain, loved to gamble, get drunk, and bury his problems in white powder. This wouldn’t be his first time showing up at our place to collect a debt. And he always made my skin crawl. The way he looked at me? It gave me the creeps.

""Where’s Dain?"" he gruffed, rubbing his scruffy beard.

""I don’t know,"" I replied quickly, stepping slightly back.

""He owes me money.""

That can’t be right. He took all my whole savings yesterday. What the hell did he use it for, then?

""Like I said, I don’t know where he is. I kicked his drunken ass out last night.""

Billy’s eyes narrowed slightly. ""That so?""

""Look, Billy, I have somewhere to be, and I’m already running late.""

He gave me a slow once-over, raising a brow before licking his lips in that disgusting way that made me want to gag.

""One day, Venus,"" he muttered, like a warning—or a promise I wanted nothing to do with—before walking away.

I slammed the door shut and locked it, chest heaving. Disgusting creep.

When I stepped outside and began walking to the main road, a car sped by, splashing a puddle of dirty water all over me.

""Asshole!"" I screamed, but the driver didn’t stop or even glance back.

I looked down at my soaked clothes and groaned. I couldn’t walk into Sinclair Tech looking like this. I didn’t even have anything clean to change into. I hadn’t gotten around to doing my laundry this week.

Frustrated and wet, I went back inside and tore through my closet. Finally, I found an old sweater tucked in the back. It was faded, a little baggy, but dry and warm. It would have to do.

With no time left to mope, I hurried back outside and managed to hail a cab. But of course, traffic was an absolute nightmare. Cars crawled at a snail’s pace, horns blaring like a symphony of doom.

It was almost like the universe was throwing every obstacle at me. One final warning. One last chance to back out of the deal I’d made with the devil.

But I wouldn’t. I couldn’t. This was for Mom. She needed me to do this.

I arrived twenty minutes late. Not the best impression to make on the first day of your fake engagement.

Sinclair Tech’s lobby was intimidating—marble floors, modern furniture, and pristine glass everywhere. The receptionist glanced at me and gave a polite smile. I forced one back and rushed to the elevator.

My heart pounded harder with every floor the elevator climbed. I adjusted my sweater, took a deep breath, and stepped out on the top floor.

The door to the executive conference room was already open.

Connor sat on the far side of the table, sipping coffee like he hadn’t a care in the world. Aaron stood by the window, suit perfectly tailored, arms crossed, exuding power and ice.

He turned when I entered. Our eyes met.

He looked at me, really looked, and something in his expression shifted for a fraction of a second before he masked it behind his usual cool detachment.

""You're late,"" he said, voice low and measured.

I swallowed the lump in my throat. ""Traffic.""

Connor raised a brow. ""Or cold feet?""

""Neither,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ""I said I’d do this, and I meant it.""

Aaron walked slowly toward me, closing the distance until he stood just inches away. I had to tilt my head to look up at him. The scent of his cologne made my stomach twist. It was unfair that a man so infuriating could smell so good.

He didn’t speak. Just stared.

""We'll draft the terms today,"" he said finally. ""You’ll move in by the end of the week. Appearances matter, and if anyone suspects this is fake, we both lose.""

Connor leaned back, amused. ""So romantic already.""

Aaron ignored him. ""We'll set ground rules. You’ll attend dinners, events, whatever’s necessary. I’ll handle the media. You just smile and look like you’re hopelessly in love with me. Think you can manage that?""

I lifted my chin. ""Do I get a say in the rules?""

His lips curved slightly, not quite a smile, more like a smirk. ""We’ll see.""

Connor stood and clapped his hands. ""Well, this should be fun. Shall we get started, lovebirds?""

My heart thundered in my chest as I took a seat across from Aaron.

I was really doing this. Becoming his wife for three years.

All for my mother.

And maybe, just maybe, for something more I hadn’t fully admitted to myself yet.

Chapter 6

AARON

""I told you she’d come around,"" Connor said with a smug grin.

We were in my office, waiting for my PA to arrive so we could finalize the terms of our agreement. Connor owned one of the most prestigious law firms in New York City, and his reputation spoke for itself. There was no one better to represent my company.

""What changed her mind, though?"" he asked, running a hand through his hair.

""Who cares? The point is, she agreed,"" I replied, glancing at my watch. ""She’s late. She’s never late.""

""Maybe she changed her mind again,"" Connor smirked, leaning back in his chair. ""Remembered what an absolute ass you’ve been to her.""

""Don’t you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?"" I groaned, leaning back in my chair.

""Nah,"" he said, unfazed. ""Especially not when I’m right.""

""Shut up,"" I mumbled, checking the time again.

""Relax. It’s probably traffic."" He leaned back further. ""Or maybe she realized you’re not worth the stress.""

""Connor,"" I warned, glaring at him.

He raised his hands in mock surrender.

 ""And would you please, for God’s sake, let me do the talking before you open your mouth and say something that scares her off?""

""Fine. Only because I want this to work.""

Just then, the door opened—and Venus walked in wearing the ugliest sweater I had ever seen.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:

I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is; the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other. I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere)
* 23–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me:

You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

Reply with:

* One thing you’d love to do together on a lazy Sunday
* Where you are right now (city/prefecture in Japan, or US city)
* One question for me

First five thoughtful replies get a 60-second calm voice note (English or Japanese).

I’m patient and only looking for one person.

I'm attempting to make a move and a lifestyle change and D.C. has been recommended to me many times, I grew up in New England so familiar with the East Coast, but I've also lived in Denver, California, and Seattle bkl:

1) is there a thriving Queer PoC community - Not just in the sense that there's a lot of queer folk who live here but how friendly and kind people are to each other, what kind of third spaces they have where you can show up every week and see the same faces. How is it for a queer black man to live?

1.5) Temperment - on a side note I heard D.C. Can be souless at times. I hear that people are kinda up their own ass about who somebody works for, what politicians they know, etc. is this kind of behavior very prevalent?

2) How much is going on? Do all 4 seasons bring events, opportunity and activities.

3) cannabis and coffee scene. I work in both industries and want to know how the job market here is in general but particularly in these fields.

4) fitness- is it a fitness city?

1ppgagv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1ppgagv/old_lady_tannenbaum/,Old Lady Tannenbaum,"“Wow! That one’s huge!” I pointed excitedly across the street at the gigantic tree in our neighbor's backyard. It was even taller than their two-story house. “Let's get one like that!”

“If you plan to chop it down and drag it home yourself, then go for it,” Dad grunted, eyes never leaving the road, one gloved hand resting on the wheel. “I’m more than happy with this one from the tree lot.” 

“Yeah…” I looked over my shoulder at our new Christmas tree, secure in the bed of the pickup. “It’s not as cool, though.”

“Bigger isn’t always better,” Dad replied, parking the truck in our driveway. “Now, help me get ours into the house.”

“Do you think they’d let us help decorate their tree? If I ask nicely?” I asked him as I grabbed hold of the trunk.

“We have our own tree, don’t pester the neighbors.”

My sister hadn’t taken her eyes off the giant tree since I’d pointed it out. Even when she hopped out of the truck, she kept staring across the street, clutching her stuffed panda in a death grip.

“What do you think?” I called to her over my shoulder. “It’d be cool to have a big tree like that, right?”

She scurried over to us, craning her neck towards the neighbor's yard. “I don’t like it,” she announced. “It’s breathing!”

I rolled my eyes. “That’s just the wind, stupid.”

“It is too breathing! And it has a face!”

“Liar. Santa doesn’t give presents to liars-”

“I’m not lying!”

“Kids,” Dad growled. “Enough. Holly, hold the door open while Jack and I carry the tree.”

\*\*\*

“It's gone.” 

“What’s gone?” I asked sleepily, toasty warm under a blanket at the end of the couch, my eyes glued to *Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer*. Holly sat on the other end, nose pressed to the window to stare across the street, breath fogging the glass.

“The big tree,” Holly whispered. “I looked away, and it’s gone.”

“Yeah? Well, maybe it got up and walked away.” I muttered, annoyed. I reached for the remote to turn up the volume.

Holly shivered and sat down abruptly, slumping, so her head wasn’t visible from the window. She pulled my blanket over her, crushing her panda stuffy in her arms. “When’s dad coming home?”

“How should I know?” I shrugged. Our Christmas tree leaned against the wall, still wrapped and bare. Dad had been called into work before we’d had a chance to even get the decorations out of the attic. “Soon, I guess.”

“Jack…?”

“What?”

“They went on vacation.”

I scrunched up my face. “Who?” 

“The people across the street. They left last week, remember?”

“So?”

“So, when did they get a tree?”

“Oh- shut up and watch the movie with me-” I was cut off by a sound like a gunshot, and we were abruptly plunged into darkness. 

“Jack!” Holly shrieked.

“It’s… It’s just the power.” I tried to sound tough, but my heart was pounding in my throat. I pulled back the curtain to peer outside into the pitch darkness. “Looks like it went out through our whole neighborhood.”

“I’m scared,” Holly whined, pulling the blanket over her head. 

Outside, there was the sound of glass breaking. We both froze in place, holding our breath. More breaking glass, and then a muffled scream that stopped mid-cry.

“What’s happening?” Holly asked in a tiny whisper.

“I think it’s a robber.” I hissed, excited. The other kids at school would be so jealous when I told them- they’d only seen robbers on TV! 

“Do we call Dad?”

“No, we should call the police.” I could barely contain my glee. “I’ll get my phone!”

“Don’t leave me-” Holly grabbed my sleeve, “I’m coming too!”

There was the sound of heavy stomping towards the house, snow crunching under massive feet. The ground shook like a small earthquake. Something scraped against the siding, and the silhouette of branches darkened the window, enveloping us in long, jagged shadows.

“Jack!” Holly squeaked. “It’s the tree!”

“Don’t be stu-” I hadn’t even got the words out when the window shattered, sending shards of glass flying. A huge clawed arm, bristling with evergreen needles, swung into the living room, knocking the couch over as Holly leapt out of the way, screaming bloody murder. 

A gnarled, crone-like face- wood-carved and scaly with bark- followed after the arm, baring jagged, wooden teeth. It grabbed both sides of the window frame with twisted wooden fingers, breaking them apart to create a wider opening. 

Sharp needles scratched my face as it reached inside, dragging our Christmas tree to them. I vaulted over the coffee table and grabbed my sister, dragging her by the hand towards the back of the house.

“I told you so!” Holly bleated.

“I’m sorry!” I screamed back, running blindly towards the back door. I was greeted by icy cold winds against my face as I threw myself into the night, my bare feet stinging as I kicked flurries of powdery snow.

We collapsed on our knees in the flowerbed, wheezing for breath and shaking.

Except for the occasional grunt or scrape of bark, the monster had gone quiet.

I peeked around the side of our house to look.

The creature cradled our Christmas tree as if it were a baby, crooning mournfully in a creaky, splintering voice. It occurred to me that if it were to sit on the ground, hugging its knees to its chest, it would look just like a giant fir.

“It doesn’t see us.” I squeezed Holly’s hand. “Let's go.”

“Go where?” Her voice was so tiny I could barely hear it.

“Mrs. Nicholas’s house,” I explained, pulling her along after me. “Dad said to call her if anything happens when he’s not here.”

“I left my panda…”

“He’ll be fine, pandas eat trees, I think… Now come on!”

We scurried from cover to cover like frightened mice, never taking our eyes off the monster. Every footstep or breath sounding too loud in our ears, feet red raw from the cold.

It was when we were only one house away from Mrs. Nicholas’s that I stumbled over something hidden in the snow, knocking both me and Holly onto our stomachs. I sat up in a panic, looking for what tripped me.

Without light, the snow was stained black with dark blood. The body of one of our neighbors lay strewn about in pieces, dismembered. The crushed head that I’d tripped over stared up at me with a twisted, broken mouth gaping in a silent scream.

Without thinking, I shrieked and kicked the head away. It rolled over the curb and bounced onto the slushy street with a wet thud.

The monster's neck splintered as it whipped to face us. With the sound of snapping branches, it lumbered in our direction, sharp, root-like fingers extended. The ground beneath its feet boomed.

“RUN!” Holly shrieked, yanking my sleeve.

It towered above us in an instant, trunk-shaped foot raised to squash us like bugs.

We scrambled behind a nearby woodshed- just as the foot came crashing down, smushing the remains of my neighbor into a bloody jelly.

The creature let out a bellow like the howl of wind.

“It’ll be okay,” I reassured a quietly sobbing Holly, even as I shook from cold and fear. “I don’t think it saw-”

We both screamed and covered our heads as wood cracked and logs scattered in all directions, a large, wooden arm sweeping it all to the side like a wrecking ball. The root-like fingers wrapped around Holly and squeezed, starting to lift her into the air.

“NO! LET HER GO!” Without a second thought, I grabbed the axe that had been abandoned on the cutting block, swinging it wildly. It was rusted and too heavy for me to lift properly, but I didn’t care. I hacked at the monster's arm, screaming obscenities I wouldn’t have dared use before. The monster bellowed, raising its free fist to smash me. Holly was wriggling, the breath being crushed from her lungs.

“OH NO YOU DON’T!” Shouted a voice behind me. A lantern spun through the air, shattering against the monster's shoulder. It screamed as it burst into flames, lighting up like a bonfire. Holly fell to the ground, winded and gulping air.

The monster thrashed and flailed its burning arms, stumbling towards the woods, the scent of a campfire following after.

“Come, dears.” Mrs. Nicholas grabbed us by the hands and pulled us to her car. “Old Lady Tannenbaum won’t hurt you anymore. I saw to that!”

“What was that thing?” I panted.

“A treefolk avenging her fallen children! I lost my husband to her years ago. I knew it was only a matter of time till she showed up again. Looks like she woke up just in time for the holidays!”

Behind us, the woods began to blaze, tortured bellows echoing across the night sky.

The past is calling, but your future is shouting. You may feel a sudden urge to break a repetitive cycle or a ""type"" that no longer serves you. A connection from a distance—perhaps a traveler or someone from a different background—sparks an unexpected flame.

* **Intrigue:** An old secret may surface that actually sets you free.

# Taurus (April 20 – May 20)

Intimacy isn’t just about physical closeness today; it’s about financial and emotional transparency. You and a partner might finally tackle a ""taboo"" topic. For singles, a casual conversation about values could reveal a soulmate-level alignment.

* **Intrigue:** A small, silent gesture will reveal more than a thousand words.

# Gemini (May 21 – June 20)

With four planets opposite your sign, the focus is entirely on ""The Other."" You might find yourself compromising more than usual, but the payoff is a deeper sense of belonging. Don't chase excitement today; chase the person who feels like home.

* **Intrigue:** You’ll see a side of your partner (or crush) you’ve never noticed before.

# Cancer (June 21 – July 22)

Jupiter retrograde in your sign makes you hyper-aware of your own needs. You are teaching others how to love you by setting firm boundaries. A workplace flirtation could take a serious turn, or a shared goal with a partner brings you closer.

* **Intrigue:** Kindness offered with no expectations will return to you by sunset.

# Leo (July 23 – August 22)

Passion is your primary language today. Venus and Mars are supercharging your zone of romance and fun. If you’re single, the ""mistletoe energy"" is real—expect a magnetic encounter. If coupled, it’s time to bring the playfulness back.

* **Intrigue:** A ""karmic"" connection may cross your path in a crowded place.

# Virgo (August 23 – September 22)

You’re done playing the hero. Today, the most romantic thing you can do is admit you’re tired and let someone else take care of you. Honesty about your inner world replaces the need for perfection.

* **Intrigue:** A revelation during a quiet moment at home changes your perspective on ""forever.""

# Libra (September 23 – October 22)

Stop chasing and start attracting. The stars suggest that the more you focus on your own intellectual growth today, the more magnetic you become to others. A deep conversation over coffee could turn into a definitive romantic turning point.

* **Intrigue:** A message from someone you haven't spoken to in months carries a hidden meaning.

# Scorpio (October 23 – November 21)

Intensity is your middle name, but today requires a soft touch. The Moon in your sign enhances your intuition, allowing you to ""read"" your partner’s heart. Avoid power struggles; choose vulnerability instead.

* **Intrigue:** What you think is a loss in love is actually space being cleared for something better.

# Sagittarius (November 22 – December 21)

You are the celestial favorite today with Venus in your sign. You feel a surge of optimism and ""new beginning"" energy. It’s a day for bold declarations and spontaneous dates.

* **Intrigue:** A sudden ""aha!"" moment tells you exactly who is worth your time.

# Capricorn (December 22 – January 19)

Mars has just entered your sign, giving you the courage to pursue what (and who) you truly desire. You’re moving away from ""hoping for the best"" and toward ""making it happen."" Commitment feels less like a weight and more like an achievement.

* **Intrigue:** A private confession will solidify a bond that has been ""unofficial"" for too long.

# Aquarius (January 20 – February 18)

Friendship and love are blurring into one. You might realize a ""just friend"" has been carrying a torch for you, or your partner feels more like your best friend than ever. Look for love in your community or social circles.

* **Intrigue:** A shared dream or ""crazy idea"" is the spark that ignites a new fire.

# Pisces (February 19 – March 20)

Your public life and your private heart are colliding. You might meet someone through a professional event, or a partner shows immense pride in your accomplishments. Trust the ""slow burn"" over the ""flash in the pan.""

* **Intrigue:** Silence will guide you better than a long-winded explanation today.

They're constantly broke even though they make decent money at their job, like they'll blow their entire paycheck on random stuff they don't need and then ask me to cover rent or groceries.



  
Last month they bought a $400 gaming chair when they couldn't even pay their half of utilities and I had to cover it again. I've tried talking to them about budgeting and being more responsible but they just get defensive and say I'm being controlling. Then they spend over $2k on a pound of weed or whatever the right amt is. It was a lot of weed. Like cmon..



  
It's not even about the money itself, it's more about the fact that they seem to have zero impulse control and no consideration for how their spending affects our future together. Like we've talked about moving in together properly and maybe getting engaged someday but how can I plan a life with someone who can't even manage their own finances.



  
I feel like I'm dating a teenager sometimes and it's exhausting having to be the responsible one all the time. My friends think I'm being too harsh and that money problems can be worked out but honestly I'm starting to think this is just who they are as a person. The worst part is they act like it's no big deal when I have to bail them out but then they'll spend money on expensive coffee or takeout the next day. I love them but I can't keep doing this and I don't think they're ever going to change",229,1766027265.0,AmIOverreacting,22,0.98,False
1ppg7m9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFWr4rIndia/comments/1ppg7m9/19f4r_indiaanywhere_looking_for_genuine/,19[F4R] India/Anywhere- Looking for genuine friendships (or maybe something deeper),"



Hey! I’m posting this in the middle of my end-sems (they get over in a day, thank god), so if nothing else, this should tell you I’m both lonely and an absolute nerd. I’ve been buried in notes, case laws, and coffee for days now, and even though college is exciting, it’s also been a bit overwhelming not having people I really connect with yet.

I’d love to meet people who are kind, thoughtful, and open to real conversations the kind where we actually get to know each other, not just exchange dry “hey/hi”s. And who knows, if we connect well, maybe something deeper could grow from it… but no pressure. I’m big on letting things unfold naturally.

A little about me: I’m a law student, so yes, most of my life right now is reading, researching, writing, and pretending I understand everything on the first read (I don’t). Outside academics, I’m obsessed with literature romance, thrillers, anything that makes me feel something or makes my brain spin a little. I love history, psychology, feminism, philosophy, and just understanding why people are the way they are. I love learning through conversations as much as I do through books.

Personality-wise, I’m an ambivert quiet at first, but once I’m comfortable, I get warm, chatty, and very “I remember the tiny details you told me three days ago.” I’m a feminist but also a hopeless romantic. I love independence, but I also love soft, intentional care. Little things matter to me a lot.

I’ve never dated before, mostly because I want something real. I’m not into casual anything. I want friendship first something steady, warm, intentional, and actually meaningful. I’m a “date to marry” person, but I also don’t rush into things. I like slow, genuine connection.

And just to be clear: I don’t reply to one-word intros. If you message me, tell me something about yourself maybe what you’re reading, what your week has been like, what’s been on your mind lately, something real. I want to know you, not just “hey.”

If you’ve read this far, I’d genuinely love to hear from you just maybe forgive me if I reply with a slight delay. End-sems have me hostage right now.

So I built this little web app called Savings Spinner. It's a prize wheel you spin for positive motivational messages, but every spin adds ""time saved"" (assuming your usual gambling rate per hour) and shows how much money you're NOT losing.  
  
Features:

So

* Smooth spinning wheel with fun outcomes like ""Wealth Builder!"" or ""Inner Peace Gained!""
* Tracks time + money saved
* Growth streak counter
* Live savings chart with milestones (e.g., $5 = coffee saved, $50 = meal with loved one)
* Optional journal reflections
* Totally free, no ads, no sign-up. Just bookmark and use when the urge hits

1ppg36x,https://i.redd.it/zey4gz9qiv7g1.jpeg,"A trial photo of Bernard Schreiber, 18, sentenced to death in 1955 for raping and murdering a 17-year-old girl to ""prove his manhood"". Schreiber, then 17 himself, stalked her for 3 days, then attacked her after she spurned his advances. He would be the last juvenile offender to be executed in Ohio.","[Capital Punishment of Children in Ohio: ""They'd Never Send a Boy of Seventeen to the Chair in Ohio, Would They?""](https://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1823&context=akronlawreview)

Bernard Schreiber was born in Monclova in 1937. He had never been in trouble before and was friends with several younger boys. They frequently messed with him since he had only had one date with a girl and was a virgin. So, Schreiber decided to change that. In August 1954, Schreiber and a 12-year-old companion were in Sylvania Township when a 17-year-old school girl whom they did not know, Mary Jolene Freiss, rode past on a bicycle going for the mail. Schreiber immediately took a liking to her. The two boys proceeded to follow the girl for three days, watching her make trips to a mail box. On the third day, Schreiber approached Friess. The girl immediately spurned his advances.

The next day, the two boys hid in some weeds alongside the path taken by Friess. When the girl rode pass, the two ambushed her. The younger boy knocked her off her bicycle by a hit to the head with a club. Friess dizzily fled into the woods, but was struck twice more and knocked unconscious. The younger boy then left the scene. Schreiber then dragged Mary deeper into the woods, tore up her clothes, and raped her. When Mary regained consciousness, Schreiber became worried that she would identify him. He stabbed the girl twice in the chest, killing her. He then went home and ate lunch.

[The girl, Mary Jolene Friess](https://imgur.com/a/photo-of-mary-jolene-friess-Nplrf9O)

[Bernard Schreiber's arrest and confession](https://imgur.com/a/a7ePGVN)

About a week later, the police received a tip from a neighbor, who reported that Schreiber had confessed to his mother, saying, ""I just killed a girl. I stabbed her twice."" Schreiber's mother said she was horrified by her son's confession, but wasn't sure what to do. After initially denying his guilt, Schreiber confessed after failing a lie detector test. Before making his statement, Schreiber took the police to a dump two miles from the scene. There, they found fragments of the girl's eyeglasses. After returning, Schreiber put his feet on the prosecutor's desk, puffed a pipe, and related how he and the younger boy had planned the crime. Sipping a cup of coffee, he talked about how they had stalked her for days.

>""She looked good. We decided to wait for her. I was intrigued and aroused by the way she was dressed in bra and shorts. She had a pretty nice looking shape and that's what got me.""

When confronted by the police, the younger boy cried and denied any involvement in the murder, but admitted to his initial participation.

The police asked Schreiber and the younger boy about unrelated things. Schreiber had aspired to became a Marine after his graduation. He enjoyed reading comic books, mainly about Superman and Captain Marvel, and usually stayed at home. When asked about television programs, he said he liked mysteries, ""especially those which send thrills down my spine like Dragnet."" He said he had no particular hobby, ""but liked to fool around with carpentry and mechanics."" The younger boy, described as small for his age, was called an average student and interested in sports. He'd followed his normal pursuits since the crime.

Schreiber remained at home, watching television and peering through his windows. Sheriff William Hirsch, described Schreiber, who was called ""a religious-minded youth who never missed mass,"" as ""a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."" Schreiber said that he and his accomplice had driven to the scene after the body was discovered. He spent about two hours in the Sheriff's posse, ""just to see how far they were getting with their investigation.""

Schreiber was charged with first degree murder. He was certified to stand trial as an adult and went on trial in January 1955. He waived his right to a jury trial and entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. At his trial, Schreiber said his accomplice was more culpable than he had initially claimed. What really happened, he said, was that the younger boy had told him, ""Go ahead, get it over with."" The boy waited at the road. When Schreiber returned to him 10 minutes later, he asked, ""Are you finished so soon?""

The younger boy had not been charged. Since he had supposedly disassociated himself from the crime by fleeing after knocking Friess unconscious, he could not be held liable as an accomplice to murder or rape. On account for his age, officials had not prosecuted him for assault. He had been released to his mother. At his trial, Schreiber said he'd changed his story after learning that if the younger boy was implicated in the murder, he'd be sent to a reform school until his 21st birthday.

On the stand, the younger boy denied all involvement.

Four psychiatrists testified that Schreiber was sane, but intellectually disabled. They said he had the mentality of an 11-year-old. He was in 11th grade, but was rated at the seventh grade level. Nevertheless, Lucas County prosecutor Harry Friberg pushed for a death sentence. He said Schreiber's age, somewhat impoverished background, and learning difficulties did not warrant leniency given the brutality of the crime.

>""Nevermind, and I mean never, should this man be in a position to commit a similar crime again.""

He noted that Schreiber had used a hunting knife, not a pocket knife.

[Schreiber is sentenced](https://imgur.com/a/yohK9xN)

A three-judge panel deliberated for an hour before finding him guilty of first degree murder and sentencing him to death by electrocution. A plea for a second degree murder conviction or at least an attachment of mercy to a first degree murder conviction were rejected. Schreiber had admitted that he stabbed Friess a second time since he thought he'd missed her heart the first time. Upon hearing the sentence, Schreiber dropped his head and closed his eyes. His mother became hysterical and his two sisters sobbed. Schreiber later said the decision felt ""just like they had shoved a knife in me.""

On June 28, 1955, an appellate court confirmed the verdict in a 2-1 decision. On December 14, 1955, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected his appeal and scheduled his execution for January 13, 1956. On December 30, Governor Frank Lausche delayed the execution to March 15 so that Schreiber could ask for clemency. At a hearing in January, defense attorney Marcus L. Friedman told the Ohio Pardons and Parole Commission that Schreiber had been raised on the edge of poverty and never had a real break in his life. Friedman said clemency would be ""the first and last break he'll ever get.""

>""If he gets one now, he will never get another because he will be in prison the rest of his life.""

It's worth noting that this is false.

Life without parole did not become a sentencing option in Ohio until 1993. Any sentence less than death for Schreiber was virtually guaranteed to result in him being paroled in the 1970s or 1980s. That aside, Friedman noted the presence of other mitigating factors, such as Schreiber's age and learning difficulties. However, the panel was unmoved. On March 15, Schreiber lost his last hope of avoiding execution when Governor Lausche said he would not intervene. After counseling with his cabinet and reviewing the case, he announced, ""Based upon a careful study of the evidence in the case of Bernard Schreiber, I find the facts to be of a nature not warranting my intervention. The decisions respectively of the Common Pleas. Appellate and the Supreme Courts will not be disturbed.""

Schreiber, who was 17 years and 11 months old at the time of the murder, would be the last juvenile offender to be executed in Ohio. When the state reinstated the death penalty in 1981, lawmakers banned it for juveniles, solidifying his morbid historical footnote. Between 1880 and 1956, 19 juvenile offenders had been executed in Ohio, all of them for murder. All but one of them were at least 16 at the time of their crimes.

The exception was 16-year-old Gustave Ohr, who was hanged in 1880 for robbing and murdering a man when he was fifteen. Hanged him were his accomplice, 17-year-old George Mann, and 18-year-old John Sammett, who was 17 when he murdered a 16-year-old boy who'd testified against him in a burglary case. Even in 1880, some had pleaded for mercy on behalf of the three boys, who were also the first juvenile offenders to be executed in the state. Over the next 76 years, judges and juries in Ohio had become increasingly reluctant to condemn anyone that young to death.

Schreiber's near-adulthood contributed to his death sentence. At the trial, the prosecutor perceived and described Schreiber, now 18, as a young man, not a child.

Schreiber received a final visit from his family. His mother, a brother, and a sister came to say goodbye. His last meal consisted of fresh shrimp cocktail, roast prime ribs of beef, french fried potatoes, buttered whole greens, head lettuce with mayonnaise, pumpkin pie with ice cream, hot rolls and butter with strawberry preserves, coffee, milk, and Coca-Cola. A request by Schreiber to be allowed to eat his last meal with a prison buddy was granted. He ate with 26-year-old Benjamin Meyer, who had been convicted of murdering his estranged wife, 26-year-old Velvia Meyer, on February 15, 1954. Meyer had murdered his wife about two months after she initiated divorce proceedings against him. The two had gotten into a heated argument when Velvia refused to withdraw them. It ended with Meyer shooting Velvia, the mother of his five children, three times with a revolver.

At his trial, Meyer had argued that he was only guilty of second degree murder. He said the gun was meant for himself if his wife didn't drop the divorce proceedings.

>""Meyer wants you to believe he did the slaying in an unconscious state as the result of being struck on the head by a club.""

The prosecution said the crime was premeditated, noting that he had fired three shots and had previously spied on his wife. He had also initially lied to the police, saying he only shot his wife after she struck him with a club. In reality, his wife had done nothing. He was really struck by his wife's niece, 17-year-old Delores Sniff, with a hairbrush. Meyer said she had struck first, but couldn't remember much about what had happened. Delores testified that Meyer had arrived to her home uninvited and pushed his way inside. Her mother, Leila Sniff, said Meyer wasn't supposed to be there and that he should call the police, but did nothing. Meyer left the house, but was twice seen by Leila going around the back. Leila told him that her sister would be here soon and to wait at the front porch.

When his wife arrived, Meyer confronted her and pleaded with her to drop her divorce proceedings. She replied that they had tried reconciliation before and it ""wouldn't work."" When Meyer insisted, she said, ""It is out of my hands."" At this, he replied, ""I can do something about it, drew his revolver, and shot her. Delores started hitting Meyer with her hairbrush, but stopped when he turned the gun on her. Meyer did not hurt Delores, but did shoot his wife twice more before fleeing. Assistant prosecutor Phil Henderson said the idea that Meyer was struck first was a ""concocted story"". He asked the jury to feel Delores's broken hairbrush in their hands to judge whether it could've hurt Meyer. Prosecutor Fred Murray also said Meyer had a bad conduct record in the Navy and was defiant against authorities. Six months prior to the murder, he had been fined on a charge of assault and battery filed against his wife.

>""What did he think of them and his wife? The pattern is clear that Benjamin Meyer has no respect for law and order.""

Murray noted that Meyer had bought the gun on the day of the murder: ""Meyer proceeded in cold blood to take his wife's life, and shot twice more to make sure of it.""

Murray dismissed the claim that the gun was for suicide. In regard to a previous suicide attempt by Meyer a month prior to the murder, he described it as a half-hearted attempt intended to guilt-trip his wife into dropping her divorce proceedings and said that Meyer didn't have the guts to kill himself. He also said that Meyer's decision to flee and conceal the weapon indicated his awareness of what was happening.

Meyer was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death after the jury declined to recommend mercy. He was the first person sentenced to death in Hocking County in the 20th century. However, on September 20, 1955, just three days before his scheduled execution, Governor Lausche commuted his sentence to life in prison after a campaign from his parents. Lausche had repeatedly delayed the execution as Meyer's parents pleaded with him to consider their son's circumstances. Lausche gave this explanation for his decision.

>""Through difficulties and misunderstandings in the home, they had been separated on several occasions. During the last separation, he visited wanting her to come back; a further misunderstanding occurred at the end of which he took her like through a gunshot. When they were married on Nov. 23, 1945, he was 16 years and nine months of age and she was 18 years and nine months. Within the first seven years of their marriage, five children were born. At the time of the tragedy, he was 24 years of age and already the father of five children. He was skilled in no trade or craft and started laboring in a factory when he was 16 years old. The task which fell upon him and his wife was extraordinarily heavy. Misunderstandings and bickerings were inevitably to occur. He was not equipped either by age or position of a trade or economic background to assume his huge responsibilities. With the full recognition of the seriousness of the crime and the sorrow he has brought upon the relatives of his deceased wife, in my opinion, the ends of justice will be served by the State of Ohio exacting of him imprisonment for life instead of death by execution.""

Meyer was paroled some time between the late-1970s and mid-1980s.

His younger friend would not be so lucky. Bernard Schreiber, 19, was executed by electrocution at the Ohio State Penitentiary in Columbus on March 15, 1956. He had no last words, but quietly recited the Lord's prayer with two priests as he was strapped into the electric chair.",11,1766026862.0,HistoricalCapsule,1,0.92,False

As the title says, I’m new to Faridabad and moving to Sector 87 in a few weeks. I have been living in Delhi since Sep 2024 but now relocating to be closer to my office.

Need advice with following things as Google has a lot of conflicting info.

1. My apartment is on 4th floor in a 15 storey building. The landlord hasn’t opted for power backup because the cost is Rs. 36/KW. Do I need to opt for an inverter or is it possible to retrofit power backup?

Google says there are no power cuts in Sector 87 but some colleagues say there are occasional power cuts, can some local people let me know how the situation really is?

2. Following up from above question, I’ll have 3 fans, 1 AC, 1 TV, 1 Monitor, 1 Projector, 1 PS5, Lights, 1 Refrigerator and 1 water purifier. Haven’t finalized on water heater yet.

3. As for WiFi, I download games and use Stremio all the time so I’m looking into 300 MBPS connections from Jio and Airtel. Booked both but the Airtel guy called me and said Jio will offer air fiber whereas Airtel will offer wired fiber. So it is best to go with wired right?

4. I’ll be living alone and only know basic things to cook, what is the max amount someone would pay for a cook in Sector 87?

5. I’ve only looked at Agarwal in terms of packing and moving services but are there other safer options? Someone I know recommended No Broker packing and moving services. Any other suggestions are welcome please.

6. Lastly, I’m looking to buy a Sofa, Coffee table, TV cabinet, Double bed frame and mattress. Is it okay to go with Amazon for furniture purchase or are there any local shops which are better? I’m not looking to spend a lot on the furniture though.

Any advice will be of great help!

*“Inside these walls lies your salvation.”*

*- Motto carved in front of St. Asbeel Church*

Jeff was dead.

He’d been inside our shop just minutes before, and then he was a slab of dead meat in the middle of the road. Outside of Nana’s funeral, I’d never been that close to a dead body before. Never seen one splayed out in the street, crimson blood pooling under its broken and disjointed form. Even after they took his body away and scrubbed the square, you could still see the outlines of the stain.

Darcy was quick to point out that, tragic as it was, the Harvest Festival would continue. I was flabbergasted, and any attempt to dissuade her from continuing fell on deaf ears. Hell, anyone I spoke to held the line: the show must go on.

Mom was beside herself. She had been even more removed from these kinds of actions, and the death struck her hard. She left to spend the rest of the day at our house. The thought of doing anything festive made her ill. She mentioned she was considering cutting her trip short. I told her I didn’t blame her.

Jason and I didn’t have that luxury. We needed to keep our minds busy, so we dove into working on the store. My nerves were KFC-level deep-fried. I feared that every noise I heard was something looming in the shadows, looking to harm us or pester us about the church's readiness.

Yet, our options were limited to: 1) give up our future and leave, or 2) go home and wallow. Neither sounded like an improvement on the current situation, so I kept my nose to the grindstone. Idle hands are the devil’s playthings. How my ancient pilgrim forefathers must’ve cheered my industriousness from beyond the grave.

Day turned to night, and the light from the stained glass muted to all black. I flipped on a few lamps and kept restocking. Jason, brave soul that he is, moved to the basement to put some finishing touches on his pet project. Mookie was with him and sleeping, which, good on him for doing so. I didn’t know if I’d ever sleep again.

At around ten, I heard someone on the back stairs. It was Jason, and the look on his face concerned me. His flushed skin and slack jaw contrasted with his wild, wide-open eyes. He waved me over without a word.

“What’s up?” I whispered.

“I have something to show you.”

“That doesn’t sound promising.”

He led me down the squeaky stairs until we were standing inside the former priest’s bedroom. Mookie had woken from his slumber and was pacing in front of a section of cinder block wall. Jason nodded at it.

“He’s been doing this for a while. I check and…and I think there is a hidden room behind this wall,” he said, tapping on the cinder block. It did sound hollow, but what I know about construction could fit inside a teapot with room for cream.

“There wasn’t anything listed on the blueprints when we bought it,” I said.

“I know,” he said. “But Mookie won’t stop meowing. I came over and slapped the wall, and it sounded different. Hollow. Give it a wap.”

I did. It didn’t seem off until I hit another section of the wall and heard the distinction. I glanced at Jason to ask what we should do, but saw that he was already cradling his sledgehammer, Sluggo. I didn’t argue, just scooped up Mookie and took two big steps back.

Jason swung the hammer like Thor, and after several solid hits, the cinder block crumbled. A hole to the unknown had opened right in front of us. I held up my phone to get a view into the void behind the wall. I saw nothing at first.

But then we heard someone say, “Help.”

I stumbled back and nearly introduced my ass to the ground. Jason looked confused, but then he heard the voice too, this time louder, a little less hoarse, and he backed away as well. We shared a look of astonishment.

“Hello,” the weak voice called out again. “Have you come to free me after all these centuries?”

I looked over at Jason and mouthed a string of curse words. Not sure if he got most of what I was saying, but he got the gist. I had about nine million questions to ask, but my brain and mouth couldn’t come to an agreement about which to ask first. Instead, I just whispered, “ptah abuzzbaba.”

“My thoughts exactly.”

“What the hell is that?”

“A man in the wall.”

“Why is there a man in the wall? How is there a man in the wall?”

“I don’t think my brain knows how to process any of this,” Jason said.

Mookie, as curious as his kind are, instantly hopped up onto the hole and peered into the darkness. He meowed, and we heard it echo back. Before I could grab him, he jumped into the room.

“Mookie!” I moved to the hole and peered in without my phone. I couldn’t see a thing at first. Once my eyes adjusted, though, I noticed a figure slumped against the far side of a wall. They were in an ancient jail cell.

From the void, Mookie meowed again, this time more forcefully. It twisted into a growl before evolving into a snarl. He hissed a few times, and I heard him nervously skitter back toward the hole. I just moved my face out of the way just before he came leaping through and bolted up the stairs, hissing as he did.

I glanced over at Jason and swallowed hard. Just what the heck was going on in there? I went back to the cinder block portal and tried to get a better view of whatever had spooked my poor boy. I couldn’t make out much, but I heard someone jostling.

“H-hello?” I said. “Are you okay?” What a stupid thing to ask. Obviously, the person trapped in a jail cell behind a walled-up secret room isn’t okay. “Do you need help?”

“Have you come to free me from them?”

“From who?”

“The Watchers,” he hissed.

Well, that was terrifying. Way worse than raccoons. I turned back to Jason. “You need to break down this wall. I’m gonna go find help.”

“From who? This whole town closes at nine.”

“I dunno. I’m sure Darcy is out on vermin patrol. I’ll call 911, too. But this guy is going to need immediate help,” I said before turning back to the hole. “Sir, just be patient. We’re gonna go grab some help.”

“Beware the Watchers!”

“I’ll try my best,” I said before I scrambled up the stairs, following the trail Mookie Petts had blazed.

I hit the top floor and headed straight for the front door. For the first time since our move to Sky’s End and purchase of the church, I didn’t feel safe. I guess finding a man walled into a hidden room in your basement will do that to a person.

I burst out onto the street and was surprised to find several people walking around. A few of them were huddled together and pointing at the church. A second glance told me they were with the Harvest Festival committee. Their lanyards gleamed in the moonlight.

Rushing over, they ceased their conversation and looked at me with concern. They must’ve thought I was an insane person with how wild I was acting, but they kept their personal feelings behind the mask of politeness. “Thank God you’re out here! There’s someone inside my walls! I need help!”

The group of people shared a look, telepathically decided I was insane or on drugs or both, and then the lead person - Rachel, I think - looked at me with sympathetic eyes and said, “Darling, are you okay?”

“No,” I said. “We just stumbled into some weird shit, and I don’t know what to do or who to turn to.” I patted myself and realized I didn’t have my phone. “Can one of you call the cops? I probably need an ambulance, too.”

“Oh, you won’t be able to get those two boys. They’re on a fishing trip until Harvest Day. Yearly tradition - ‘Trout before Turkey’ they call it,” Rachel said.

“Usually catch the limit, too!” another one of the committee members added, as if I could give a rat’s ass about their fishing prowess.

“Lillian, we should talk,” came a voice I was familiar with from behind me - Darcy. “We should talk with Jason, too.”

“Darcy, I’m not in the right state of mind to worry about the teeny-tiny details about the festival, okay? I just found a man walled up in my bookstore!”

“I know about him. We all do.”

“Jesus Christ, news travels fast in a small town,” I said. “How did you hear already?”

“I’ve known about him. W-we all have.”

“The committee?”

“The entire town,” Darcy said. “Come, let’s go talk to Jason.”

My mouth went Sahara. Gobi, even. Death Valley on a bad day. I felt wrung out, and the lack of liquid struck me dumb. I had questions and wanted to speak, but nothing came from me. Darcy offered her hand, and I took it. The Harvest Festival committee went on planning as if I hadn’t just spun them a magical tale. I heard Rachel mention something about “putting the bonfire near the grand gazebo this year.”

Darcy led me to the store. She was speaking - I saw her mouth moving - but the blood whooshing in my ears drowned it out. Was the whole town in on this oddity? If so, why hadn’t anyone mentioned it to me when I purchased the church? Why was he there at all? How was he alive?

Who the hell was he?

“He’s a demon,” Darcy said once Jason had joined us upstairs. She said it as plainly as a person ordering their favorite coffee at Buzz’s Bean. “He’s been in there since the town’s founding. He’s the reason we founded the town way out in the middle of nowhere. It’s where they caught him.”

“Hold up,” Jason said, as gob-smacked as I’d been. “Is this a Halloween prank or something? Tease the new folks? A hazing for the newest Sky Enders?”

Darcy politely chuckled. “No, no. This is real. Obviously, it’s not something we’re going to put in the tourist brochures, but up to this point, we had no concerns about it. Our problems were walled up in the basement room where Father Gusion lived, and he wasn’t going to spill the beans.”

“You said you caught him,” I started before Darcy cut me off.

“The town founders. I wouldn’t have stood a chance! I can’t even run a mile without stopping for a breather. Chasing and imprisoning a demon? I’m out.”

“Who are they?”

Darcy sighed and leaned on her elbows closer to us. We mirrored her actions. “If I tell you this - all of it - you cannot tell anyone else. It can’t leave this town. If word of this got out into the wider world, well, let’s just say an underprepared Harvest Festival would be the least of our concerns. Do you understand what I’m saying?”

“Yes,” Jason and I said in unison.

Darcy nodded, took a beat, and started. “They’re called the Watchers, the people who tracked and found the demon Ralph.”

“Wait, wait, wait…the demon’s name was Ralph? Like Wiggum or Kramdem?” I said.

“It’s a longer name, but we all refer to him as Ralph. It’s easier than breaking out an ancient multisyllabic Aramaic word.”

“Aramaic? The language Jesus spoke?”

Darcy nodded. “This thing is old and very dangerous. It’s why they built a cell under the church and walled it off. ‘Lo, if the beast’s face sees the heavenly light of the sun, misfortune and ruin will follow.’ It’s scripture. Basically, if Ralph got loose, it’d put everyone in the town at risk.”

Just then, an orange blur came wheeling into the room and jumped up onto the desk. Mookie had returned from wherever he’d run off to. His pupils were huge, and it was clear he was still on guard. I went to pet him, but he scooted away from us.

“Mookie, what’s up?”

He hissed at me. I felt the sting. He hissed at Jason. He hissed at Darcy before darting away from us. I saw his tail disappear down the basement stairs. I wanted to go grab him, but Jason put his hand on my thigh to keep me in my seat. He leaned in close and whispered, “He’ll be okay.”

“What if ‘Ralph’ hurts him?” I said.

“He hasn’t spoken to you, has he?”

“He said to watch out for the Watchers,” I said.

She put her hand to her mouth. “So, you spoke with him?”

“Well, not much. Once you find a man in a cell hidden in your walls, the conversation is limited to ‘oh shit’ and ‘I’ll get help.’”

“Don’t talk to him. Every word out of his poisoned mouth is a lie, but sounds like the truth. That’s his demonic power - he’s trying to convince you to sympathize with him so you’ll release him. It’s so important that you don’t.”

I shook my head. “Darcy, this is a tall ask. You can’t seriously ask me to leave a man locked up in a cage inside the walls of my bookstore.”

“It’s a church,” she said. “And I do. I can call a few people over to help patch up the wall and keep watch until you guys are ready to open up. It’s easier to ignore him if there is someone else there to help keep you on the right path, so to speak.”

“I can put a piece of wood up over the hole and lock the door to the stairs for tonight,” Jason said. “We can discuss having armed guards tomorrow.”

“I’m not a fan of that plan, to be honest,” I said.

“We can talk more about it tomorrow after the shock wears off,” Darcy said, standing. “Please don’t speak to Ralph. Don’t tell anyone else about this. Loose lips sink ships. We’ll be in contact in the morning.”

She got up and left to continue her late-night patrols of a dead, small town. Jason and I sat in silence for about ten minutes. Our brains needed to reboot. Finally, when words found our tongues again, I turned to him and said, “We can’t tell my mom.”

“God, no.”

“And we need to talk to Ralph,” I said.

“Lil, that’s the one thing she said not to do.”

“I don’t trust her. Do you?”

“Well, she came across a little odd.”

“Why was she outside at night? Why are any of the Harvest People out there? How’re none of them bothered by Jeff’s death?”

From the basement, Ralph wailed. We shared a look before we dashed downstairs. Where there had only been a little porthole when I had left for help, Jason had widened the hole large enough for us to walk through. It’d be a tight fit - and a subtle reminder to get back to the gym - but I could squeeze through if the need arose.

I hoped it wouldn’t.

The room was icebox cold, way chillier than anywhere else in the church. It was dark too. Starless night dark. Bottom of the sea dark. Not sure how anyone could ever be in here and not go crazy, demon or no.

Mookie was in here. I could hear him purring but couldn’t see him. I hesitantly pulled out my phone and turned on the flashlight. I spotted him right away, lying next to a row of iron prison bars. A mysterious white hand stroked the top of his orange head.

“Mookie, come!” He didn’t. Cats, man.

“The Watchers got to you, didn’t they?”

“Someone worse - a small-town planning committee,” I said from outside the hidden room.

“Did they tell you a fantastic tale about my origin?” the mysterious voice asked.

“We learned some new information, yes. Your name is Ralph, for one.”

“It is not Ralph,” he said.

“They call you Ralph in these parts.”

“Mookie, come here,” Jason said, adding cat noises to get him moving. Mookie rolled, stood, stretched, and sauntered back toward us. He was gleefully meowing as he did.

“I wouldn’t hurt the creature,” Ralph said. “It is not in my nature.”

“He bites sometimes,” Jason said. The absurdity of warning a literal demon that my house cat may bite it was too much for my brain to take in at once. It broke me. I went for the big question.

“Are you a demon? I mean, how else would a person still be alive in here with no sunlight, no food, no water? I’m assuming those are magical prison bars or something that keeps you in place? You gotta be a demon, right?”

“If you already believe that I am a follower of the Morning Star, would you believe anything I said to refute it?”

“I mean, at this point, I’m game to hear anything.”

“Yeah, we’re kinda through the looking glass here,” Jason added, scooping up Mookie and placing him on his shoulders like a little parrot. The boy loved seeing the world from the top.

“I am not a demon. I am an angel.”

“Huh,” I said before the aneurysm burst in my brain.

“Those who have told you I am a demon have lied.”

Jason laughed because what else can you do? “An angel? From heaven?”

“There is no heaven,” Ralph said.

“Careful with blasphemy,” I added, forgetting myself. Jason elbowed me. I earned that.

“Heaven is not what man imagines it to be - a pleasing palace among the clouds. Heaven is a much more complex and misunderstood place. My time apart has made my heart miss home, and yet I do not yearn for it. There was much discord, warring factions among my kind.”

“It happens all the time with any size group.”

“The Watchers caused the rupture. They corrupted not only man but themselves. Unable to control their urges with the child bearers of your race, and thus brought forth new evils into this world.”

“And the Watchers did this to you?”

“Yes. They tricked me, bound my feet and hands, and left me here. Entombed away from the vision of the true one. Here I have sat for eons awaiting my salvation. Are you my salvation, mortal?”

“Ugh, I sell books. Bookmarks. Coffee. Not sure I’m anyone’s salvation.”

“Can we see you?” Jason asked, blissfully cutting me off.

“You can look, but you won’t truly see. Not the way you’re used to.”

Jason leaned into me and whispered, “This is like talking with a fortune cookie.”

“We’re gonna come in,” I said, surprising even myself.

I shared a look with Jason. He didn’t look thrilled with this development, but like the gentleman he was, he entered the tiny room first. Holding his arm for stability, I crossed the threshold.

The room was freezing. Goosebumps rose immediately. It was small too, a fact made worse by the cell splitting the space in half. In the dim light spilling in from the bookstore, you could see only the faintest shape sitting in the corner. The figure looked small and frail, which would make sense considering where he’d been hiding for eons.

Jason and I both turned on our lights and pointed them at Ralph. He was a lump of naked white flesh sitting in a ball in the corner. When he turned his face to us, his bright red eyes shone back. His pupils constricted in the light. While the red eyes were concerning, what took the cake were the spires sprouting out from the top of his head.

“It’s a demon!” said a voice from the basement stairs. Jason and I spun to see Mom gawping at the creature from the last step.

Mom’s sudden arrival set Mookie off. He hissed, growled, and shot up the stairs in an orange blur. I wasn’t sure what got into him or where he’d go, but it was the least of my concerns at the moment.

Ralph stood, and his body transformed as he did. Gone was the frail wisp of a man (err…demon? Angel?) and in his stead was a muscled beast, horns scraping the well-worn ruts of the cinder block ceiling. He clutched the prison bars in front of him with his catcher-mitt hands. Why he didn’t just rip away the bars was beyond me - God knows he looked like he easily could.

“If you attack me, I shall strike you down,” Ralph said, his voice booming off the walls. “My protector grants me the strength to smite my foes.”

“She’s a sixty-five-year-old woman. I don’t think you have to call God down on her.”

“He’s not calling down God. He’s calling to Satan! Get out of there before he corrupts you both!”

“She is a Watcher,” Ralph said.

“That’s my mom.”

“She deceives you. This is one of the Watchers. A demon come to claim their prize.”

Mom turned to us. “Get out of there! He’s going to ruin you.”

“They are coming for you,” Ralph said to me. “Unlatch the door, and I can protect you.”

I moved my phone over to the cell door. There was a tiny stick jammed in the lock. A single little sprig of some dried-up wood that wouldn’t have kept a toddler out. Mookie could’ve broken it.

“You can’t break that twig of a lock open?”

“No. Only a human can break it.”

“Don’t touch that lock,” Mom said. “You let this beast out, and it’ll kill us all.”

I turned to Jason, who looked as confused as I felt. “What do you think?”

“I…I don’t know,” he said. “Who’s telling the truth?”

“That’s the sixty-four thousand dollar question,” I said. My eyes went back and forth between Mom and Ralph. I felt a pain in the pit of my stomach.

“Lillian, we’ve had our differences over the years, and God knows I was against this purchase, but you have to listen to your mother over a demon.”

“Yes. Yes,” I said. I should believe her. I would. But something was stopping me. A nagging feeling at the base of my skull. A warning from my ancestors that lit up my brain with flashing “caution!” signs.

“Lilian, who are all these people?”

The voice came from the top of the stairs. I stepped out of the room and saw Mom — er, another Mom — standing at the top of the steps. She was still in her pajamas and looked confused. When she saw another version of herself next to me, she let out a surprised yelp and grabbed the banister for support.

Why were there two of my mom? One was bad enough. With everything unfolding the way it had, my head was swimming already. Instead of laps in a pool, though, I think it was trying to cross the English Channel.

I felt lost.

Confused.

Adrift.

“Break the lock, release me, and I will help you,” Ralph said, his voice pleading.

“That woman is one of his tricks,” Basement Mom said.

“I am a lot of things, madam, but a trick isn’t one of them,” Stair Mom responded. “Lillian, use your common sense and free this thing.”

“Why?”

“Because he’s the only thing that can help us!”

“Lies!” Basement Mom said, lovingly placing her hand on my arm. “She’s trying to fool you, dear.”

“Get your hands off my daughter!” Stairs Mom said, rushing down the steps. She slapped Basement Mom’s hand away. “She’s a monster, Lil. This whole town is full of them.”

“How do you know?”

“The library book. I looked it up - there is no Saint Asbeel!” she exclaimed. “Abseel was a demon. They all worship a demon!”

Silence rushed in. I felt my guts double-knot. I held on to Jason to brace myself from collapsing. I tried to speak - wanted to - but for once, nothing came out of me.

The chanting broke the silence.

From outside, you could hear what sounded like the entire town standing outside the church, repeating the exact phrase over and over.

“Through our sacrifice, we shall prosper.”

“They’re coming,” Mom, my real Mom, said. She ran for the cage to break the stick, but Basement Mom shoved her hard in the back. Mom launched forward, smashing her head on the corner of a jagged cinder block. She collapsed to the ground with a sickening thud.

“Mom!” I went down to check on her. Blood was pooling all around her head. I checked for a pulse and found none. “Mom!”

Jason ran for the cage, but as he did, Basement Mom shot out her hand, and a yellow light exploded from her fingertips. It struck Jason in the chest, and he stumbled back, clutching himself. As he fell back, we locked eyes, and he mouthed the word “run.”

I stood on shaky legs. The chanting was louder now - they’d entered the church. I turned to Basement Mom, who was grinning ear to ear. She reached behind her head, dug her nails into her flesh, and yanked hard.

The sickening sound of tearing filled the room. Basement Mom ripped away her own bloody flesh. Gobs of it hitting the ground with wet slaps. Loose hair floating in the dim light. The way she pulled at her skin, I expected to see a skeleton staring at me.

But that’s not who I saw. Instead of the bone white of a skull confronting me, I was face to face with someone who’d been pestering me for days. Darcy.

“W-what?” was all I could compel myself to say.

“Break the stick!” Ralph yelled, but the deafening chanting from the top of the stairs drowned his voice out. I turned back and saw the deadly choir, dressed in black robes with red runes stitched onto their chests, slowly marching toward me.

“You don’t know how lucky you are,” Darcy said in a measured tone. “To witness proof of divine power. A view so few outsiders get to see.”

I tried to run toward Ralph, but dozens of people rushed down the stairs and grabbed my arms and legs. I thrashed and yanked, but the sheer number of hands on me left me immobile. A fly trapped in a spider’s web.

“W-who are you people?”

Darcy laughed - the same stupid and friendly chuckle she used all the time. “We’re not people at all. God calls us mistakes - evil unleashed by Asbeel’s misdeeds. The unholy union of man and angel - a spawn to all that is dire and bleak. We are the children of the dark, my dear, and you are our necessary tribute.”

I turned back to Darcy. “You’re a monster!”

“And you’re just in time to celebrate the harvest,” she whispered in my ear. She cackled as she tapped the middle of my forehead.

Everything went black.



**Harvest Festival Day**

“And the second is called Asbeel: he imparted to the children of the holy angels the evil counsel and led them astray so that they defiled their bodies with the daughters of men.""

\- Book of Enoch: Chapter 69, Verse 5

The smell of kerosene brought me back from the dark. It was all around me. The fumes filled my nostrils and made me see small bright stars in my closed eyes. When my lids finally fluttered open, the first thing I noticed was the orange rays of the rising sun. A new dawn. A fresh start.

I was standing, and when I tried to move, I found that someone had lashed my body to a pole in the middle of the massive bonfire I’d heard the festival planner discussing earlier. At my feet, I saw the lifeless bodies of Jason, Mookie, and Mom.

Oh God, my loving, gentle Jason.

Mookie, my curious, precious boy.

My wonderful, headstrong mother. My foil and my heart.

I’d killed them all. Tears flooded my eyes and washed down my cheeks. My lofty dreams had manifested in our waking nightmare. I offered them hundreds of apologies, hoping that would wake them up. Bring life back to them.

It didn’t.

The church bells chimed. I looked up and noticed the entire town standing around the bonfire, heads lowered in silent prayer. I screamed at them to let me go. Bargained with them. I would keep their secret if they let me leave. Appealed to their humanity, whatever of it might still be in their diseased minds.

I begged for mercy I’d never receive.

As the bells tolled, one by one, the townsfolk finished their prayers and raised their faces to me. I saw them all: Sweet Lou, Chip Hogshead, Rachel, and the rest. Blank faces, all of them. No humanity behind their eyes.

Darcy, their ringleader, stood in front of them. She held a torch above her head, welcoming the morning orange glow with one of her own. She was the only person still with their head bowed in prayer.

“Darcy! Darcy! Please! Not like this, please! Have mercy!”

The church bells ceased ringing.

“Asbeel, we offer you this harvest.”

She tossed the torch onto the kerosene-soaked woodpile. It instantly ignited. The last thing I remember feeling was the bubbling of my skin and the painful screams I let out as the fire consumed me.

“Judy, have you ever heard of Sky’s End?” the eager husband asked his wife.

“What is Sky’s End? Sounds like a video game.”

“It’s a gorgeous small town. Look at these photos,” he said, clicking through the slideshow on the Real Estate page.

“Oh, wow,” she said. “You weren’t kidding. Super pretty. Why are you showing me photos of a small town?”

The husband smiled. “I know you’ve always wanted to open a game store, right? A quirky little place where people can gather and play games and all that stuff?”

“Sure, that’s the dream. But it’s a dream for a reason - we’re broke.”

“Well, I may have been secretly saving money for a little while.”

“What?”

“Enough for a down payment. They have a building for sale. Cheap. Like, dirt cheap. Look.”

A few clicks later, he brought up the building in question. The wife laughed and smiled. “They’re selling their church?”

“Look at the cost, babe. It’s nothing. Practically giving it away. We can swing that.”

“Hmm,” she said. “Maybe we should schedule a showing?”

“I already have,” the husband said. “Rose is the name of the Realtor. Very nice lady. Sounded old as dirt, but that might benefit us.”

The wife beamed. “Is this for real? Are we really considering this?”

“Hell yeah, we are,” the husband said, patting his wife’s hand. “I have a good feeling about this.”",2,1766025820.0,sunheadprime,0,1.0,False

*“Under his watch, we all prosper.”*

*- Sky’s End town slogan*

Mom had insisted on taking us out for breakfast the following morning. There aren’t a ton of choices, so we went with Sweet Lou’s Diner on Main. Sweet Lou was as brassy as a 9th Ward band with sass to spare. She wouldn’t be out of place in a 40s noir movie, which I found charming, but results may vary.

“Hey doll, how goes the ol’ sit-stand-kneel house?” Sweet Lou said, pouring us all mugs of coffee.

“Coming along. Should be ready to go in time for the festival.”

“Thank the big guy,” she said. “So important that the church is up and running by then.”

“It’s a bookstore now,” Mom said. “Ludicrous, I know.”

“Still have the stained glass?” she asked.

“Yep,” Jason said.

“And the spire? The bell?”

I looked down at my watch and pointed outside. As the minute hand spun, the tolling started. “I couldn’t shut the bell off if I tried.”

“Then I still say it’s a church. To be square with you, I’m glad someone is taking care of it again. I don’t wanna tell tales outta school, but Father was a little lax with the upkeep.”

“You don’t say?” Jason said with a knowing smile.

“That St. Asbeel statue had so much debris on its face, I had someone ask me if it was supposed to be Karl Malden.”

“Why did the church go up for sale? I assume people in this town still need to have a place of worship?” Mom asked.

Sweet Lou shrugged. “I heard it was church business, doll. The big religious muckity mucks did some reconfigurin’ and thought St. Mark’s in Silver Pond was big enough for two flocks.”

“Big church muckity mucks?” I said. “How high up are we talking? Mighty thin air near the top.”

“Not the big guy or his son, but maybe his pal with the hat,” Lou said with a smirk. “Just what I heard. I ain’t been to church since I started sinning. You guys know what you want?”

We ordered, and Lou dashed off to get it started. Mom took a sip of the coffee and marveled at how it tasted. She even gave it a little “Mmm” like the commercials.

“Lil, I meant to tell you, I had a strange dream last night.”

“Was it a hamburger eating you?”

“No, dear, nothing as ironic as all that. I was standing outside your church, and I saw a man standing on the roof. He was glowing white and speaking, but I couldn’t understand what he was saying. Then he just disappeared. Isn’t that odd?”

“If he’s a licensed and bonded roofer and he’s affordable, he’s hired. One less thing I have to do,” Jason said, sipping his coffee.

“What do you think it means?”

“I don’t have the foggiest idea. Sometimes, dreams are just dreams.”

“The lesser-known Freud analysis,” I said, doing a horrid German accent. “Dreams are just funny puzzles with no meaning.”

“Well, Doctor, what do you think it means?”

I took a sip of my coffee and gave it a once-over. “Maybe it means God is watching over the bookstore?”

“You mean church, darling.”

“I do, mother, yes. Or maybe Doctor Manhattan shed the blue and paid us a visit in this timeline and the next and the next.”

Mom waved me off. “I don’t have any clue what you’re talking about half the time.”

Jason leaned in between us and nodded at the back corner of the diner. “You noticed that guy watching us the entire time we’ve been in here?”

“Maybe he’s taken by our beauty.”

“I keep catching him looking over. He mumbled something to the table next to him, and they started looking over. He’s not the first guy I’ve seen, either. The whole town seems to be interested in us.”

“I mean, you two are the newest members in a town that seems to be closely knit. They’re probably sizing you all up. Seeing how well you’ll fit in.”

“I thought clique drama all stopped in high school.”

“Lil, high school dynamics never change. There are always in-groups and out-groups. Right now, you’re riding the line.”

“Maybe if we go to the pep rally and they see our school spirit, they’ll accept us as one of them,” I joked.

“Laugh, but a good impression at that festival would go a long way in earning their trust. Small towns are small for a reason - they want it that way. Outsiders bring in outsider ideas.”

“You make us sound like plague rats or Kevin Bacon in Footloose.”

“You the folks that bought the church, right?” said the gossip-monger Jason had spotted. Without us noticing, he’d crept to our table and loomed over us.

The shock of the stranger’s voice caught me, and I nearly choked on my coffee. Jason, who’d been vigilant, took the lead. “We are, yes. Jason, Lilian, and Joan. You are?”

“Chip Hogshead, Hogshead Lumber,” he said, extending his hand. “Been in town since the founding.”

“You don’t look a day over thirty,” I said, finding my composure.

“How you folks finding Sky’s End?”

“Lovely,” I said. “So welcoming.”

“We are, but that’s a secret. Don’t go blabbing to all the city folk and bring them here. Changes the town, ya know?”

“Present company excluded,” Jason said.

“Remains to be seen,” he said, eying us. “You seem like good people, though.”

“They are,” Mom said. “And everyone we’ve met here has been the same.”

“Glad to hear. Hope to see you all at the bonfire. I donated the lumber. Warped dead stock, but it’ll burn. At a certain temperature, everything does, right?” He laughed, and we gave him polite smatterings in return, but the concern between the three of us was visible to anyone with a clue. “Have a good one. Can’t wait to see the church!”

“Bookstore,” I quietly offered.

“Order up,” Sweet Lou said, placing our food down in front of us. We ate most of the meal in silence.

Mom said she wanted to go see the town library and left us for the day. It was fine with me. Jason and I needed to get back to the grindstone at the church. I imagined Darcy somewhere sensing we were behind on our projects and having a mini-embolism. Hell hath no fury like a festival planner scorned.

Jason had taken to building out some of the shelving units, and I was organizing books by genre when I got the feeling that I was being watched again. At first, I assumed it was Mookie waiting for me to glance in his direction so I could feed him, but he was sleeping on a pile of Stephen King books. I turned behind me, toward the front door, and didn’t see anyone standing there.

I shook it off and kept at my task, but the feeling wouldn’t go away. After another excruciating minute of that feeling gnawing at me, I made my way over to Jason and got his read on things. He was knee-deep in attaching panel C to board F when I came over.

“I hate that these adult LEGOs have become the go-to standard for furniture.”

“Diabolical Swedes,” I said. “Hey, do you feel like someone is watching you?”

“I just assumed you were.”

“I glance, but that’s not what I’m talking about. The last two days, I’ve felt like someone has been in here watching me while I work.”

“Darcy has eyes everywhere?”

“I’m sure she does, but that’s not what I’m talking about.”

“I know,” he said, putting down the plank of wood. “I’ve had that feeling too. The way the people at the diner were staring and talking has really stuck with me.”

“Did we make the right call buying this place?”

“I think so. I think your mom was right. We’re the new guy on the job. It takes a bit for the new guy to find their place. We can’t force it.”

I plopped down next to him, picked up an Allen wrench, and twirled it in my fingers. “I just want this awkward stage to be over.”

Jason spoke, but the sound of a stack of books crashing to the ground near the back door shut us up. He glanced, and me and pointed for us to move closer to the source of the noise. He floated across the floor, careful not to make a sound, and I felt my heartbeat tick up.

I crouched and slowly slunk to where he was standing. From our vantage point, we could see that our back door was open. There was a strong wind, and several of the books had flipped open, and the pages turned as if a meth-addled ghost was speed reading.

I saw Jason’s shoulders relax. He turned back to me and whispered, “I think the wind blew the door open. I should replace that latch.”

In the shadowy area about ten feet in front of us, we heard the skittering of sharp nails on the wood floor. Jason ran over and caught sight of something small and furry dashing off deeper into the stacks. “It’s a raccoon!”

“What?” I said. Behind me, I heard the soft TAP TAP TAP of nails on the floor. I turned back and saw several other raccoons scattering away from us. I don’t know what came over me, but I started chasing after them. They moved quickly, but their little paws failed to find purchase on the ground. The last one blew a tire and slid into the bookshelf. As it rolled onto its back and I got a look at its face, I screamed.

There was a person’s face staring back at me.

Raccoon’s body. Human face. All terror.

“The hell?!” I screamed and fell back onto my ass and kicked away from it as hard as I could. My yell was so loud I was afraid I’d shatter the stained glass.

The raccoon flopped back onto its feet and sprinted like a bat out of hell through the maze of bookshelves and out of sight. Jason came running over, helped me off the ground, and tried to make sense of my rambling.

“Lil, Lil, you’re not making any sense. The raccoons were eating a human face?”

“It had a human face!

Jason laughed. I don’t think he was making fun of me. I just don’t think his brain could process that sentence in any logical way. The idea of it was so absurd, and yet, I’d seen it. Once his titters died down, he asked, “Are you sure it didn’t have a mask on? Might have got tangled up with some Halloween decorations before it came in.”

“It had a face. It…it looked familiar.”

“Lil, did you hit your head when you fell or….”

“Jason, I’m serious. I know what I saw.”

The church’s front door burst open. It was Jeff from Jeff’s Market. He looked disheveled. His wet, sweaty hair slicked back behind his ears. His dirty, puddle-brown eyes were manic, and he moved with the grace of someone with two left feet. He stumbled into the store, looked me dead in the eye, and said, “Did you know you had about six raccoons run out of here?”

“Why I screamed, Jeff,” I said, trying to compose myself. It didn’t work. My whole body was still trembling.

“That’s the midnight brood,” he said, glancing to and fro to make sure we were the only ones who heard. “Not sure why they were out already. Not like them at all.”

“What?”

“Those things are everywhere. I’d started tracking them at night.”

“Darcy said you were feeding them,” Jason said.

“That’s what I told her,” he said, closing the door behind him and walking toward us. “But it’s not true. I started noticing their strange behavior when I bought the store about a year ago. They moved in a pack from building to building every night.”

“Looking for food?” Jason asked.

“I’ve never seen them eat. I even left out a cake for them to try. They left it alone.”

“What are they doing?”

“I don’t know, but it’s not natural. I’ve brought it up with the town officials, but they said I’m crazy. Said rural raccoons act differently than the ones I’d seen in the cities growing up.”

“Have you ever…seen one with…umm…a human face?”

Jeff paused and then shook his head. “Never. Why?”

“She was reading one of the new horror books we have in. She’s just joking,” Jason said, coming to my rescue. “You’re new here, too?”

“I was the newest before you,” he said. “Was going to buy this building, actually, and turn it into an event space - JC Hall - then the store came up for sale after Mr. Greggio died. A small-town grocer seemed like less of a headache than an event space. I switched up.”

“Have you noticed the townspeople…?”

“Watching you? Yeah. They do for a while. I think people were mad I didn’t go forward with the event space. Sweet Lou said it wasn’t right that I backed out of the church sale at the last minute. Said it ruined last year’s Harvest Festival. Refused to serve me for three months!”

I had another question or two, but then the door opened again, and Darcy came walking in. She was as put together as I’d ever seen her. Dressed as sharp as a knife blade, with makeup and hair to match. “Howdy! Coming by for the daily drop-in. Looks worse in here than before. The church will be ready, correct?”

Jason stepped up. “Yes, we’re organizing books before shelving them. The mess is required but temporary.”

“You look all glammed up,” I said, checking to see if she was hiding a raccoon tail. My mind was still shaky, but I didn’t want to give up the ghost to Darcy.

Darcy laughed. “I like to get gussied up for the festival. Told Claire at the salon to ‘be bold’! I think it worked! I feel younger!” She noticed Jeff standing there, and her face shifted to disappointment. “Are you the reason the raccoons were just seen running amok in the town square?”

“Not this time,” he said. “But I should get back to the store. It was nice chatting with you two. The place looks great. JC Hall great.”

As soon as he was out of earshot, Darcy sighed. “The nerve to bring up JC Hall in my presence. Nearly ruined the Festival.”

Mookie, freshly awakened from his nap, was curling around my legs. I picked him up and was about to smother him with pets when he locked eyes with Darcy. He howled, shot out his nails, and clawed away from me. He went behind a pile of books, but his attention was solely on Darcy.

“Jesus, Mook! Gotta cut those nails!”

“He’s shy,” Jason said.

“I’m nice,” Darcy said, waggling her fingers at Mookie. “We can be friends.”

He let out a guttural yowl and sprinted for the basement stairs. A second later, he was gone. The silence in the room was deafening.

“Don’t take offense. He hated me for six months at first.” Jason said, adding, “He’s a mama’s boy.”

“Who wouldn’t love such a lovely young woman?” Darcy said. “If you want a refresh before D-Day, tell Franny at ‘Citizen Snips’ I recommended her.”

Darcy turned to leave but stopped in her tracks. The floor under us had started to vibrate. Not an earthquake, but like someone had put speakers under our feet and blasted a ‘90s bass track CD. It rattled books off the shelves. When it stopped, Darcy looked over at us and smiled.

“That was….”

All the windows in the building shot open at once. I let out another scream and shook my head. “There’s something wrong with this place. Something very wrong.”

“Dear, didn’t Rose the realtor tell you about the ghosts?”

“What?” Jason said, dumbstruck.

“Oh, Rose,” Darcy said, shaking her head. “She’s getting on in years. Probably should retire.”

“Darcy, I don’t give a shit about Rose’s future career,” I snapped. “What the hell are you talking about? Ghosts?”

“Yes, well, I don’t want to tell tales out of school, but the whole town knows about the spooks of St. Asbeel. Kinda a local legend. They’re mostly harmless, but seem to get agitated before the Festival.”

“I’m gonna throw up,” I said, finding a chair and taking a seat.

“Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. If it helps, I can call the priest over in Silver Pond to see if he can do anything. Maybe a blessing after the festival?”

“Even before,” Jason said. “That’d be great.”

“I will call him this afternoon,” she said. Darcy glanced at me. I looked green around the gills, and her face puckered into a sympathetic pout. “I’ll leave you be. Feel better, okay? Big day tomorrow!”

As soon as the door closed, I found the garbage can and unloaded my Sweet Lou breakfast. Jason rushed over and held back my hair as I went in for round two. Once I’d purged everything, I looked up, my eyes watery and my face flushed. “Should we sell this place?”

“What? Lil, we’d lose everything. All of our money is invested in this place. I quit my job to dedicate myself to this dream.”

“I know, I know,” I said, spitting out the last remnants of breakfast into the can. “But this is starting to feel wrong. Maybe God is giving us signs to leave?

The church bells began chiming.

“Very subtle, God,” I muttered.

The front door opened, and Mom blew in like the wind. She had a bag slung over her shoulder, stuffed with library books. She glanced around at all the open windows and shook her head. “Are you fumigating?” She stopped when she saw me, sweaty and clutching a garbage can. “Lil, have you been sick?”

“Must’ve been something I ate.”

“It was those pancakes. I didn’t like the look of them. Anyway, I went to the charming little library down the street and started looking up anything I could find on the church’s history. I’d never heard of St. Asbeel. Anthony, Christopher, Michael, Francis  — I’ve heard of them. But Asbeel? Nope. So I grabbed this book,” she said, hauling out a book the size of a Buick. “A Complete Guide to Saints, Angels, and Demons. It seemed very thorough.”

“Does it double as a weapon against demons?” I jokingly asked.

Mom ignored me. “I also wanted to know a bit more about this town. Everyone here seems so intent on keeping up traditions and all that, I assumed there would be a robust selection of historical books to read…but there wasn’t!”

“Where did the rest of those books come from then?” Jason asked, nodding at her full bag.

“Silver Pond’s public library. I asked about Sky’s End, and they told me all about the town and this little church of yours.”

“Bookstore.”

“Turns out, the church higher-ups, whoever they are, did not close this church. They had no idea what I was talking about. Same with the Harvest Festival. They’d never heard of it. Isn’t that odd?”

I shared a glance with Jason, who nodded. “Maybe it’s a close-knit Sky’s End tradition. You heard the lumber guy talk about bringing in city folks.”

“Funny you should bring him up,” she said, pulling out a dusty old tome. “I asked if there was a book about the town’s history, and they gave me this one about all the local towns in the area and their founding. The section on Sky’s End is very thin, but there was a drawing of some of the town’s first inhabitants. Tell me, does this man look familiar?”

She held up a book and pointed to an ancient sketch on yellowed paper. At first, I couldn’t place it, but then it clicked. “That’s the lumber guy,” I said, my jaw open. “Chip Hammers.”

“Hogshead,” Jason said. “Hammers?”

“Cut me some slack. I just yakked,” I said. “But yes, there is a strong family resemblance.”

“I have a theory, but it’s a bit out there,” Mom said. “I don’t think…”

Mom’s theory never saw the light of day. Just outside the church, we heard the screeching of tires followed by a sickening thud and women screaming. We rushed outside and saw a small group of people huddled around a person in the middle of the street.

It was Jeff.

But the small town life isn't everything it's cracked up to be...especially when she makes an unsettling discovery in the basement.

**Two Days Before the Harvest Festival**

*- flier in Sky’s End*



“It’s a church,” Mom said, staring at the stained glass windows of Jesus hanging on the cross. Her narrowed eyes and pursed lips told me she was clearly holding back additional commentary.

“It was a church,” I said. “Now it’s a bookstore. My bookstore.”

“What?”

“I bought it! That was the surprise!”

“I thought it’d be grandchildren. You made it seem like grandchildren, Lillian.”

“In fairness to me, I am increasing the flock.”

“Not funny.”

“Yes, it is,” I said with a smile. “I’m thinking of calling it ‘The Church of the Perpetual To-Read List’.”

“But it’s a church, darling.”

“In a previous life, yes, it was a church. Now it’s a bookstore.”

“Churches don’t have previous lives.”

“I know Christian dogma doesn’t allow reincarnation, but Jesus or his pals never mentioned that buildings can’t start over as something else.”

“I just don’t know who’d buy books from a church, is all.”

“Mom, the best selling book of all time is the Bible. I feel like you’re not understanding the basic premise here.”

“Lillian, I understand the basic premise. I just don’t understand why you picked this place to open a bookstore.”

“It was either this place or Kitty’s Whorehouse, but that place is still in business.”

“Oh, Lillian, please. In front of a house of worship,” she said, walking inside the building.

We were still moving in, so the building was half church, half bookstore, but it still received the full Mom judgment. She walked around, running her fingers over some pews and checking how dirty they were. Admittedly, they were still filthy because I was currently removing them, but the store was coming into shape. I was scheduled to open in two days, so I’d basically been living in the store to get it finished in time.

“So, I’m thinking of having new releases up front, couches where the pews are, the front desk floating in the middle, an entire section over here for romance and romantasy books, and a coffee stand with free mugs with purchase.”

“Don’t give away coffee, dear. It invites a slothful element. And what’s romantasy?”

“Books where fantasy creatures do what typically happens in the back of cars on prom night. Often in graphic detail.”

Mom crinkled her face. “And these kinds of books are popular?”

“The most popular.”

“No wonder the modern world is in the shape it is.”

“Lil, is this the last of the books?” Jason asked, taking off his well-worn Phillies cap and wiping his brow.

“This shipment, yes. But another one is due later today.”

“It never ends,” he said, shaking his head. “Jesus, this humidity is going to kill me.”

“Jason, please don’t blaspheme in the Lord’s house,” I said with a wink.

“I wasn’t blaspheming. I was appealing to a higher power.”

“Are you two quite finished with your little rat-a-tat?”

“We’ve been at this for days. I’m too tired for rats or tats,” Jason said. “What do you think of the place?”

“It has all the charm of a small-town church.”

“What we were going for,” I said, adding, “Praise be.”

“Amen,” Jason said.

“Well, your little jokes aside, I admire what you two are doing here. I’m a big fan of literacy and third places. You’re building quite a nice ‘hangout spot’ for the town, so kudos to you both.”

“Thank you, Mom,” I said. “Seriously, means a lot.”

“I knew you had it in you,” she said. “I didn’t imagine it’d take this long to find it, but better late than never.”

“There it is,” I said with a chuckle. “That’s the mom I love.”

“Did Lil tell you about the basement?” Jason said, changing gears.

“I didn’t know churches had basements,” Mom said. “Though I suppose you need a place to keep the crackers and wine for service.”

“You make it sound like they served hors d’oeuvres.”

“I think that’s where the priests used to live. Tight but cozy.”

“Noisy, too,” I said absentmindedly.

“What?” Mom asked. “How so?”

Jason looked at me, annoyed. I sighed; this was my mistake, and I was going to have to guide us out. “Well, sometimes, when you’re down there, you hear voices.”

“Voices?” Mom said, surprised.

“Voices, breathing, some knocking,” I said. “Could just be the church settling.”

“Or the good Lord making himself present,” Jason added, trying to smooth out my rough road.

“Jason, dear, if the walls are breathing, it’s not God’s work. Try the guy a little south of there,” Mom said, shaking her head. “Did you know about this when you bought the place?”

“Didn’t come up. We have since sacrificed a virgin to appease the gods, and that seems to have worked.”

“Very clever, Lil.”

“We’re making it our horror section,” Jason said. “It’s got the vibe for it. I’ve been working on dressing it up.”

“It’s his pet project,” I said. Just then, my mewing orange tiger-striped cat joined us and gave me the perfect chance to shift gears away from the breathing walls. “Speaking of, here’s Mookie Petts. He’s the grandson you were hoping for, Mom.”

“Lovely.”

“Hey boy, how’re things out in Sky’s End? Busy?”

He meowed, flopped onto his back, and rolled into my feet. I reached down and scritched his belly. He rolled back and forth for a bit before popping up, wrapping himself around my legs, and sprinting off into the church.

“Is it sanitary to have a cat roaming around?”

“Mookie is good people. Plus, he’s got a job. Keep mice and rats out.”

“It remains to be seen if he’s even capable of that,” Jason said. “So far, all I’ve seen him master is sleeping in the sunbeams from the stained glass.”

“He works at his own pace,” I said. “If you’re too hard on him, you’ll give him a complex. Then he’ll be a weird adult.”

“He might even buy a church and turn it into a bookstore,” Mom said with a nod. I laughed. She still had her fastball. “Is the basement ready to be seen?”

“Not just yet. Close though.”

“The body parts we ordered haven’t come in. It is so hard to find a reliable grave robber these days.”

“Jason, I don’t know how you put up with her.”

He hugged me around my waist. “Who doesn’t love a challenge?”

“Hey,” I said, playfully smacking him. “That and you love me.”

“That, and I love her.”

“We all do,” Mom said. “Though some days are harder than others.”

“It builds character, Mom.”

“Knock, knock,” came a sing-songy voice from the front door. We all looked over and saw Darcy, the town mayor, come sauntering inside the church. She was always this chipper, which is probably why she’d been elected six times in a row. That and nobody really wanted to be mayor. In a place as small as Sky’s End, there really wasn’t too much to do. It was the perfect job for someone who needs to stay busy with minor tasks.

“Darcy, how goes the mayoral dealings today?”

“Oh, you know, the fun never stops. Had to remind Jeff at Jeff’s Market not to feed the raccoons at night. I’m afraid he’s domesticating them.”

“I’ve seen so many of them around the church at night, I’m thinking of hiring them as security.”

Darcy sighed. “They’re not even afraid of people anymore. I went out last night to check on some noises I heard behind my shop, and I saw ten of them standing there just waiting for a handout.”

“Those things are disease-ridden,” Mom said. “Ghastly beasts.”

“They’re cute,” I said.

“No, your mother is right. They’re a blight on the city. We’ve worked long and hard to make Sky’s End a picturesque small town, and I won’t have roving gangs of raccoons ruining it.”

“Roving gangs? Is it like West Side Story? Rival raccoon gangs fighting for turf, the love of a pretty young thing, and to sing songs about their favorite dumpsters,” I said.

“You laugh, but when they’re crawling inside this place, eating your books, you’ll want them gone too,” Darcy said. “But I didn’t stop by to talk about the night bandits - not this time, at least - I came to see if you were still on track for the opening date?”

“Ugh, yeah, I think so,” I said, turning to Jason to help confirm.

“We should be good enough to open. Might still have a few odds and ends to finish, but we’re on track.”

“I hired the best contractors,” I said, slapping Jason on the butt.

“Well, that’s great to hear! The Harvest Festival is the premier event on the Sky’s End social calendar. The night walk to St. Asbeel’s Church is a storied tradition handed down from the town’s founders. It’s essential that we keep the tradition going. The town will pillory me if I screw it up. We’ve already promised our sponsors that we would be ready to go. We have to be ready to go.”

“I know it looks dusty in here, but we’re going to be okay.”

She surveyed the construction and shook her head. “Are you sure? I know you’re new to the town, so the importance of this may be lost on you, but….”

“Darcy,” I said, interrupting her nervous breakdown, “if my man says we’re on track, I believe him. We’re golden.”

She turned to Jason. “Are you sure?”

“Positive. It looks worse than it is.”

“My daughter is a lot of things, but a liar isn’t one of them. If she says it’ll be done, it’ll be done.”

“I give you permission to unclench,” I said, touching Darcy’s tensed shoulders.

She must’ve believed us, because her whole body relaxed. She smiled and gave me a small clap. “Sorry to come across as manic, but there are so many people who look forward to this event, and I just want it to be special.”

“And you’re up for re-election, right?” I joked.

She smiled. “Well, that might be a secondary reason, yes. You are a bright one.”

“At least 60 watts,” I said.

“Well, I will leave you to your, uh, cleaning? I look forward to seeing it all done,” she said. She saw the sign for the large romantasy section and squealed in delight. “Oh my! Is this area going to be all romantasy?”

“Yes, ma’am. All the fairy lovin’ fun that’s fit to print.”

She lowered her voice and smiled. “Don’t tell anyone, but that is my favorite genre! So spicy yet so fun!”

“Your secret is safe with me,” I said. “Come by when we officially open, and I’ll let you take the pick of the litter. On the house.”

“I am going to take you up on that offer, dear!” Darcy said, nearly floating out of the building.

As she left, I turned to Jason. “Did I just bribe the mayor?”

“Sounded like it, Lil.”

“I think I just became involved in a political scandal.”

“I’d call you deep throat, but your mother’s nearby,” he whispered.

“Jason, dear, can you help me bring in my things from the car? I’d like to get my room set up before nightfall, and I’d hate to be accosted by roaming raccoons,” she said, apparently not hearing his joke or choosing to ignore it.

I kissed Jason on the forehead, and the two of them left to bring Mom’s stuff into our little house across the street. I watched them go and felt a strange emotion overtake me. Happiness. It felt weird, like putting your tongue on a nine-volt battery.

With everyone gone and Mookie running around doing God knows what, I had a little time to do a walk around the church and take stock of what else I needed to do. It was in these quieter moments that I allowed myself to push aside the joy of ownership and focus on what other chores we’d had to take on.

It was always our dream to open a charming bookshop in a small town. I’ve always been an avid reader, and Jason loves a project. The church coming up for sale wasn’t on our radar, but when we found the ad online - and the low price - we had to jump. Dreams don’t wait for the perfect time to happen - they just do.

It’d been a hectic month. Pulling the rows of church benches and pews was a nightmare, but once they were gone, the true vision of the store took shape. It was quirky and unique, but I found that all the best bookstores were. My favorite from childhood was an old, converted bank. The vaults held different genres. The owners had made a tunnel of books you could walk through. Local artists took up small corner offices where accountants had once toiled and now made something beautiful for all the patrons to see.

I wanted something like that - I found it in St. Asbeel.

The walls were adorned with exquisite stained-glass windows depicting the Stations of the Cross. When the sun reached midday, the store’s floor was bathed in a kaleidoscope of color. Above us was a spire that easily made us the tallest building in Sky’s End with a bell that would chime every hour. The heartbeat of the town. The grounds had flowering bushes, soaring oaks, and a greening copper statue of St. Asbeel himself looking out over the greenery. It was a perfect spot for a picnic or to read a chapter before heading back to work.

We were lucky we found this place.

I was in the former quiet room, née coffee cafe, when I heard the bell to the front door chime. Assuming it was Jason returning, I called out, “Hey, any chance you brought me lunch?” When there wasn’t a response, I turned around to see who had come into my clearly closed store, but didn’t see anyone.

“Jason? You here?”

Nothing. I walked out into the store’s central area and looked around. I didn’t notice anyone else in there, but I felt a presence there. Another energy. Sounds woo-woo, I know, but you know the charged feeling you get when you’re around others. I had that, but apparently I was the only one.

“Mookie, if you figured out how to ring the bell, I swear to God,” I started, but stopped when I heard footsteps heading down the stairs. I knew Jason had been determined to get his horror section into shape, but it was unlike him not to let me know he had come back.

I made my way to the stairs as quietly as mice wrestling on cotton and gave a listen. I didn’t hear any footsteps anymore. Instead, I heard a voice. It wasn’t Jason’s.

It also wasn’t clear, like hearing a radio through a wall. You know someone is talking, but the language is just word-shaped gibberish. Sims speaking to each other - clear as day to them, but leaving their creator guessing what the hell they mean.

I took a hesitant step down and cocked my ears as if I were fine-tuning the radio. Fiddling with the knobs until the static cleared and I could hear a Red Hot Chili Pepper’s song I hated anyway. Another step down toward the basement. Leaning forward, bracing myself on the banister. I could almost make out what they were saying. It was something like —

BOOM!

A book on the shelf behind me fell to the floor with a crash. I gasped as if someone had been choking the life out of me and nearly tumbled down the stairs. I spun around, expecting to see a ghoul rising from the floor, ready to possess me, but instead heard the soft, friendly trill from Mookie. He lay down on the shelf and knocked off two more books.

I caught my breath, laughed, and brought my forehead against his. “You’re so lucky you’re darling because otherwise I’d boot you outside to fight off those gang-affiliated raccoons.”

Once my heart jumped back into my body and started working again, I leaned down to listen for the voices, but heard nothing. I chalked it up to a radio outside and decided just not to think about bell ringing or the footsteps I’d heard. If there were ghosts, let them be welcoming. I can’t have them scaring away sales.",2,1766025628.0,sunheadprime,0,1.0,False

Im just coming here to ask a couple questions as I know everyone’s situation is different so googling isn’t that useful. My main complaint is that I’m not sure what course of action I should take as I need a lot of work done at a young age. I’m 19 and smoke/alcohol/coffee/anything extremely harmful free and maintain all proper hygiene for my mouth. Unfortunately that wasn’t always the case until about a year and a half ago. Thankfully I received insurance  for the first time in around 8 years this october and was able to visit a dentist. I had around 8-10 filings done; I can’t really remember but I could probably go back and look through my insurance claims. I broke 13 and 4 around a couple years back and only the root remain left under the gum line. I have an appointment to remove them and a consultation for implants in January. My main dilemma is that I need around 8 root canals. 7 of which are on my top teeth-3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14 and 30 on the bottom. All of which have decayed down to pulp exposing nerve and the root canal. None of them are infected thankfully but are very painful and I can really only eat soft foods right now. I know that root canals can be hit or miss but that can be said for any procedure. I just want to go with the option that is going to last me the longest. Price is not really my main concern I really just want to be able to not be in pain and eat normally again. I just don’t really understand the long term pros and cons of each for someone my age. I have an appointment in January to begin root canals starting with 14 but I’m just don’t know if that’s my what I should do. Any opinions, suggestions or anything else will be appreciated :)",1,1766025455.0,askdentists,2,1.0,False

My boyfriend is studying for his cpa so he’s going through coffee like crazy. I was cleaning his machine today and it’s just so old. The brand is Hamilton beach, he mentioned earlier in the year he wanted a machine that doesn’t use blades and instead uses some pressurized version?? I don’t recall the brand he said as he spoke too fast. However now I’m on the search for a machine that is both possibly an expresso machine and a coffee grinder for when he doesn’t want expresso. Is this a thing? (I don’t drink caffeine at all so I’m unsure)

Please send me any links and or redirect me to anything that could help. My budget is most likely 100-200 open to any ideas as well if it’s not a thing. ",2,1766025447.0,pourover,4,0.75,False

I really want to make my teeth whiter.For context, I grew up having diastema (gaps) sa halos lahat ng pagitan ng upper front teeth ko. And so I had this thought since childhood na why would it matter if my teeth are white e pangit pa rin naman. Kaya hindi naging maganda oral hygiene ko since then.

Then I grew up loving coffee and tea. Then I gave birth. Then I had dental braces.


All these contributed to having very fragile and weak teeth, tapos yellow.

One dentist I visited said she cannot perform whitening on me since my teeth are sensitive.
