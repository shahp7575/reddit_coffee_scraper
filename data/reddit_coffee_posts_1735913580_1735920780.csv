1hspx52,https://www.reddit.com/r/prius/comments/1hspx52/grinding_noise_only_when_driving_help/,Grinding noise only when driving HELP,"Tried to add video but it would not allow. 
Let me explain my situation

I woke up and head to the coffee shop to get a cup, probably 2 miles from my house. As I approach the drive thru line I hear a noise so I roll my window down and I hear a grinding noise. It stops when I stop the car though. I took a video and then put my phone down and got my coffee and headed home. The noise never stopped though. On the drive home I had to put my emergncy lights on and drive slow because I did not know if this was a bad issue or what, but with it being -5 degrees outside I was not trying to pull over and get stuck on the side of the road! I did safely make it home but the noise never stopped. Car is currently parked in my garage and I have an appointment set with a mechanic shop for later this evening, however I am curious if the people of Reddit can help diagnose this issue for me and help determine if I should cut my ties with this vehicle and go find something new, maybe still a Prius, maybe jsut a hybrid, maybe an all electric. Idk. I love the Prius don’t get me wrong. Just a lot of issues. Few months back I had to spend $1200 to fix some rotor issues, still paying the credit card off for that. Help me out people. I would truly appreciate your input and kind words of advice. Thanks 🙏🏻 
And if anyone wants to see this video, dm me Il send it to you! ",1,1735920590.0,prius,1,1.0,False
1hspwzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hspwzd/update_on_the_gemilai_g3006_machine_stopped/,Update on the Gemilai G3006 (Machine stopped turning on),"Made a couple posts about this machine last week. My first impression of it was very good. The machine seemed well built, had great features and a powerful steam wand. I was elated to have it after looking it for a couple months and it was working very well. 

Unfortunately, it died on me this week. After owning it for less than 2 weeks. This week, Tuesday morning, I'm already dressed and ready to head out the door soon and I turn it on. Nothing. I switched power outlets three different times. From the ones built into my coffee bar, to the wall and to my surge protector. Nada. It wouldn't turn on. I contacted Gemilai about this and they requested a video of the machine malfunctioning. Now of course, when I try to demonstrate the issue, the damn machine turned on. Then it didn't. All Gemilai did was run around in circles with me by telling me to ""switch power outlets"" and they kept requesting the video as if taking my word for it wasn't enough. I was tired of their BS, telling me they will escalate the issue to their ""tech team"", whatever that means. No one ever got back to me. I printed the return label, put everything back in the box and I'm getting a full refund. I also finally sent them the video. No one got back to me.

I'm very disappointed about it. An upgrade was already in the works and my first choices were a Gaggia or Breville Bambino +. I gave Gemilai the benefit of the doubt since I had saw pretty decent feedback for the brand and the machine itself, even from sponsored content, someone who was paid and gifted it genuinely recommended it and he sold his after upgrading to something else. In my opinion, not everything made in Chinese factories are pieces of crap. I couldn't find any troubleshooting for this issue and I felt like the only one experiencing it. Maybe with this specific model and the one I received, it's possible. 

Another issue I was experiencing with it was when it was actually turning on, once it finished preheating, the four buttons on the top of the machine would begin rapidly flashing. The manual indicated that this meant the temperature was too high. Why is the temperature too high on a machine I turned on 5 minutes ago? Your question's just as good as mine. To get it to stop, I would run the pump for 10-15 seconds.

Gemilai's general customer service was decent at responding but I just did not have the energy to keep going in circles with them, even after sending them a video of the machine not turning on. And they did not seem willing to send me a replacement. So I'm glad I sent it back and I ordered my first option, the Gaggia Pro E24. I should get it by next week.",1,1735920579.0,espresso,0,0.99,False

1hspwf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hspwf9/suspecting_that_the_guy_m35_with_two_kids_ive_f31/,Suspecting that the guy [M35] with two kids I've [F31] been seeing is lying to me. ,"So, this whole thing is definitely a mess. A mess and a half even. I am still just trying to figure it out if it makes any sense to even continue dating him at this point.

It all began when we met at the gym 4 months ago and instantly hit it off. He was open about being a dad of two kids [F14 & M4] and in the process of seperating from his ex-fiancé of 5 years (broken up for a while but he's still moving out).

Mom of first child apparently left him right after they became parents, stating that she didn't want to be a parent at 19 and would rather party and enjoy her youth. She became a drug-addict and is no longer in the picture because of this. So he raised the first child completely on his own. He's also been working a shitty job in construction for over a decade, just to make ends meet. Kind of sacrificed his life to be a good parent. 

I was smitten by him really quickly, he seemed like a good father and a really caring and kind person. Nothing like my exes. As we began talking more often, I noticed that he was very much under the foot of his ex. She would call him multiple times a day, pestering and complaining about something regarding the kids or household duties. He seemed to become a spineless amoeba during those calls. Later found out that he had kind of began dating her seriously because he had been a single parent so long, and that he overlooked their incompatibility over having someone who was open to sharing parenting duties with the child, as life as a single dad had become incredibly burdensome.

Apparently, after the birth of their boy, the ex was not at all interested in her role as a mother to his teenaged girl and began to bully her and demean her any chance she could. In his words, after the birth of their biological son, she seemed threatened by the teenager somehow and would just reject her completely. He tried keeping peace in their home, organized family therapy but this became a massive issue. Only once they finally broke up did she stop this behavior, presumably because she knew the ""threat"" would be out of the house eventually. 

Our meeting happened at an unfortunate time therefore, and since he wasn't completely out of their shared home I thought I'd take things slow. After two months of dating, I invited him over to my place for coffee and as we were cuddling on the sofa, his ex called him. He then proceeded to lie to her about his whereabouts, and told her he'd be on his way home soon. This bothered me and I asked why he would do this, and he told me that once they broke up she had made him promise her that he wouldn't get into a new relationship before they were moved out of the shared home. And since he was breaking that promise with me, he told me it would only cause troube with their future co-parenting and that it wasn't really worth the little while until he'd get his own apartment.

Because of this stipulation, he would always seat us at the back of cafés and restaurants in order to avoid a friend of hers spotting us out and about. Eventually I would rather have us stay at my place to avoid the strange feeling of being a mistress to a man who is already out of his ex relationship. 

With intimacy I also tried to push us to wait, even though he was very eager for it. I told him it was important for me to have sex only after we could spend the night together, not just a few hours ""secretly"" - but after two months my feelings had become so strong for him that this boundary went right out the window. The point where he told me he loved me and was wondering where I was when he got left alone with his teenager was when I couldn't really take it anymore. I felt like he was the one for me and I at no point even minded him having kids since I am still on the fence about getting my own. I figured being a step-parent would be the best of both worlds. 

There was one point that began to make me feel incredibly weird about it all though. As he told me a story about how his toddler son climbed into their bed after having a nightmare, I got shell-shocked and asked why he was in bed with his ex? He told me that since he's so tall (he really is a tower of a man) he doesn't fit on the sofa, and since his job in construction is so rough on his back, a crappy mattress wouldn't do. Also apparently their toddler son has his bed in their room because he struggles with frequent nightmares. So this is ""easier"" for everyone. Except me. 

After four months, I've noticed that I get maybe 2-6 hours of secret time with him after the gym and in general he doesn't text me at all telling me how he misses me or wants to meet soon etc. Could be he's busy with organizing his move or parenting duties but still I feel like I've become a shell of my old self, living on fumes and wishing that next time we see us at the gym he has time to pop by for an hour or two. And even then, our time together has really just become having sex, cuddling and then me crying about how much I miss him all the time. 

I feel like I've had no honeymoon, and I'm so weirded out that a man whose told me he loves me and can't wait to build a future with me (meanwhile I'm a complete nobody in his life and everyone in mine knows all about him) could spend so much of his days out of a week without even texting or calling, trying to see me every day even if just for a short little while before going home after work? I am starting to suspect that he may still be intimate or emotionally intimate with his ex. I've been dying without him, waiting and becoming so depressed because I'm not able to hold him and see him. I cannot imagine that him being a busy dad takes his mind so much off me that his love for me has no need to spend at least some time of the week together holding me and loving on me. I know he hasn't been single for a long time but he made it seem like he was over the relationship for a long time, and that the things that he is sad about missing is their family unit and how it functioned so effortlessly. Being a single dad seemed like a rough time for him. 

What could a future with this guy even look like when I'm starting the whole thing by being a secret to his family and ex?

TL;DR

Man I've been dating for 4 months has kept me a secret from his ex-fiancé because he promised he wouldn't move on until they fully separated. They still share a house and have two children in the mix. Even though she initiated the breakup well over 6 months ago, he's been hiding me out of courtesy to her for four months now. I feel like I've completely missed out on a blossoming honeymoon phase and I'm left on emotional standby until he is ready to date me (which has no clear date at the moment). I feel like I was lead to believe he was more over the relationship until he'd found a new apartment, and is now somehow grieving the loss of his family while I'm left not being emotionally cared for at all between his parental duties and delegating the separation. He told me he loved me but I feel more like I'm a convenience for his future instead of actually being invested in getting to know me and loving on me consistently.

my dad is sweet and loving and somehow the worst person at the same time. yes, he treats my mother nicely sometimes, but at other times he’s horrible to her because he’s an alcoholic. 

once he broke her toes because he was angry at her and threw something at her. she’s had me take photos of her bruises when i was at a young age. i was only 8 asking for them to divorce, instead they gave me a younger brother and said they would stay together for the kids. literally just two days ago he threw a coffee table at her after drinking (he says he’s getting help, that he’s in therapy: it’s clearly not working) 

it’s not as if he’s only hurting her. he’s tried to choke me out twice before, only when i kicked him off me did he stop but smacked me for kicking him. he’s threatened all of our lives multiple times—empty threats, but still hurts. he’s hurled every word in the book at us. 

it’s not like my mom is the best person in the world (she’s kicked me on the floor repeatedly for not eating fruits before once lol) but still, i just wish that she would listen to me and divorce him. but they always make up the next day, my mom forgives him after he apologizes and kisses her, and we move on like it’s a routine.

We have both traveled around and loved spending holidays in Colorado but the cost of living and job market seems scary.  We are looking for much cooler temperatures preferably with 4 seasons. We love spending time outdoors and visiting national parks and being out in nature. We play pickleball, like to go to coffee shops, go to antique stores, museums, zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens, concert venues, jazz shows and much more. We have a dog and two cats. 

I work in environmental consulting and he works in cyber. We debated moving out west but find the cost of living is a hard pill to swallow. We are both pretty new into our careers and one of my biggest concerns is living below/within our means to allow us to save money, travel, and buy a home one day. Being from Texas, we also haven't really experienced harsh winters (except the snowmagedan a few years ago) so that's something else to consider. That would definitely be a learning curve. 

Given the cost of living, we've been trying to set our sights towards possible the east coast and it seems like we might be able to live somewhere that meets a lot of our needs/wants. It's just difficult to look at maps and start doing research without much of a direction.

1hspv5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hspv5q/i_bought_a_beach_house_in_a_small_coastal_town/,"I bought a beach house in a small coastal town. Every night, our neighbors go for a swim in the freezing ocean.","My wife and I recently moved to a beach house located on the rugged Pacific Northwest coastline. The cottage with yellow shutters opened out onto sand dunes leading to the ocean. We were surrounded by neighboring cottages each with the same yellow shutters. 

We went on our first early morning dog walk with Barry along the oceanfront. It was a misty morning, and the waves lapped up onto the beach. It was perfect, a far cry from dog walks in small parks. We passed several dog walkers weaving in and out of the surf. I noticed that they were all barefoot. I slipped off my shoes and socks. I craved to feel the sand beneath my feet. I instantly felt the cold from the wet sand. A wave brushed over my feet. I grimaced. The water was freezing.

Alice looked at me. ""Are you okay?"" I faked a smile. ""Just a bit chilly.""

We continued walking along the shoreline and passed several more barefoot dog walkers. My legs were numb, but I was too embarrassed to let on. I thought to myself, how are they able to withstand the cold?

My wife looked at me again. ""Are you sure you're okay?"" The pain was now unbearable. ""Shall we explore the town?"" I quickly replied.

With my shoes and socks back on, we strolled through the small coastal town. There was a small bait shop and a hardware store, but not much else. My legs were still numb, and I needed to warm up. ""Shall we get something to drink?"" I suggested. ""Where?"" Alice replied.

We walked around for a while looking for a coffee shop but couldn't find one. We passed a middle-aged couple sitting on a bench gazing out at the ocean. 

I stopped and smiled. ""Excuse me, is there a coffee shop nearby?"" They continued to gaze out at the ocean. It was like they were in a trance. ""We've just moved here,"" I added.

Their eyes lit up. The lady pointed to a nearby street. ""Helen's tea room is right around the corner."" ""Thank you,"" I replied. The gentleman chuckled. ""That'll warm your legs up."" I was taken aback by his response. How did he know my legs felt like icicles?

We entered a quaint tea room decorated with nineteenth-century antique furniture. The place was packed with locals sitting together and drinking tea. They stopped talking and stared at us. My wife and I exchanged a look. ""We must look like tourists,"" I quipped.

A mysterious lady in her late seventies wearing a robe greeted us. My wife nervously smiled. ""You have a charming little place."" Helen frowned. ""Sorry, we are fully booked.""

I scanned the room and noticed an empty table in the corner. ""We've just moved here,"" I said. She stared at me. ""One of the cottages along the beach with the yellow shutters."" Helen's eyes lit up. ""Please come this way. Let's warm up those legs.""

Helen poured us a steaming cup of yellowish tea. ""Our special blend,"" she told us. ""Do you get many tourists here?"" Alice asked. ""They leave once it's too cold to swim,"" she replied. Helen left and poured the yellowish tea to another couple.

My wife and I looked at each other and took a sip. The locals watched. The warmth of the tea radiated through my body. I felt a tingling sensation in my legs. The numbness melted away.

Later that evening, I took a lukewarm shower and joined Alice in bed. She was asleep on top of the sheets. I opened the bedroom window slightly to let in the cool ocean breeze. It wasn't a hot night, but it felt humid.

Tossing and turning, I woke up to Barry's loud barking. I looked at my cell phone. It was two am. Barry continued to bark louder and louder. I entered the living room and switched on the lights. Barry was jumping up at the window, barking at something outside.

I tentatively went outside and picked up a beach stone. My heart was pounding through my chest. What if it was an intruder? Anyone could easily access our property via the beach. I saw a light coming from my neighbor's porch. To my surprise, my neighbor was rinsing off in his outdoor shower. I put down the stone and walked over. My neighbor, who was in his early forties, gym fit, wrapped a towel around his waist. He smiled and extended out his hand.

""I'm Jim. You must be our new neighbors."" I stared at him in disbelief. ""Jim, it's two am?"" He casually replied, ""Lovely evening for a dip.""

Surely, he didn't mean the ocean. It's like fifty degrees. You would get hypothermia.

Jim kept smiling. ""You're welcome to join us one night.""

I just stood there. He turned and went back into his beach house. A patch of salt water on his shoulder absorbed into his yellowish skin.

I struggled to go back to sleep. It was too hot, and my mind was racing. Did our crazy neighbor really invite us for a dip in the ocean?  

I woke up the next morning drenched in sweat. I wearily entered the living room and saw Alice outside on the deck in her nightgown, painting the ocean. I joined her. ""How long have you been up?"" I asked. ""I couldn't sleep. It was too muggy,"" she replied.

She began to paint a yellowish figure swimming in the ocean. I stared at the yellow figure.

""That's funny you should paint that. I spoke to our neighbor last night. He'd just got back from his nightly swim in the ocean.""

Alice looked up. ""Some people go Arctic swimming.""

Of course, Alice was right. But the whole encounter still seemed odd.

All day, I couldn't stop thinking about my strange interaction with the neighbor. He seemed so relaxed. Why wasn't he shivering? Why was his skin the same yellowish color as in my wife's painting?

That evening, I waited up. I had to see with my own eyes if my neighbor went for a swim in the ocean. I was getting tired and nodded off in my deck chair. I awoke to voices coming from the ocean.

I crept down to the shoreline. It was pitch black except for a yellowish glow shining off the water. To my utter shock, my neighbors were swimming and bathing in the freezing ocean. Some were diving under the water while others floated on their backs. I crouched behind a sand dune, trying to stay hidden. Jim stood up in the water, and I caught his eye. He smiled and waved for me to join them. I ran as fast as I could back to my beach house. I could hear them splashing in the waves from behind.

I locked the doors and closed the shutters. I was sweating profusely. I thought to myself, this is insane. There is no way I could join them. I wouldn't survive.  

As the weeks passed, we became more settled in. We went on long beach walks with Barry and paddled our feet in the waves. There were still a few tourists around. I remembered thinking, will they ever leave us in peace? We regularly stopped off at Helen's tea room and even bought our own supply of yellow tea.

Every night, my wife and I went down to the shore and watched the neighbors enjoying their nightly swim. I was no longer afraid of the freezing ocean, but despite welcoming smiles from our neighbors, I still wasn't ready to venture in.

One dark winter evening, I joined my wife for a cold shower. The water felt warm on our skin. After we got out of the shower, we were dry almost immediately. I looked in the mirror and saw a yellowish glow radiate through our naked bodies. That night, we couldn't sleep. We were burning up, and our skin was red hot to the touch. Alice and I looked at each other and knew exactly what we needed to do.

In our swimwear, we walked hand in hand through the sand dunes and joined our neighbors in the ocean. Our neighbors smiled at us and carried on swimming. As I submerged into the ocean, the freezing water soothed my flaming skin. I bathed and splashed around. I was in a state of euphoria.  

Over the next several nights, we joined our neighbors in the ocean. It was the highlight of my day. The thought of the ice-cold water hitting my skin and the feeling of truly belonging was intoxicating. It consumed my every waking moment.

One evening, as we prepared for our nightly swim by taking an ice bath and drinking the yellow tea on the deck, we saw a group of young travelers on the beach, sitting around a campfire. My wife and I frowned. How dare they spoil our perfect evening.

As we walked down to the shore, an argument erupted between our neighbors and the travelers. There was lots of swearing back and forth. The neighbors engulfed the travelers and to my shock, dragged them into the ocean. The travelers were screaming and thrashing about as they were held under the freezing water. I ran into the ocean, but it was too late. Everything went silent. The travelers were floating face-down. I desperately tried to pull their lifeless bodies back to the shore, but the tide was too strong. The neighbors bathed and swam like nothing ever happened.

Back at our beach house, my wife and I were panicking. ""We need to call the cops,"" Alice cried. ""It would be our word against the neighbors,"" I exclaimed.

There's no way the cops would believe our nightly swims and our resistance to the freezing ocean. It would be ruled a tragic accident involving drunk tourists.

The next morning, we woke up on the bathroom tiles. We couldn't sleep as we were burning up and needed to take turns going in and out of the shower. I went outside to get some fresh air and saw Jim setting off for his morning run. He smiled at me. How can he possibly smile? Does he even realize that he murdered innocent people last night?

My wife and I decided to clear our heads and take Barry on a long walk. I couldn't help but look at the majestic scenery. The jagged cliffs and the waves crashing against the boulders. There was a brief moment where I forgot about last night. As we walked back, we passed a young family with a five-year-old little girl.

The mother politely asked, ""Is there anywhere that sells ice cream?"" ""It's not summer!"" I abruptly answered.

The mother and father exchanged a look and continued on. Their daughter looked upset. It then dawned on me that I was becoming like my neighbors and that they were in danger. I quickly caught up to them.

""You need to leave!"" The family hurried away from me. I shouted out, ""It's not safe for tourists!""

That evening, we decided to not go for our nightly swim. How could we after what we witnessed? We stayed in our ice bath, but the temperature kept rising, and the water started to boil. We were getting cooked alive and had no choice but to go into the ocean.

""One little swim,"" I said.

We quickly headed down to the shore and entered the ocean. We avoided our neighbors who swam and bathed in what might as well have been the traveler's blood. My wife and I swam for our lives, desperately trying to get the heat off us.

Eventually, we cooled down and swam back to the shore, where we heard a muffled cry. Our neighbors were dragging the young family kicking and screaming from a nearby beach house they were renting.

The neighbors savagely submerged the mother and father. I swam over as fast as I could and tried to fight them off, but they held me back. They were too possessed, their eyes bright yellow.

The little girl was left struggling to stay afloat, her arms and legs no longer able to move in the freezing water. The mother and father stopped fighting and went limp.

With her last gasp, the mother cried out to me, ""Save her!""

The little girl was taken under by a large wave. I dived deep into the water and saw her lifeless body sinking to the seabed. I grabbed her arm and pulled her to the shore. My wife and I carried the unconscious little girl to our beach house. In the background, the neighbors continued to bathe and swim with smiles on their faces.

Back at the beach house, we laid the little girl down on the couch. She had gone blue and was hyperventilating. I wrapped her up in sheets, but she was still unresponsive.

""We need to call 911!"" Alice cried. ""There's no time!"" I replied.

I looked over to the pot of tea on the kitchen counter. I gently poured the tea down her throat. A yellow glow passed through her veins. We waited with bated breath. Her eyes flashed open.

Even after witnessing our neighbor's ritual killings, we could never leave the beach house. We needed our nightly swims to survive. The little girl became our daughter. She was too young to remember what happened, and now that she's older, she even goes swimming in the ocean with her friends.

Every day, my wife and I walk Barry along the oceanfront, and if we see a tourist, we warn them to leave.",1,1735920442.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

-----------------------------------------------------------

Are you looking to enhance the elegance of your space? Black decor can be a game changer. Its rich, deep tones bring a sophisticated touch that other colors may struggle to achieve. When utilized correctly, black decor not only sets a chic atmosphere but also creates a sense of warmth and comfort. Here are several ways that black decor effectively contributes to an elegant ambiance.

### Timeless Sophistication

One of the most striking aspects of black decor is its timeless appeal. Black is a classic choice that never goes out of style. It pairs beautifully with a variety of other colors, allowing for versatile combinations. Here are a few pairings to consider:

- Black and Gold: This combination radiates luxury and glam.
- Black and White: For a clean, modern look, this is unmatched.
- Black and Jewel Tones: Deep greens, purples, and blues stand out against black, creating a rich contrast.

### Creating Depth and Dimension

Black decor can also add depth to your space. When used strategically, black elements can enhance the architectural features within a room. For example, painting a statement wall in black can create visual interest and draw the eye, making the room appear larger and more inviting. Consider incorporating black furniture, such as a sleek coffee table or elegant dining chairs, to ground the space and add sophistication.

### Emphasizing Textures

A notable advantage of incorporating black decor is the way it emphasizes textures. Black allows you to highlight the unique features of your materials. Here are some textures to consider:

- Velvet: Rich and luxurious, velvet in black adds opulence.
- Wood: Black-stained wood can provide a rustic yet elegant touch.
- Metallic: black metal accents can give your space a modern edge.

### Setting the Mood with Lighting

Lighting plays a crucial role when it comes to black decor. The way light interacts with black surfaces can create a stunning effect. Soft, warm lighting will complement black decor, casting a cozy glow that enhances the atmosphere. Consider the following tips:

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
- Use pendant lights with a black finish to provide focused illumination.
- Incorporate table lamps with black shades for a more intimate feel.
- Strategically place candles to create soft shadows and reflections.

### Focal Points

Black can serve as an excellent way to create focal points in your room. Whether it's a bold black piece of art or an eye-catching black accent chair, these elements will guide the eye and spark conversation. For instance, a large black framed mirror can make a small space feel larger while simultaneously enhancing elegance.

### Emotional Impact

Beyond aesthetics, black holds an emotional significance. It conveys power, mystery, and sophistication. Depending on the context, black can also instill a sense of calm or drama. When you introduce black decor into your space, you are not only changing the way it looks but also how it feels. You can create a serene reading nook with a black armchair and soft lighting or set a dramatic tone with dark walls adorned with striking art.

### Balance is Key

While black decor is undeniably fabulous, balance is essential. Too much black can create a heavy atmosphere and may be intimidating. To counteract this, consider the following:

- Mix in lighter colors for contrast.
- Incorporate natural elements like plants to brighten the space.
- Use mirrors to reflect light and create an airy feel.

Black decor is a powerful tool in setting an elegant mood. Its ability to create depth, emphasize textures, and serve as a focal point makes it versatile and impactful. By mixing black with complementary colors and incorporating thoughtful lighting, you can achieve a sophisticated ambiance that reflects your personal style while inviting comfort and warmth into your space. The elegance of black decor is that it not only transforms how a room looks but also how it makes you feel.

Color Psychology: How Black Influences Mood and Perception in Interior Design
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to interior design, color plays a significant role in setting the mood of a space. One color that is often associated with elegance, sophistication, and depth is black. Understanding how black influences mood and perception can help you create an inviting and stylish environment.

### Emotional Connections to Black

Black is much more than just a color; it holds profound emotional and psychological connections. Here’s how black can influence the mood of a space:

- **Elegance:** Black is synonymous with elegance and luxury. Think about the classic little black dress or a sleek black sports car. By incorporating black decor, you make a bold statement that elevates the aesthetic of your room.
- **Introspection:** Black encourages reflection and thoughtfulness. A room with rich black walls or furniture can create a space where you feel both relaxed and inspired, ideal for quiet nights spent reading or meditating.
- **Mystery:** The color black can evoke intrigue and curiosity. It invites exploration and can make interiors feel more intriguing and layered when combined with other colors.
- **Power:** Black is a color that emits strength and authority. When used in office spaces or personal work areas, black decor can enhance focus and motivation, resulting in increased productivity.

### Creating a Harmonious Balance

While black can profoundly influence the mood, balance is key to incorporating it successfully:

- **Contrast with Light Colors:** Pairing black with lighter shades creates a striking contrast. For instance, white walls with black furniture can make the space feel more open and dynamic.
- **Texture Play:** Adding various textures—such as velvet cushions, wooden floors, or metal fixtures—can break the monotony that an all-black scheme might create.
- **Accent Pieces:** Integrate black accessories like vases, artwork, or lamps to create focal points without overwhelming the space.

### Psychological Effects of Black in Different Spaces

The impact of black changes depending on the type of room. Here’s how black can be used effectively in various spaces:

#### Living Rooms

In living rooms, black can provide a cozy yet sophisticated backdrop. Using black furniture or an accent wall can create a warm and inviting atmosphere for social gatherings. Consider adding soft lighting to enhance the elegance while keeping the mood inviting.

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
#### Bedrooms

Black in bedrooms can foster a sense of tranquility and intimacy. Black bedding or curtains create a luxurious feel, while muted lighting can set the perfect mood for relaxation and rest.

#### Offices

In home offices, black can help cultivate focus and professionalism. Whether through a black desk or cabinetry, the rich color can motivate a sense of seriousness, contributing positively to your work ethic.

### Black Accessories That Make a Statement

If you’re hesitant to go all-in with black decor, start with statement accessories:

- **Art Pieces:** Large black-framed art can anchor a wall and draw the eye.
- **Furniture:** A striking black coffee table or chair can serve as a contemporary focal point.
- **Lighting:** Black light fixtures provide an elegant aura while adding depth to your space.

### Challenges and Considerations

While black can evoke elegance, it’s essential to consider a few potential challenges:

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
- **Overwhelming Darkness:** Too much black can make a space feel cramped or gloomy. Ensure adequate lighting is present.
- **Cleaning Maintenance:** Some black surfaces can show dust and smudges; consider easy-to-clean materials.

Black into your interior design can be a transformative decision. Through its emotional connections and aesthetic virtues, black decor can set an elegant mood, making your home a more inviting and sophisticated space. By carefully balancing this powerful color with other elements, you can create a harmonious environment that speaks to the elegance within you.

### Conclusion

Black decor undeniably plays a significant role in crafting an elegant atmosphere within your space. The bold, sophisticated nature of black allows it to serve as a striking backdrop for other colors, highlighting their vibrancy and richness. When used thoughtfully, black elements like furniture, wall paint, or accents can elevate a room, infusing it with a sense of luxury and refinement.

Color psychology tells us that black is often associated with power, authority, and elegance. This influence can transform how you perceive a space and how you feel within it. Dark tones like black can evoke feelings of confidence and sophistication, making your home an inviting environment for both you and your guests. It encourages a serene ambiance that invites deep conversations and quiet reflections.

Black decor also opens the door to various design styles, from contemporary chic to classic elegance. It creates dramatic contrasts, especially when paired with lighter shades or metallics, further enhancing the sophisticated vibe. The adaptability of black ensures it remains a timeless choice in interior design, effortlessly fitting into various themes and personal tastes.

Ultimately, embracing black decor in your home isn’t just about making a bold statement; it’s an opportunity to curate a mood that resonates with elegance and style. By understanding the psychological effects of black and carefully integrating it into your space, you can create an atmosphere that feels both luxurious and inviting, allowing you to savor the beauty of your surroundings every day.

1hsps62,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1hsps62/5_years/,5 Years ,"1/1/2025 marks my five years of no alcohol.

I always hoped I would make it to this milestone, but wasn’t sure if I actually would. I head into this year thankful and confident. In the past year I truly learned what it is to live an honest life and to learn to love myself. 

I’ve had a few moments lately wondering if I could try to have a drink. I think those moments will always come and go. I’m not willing to give up everything I’ve gained to say I can safely consume a certain liquid, which is likely a lie for me anyway. There is no safe amount of alcohol. Who would that be for? To be “normal”? I do this for me and no one else. 

In case anyone just starting is reading, some things that helped me have been focusing on personal growth and mental health, healing childhood trauma, embracing fun in other ways, and having a lot of non alcoholic fun drinks that I like (coffee, tea, electrolyte water, diet pop, etc) 

Also, know that true friends won’t give a damn whether you drink or not. Some fake friends fell off, but even though my best friends still like to party, none of them judged me and they have all been super supportive. 

I’ll always be proud of this accomplishment, but it has become more of an afterthought in my life than a big deal like drinking once was. I think that’s a good thing. ",2,1735920228.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

That he always knew about??,"Sorry if this post has been made already but avi isn't making sense.

Let me explain and remind everyone of statements he said.

1. Chahat is full of herself and arrogant at work
2. Chahat considers herself above everyone
3. Chahat is fake and isn't who she says she is
4. He and chahat were never Close or went out for coffee

After he fought with karan and complained to chahat and flicked his hair for her. Eisha and Alice from afar calling it a romantic scene.
The ladla incident happens.
Avi asks chahat to vote for him and she says no.
He then refuses to give her anything to eat and says give shilpa his food. So shilpa in her own ego trip doesn't eat and funnily enough chahat eats that food.
Chahat throws water on him. Everyone forgets he refused to give her food and conveniently says chahat poked him. But over a no vote he starved her.

5. Chahat panday is a gawar. Because she threw water? He's sucha looser lol

6. He says that she's always been interested in him. And everyone thinks she likes karan but really she wants him and his shirtless body. This is repeated whenever chahat doesn't do something in his favor he says she wants to see
Him shirtless up till the domino task.

7. He claimed she messed a toilet he knew about. 
I am not sure if he means outside but that makes no sense because men's and female toilets are seperate unless they went to each others house.
Mind u this point about chahat being dirty is a whole point stolen from arfeen who accused avi of the same a week ago. But suddenly whole chugly gang is using it against chahat.

8. Edin, and someone else complains about his bathroom habits and they somehow lay the blame on chahat.

9.chahat repeatedly calls him a good person. While he says she's annoying. And he just did his work and went home.

10. On live eisha asks avi did chahat like u outside he says he doesn't know. And then she asks him did u like her he says neVA.

11. Then this last three weeks vivian and eisha kept pointing out that chahat makes paratas when avi asks. Or does work for avi. And teases him that they have chemistry.

12. Avinash repeatedly has asked chahat what kind of groom she wants and been very invested in conversations about her future boyfriend.

13. After her mom scolded him, he said she has a boyfriend outside whose an actor. I watched chahats last two shows he's the only male lead that's been with her mostly LOL who is this boyfriend.

Hence I know some of you saw me say he's the boyfriend. Because what he's saying doesn't make sense.

14. If they never spoke to each other how did she make her bf speak to him.


Now in all of this someone is lying. And changing their story repeatedly.
And his name rhymes with satyanash.

I’m a heavy coffee drinker and don’t eat very healthy so heartburn has been a regular issue.

I also experience a dull ache radiating from my upper to middle abdomen if I sit all day at work, standing and/or talking a walk after eating lunch seems to reduce this sensation. 

Accompanying this has been a similarly chronic and worsening sense of fatigue and at this point my work performance is starting to suffer because I’m so tired all the time.

Abdominal stretches provide temporary relief from tightness symptoms but this has become less effective over time. 

Things I’ve had checked out so far
* Blood tests looked normal, I’m not anemic
* Stool test was negative for H Pylori
* I’m not throwing up, there’s no blood in my stool or pee

I’ve completed a round of omeprazole which seemed to help a little but the tightness/discomfort seems unchanged. 

I’ve cut out coffee entirely since a couple of weeks ago and I’m avoiding fried and spicy foods. This also seems to have helped ease my discomfort a little. 

*Q: I was wondering if I should get a CT scan next, or if an endoscopy makes more sense? I’m nervous about the radiation required for a CT scan. It seems more likely this is gastritis, but I’m worried I could be ignoring symptoms of stomach cancer and I wasn’t sure how best to isolate one from the other.*

My dad has had a western style \~8"" chef knife for nearly 50 years, he bought it in college and still loves it dearly to this day. It is super thin and flexible carbon steel. He sharpens on the bottom of a coffee mug exclusively. It still has pretty good edge geometry, despite losing several MM of blade height over the decades. The tip is highly rounded and the belly is kinda jacked due to this, however, and while I have gifted him 3-4 choice Japanese knives over the years, he is always super appreciate of them, but does not use them. He loves this specific knife, and uses it for literally everything.

HOWEVER, he recently was mentioning how the shape is kinda funky, and said he's open to getting a new one. He said that the Japanese knives I have given him just don't work as well for him as they are too rigid, and he likes to use the knife to scoop up stuff from the cutting board by literally bending the blade along the board surface and scooping stuff onto it (kinda wild technique!).

Does anyone have any suggestions for a flexible chef knife? Fancy steels and shit do not matter at all here, and honestly, probably better to be carbon steel to keep the vibe of the OG (though a Japanese flavor of it could be fun, and would be less of a replacement for the original, just an upgrade).

1hspllt,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftShops_pro/comments/1hspllt/timer/,Timer,"The Importance of Timers in Time Management and Productivity
------------------------------------------------------------

In today's fast-paced world, managing your time effectively is crucial for achieving personal and professional goals. One of the most effective tools to enhance time management and productivity is a timer. Utilizing a timer can help you stay on track, maintain focus, and ultimately achieve more in less time.

When you set a timer, you create a sense of urgency that drives you to complete tasks quickly. This simple yet powerful method encourages you to dedicate your full attention to a specific activity for a limited period. The ticking sound of the timer can spark motivation, preventing distractions that might otherwise derail your progress.

Timers can also be particularly beneficial when it comes to breaking down larger tasks into manageable chunks. By using techniques such as the Pomodoro Technique, you can work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. This method not only helps you maintain your focus but also allows your brain to recharge, which can boost your overall productivity. Here are some reasons why integrating timers into your daily routine can transform your productivity:

- **Improved Focus:** A timer creates a boundary for your work session, prompting you to concentrate solely on the task at hand.
- **Reduced Procrastination:** With a timer set, you're more likely to start a task instead of putting it off. The deadline helps you take action.
- **Enhanced Time Awareness:** Timers help you become more conscious of how long tasks take, allowing you to allocate your time better in the future.
- **Encouragement to Take Breaks:** Setting a timer for breaks ensures that you step away from work periodically, which helps prevent burnout and keeps your mind fresh.

This tool into your routine can lead to significant improvements in how you manage your time. You can use physical timers, timer apps on your phone, or even digital timers on your computer. The vital aspect is to find a method that works best for you. Experiment with different styles to see which keeps you most engaged and productive.

Another crucial element to consider is how to structure your time effectively with timers. It may be helpful to plan your day in advance and allocate specific time blocks for various activities. For instance, if you have multiple tasks to tackle, you might dedicate 30 minutes to reviewing emails, followed by 45 minutes focused on a project, and so on. The outcome is clear—you’ll have a roadmap to follow, making your work feel less overwhelming.

Additionally, using a timer for specific tasks can help you set realistic expectations. Knowing how long it takes to complete a certain type of work allows you to plan future projects more efficiently. This practice will cultivate a better understanding of your productivity patterns and time allocations.

Don't forget to celebrate your victories, big or small. Once a timer goes off, take the time to acknowledge what you accomplished. This positive reinforcement can motivate you to continue using the timer and enhance your time management strategies.

To optimize the effectiveness of timers, consider these tips:

- **Set Clear Goals:** Define what you want to achieve in each time block. Having specific objectives can enhance focus.
- **Limit Distractions:** Before starting your timer, eliminate any distractions that could disrupt your concentration.
- **Adjust Durations:** Experiment with different time lengths for work and breaks to find what keeps you the most productive.
- **Track Your Progress:** Regularly review what you've accomplished during your timer sessions to assess your productivity and make improvements.

In a world filled with distractions, timers stand out as a simple yet effective tool for enhancing time management and boosting productivity. By creating urgency, helping with focus, and allowing for structured breaks, a timer can transform how you approach your work. Whether you're a student, a professional, or someone looking to use their time wisely, integrating a timer into your daily routine could be the change you need to unlock your true potential.

Creative Ways to Use a Timer for Cooking and Baking
---------------------------------------------------

Cooking and baking can be a delightful adventure, but timing is everything. Using a timer effectively can transform your culinary experience. Here are some creative ways to harness the power of a timer in the kitchen.

### 1. Perfectly Poached Eggs

Poaching eggs can be tricky without a precise timing method. Set your timer for about 4 to 5 minutes once the eggs are gently placed in simmering water. This timing helps achieve that ideal runny yolk without overcooking.

### 2. Roasting Vegetables

When roasting vegetables, cut them into even sizes for uniform cooking. A timer can help here too. Set your timer for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the vegetable, and check periodically. This way, you won’t forget about them, and you’ll achieve that delicious caramelization without burning.

### 3. Baking Cookies

For cookies, timing is crucial. After mixing your dough, scoop it onto a baking sheet and set the timer. Most cookies need around 10 to 12 minutes in the oven. Use the timer to get perfectly baked, golden cookies every time!

### 4. Meal Prep and Cooking in Batches

If you’re preparing multiple meals, setting multiple timers can keep you organized. Each dish can have its own timer, ensuring you give attention to each one without getting distracted. This strategy helps streamline your cooking process.

### 5. Counteracting Overcooking

Using a timer is also beneficial to prevent overcooking. For instance, when boiling pasta, set the timer according to the package instructions, typically between 8 to 12 minutes. Once the time is up, check for doneness, and you’ll always have that al dente perfection!

### 6. Timing Your Brews

For coffee and tea enthusiasts, timing is key to achieving the perfect brew. Use a timer to steep your tea for 3 to 5 minutes or to brew coffee for about 4 to 5 minutes, depending on your method. This ensures a balanced flavor without bitterness.

### 7. Fermentation Monitoring

If you're experimenting with fermentation, a timer is invaluable. For homemade yogurt, for instance, set your timer for 6 to 8 hours. This timing is essential for proper fermentation, allowing your yogurt to thicken and develop flavor.

### 8. Cooking Rice and Grains

Rice can be finicky, but with a timer, cooking it becomes easier. Whether you are using a rice cooker or the stove, setting a timer for the recommended cooking time, usually around 18 to 20 minutes, ensures fluffy rice without burning or sticking.

### 9. Mindful Eating Using a Timer

In addition to cooking, a timer can be a tool for mindful eating. Set a timer for 20 minutes during meals to encourage slower eating. This aids digestion and allows you to enjoy your food more fully.

### 10. Creative Baking Techniques

For those who enjoy baking, try using a timer creatively during the process. Set a timer for the first half of baking to monitor the rise of your soufflé or cake. This can help gauge when to rotate the pan for even baking.

### 11. Science Experiments in the Kitchen

Add a pinch of fun by conducting science experiments in the kitchen with your timer. For example, you can investigate how long it takes for different ingredients to combine by setting a timer every minute as you mix components like sugar, butter, and eggs in a cookie batter.

### 12. Keeping Track of Fermenting Foods

When making fermented foods like sauerkraut or kimchi, set your timer for checking them every few days. This helps you keep track of the fermentation process, which can vary based on temperature and ingredients.

### 13. Timing Cleansing Herbs

Cooking with herbs? A timer can help you maximize flavor. Set it for around 5 to 10 minutes when infusing herbs in oils or stews to capture their essence without overpowering the dish.

A timer into your cooking and baking routine enhances your skills and ensures consistent results. Whether you’re timing the cooking of a protein, checking the doneness of vegetables, or sticking to a meal prep schedule, the timer is your friend in the kitchen. So, next time you cook, don’t forget to embrace these creative uses of your timer!

### Conclusion

Mastering the use of a timer can significantly enhance both your time management and productivity. Whether you're juggling work tasks, studying, or organizing daily routines, incorporating a timer helps you maintain focus and structure your day effectively. It acts as a guiding tool, allowing you to prioritize tasks while minimizing distractions. With a reliable timer by your side, you can tackle big projects in manageable chunks, making the process less overwhelming and more rewarding.

When it comes to cooking and baking, a timer becomes even more essential. It not only ensures your dishes are cooked to perfection, but can also spark creativity in the kitchen. From setting precise baking times to experimenting with multiple recipes concurrently, a timer can help you balance flavors and techniques. You can even use it to create fun challenges, like seeing how fast you can chop vegetables or bake a cake within a certain timeframe. These creative approaches not only streamline the cooking process but also turn meal preparation into an enjoyable experience.

Integrating timers into both your work and culinary activities offers a harmonious blend of productivity and creativity. They empower you to use your time wisely, whether you're at your desk or in the kitchen. By harnessing the power of a timer, you can elevate your daily experiences and ensure that you achieve your goals with both efficiency and flair.

I hope this is the right place to post. I went to a bank beach recently with my five year old. While waiting for my appointment at the lounge area, my kid suddenly cried and I noticed her hand was bleeding. I quickly ask the employees for first aid. It was bloody - took several tissues to stop the bleeding then I out a big bandaid on. Turned out, there's a wedge of glass fell off the coffee table with thick glass top and cut her hand when she touched it. It was already broken before but no one fixed it - simply attached to the edge. I told the employees about the coffee table -they removed it right away and filed an incident report. That's it - no offer of anything other than two bandaids. 

Later I saw two more coffeetables in a different area all having the same broken glass issue. I have taken all the pictures.

I was texted out of the blue by a man I connected with via SA many months ago. Like I had forgotten him and everything. He reached out and gave an elaborate story about why he disappeared and how he still wanted to connect with me. 

We chatted for a while, agreed on some terms, and met for coffee and then had our date afterwards. 

He showed me the cash, it was all there, and he put it back in his pocket. At that point I made my first mistake by not taking it and putting it with my belongings. This I’m aware of. 

We had our date and there was intimacy. He pushed my boundaries, to be frank, and I now will be needing to follow up with an std screening in a few weeks. 

We went and got lunch at a restaurant nearby. He then started checking his pockets and realized the cash was no longer there. We checked the room and it wasn’t there either. He believed he had dropped it and the money was lost. He assured me that he was going to be sending the money electronically via Apple Pay that evening but he had to get someone else to send it because he doesn’t have any online payment apps. He said he had to go to his bank (because he said any of the atms nearby wouldn’t give him enough cash for what he needed, he would have to go to his bank’s atm which was a couple hours away). He said he gave the cash to his nephew who will then be depositing it the next day and sending me the money. It has been 48hrs and no money has been sent. He has responded off and on and insists he’s not being deceitful but at this point I am accepting the fact that this was all a ruse. 

I know what my mistakes are in this situation so please, no advice on how I should have handled things. What I need now is advice on how to move forward with possibly finding out who he is, getting law enforcement support, or how I can warn others? I’m at a loss.

1hspg7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hspg7l/the_longest_night/,The Longest Night,"It was an hour past midnight when Alan started to reconsider his life choices. Sure, he'd thought. Go be a police officer, bust some drug-cartels, do some high-speed chases. The kind of stuff he'd always imagined cops did. Instead, here he was, sitting off the shoulder of some god-forsaken highway in the middle of some god-forsaken desert. Reality had a way of stamping out one's expectations, and it had thoroughly done that for him. He spent more time filing paperwork and writing tickets than actually driving his car, and even when something interesting did happen, he was always late to the party. He hadn't even fired his gun yet.

What kind of cop was he that he'd never even shot his gun? He took another sip of coffee. Dull, black and unpleasant. He'd never been much of a coffee guy before, but night shift made it a necessity. Other guys used energy drinks or exercise, but Alan knew that he was too lazy for all of that. The bitter drink worked well enough, but even with the slap in the senses it provided, he still could feel the pang of drowsiness taking hold. Wait in this spot with a speed camera and watch for speeders. All night long, every night. Every single long, uneventful night.

He might catch a few drunk college kids here and there, and that might lighten up the evening, but beyond that, his only company was the darkness of the lonely countryside. The light of a million long dead stars twinkled above the man, while the ever-present crescent moon lorded over the landscape, painting strange shadows across the desert. Cacti and the odd tree seemed to be the only living things for hundreds of miles, save for the pudgy policeman in his cruiser. Every so often, some subterranean inhabitant of the desert underworld might rise from the sand. Usually a lizard or a large spider. Beyond that, Alan felt totally alone.

There was a certain solace in that kind of loneliness. Feelings of insignificance, of ponderings and musings of the nature of things echoed in his mind as he reached a hand forwards to the radio. The knob turned on with a quiet click and soon after the tiny LED screen illuminated with dull orange hues. The smooth tones of guitar and the rattling of drums flooded forth into the small cruiser. A man with a low southern drawl spouted some lyrics about a lost lover or some such. Alan didn't quite pay attention. He really only wanted some sound. Some noise to cut through the overwhelming silence.

It was the kind of silence that seemed to drown out everything. There were no crickets, no cawing nocturnal beasts, only this lonely man in his cruiser, on the side of a desert road. A lonely man with just the recorded sounds of some other, likely equally lonely man to provide him company. Another sip of coffee and Alan felt, in a way, content. Sure it wasn't the worst job in the world. He'd done far worse in his day. It paid the bills, the kids stayed fed, Maureen stayed off his back about the student loans. It wasn't a perfect life, but really, what was?

Sometimes, though, on desolate nights like these, he wondered if he really was happy.

Happiness.

That was a word that meant so little, yet to so many, it meant the world. One had to be happy, had to be satisfied in this life, in order to really live. Did they, though? Alan sat, cranking his chair back as he pondered. Did one really need to be happy in life? Wasn't it enough just to get along? To survive? He sighed. Of course not.

You had to be fulfilled in life, you had to find friends and lovers, you had to pursue your dreams. Then again, did it really all matter in the end? A depressing thought, but he ran with it. In the end, everyone would have to punch the ticket, everyone would wither away and die. Just like everything else. One day, all these cars and road-signs and cacti would be nothing but dust. What then? Why even get out of bed in the morning? As the pudgy policeman continued his internal arguments, trading mental blows in his mind, he barely had time to react when a long convoy of cars came screeching past his cruiser.

Alan practically flopped out of his seat as the convoy passed. A half dozen, then a full dozen, then two dozen military vehicles of all types. Humvees with mounted guns, Stryker APCs, huge trucks with canvased backs filled with men armed to the teeth, eyes glowing under night vision goggles. They watched him as they passed, and even a few gave Alan a passing nod. Above him, a pair of jet-black helicopters armed with twin rocket pods pounded the air with a monotonous drone, vibrating the glass on Alan's cruiser.

Only a few minutes after they passed, Alan saw a blinding light erupt in the distance, like someone had just turned the sun back on in the dead of night. Alan covered his eyes, shouting a string of obscenities as the light faded, replaced with a long, low rumbling. He could feel the car shaking, he could feel his body vibrate like a tuning fork as the ground quivered and quaked. His head pounded. His eyes felt like jelly. For the briefest moment, Alan thought that he would die here, on this lonesome highway, the victim of some terrorist attack or what have you.

Yet, just like that, it was over. The policeman held his head in pain. He could feel bile rising from his stomach. In a flash, he shoved open the cruiser door and doubled over onto the cold pavement. Another moment and he blew chunks, all across the ground and his uniform. That didn't matter as much to him, what mattered was the low, red glow that began to manifest in the distance, further down the highway. With his sleeve, he wiped the vomit from his face. The glow was minimal, but bright enough that he could see it all across the distant horizon. A few mountains blocked most of it from view, but it didn't take him long to realize what exactly it was. It was a fire. A massive, enormous fire.

His instincts kicked in instantly, and the officer dove into his car, shoved it into drive and sped off down the highway. In his mind, he ran through the possibilities. There weren't many towns in that direction. There weren't even that many people living out here. Just the odd rancher or quiet redneck. It didn't make sense. What in god's name had happened?

Just as his mind was beginning to adjust to the sudden change, he slammed the breaks. He couldn't believe what he was seeing. Up ahead, just off the side of the road, were a pair of transport trucks. One was overturned, while the other looked like it had simply pulled off the side of the road. Alan slid the car into park and, clutching his handgun closely, stepped out of the cruiser and back into the cold desert air.

With the fearful steps of some hunted animal, the policeman approached the two cars. He kept the handgun gripped tightly, like some kind of talisman, against his chest. The first truck, pulled over to the side, seemed untouched. He peeked up into the cabin, through the driver-side window, and found that only the passenger door had been left open. Curious, he popped the door open and peeked inside. Nothing, save for a few maps and a pair of sunglasses on the visor. Alan sighed and hopped down.

Just as he did, a cool breeze picked up, and he caught a strange scent on it. The smell of electricity. Like dust burning on a light-bulb. Alan perked up a bit, and slowly made his way around the side of the truck, only to stop dead in his tracks. There, off to the side of the road, was a soldier. What was left of him, at least.

Alan froze. Hands quivering, he slowly stepped forwards, muttering a few swears to himself as he did. He didn't understand, he didn't get it. As he stood over the body, he realized that the smell was coming directly from it. It looked like the man had been microwaved, or baked. His clothes were melted onto his skin, his eyes and hair had disintegrated completely. The corpse sat there, contorted into a position of absolute agony as the policeman ran his hands through his greasy hair, feeling the panic beginning to take hold.

The corpse seemed to hum with some residual energy, and Alan could even feel a bit of heat coming from its blackened exterior. That was enough to turn him back to the car. He'd seen enough, he was done. He was going back to the station to find out what in god's name he'd stumbled into. His eyes had just drifted from the corpse to the car when he stopped, dead in his tracks. Off in the distance beyond the highway, just barely a hundred feet from him, was a man. He stood in a patch of barren desert, just past the second, overturned truck. Alan eyed him closely then, with handgun close once more, he stepped forwards.

The man merely watched him as Alan slowly, methodically made his way to the car. There was something so off, so wrong about the darkened figure that he couldn't quite place. Even still, he had a job to do, and while trying to hide his panicked tone, he called out to the figure. ""Uh, hello? Lincoln County police. Wh-Who's there?"" The figure just stood there, totally still as Alan felt a chill pang up and down his spine as the moonlight reflected off it's jet black eyes.

It wasn't a man.

He threw the car door open, and the figure burst into a full sprint. Alan practically dove inside, and threw the car into reverse. The figure slammed into the driver-side window as it moved, and Alan screamed as he started directly into the creatures face. A massive mouth dominated it, with hundreds, maybe thousands of spiny teeth within, dripping with the blood of it's last victim. The rest of the creature's body was mostly obscured, but Alan made the color of it's eyes and it's body; jet black. As the car continued to reverse, Alan watched as the teeth began to scrape at the window. He shifted, and slammed his foot against the accelerator and the car jolted back down the highway in the opposite direction, flinging the creature back into the abyss of the desert night.

Alan could feel beads of sweat rolling down his forehead, he could feel his heart about to burst out of his chest. Questions filled his mind as he careened down that once-quiet desert highway. That thing wasn't a man. It looked like a man but it wasn't. It was something else. He looked to the clock and his pulsating heart nearly stopped dead.

It was eight in the morning. He'd lost eight hours? How? He'd only been at the convoy for a few minutes!

He checked his watch; eight AM. His phone; eight AM. Everything that could feasibly tell time, he checked, and they all said the same thing.

Eight in the morning. The policeman slammed his hands on the wheel. Horror, revulsion, fear, all flooded through his mind as he pulled over to the side of the road. He nearly ripped the radio out of it's socket and screamed into it.

""This is Officer Alan MacDaniels, Lincoln County police, can anyone hear me?""

Silence was all the response he needed.

He slid back in his seat, flabbergasted and terrified. He barely thought of anything for twenty minutes until, finally, a thought crossed his mind. He could use the sun-

Why wasn't the sun up yet?

Breath caught in his throat as he examined the sky. He was right, as much as he prayed he wasn't. The sun hadn't come up. The moon still sat, glued in the sky like a mocking specter. Alan shook his head. No, this was wrong. This was all wrong. Everything. He shrieked and howled and wept in utter, indescribable panic as he tried every radio frequency he could find. No one responded. Not a single person. He was alone, truly now.

As the tears flowed down his face, he laid it against the dashboard. His children, his wife. Were they trapped too? Was he dead? Alan raised his head once more, and his whole body seemed to stop functioning. Time stopped dead as he looked ahead to see the same two trucks he had sped so quickly away from.

Two trucks that had to have been ten miles behind him by the time he stopped. One overturned. One still intact. A charred body. A man, that was not a man. It was as if he was caught in some kind of nightmarish groundhog day.

The creatures gaze caught Alan's, and it started to approach his cruiser once more. Alan could only cry as it skulked ever closer, seemingly taking its time to torture the poor man. As it did, even more of these things emerged with it from the brush on either side of the road. Their eyes all locking with Alan's gaze.

In unison, they arrived at his car, and pressed their spindly fingers against the windows, tapping as if to taunt their prey before consuming it.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Their thousands of white fangs scraped against the window like nails down a chalkboard.

Alan closed his eyes, and began to scream into the hopeless nothingness.

1hspfgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hspfgl/21_day_caffeine_free_small_question/,21 day caffeine free - small question ,"Hi there,

Currently on my first 21 day complete caffeine free. No tea, no chocolate, no coffee nothing.

I used to drink 1 espresso a day.

I am not quite sure about the benefits yet. Hope to see some next coming week / weeks.

But I do have a question, I am living in the centre of a big city. Whenever I go on a walk through my neighborhood I pass like tens of coffee / breakfast bars. Normally I used to take one espresso during my walk. 

And I do miss it really bad right now. I still do a daily walk and every day I am struggling haha. I don’t like a fresh mint tea or whatsoever. And I am not quite sure what to replace my one espresso with. Ofcourse without consuming caffeine. 

Any tips?

Basically, I just started working at a new shop and let's just say the par is not where the par tends to be at most other shops, including ones i've worked at. I've been a barista for about 4 years now and my employer and coworkers are aware of my experience, I'm also the only person in the building that can do latte art or rather steam milk properly. 

They aren't really cleaning the machines properly or consistently, and I'm trying to bring about some consistency to that but i don't close every night. The grinders, drip brew, entire espresso machine, you name it they don't really clean it.

To convince them to change their ways, what are other reasons we should really be doing all this cleaning every day or at least more consistently (other than tasting old coffee)? Thanks!",3,1735919264.0,barista,0,1.0,False
1hspehk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nobuy/comments/1hspehk/animal_expenses/,Animal Expenses ,"I caved in and I decided to pay for a day of daycare for my crazy Labradoodle puppy that's about 7 months old right now. It's about $30 for a full day, which is 5+ hours I think. 

I am currently working from home, studying for my insurance license exam that's scheduled for Tuesday, and I need a quiet environment. 

I hadn't considered what my budget is for animal care, other than cutting back on dog treats since it gets so expensive, when I can just give them cooked chicken breast, frozen yogurt cubes or safe bite-sized pieces of fruit like an apple at home. 

I also have a cat but she's very easy - I bought extra litter during Black Friday so she is taken care of for a while. 

I've been watching the puppy on the camera and he's so... peaceful. He's comfortable enough to lay down and follow the other dogs, whereas at home, he will get into anything possible or bark at the older dog or outside the window or if I kennel him up. 

Does anyone else do doggy daycare? I did purchase him some puppy training classes because I need the help.

Besides that, I decided to curl my bangs with a sock and giant jawclip. We'll see how this goes! So far heatless overnight curls have been awesome.

1hspe0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1hspe0h/am_i_stupid_for_wanting_to_quit_my_job/,Am I stupid for wanting to quit my job?,"I have my BFA in graphic design, no student loans, but I do have rent, utilities, and a car payment. I'm currently working in healthcare for their marketing department as a Graphic Marketing Specialist. I've been here about a year and a half. I've noticed my mental health slipping and overall happiness going down. My job is 7:30-5pm most days, my office has no windows, and I don't really relate to my coworkers. I'm burnt out, depressed, stressed, all around not doing great. 

Before I started working at the hospital, I was an independent contractor working for a marketing agency. It sucked paying my own taxes, not having benefits, or a retirement plan. BUT I'm considering going back and working from home. I think being able to go out and work from a coffee shop and just having more freedom with my day will help my mental health. I also considered, depending on the hours I can get at the marketing agency, getting a part time barista job. That way some of my time is spent out and socializing while working and then also I have the flexibility of being home for work sometimes. Either way I would feel like I have more freedom and control over my day and not trapped in my dungeon of an office for the majority of my day. Plus there's potential of getting benefits/health insurance from a part time job.

Is this a bad idea?? Am I throwing away a great thing? I have good benefits at my current job, best pay I've ever gotten, PTO, 403b, etc. This just really feels like a step backwards professionally, but I'm not enjoying my life anymore. I need some guidance. What do you think? Anyone go through something similar?

More context: I am 25, non-binary, afab (masc presenting) - I have no queer friends at work, and I get misgendered regularly. I also live in a small town in WI. I don't feel very welcomed by a lot of the people I work with. Some are great though! My ""work circle"" is mostly 40+ year old women. They're awesome, but I just can't relate to them.

We’re lining up to get our tickets, but he insisted that he’ll be the one to pay. Sobrang nice lang to be considered and to be treated in a gentle manner, because of the things he did. 

1) we’re both from South, but he adjusted for me and chose a mall nearer to me. 

2) may lakad din siya with a friend today, but he told his friend na ako uunahin niya huhu cute nito pls, 

3) before the movie he asked me if I wanted to get food and if may tissue ba ako kasi nga nakakaiyak yung green bones

4) he stayed with me pa for coffee after the movie kahit his friend’s already at their meetup place. Also, he wanted to pay for the bill din but sabi ko ako na hahaha

and 5) he gave me smth that he shared with me before (a personal thing hehe) 

wala lang coming from a relationship with someone na laging nagagalit sa mga small inconveniences, sobrang nice to be with someone so gentle and considerate. 🥹 Irdk where were headed yet, but for now people like him really make me happy.

1hspcq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dailybucket/comments/1hspcq1/a_cup_of_coffee_turning_daily_habits_into/,A Cup of Coffee:  Turning Daily Habits into Financial Growth,"Grabbing a daily coffee from your favorite café has become a ritual for many. It’s more than just caffeine. It’s a little moment of joy, a comforting routine, or a way to kickstart your day. For $5 a cup, it’s a habit that feels small, almost insignificant in the grand scheme of things. But have you ever considered what that daily indulgence adds up to over time?

Over a month, this seemingly harmless indulgence amounts to $150. For many, this expense feels justified as it’s a small pleasure in a busy life. But imagine reducing this habit to every other day. That simple shift would free up $75 monthly, money that could be redirected into an investment vehicle like an S&P 500 index fund.

If you invested that $75 a month into an S&P 500 index fund over 5 years, assuming an average annual return of 10%, you would accumulate approximately $4,916. This total includes your contributions of $4,500 and about $416 in interest earned through compound growth. Even with modest monthly contributions, the power of consistent investing and compounding can help grow your money significantly over time.  ",1,1735919110.0,dailybucket,0,1.0,False

As I sip my Kona coffee overlooking the Pacific, living my dream retirement—thanks to TSLA—I felt compelled to write this post. Not because I need to, but because some of you still don't fully understand the magnitude of what you're holding in your hands.

TSLA isn’t just a stock. It’s not a ""trade."" It’s a life-changing opportunity to ride the wave of the most revolutionary company of our time. We’re talking about a once-in-a-lifetime company led by *the* once-in-a-lifetime CEO, Elon Musk—someone I’m convinced was sent down from the heavens to push humanity forward when we needed it the most.

But let’s get something straight. TSLA isn’t for the faint-hearted. If a 10% dip makes you sweat, you’re not cut out for this. Stocks like TSLA are for warriors. You’ve got to have the stomach to hold through the dips because every dip has been a *gift*—a chance for the strong to load up while the weak run for the hills.

I’ve seen it all: the shorts laughing, the media trashing Elon, the bears calling this company a ""bubble."" But where are they now? Still waiting for their ""$20 TSLA"" while I’m here enjoying my retirement, fully funded by this once-in-a-generation rocket ship.

Life is about ups and downs. You can’t climb Everest without some storms. TSLA is no different. It’s not for the gamblers, the doubters, or the weak-willed. It’s for the believers who see beyond the noise, who understand that *this* company is reshaping the world—from energy to AI to transportation and beyond.

If you can’t handle volatility, keep your money in a savings account. Go buy bonds or something. But don’t waste your time—or ours—whining about every red day. TSLA rewards vision, patience, and grit.

To those of you holding strong: keep your eyes on the horizon. The best is yet to come. And to those still hesitating: you’re either on the train or left behind. There is no in-between.

Cheers to the future,  
A retired TSLA holder living the dream. 🌴🚀

I think this is right),"I am new to the espresso space. I enjoy making espresso but I fear that I am bad at it or I’m doing things wrong. I bought a Delonghi Stilosa since it was a fairly cheap option and I’m fairly poor but enjoy making my own coffee, especially living in NYC where everything costs an arm and a leg. Anyways, I’ve noticed some things about this particular espresso machine that don’t work very well and wondering if I can avoid buying a new one by doing things differently or by getting different accessories maybe? One of the things being that it doesn’t handle fine grinded beans which makes the espresso come out quickly and watery. I know there’s a bunch of science behind weighing the beans out to X amt of grams for a double shot and everything of that sort so that could be something I try although not sure it’s an immediate fix. I also know that this particular coffee machine has 15 bar of pressure although not sure if that’s truly representative of the pressure when pushing the water through. I bought a normacore tamper, puck screen and a new bottomless portafiltet but not sure if that’s a fix either. I guess if I were to go another direction with an espresso machine, are there any cheaper options that are more compact?

 I was discarded by a lover with BPD in late September and I'm still deeply wounded by it. It put me into therapy. She and I had a number of problems before that, but the final implosion came as part of her trauma response to being raped by another guy she knew and trusted. I tried to comfort her soon afterward in the way she asked me to, by holding her and giving her non-sexual intimacy and touch, but that triggered her ""flight or fight"" reaction, and since then, the merest suggestion of our ever being intimate again sends her into a panic.

Before, during, and after all this she was seeing another guy, not the rapist. The new guy has driven her to at least one suicide attempt that I know of, and that I talked her down from. And she has said this guy would literally kill her if he knew she was in contact with any former lover. I don't know if by any legal or psychological definition she is an abused woman. But by any common sense definition, she is.

The way she broke up with me was sadistic and cruel. She seemed a different person. She said that the entirety of our relationship was corrupt and warped, because it was only based on sex, and sexual attraction. I have literally hundreds of texts and messages between us proving that is not the case, that there was love and kindness and affection and caring between us. We'd been friends for months before we'd been intimate. But she rewrote our entire history, at least verbally, to me.

Did she in fact discard memories of us along with me?

Am I the only one who remembers what we shared as friends, and then lovers? Taking walks? Going to the movies? Making coffee? The kindness? Curling under a blanket to watch TV? The intimacy? Is all of that truly gone, in her mind? Is it all dust?

This person I loved is in pain.

This person I loved might be in literal, physical danger.

We've had no contact for more than a month.

I'm sad at the loss of my lover.

I'm in agony over the loss of my friend.

I want to be able to help my friend, even if as a pleasant memory of a relationship that won't put her life at risk.

But are we friends, if she discarded all the kind and loving memories of our friendship? Let alone, the time we were intimate?

Has anybody here discarded memories of people? 

Did you reclaim or rediscover them, later?

I really need insight.

1hsp8v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1hsp8v6/husband_wants_to_go_back_to_school/,Husband wants to go back to school,"My husband has been talking about going back to school the entire time I've known him. 

He's gotten a lot more serious about it and asked if I'd support him going back. 

I said that if he can figure out how to make it happen without ruining us financially, then go for it! I'd support him the best I can. He was thrilled by this and started more heavily doing research. 

Last night he comes to me again and goes ""Would you like to move back in with my brother?"" Now, I like his brother. He's a nice dude, his daughter is lovely and the house is huge. However, the whole reason we moved out was because I found out I was pregnant and he didn't want a screaming baby breaking the peace and quiet. Totally get it, his kid was a baby 20 years ago, he's over it lol 

Apparently he had talked to his brother about this as a hypothetical and his brother said it would be fine, just to give him a couple months notice in advance so he could clean the space. 

I don't want to move back in to his brother's house. There's a massive set of stairs to the bedrooms which is hell on my crippled up knee I'm waiting to replace, and there's only one bathroom and it's on the main floor. I remember how shitty that was the first time, having to very slowly and carefully take the stairs every time I had to pee. Super annoying.

But the worst part I think is that the place is A) filthy because the brother and his adult daughter don't clean, basically at all. When we lived there last time, we slowly deep cleaned the all the public spaces but basically I doubt it's been touched since. And B) because it's been 2 adults living there for ages, absolutely nothing is remotely baby proofed. Expensive electronics all over coffee tables and things in the livingroom, misc things all over the floors from never cleaning up, cables and chargers every where, little figures that he paints as a hobby and things like that on all the shelves and tables around. 

We'd have to basically keep the toddler in one, baby proofed room at all times. 

Additionally, it would take us away from our current childcare so we'd have to find someone else to take care of our daughter while I work and he did school full time. 

I get the logistics of the idea. His brother would charge us next to nothing for rent and we'd just have to pay that, half the internet bill and food. So it would have a shit load of money on bills but at what cost? 

I get that he's trying to figure out how to make it all work, but I never thought his immediate idea would be to move us into one or two bed rooms at his brother's for the 2+ years he went to school. 

Now obviously, nothing has been confirmed or anything and he likely wouldn't start school until fall but it's still stressing me out.

It feels like going majorly backwards honestly. We're in a nice, 2 bedroom, ground floor unit right now and our neighbors are a parking lot for a plumbing shop on one side and a soccer field on the other. You basically couldn't get a more chill area if you tried. I'm not trying to be difficult or ruin any dreams here but I don't want to shove my whole life into a bedroom and try to make it work.

I compare the value of games against the value of movies. If a movie ticket is $20 for 2 hours, I need to enjoy a $60 game for at least 6 hours to get my money's worth.

To cross this slightly inflated movie ticket value threshold, Satisfactory had to reach 4 hours of enjoyment (or 12 if you count my kids' copies). Steam says I've played for 2141.8 hours so far (though I know some of that was letting the factories run overnight to slow-build resources).

(The only game family that beats Satisfactory in my library is the Farming Simulator series from 15 to 25 ... currently at a total of 4,729.4 hours across all versions since 15.)

My *current* Satisfactory save file is a very, very casual, heavily-modded playthrough. I started in U7, restarted in U8, and then merged my U8 structures back in to my U7 playthrough with Satisfactory Calculator. I've lost my unmerged U8 files so I don't remember how many hours I had there. My current merged U7 save file has 557 hours.

I recently started calculating what it would take to process all of the Ficsit Farming Jar of Bog Earth at a single facility ... wow, many, many more hours of fun in just that one build and that's only one of 3 resources for *that* mod. (And, by the way, the throughput required for that one resource overwhelms my initial guess by a huge margin!)

All of this is to say: thank you Coffee Stain and thank you to the Satisfactory modding community!

When you're done - either stop drinking coffee altogether or switch on to our [Decaf Blend](https://www.caffeinewean.com/products/caffeineweandecaf?variant=47037592666442) \- because look, we've nothing against coffee.

* Telling my friends I quit drinking, and even telling them that I'm an alcoholic (I know not everyone digs it but this is a label I find strength in). Sharing with my friends brings more outside accountability/the idea of ""no going back,"" and it also released a lot of shame I have around my addiction, which itself is a huge trigger for drinking.
* Journaling. It's nice actually being able to follow a though all the way to the end, and identify and FEEL my feelings. I'm also using it to work things out that I previously would have reacted to in unhealthy and potentially unkind ways. I know I'm a nice person, but drinking makes my temper quite short and my ability to see other's points of view quite limited.

## The Technivorm Moccamaster KBTs Coffee Brewer: A Deep Dive

The Technivorm Moccamaster KBTs isn't just a coffee maker; it's a statement.  For coffee enthusiasts seeking a reliable, high-quality brewer that delivers consistently excellent results, the KBTs model stands out. This in-depth review will explore its key features, address common concerns, and compare it to other top contenders in the market, helping you determine if this precision brewer is the perfect addition to your kitchen.

### Unpacking the Technivorm Moccamaster KBTs: Design and Functionality

Technivorm Moccamaster, a Dutch company, has built a reputation for crafting robust, expertly engineered coffee machines.  The KBTs model, a testament to this commitment, boasts a compact design ideal for smaller kitchens without compromising on performance. Its sleek, minimalist aesthetic blends seamlessly into almost any kitchen setting.

#### Precise Brewing Temperature: The Heart of the KBTs

The KBTs' standout feature is its unwavering commitment to temperature.  The **copper heating element** ensures a consistent brewing temperature between 198-205°F (92-96°C), the optimal range for extracting the full spectrum of flavors from your coffee beans. This precise temperature control minimizes bitterness and maximizes the nuanced taste profile of your chosen roast. This precision is why the Moccamaster KBTs holds the prestigious **SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association of America)** certification.

#### Brewing Speed and Capacity: Efficiency Meets Excellence

Despite its precision, the KBTs is surprisingly efficient.  Brewing a full pot (8 cups/1 liter/34 ounces) takes only 5-6 minutes. This swift brewing process doesn't sacrifice quality; you get a perfectly brewed cup in a fraction of the time it takes with some other methods.

#### The Adjustable Brew Basket: Customization for Every Cup

The KBTs features a manual drip stop on its brew basket, granting you control over the brewing process. Need a single cup? Stop the brewing cycle mid-way. This level of customization allows for flexibility and reduces waste.

#### Thermal Carafe: Keeping Your Coffee Warm and Delicious

The included stainless steel thermal carafe keeps your coffee warm for hours.  No more lukewarm coffee! This ensures every cup, from the first to the last, is enjoyed at its optimal temperature.


#### Filter Options: Paper or Reusable? The Choice is Yours

The KBTs comes with paper cone filters, a readily available and convenient option.  However, environmentally conscious users can opt for reusable **Swiss Gold filters**, reducing waste and contributing to a more sustainable brewing practice. The filter basket also features a drip stop, making removal and cleaning a breeze.

#### Safety and Ease of Use: Thoughtful Design Details

The KBTs incorporates several safety features, including a double safety guard on the copper boiling element and an illuminated on/off switch for easy operation in any lighting conditions.

### Addressing Common Concerns and Questions

Many potential buyers have specific concerns about the KBTs. Let's address some of the most frequently asked questions:

#### **Q: How does the copper heating element ensure consistent brewing temperatures?**

**A:**  Copper is an excellent conductor of heat, allowing for even and rapid heating. The KBTs' heating element is designed to maintain a precise temperature range throughout the entire brewing cycle.

#### **Q:  Is the KBTs suitable for small kitchens?**

**A:** Absolutely! The KBTs' compact design makes it perfect for kitchens with limited counter space.

#### **Q: How easy is the Moccamaster KBTs to clean?**

**A:** Cleaning is straightforward.  The individual brewing components are removable and easy to wash by hand or in a dishwasher (though hand washing is recommended for longevity).

#### **Q: What types of filters are compatible?**

**A:** The KBTs uses standard #4 paper cone filters, and also works with reusable filters.

### Comparing the Technivorm Moccamaster KBTs to Other Brewers

Choosing a coffee brewer can feel overwhelming. Let's compare the KBTs to some leading competitors:

#### Technivorm Moccamaster KBT-741 vs. KBTS:

The key difference lies in size and capacity. The KBT-741 is taller and brews 1.25 liters, while the KBTS brews 1 liter.  Choose the KBT-741 for larger households or those who frequently brew multiple pots. The KBTS is the better choice for smaller spaces.

#### Technivorm Moccamaster KBTs vs. Bonavita Connoisseur 8-Cup:

Both are highly regarded, but the Bonavita emphasizes programmable features, while the Moccamaster prioritizes consistent temperature control and a more streamlined brewing process.

#### Technivorm Moccamaster KBTs vs. Breville Precision Brewer:

The Breville offers more programmable settings and temperature adjustments, catering to users who like to experiment. The Moccamaster KBTs excels in its simplicity and reliability, delivering consistent results without the need for complex adjustments.

#### Automatic Drip vs. Other Brewing Methods:

While pour over methods offer a degree of manual control, the Moccamaster KBTs provides the convenience of automatic brewing with the precision of a pour over, eliminating many variables for consistent results.  French press and espresso require different skill sets and equipment.  The KBTs strikes a balance between convenience and quality.


### Conclusion: Is the Technivorm Moccamaster KBTs Right for You?

The Technivorm Moccamaster KBTs is a premium coffee brewer that delivers on its promise of consistent, high-quality coffee.  Its compact design, precise temperature control, and ease of use make it a strong contender for coffee enthusiasts and home baristas alike.  While the price point is higher than many other drip coffee makers, the superior quality, reliability, and longevity make it a worthwhile investment for those who prioritize exceptional coffee. If you value consistent, delicious coffee and are willing to pay for quality and reliability, the Technivorm Moccamaster KBTs is a top recommendation.


### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* **What is the warranty on the Technivorm Moccamaster KBTs?**  Technivorm offers a 5-year warranty on their brewers.
* **Can I use the KBTs with different types of coffee beans?** Yes, the KBTs is compatible with all types of coffee beans.
* **Is the carafe dishwasher safe?** While the carafe is stainless steel, hand washing is recommended to preserve its finish and quality.
* **How often should I descale the machine?** Depending on your water hardness, descaling should be done every 3-6 months.  Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper descaling.

But since getting my reMarkable, I’ve started using it to track habits in a way that finally feels manageable and motivating. 

Here’s what’s been working for me:

1. **I keep it visual and simple**
   * I created a habit tracker where I fill in a circle each day I complete a habit, like reading or walking. Seeing those circles add up is super satisfying, and it keeps me going.
   * The only rule I follow is: don’t miss two days in a row. Missing one day is fine, but two feels like losing momentum, so I try to get back on track quickly.

https://preview.redd.it/fyar9qulosae1.jpg?width=2381&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95eedb1d1024219ecca66040d7b74f3fefd3599c

1. **Monthly goals and keep motivated**
   * At the start of every month, I jot down five goals that connect to my habits. For example, if I’m tracking reading, my goal might be to finish two books by the end of the month. Writing these goals down gives me a sense of purpose, not just a checklist.
   * I also add small rewards for streaks, like treating myself to a coffee after a 7-day streak of walking or buying a new eBook after finishing a book.

1. **Reflecting and Tweaking**
   * At the end of each month, I use the reflection space in my planner to ask myself a few questions:
      * *Which habits felt good and why?*
      * *What can I tweak next month to do better?*
   * For example, last month I struggled with consistency in tracking my meals, so I’m trying to simplify that process this month by planning meals in advance.

Honestly, my reMarkable has been a game-changer for all of this. Having everything in one place, my goals, habit tracker, reflections, makes it easy to stay organized and focused. Plus, writing it down by hand feels more personal and intentional than using an app.

Are you also using the reMarkable to track your 2025 habits / goals?",136,1735917115.0,RemarkableTablet,4,0.99,False

Idon't feel that sleepy at my classes unlike my peers(they sleep 5 to 7 hours)(i purposefully used the phrase that sleepy, because it has been almost two weeks since we had proper classes. So the events happened at my class is after two weeks of sunlight viewing). One thing I noticed lately is that I feel sleepy after the sunset. Last day i wanted to stay up late so I drank coffee at 6pm but I instantly felt sleepy and went to bed at my usual time( that being 10pm, to 6 am). Oof. I only drink coffee occasionally and whenever I do, I do stay up for decent hours at night.

• grind 16g of dark roast coffee 
• struggle to get it all in the portafilter and spill a bit on the counter

• select the one cup button to run water through 
• lock the portafilter onto the machine and press the two cup button 

I’ve tried this 3 times and so far no coffee has come out. The machines definitely doing something but nothing happens and then it makes a gurgling noise after

I’ve tried without any coffee at all and hardly any water comes out. When I take it out, the portafilter is just filled with water - why would that happen?

One of my goals is to balance some of the doomer posts with various discussion threads that point to more positive parts of life. 

My plans for this weekend are to finally get over this shitty holiday schedule I've had to work for the Christmas and New Year's weeks. Both weeks I had to work Monday, off Tuesday/Wednesday and work Thursday/Friday and it has completely fucked my motivation. I look forward to having a normal weekend again and these are my tentative plans. 

Today/Friday: I work today but after I get off my wife and I are going to do our grocery shopping for the next couple weeks. I've been wanting to get more into cooking Asian cuisine for a while now so I have a couple recipes I'm going to shoot for that require minimal prep. After that we are probably going to play Marvel Rivals and Fortnite and continue our grinds through both of their seasons. 

Saturday: I'll have most of Saturday to do almost nothing of importance which means I'll wake up without an alarm and have some coffee and cook breakfast. I've been really getting into frying up hash brown squares to combat the only breakfast food I really enjoy from fast food, McDonald's hash browns. I'll make these with a few over medium eggs and either some sausage or bacon depending on which one I decide to take out of the freezer. After that I'll probably get a good nap in at some point between gaming and cooking. The plan currently is to make some rice Friday to then make a big batch of fried rice on Saturday that I can then freeze for lunches. Every weekend I prepare like 6-7 lunches that can be frozen and after a couple weeks I have a large variety to choose from for said lunches. 

Sunday: I'll probably clean my gutters because we've been having heavy winds that have caused an absolute shit ton of pine needles to accumulate. I blast it with the pressure washer and it's a mess but it normally keeps everything from getting gunked up for a few months. After that I'll just continue to game and get any chores done so that the week goes smooth. Normally this is just cleaning and hang drying clothes and finishing any additional prep I need to do for the week's dinners.

It was actually REALLY helpful having her there... I'm not sure I would have had the confidence to actually buy anything without her feedback.

So anyway... I'm trying stuff on... she's asked if I'm using the women's changing room (yes I am)... I'm in the room and try on a lovely dress... I like it... I open the door and she takes a look... ""Yes, that really works... that looks great on you..."" So I say I'll try on the next one.

I close the door and the assistant asks if everything is okay. She says ""Yes... he's just trying on the next one.""

From inside the changing room I pipe up... ""Did I hear you say he?""

""Oh yes... sorry... *she's* just trying on the next one.""

I continued... ""Because I'm literally in a women's changing room and you just said how much the dress I'm wearing suits me... what more do I have to do?""

**🚨 Be warned, a LOT of yapping ahead 🚨**

It's been a journey man 

I joined the game again during the 10th anniversary event and had to get used to using these new toppings (figs, zucchinis and artichokes) for the first time, that too without any autobuddies. 

I joined back into the game (seeing posts of the 10th anniversary event/TAE in the sub) after almost a two year break and got greeted with chapter 5 starting. 

But I couldn't focus on it completely since TAE was going on. So my entire pind (pizza-mind) on was that, I watched so many ADs for happiness meter boosts and speedy ovens bro 😭

I cleared it somehowww and after doing that, got into chapter 5. It started off slow but started picking up pace with me searching everyone's pizzerias for their secrets hehe 😋 

And thennnn came in Christmas event which made me stop the chapter in between. 

It got to the point where Nasir would come up every in game day to ask if I needed help XDD

After playing countless hours, somehow I beat the Christmas event too and got back to Chapter 5-

....only to get stuck after searching Dr. K's shop. I read the walkthrough constantly but didn't know what to do, that's when I watched a youtube video and found my way again. 

(Dr. Keh's toppings are so coollll) 

I saw that cool ass Julius Cheeser animation of him threatening me and *boom* chapter 5 is over. 

I waited and worked so much for the fig, zucchini and artichoke autobuddies that I almost gave up on the game when I couldn't find the option to buy them in shop after completing this chapter. 

I played for a few days and got the option! 

In those few days, I almost cried- I was just glad this investigation was over and didn't expect any gifts. 

Throughout the sub, I had seen many pizzerias w a detective theme and always thought of it being an event exclusive decor but- turns outtttt you get it at the end of chapter 5!!! I got itttt and also the sticker for the store front as well as globe for my counter. 

I had tears in my eyes when I got those things. Tears over a game. A game about making pizza. 

What in the Classic Greek is this??? 

I love this game. I know nobody will read so much yap but I just had to get this out of my system. I love this community.

I know some christian couples just like us who met quite young and waited to get married for many years until the circumstances (education, finances, etc.) were right to start a life as a married couple.

Last week I had coffee with a friend who just got married after dating long term and she asked me if my fiancé and I were actually able to wait with sex until we‘re married. Apparently she and her fiancé started sleeping together after their engagement, since after 6 years together they figured, they‘d get married anyway. 

I think it‘s important to talk about such things, since „dating“ like we know it today is different from biblical times.

To me it’s not about testing out the rules like how far can you go with your partner until God gets mad at you. I follow His law because He saved my life and I love Him very much.

I truly want to honor Jesus with every aspect of my life - still, this conversation is stuck in my mind and I can see her point of view as well.

I thought I would add my humble opinion by providing my perspective as an experienced cruiser, but first time Virgin sailor. Please kindly note, these are not gripes and I’m not at all upset or complaining. This has been a great cruise with some unfavorable experiences. I’m thrilled to be on the ship rather than at work and dealing with snowmaggedon in the Midwest which I will be stuck in Miami for awhile when we get back  Sunday

I’m going to give my experience as a longtime Celebrity cruiser. That is my only  basis for  comparison. 

The good:
Food and drink. Incredible 10++++. The sheer amount of variety, uniqueness and inventory is amazing. The fact that it’s consistently delicious is well-deserving of every award Virgin has won for this. We value food and drink on vacation and this cruise has surpassed expectations. Way better than Celebrity, and I like Celebrity’s food 

WiFi-great great great for the free plan. No issues with connectivity for what we needed. 

Activities-the offering for free and paid onboard are incredible. Always some fun and fresh going on for all interests.  U can be out way late if u want which id not so on Celebrity. Or, u can chill in your cabin. Anyone that says Virgin is boring is a damn liar. I have heard and read that criticism and it’s just objectively not true. 

The Bad:

The reservation process. I was able to book my restaurant reservations when they became available with little issue. If I needed to change once aboard it was easy to do so. Our cruise is 8 day and we are able to do each restaurant (both Test Kitchen menus) and the Super Club once. 

However, I one of the reasons I booked this was the fun fitness classes and paid onboard experiences. I bought the Splash of Romance specifically to board early to book what I wanted. As soon as I got on, I sat down to go through the schedule. I got NOTHING I wanted I am not kidding when I say EVERYTHING I wanted was sold out. I find this unacceptable. I don’t want to keep checking my phone to c if a spot opens, because I want to be off my phone on vacation. I don’t want to just  show up, disrupting my day on the chance someone cancels. To ME, this detracts from the experience. 

Also, the crew. I didn’t meet any Happenings cast because of the above reasons. The rest of the crew is disengaged. They don’t say hello first, they don’t talk or call u by name. Upon arrival back from port the just say move forward blah blah blah. This is opposite of what used to. 

Ship shape. It’s beautiful and clean. However, I’m used to seeing constant cleaning on Celebrity. On Celebrity, each public restroom is attended 24/7 and immaculate. Here the bathrooms clean but unkempt. No soap, no paper towels or tp at times and not picked up. They also do not keep up with common spaces throughout the day. 

Events and shows and service. Very chaotic. Even for Scarlet night, the crew did not know what was going on. For certain things we were told to go to one place only for someone else to tell us to go somewhere else. Many times people ask the crew and they either don’t know and made to effort to help or said something wrong. The crew is very cliquey and just cut and dry. Even in restaurants, people would ask about the menu and the staff would be confused and uninformed. 
Due to the fact that the reservation system is constantly changing, restaurant service doesn’t flow well and can get chaotic

The so-so:

The app. Not good and poor functionality for something that is so relied upon for your experience. Also passengers and staff are constantly on the phones, even while walking around and it’s annoying that people aren’t paying attention to what they are doing. 

The cabin. We had a sea view in a corner 11366A. We usually get a balcony but wanted to da e a little for a big cruise we have in June. Totally on me because the layout was inefficient and space was cramped. Hard to get ready and unpack. Very quiet location and we were fine, but just an FYI

Coffee bar-Meh coffee was good but uncomfortable space and seating in too small an area in the middle of the ship. Compared to Bacio on Celebrity (IYKYK) not great and no table service. 

Also, shore excursions meet at the shore excursions desk, which is also a small space in a central area. It leads to chaos and congestion. We first  do any, but there was a lot of complaining. 


Hope this is helpful. We are having a great cruise and are considering booking an itinerary for 2026 if the price is right and maybe a bar tab promo as we do enjoy drinking and there is no unlimited options. 

Happy and safe travels everyone

I think he found out about it or just assumed because on Christmas he watched me give him a lap dance then fucked me afterwards as if he enjoyed what he saw. I couldn't resist the temptation anymore so I texted him the next day and asked if I could suck his friends dick... this was actually a pretty bad idea. He didn't respond until he came home that night and i sat around worried all day! When he finally got home we got in a pretty big fight but for some reason I could still sense that he was into it. We didn't talk about it for a few days but on new years he brought it up without either of us commenting on it. I guess he thought about it for awhile and wanted us to have a 3some together to end the year. I was expecting some sort of rules or guidelines to come with his request but he didn't have any. We got pretty drunk that night and didn't get home until around 1 am, by that time J has usually been asleep for hours and I could tell he was trying to fight falling asleep. When we walked inside I grabbed his hand and asked if he still wanted to try that and his face got red. He hesitated for awhile but I was so excited that he eventually gave in. It started pretty nice. I was on my knees in the living room as they both undressed me, once I was naked I took J's shirt off first and as i was going for his pants he stopped me and motioned for me to go over to L. I'll be honest this was what I was waiting for so I jumped at the opportunity. Before I knew it our roommate had his dick half way down my throat for my bf to see 🥵 he watched me struggle for a little while then as i was coming back to him he mentioned we should head into the bedroom. We chose our room because it's bigger and he felt more comfortable in that space. When I got on the bed L ate my pussy in front of him for the first time while I tried to get him excited. Even when he was in my mouth his dick just wouldn't get hard. It was pretty sad but I was way to drunk to take care of him... I could feel L trying to roll me over so I flipped on my back and before I knew it he was inside of me as J stood beside the bed watching. His dick was out and softer then usual which made it look really small compared to L's. I couldn't help but look away as I began to feel him dive deeper. When my bf sat down on the chair I assumed he just wanted to watch and neither of us hesitated at the small window we had. He fucked me in multiple positions and always lasted way longer then my bf. I have no clue how long we were going at it but as i was in doggy I was positioned to look right at J as as L fucked me harder then he ever could and I seen tears in his eyes.... I obviously ignored them and allowed L to use me however he needed abandoned eventually he flipped me back over so I didn't have to watch that. L came all over my face before getting up to leave the room, he literally walked right past my bf with his dick out as i was fully covered in cum! I cleaned up and we went to bed together without saying much which I assumed was because we were both pretty drunk. The next day he tried to play it off but our roommate was extra flirty in the morning and he even groped my ass a few times while we had coffee. We haven't brought it up yet but I hope to do something like that again. I'll still have my sideline option if he decides he doesn't want that but I really liked how things played out. Something about him watching made me cum twice as hard! Ik I'm a piece of shit and my posts get a lot of hate but I can't help the fact that I love our roommates cock!

How do I address this without revealing I already sort of knew?","So, over the past two months my boyfriend was acting weird and a little sneaky. Around 1 month after, I accidentally found out that my boyfriend had contacted my two best friends to help plan a proposal and already bought a ring. I also found out that he took my mom out for lunch to discuss this with her. My sister also slipped a little and made it more obvious. I knew it was supposed to happen this February but did not know the date.

I already know that I did too much detective work and should not have found this out, and this is completely my fault. So last week my friend randomly texts me that she saw my boyfriend at a coffee shop, and he did not recognize her, and she was saying it as a joke, but she casually mentioned that he was with my dad (she does not know the dynamic of the relationship and that they had not met before). I have always mentioned that I would love to have my parents blessing before a proposal etc, and I know many don't agree but it is still common in the South and especially in my family and this is also my personal preference.

The same day, I called my boyfriend just for a chat and he sounded a little off, so I asked if he's okay and how his is day going but did not reveal that I knew he met my dad. He said that ""It could be better"" and said work was a little overwhelming and he needs to work harder to get into a better position at work as his job is not very stable etc, and he said that would make it easier if at some point this year, I introduce myself to your dad it would be better etc. Again, he did not know I already knew. He also said that if he was a dad he would want his daughter to be stable and with someone worthy etc.

I did not know what to say but 1 am heartbroken. Does this mean the meeting didn't go well? I guessed he did not get my father's blessing, and now I don't know how to feel. 1. I was excited for something that is most likely not going to happen soon anymore (which is my fault). 2. I do not like that this happened, and I cannot discuss it with him or make him feel better. What is the best way to address this?

I didn't mind being friends with her at first, but I was getting a little irritated at how often she would ask to hang out with me. I am autistic and social interactions aren't my strong point.

We ended up arranging a date for Friday (day of posting) where we would both go to the city and hang out at 11am,, this is where things go a bit.. wrong?

I catch a bus and tell her I'm on my way, she messages back saying she is still washing her hair. I'm like.. okayyy? We are supposed to meet in 20 minutes and you still need to catch a bus cmon man.  I arrive at the city 10 minutes before 11 to make sure I am on time to meet her. I messaged her that I am in the city and she says she is still getting ready and drying her hair. ""Okay, that's fine!"" I think, because in my mind she will only be about 10 or 20 minutes late right? RIGHT?

WRONG 

she is a whole HOUR late.
For someone you've only just met it really doesn't set the best example being an hour late to your first hang out. I tell her to try to manage time better and she apologised and blamed it on her not getting enough sleep. Sidenote we went to sleep at the same time and I got to the city right on time.

Through text I also find out she only has £7 to spend,, we are in a city, with the intention of shopping together. Why only bring £7! So that obviously means I have to pay for food etc which is fine by me! 

We get to the coffee shop we intended on meeting at, I ask her if she wanted anything and she orders a drink while I order a drink AND food. Halfway through eating my toastie she asks if I'm going to eat the other slice and if she can have it because she is hungry. Isn't it rude to ask for someone else's food?? I even asked her if she wanted anything. I sighed and gave her my card so she can get herself food.

After eating we start to walk to our favourite shop, while walking she asks me if she can come over to my house

My house? Honey I haven't even known you for a week and you already want to come over?? I thought that was a little weird but I gave her a 'maybe' 

I text my nan asking if she can come over, because she was watching me text. Nan says if you really want to buy I ended up saying 'nan said you can't come over' as I REALLY did not want this person in my room

When we get to the shop I'm looking at a plushie I want, I decide against spending money on it as two toasties and two drinks cost around £20 alone and I'm trying to save money. My friend grabs the plushie I was looking at and talking about and she goes to buy it. The plushie is £10 so I have absolutely no clue where the other £3 came from but okay! She hands it to me and I say thank you, I told her I will pay her back, by paying back I mean giving money back. Not buying something in return as currently I am now broke and can not afford random stuff!

She walks around the shop for another 10 minutes and picks out a plushie, takes it to the cashier and then calls my name! She says to me ""you said you'd pay me back!"" Yes I indeed did but I intended to give her money myself when I can afford to, not be almost pressured into a gift. I internally go oh crap I'm gonna have to buy this now! My card declined as I didn't have enough in my account so of course I have to transfer money from my savings to my spendings that I did not want to spend!! I didn't want to say no as it would make it awkward asf for everyone there so I walk out £8 poorer than I needed to be and a little bit annoyed 

After that we walk around a couple more places and then go to the nearby park, I'm currently sitting on a swing while my friend has been on a walk for about 20 minutes, she just messaged me telling me she needs to go home. Didn't even come over to say goodbye or thank you or anything!!!

A warm fireplace, a large fluffy blanket, a soft snowfall, but there is something about that cup of coffee.  How from the first sip it warms from your soul to your extremities.  The preparation so simple, yet calming.  An easy routine to start the day.  The dull metronome of scooping, pouring, and hitting start. The scent of it being brewed calling to you from a distance as if to say, ""It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.""  The slow discord of the drops pitter pattering in the pot reminiscent of a slow summer rain.  Filling the ceramic mug with heat, radiating through your hands as you eagerly, yet cautiously, take the first sip.  The sharpness of the heat hits your lips and tongue, settling into your mouth as the flavors dance through you. Notes of chocolate, nuts, raisins, and the surprise citrus undertone melodic in their symphony of flavors inviting you for another sip, but there's a resistance.  This is a cup to be savored, not rushed.  As this cup not only brings warmth and flavors, but memories. Memories of a childhood gone by, mornings on the couch next to dad watching the outdoors network on the tv. Memories of mom making her famous monkey bread, to be plucked at with an alarming place.  And the memory of carelessness, of a lack of responsibility, and an abundance of time.

What I do not understand is why would he reach out now after all these years just to be friends. He would talk about his ex and just different semi serious topics when chatting work, finances etc. I don't really understand if and why this person wants to be friends lol

1hsnsb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1hsnsb7/i_dont_think_ill_ever_accept_my_life/,I don't think I'll ever accept my life,"I'll avoid mentioning sensitive words to adhere to the rules here, you can check my post history to see the dark place I'm in.

My most suffering comes from being a short guy, 5'5 to be specific. I do have trauma from childhood that could have caused my growth to be stunned.

I was treated unfairly by my parents, got sexually harassed multiple times by a family member and once by a non related guy in my childhood neighborhood. This caused me to suffer from severe anxiety since then, was 6yo the first time I got sexually harassed.

I have been to more therapy and psychiatry sessions than I could count. It's been 4 years since my first session. 

Needless to say that I've never experienced intimacy in my life and I'm 28yo.

I don't hate women for it though at all, more like I hate our reptile brains that, under natural selection, came to feel attracted only to certain features...height being the top criterion for male attractiveness.

I recently stopped seeing my therapist after she indirectly invalidated my feelings. She asked me whether there is an alternative reality to the one I'm seeking, where I'm married with kids, and still happy. I said No, as these things are fundamental to me and I'm not willing to let go of them.

She kept saying how one can still enjoy life and the small things in it like a cup of coffee, the sunshine...etc. I felt as if she is trying to change what I strive to be and felt extremely invalidated. 

She was my 4th therapist btw.

I don't know what to do now other than the thing I mentioned in one my posts.

I feel like this level of difficulty is too much for me and I don't want to deal with it. I don't enjoy playing on a difficult mode, not even in video games, let alone real life.

I'm not planning on seeing a new therapist, I gave up on the whole field. I realize that my issues are beyond the scope of therapy and there is nothing a therapist can do other than providing me with some coping mechanisms which I'm not interested in as I belive that a life full of cope isn't actually worth it, this is my own opinion though.

I also realize a therapist can't help me accept things I'm not interested in accepting them in the first place.

TBH, I'm writing this just to vent, I'm not expecting any life changing insights since I doubt they even exist.

I’ll be in Iloilo this February and was looking for affordable 1-day tour packages, but I couldn’t find any within my budget. I came across an itinerary on Facebook and was wondering if it’s accurate and doable. I’m unsure about the travel time between spots, especially with traffic. I only have one day to explore Iloilo City because I’ll be spending the other days in Guimaras, Gigantes, and Bacolod and my main focus is visiting museums and trying local food. I’m skipping Garin Farm for now, maybe next time 🙂. What do you guys think about this itinerary?",8,1735914790.0,Iloilo,1,1.0,False

Hi! Just moved and would like to design this room with an organic modern vibe. I am not sure what color rug would look best (beige, brown, or a mix?) and the size of the rug (couch is 140in W, 93in L). 

Thinking of getting a floor length mirror for the right side of the front door (black frame, arch shape maybe?)

Also thinking maybe updating coffee table to a round one to balance with all the rectangular shapes already or ditching a coffee table and getting round end tables? 

And then the space to the left of the sofa I am so conflicted with what to do with it. Any advice would be helpful! Thank you!",1,1735914768.0,DesignMyRoom,2,1.0,False

And why did the ruling class let it happened?,"Before 1500, only 10% of English population was literate. By 1750, 50% could at least sign their name. By 1820, 53% of English population was literate and by 1870 it was 76%. In France in 1680, only 29% of men and 14% of women were literate; by late 1700s, 47% of men and 27% of women were literate. How did Western nation see such rapid rise in literacy? Was this because of public initiative?

Given that an educated population was prone to revolt against the absolute monarch who reigned supreme in Europe during the late 1600s to early 1800s, why did the rulers of the time allowed their population to be literate? I remembered that they were so paranoid of smart people, they tried to portray coffee as bad and liquors as good so the population would drink themselves to death instead of drinking coffee, stay sober, and discuss politics. Seeing how most of the populations were farmers and workers who did not need much education to be productive, why did the monarchs not work harder to suppress literacy?

I'm strongly leaning toward the Fellow Ode Gen 2 at this stage, but would like hear from people who might recommend I consider alternatives (electric grinders only, please. I've already been given a nice hand grinder as a Christmas gift).

Here are my criteria and considerations:

**Filter Coffee Only**: We drink exclusively filter coffee in my house and I don't have any interest in espresso. I have three brewers I use regularly: Clever Dripper (typically first cup while bleary-eyed), Hario V60, and Aeropress.

**OEM Burrs, please**: I'm not interested in switching out the burrs. I'm someone who is guaranteed to mess up even the simplest mechanical job, and I'm not really interested in jeopardizing the warranty. The bottom line here: If the burr set isn't good enough to justify using it out of the box for the next ten years, I'd rather spending the extra money on a grinder that can deliver.

**Bang for Buck Consideration**: My price range has some flexibility in it. But if I'm pressed for details I'd like to stay around $400. If there's a massive improvement in performance by jumping up to $600 or mmmmmaaaaaybe $800, I'll listen to the advice, but it had better really crush the competition on a performance level out of the box.

**Customer Service/Support**: Every piece of coffee equipment I've ever owned has needed some sort of support from the company. A reliable support team and warranty are definite plusses in my book.

Both in our 30s.  
  
He was very nice & said I was so beautiful, we got on really well in those short 3 minutes, he asked for my number and I gave it to him.He texted me almost straight away to say he wanted to meet me and go for some coffee, but I unfortunately had to fly back home to England.  
  
I visited Scotland again on the 30th December. He said he absolutely wanted to meet me. I met him and we had an amazing time. He kissed me at the end, on the lips and on my hand and asked me multiple times if I wanted to see him again, I said yes definitely.After the date, he texted me to say ""enjoy your show"" with a smiley face, because I had booked to see a theatre show while I was there.

I flew back the next morning. 

I haven't heard from him since then. I decided to text him this morning.

Me: when do you think we can see each other again, I really liked you""  
  
him = good morning, yes we will arrange something again, do you plan on coming to scotland again soon?

me = no plans

him = i can come over to you. possibly around march, got a few things here to do first 

me = ok thats good id really like to see you if you come

him = yes absolutely, i will say i enjoyed the kiss we had at the end

Hi all! There is a scooter’s attached to the building I work in, and I love a good drink as a Friday treat, but I am on a medication that already raises my heart rate a bit.

For that reason, I tend to avoid coffee or the Red Bull drinks. I love their lemonade, matcha, custom tea lattes like a London Fog, and I am open to trying smoothies or blended drinks. I’m excited to try the new blackberry syrup and I wish I could do the blackberry Red Bull infusion but my heart rate would be sky high 😂😂

I would love ideas or recommendations for drinks you love that aren’t coffee and have low caffeine! Thank you in advance!

https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/01/habit-goal-psychology-resolution/681196/

You probably remember when you took your last shower, but if I ask you to examine your routine more closely, you might discover some blank spots. Which hand do you use to pick up the shampoo bottle? Which armpit do you soap up first?

Bathing, brushing your teeth, driving to work, making coffee—these are all core habits. In 1890, the psychologist William James observed that living creatures are nothing if not “bundles of habits.” Habits, according to James’s worldview, are a bargain with the devil. They make life easier by automating behaviors you perform regularly. (I would rather attend to what I read in the news on a given morning, for example, than to the minutiae of how I steep my daily tea.) But once an action becomes a habit, you can lose sight of what prompts it, or if you even like it very much. (Maybe the tea would taste better if I steeped it longer.)

Around the new year, countless people pledge to reform their bad habits and introduce new, better ones. Yet the science of habits reveals that they are not beholden to our desires. “We like to think that we’re doing things for a reason, that everything is driven by a goal,” Wendy Wood, a provost professor emerita who studies habit at the University of Southern California, told me. But goals seem like our primary motivation only because we’re more conscious of them than of how strong our habits are. In fact, becoming aware of your invisible habits can boost your chances of successfully forming new, effective habits or breaking harmful ones this resolution season, so that you can live a life dictated more by what you enjoy and less by what you’re used to.",3,1735914117.0,atlanticdiscussions,3,1.0,False
