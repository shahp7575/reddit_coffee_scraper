1lbtfpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lbtfpt/before_i_fall_by_lauren_oliver_she_says_she_likes/,"Before I Fall by Lauren Oliver: She says she likes the way she talks. I take them from her. They’re cashmere and she’s probably gotten peanut butter on them. She’s always scooping around in jars of the stuff. “What did I tell you, Izzy?” I say, poking her in the middle of the forehead. “Don’t.....","ONE  
Beep, beep,” Lindsay calls out. A few weeks ago my mom yelled at her for blasting her horn at six fifty-five every morning, and this is Lindsay’s solution. I’m coming!” I shout back, even though she can see me pushing out the front door, trying to put on my coat and wrestle my binder into my bag at the same time.  At the last second, my eight-year-old sister, Izzy, tugs at me.  “What?” I whirl around. She has little-sister radar for when I’m busy, late, or on the phone with my boyfriend. Those are always the times she chooses to bother me.  “You forgot your gloves,” she says, except it comes out: “You forgot your gloveths. ” She refuses to go to speech therapy for her lisp, even though all the kids in her grade make fun of her. She says she likes the way she talks.  I take them from her. They’re cashmere and she’s probably gotten peanut butter on them. She’s always scooping around in jars of the stuff.  “What did I tell you, Izzy?” I say, poking her in the middle of the forehead. “Don’t touch my stuff. ” She giggles like an idiot and I have to hustle her inside while I shut the door. If it were up to her, she would follow me around all day like a dog.  By the time I make it out of the house, Lindsay’s leaning out the window of the Tank. That’s what we call her car, an enormous silver Range Rover. (Every time we drive around in it at least one person says, “That thing’s not a car, it’s a truck,” and Lindsay claims she could go head-to-head with an eighteen-wheel  
er and come out without a scratch. ) She and Ally are the only two of us with cars that actually belong to them. Ally’s car is a tiny black Jetta that we named the Minime. I get to borrow my mom’s Accord sometimes; poor Elody has to make do with her father’s ancient tan Ford Taurus, which hardly runs anymore.  The air is still and freezing cold. The sky is a perfect, pale blue. The sun has just risen, weak and watery-looking, like it has just spilled itself over the horizon and is too lazy to clean itself up. It’s supposed to storm later, but you’d never know.  I get into the passenger seat. Lindsay’s already smoking and she gestures with the end of her cigarette to the Dunkin’ Donuts coffee she got for me.  
  
  “Bagels?” I say.  
  
  “In the back. ”  
  
  “Sesame?”  
  
  “Obviously. ” She looks me over once as she pulls out of my driveway. “Nice skirt. ”  
  
  “You too. ”  
  
  Lindsay tips her head, acknowledging the compliment. We’re actually wearing the same skirt. There are only two days of the year when Lindsay, Ally, Elody, and I deliberately dress the same: Pajama Day during Spirit Week, because we all bought cute matching sets at Victoria’s Secret last Christmas, and Cupid Day. We spent three hours at the mall arguing about whether to go for pink or red outfits—Lindsay hates pink; Ally lives in it—and we finally settled on black miniskirts and some red fur-trimmed tank tops we found in the clearance bin at Nordstrom.  
  
  Like I said, those are the only times we deliberately look alike. But the truth is that at my high school, Thomas Jefferson, everyone kind of looks the same. There’s no official uniform—it’s a public school—but you’ll see the same outfit of Seven jeans, gray New Balance sneakers, a white T-shirt, and a colored North Face fleece jacket on nine out of ten students. Even the guys and the girls dress the same, except our jeans are tighter and we have to blow out our hair every day. It’s Connecticut: being like the people around you is the whole point.  
  
  That’s not to say that our high school doesn’t have its freaks—it does—but even the freaks are freaky in the same way. The Eco-Geeks ride their bikes to school and wear clothing made of hemp and never wash their hair, like having dreadlocks will somehow help curb the emission of greenhouse gases. The Drama Queens carry big bottles of lemon tea and wear scarves even in summer and don’t talk in class because they’re “conserving their voices. ” The Math League members always have ten times more books than anyone else and actually still use their lockers and walk around with permanently nervous expressions, like they’re just waiting for somebody to yell, “Boo!”  
  
  I don’t mind it, actually. Sometimes Lindsay and I make plans to run away after graduation and crash in a loft in New York City with this tattoo artist her stepbrother knows, but secretly I like living in Ridgeview. It’s reassuring, if you know what I mean.  
  
  I lean forward, trying to apply mascara without gouging my eye out. Lindsay’s never been the most careful driver and has a tendency to jerk the wheel around, come to sudden stops, and then gun the engine.  
  
  “Patrick better send me a rose,” Lindsay says as she shoots through one stop sign and nearly breaks my neck slamming on the brakes at the next one. Patrick is Lindsay’s on-again, off-again boyfriend. They’ve broken up a record thirteen times since the start of the school year.

  
I had to sit next to Rob while he filled out the request form,” I say, rolling my eyes. “It was like forced labor. ”  
  
  Rob Cokran and I have been going out since October, but I’ve been in love with him since sixth grade, when he was too cool to talk to me. Rob was my first crush, or at least my first real crush. I did once kiss Kent McFuller in third grade, but that obviously doesn’t count since we’d just exchanged dandelion rings and were pretending to be husband and wife.  
  
  “Last year I got twenty-two roses. ” Lindsay flicks her cigarette butt out of the window and leans over for a slurp of coffee. “I’m going for twenty-five this year. ”  
  
  Each year before Cupid Day the student council sets up a booth outside the gym. For two dollars each, you can buy your friends Valograms—roses with little notes attached to them—and then they get delivered by Cupids (usually freshman or sophomore girls trying to get in good with the upperclassmen) throughout the day.  
  
  “I’d be happy with fifteen,” I say. It’s a big deal how many roses you get. You can tell who’s popular and who isn’t by the number of roses they’re holding. It’s bad if you get under ten and humiliating if you don’t get more than five—it basically means that you’re either ugly or unknown. Probably both. Sometimes people scavenge for dropped roses to add to their bouquets, but you can always tell.  
  
  “So. ” Lindsay shoots me a sideways glance. “Are you excited? The big day. Opening night. ” She laughs. “No pun intended. ”  
  
  I shrug and turn toward the window, watching my breath frost the pane. “It’s no big deal. ” Rob’s parents are away this weekend, and a couple of weeks ago he asked me if I could spend the whole night at his house. I knew he was really asking if I wanted to have sex. We’ve gotten semi-close a few times, but it’s always been in the back of his dad’s BMW or in somebody’s basement or in my den with my parents asleep upstairs, and it’s always felt wrong.  
  
  So when he asked me to stay the night, I said yes without thinking about it.  
  
  Lindsay squeals and hits her palm against the steering wheel. “No big deal? Are you kidding? My baby’s growing up. ”  
  
  “Oh, please. ” I feel heat creeping up my neck and know my skin’s probably going red and splotchy. It does this whenever I’m embarrassed. All the dermatologists, creams, and powders in Connecticut don’t help. When I was younger kids used to sing, “What’s red and white and weird all over? Sam Kingston!”  
  
  I shake my head a little and rub the vapor off the window. Outside the world sparkles, like it’s been coated in varnish. “When did you and Patrick do it, anyway? Like three months ago?”  
  
  “Yeah, but we’ve been making up for lost time since then. ” Lindsay rocks against her seat.  
  
  “Gross. ”  
  
  “Don’t worry, kid. You’ll be fine. ”  
  
  “Don’t call me kid. ” This is one reason I’m happy I decided to have sex with Rob tonight: so Lindsay and Elody won’t make fun of me anymore. Thankfully, since Ally’s still a virgin it means I won’t be the very last one, either. Sometimes I feel like out of the four of us I’m always the one tagging along, just there for the ride. “I told you it was no big deal. ”  
  
  “If you say so. ”  
  
  Lindsay has made me nervous, so I count all the mailboxes as we go by. I wonder if by tomorrow everything will look different to me; I wonder if I’ll look different to other people. I hope so.  
  
  We pull up to Elody’s house and before Lindsay can even honk, the front door swings open and Elody starts picking her way down the icy walkway, balancing on three-inch heels, like she can’t get out of her house fast enough.  
  
  “Nipply outside much?” Lindsay says when Elody slides into the car. As usual she’s wearing only a thin leather jacket, even though the weather report said the high would be in the mid-twenties.  
  
  “What’s the point of looking cute if you can’t show it off?” Elody shimmies her boobs and we crack up. It’s impossible to stay stressed when she’s around, and the knot in my stomach loosens.  
  
  Elody makes a clawing gesture with her hand and I pass her a coffee. We all take it the same way: large hazelnut, no sugar, extra cream.  
  
  “Watch where you’re sitting. You’ll squish the bagels. ” Lindsay frowns into the rearview mirror.  
  
  “You know you want a piece of this. ” Elody gives her butt a smack and we all laugh again.  
  
  “Save it for Muffin, you horn dog. ”  
  
  Steve Dough is Elody’s latest victim. She calls him Muffin because of his last name, and because he’s yummy (she says; he looks too greasy for me, and he always smells like pot). They have been hooking up for a month and a half now.  
  
  Elody’s the most experienced of any of us. She lost her virginity sophomore year and has already had sex with two different guys. She was the one who told me she was sore after the first couple of times she had sex, which made me ten times more nervous. It may sound crazy, but I never really thought of it as something physical, something that would make you sore, like soccer or horseback riding. I’m scared that I won’t know what to do, like when we used to play basketball in gym and I’d always forget who I was supposed to be guarding or when I should pass the ball and when I should dribble it.  
  
  “Mmm, Muffin. ” Elody puts a hand on her stomach. “I’m starving. ”  
  
  “There’s a bagel for you,” I say.  
  
  “Sesame?” Elody asks.  
  
  “Obviously,” Lindsay and I say at the same time. Lindsay winks at me.  
  
  Just before we get to school we roll down the windows and blast Mary J. Blige’s “No More Drama. ” I close my eyes and think back to homecoming and my first kiss with Rob, when he pulled me toward him on the dance floor and suddenly my lips were on his and his tongue was sliding under my tongue and I could feel the heat from all the colored lights pressing down on me like a hand, and the music seemed to echo somewhere behind my ribs, making my heart flutter and skip in time. The cold air coming through the window makes my throat hurt and the bass comes through the soles of my feet just like it did that night, when I thought I would never be happier; it goes all the way up to my head, making me dizzy, like the whole car is going to split apart from the sound.  
  
  POPULARITY: AN ANALYSIS  
  
  Popularity’s a weird thing. You can’t really define it, and it’s not cool to talk about it, but you know it when you see it. Like a lazy eye, or porn.  
  
  Lindsay’s gorgeous, but the rest of us aren’t that much prettier than anybody else. Here are my good traits: big green eyes, straight white teeth, high cheekbones, long legs. Here are my bad traits: a too-long nose, skin that gets blotchy when I’m nervous, a flat butt.  
  
  Becky DiFiore’s just as pretty as Lindsay, and I don’t think Becky even had a date to junior homecoming. Ally’s boobs are pretty big, but mine are borderline nonexistent (when Lindsay’s in a bad mood she calls me Samuel, not Sam or Samantha). And it’s not like we’re shiny perfect or our breath always smells like lilacs or something. Lindsay once had a burping contest with Jonah Sasnoff in the cafeteria and everyone applauded her. Sometimes Elody wears fuzzy yellow slippers to school. I once laughed so hard in social studies I spit up vanilla latte all over Jake Somers’s desk. A month later we made out in Lily Angler’s toolshed. (He was bad. )  
  
  The point is, we can do things like that. You know why? Because we’re popular. And we’re popular because we can get away with everything. So it’s circular.  
  
  I guess what I’m saying is there’s no point in analyzing it. If you draw a circle, there will always be an inside and an outside, and unless you’re a total nut job, it’s pretty easy to see which is which. It’s just what happens.  
  
  I’m not going to lie, though. It’s nice that everything’s easy for us. It’s a good feeling knowing you can basically do whatever you want and there won’t be any consequences. When we get out of high school we’ll look back and know we did everything right, that we kissed the cutest boys and went to the best parties, got in just enough trouble, lis  
tened to our music too loud, smoked too many cigarettes, and drank too much and laughed too much and listened too little, or not at all. If high school were a game of poker, Lindsay, Ally, Elody, and I would be holding 80 percent of the cards.  
  
  And believe me: I know what it’s like to be on the other side. I was there for the first half of my life. The bottom of the bottom, lowest of the low. I know what it’s like to have to squabble and pick and fight over the leftovers.  
  
  So now I have first pick of everything. So what. That’s the way it is.  
  
  Nobody ever said life was fair.  
  
  We pull into the parking lot exactly ten minutes before first bell. Lindsay guns it toward the lower lot, where the faculty spaces are, scattering a group of sophomore girls. I can see red and white lace dresses peeking out under their coats, and one of them is wearing a tiara. Cupids, definitely.  
  
  “Come on, come on, come on,” Lindsay mutters as we pull behind the gym. This is the only row in the lower lot not reserved for staff. We call it Senior Alley, even though Lindsay’s been parking here since junior year. It’s the VIP of parking at Jefferson, and if you miss out on a spot—there are only twenty of them—you have to park all the way in the upper lot, which is a full . 22 miles from the main entrance. We checked one time, and now whenever we talk about it we have to use the exact distance. Like, “Do you really want to walk . 22 miles in this rain?”  
  
  Lindsay squeals when she sees an open space, jerking her wheel to the left. At the same time, Sarah Grundel is pulling up her brown Chevrolet from the other direction, angling it into the spot.  
  
  “Oh, hell no. No way. ” Lindsay leans on the horn, even though it’s obvious Sarah was here before us, then presses her foot on the accelerator. Elody shrieks as hot coffee sloshes all over her shirt. There is the high-pitched squeal of rubber, and Sarah Grundel slams on her brakes just before Lindsay’s Range Rover takes off her bumper.  
  
  “Nice. ” Lindsay pulls into the spot and throws her car in park. Then she opens her door and leans out.  
  
  “Sorry, sweetie!” she calls to Sarah. “I didn’t see you there. ” This is obviously a lie.  
  
  “Great. ” Elody is mopping up coffee with a balled-up Dunkin’ Donuts napkin. “Now I get to go around all day with my boobs smelling like hazelnut. ”  
  
  “Guys like food smells,” I say. “I read it in Glamour. ”  
  
  “Put a cookie down your pants and Muffin will probably jump you before homeroom. ” Lindsay flips down the rearview mirror and checks her face.  
  
  “Maybe you should try it with Rob, Sammy. ” Elody throws the coffee-stained napkin at me and I catch it and peg it back.  
  
  “What?” She’s laughing. “You didn’t think I’d forget about your big night, did you?” She fishes in her bag and the next thing that flies over the seat is a crumpled-up condom with bits of tobacco stuck to its wrapper. Lindsay cracks up.

You’re pagans,” I say, taking the condom with two fingers and dropping it in Lindsay’s glove compartment. Just touching it gets my nerves going again, and I can feel something twist at the bottom of my stomach. I’ve never understood why condoms are kept in those little foil wrappers. They look so clinical, like something your doctor would prescribe for allergies or intestinal problems.  
  
  “No glove, no love,” Elody says, leaning forward and kissing my cheek. She leaves a big circle of pink lip gloss there.  
  
  “Come on. ” I get out of the car before they can see I’m blushing.  
  
  Mr. Otto, the athletic director, is standing outside the gym when we’re getting out of the car, probably checking out our asses. Elody thinks the reason he insisted his office be right next to the girls’ dressing room is because he rigged up a camera feed from his computer to the toilet. Why else would he even need a computer? He’s the athletic director. Now every time I pee in the gym I get paranoid.  
  
  “Move it, ladies,” he calls to us. He’s also the soccer coach, which is ironic since he probably couldn’t run to the vending machine and back. He looks like a walrus. He even has a mustache. “I don’t want to have to give you a late slip. ”  
  
  “I don’t want to have to spank you. ” I do an impression of his voice, which is strangely high-pitched—another reason Elody thinks he might be a pedophile. Elody and Lindsay crack up.  
  
  “Two minutes to bell,” Otto says, more sharply. Maybe he heard me. I don’t really care.  
  
  “Happy Friday,” Lindsay grumbles, and puts her arm through mine.  
  
  Elody has taken out her cell phone and is checking her teeth in its reflective back, picking out sesame seeds with a pinkie nail.  
  
  “This sucks,” she says, without looking up.  
  
  “Totally,” I say. Fridays are the hardest in some ways: you’re so close to freedom. “Kill me now. ”  
  
  “No way. ” Lindsay squeezes my arm. “Can’t let my best friend die a virgin. ”  
  
  You see, we didn’t know.  
  
  My first two periods—art and AHAP (American History Advanced Placement; history’s always been my best subject)—I get only five roses. I’m not that stressed about it, although it does kind of piss me off that Eileen Cho gets four roses from her boyfriend, Ian Dowel. It didn’t even occur to me to ask Rob to do that, and in a way I don’t think it’s fair. It makes people think you’ve got more friends than you do.  
  
  As soon as I make it to chemistry, Mr. Tierney announces a pop quiz. This is a big problem since (1) I haven’t understood a word of my homework in four weeks (okay, so I stopped trying after week one) and (2) Mr. Tierney’s always threatening to phone in failing grades to college admissions committees, since a lot of us haven’t been accepted to school yet. I’m not sure whether he’s serious or whether he’s just trying to keep the seniors in line, but there is no way I’m letting some fascist teacher ruin my chances of getting into BU.  
  
  Even worse, I’m sitting next to Lauren Lornet, possibly the only person in the class more clueless about this stuff than I am.  
  
  Actually my grades have been pretty good in chem this year, but it isn’t because I’ve had a sudden epiphany about proton-electron interaction. My straight A–average can be summarized in two words: Jeremy Ball. He’s skinnier than I am and his breath always smells like cornflakes, but he lets me copy his homework and inches his desk closer to mine on test days so I can peek over at his answers without being obvious. Unfortunately, since I stop before Tierney’s class to pee and check in with Ally—we always meet in the bathroom before fourth period, since she has biology at the same time I have chem—I arrive too late to get my usual seat next to Jeremy.  
  
  There are three questions on Mr. Tierney’s quiz, and I don’t know enough to fake an answer to a single one. Next to me, Lauren’s doubled over her paper, tongue just poking out between her teeth. She always does that when she thinks. Her first answer’s looking pretty good, actually: her answers are neat and deliberate, not frantically scribbled like you do when you don’t know what you’re talking about and are hoping if you scrawl enough your teacher won’t notice. (For the record, it never works. ) Then I remember that Mr. Tierney lectured Lauren about improving her grade last week. Maybe she’s been studying extra hard.  
  
  I peek over Lauren’s shoulder and copy down two of her answers—I’m good at being subtle about it—when Mr. Tierney calls out, “Threeeeee minutes. ” He says it dramatically, like he’s doing a voice-over for a movie, and it makes the fat under his chin wiggle.  
  
  It looks like Lauren’s finished and checking her work, but she’s leaning so I can’t see the third answer. I watch the second hand tick its way around the clock—“Two miiinnnuuutes and thirrrrty secondssss,” Tierney booms—and I lean over and poke Lauren with my pen. She looks up, startled. I don’t think I’ve talked to her in years, and for a second I see a look pass over her face that I can’t quite identify.  
  
  Pen, I mouth to her.  
  
  She looks confused and shoots a glance up at Tierney, who is thankfully bent over the textbook.  
  
  “What?” she whispers.  
  
  I make some gestures with my pen, trying to communicate to her that I’ve run out of ink. She’s staring at me dumbly, and for a second I feel like reaching out and shaking her—“Twwooooo minnnutttesss”—but finally her face clears up and she grins like she’s just figured out how to cure cancer. I don’t want to sound harsh, but it’s such a waste to be a dork and kind of slow on the uptake. What’s the point if you can’t at least play Beethoven or win state spelling bees or go to Harvard or something?  
  
  While Lauren’s bent over rummaging for a pen in her bag, I copy down the final answer. I kind of forget I even asked her for a pen, actually, because she has to whisper at me to get my attention.  
  
  “Thirrrrttttyyyy seconnndss. ”  
  
  “Here. ”  
  
  I take it from her. One end is chewed: gross. I give her a tight smile and look away, but a second later she whispers, “Does it work?”  
  
  I give her a look so she’ll know that now she’s being annoying. I guess she takes it as a sign I don’t understand.  
  
  “The pen. Does it work?” she whispers a little louder.  
  
  That’s when Tierney slams the textbook against his desk. The sound is so loud we all jump.  
  
  “Miss Lornet,” he bellows, glaring at Lauren. “Are you talking during my quiz?”  
  
  She turns bright red and looks back and forth from me to the teacher, licking her lips. I don’t say anything.  
  
  “I was just—” she says faintly.  
  
  “Enough. ” He stands up, frowning so hard his mouth looks like it’s going to melt into his neck, and crosses his arms. I think he’s going to say something more to Lauren because he’s shooting her a death stare, but instead he just says, “Time, everybody. Pencils and pens down. ”  
  
  I go to give Lauren’s pen back to her but she won’t take it.  
  
  “Keep it,” she says.  
  
  “No, thanks,” I say. I hold it between two fingers and lean over, dangling it above her desk, but she tucks her hands behind her back.  
  
  “Seriously,” she says, “you’re going to need a pen. For notes and stuff. ” She’s looking at me like she’s offering me something miraculous and not a Bic pen with slobber on it. I don’t know if it’s her expression or not, but all of a sudden I remember the time we went on a field trip in second grade, and the two of us were the only ones left after everyone had chosen their buddies. We had to hold hands for the rest of the day whenever we crossed the street, and hers were always sweaty. I wonder if she remembers. I hope not.  
  
  I smile tightly and drop the pen in my bag. She grins from ear to ear. I’ll throw it out as soon as we’re done with class, of course; you never know what kind of diseases get carried through slobber.  
  
  On the bright side: my mom always said you should do one nice thing a day. So I guess that means I’m in the clear.

I decided to ask this question here for one very important reason. I don't want to clone mainstream social media platforms. Each platform have their pros and cons, and I would like to figure out which pros are especially important and which cons should be avoided at all cost.

1lbt9rw,https://youtu.be/ZOlIfrA6EGQ,3 Very Scary TRUE Backyard Encounters Horror Stories,"# ""The Man at the Fence"":

I was 10 years old when the strange things started at our house. It was an old, creaky place, with warped wooden floors that groaned under every step and windows that rattled in their frames. The backyard was huge, a wide stretch of patchy grass bordered by a tall wooden fence, weathered and splintered from years of neglect. Beyond the fence, dense woods loomed, their branches tangled like they were hiding something. I used to love that yard, spending hours kicking a soccer ball against the fence or climbing the gnarled apple tree in the corner. But that all changed one quiet afternoon.It began with knocks on the front door. Three sharp raps, so loud they cut through the cartoon I was watching on the living room couch. My heart skipped, and I slid off the couch, my socks slipping on the slick floor as I ran to the door. I pressed my face to the narrow window beside it, expecting to see a delivery guy or maybe a kid from school pulling a prank. But the porch was empty, just the worn welcome mat and a few scattered leaves. I stood there, my breath fogging the glass, waiting for someone to pop out and laugh. Nobody did.The knocks came again the next day, same time, same rhythm. I checked again, my hands sweaty on the doorknob, but the porch was still empty. By the third day, I was scared to even go near the door. My stomach twisted every time I heard those raps, like someone was playing a game I didn’t understand. That night, I told Mom while she was chopping carrots for dinner, the knife thumping against the cutting board.“Mom, someone keeps knocking on the door, but when I look, there’s no one there,” I said, my voice small.She paused, wiping her hands on her apron. “Are you sure, honey? Maybe it’s just the house settling.”“It’s not the house. It’s loud, like someone’s banging on purpose.”She frowned, her eyes searching my face. “Okay, I’ll check the locks before bed. But don’t open the door if you don’t see anyone, alright?”I nodded, but her words didn’t help. That night, I lay in bed, my blanket pulled up to my chin, listening for those knocks. Every creak of the house made me flinch, and I kept my eyes on the dark outline of my bedroom door, half-expecting it to swing open.A week later, I was in the backyard, bouncing my soccer ball off the fence. The yard felt different now, like the air was heavier. I kept glancing at the woods, their shadows stretching long across the grass. Then I saw him. A man, tall and thin, standing just beyond the fence, half-hidden by the trees. He wore a black hoodie, the hood pulled low so I couldn’t see his face. He didn’t move, just stood there, his head tilted toward our house, like he was studying it. My ball slipped from my hands, rolling into the weeds, but I couldn’t look away from him. My chest tightened, and my legs felt like they were glued to the ground.He didn’t wave or step closer, but his stillness was worse. It was like he wanted me to see him, wanted me to know he was there. I backed up, my sneakers catching on a root, and then I turned and bolted for the house. I slammed the back door so hard the glass pane shook, and I fumbled with the lock, my fingers clumsy.“Mom!” I shouted, my voice cracking. She was in the living room, folding a pile of towels, the TV humming in the background.“What’s wrong?” she asked, standing up fast.“There’s a man in the backyard! He’s just standing there, watching the house!” I was shaking now, my words tumbling out.She hurried to the back door, pulling the faded curtain aside. I clung to her arm, peeking over her shoulder. The yard was empty, just the fence and the dark woods beyond. The apple tree’s branches swayed slightly, but there was no sign of the man.“I don’t see anyone,” she said, her voice soft but uneasy. She locked the door and turned to me. “Are you sure you saw someone?”“He was there, Mom! He was tall, all in black, with a hood. He was right by the fence.”She knelt down, her hands on my shoulders. “Maybe it was a neighbor checking something out, or someone lost in the woods. But you stay inside for the rest of the day, okay?”I nodded, but I knew it wasn’t a neighbor. Neighbors don’t hide in the trees and stare like that. I didn’t go back outside for days, and when I looked out my bedroom window, I kept the curtain cracked just enough to watch the yard.The man came back. Not every day, but often enough that I stopped feeling safe. I’d see him from my room, always at dusk when the light was fading, his black hoodie blending into the shadows. Sometimes he’d be by the fence, other times closer, standing near the apple tree, his hands in his pockets. Once, I saw him press his hand against the fence, like he was testing it. I’d duck behind the curtain, my heart pounding so loud I thought he’d hear it. I stopped telling Mom every time, because she’d just say I was imagining things, but I knew I wasn’t.One night, when I was 11, the phone rang during dinner. Mom answered, her fork still in her hand. “Hello?” she said, then paused. Her face went pale, and she gripped the phone tighter. “Who is this?” There was no answer, just a low, heavy breathing. She slammed the phone down, her hands trembling.“Who was that?” I asked, my spaghetti suddenly cold in my mouth.“Probably a prank call,” she said, but her voice was tight. She forced a smile. “Eat your dinner, honey.”The calls kept coming, sometimes in the middle of the night. I’d hear the phone’s shrill ring echo through the house, and Mom would unplug it after the first one. The breathing was always the same, slow and deliberate, like whoever it was wanted us to know they were there. I started sleeping with my door open, just so I could hear Mom moving around if something happened.By the time I was 12, things got worse. I was home alone after school one day, sprawled on the kitchen table with my math homework. The house was quiet, except for the hum of the fridge. Then the back door rattled, a sharp jolt that made my pencil skid across the page. I froze, staring at the door. It rattled again, harder, and I heard the wood groan, like someone was pushing against it. My mouth went dry, and I slid off the chair, my knees wobbling.I crept to the living room, grabbing the cordless phone from the coffee table. The rattling turned into a thud, and I heard a scraping sound, like metal on wood. I dialed Mom’s work number, my fingers shaking so bad I messed it up twice.“Mom, he’s here again! He’s trying to get in!” I whispered when she answered, my voice barely holding together.“Stay calm, honey. Lock yourself in the bathroom and call 911. I’m leaving work now,” she said, her words sharp with fear.I ran upstairs, my socks slipping on the steps, and locked myself in the bathroom. The tiles were cold under my feet as I sat against the tub, clutching the phone. I dialed 911, my voice shaking as I told the operator, “Someone’s trying to break into my house. I’m alone, and he’s at the back door.”“Stay where you are, sweetheart. Officers are on their way,” the woman said, her voice calm but urgent.I hugged my knees, listening for any sound. The house was silent now, but that made it worse, like he was waiting. I kept picturing him slipping inside, his hooded figure moving through the kitchen. When the police arrived, I heard their radios crackling downstairs. Mom got home right after, her face pale as she pulled me into a hug.The officers found scratches on the back door, deep gouges in the wood, like someone had tried to pry it open with a tool. They searched the yard and the woods, but the man was gone. “Could’ve been a burglar,” one cop said, but he didn’t sound convinced. They told Mom to get a better lock and left.The next morning, our neighbor, Mr. Johnson, came over. He was old, with a gravelly voice and a limp from an old injury. He sat at our kitchen table, his coffee mug steaming. “Heard about the scare,” he said, looking at Mom. “I’ve seen him a few times, always in black, hood up. He’s quick, slips into the woods before I can get a good look.”Mom’s hands tightened around her mug. “Why didn’t you tell me?”“Didn’t want to worry you without something solid,” he said. “But I’ll watch closer now. Got my rifle ready if he tries anything.”Knowing Mr. Johnson saw him too made it real, but it didn’t make me feel safer. I started checking every window before bed, tugging the curtains tight. I hated being home alone, even for an hour. At school, I’d zone out, thinking about the man, wondering if he’d be there when I got home.When I was 13, it all came to a head. I was in my room one evening, reading a comic book under my desk lamp. A shout from outside made me jump, and I ran to the window. Our other neighbor, Matt, was in his backyard, his shotgun raised. The man in black was sprinting across our yard, his hoodie flapping as he stumbled over a fallen branch. Matt yelled, “Get out of here!” and fired a shot into the air. The sound was deafening, like a thunderclap, and I pressed my hands to my ears.The man scrambled up, limping slightly, and vanished into the woods. Matt stood there, his chest heaving, the gun still in his hands. Later, he came over, his face flushed with anger. “I saw him by your fence, messing with it,” he told Mom in our living room. “I shouted, and he took off. Fired a warning shot to make sure he got the message.”Mom thanked him, her voice shaky. “Do you think he’ll come back?”“Not if he’s smart,” Matt said, but his eyes were hard.The man never came back. The knocks stopped, and the phone stayed quiet. The police never found him, and we never learned who he was or why he kept coming to our house. Maybe he was a drifter, maybe something worse. All I know is he left a mark on me. Even now, years later, I can’t sit in the backyard without feeling like eyes are on me. I check the locks every night, sometimes three times, running my fingers over the bolts to be sure. I don’t sleep with my door open anymore, but I still listen for sounds in the dark, waiting for a knock or a rattle that might bring it all back. That man, whoever he was, took something from me—a piece of safety I’ll never get back.

  


# ""The Garden She Never Got to Plant"":

I trudged up the porch steps after my night shift at the factory, my boots heavy, my body aching from hours on my feet. The house was silent, no clatter of dishes or hum of Lisa’s morning routine. Usually, she’d be in the kitchen, pouring coffee, or the boys, Jacob and Shane, would be bickering over who got the last of the cereal. But today, nothing. Just an eerie quiet that made my skin prickle.“Lisa?” I called, pushing the front door open. My voice bounced off the walls, unanswered. The kitchen was empty, no coffee brewing, no dishes in the sink. I checked the living room, the couch untouched, no sign of her morning crossword. My heart started to thud. I climbed the stairs, two at a time, to our bedroom. The bed was made, sheets tucked tight, like no one had slept there. “Jacob? Shane?” I shouted, but the house swallowed my words.A gnawing fear settled in my gut. Something was wrong, terribly wrong. I remembered Lisa’s mom, Martha, lived next door, just across the narrow strip of grass separating our yards. Maybe they were there. I jogged over, my work boots crunching on the gravel path, and pounded on her door. Martha opened it, her face pale, eyes rimmed red like she’d been crying. “Oh, thank goodness you’re here,” she said, her voice trembling as she pulled me inside. “The boys are safe, but Lisa… she’s gone.”“Gone?” I gripped the doorframe, my knees weak. “What happened?”Martha’s hands shook as she gestured to the couch where Jacob and Shane sat, huddled together. “Last night, around three in the morning, Jacob woke up to screams. He looked in Lisa’s room and saw a man in a black helmet—like for snowmobiling—fighting with her. He grabbed Shane and ran here. I called the police right away, but they’ve been searching and… nothing.”My chest tightened, like someone was squeezing my lungs. “What did the police say?”“They took statements, searched the house, the yard, even the woods out back. But no sign of her.” Martha’s voice cracked. “Jacob’s blaming himself. He keeps saying he should’ve done more.”I crossed the room to the boys. Jacob, twelve, stared at the floor, his hands clenched into fists. Shane, only six, clung to his brother, his face streaked with tears. I knelt down, my voice soft. “Jacob, tell me what you saw.”He swallowed hard, his eyes darting to mine, then away. “I heard Mom screaming. It woke me up. I ran to her room, and there was this guy… he had a black helmet on, all shiny, like for snowmobiling. He was holding her down on the bed. She was kicking, trying to get free. I wanted to help, but he was big, and I… I got scared. I grabbed Shane, and we ran out the back door to Grandma’s.”My throat burned. I pulled them both into a hug, their small bodies trembling against me. “You did the right thing, Jacob. You kept Shane safe. We’ll find her, I promise.” But even as I said it, fear coiled tighter inside me. Lisa was strong, a fighter, but against a man like that? I pushed the thought away.The police came back that morning, their radios crackling as they set up a command post in our driveway. Neighbors and friends showed up, faces grim, offering to help search. We spread out, combing the woods behind the house, the fields stretching toward the highway, the ditches along the road. Every hour that passed without a sign of Lisa felt like a weight pressing down on me. I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, my mind replaying Jacob’s words, picturing Lisa struggling, her screams echoing in the dark.By the second day, my hope was fraying. I walked the same paths over and over, calling her name until my voice grew hoarse. Volunteers moved slower now, their eyes heavy with pity. I ended up in our backyard again, near the fence line where the grass gave way to the open field. It was a spot Lisa loved, where she’d planned to plant a garden, maybe some roses. I stopped, my eyes catching on a patch of ground. The grass was flattened, the dirt loose, like someone had raked it over. I’d noticed it yesterday but thought it was Lisa’s doing, maybe prepping the soil. Now, it looked wrong—too smooth, too deliberate.I crouched, running my hand over the dirt. It felt soft, freshly turned. My pulse quickened. I waved over an officer, a young guy named Tom who’d been kind to the boys. “Hey, Tom, come look at this,” I said, my voice tight. “This ground… it doesn’t look right.”He knelt beside me, squinting at the patch. “You’re right. It’s disturbed. Could be nothing, but…” He grabbed a shovel from his patrol car. “Let’s dig a little, see what’s here.”We started slow, careful, each scoop of dirt making my stomach churn. The shovel scraped against something hard, not a rock, something softer. Tom stopped, his eyes meeting mine. “Keep going,” I whispered, my voice barely there. He dug again, and then I saw it—a pale hand, fingers curled, sticking out of the earth like a claw reaching for air.I screamed, stumbling back, my heart slamming against my ribs. “No, no, no…” I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think. Tom shouted into his radio, “We’ve got something! Backyard, now!” More officers ran over, their boots pounding the grass. They took over, digging faster, uncovering plastic sheeting, then a shape wrapped tight. Duct tape bound her wrists, her ankles. A pillowcase covered her head, taped shut over her mouth.One of the officers, a woman with steady hands, knelt and carefully cut the tape, peeling back the pillowcase. Lisa’s face appeared, pale, her eyes closed, her lips still. I fell to my knees, a sob ripping through me. She looked peaceful, but I knew the terror she’d felt, the fight she’d put up. My wife, buried in our own backyard, where we’d watched the boys chase fireflies, where we’d laughed under the stars.The next hours were a haze. Police taped off the yard, yellow lines crisscrossing the grass. Forensic teams arrived, snapping photos, collecting dirt samples, bagging the plastic and tape. I sat on Martha’s porch, staring at our house, now a crime scene. I had to tell the boys, but how? Jacob was old enough to understand, but Shane… I couldn’t break his world like that.I went inside, my legs heavy. Jacob looked up, his eyes searching mine. “Did you find her?” he asked, his voice small.I sat between them, pulling them close. “Boys, I… Mom’s not coming back.” My voice broke. “They found her… in the yard. She’s gone.”Jacob’s face crumpled, tears spilling. “It’s my fault. I should’ve stopped him.”“No,” I said, gripping his shoulders. “You did everything you could. This isn’t on you.”Shane just stared, his small hands clutching my shirt. “Where’s Mommy now?”I swallowed hard, tears burning my eyes. “She’s in a better place, buddy. She’s watching over you.” The words felt like a lie, but I didn’t know what else to say.Later, the lead detective pulled me aside. “We’ve got a suspect,” he said. “Frank Spagnola, Lisa’s ex. Jacob’s dad. We found his DNA under her fingernails. She fought hard. We’re bringing him in now.”I nodded, numb. Frank. I’d always known he was trouble, his temper flaring during their custody fights over Jacob. Lisa had been scared of him, said he’d threatened her before, but I never thought… not this. They told me he’d worn that snowmobile helmet to hide his face, planned it all, thinking he could bury her and walk away. The police found tools in his truck, dirt matching our backyard, and fibers from the plastic wrap.Frank was convicted, sentenced to life without parole. But no court could undo what he’d done. Our home, our sanctuary, was ruined. The backyard, where we’d built a swing set, where Lisa had dreamed of her garden, was a grave now. We moved a month later, to a small apartment far from that place. The boys cried every night, and I couldn’t sleep, haunted by that pale hand in the dirt, by Lisa’s face under that pillowcase.Even now, years later, I check the ground wherever I walk, afraid of what’s beneath. The fear never leaves, not really. It’s in every shadow, every quiet moment, a reminder of the horror we found in our own backyard.

  


# ""The Man Behind the Shed"":

I’ve always cherished my backyard, a modest rectangle of grass and garden beds tucked behind our house in Riverside, California. It was my sanctuary, where I’d spend hours tending to my vegetable patch, pruning roses, or just sitting on the old wooden bench with a coffee, listening to the world slow down. But a few years ago, something happened there that turned my haven into a place of dread. This isn’t some spooky tale with ghosts—it’s real, raw, and it still haunts me every time I step outside.My wife, Lisa, never liked me lingering out there after dark. She’d stand at the back door, arms crossed, her voice tight with worry. “You’re out there too long,” she’d say. “It’s creepy at night, with all those noises.” I’d brush it off with a chuckle. “It’s just the neighbor’s cat or a coyote sniffing around,” I’d reply, waving her concern away. “Nothing’s going to happen.” But our neighbor, Tom, had mentioned something unsettling a while back. He’d leaned over the fence one afternoon, his brow furrowed. “I saw some guy cutting through your yard a couple weeks ago,” he said. “Wore a dark hoodie, looked like he was in a rush.” I shrugged, figuring it was a teenager taking a shortcut to the street behind us. “Probably just kids,” I told him, but his words stuck with me more than I admitted.About a month before that night, I started noticing odd things. My garden tools—a rake, a trowel—weren’t where I’d left them. I found them propped against the shed or lying in the grass, as if someone had picked them up and set them down carelessly. Then there were footprints in the soft dirt near the back fence, deep and wide, definitely not mine or Lisa’s. They were too big for an animal, too. I told myself it was nothing serious—maybe a delivery guy had wandered back there, or a neighbor’s dog had gotten loose and some guy chased after it. But Lisa wasn’t so sure. “You need to lock the shed,” she said one evening, her voice sharp as she stirred a pot on the stove. “And for heaven’s sake, stop leaving the gate unlatched. Anyone could walk in.” I nodded, promising to be more careful, but I didn’t follow through. I didn’t want to believe anything was wrong.The night it happened, I was out in the backyard late, around 10 p.m., fixing a loose board on the wooden fence that separated our yard from the alley behind. The fence had been wobbling for weeks, and I wanted to nail it down before it fell over. I had my flashlight propped on the bench, its beam casting a pale glow across the grass, and a small toolbox at my feet. The only sounds were the rhythmic tap of my hammer and the occasional hum of a car passing on the street out front. I was focused, sweat beading on my forehead, when I heard a faint rustle from the bushes near the shed. I paused, hammer mid-air, my ears straining. “Hello?” I called softly, my voice sounding small in the darkness. Silence answered, and I shook my head, muttering to myself. “Just a raccoon,” I said, and went back to hammering.But then it came again—louder, deliberate, like dry leaves crunching under a slow, careful step. My stomach knotted, and I set the hammer down, my hand trembling slightly. I grabbed the flashlight, its beam wobbling as I pointed it toward the shed. The bushes were still, their shadows jagged in the light. “Who’s there?” I said, louder now, trying to sound bold. Nothing moved, but the hair on my neck stood up. I felt it—someone watching me, their gaze heavy, like a weight pressing against my back. My heart started to thud, each beat loud in my ears. I took a step backward, my sneakers scuffing the grass, and called out, “Lisa! Can you come out here?”The back door creaked open, and Lisa stepped onto the porch, her silhouette framed by the kitchen light. “What’s going on?” she asked, her voice edged with irritation. She was in her pajamas, a mug of tea in her hand. “I heard something by the shed,” I said, keeping my eyes on the bushes. “It’s not an animal.” She squinted into the dark, her expression shifting to worry. “You’re freaking me out,” she said. “Come inside, now.” I wanted to, but I needed to know what was out there. “Just wait,” I told her, picking up a shovel that was leaning against the house. Its handle felt solid in my hands, grounding me.Then came a loud snap—a branch breaking under weight. Lisa gasped, and I nearly dropped the flashlight. “That’s no raccoon,” I whispered, my mouth dry. She stepped off the porch, her voice rising. “I’m calling the police!” But I held up a hand, signaling her to stay quiet. “Let me check first,” I said, though my legs felt like jelly. I crept toward the shed, shovel raised like a baseball bat, flashlight sweeping the yard. Each step was agony, my pulse hammering in my throat. The shed loomed closer, its weathered wood barely visible in the dim light. The bushes beside it were thick, a tangle of leaves that could hide anything—or anyone.Another rustle, sharp and close, made me stop dead. “Show yourself!” I shouted, my voice cracking with fear. The beam of my flashlight danced across the bushes, and then I saw it—movement, low to the ground. My breath caught as a figure rose slowly from behind the shed. It was a man, thin and hunched, wearing a dark jacket with the hood pulled up. His face was shadowed, but his eyes glinted in the light, cold and unblinking, like a predator’s. In his right hand, something metallic caught the beam—a knife, its blade maybe six inches long. My blood turned to ice. Time seemed to slow, every detail burning into my mind: the dirt smudged on his jacket, the way his fingers twitched around the knife’s handle, the faint rasp of his breathing.“Get out of my yard!” I yelled, gripping the shovel so hard my knuckles ached. My voice sounded braver than I felt. Lisa screamed from the porch, her mug shattering on the ground. “I’m calling 911!” she shouted, fumbling for her phone. The man’s head jerked toward her, then back to me. For a heartbeat, I was sure he’d lunge, that blade flashing toward me. I braced myself, shovel raised, my legs trembling. But instead, he moved fast, bolting toward the fence like a startled animal. He crashed through the bushes, leaves tearing, and scrambled over the wooden slats, his boots thudding as he landed in the alley.I ran after him, adrenaline flooding my veins, but I stopped at the fence, my chest heaving. He was gone, swallowed by the darkness. I staggered back to the porch, my hands shaking so bad I dropped the shovel. Lisa was already on the phone, her voice high and frantic. “Yes, a man in our backyard! He had a knife! Please, hurry!” She grabbed my arm, pulling me inside. “Are you okay?” she asked, her eyes wide with panic. I nodded, but I was far from okay. My mind kept replaying those eyes, that knife, the way he’d stood there, watching me. I locked the door, my fingers fumbling with the bolt, and sank into a chair, my legs weak.The police arrived about ten minutes later, their sirens cutting through the night. Two officers, one tall with a notepad, the other shorter with a flashlight, stepped into the yard. “Show us where he was,” the tall one said, his tone calm but serious. I led them to the shed, pointing out the crushed leaves, the footprints in the dirt, the broken branch. “He was hiding right here,” I said, my voice still shaky. The shorter officer knelt, shining his light on the ground. “Fresh tracks,” he said. “Looks like he was here a while, maybe watching the house.” My stomach lurched at the thought. “You’re lucky he ran,” the tall officer added, glancing at me. “Guy like that, with a knife? Could’ve been bad.”They searched the alley and the neighbor’s yard but found no sign of him. “Keep your doors and windows locked,” the shorter officer said as they left. “Call us immediately if you see anything else.” Lisa nodded, her face pale. “We will,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. That night, we didn’t sleep. We sat in the living room, lights on, jumping at every creak of the house. Lisa held my hand, her grip tight. “Why didn’t you listen to me?” she asked, tears in her eyes. “He could’ve killed you.” I swallowed hard, guilt twisting in my chest. “I didn’t think it was real,” I said. “I thought I was safe out there.”The next morning, Tom came over, his face grim. “I heard what happened,” he said, standing at our front door. “That’s the same guy I saw before, I’m sure of it. He’s been lurking around the block for weeks.” My heart sank. Later that day, the police called with more details. The man matched the description of someone tied to a string of break-ins in our area. He’d been spotted watching homes, sometimes hiding in yards or garages, waiting for a chance to slip inside. One neighbor had woken up to find him standing in her kitchen, knife in hand, before he fled. They caught him a week later, hiding in a shed three blocks away, still carrying that knife.We installed a security system the next day—motion lights, cameras, the works. I locked the shed, fixed the gate, and stopped going to the backyard at night. But the fear lingers. I can’t look at the shed without picturing him crouched there, his eyes locked on me. I hear that rustle in the bushes, even when it’s just the wind. My backyard, once my refuge, feels tainted, like a place where danger hides, waiting for me to let my guard down again. I know he’s gone, locked away, but those moments in the dark changed me. I don’t feel safe anymore, not even in my own home.",1,1749967442.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

He had a five o’clock shadow across his strong jaw and a big smile on his face that matched my own. “Hip hip,” he mumbled, his lips..","Chapter 1  
 I heard the alarm beep behind me but it quickly cancelled so I didn’t bother to open my eyes. I was just drifting back into blissful sleep again when I became aware of someone singing quietly in my ear, and fingers trailing up and down my side, tickling my skin. I couldn’t help the goofy grin that stretched across my face.  “. . . to you. Happy birthday, dear Maisie. Happy birthday,” a soft kiss was planted on the side of my neck making me draw in a ragged breath, “to you.  I opened my eyes and half rolled over to see Luke lying against my back. His gorgeous face was merely inches away, and his big brown eyes were locked onto mine. His dark brown hair was messy and sticking out at all angles, but it suited him like that, it made him look a little rough and ready. He had a five o’clock shadow across his strong jaw and a big smile on his face that matched my own.  “Hip hip,” he mumbled, his lips almost touching mine.  “Hooray?” I asked, giggling.  He laughed too and finally pressed his soft lips to mine. I smiled against his mouth and wrapped my arm around his neck, pulling him closer to me as he sucked my bottom lip into his mouth, nibbling on it gently. I opened my mouth, praying I didn’t have morning breath, but knowing Luke he wouldn’t even care if I did.  I lost myself in the bliss of Luke’s kissing, silently wondering, as I had done hundreds of times, just what it was that he saw in me. Out of all the girls he could have chosen, he chose me, and I’d never understand it. His hand traced up my stomach as he kissed me deeply, making my toes curl as my body got so excited that I could barely think about anything other than his taste and the feel of his fingertips trailing over my body. Finally, he pulled away and kissed the tip of my nose.  “Good morning,” I mumbled, my voice barely above a whisper because of just waking up.  “Good morning, birthday girl,” he answered. “You know, I’ll never get used to how beautiful you look in the morning. The no make-up and messy bed hair really does it for me. So perfect,” he whispered, gripping my hip and pulling me closer to him again.  
  
  I smiled, tracing my fingers across his broad shoulders. “You’re just saying that to get into my pants. ”  
  
  He laughed and brushed his nose against mine. “Been there. Done that. You’re wearing my T-shirt,” he replied, grinning proudly as he tugged on the bottom of his T-shirt that I’d slept in.  
  
  I giggled and bit my lip. I’d had a year and seven months with him, and he still managed to make me feel like a giddy little girl, it was a little crazy really. “Whatever, Luke. ” I pulled his mouth to mine again as I rolled my eyes playfully.  
  
  He pulled back as I tried to deepen the kiss. “How about I give you your present now?” he offered, stroking the side of my face. The way he was looking at me made my face heat up; if I didn’t feel exactly the same about him then the soft, tender way he was looking at me would scare me. We were only eighteen, but I knew this was him, this was the guy, the one, and the look on his face told me that he was thinking exactly the same thing about me.  
  
  “Does your present involve me moaning your name?” I asked, raking my eyes over his body slowly, drinking in every inch of his sculpted chest, the V line that led down to the waistband of his black boxers that he was wearing.  
  
  He laughed wickedly. “The one I bought doesn’t, but if you want I’ll give you that one after. ”  
  
  I sighed as I thought about it, tracing one finger across his scratchy jaw line, imagining what it would feel like tickling my body. “Definitely,” I purred, nodding enthusiastically.  
  
  He grinned and immediately jumped out of the bed, and again I was struck by how lucky I was that this boy wanted me. Luke Hannigan was a jock, very popular at our school, and although he could be a jerk when he wanted to, he was the most adorable boyfriend in the world. Why he chose me I still didn’t understand. I wasn’t beautiful, I wasn’t popular, if anything I was a little nerdy. I took my school work seriously; I didn’t wear short shirts or slutty tops and jump on the sidelines cheering him on while he played football. I preferred to go without make-up and pull my hair up into a messy topknot, slob around in sweats and a T-shirt, than wear high heels and tank tops. I would rather go camping and wake up early so I could go hiking and watch the sun rise than stay in a spa and get a manicure. On paper Luke and I were total opposites. When we first got together people thought he was crazy for going for a nerdy girl like me. Thankfully he did though and I couldn’t be happier about it.  
  
  He came sauntering back over to the bed and dropped down next to me, making me giggle as he caught me looking at his body. His eyebrow rose knowingly as he smirked at me. He held out his hand, revealing a little box about the size of his palm. “Happy eighteenth birthday, baby,” he whispered.  
  
  I gulped and took the box from his hand. “Thanks. I hope you didn’t go crazy,” I muttered, looking at him gratefully. He smiled and shook his head as I tore at the shiny red paper he’d wrapped it in, eager to see what he’d bought me. When I got to the soft black velvet box, I chewed on my lip. My pulse drummed in my ears now that I knew it was jewellery and something I could keep and treasure. I smiled and pulled open the lid, gasping when I saw what he’d bought. Inside the box was an oval gold locket on a delicate gold chain. There was a swirly pattern on the front, with a little diamond set in the middle. It was beautiful.  
  
  “Luke, this is-” I gasped, not having the words to describe the exquisite thing he’d bought me.  
  
  He smiled and took the box out of my hand, flipping the locket over and handing it back to me again. I looked down at it and my heart melted into a puddle. He’d had it engraved on the back.  
  
  ‘True love lasts for always,  
  
  Yours forever,  
  
  Luke x’  
  
  My eyes filled with tears. I still couldn’t think of anything to say. I had no words to describe how incredible this present was and how special it made me feel that he had gone out and chosen something this beautiful, just for me. “Thank you, it’s…” I looked at him in awe, and he kissed me lightly.  
  
  “You’re welcome,” he whispered against my lips. “You like it though, really? If not then I’ll buy you something else. ” He seemed a little worried about his choice.  
  
  I shook my head fiercely and clutched the little box to my chest protectively. “I love it, and I love you,” I said honestly.  
  
  He grinned. “I love you too, Maisie. ” He pointed at the box I was holding for dear life. “I couldn’t find a nice picture of us to put in it that was small enough. We’ll have to get one photoshopped or something. ”  
  
  I grinned and gripped the locket, releasing the little catch to open it, only to find a badly cut out photo of us had been placed inside. My heart swelled because of the effort he went to. He must have sorted through hundreds of photos just to find one that semi fitted in there, but the top of his head was cut off, as my was chin.  
  
  “I’ll sort something out,” I confirmed. “Put it on for me?” I requested, holding the box out for him. I watched as he pulled the delicate necklace from the box, I held my hair up over one shoulder and giggled as the cold locket touched my chest. When he was done, I gripped it in my hand and looked back at him, smiling smugly that he was mine. “How about the other present now?” I flirted, raising my eyebrows, smiling seductively.  
  
  He grinned and literally pounced on me, making me giggle and fall back into the pillows. Things were getting hot when suddenly there was a knock on the door. I squealed and pushed him off of me, at the same time that he jumped back, shocked, and fell on his butt out of the bed, groaning as his head hit the floor.  
  
  I bit my lip and looked at him worriedly. “You okay?”  
  
  The do  
or opened and I yanked the covers up to my shoulders, covering the fact that Luke had taken his shirt off of me seconds before the interruption. In walked my mom with a tray in her hands and a big smile on her face. I flicked my eyes to the floor on the other side of the bed, noticing that Luke had laid back, hiding himself from view as my mom walked in.  
  
  “Morning, happy birthday!” she chirped, completely oblivious that I’d snuck my boyfriend into the house while everyone was asleep last night.  
  
  “Hi, er… Thanks?” I muttered, trying not to blush.  
  
  “Are you getting up anytime soon? I’m making a birthday breakfast,” she offered, grinning happily. I smiled and nodded enthusiastically. Birthday breakfasts were the best, my mom made literally anything we wanted. I had the same every year - blueberry pancakes with whipped cream. She made my goofy twin brother a fried meat filled mess, and my dad usually went for chocolate chip pancakes, but Mom had to burn his for some reason, he was a little weird like that.  
  
  “Heck yeah! I’m just gonna, er…” I grasped wildly for some excuse that would give me a few minutes in my room so that Luke could get dressed and I could sneak him back out of the front door.  
  
  She smirked at me and put the tray down on my dresser. “I made you a coffee. Breakfast will be done in about fifteen minutes so that’ll give you time to drink it,” she said, shrugging, still grinning. “And Luke, next time you sneak in, make sure you park your car more than two houses away,” she teased, smirking at the empty space where he was hiding down beside the bed.  
  
  My mouth dropped open in shock as Luke sat up from where he was, looking at her guiltily, rubbing the back of his neck. “Yeah, sorry about that, Riley,” he muttered, wincing. I just sat there blushing as my mom shook her head and rolled her eyes.  
  
  “Amateurs,” she teased. “Don’t let Clay or Alex catch you in here, you know they’ll hurt you,” she joked, laughing to herself.  
  
  I giggled, and Luke nodded quickly. That was true, my dad and brother wouldn’t take too kindly to the fact that my boyfriend had secretly spent the night here. “I won’t, thanks,” Luke agreed sheepishly.  
  
  She smiled and walked back towards the door again. “I made you a coffee too, Luke. ” She waved her hand at the tray dismissively.When she closed the door Luke and I looked at each other and burst out laughing. He pushed me down into the bed and pulled the covers over our heads, pressing his almost n\*\*ed body against mine as he grinned at me in the semidarkness. “Your mom is so cool,” he said, kissing my cheek.  
  
  I nodded in agreement. I definitely had the best mom going, she was easy to talk to, supportive and never judged me for anything. She completely understood my decision to sleep with Luke a year ago and took me to go and get on the pill when I was ready to take the next step. She’d made everything easier for me, and I loved her for it. Luke wasn’t allowed to stay over, but I usually snuck him in for special occasions like valentine’s day or birthdays.  
  
  I was definitely lucky when it came to my parents, my dad was awesome too, but so overprotective that it was annoying sometimes. But I guess I could understand that, I was his little girl after all, and it mostly worked out in my favour too considering I was a total daddy’s girl and got spoilt rotten most of the time.  
  
  “You’d better get dressed and leave before my dad catches you in here though,” I suggested, giggling as he flinched. My dad didn’t have a particular problem with Luke, he would probably treat any boyfriend I had the same; he liked to test him and tease him to make sure he wasn’t going to run away and hurt me. You’d think that after a year and seven months that he’d finally give up and accept that Luke wasn’t going anywhere though.  
  
  “Yeah, good idea. ”  
  
  He kissed me one more time and then pushed himself out of the bed looking a little reluctant to leave. I smiled and watched as he pulled his jeans on, looking around for his T-shirt that he’d taken off of me and thrown somewhere in a fit of passion. I spotted it on the sideboard on the other side of the room and giggled as I nodded to it. He grinned and slipped it on, before reaching for my hand and pulling me out of the bed so I could get dressed too.  
  
  While I threw on some pyjamas, I could feel his eyes on me. “You know, I think you look even hotter at eighteen than you did at seventeen,” he mused as I pushed my arms into my robe.  
  
  I laughed and slapped his chest as he went to wrap his arms around me again. “Come on, let’s get you out of here,” I suggested, taking his hand and heading towards my bedroom door. Easing the door open, I stuck my head out, looking everywhere to make sure the coast was clear. Lucky for me my bedroom was right at the top of the stairs and the front door was at the bottom. He just had to get down thirteen steps, cross the short entranceway, and then we were home free.  
  
  When I saw no one, I grabbed his hand and pulled him out of the room, both of us almost sprinting down the stairs. Just as I got to the bottom step, I saw a blond head appear in the doorway of the kitchen. I held my breath, skidding to a halt and Luke slammed into me from behind because I’d stopped so suddenly. His arm snaked around my waist quickly to stop me from falling on my butt as we both looked up with wide eyes.  
  
  Oh no, please be Alex and not Dad!  
  
  Of course, I wasn’t that lucky, it was my dad - but he hadn’t noticed me because he was studying the newspaper as he was walking through the door. My mom walked up behind him, smiling, when suddenly her eyes widened as she must have seen Luke standing behind me. I silently begged her for help with my eyes. Almost immediately she grabbed my dad’s hand, giving it a little tug. He turned around to face her, turning his back on us as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. I gulped, a little grossed out. I should have been used to it by now though, they were always kissing like loved up teenagers when they thought they were alone. Unfortunately, parent kissing didn’t get easier to witness no matter how many times you were subjected to it.  
  
  I was stuck on the spot, wondering if she was going to take him back into the kitchen so I could get the front door open and get Luke out, or if she meant for me to get him out now while they were kissing.  
  
  They broke the kiss and Dad laughed. “What was that for, Riley Bear?” he asked, wrapping his arms around her.  
  
  “Just wanted to kiss you, that’s all,” Mom replied. She pointed her finger forcefully at the front door a couple of times behind my dad’s head, signalling for me to move. Luke squeezed my hand and we both crept forward towards the door, counting the steps.  
  
  “And you didn’t get enough of that this morning?” my dad teased, causing my mom giggle.  
  
  “Eww!” I hissed, cringing at the thought of what that meant. Luke’s hand clapped over my mouth, pushing me gently, making me walk faster to the door.  
  
  More sounds of kissing started from behind me again, and I shuddered. When I made the final step to the door, I opened it slowly, being as quiet as possible. Luke slipped through and I blew him a kiss as he squeezed my hand as a goodbye. He’d be back in a little while anyway to pick me up for school, but he had just really wanted to stay over so he could be the first person I saw when I woke up on my birthday. He’d always been adorable like that. I sighed dreamily and closed the door, forgetting to be as quiet as I should have been.  
  
  “Hey, what are you doing?”  
  
  I gulped at the sound of my dad’s voice. “Er, I was going to, um… get the paper for you?” I offered weakly.  
  
  He laughed and held the up newspaper in his hand. “I got it, sweetie, but thanks,” he chirped as he came bounding over and pulled me into a bone crushing hug. “Happy birthday! Oh man, my little girl a legal adult. ” He shook his head, looking at me in awe.  
  
  I laughed and nodded. “Yep, so can I get a tattoo?” I asked, only half joking. If he said yes I was definitely getting one today.  
  
  He raised one eyebrow at me. “No,” was all he said, and I couldn’t help but smile. He grinned happily at me as he tugged me towards the kitchen and the smell of deliciousness that wafted through the house. “So, think you’ll get anything nice for your eighteenth?”  
  
  I grinned, thinking about the locket that was hanging around my neck. “I guess I’ll have to wait and see if the birthday fairy has been,” I joked, squeezing my arm around his waist. That was something he used to tell me and my twin brother, Alex, when we were younger and were too excited to go to sleep the night before our birthday, that if we didn’t go to sleep then the birthday fairy wouldn’t come. When we stepped into the kitchen I laughed as I took in the array of pink and blue balloons, the happy 18th banners, and the presents scattered over the dining table. “Well the birthday fairy’s been in here!”  
  
  My dad grinned, and I chewed on my lip excitedly. Today was going to be a great day, sure I was going to school, but I’d get to hang out with Luke at lunchtime. Tonight we were all going out for family dinner; both sets of my grandparents were coming too. I’d managed to convince my parents that Luke needed to come with us because he was part of my ‘extended family’. Then tomorrow was Friday, which meant that Luke was taking me to an all ages night at a club to celebrate my birthday. Saturday night would be even better though, because on Saturday Luke and I were going camping near the lake, just the two of us. I sighed contentedly. My life was just perfect, and eighteen was definitely going to be my year.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  I dressed in my usual casual attire of jeans and a plain fitted T-shirt, scraping my long brown hair back into a ponytail, the same as every other day. As usual, I didn’t bother with any make-up. I wasn’t exactly a girlie girl so things like that didn’t happen in my normal dressing routine. I skipped back down the stairs and stopped when I heard Luke’s voice in the kitchen. He was talking to my dad.  
  
  “Clay, it’s only camping, we’ve been before and you didn’t mind,” he stated.  
  
  I heard a heavy sigh. “Yeah, but Alex went then too, and other friends. All I’m saying is that you’d better take care of her. I don’t like the idea of you two being alone together all night, but I guess I need to accept that she’s an adult now. ” Dad’s voice was a little gruff as he spoke.  
  
  “Honestly, you don’t have anything to worry about. I’ll always take care of her  
,” Luke answered. He sounded extremely exasperated so I wondered how long my dad had been grilling him for. I hadn’t heard him arrive so for all I knew he could have been subjected to the inquisition the whole time I was showering and dressing for school. Luke certainly put up with a lot from my dad, but other than the occasional threats and stuff they got on great.  
  
  “Look, it’s just that you two are moving on so fast, what with the whole applying for the same colleges thing… I just don’t want any mistakes to mess up your futures. You understand what I’m saying?”  
  
  “Yeah, of course. Maisie and I are always really responsible like that,” Luke replied easily, as if talking to my dad about our sex life wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. “I know we’re young but you knew you were in love at our age, you and Riley were already married by the time you were our age. ”  
  
  “Riley and I are different, I’d known her my whole life,” my dad countered defensively.  
  
  “And I’ve known Maisie since we were thirteen. ”  
  
  I decided it was time to put an end to this conversation before my dad started getting annoyed or anything. He honestly did like Luke, but he just hated the thought of his little girl growing up. He never seemed to mind Alex going to parties or hooking up with girls all the time, but a serious boyfriend for his little girl was something entirely different.  
  
  I cleared my throat as I walked around the corner, gaining their attention immediately. “I’m ready to go whenever you’re done with this little man-to-man chat,” I joked, waving my hand between the two of them.  
  
  Luke smirked at me and my dad grinned sheepishly, like he’d been caught in the act. “I was just telling Luke about the potential bear threat for Saturday night. Maybe you should just stay home to be on the safe side?” Dad suggested, laughing quietly.  
  
  I shrugged. “We’ll take anti bear spray,” I joked, playing along.  
  
  Luke laughed and stood up from the stool he was perched on, coming over and draping his arm across my shoulders. “Happy birthday,” he whispered, kissing the side of my head as he held up a bunch of daisies. That was his flower of choice for me. He always bought them because when we first started dating I’d joked and told him they were my favourite because they rhymed with my name. He’d since learned that they weren’t my favourites, but it kind of stuck, so daisies were his thing now.

1lbt2ls,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1lbt2ls/he_told_his_ex_i_wasnt_the_oneand_i_married_him/,He told his ex I wasn't the one...and I married him anyway.,"   I've been with my husband for 14 years, (married for 5) and we have 2 kids. I feel like I've ""woken up and smelled the coffee"" and realized what I deserve and that it's not too late for me to leave him. And I feel like if I list even SOME of the things he's done, people will agree he's been a POS. We started dating when we were 19/20 and I was much more insecure at the time and had never had much attention from boys. Here's a few of the things that I'm fairly certain would have people telling me to leave...
     Our relationship had issues from the very start, primarily to do with ex. Early on I had found texts on his phone telling his ex and a friend that was a girl that he saw me as more of a friend and didn't want to hurt me. But still I stayed...I continued to find message to/from his ex for the first 6 years of our relationship, often with messages implying that they missed each other. But still I stayed.... One of the last time I found emails with his ex he flat out told her I was not the one. And still I stayed AND married him years later. Not exactly a fairy tale wedding when you're remembering that at the back of your mind. This was the last proof of messaging with her I ever found... but I had also deleted and blocked her contact info. We talked about each and everyone of the discoveries I made, the first times him being apologetic to later times him being frustrated that I had snooped.
    After we had our first daughter, I found an email replying to some type of sex solicitation email (the type that usually look like junk mail) with him responding 'how does this work?"". When I brought it up, we fought and the argument basically ended with him saying it was my fault because I wasn't ""putting out"" as much anymore...with a newborn baby. But he claims nothing happened and he ""wouldn't do that to our family"". 
    When pregnant with my second, I was much more sick and tired and would often need to nap in the afternoon before work - he gave me trouble for this.
   I also recently found account info for Ashley Madison on his old old laptop (basically there was a folder that had all the saved login credentials your computer remembers for you). The login didn't work and when I asked about he claims he never used it. 
    We completed a big addition on our house that he basically built himself, while we both worked full time. He built the addition while I took care of the kids and everything else ...went through one of the worst bouts of depression, was on the verge of a mental breakdown because I was so burnt out but he tells me now that he wishes i would have helped more with the renovation... 
   We also had 2 pretty big fights in Dec/Jan that basically felt like the 'switch' that made me thing I'm done with being treated this way. Long stories to explain the fights, they could probably be posts of their own but I was seriously emotionally hurt. When I posted anonymously about our one fight, somebody suggested he was a narcissist - andi was stuck on that for a few months thinking he was a covert narcissist or emotionally ebusive. 
    We did 2 sessions of marriage counselling but wasn't a fan of the therapit because seemed like she tried to find an excuse for his behaviours. 
   And everything just feels worse because I'm a mom and it feels like I carry most of the load of managing our household. I recently came off antidepressants, and I'm almost wondering if I've been on antidepressants to surpress the emotional trauma I've endured on our relationship in order to stay. And think I'm done...ready to leave, which is scary with kids involved.
     There's obviously a lot more stories I could share and many more issues I haven't discussed but with everything you've heard, am I right to leave? I know if my girls told me their partner had done these things, I'd be telling them to leave and that they deserve better.
 
TL;DR:
I've been with my husband for 14 years, and our relationship has been full of emotional betrayal, lies, and emotional neglect — from ongoing messages with his ex, shady online behavior (like Ashley Madison and sex solicitation emails), to blaming me postpartum and during pregnancy. I've carried the emotional and physical weight of our family and home while feeling increasingly broken down. Now that I'm off antidepressants, I realize I may have been numbing myself to survive the relationship. I'm scared, but I think I'm finally ready to leave — especially for the sake of showing my daughters what self-respect looks like.

1lbt1tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lbt1tu/i_cant_stand_my_call_centre_job_and_lazy_mother/,I can't stand my call centre job and lazy mother,"I work at a call centre for 2 years. We never had back to back calls. We had like 27 calls a day because I worked in luxury department. Now it's 70 calls a day back to back and I'm starting to hate my job. They want me to be consistent on every call and have a perfect call. I am exhausted sometimes I ask the guest the same question again because I wasn't paying attention the first time. I even use to dose off on calls during Ramadan because I was fasting all day and had no energy. Luckily I wasn't caught. That was the hardest month for me because u speak all day and cannot drink anything. Anyway, it's 70 calls a day back to back of guests wasting my time and not booking a room or they call and keep me on the phone for 30 min and they just end up booking it on their phone. We have a sales target so we offer to book it for the guest but they would say they're almost done. 

We also can't take too many toilet breaks or just a quick breaks because they add it up and if it's over an hour then we lose our commission as it disqualifies us from getting it. Also absence disqualifies you. If you're absent one day then you only qualify for half of your commission and if you stay absent for 2 days then you get no commission at all. So if you're sick and u want to get commission then you will have to use your annual leave. Many times I sit at my desk with a runny nose and I tend to get very sick. The only time I stayed absent was when I started vomiting at work. Also when you're 18 seconds over break. You are shamed and your time is screenshotted and sent on the group. 18 seconds! Once someone logged in 15 seconds late and was shamed. I don't know what to do anymore. 

Back to Back calls exhausts me. I come home and have to cook because my mother refuses to cook. Most times I immediately fall asleep. I lost motivation to lose weight, I live on sugar energy drinks, coffee and sandwiches/noodles. I don't have time to cook and my mom won't help me. I sleep and wake up and it's time to work again. I hate coaching because they are forever telling me on what I can improve. I have to do a million things on the calls. Gosh it's probably like 30 thinhs or 40 things I have to do. They keep adding more and more and more work on our load. I sigh when calls come through. Sometimes they call 4am in the morning which is sick. Don't Americans wanna sleep???? I'm not even logged in and the calls comes through. 

I'm so tired of speaking to people and I have to have a happy chappy and friendly and welcoming tone for hours, call after call. It's EXHAUSTING!!!!! Plus I have to do a million things nd also build rapport and make conversation otherwise I grt marked down for not taking a genuine interest in the guests plans. Not me. I'm an introvert sorry but I have adapted a lot and learnt how to speak to people over the phone. I got fat and I just feel there is no light at the end of the tunnel. I need this job. I want to move out where my mom is just lazy, financially dependent on me until she gets her pension and also Dependant on me to cook. She does take care of everything else but slowly. House is filthy, clothe unwashed. I am depressed and I am glued to my bed on my off days for two days straight because sleep is an absolute LUXURY! the funniest as when we were invited to chill together as a team on our off days and I said no thank you. I see you guys everyday. My off days are for ME. no other job wants to hire me. Only other call center  with a less salary. 

I am starting to become rude to guests because they're stupid and waste my time. Why would anyone think it's ok to call an 800 number just cos it's free and keep someone on the phone with them for 30 min, wasting their time asking rates amd trying to negotiate rates at a 5 star hotel. Wtf. If u can't afford it then go to a 3 star hotel. I am grateful I have a job but the back to back seems inhumane and I feel like crying and I'm starting to have nightmares because it is PURE HELL. Today I complain3d to my mom how exhausted I am and I had 70 calls the day before. I asked her to cook the potatoes softy so I can make mash for cottage pie because our stove is broken and slow. She knows I come home and relax asap. I came home and the potatoes wasn't boiled.  I used bad language because I am so tired of her excuses. It takes u 5 min to peel it and boil it. She said no the dogs kept her busy. What a lame excuse. It's always someone else's fault. Now I want to move out and get my own place and be at peace and visit my mom once every 2 weeks and slowly drift away because I'm an adult and I can't keep living with her in this way. Now I will need my job more than ever because I will have rent to pay. 

Just felt like sharing my stories as I read a lot of stories and I resonate so much. Omg it's such hell. No time to even take a dip of water. Next. This job shouldn't exist. They should have a 4 to 5 min break before the next call comes in. I am always trying to steal time from the company as much as I can. Even if I walk outside to get some sunlight or walk to the store to get a cool drink. I did ll this and  I was almost over  my 1 hour limit and ALMOST lost my commission! 
The job pays for a lot. Trips abroad, my beauty salon trips, food, clothes, meds.... I am grateful but surely there must be something better. I have a degree which I dot even use. 21 year Olds have higher positions than me and earn more than me. I have warnings on file so I don't qualify for a promotion for the next year. I can't wait to resign. I enjoyed the department when we barely had calls. We'll I didn't like the great amount of time of availability because I like to be busy but at least 5 min between calls. 10 if we lucky. It's important to also keep snacking so imagine. I gained like 10kg since working here. How do I find the motivation to work out after back to back calls exhausting me, a mother who won't cook me a meal.... the last time I had a home cooked meal was 3 weeks ago or a month ago. I live on take aways or quick bites.  I tend to get more hungry now because I speak a lot and it takes too much of my energy to do this job. I feel like a slave with no rights. 

I earn 10 500. Rent wil be 5500 for a not a nice place. I wil only be able to affford for rent and food if I move. No luxuries and will not be able to eat take ours twice in a month. The above currency is in my country's currency so its not a lot as groceries cost 3000. Transport 500. Other expenses 2000. I feel I am stuck. Should I move to get away from mom or stay and have the extra money? Should I rather just book an airbnb for a few days to get away than take on the responsibility of full blown rent a month and then I will only be working for rent.",2,1749966582.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1lbt0zv,https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageElectronics/comments/1lbt0zv/rediscovered_my_grandfathers_old_sovietjapanese/,Rediscovered my grandfather’s old Soviet/Japanese FM radio — restoring it to honor his memory,"Hey everyone,

Recently while going through some old boxes in the attic, I came across this old AM/FM radio buried in things. My grandfather gifted it to me in late 90s. He was a radio and electronics hobbyist, loved aviation, coffee, and always had a soldering iron nearby and tinkering on something.

Suddenly it hit me like a truck and I just sat there for an hour, grown up man in his 30s, reminiscing about growing up and playing around my grandpa's workshop. He passed away suddenly in 2008 and as it always happens, I took him for granted until one day he wasn't there anymore. Today, I would give anything just to spend an hour with him, talking about life lessons and ask him for a fraction of his wisdom. I know he wanted to share his passion for electronics and radios with me, but I wasn't ready for it back then.

Long story short, I really miss him and I want to start a little fun project where I would restore it as a tribute to him and be able to listen to some jazz radio stations on it.

There's no branding on it, only ""Japan"" written on the front. For reference, we lived in Soviet Union/Russia. I've moved across the world since then. I also came up with a made-up name for it in my head-canon for fun. This radio probably cost nothing $, but to me it's the only tangible thing and a reminder I have remaining of my grandma and is pretty much priceless.

I should mention, I know nothing about fixing or repairing electronics. Let alone vintage stiff. I turned the radio on, and so far what I noticed:

* It works, switches between AM/FM and can connect to local stations
* The sound is muffled and full of static
* The screws on the back are rusty
* Plastic casing is scratched on the front and back

I would like to carefully restore the body, perhaps a little polish, while keeping the lived-in and used look. It doesn't need to shine. Clean the internals, clean the dust, buy new screws.

Would love some advice from anyone who’s done similar restorations:

* How to open and clean it safely? I heard old plastic can crack easily.
* Best way to fix or replace the speaker to make static go away? I enjoy the vintage warm sound though.
* How to clean the casing and restore the black plastic without making it glossy?

Appreciate any thoughts. This little machine means more than it looks.

I am paying on average with bundled utilities $3000 a month. My husband makes $21/hr working 8-12 hour shifts and then I work as well but from home and through gig work. We are in the red at times some months if expenses hit and have utilized credit to cover the spread. The home has massive issues due to our landlord Progress Residential not fixing them. The stove doesn't work as expected and has a gas leak and only 2 burners work. The gas hot water heater is leaking gas and the entire garage smells of gas. The ceiling has a leak at times where water is coming through on the first floor. The HVAC control unit for the temperature is hanging off the wall. The nail studs in the front door are showing and loose and none of the home's features ""smart home"" work that they force us to pay for. It is a nightmare and its on a large slope/hill so the cars cannot be parked on the driveway and people have actually fallen on the driveway and been injured. We have no other walkway the HOA wont let us even put stepping stones in the side yard thats more flat. When it rains it turns into a mud slick so its difficult. The home is near my husbands driving job, the city, and has amenities for the kids to do like play at chuck e cheese and go to the zoo/aquariums and malls. What I enjoy is these amenities and also the fact there is no snow and it is a warmer climate. However, we are being exposed to natural gas and the rent is insane and its unsafe in this rental home.

Home 2: Family owned home in Bluefield VA. We are being offered to buy it from a relative for cheap since they found out our situation ($30k cash). We can pay it with cash and have around $10k in spending to move there and rebuild. It only has 1 bathroom. It has no shower just an old tub. We have a family of 5 so this will be a difficult arrangement. It is also on a slope but has stairs up this very steep slope. It has no heating upstairs and needs that eventually replaced. It has a metal roof that was recently done, but the laundry room has a lot of repairs needed. It has a working stove and washer/dryer to start us off though as I said the laundry room was a bad addition and might need torn down or refinished eventually. It is remote and my husband's company is not there. But it has a Mall, a starbucks, a bowling alley, an arcade, and things to do mildly. Chuck e cheese and Target are far away. I know he only makes $21/hr so its not like a great job but its a job!

Home 3: Family owned home in Hornell NY. We are being offered by a relative to buy it to help get us out of renting. It is the same price $31k cash because they just paid the tax bill. It has 2 bathrooms one full and one half. No tub but a walk in shower (opposite issue as my kids enjoy a tub bath and I hate tubs and enjoy showers). It also has some issues. It has bad carpets that havent been replaced in 15 years and they had cats/dogs so it is smelly. My husband and his brother will rip these out day one while we are in a hotel they said so we won't need to smell it. He said we can walk on the subfloor and replace with vinyl hardwood 1 room at a time as he works, so we would need to rip those out day 1. I have asthma and can't be with the smells. It has a smaller lot both the lot sizes of the rental home and the Bluefield VA home are 8k sq feet this home has 2k sq feet. My husband argues along with my adult stepson that the Hornell NY home is a better situation because the carpets are just a maintenance issue along with replacing the appliances vs the structural issues in the Bluefield home where it needs a shower, and the laundry room is rather dilapidated and the heating don't work upstairs and the roof is metal. The Hornell NY home is older built in 1880 vs 1920 for the Bluefield home. The rental was built in the 1970s. As my stepson says ignore the year because its like the Theseus boat paradox lol. It needs some new paint and only the fridge works. It doesn't have a washer and dryer so we would need to sell ours and buy used or transport those on a Uhaul. It also doesn't have a stove she is taking her new stove with her so I would have to buy a stove. It is a longer move than Bluefield and $1k more. It is also remote but my husband can transfer his job to Cuba NY or Elmira NY as both have his company. The city is also hiring CDL drivers. It has restaurants and amenities but no mall, no chuck e cheese for the kids, no Starbucks, nd no zoo/aquarium. All of this is an hour away in Rochester which would be difficult to get to in the snow. For reference I enjoy having coffee and working on my at home work at Starbucks as its peaceful without toddlers running around. I need that outlet I dislike most coffee I am a huge snob. Downvote me all you want for that but no Starbucks is a huge kicker for me. It has a Tim Hortons unsure of how that is! Having no Starbucks in Hornell is the largest turn off but as my husband said that is ridiculous to not take a home and I get it lol. I am being open minded to try anything.

Neither the Hornell or Bluefield home have a garage. Bluefield has offstreet parking in a lot owned by the city where we would have to walk across a busy street then walk up the steps to the home. Hornell has street parking in front of the home. We currently have a garage and driveway with the rental but the driveway is unusable due to the slope the cars get stuck going up it and the tires spin out. Its a bad slope!

Which home would you pick? Continue renting and being on quick sand every month as my husband says while our savings dwindle. Take the Virginia home as its closer with a little more modern amenities nearby but further for bigger things like Target and zoos/chuck e cheese and kid fun. Or take the NY home it assesses for more and he has his company nearby and the city of Hornell is hiring CDL bus drivers also.

Thank you we don't know which path to take but we have people in the family trying to help due to how bad our renting situation is after they read my posts about it on my social media. I am afraid this is going to cost most my savings and if I pick wrong we wont ever recover!",1,1749966344.0,RealEstateAdvice,0,1.0,False

But I was thinking about predators on their home planet- (finally got my hands on some comics) and I was like wait- how do they drink? Do they submerge their mouth in water? Do they have tongues like dogs and cats that “scoop” water? They can’t very well take “sips” like we do because of the lack of lips. And if they don’t swallow it immediately it just drips down their face?

On a second note, when looking at their mouths in close ups during the movies their throats actually look tiny as hell. (I know we have small throats too but bear with me) this suggests their food would have to be a reasonable size. But they don’t seem to have molars- which would make chewing next to impossible so do they rip their food into little pieces to avoid choking? They’re so huge so that seems wildly inefficient for the sheer amount of calories and protein they have to consume.

I noticed over about the last 4 days or so she would yip when scratching this ear. She is about 13 weeks and we very recently adopted her. I took these pics when she was sleeping and it appears there is something that might fit the description of the kind of ""coffee grounds"" from mites but it's tough to say. There is nothing on the outer ear canal, and we haven't seen any discharge or significant signs of discomfort. The first couple days I thought she may have just accidentally scratched herself too rough but after looking I realized there was some skin abrasion so I think the ear is bothering her.

Is it worth just giving her treatment for mites OTC?

Additional context:

Normally I would just do the vet no questions asked, but we have been in and out of the vet since we got her several weeks ago. We were originally told at adoption that she had a clean bill of health, but we were called about a week after adoption and told that her record had gotten mixed up with another dog. Our dog had been a rescue from life threatening conditions and apparently when we adopted her she was just recovered from hospitalization for parvo, a bout of respiratory infections, and giardia. Even though we weren't originally informed of the health issues - we decided to try and make this work since we mostly work from home and are lucky enough to have the resources to take care of her. As of right now she is a bouncy, happy puppy except for what appears to be the beginnings of some ear problem. All that said, though, I'm several thousand dollars into taking care of this pup - so it would be great if I could just get her a treatment OTC and then have the vet sign off at our next checkup rather than having to do more testing and prescription drops or something.",2,1749965775.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False

Where Bill Kaulitz became Bill Kaulitz: Searching for clues with the VOGUE cover star in Loitsche.



For the cover story of the July/August issue of VOGUE, Bill Kaulitz traveled to the place of his childhood in Saxony-Anhalt. His best friend Andreas Gühne was there with him and shared private insights into their shared past and his life with the Kaulitzes.



By Andreas Gühne



Bill Kaulitz's best friend Andreas Gühne talks about their long-standing friendship in the VOGUE cover story.



I've known Bill and Tom since we were about twelve years old. Our paths crossed at high school in Wolmirstedt. I grew up in a village a few kilometers from Loitsche, where Bill and Tom lived with their mother and stepfather at the time. It's a small town with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants in Saxony-Anhalt, a thirty-minute drive from Magdeburg. There's not much there, actually nothing at all; the region is only known for the salt mine with its white mountain, ""Kilimanjaro."" Back then, everyone in that area knew who the Kaulitz twins were, even before they became stars with Tokio Hotel. They stood out: Tom with his dreadlocks and Bill with his distinctive hairstyles and his extroverted emo look.



Bill Kaulitz's best childhood friend on growing up together and the dark side of Tokio Hotel's fame.



I remember the day I first saw Bill. His winning smile immediately caught my eye. I, on the other hand, felt more like a wallflower at the time, a shy, slightly chubby boy whose parents dressed me in boring clothes. It was as if I lived in a different world from Bill, and I was immediately fascinated by him.



Few people know Bill Kaulitz as well, and as long as Andreas Gühne.



Outside of school, the two only had older friends and were known for their loud mouths. At some point, the situation escalated because the teachers were overwhelmed by their pranks. Bill and Tom were only concerned with testing boundaries and provoking others. That was their form of rebellion. If they were asked to do something they didn't see the point in, they simply wouldn't do it. The school administration separated the two into parallel classes. Tom was in mine. That was sometime in the second half of seventh grade, in 2003.


""If you asked them to do something they didn't see the point in, they simply wouldn't do it.""


Andreas Gühne about the Kaulitz brothers during their school days.


When Tom joined my class, everyone wanted to be friends with him. They thought he was cool with his big, baggy clothes and his fearless demeanor, the way he used to secretly smoke behind the bushes in front of the school when he was just twelve. My first encounter with Tom wasn't a pleasant one for either of us. He sat down in my seat and absolutely refused to get up. I told our teacher. Tom then wanted to sort it out with me in the schoolyard, but while I was anxiously waiting for him during recess, he immediately forgot about it, and nothing happened. Big mouth, just like that. A little later, when there was a school project for which we were divided into groups, Tom and I got to know each other better.



Even before I became friends with Tom, I heard from a classmate that Bill was on ""Star Search,"" a TV music talent show. I watched the show on my grandmother's TV with a mixture of excitement and nervousness. A few days later, at school, I complimented him on his performance and told him how impressed I was with his self-confidence. He claims today that I asked him for his autograph back then, but I think he was just wishing for it.



From eighth grade onwards, the three of us hung out together all the time and became best friends. Our buses always arrived at school at the same time, and every day, we had to wait a long time before classes started. After school, we often went to Magdeburg, where they already had their band. Ever since I've known them, Bill and Tom have been strong-willed, brave, and self-confident; that impressed me and gave me wings. I then started dyeing my hair white, wearing dark eye makeup, carpenter's trousers, and blue-sprayed combat boots. Back then, it was called emo-punk, although we never identified ourselves as such. We felt more like aliens who didn't fit in the provinces or anywhere else. We wanted to break out of this narrow-mindedness and dreariness, visually too.


""Ever since I've known them, Bill and Tom have been strong-willed, courageous, and self-confident, which has impressed me and given me wings.""


Looking back, I think I was often the calming influence for Bill and Tom back then. They were very impulsive in their twin dynamic, while I was more of a diplomatic voice, trying to smooth things over. Between them, but also externally. Sometimes, I would rein them in when they were about to go too far. What started with fare dodging or arguments with rival schoolmates eventually ended with an attempt to break into an abandoned villa. Bill would probably say today that I was always the first to jump on absurd ideas, but when it came to our physical safety, I tried to keep them both in check.


So it was a win-win situation: I was able to keep them out of trouble, and they made me more confident. I still remember an evening at Heidepark. They had rented it exclusively for their 19th birthday party, when they were already enjoying success with Tokio Hotel. Until that day, I was terrified of roller coasters, but I promised them I'd ride everyone. Thanks to Bill and Tom, I experienced many wonderful things that were outside my comfort zone.


About the change brought about by the Tokio Hotel hype.


When Tokio Hotel became really famous in 2005, it was pretty crazy. At the time, I knew that Bill and Tom had landed a record deal with their band, but none of us could have imagined the changes that were about to happen. Their breakthrough came during the summer holidays of 2005 with the song ""Durch den Monsun,"" which was on hot rotation on Viva , meaning it was played over and over again. No one expected that, at least of all Bill and Tom. When they returned to school after the holidays, it was no longer possible. There were fans there who had traveled from all over and had lined up in front of the school building. On the second day of school, the school administration had already gotten fed up with the hype, and Bill and Tom were excused from school for a year. This was a great stroke of luck for the two of them, as they were later able to complete their degrees in peace and quiet through a distance learning course.



Of course, their success filled me with pride, but I also knew that we would see each other less often. We were only 15, and many of the things you do at that age—hanging out, going to shopping malls, or to the movies —were no longer possible. Before the Tokio Hotel hype, we were a close-knit group of three who hid from the school break supervisors. The three freaks against the rest of the world, that's how it always felt. But when Bill and Tom became successful with Tokio Hotel, it was difficult for me, too, to find a good way to deal with the fuss surrounding them. Many people who had previously been against us suddenly wanted contact with them and tried to question me. At the same time, there were also envious people who had insulted us before or who had thrown their lunchboxes at us. At school, as well as in public, there was only black or white, love or hate for Bill and Tom back then. It was truly extreme.""



The two of them then moved to Hamburg. Visiting them in their first apartment was exciting. I spent most of my holidays there. After graduating from high school, I moved to Hamburg myself to study, and we were able to spend more time together again. But even there, the two of them couldn't just go out; they were immediately surrounded by fans. So they either had to book security, or when we needed NicNacs and frozen pizza for our evening plans, we drove to the supermarket together, and the two of them waited in the car while I did the shopping. The dark side of fame that Bill and Tom experienced, the constant public scrutiny, was often very overwhelming for them.



Shadow of Fame and the Road to Los Angeles.


They felt imprisoned. The saying about the bird in a gilded cage was their reality. They longed for freedom and anonymity; they didn't want this siege. And those outside the door had long since ceased to be normal fans. These girls wanted attention at any price, no matter what form it took. It got so bad that eventually they started following me, even to university. My apartment at the time was on the ground floor, and they threw eggs at the windows. Once, they even sprayed graffiti on my windows. ""Faggot"" was written on the wall. They sprayed the windows shut, poured oil into the hallway, and threatened me – all with masked faces.



On one of Bill and Tom's birthdays, while we were celebrating together in Denmark, their house was broken into. Everything was ransacked, and the two felt robbed of their last vestige of privacy. The next day, they moved into a hotel. That was also the moment Bill and Tom decided to break free from it all and move to America. And that was the very best decision for both of them, and especially for Bill.



Bill has changed a lot there, and for the better. This has become particularly clear in recent years. He used to be melancholic and much more introverted; he even had a heavy side to him. Through the podcast "" Kaulitz Hills – Mustard from Hollywood ,"" which the two have been running since 2021, he's probably learned how liberating it is to share openly. And how good it feels to realize that people like you just the way you are. This, along with the freedom in Los Angeles, has helped him understand himself better. I've seen how he's grown and how good it is for him now to simply be himself and to express his innermost thoughts.



About Bill Kaulitz as a private person: Life-affirming, open, generous.


I would describe Bill as a warm-hearted and positive person. He has never been someone who thinks things through endlessly or is plagued by doubt. It's typical of him: When an opportunity presents itself, he immediately says yes. He's always up for adventure. Despite all his self-confidence, he can also be shy, especially when it comes to romance. That's really cute. Despite his loud mouth, he's sensitive, has a big heart, and empathy for others. That's probably why he has so many good friends. He's not like other stars who deliberately keep their circle small or have trouble trusting others.


""Typical of Bill: An opportunity presents itself, and he immediately says yes. Always jump into the adventure.""



He wears his heart on his sleeve. He likes to share not only material things with his closest confidants but also his thoughts and secrets. After a tour or other intensive work phases, he naturally retreats to recharge his social batteries, but overall, he's someone who enjoys being around people, preferably a diverse group from different backgrounds and walks of life. When he celebrates his birthday with Tom, for example, the most wonderful thing for him is watching how all these contrasts collide and what develops from them.



Injustice really pisses him off; he always advocates for fairness. I value that in him not only as a friend but also as a business partner. We often collaborate on projects; I'm a freelance art director and graphic designer, and in addition to album covers and campaigns, He recently designed his own clothing line, cosmetics, tequila. He's a pleasure to work with. We trust each other, and there's not a word, no matter how honest, that either of us could misunderstand. His ability to make others feel good makes him a truly special person to me.



I can still clearly remember our coming out to each other when we were already 18. It was during one of my visits to his Hamburg villa, and as we said goodnight, he said to me, ""I have to tell you something tomorrow."" I replied, ""I think I know what it is, and I have to tell you and Tom something too."" He said, ""I think I know what it is, too."" We both laughed. For a long time, he hid his sexuality from the public, partly because of his fans and because this neutrality was expected of him. It put a lot of strain on him. I'm so happy for him that he can now just blurt out everything that's on his mind. He is 100 percent authentic. He presents himself in the Netflix documentary or on the podcast, and that's how he is in private, too. He never puts on an act. He doesn't have to because he doesn't really have any bad sides. He's perhaps a bit impatient and wants things to happen immediately. This impatience sometimes frustrates him. He's very tidy, sometimes even pedantic. For example, when visitors leave a used coffee cup on the coffee table, I know it annoys him.



Our friendship is based on honesty and openness. Even though we often can't meet for extended periods, it's always clear that we can count on each other. The three of us have a group chat where we send each other memes and newspaper articles every day. We text, but we also talk a lot on the phone. A few months ago, I was going through some personal drama and sent them a quick text saying I needed to talk. Less than five minutes later, my phone rang, and the three of us connected for a crisis conference.



Maintaining this close friendship beyond the phone isn't always easy, of course. It's definitely me who has to be flexible and spontaneous so we can see each other as often as possible. But that's totally fine with me; I enjoy every moment we can spend together. Next up, we're all looking forward to Georg's wedding. He's marrying Susi in September, who also comes from our hometown and whom we've all known for a very, very long time. I think almost all of us had a crush on her at some point; for all the boys, she was the prettiest girl in school. That's the wonderful thing about Bill: his loyalty. This loyalty shows that, despite all his success, he's simply Bill Kaulitz from Loitsche, for whom true friendship is the most important thing.",2,1749965226.0,tokiohotel,0,1.0,False

For context, we were raised in the religion but all broke away as teenagers. As many ex-JWs know, that often means you’re silently pushed out or avoided by family.

She didn’t attend our weddings or any major events, made no effort to stay in touch, and essentially disappeared from our lives. Out of nowhere, she reached out because she heard I was moving and offered to grab coffee — with no real acknowledgment of her absence.

After sitting with it, I decided to respond honestly and respectfully. I told her that years of no contact or effort toward me and my sisters, including missing our weddings, had led her to no longer be a part of my life, and that I wasn’t able to reconnect. I ended the message by wishing her the best of luck.

This was her full response, word for word:

“Ok 👍 It was just a coffee, nothing dramatic. I wasn’t asking to be besties, Agree we are not in each other’s lives and from my point of view back then It actually felt mutual and respectful, as you all wanted nothing to do with my way life.

When I went to Arizona I met up with my own aunt lily who we didn’t put effort in each others life, yet just had casual coffee – it was in that vein was connecting. It was pleasant.

Maybe will see you at Mom and Dad anniversary and know we both will always show love and respect regardless if in each others life when see happen to see each other

I do hear of all three of you from my Mom Dad and Ang and so happy you are doing well and they are proud of you!


So basically… she completely downplayed everything. She rewrote the situation as “mutual” and implied we were the ones who wanted nothing to do with her. She used vague, noncommittal language, no apology, and completely ignored the reality of the shunning and the hurt that came with it.

Now my sister says I shouldn’t have said anything, but honestly, it felt good to finally be honest and not pretend this was a normal relationship. I was calm, respectful, and truthful — and now I feel like I’m being guilted for not staying silent.",3,1749964682.0,family,2,1.0,False

I told her he was nice, but i’d only be interested in getting to know him as friends and nothing else. she told me i should give him a chance as he was a good person, which pissed me off a little because i’m sure he’s a great person i’m simply not interested in going out with him in that way. 

he texted me telling me we should go to the movies since we had agreed to do so, i felt a little uncomfortable talking to him after my friend had suggested he was interested in me but he didn’t make any moves so i just agreed to the movies (thinking if he’s interested in having a date he’s going to ask and i will have the chance to say i just want to go out as friends). When he told me he’d bought the tickets and sent me his account info so i could pay him back for my half, i felt very relieved as i thought (very traditional of me) that if he didn’t refuse to let me pay for my ticket then it definitely wasn’t a date. i felt a lot more comfortable texting him as i assumed he wasn’t interested romantically.

we went to the movies and grabbed a bite, i had a nice time and, just in case, i made sure to keep my distance and to not do anything that might suggest i was interested in him. i thought things were going well but as we were walking to leave he said stuff like “that was a very good date” and “i know it’s a very basic date destination but do you like going to coffee shops?” which really caught me off guard as he hadn’t used the word date at any point before. I didn’t know how to respond to that, so i just agreed and said i also had a nice time. I know maybe he was testing me to see my reaction and that it was my chance to say i wasn’t interested, but i felt too trapped and uncomfortable to say anything. i usually don’t mind speaking my mind but i’m also a people pleaser and i didn’t want it to be an awkward situation for either of us.

now that i’ve had some hours to think about it, i’m really upset that 1. someone would act so nonchalant about dating that i only find out it’s a date through an offhanded comment. no matter how nice he is im really pissed off about being tricked into a date without being informed about it. 2. feeling rude or mean when i inevitably have to tell him i’m not interested in going out when he should have been the one to ask me if i wanted it to be a date in the first place. 3. he kept asking to drink from my water bottle (mind you this is a person i’ve seen three times in my life) and at some point he stopped asking and just kept grabbing the bottle and drinking from it.

1lbsimc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lbsimc/needing_to_choose_between_3_different_homes/,Needing to choose between 3 different homes. Advice please!,"Home 1: I currently rent it in the Atlanta area. I am paying on average with bundled utilities $3000 a month. My husband makes $21/hr working 8-12 hour shifts and then I work as well but from home and through gig work. We are in the red at times some months if expenses hit and have utilized credit to cover the spread. The home has massive issues due to our landlord Progress Residential not fixing them. The stove doesn't work as expected and has a gas leak and only 2 burners work. The gas hot water heater is leaking gas and the entire garage smells of gas. The ceiling has a leak at times where water is coming through on the first floor. The HVAC control unit for the temperature is hanging off the wall. The nail studs in the front door are showing and loose and none of the home's features ""smart home"" work that they force us to pay for. It is a nightmare and its on a large slope/hill so the cars cannot be parked on the driveway and people have actually fallen on the driveway and been injured. We have no other walkway the HOA wont let us even put stepping stones in the side yard thats more flat. When it rains it turns into a mud slick so its difficult. The home is near my husbands driving job, the city, and has amenities for the kids to do like play at chuck e cheese and go to the zoo/aquariums and malls. What I enjoy is these amenities and also the fact there is no snow and it is a warmer climate. However, we are being exposed to natural gas and the rent is insane and its unsafe in this rental home.

  
Home 2: Family owned home in Bluefield VA. We are being offered to buy it from a relative for cheap since they found out our situation ($30k cash). We can pay it with cash and have around $10k in spending to move there and rebuild. It only has 1 bathroom. It has no shower just an old tub. We have a family of 5 so this will be a difficult arrangement. It is also on a slope but has stairs up this very steep slope. It has no heating upstairs and needs that eventually replaced. It has a metal roof that was recently done, but the laundry room has a lot of repairs needed. It has a working stove and washer/dryer to start us off though as I said the laundry room was a bad addition and might need torn down or refinished eventually. It is remote and my husband's company is not there. But it has a Mall, a starbucks, a bowling alley, an arcade, and things to do mildly. Chuck e cheese and Target are far away. I know he only makes $21/hr so its not like a great job but its a job! 

  
Home 3: Family owned home in Hornell NY. We are being offered by a relative to buy it to help get us out of renting. It is the same price $31k cash because they just paid the tax bill. It has 2 bathrooms one full and one half. No tub but a walk in shower (opposite issue as my kids enjoy a tub bath and I hate tubs and enjoy showers). It also has some issues. It has bad carpets that havent been replaced in 15 years and they had cats/dogs so it is smelly. My husband and his brother will rip these out day one while we are in a hotel they said so we won't need to smell it. He said we can walk on the subfloor and replace with vinyl hardwood 1 room at a time as he works, so we would need to rip those out day 1. I have asthma and can't be with the smells. It has a smaller lot both the lot sizes of the rental home and the Bluefield VA home are 8k sq feet this home has 2k sq feet. My husband argues along with my adult stepson that the Hornell NY home is a better situation because the carpets are just a maintenance issue along with replacing the appliances vs the structural issues in the Bluefield home where it needs a shower, and the laundry room is rather dilapidated and the heating don't work upstairs and the roof is metal. The Hornell NY home is older built in 1880 vs 1920 for the Bluefield home. The rental was built in the 1970s. As my stepson says ignore the year because its like the Theseus boat paradox lol. It needs some new paint and only the fridge works. It doesn't have a washer and dryer so we would need to sell ours and buy used or transport those on a Uhaul. It also doesn't have a stove she is taking her new stove with her so I would have to buy a stove. It is a longer move than Bluefield and $1k more. It is also remote but my husband can transfer his job to Cuba NY or Elmira NY as both have his company. The city is also hiring CDL drivers. It has restaurants and amenities but no mall, no chuck e cheese for the kids, no Starbucks, nd no zoo/aquarium. All of this is an hour away in Rochester which would be difficult to get to in the snow. For reference I enjoy having coffee and working on my at home work at Starbucks as its peaceful without toddlers running around. I need that outlet I dislike most coffee I am a huge snob. Downvote me all you want for that but no Starbucks is a huge kicker for me. It has a Tim Hortons unsure of how that is! Having no Starbucks in Hornell is the largest turn off but as my husband said that is ridiculous to not take a home and I get it lol. I am being open minded to try anything.

Neither the Hornell or Bluefield home have a garage. Bluefield has offstreet parking in a lot owned by the city where we would have to walk across a busy street then walk up the steps to the home. Hornell has street parking in front of the home. We currently have a garage and driveway with the rental but the driveway is unusable due to the slope the cars get stuck going up it and the tires spin out. Its a bad slope!

Which home would you pick? Continue renting and being on quick sand every month as my husband says while our savings dwindle. Take the Virginia home as its closer with a little more modern amenities nearby but further for bigger things like Target and zoos/chuck e cheese and kid fun. Or take the NY home it assesses for more and he has his company nearby and the city of Hornell is hiring CDL bus drivers also.

Thank you we don't know which path to take but we have people in the family trying to help due to how bad our renting situation is after they read my posts about it on my social media. I am afraid this is going to cost most my savings and if I pick wrong we wont ever recover! ",1,1749964586.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1lbsh17,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1lbsh17/my_aunt_cut_us_off_for_years_now_she_wants_to/,"My aunt cut us off for years, now she wants to reconnect like nothing happened","I recently received a message from my aunt, someone who is a Jehovah’s Witness and chose to cut off me and my sisters years ago. For context, we were raised in the religion but all broke away as teenagers. As many ex-JWs know, that often means you’re silently pushed out or avoided by family.

She didn’t attend our weddings or any major events, made no effort to stay in touch, and essentially disappeared from our lives. Out of nowhere, she reached out because she heard I was moving and offered to grab coffee — with no real acknowledgment of her absence.

After sitting with it, I decided to respond honestly and respectfully. I told her that years of no contact or effort toward me and my sisters, including missing our weddings, had led her to no longer be a part of my life, and that I wasn’t able to reconnect. I ended the message by wishing her the best of luck.

This was her full response, word for word:

“Ok 👍 It was just a coffee, nothing dramatic. I wasn’t asking to be besties, Agree we are not in each other’s lives and from my point of view back then It actually felt mutual and respectful, as you all wanted nothing to do with my way life.

When I went to Arizona I met up with my own aunt lily who we didn’t put effort in each others life, yet just had casual coffee – it was in that vein was connecting. It was pleasant.

Maybe will see you at Mom and Dad 60 anniversary and know we both will always show love and respect regardless if in each others life when see happen to see each other

I do hear of all three of you from my Mom Dad and Ang and so happy you are doing well and they are proud of you!



So basically… she completely downplayed everything. She rewrote the situation as “mutual” and implied we were the ones who wanted nothing to do with her. She used vague, noncommittal language, no apology, and completely ignored the reality of the shunning and the hurt that came with it.

Now my sister says I shouldn’t have said anything, but honestly, it felt good to finally be honest and not pretend this was a normal relationship. I was calm, respectful, and truthful — and now I feel like I’m being guilted for not staying silent.",8,1749964426.0,exjw,2,0.9,False

Overall we vibe and have pretty similar interests and he’s a smart guy type which i appreciate. i’m on my final year of uni and he’s doing his internship. And the reason im saying this, is because neither of us is too rich but i went through a harsh period financially for more or less a year that im finally out of, and now i finally get to go out, spend more etc to enjoy. We live in a big city, and im the adventurous type when it comes to going out as in i like trying new different places, new bars, restaurants , cinema etc and generally do it alone when there is no one to follow. I was excited when seeing this guy because i thought there is finally someone i like who’d get to share those activities with me. But the thing is, each time i suggest an activity or a place he immediately starts bringing up money and costs. Of course, i know he’s not at his best financially like i said, and we went to museums, parks and walking dates initially. Then it started going worse when there was one day i suggested a local (good) restaurant. When we were there let’s say, he made quite a reaction, refused to order any meal and just got a drink and couldnt stop complaining about how expensive it is (by the way it wasn’t, those were literally the average meal costs where i live, it just that it wasn’t the good deal student cheap type)  and even made us leave it earlier when i was actually having a good time sitting and talking. I felt  genuinely guilty, because i was the one who suggested the place after he asked me to. Ever since then, he admitted he doesn’t like going to do or buy ‘costly’ things, as he grew up in middle class family and extravagant things remind him of the rich not so nice people at his school. Which explained  kinda his reaction when we went to the place because it became clear it’s not just the cost idk?

Of course i respect the fact that he’s on a budget, but i feel like it’s getting worse ever since. We dont see each other too much those days so we agreed we could see each other just once a week for the time being. 2 days ago we went out and i let him choose the place, we had a very nice (part of the reason which im frustrated because i like spending time with him). Today we were talking about next plans for next times, and suddenly brings up the same issue again, that he’d like to coffees from now on or just get beers at the park and sit on the grass because we can’t get ‘big’ meals each time like that. Saying that from now on we’ll do that just once a week. I dont know, i got too irritated. Because well, i like doing that type of thing from time to time, but not all the time. I am the type of person who likes to dress well and do good makeup , go to good places and enjoy good things. Obviously it’s not just food and it’s not like i will die if i eat at home or cant go alone after uni to eat something’fancy’. But the thing is that it’s like that for each plan i suggest. Cinema? Too expensive but we can go once a month. Escape room ? Same thing. Amusement park ? Same thing over and over. I feel on edge now whenever i go out with him, because when on streets i cant even spontaneously choose a place to drink a beer because of that, we have to look up the cheap ones. I’m at a point where i just look forward to seeing my friends more because at least everyone orders their thing without talking about money every 2 seconds

I know he is not wrong, that he wants to respect his budget and that he just can’t sometimes. I really do respect that fact. But i’m just getting tired, especially when he mentions that the reason why is not that he doesn’t have money per se but that he’s doing savings because he doesn’t like to splurge according to him and that he saves to also pay off his school debt which again is too respectable except that he goes to a top school (hence the rich classmates thing) and that his salary once he graduates will probably so good that he wont have to worry too much about the debt? I know because i have a friend who now works and went to his same school also with a loan. I mean technically all of this is his business it’s just that i overall have a feeling that it’s not that he doesnt hve anything he just doesnt want to spend. He also explained to me that in his family and culture they are the type who’d go frugal in daily life just to afford the big and better things (likebig house, or good yearly vacations etc) and that he’s into that approach. Which for me made the thing even worse because i dont agree with this vision at all and it made the thing worse because it’s not just a temporary thing. I feel angry and a bit trapped, becauae when i met him i didnt even want a serious relationship i just went along because i liked him a lot.

So now im curious what do you all think i should do? Also any advice on what i should do is appreciated im not stubborn and listen to good inputs

TLDR: im seeing a guy that i really like. I enjoy going to good restaurants or cinema or doing ‘fancy’, but he doesnt have too much money and prefers free or cheap places and says we should only do those once in a while.

The door stood in a field of darkness. It glowed from within, covered in stars and comets, spinning wildly across the surface. Constant motion. His hands followed the path of a comet as it streaked across the wood before disappearing off the edge of the door.

He circled it. Front and back looked the same, a disarray of stars. The handle was out of place, a simple silver latch. He reached out, the metal cold under his fingers.

“I wouldn’t do that.” A voice murmured behind him.

He turned sharply. A robed figure stood behind him, a cavernous hood shadowed the face. Hands were hidden by elegant sleeves. They walked forward, gliding as if they hovered just above the ground.

“Why not?” He asked.

“Because there is a price. You’ve been brought here to decide.”

“Decide what?”

“If you want your wife returned.”

The breath left his lungs. He stumbled back from the door, falling to sit. The figure didn’t move, simply watching him until he got his breathing under control.

“What do you mean, returned?”

The figure gestured to the door. “This is a gateway. To a different time and place. One in which your wife still lives. All you must do is step through.”

His mind flashed back to the hospital, his wife’s pale lips as she whispered to him before the doctors took her away. The warmth of the tiny baby in his hands. The way the nurses wouldn’t meet his eyes when he asked about his wife.

The handle pressed halfway down before the robbed figure’s words came back to him.

“You said there was a price.”

He could almost feel the robbed figure’s smile as it studied him from under the hood. 

“Yes. A price. All things have a price. A life for a life.”

His heart thudded in his chest. “Mine?”

“No, not yours.”

The handle rose to its original position and he stepped back from the door. “The baby’s.”

There was silence from the figure. He backed away from the door further. He stumbled on nothing, falling to his rear, eyes glued to the door.

“My wife’s life, for the baby’s.” He whispered.

There was a lump in his throat. He was finding it hard to breathe. The weeks weighed heavily on his shoulders. The baby’s heavy breathing. The warmth in his arms, on his chest. The hot milk throw-up. The cries of hunger and loneliness.

How could he trade that away? How could he not? 

His wife’s smile, her clean soap smell, the touch of her fingertips on his skin. He pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes until his vision bloomed with colour from the pressure. 

“I can’t.”

He lifted his head to tell the robed figure that he *couldn’t* give up his baby for his wife, no matter how much he wished his wife was with him. He couldn’t lose the baby.

Sunlight filtered through his bedroom window, the curtains opened in the night by the breeze. He sat up, pushing his hair back from his face. He needed a haircut. A haircut and a coffee. The baby stirred in the bassinet next to the bed. He ran a gentle hand over her head, watching her mouth open and close, searching for comfort and food.

For some context me and my mother have never had a great relationship but it's never been to bad I guess. Just some stupid fights, or rather her yelling and me nodding because I'm not really good at handeling yelling. I just want to get it over with. 

Last night my mother rushed to me and shoved a card in my hand, she told me to hide it and sign it later for father's day. Before my father comes back into the house. So I run to my room and hide it. I forget to sign in that night. 

The next morning I'm feeding my cat, it's still early, and my mother suddenly comes in asking where the card is. I freeze for a moment. And start looking. She goes to the kitchen to start the kettle to make coffee for my dad. Then comes back as I'm looking for the card. And I can't find it. 

At this point I'm panicking because I just cannot remember where the hell I put the card and I know my mother is going to go off on me. She comes back, looking at me expectantly. And I tell her I can't remember where I put it. But I do know where the presents is. 

She gives me a look, like that one that tells you your a dissappointment before it fades into pure anger, she starts berading me with comments about how dumb and stupid I am, I almost just yell back an I know and I'm sorry. But I instead just start choking and crying. I start frantically looking. And my mother starts throwing stuff on the floor. Just.. destorying everything looking for this card. And I start crying louder.

She eventually says I just need to leave it alone. She goes and gets my little brother and leaves me in my room where I squat down, hitting my head as hard as I can just to remedember where the card is. I will admit I never had the best coping mechanism  so I just continued smacking my head or biting my fingers. She comes back with my brother, he looks at me with confusion and pity. My mother tells me to suck it up and go wash my face. So I do. Doesn't work. 

So we go into my fathers room and give him the present and coffee, no card obviously. I'm just trying so hard not to burst out crying and make it all about me. We stand in the room with them a few minutes. Before leaving. My brother mumbles something about my mother being in a bad mood and goes to his room and I go to mine to sit down and cry some more.

Because I feel like the worst daughter to walk this earth.

Like 10 minutes later my father pokes his head into the hall asking if me and my brother were ready because we leave in five minutes. Both of us are shocked, we didn't even know we were supposed to be ready yet. We start putting clothes on for church and my father says be ready in 5 minutes. I'm panicking again.

My parents are in the church band, my mother the leader, so they have to be there. I go to her room and ask her if there was time to help with my makeup. Because I'm insecure and everytime I do it I look like a ghost. She used to be a makeup artist... she tells me no. With a glare that burns with the hate of a thousand suns. My dad says he'll pick us up later and tells us we need to be ready by then. I go to my room. And cry.. again. 

My mother comes in, and calls me stupid again. That she can't understand why I'm crying and can't do my makeup on my own and tells me that I need to get over it. And leaves.

They have a little storage area in the back and usually put merch/patries/purchased coffee in a bag so I didn’t think to check anything since it’s always been correct. Realized when I got home that they grinded the coffee beans there. Tried to pull a shot: 18g coffee, 36g in 12 seconds.

1lbs7lx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lbs7lx,"I no longer have the studio space to make toys with resin or resin printing and I can’t pay for tooling, so I’ve made my recent toy collections with FDM printing. Here’s some images of my 3 collections currently in progress!","For all my FDM toys I tried to use multiple components and the Bambu AMS on small details where applicable to add more depth. Use of the AMS was a balancing act because of how much material and time waste it generates. It was so much faster to print multiple solid-color components to assemble rather than using AMS to print in one go, but AMS almost always produces cleaner results. I tried to avoid painting when possible because of the post-processing required, which would have been especially difficult on finer details, but on things like the shrooms there is some simple dry brushing and minor painted details. packaging was also done with a couple of different FDM components, specifically the 3D printed NFC tag and tooling to emboss the backside of the bag.

For the shrooms and Tiny Double Coffee collections I did 3 variations in each, and for the Alone with Grief toy the design has integrated magnets so you can collect and swap out different ghost companions. Where possible I tried to share components across designs. Also a note about the Tiny Doubles: they were originally inspired by Tim Hortons cups but to avoid copyright infringement I changed the text. Iykyk Canadians.

To round each collection out, I also did minis that are also cellphone charms and am currently developing a paracord strap keychain design. I’ve noticed the toy market moving toward functionality and the conversion of toys to accessories, so I wanted to make functional pieces to follow that and diversify price points.

Overall, I think FDM (straight from the printer) is becoming a more viable medium for creating designer toys and a good way to produce complex small-batch productions affordably, but it certainly has it’s shortcomings. The rise of high-performance printers like the Bambus and creality K-series, as well as the advent of multi-material systems, has made creating parts of consistently high quality and detail much more achievable. FDM may never match the quality of tooled or resin printed toys, but by using multiple components, multi-material, and mixed materials, you can definitely get good results.

1lbs76v,https://i.redd.it/s2cqw5kov07f1.jpeg,One year in Japan - Statistics for any bro interested .,"Always see posts here asking if Japanese is a good PPB location. This is my honest opinion feedback and statistics after 1 year living here.

Moved here one year ago (June 14th 2024) with below N5 level Japanese.
Currently hovering low N2.
N5 is the lowest level of Japanese with N1 being the highest.

I thought I’d give some insight to any bro’s who are genuinely thinking about going to Japan 💪🏼.

Throughout my year here I’ve been documenting my journey here.
Last year June to maybe September, N5 Level Japanese
October to January - N4 Level Japanese 
January to May - N3 level Japanese 
Now - Low N2 level Japanese.

I’ve included the total number of dates I went on, how many girls I’ve slept with, and their nationality/their language speaking abilities.

I’m missing probably around 30’ish dates or so (I forgot to write them in my journal, so I won’t count them.).

I do currently have a girlfriend who I’m probably going to marry, but her rule is very simple as long as I don’t tell her, and use condoms, I can sleep with other girls.

Pro’s: I’d say Japanese girls are the absolute best in the world at giving sex, having traditional values, etc.
Con’s: A lot of the girls who speak English DON’T have these values because they’ve been to the west and lived there.

Tl;dr:
In one year I:
Went out with about 77 women.
I had sex with 47 of them.
24 of them spoke English.

Would I recommend this as a PPB destination?
Yes and No.
Yes if you’re willing to put in the effort to learn Japanese.
No if you’re not willing to learn Japanese.

I raised a support case with Delinghi and asked for a replacement machine with the similar features that does not have what seems to be a “known” issue and all support have said via email that they are going to have collection done with the machine and a full refund . 

I really like this machine and it seems support are also aware of this issue hence not even bothering with an attempted repair .

1lbs53l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lbs53l/aio_about_my_girlfriend_of_2_years_randomly_going/,AIO about my girlfriend of 2 years randomly going out with a guy she was set up to date?,"I 23M had a long conversation with my girlfriend 21M tonight about boundaries after she had brought up randomly that she was going out with a co-worker to get coffee. She had just come back from hanging with friends and we had a call on her drive home. We spoke about our days, and then the aforementioned plans came up. 

  
The person she was going to coffee with was her co-worker who's mom tried to get them to date about a year ago. She had apparently been talking to him trying to make plans, and after a couple had fallen through, he had expressed interest in wanting to get coffee with her. Over the phone she just brought it up like it meant nothing, and it upset me quite a bit. 

  
The reason I feel upset is because my partner has gotten very upset in the past over me hanging out with women, whether it's a lifetime childhood friend or just a co-worker, they've always gotten defensive. I had assumed that this boundary went both ways, and to my dismay they've been hainging out with single dudes one on one off and on over the past six months. It's made me feel quite upset that something that's so serious to her doesn't warrant any sort of conversation when she does a similar thing. 

  
I don't really think that they'd cheat on me nor do I care about them hanging out with these people. What I'm upset about is that they had an established boundary with me that hanging out with the oppossite gender one on one is a big no-no. Even hanging out with childhood friends of the opposite sex has made her uncomfortable, so I've generally tried to either group up with those friends or say no altogether. 

  
I don't know if I'm crazy for this, but the whole situation has made me uncomfy. What's more, my partner started getting really upset over me bringing this up and almost getting mad at me for talking about it. This is my first healthy relationship, so I'm not sure if I'm being an asshole for trying to talk to her about this boundary, but to me this has all felt very wrong and off ): ",5,1749963184.0,AmIOverreacting,15,0.78,False

Overall we vibe and have pretty similar interests and he’s a smart guy type which i appreciate. i’m on my final year of uni and he’s doing his internship. And the reason im saying this, is because neither of us is too rich but i went through a harsh period financially for more or less a year that im finally out of, and now i finally get to go out, spend more etc to enjoy. We live in a big city, and im the adventurous type when it comes to going out as in i like trying new different places, new bars, restaurants , cinema etc and generally do it alone when there is no one to follow. I was excited when seeing this guy because i thought there is finally someone i like who’d get to share those activities with me. But the thing is, each time i suggest an activity or a place he immediately starts bringing up money and costs. Of course, i know he’s not at his best financially like i said, and we went to museums, parks and walking dates initially. Then it started going worse when there was one day i suggested a local (good) restaurant. When we were there let’s say, he made quite a reaction, refused to order any meal and just got a drink and couldnt stop complaining about how expensive it is (by the way it wasn’t, those were literally the average meal costs where i live, it just that it wasn’t the good deal student cheap type)  and even made us leave it earlier when i was actually having a good time sitting and talking. I felt  genuinely guilty, because i was the one who suggested the place after he asked me to. Ever since then, he admitted he doesn’t like going to do or buy ‘costly’ things, as he grew up in middle class family and extravagant things remind him of the rich not so nice people at his school. Which explained  kinda his reaction when we went to the place because it became clear it’s not just the cost idk?

Of course i respect the fact that he’s on a budget, but i feel like it’s getting worse ever since. We dont see each other too much those days so we agreed we could see each other just once a week for the time being. 2 days ago we went out and i let him choose the place, we had a very nice (part of the reason which im frustrated because i like spending time with him). Today we were talking about next plans for next times, and suddenly brings up the same issue again, that he’d like to coffees from now on or just get beers at the park and sit on the grass because we can’t get ‘big’ meals each time like that. Saying that from now on we’ll do that just once a week. I dont know, i got too irritated. Because well, i like doing that type of thing from time to time, but not all the time. I am the type of person who likes to dress well and do good makeup , go to good places and enjoy good things. Obviously it’s not just food and it’s not like i will die if i eat at home or cant go alone after uni to eat something’fancy’. But the thing is that it’s like that for each plan i suggest. Cinema? Too expensive but we can go once a month. Escape room ? Same thing. Amusement park ? Same thing over and over. I feel on edge now whenever i go out with him, because when on streets i cant even spontaneously choose a place to drink a beer because of that, we have to look up the cheap ones. I’m at a point where i just look forward to seeing my friends more because at least everyone orders their thing without talking about money every 2 seconds

I know he is not wrong, that he wants to respect his budget and that he just can’t sometimes. I really do respect that fact. But i’m just getting tired, especially when he mentions that the reason why is not that he doesn’t have money per se but that he’s doing savings because he doesn’t like to splurge according to him and that he saves to also pay off his school debt which again is too respectable except that he goes to a top school (hence the rich classmates thing) and that his salary once he graduates will probably so good that he wont have to worry too much about the debt? I know because i have a friend who now works and went to his same school also with a loan. I mean technically all of this is his business it’s just that i overall have a feeling that it’s not that he doesnt hve anything he just doesnt want to spend. He also explained to me that in his family and culture they are the type who’d go frugal in daily life just to afford the big and better things (likebig house, or good yearly vacations etc) and that he’s into that approach. Which for me made the thing even worse because i dont agree with this vision at all and it made the thing worse because it’s not just a temporary thing. I feel angry and a bit trapped, becauae when i met him i didnt even want a serious relationship i just went along because i liked him a lot.

So now i wanna know if im overracting? Also any advice on what i should do is appreciated im not stubborn and listen to good inputs

TLDR: im seeing a guy that i really like. I enjoy going to good restaurants or cinema or doing ‘fancy’, but he doesnt have too much money and prefers free or cheap places and says we should only do those once in a while.

## Key Features Analysis

Finding the best matcha chocolate involves more than just a taste test. Several pivotal features determine the quality and appeal of each brand.

**Matcha Quality:** The quality of the matcha is paramount. High-grade matcha is vibrant green, subtly sweet, and lacks bitterness, whereas lower-grade matcha can be dull in colour and unpleasantly bitter. the best matcha chocolates use ceremonial-grade or premium culinary-grade matcha sourced directly from reputable farms in Japan.The quality of matcha directly impacts the overall flavor profile and experience of the chocolate. A high-quality matcha delivers a smooth,nuanced flavor that complements the chocolate without overpowering it. Low quality matcha, distinguished by its lack of vibrant green color, often introduces a more bitter and grassy flavor dimension. This bitterness can disrupt the delicate balance, making the chocolate less enjoyable and difficult to perceive the other flavors, ultimately diminishing the overall quality of the product.

**Chocolate Type & Origin:** The type of chocolate used significantly affects the overall profile. Dark chocolate enhances the matcha's bitterness, while white chocolate accentuates its sweetness and creates a creamy texture. milk chocolate strikes a balance between the two providing a creamy but not too sweet product. the origin of the cacao beans also plays a crucial role in the final flavor of the chocolate.

The selection of the chocolate base is fundamental in crafting the harmonious matcha chocolate experience. Dark chocolate, celebrated for its robust and slightly bitter notes, creates an unexpected combination with the matcha's natural bitterness. White chocolate, conversely, offers a sweetened canvas, exalting the pleasant aspects of matcha and resulting in a product that tends to be sweeter. The choice of cacao beans' origin presents another nuanced element, as each terroir expresses its fingerprint in the overall taste.**Ingredients & Additives:** the quality and sourcing of ingredients are increasingly vital to consumers.Top-tier matcha chocolates avoid artificial flavors, preservatives, and excessive sugar. Look for brands that use organic ingredients and clear sourcing practices.

The integrity of matcha chocolate is frequently enough defined by the clarity of its ingredient composition. Prioritizing organic components and shunning artificial flavors and preservatives is an indicator that the brand cares for the integrity of its products. the trend toward ingredient openness underscores a dedication to consumer well-being, providing buyers with confidence in what they are consuming, promoting both satisfaction and brand loyalty.

**Texture & Melt:** A good matcha chocolate should have a smooth, creamy texture and melt evenly in the mouth. Grainy or waxy textures indicate lower-quality ingredients or improper processing.

The tactile characteristics present importent characteristics. The smoothness of the coating is directly dependent upon the processing precision and ingredient selection employed during the chocolate-making procedure. A granular or waxy feel is a distinct indication of inferior ingredient quality or an insufficient manufacturing process, detracting from the product.

**Packaging & Preservation:** Proper packaging ensures the chocolate’s freshness and protects it from light, heat, and moisture. Airtight,opaque packaging is essential for preserving the matcha's delicate flavor and vibrant color.

The role of packaging extends beyond mere aesthetic considerations; it protects the integrity of it from environmental assailants. Airtight and opaque packaging is pivotal in maintaining the product characteristics, guarding against light and fluctuating temperatures.

**Ethical Sourcing & Production:** Many consumers now favor brands that prioritize ethical sourcing and enduring production practices. Look for certifications such as Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, or B Corp, indicating a commitment to fair labor practices and environmental obligation.

Sustainability is at the heart of ethical commerce. Brands that support eco-pleasant production methodologies are progressively favored globally. Fair Trade certificates, Rainforest Alliance, and B Corp indicate the brand cares about the workers and environmental care.

## FAQs Section

Here are some commonly asked questions about matcha chocolate.

**What are the key differences between culinary-grade and ceremonial-grade matcha in chocolate?**
Culinary-grade matcha is typically used for baking and cooking due to its stronger flavor, which can stand up to other ingredients. Ceremonial-grade matcha is higher quality, has a smoother, sweeter flavor, and is traditionally used for tea ceremonies. In chocolate, ceremonial-grade matcha provides a more refined and subtle flavor, while culinary-grade offers a bolder taste.

**How should I store matcha chocolate to maintain its quality?**
Store matcha chocolate in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat. Ideally, keep it in an airtight container to prevent moisture absorption. Refrigeration is generally not recommended, as it can cause the chocolate to bloom (develop a white film) and affect its texture.

**Is matcha chocolate suitable for people with caffeine sensitivity?**
Matcha contains caffeine, even though generally less than a cup of coffee. People with caffeine sensitivity should consume matcha chocolate in moderation. The L-theanine in matcha can help mitigate some of the negative effects of caffeine, such as jitters, but it's still important to be mindful of your individual tolerance.

**What are the potential health benefits of consuming matcha chocolate regularly?**
Regular consumption of matcha chocolate, in moderation, may offer benefits related to its antioxidant content, such as improved cognitive function, reduced inflammation, and protection against cell damage. However, it's important to note that chocolate also contains sugar and fat, so it should be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet.

I was feeling super overwhelmed and stressed out because of a project at work, and he was dealing with a lot on his end too. We both said some things we didn't mean, you know how it goes. 

The morning after, he didn't try to make some grand apology or bring a huge bouquet of flowers (which I might've expected if I wasn't so exhausted from the whole ordeal 😅). Instead, he got up early and made my favorite breakfast, leaving it on the table with a little note that simply said, ""Hope this helps start your day right. I'm sorry. ❤️"" 

It was just toast and coffee, but it meant so much more to me than any fancy gesture could've. It was like this quiet little act of service that said, ""I'm here, I care."" It really showed me how love sometimes is in these tiny moments where you just want to ease each other’s burdens. We ended up having a long talk that evening, sorting things out, and tbh, that breakfast kinda paved the way for it.

This always happens where first shot is too fast and 2nd and 3rd shot is what I end up drinking no matter the beans I use. 

My routine for La pavoni is the following:  
1. Fill the boiler till 80% water level (shown in the sight glass)  
2. Once machine is fully heated (the green light turns off) I release some steam and release water till 60\~70% water level (sight glass)  
3. After waiting 5 minutes for portafilter to be heated, I dose 15g of coffee, 10 seconds of pre-infusion and push 6\~8 bar. 

In step 3, during the 10 second pre-influsion, the 1st shot always starts prematurely with the first drop within 3 seconds, starting from the rim of the portafilter. Once I throw the 1st shot away and start 2nd shot, the first drop starts at 10 second mark during pre-infusion. 

I assumed it was water level and amount of steam within the boiler so I played around with water level (filled boiler till 50%) but it does not seem to make a huge difference. 

Any tips and ideas on why the first shot is always pulled faster than 2nd shot?

I watch her videos so much that even my husband has started to get invested in the stories….and comments often while listening! 


This is a long story but I think it’s worth the read!!!

I figured I would share my wedding story on here to give a little bit of flavor to mix in with the bridezilla stories! My husband and I dated in high school, then broke up, dated again, then broke up…..aaaannddd dated again! This time it stuck, third times the charm right?!? We lived together for about a year before we decided to get married. A good friend of mine got engaged around the same time and asked me to be her maid of honor. I happily accepted, but I did not ask her to be my maid of honor and I know she was expecting to be asked. The reason I know is because her sister asked me why I didn’t ask her to be. She would’ve been my first choice but her wedding was being planned for 4 months before mine. I wanted her to be able to concentrate on her wedding, I was able to give her plenty of time to help plan hers because I had time after hers to tie up the loose ends for my wedding. So planning for our weddings went pretty smoothly, her wedding went off without a hitch. Now on to my wedding. We had some bumps in the road but for the most part planning went well. The week of the wedding had arrived so we were finally in the home stretch!! We planned our bachelorette and bachelor parties for the weekend before the wedding. We didn’t have a “big night” planned for either of us because I was 21 and he was 20, so he wasn’t old enough to drink and I had pretty much partied myself out the previous 3 years so I wasn’t looking to get sloppy wasted! Anywho the guys all left for their night out on the town and the girls started to show up for our night. While we were waiting for everyone to show we were discussing plans for the morning of the wedding. I didn’t want to drive my car to the hair salon then to where we were getting ready so one of my bridesmaids said she would pick me up before she headed there. Once our plans were made we started discussing what we were going to do while we were out. Well I had invited a few friends who were not a part of the wedding party because…why not right. Well one of my friends showed and come to find out one of my bridesmaids, the same one who volunteered to bring me to the hair salon on the morning of the wedding, did NOT like her. That bridesmaid got very upset and left without even as much as a discussion….remember that part for later.  I wasn’t going to let that ruin my night so we gathered our things and headed out. We went out for a few hours and had dinner and a few drinks then I headed home. I got home and while I was not drunk I was a little tipsy.  I walked onto my porch and went to my door only to realize that I had not brought my keys with me🤦‍♀️ so tipsy me and a couple of the girls had to get my a/c out of my front window and climb through the window to get in. Nobody was hurt and we had a good laugh so no harm, no foul! Once the work week started things got busy and I started calling around just confirming our orders, flowers, cake, limo…that kind of stuff. Wednesday morning I called the bakery to confirm my cake order and guess what….they didn’t have record of my order! Thankfully I had my copy of the order showing what was ordered and paid for and they guaranteed the cake would be made and delivered on time. Perfect crisis averted! Thursday morning we picked up the tuxedos. We wanted to keep all of them together but didn’t want to leave them at our house because we smoke and didn’t want all of the guys showing up to the wedding smelling like cigarettes. I had the bright idea “Let’s bring them to grams house she doesn’t smoke and that’s where all of the other stuff is for the wedding” All of the other stuff being the favors, my crinoline, my shoes…the only thing that was not there was my dress which I was picking up the day of the wedding because the bridal shop was going to steam it for me. Friday morning I’m at work….yes I worked the entire week before my wedding, and my aunt calls. The first thing I hear on the other end of the line is “Are you sitting down” I hesitantly reply yes…..why. Then I hear “Grams house is on fire”……ummmmm excuse me…..WHAT?!?!?!? My first thought is did everyone make it out ok. Once I knew everyone was safe I went into panick mode. The Dr I worked for at the time told me to leave immediately and go see what going on.  I honestly don’t even remember the drive there or really anything that happened after I got there, it’s all kind of a fog. The fire dept got there within minutes and contained the fire to just a couple of rooms so the house was not a complete loss. And thankfully it was an election year, I know that seems weird to say, but the current mayor showed up not long after the fire dept did. Anything for those votes right. As soon as my mom and Grandmother saw him they ran over to him and told him that we had a wedding this weekend and the rented tuxedos were in the upstairs bedroom. The bedroom directly across from where the fire started. He immediately went over to the fire chief and told him what was going on. He sent some men upstairs to get the tuxedos to get them out of the house and hopefully save them. Believe it or not the tuxedos were pretty much unscathed, they smelled like smoke a bit, ironic after our reasoning for not keeping them at our house. We hung them on the clothes line after everything died down and sprayed them with febreeze, this is not a paid advertisement 😉, and they were as good as new. My crinoline, shoes and a good number of favors weren’t as lucky though. I headed back to work to get my things, there was no way I was finishing my day after that had happened. The Dr asked how everyone was and if we were able to save everything. I told him about the items that were lost, he handed me a few hundred dollars. He told me to take that to go buy the items that could be replaced and if he could do anything else to just let him know. I cried and thanked him before I left and sat in my car to gather myself before I left. Once I had time to put more than two thoughts together I calmed myself down, items can be replaced, people can’t be. A crinoline, shoes and some smoke damaged favors weren’t a small price to pay. I went and replaced the items I needed to then went home to prepare for the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner.  The rest of the evening was pretty uneventful, thankfully, because the wedding day wasn’t. I woke up early the next day excited to marry my best friend. My family members were picking up my wedding dress and overseeing the last minute touches to the decorations at the reception hall. I showered and got ready to head to the hair salon. I sat and waited for my ride…..she’s usually a very prompt person but we were up pretty late the prior night decorating so I figured she had over slept. We 10 minutes went by….15….20… by the time 30 minutes had gone by with no word I started to worry. I called the salon and all of the girls were there, including the person who was supposed to pick me up. When they put her on the phone I asked why she didn’t pick me up and she said “OH MY GOD I TOTALLY FORGOT I WAS SUPPOSED TO GET YOU”🤯 at that point everyone was freaking out and they finally sent someone to get me….no biggie I wasn’t going to let that ruin my special day! Little did I know while all of this was going on the people who were overseeing the last minute decorations were dealing with a crisis of their own. The reception hall ceiling had sprung a leak the prior evening and it was bad enough that the entire floor plan had to be redone to avoid guests getting wet. And the corner where the cake was supposed to be set up was where the worst of the ceiling damage was so they had to find a new spot for that. Thankfully nobody clued me in to what was going on on that end! We all had our hair and make up done and headed to my aunt house to get ready. While my bridesmaids were helping me get my dress on we heard yelling coming from the next room. My Nana, great grandma, was trapped in the room by my aunts cat, who I am pretty sure had 666 on his body somewhere hidden under his fur. Granted that wasn’t a disaster like some of the rest of the stuff but it did add some comic relief to the already hectic morning. We took our pictures and prepared to leave. I will say the ONE thing that did go in our favor that day was the limo we rented had broken down so they replaced it with the stretch limo at no extra charge….SCORE! We got to the church and with all of the craziness behind me, or so I thought, I walked down the aisle. My step dad walked my to my future husband, and we prepared to walk the steps up to our seat on the altar my husbands foot hit the table that the bread and the wine were being held on and sure enough it tipped over and the bread and the wine went all over the church floor right in front of the first pew where the groomsmen were sitting. We all chuckled, what else can you do at that point, the priest made a joke and we continued on. While the priest was speaking I went to move my arm to scratch my head and the beads on the arm of my dress got caught on the bodice of my dress. If you watch close enough in the wedding video you can see me trying to free my arm. My husband tugged on my arm to try to help and some of the strings on my sleeve broke and beads went flying all over the place! Oh well, more comic relief! Once the priest started speaking we realized he did was not doing any of the reading we carefully selected. If it wasn’t for the fact that the people I selected to do readings had copies of their own those wouldn’t have even been done! The ONLY thing my husband had input on was he wanted to just say I Do and not recite vows….he was too nervous in front of that many people to repeat vows. Well guess what the priest had us do, you guessed it, repeat the vows. We lit our unity candle and thought we were home free, that was until the priest almost caught himself on fire when his robe got caught up in the flame of the unity candle. We finished the ceremony, the priest did not do the you may now kiss the bride part, took our pictures and got ready to head to the reception. Everyone was instructed not to give my God mother any alcohol, once she started she couldn’t be stopped, well my gram and God mother jumped in the limo with us to head to the reception. When we exited the limo my God mother very slyly took the champagne bottle with her. We entered the hall, got announced, mingled with our guests then had our meals. The rest of the day is a blur but I know we had fun. My husband and I called it a night around 9pm to head to our hotel. The drama that happened at the reception happened after we left so we heard about it second hand. Apparently my Aunt left the reception with my biological dad, just to have a coffee we were told. Well my God mother, who at that point was well beyond her limit, got very upset at this and tried to slash my aunts tires with a butter knife 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️ oh and I also found out after the fact, remember when I told you to remember my bridesmaid left the bachelorette party, I was told the day after the wedding that she had found the guys and decided to join them that night. Ok not a big deal….until I found out that once she had a few drinks she decided to grab my husbands…..private area and said “Let’s see what (insert my name here) is getting”.  My husband said it was killing him to not tell me but he knew how important our wedding day was and didn’t want anything to upset me. And then once things started to go wrong he didn’t want to add to my stress so he decided he’d wait until after the wedding was done.  Also we had our wedding in October because foliage season in our area is breathtakingly beautiful and we wanted to have that as our back drop for our wedding photos….foliage season came early that year and there were absolutely ZERO leaves left on the trees by the time our wedding took place🤷‍♀️ So there is the looong story about our wedding day. Basically just about anything that could go wrong did go wrong. BUT the only thing that mattered to me was marrying my best friend and now we have an out of the ordinary wedding tale to tell! If you made it to the end…. Thank you ❤️

Edit to add: I can’t believe I forgot to add in that the “toss bouquet” was never delivered so I used one of the bridesmaids flowers when we came to that part of the evening. And even after so she explicitly told NO when asked my God mother took one of the roses from my bouquet to place at the feet of one of the statues for good luck at the church and by the time the pictures were finished my bouquet had completely fallen apart. Apparently the one rose she took was pretty much the center of where the many roses were bunched together.",3,1749962447.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,6,1.0,False
1lbrwwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/1lbrwwo/groomer/,Groomer,"Hi, it’s been a long time since I posted here. I just wanna share this story about our mwa, let’s name him R.

R was our last mwa— he was the jolliest mwa we ever had, but there’s just something in him that irritates me and idk what it is. He has never said any flirty words, but I can feel he’s a perv just by the way he talks and acts towards me (I’m in my early 20s and I heard he’s in his 30s already).

He invited me to go to a café near our place, I said yes at first because I thought we’re going with the other constituents in our group— turns out he just wanted to have a coffee with me only. He then told me his change of plans and sent me a TikTok video of a staycation around our area, saying that we’re just going to watch on Netflix and chill— I never said yes, but he kept on bringing it up, so I always make excuses. We didn’t go through with all those plans, by the way.

Ff. He got excommunicated a few days ago because he was caught having a relationship with a 16-year old girl. From what I heard, the child’s father will be demoted from his position as a minister because of this. R was sent back to where he originally came from and the girl’s family plans to sue him because they had just found out about their relationship.

What should I do?,"I think I am overthinking but I don't want to be creepy despite doing something a little creepy. I went to a meet-up where we played bored games at a cafe. It was my first time and I went because I don't have any friends my age and I also didn't want to be a hermit. My uber was late so I got to the event late and by then everyone had already grouped up to play. My social anxiety was like you might as well go home but I had already spent 15 bucks to get here and I knew if I went home right away my roomate would make fun of me. Anyway I stay order a disgusting coffee and sit on the sidelines trying hype myself up to ask to join one of the groups on the next round. In walks Jay (fake name, 20). He is tall, dark, handsome, he sits at the table. Once I see another late person I finally ask can I join the next round she says no but suggest I play with Jay. Jay sniles and I smile back he is sitting across from me and she suggest we play a card game. I thought it was going to be the two of us in walks another guy R who asks if he can join us. We say the more the merrier. R proceeds to decimate us at all of the games. I liked that despite losing Jay remained calm and respectful (I know that is the bare minimum but hey). He seemed funny and quiet. When moved tables I sat next to him. To be honest he didn't do anything special, I just thought he was cute. We finish playing all of the games and Jay mentions it was his first time too and thought it was a weekly event. It is actually only monthly which is a bummer because I think we both had fun. Then once the game was finished Jay had to use the restroom. Once done he came out the bathroom and said bye. We were starting another round of different game so I didn't get to ask for his contact info. Also my social anxiety probably wouldn't have let me. 

Here is the creepish part. On meet up you can go to the connections tab and see all of the people who went to the meeting then you select three people you want to connect with. On Jay's Connection profile he put his full name. I also have my full name on meet up. This lead me down the rabbit hole of looking him up. I found him on Instagram and Facebook. He is basically a ghost on social media. He has only 74 friends on Facebook. We weirdly have one random mutual which is a girl I went to high-school with and he went to college with. He has zero posts on both. When I googled him him LinkedIn came up and it said he graduated in 2021, I graduated in 2016. Which tracks because the girl I went to high-school with was a freshman when I was a senior.

It feels weird to reach out to him via social media because it doesn't look like he is active on social media and I never asked him for this info. But I also don't want to wait because what if he never goes to another board game meeting. I think he is attractive, I doubt he would think I am attractive because I am plus size and not in a curvy way. I wear a 4x and I am trying to lose the weight while gaining confidence. I have never dated anyone before, I haven't even had my first kiss. I normally am not even attracted to men, and I am normally asexual. This was weird that I like him and I don't know if he liked me because I have trouble reading social cues. I have never been liked before. No experience in flirting, I was too busy in high school to date. Then I spent my early 20's being a caregiver to my mom. At 26 this is the first time in my life that I am trying to make friends and maybe even a boyfriend. 


TLDR: How do I give this guy I played board games with my number?

I have an old Magnifica S that is fine but recently feeling like the coffee is just not what I am wanting. And the milk system seems far less superior to the new ones. I started looking at super auto with a frothing wand. But I decided against it. I like the idea of the rivelias dual bean hopper for my decaf and I hear it tastes great. But I also though about going with something more traditional yet I don't want to grind, weight, tamp etc. as we have young kids. Insert the breville touch impress. It feels like the best of both worlds. Wanting opinions. I am not a coffee snob per say but even my magnifica is better than most coffee shops where I live. I also am super remote so this gives me a coffee fix without driving an hour to a cafe. I use freshly roasted beans. Prefer light but have had to go more medium recently. I like the idea of a little more control but still mostly automatic. But also love the one button press and done. I just am wanting a bit more, but still not ready for the hassle/new hobby. I drink mostly cappuccino or flat white. I feel like the more I read people suggest going to Bambino plus with a grinder, but I just don't want to spend forever dialing it in. At the most I would be okay with I grinder that once I set gives me the amount I need so I don't have to weigh.

1lbrvs2,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1lbrvs2/if_you_cant_make_it_on_time_or_relatively_close/,"If you can‘t make it on time or relatively close to when something is scheduled, then schedule it to something you can make or inform the person.","This is not to say you can‘t be like 15 minutes or even 30 minutes late. I get it stuff happens in life things go wrong, or a bus is late/you miss it. Those things can delay you by 15-30 minutes.

Just saying to try to make it on time. If you can‘t then inform who you’re meeting.

Some hypotheticals to give an idea of what I mean by my post title and on what I’m referring to. 

A person messes up and doesn’t wake up to their alarm, and from the current time knows they‘re gonna be an hour late (says nothing). A person lives far away, and is gonna take long to get somewhere (completely fine, just plan your time well), comes super late because they live far away (why not say a later time you know can make instead of something unrealistically early knowing you can‘t make it).

Like the previous scenarios are fine, stuff happens after all. But come on plan well and give times you can make, and if something happens tell people. 

This is because I‘d say it‘s rude to wilfully waste people‘s times, and it sucks not knowing where someone is, while you‘re waiting for them. So I‘d say people should try and inform just out of common courtesy for the other party.

Telling someone that you‘re gonna be late is really so that if someone is running late anybody that‘s already there can realize the person might take a while, and can then go for stroll or something, maybe get a coffee to pass the time waiting for the person without potentially wasting their time when they do arrive. 

I say this because personally if I‘m supposed to meet with someone I try to stay at the meet-up location even if they‘re late because I view it as a sort of social agreement that, that‘s the time by where everybody is supposed to be. So let‘s say I‘m supposed to meet someone by 3:00pm, and it‘s past that I still stay, just in case they randomly show up some time after. But if someone informs me they‘ll be x amount late, I can go spend x amount doing something else to pass the time instead of boringly waiting.

But scenario two I‘d say is just very rude and I don‘t understand. Let’s say it takes someone two hours to get to somewhere and they can only leave at like let’s say 2:00pm, please do not say to meet at 3:00pm. Because a lot of people (me) will show-up at 3:00pm expecting you there, if you can‘t make it at 3:00pm, then say 4:00pm. Like nothing wrong with living far away and having to take extra time to get somewhere just plan properly to get somewhere on time, don‘t say some early time you can‘t make. I don‘t get why people do that, but I swear it is so common.

1lbrpxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/justpoetry/comments/1lbrpxd/rat_race/,Rat Race 🐀🐁🏁,"Overwhelmed

Overworked

Underpaid

Frustrated every day

On the verge of a mental breakdown every other day

But hey, like Smashing Pumpkins once said

“Despite all my rage I’m still just a rat in a cage”

In this rat race, I want to escape

I feel like Simple Plan

“Welcome to My Life”

But the plan isn’t so simple

It’s unpredictable

Miserable

I’m not invincible

Yet I try to be

I guess that will have to suffice

Sike!

Should I take a chance and roll the dice?

Or play it safe and “hide”?

I feel like each day a piece of me dies

Deep inside I want to cry

I feel like a slave

I feel like my world is caving in

All I crave is peace

But instead, I’m exhausted and tired

I’m so sick and tired of being tired

Wired off the coffee

But I need another cup

Fill it up please

Anxiety inside of me

Depression too

But what am I to do?

I have to keep pushing through

Even though I don’t want to

When does it end?

Trading time for money

Until I’m dead and buried

It’s scary

Lost and confused

Trying to figure out my next move

I pray that I do soon

So, I don’t become consumed

In a dark place that I hate

That can’t be my fate

I have to escape this rat race!

### **Why Silence is Your Competitive Edge**  
🔇 **Stop Announcing - Start Building**  
- Every hour spent tweeting ""coming soon"" is an hour not spent coding/selling  
- My first $10k came from *shipping*, not posting  

🎯 **Observe Problems in Silence**  
- Best business ideas come from listening (not talking):  
  - Overheard complaints at coffee shops → Solved with a SaaS  
  - Noticed inefficiencies in my day job → Built a tool, then sold it back to them  

### **How to Weaponize Silence**  
1️⃣ **The 6-Month Radio Silence Rule**  
- No ""building in public"" until you have:  
  - 100 real users  
  - $1k+ in revenue  
2️⃣ **Stealth Mode Research**  
- Join forums/subreddits *without revealing your plans*  
- Document frustrations people casually mention  
3️⃣ **Let Results Speak**  
- My ""overnight success"" took 14 months of silent iteration  

### **When to Finally Break Silence**  
✅ You have a working product (not an idea)  
✅ Customers are begging for more (not polite ""cool idea!"")  
✅ Competitors start copying you (then it's time to scale noise)  ",0,1749961199.0,microsaas,2,0.42,False

Woof, what an ending.  So horrible on so many levels.  Forced to use a garbage end game gun against hordes of robots that don't take any appreciable damage from anything else even though there's a cutscene where Rigby takes them out with just a few bullets. Why is the end game gun so horrible?  If you get too close to level geometry while not in cover it automatically gets pointed at the air and loses the charge. Nice touch that you can charge it without aiming, though I wonder if it's intentional.  The writing goes off the rails, pulling out all the done to death sci-fi ideas and throwing them at the wall to see what sticks with Morrison evolving into his final form of a deus ex machina. Guess that coffee *was* pretty good.  They just kept tacking more and more things on to the Kin so that by the end they are: a dimension dwelling, died in the past after crash landing on Earth that created humans, yet exist outside time and space, and chose this moment in time when humans made robots to take them over as a virus and left their unlimited power source lying around until the robots can slow walk into a portal to come back to Earth to harvest the humans they created. Cliche moments to the point where I make a gun with my finger, point it at the screen, shoot and then laugh because sure enough, boss lady gets shot a couple seconds later, then just walks it off for the ending with a jaunty ""I'm feeling pretty good!""  Boring post unskippable credits scene with Rigby some how mistaking Jacob for his D3 drone. Oh wait, let me guess writers, Jacob is the robot that stands up? *\*yawn\**

Game definitely has some laughs and funny scenes(I loved Lily getting called out as Morrison's sex robot and what happens when she finally activates) but the gaps from the switch from an open world game into a linear one are pretty glaring. Lots of missing or cut content.  Woman you flirt on the phone with a few times is your love by the time she gets fridged(nice touch only putting her body on the ground below though!). The speed run the devs made adding the out of bounds spheres kills exploration. Neither a pyramid nor a ziggurat, at least let us explore it all!

Not worth $60.
