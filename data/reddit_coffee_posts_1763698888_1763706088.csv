1p2r9q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/restaurants/comments/1p2r9q6/what_restaurants_are_near_carolina_opry_in_myrtle/,What restaurants are near Carolina Opry in Myrtle Beach?,"A lot of locals and tourists heading to the Carolina Opry ask about good breakfast nearby, so here are a few places that I breakdown from my experience.Been in the area about 10 minutes away and eat around here pretty often, so this might help if you’re new here.

Most of these places are easy to reach and don’t feel like a touristy. Here is the list that I breakdown,

1. Blueberry’s Grill: About 1.3 miles from the Opry. Takes maybe 3 minutes by car or around 20 minutes walking. Good spot for brunch, food’s always fresh and the people working there are nice. They’ve got good parking too, even that time it’s busy.
2. Lulu’s Cafe: About 6 miles away, roughly a 20-minute drive. Classic beach diner, small place with good coffee and nice people working there.
3. Johnny D’s Waffles: Around 5 miles from the Opry. They’re known for waffles (red velvet the favorite). It’s usually busy, but service moves fast.
4. Eggs Up Grill: About 4.9 miles. Simple food, clean place, and always quick. Perfect if you just want eggs, bacon, and coffee without a wait.
5. Mammy’s Kitchen: About 6.9 miles out, closer to the main strip. They do a breakfast buffet. Food’s fine, but it’s more about quantity than flavor. Parking can be tight on weekends.

If you want something close and actually worth it, Blueberry’s Grill is the easy choice. It’s the closest, has real food made from scratch, and the staff’s always friendly. The servers there are honestly some of the nicest around, always polite, quick, and make you feel welcome every time you visit.",1,1763705959.0,restaurants,0,1.0,False

1p2r7xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogueInc/comments/1p2r7xe/8bitdo_controller_first_impressions/,8BitDo Controller first impressions,"Today I received my Analogue 3D (in White, to California) and I was excited to try out the 8BitDo controller with it. The main thing I always check on a new controller is latency and connection; With that being said, this controller immediately showed major flaws in these 2 areas.   
  
If any objects are in the way of the controller and the console, there is intermittent latency and even full disconnects. I sat on my couch (about 5-6 feet away) and even that distance with only a coffee table with a few items on it was enough to feel the latency. When i tested even just an empty cardboard box on the table, the intermittent latency got significantly worse and even fully disconnected at certain points. If you want a guaranteed way to replicate what I mean, try sitting and then putting the controller on your lap with your legs up in front of it. Another way is to simply put the controller behind your back and test the inputs/connection that way. For me, 100% of the time it was have major connection issues and/or disconnect when doing this test. 

Now, I know some people might say that they haven't had issues, or they don't play in those stations, but that doesn't mean it's not a major design flaw for people that do/will notice these issues. Do these same tests with. say, a PS5 controller or a Switch Pro controller and you'll see that you can put it behind whatever you want, or even go into another room and they will work flawlessly. 

As an experiment, I tested my 8BitDo N64 Controller Mod Kit that I installed into one of my OEM N64 controllers and, ironically, it works FLAWLESSLY. I can go to the back of the room, behind a wall and the controller still feels great wirelessly. I did the same tests and this kit passed with flying colors. Also, I'm not sure if this has been mentioned in reviews or posts here, but this mod kit connects DIRECTLY to the Analogue 3D without the need for a dongle. Also, it can turn on the console the same way the official 8BitDo controller does!

I'm writing this post to hopefully shed more light on this major issue with the New controller since I haven't seen many people talking about it. I did see WULFF DEN briefly mention it in his review but many other reviews I've seen only praise the new controller. I was excited and liked the feel of the new controller, but the connection issues are a definite deal breaker to me, I a expect more people will be mentioning it as they have more playtime with the console and controller. 

If you have any more info, experience, and/or questions about this issue, I'm down to do more tests or answer whatever questions y'all have! Thanks for reading :)",1,1763705784.0,AnalogueInc,0,1.0,False

1p2r652,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p2r652,Tonecheer mini event Giverny Garden,"The elements and direction I took was really inspired by online photos of the real place. Would love to visit one day. Searching for reference photos lead me to this wonderful site - alamy.com

What I changed:

Land forms - the back one is from scratch. The other two I just made thicker by stacking and gluing cardboard, paper macheing the edges and painting. Matched the level up to the house minus the step beneath which I replaced to go in front. This allowed me to make the pond a bit deeper without messing up the structure other than trimming one of the bottom supports.

Pond is covered in water paste gel, a glossy glaze and pearlescent paints

Bamboo from wire, cheap light/foamy type air dry clay and paint then covered ground with coffee grounds and leaves

Replaced lamp post with wisteria tree from wire that I bent and twisted then covered mostly in paste and partly paper mache. Cut up an artificial plant for the wisteria flowers, lightly painted and super glued to branches 

Paper mached the lamp wire then painted to look like a vine and made a wood looking lantern

To replace the bench, I pricked small holes and glued flowers (I had) and grass (made of twine rope I frayed and painted).

Ued two different shades of acrylic markers to change colour of the porch and bridge (since I really loved this from reference photos). Also laid cut up and painted coffee stirrer sticks on top of the bridge.

Replaced frame around mirror to a simple border I cut up and painted

I glued leaves I had for the ivy on the house (just added some green string stuff beneath to make it thicker in parts) and added few different flowers some with beads for the pots. The calla lily leaves is a small plastic artificial shrub that I matte mod podged then painted; flowers from leftover pink stamens from another kit and coffee filters I cut up.

Replaced wisteria on top with wire covered with more green string and flowers in front

What a lovely kit. Thank you Tonecheer, pluck for organising, other participants and the community for all the ideas!",2,1763705612.0,booknooks,1,1.0,False

Integrated writing is fine-ish, but the **independent writing** is destroying me.  
Some days I write 370 words and it feels good, other days I write 380 and it reads like a toddler trying to give a TED talk. I cannot tell if I’m improving or just typing faster.

I used the code **IND4859784** when registering  and got a discount + free prep materials + a bunch of mock tests and honestly those mock tests are the only reason I haven’t collapsed yet, so sharing it in case someone else needs it.

Anyway please tell me I’m not the only one fighting for my life against the writing section. 🙃

1p2r0yy,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1p2r0yy/stuck_in_my_head_overthinking_wrecked_my_focus/,"Stuck in My Head: Overthinking Wrecked My Focus, Confidence, and Memory","**TL;DR**

* Two years of overthinking about a friend spiraled into anxiety, poor sleep, and scattered focus.
* I lost study momentum, missed details, paused job hunt for military service, and now back to interviews, doesn't feel like I'll succeed it as year of unconnected from field knowledge.

I am 23 (M), Two years ago I slid into overthinking. Couldn’t stop thinking about a girl, and we interned at the same place. I don’t even know when it started. The more I tried to understand her, the more doubt I created. I started second-guessing everything I said, avoiding eye contact, and when someone asked me something I wasn’t sure about, I’d pause too long because I was scared I’d answer badly. When I started overthinking, I’d throw on a podcast or music just to keep my brain from looping back flush of any thought.



Studying changed too. I lack focus. Practice didn’t stay in my head like before. I also had a project then and kept missing details.



Back then sleep was trash. I lived in a windowless room, worked where I slept, and I was on rolazepam/lemborexant each for a month. I drank two 16-oz double-shot Americanos a day, I stopped drinking coffee after the doctor prescribed. Even now, if I have coffee around 10–11 a.m., I’m wide awake past midnight.



I tried meeting with psychotherapist. It didn’t “fix” things, but it did nudge me to change some habits. After I graduated, I stopped going. I don’t see her anymore either. There was one of my bad moment: I got really drunk and said something rude to her without realizing. I apologized, and then cut contact.



Then I was on teaching job for a year. Making slides ate my whole life. Even taking 10 minutes to eat felt like I was stealing time from prep. Near the end of the contract I barely wanted to get out of bed. Since then the “drive” to sit and grind for long stretches hasn’t really come back. Deadlines slipped.



Mandatory military service made the job prep paused, academic side being cast off. Six months away from studying, under pressure, getting scolded—came back and didn’t feel as sharp. The one thing that stayed solid is my English; I’m still confident there.



Interviews are where the slowdown shows. I get to compare myself in year 3 I was prepped hard. Now, I can have an interview in an hour and feel nothing. In the room my brain cramps: question comes in → mind goes blank → I pause 2–3 seconds → force myself to answer. Before interviews I can spend hours prepping and still not land on clear answer to prep question. Under pressure I cramp up but when alone in non-stress situation, answers flow.



Right now my head feels… empty sometimes. Not many thoughts. I have to force myself to think for a bit before I can give an answer I actually like. I used to form sentences as soon as someone finished talking; now I can listen and feel like nothing’s processing.



Why is this happening? But I’m trying to climb out. Avoid doomscrolling, more books and exercise, fixing sleep, and slowly building back routines. If anyone’s been here—overthinking → slower thinking → memory not sticking—how did you turn it around?",1,1763705100.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

1p2qz49,https://i.redd.it/vrbdud59wj2g1.jpeg,Showing Pride how fast I am.,"*The late-afternoon sun was just starting to dip, painting the Tracen Academy track in warm orange. Most of the girls were cooling down, the air full of soft chatter and the fading echo of footbeats. Ellerslie Pride wasn’t cooling down. She stood at the edge of the track with her arms folded, silver-blue tail swishing in a sharp, annoyed rhythm, eyes narrowed at the boy in the tracksuit in front of her.

“Say that again,” *she said, voice cool, almost too polite.* “You. Beat. Moonlight Lunacy. In a foot race.”

*Mark scratched the back of his neck, looking almost guilty instead of proud.* “Uh… yeah? I mean, it wasn’t like, official–official. She wanted me, I ran, I won. That’s… how races work, right?”

*Ellerslie’s ear flicked.*

“She’s one of the fastest Umamusume ever. She runs with pride, with discipline, with purpose. She’s built to run. You’re—” she gave him a long up-and-down look, “—a human boy whose warm-up jog looks like he’s late to class.”

*Mark put a hand over his heart.* “Wow. Vicious. I do great late-to-class jogs, thank you.”

*She didn’t even crack a smile.* “This is important. If my trainer claims to be faster than the ‘beautiful star of Britain’ and it turns out to be an exaggeration, that reflects poorly on me as well. I refuse to be associated with cheap bragging.”

*Mark blinked.* “Cheap—okay, ouch, that’s twice now.” *He exhales, glancing at the track, then back at her.*

“Alright, fine,” *he said, rolling his shoulders.* “You wanna see it, I’ll show you. One lap. You watch, analyze, judge, whatever it is scary-cool overseas rivals do.”

“I am not scary,” *she muttered. Then, after a beat:* “But I am an analyst. And I intend to verify every claim.”

*She stepped closer, eyes sharp.* “No tricks. No head start. Keep your line tight on lane one. If you cut corners, I will notice.”

“Jeez, Pride, relax,” *Mark laughed, then corrected himself when she arched a brow.* “I mean—yes ma’am. Full honesty, no corner-cutting, teacher will be proud, etcetera.”

*He stepped onto the track, shoes crunching lightly on the surface. The other Umamusume nearby started watching, sensing something interesting about to happen.*

*Ellerslie moved to the inside rail, bracing her hands lightly on it as if she were studying a specimen.*
“You said you beat Moonlight Lunacy in a hundred-meter dash?”

“Yeah. But I’ll do four hundred for you so it doesn’t feel like a fluke.”

“How generous,” *she replied dryly.* “Very well, Grayson. Show me this ‘incredible speed’ that felled the star of Britain.”

*Mark walked to the starting line, bending forward in a runner’s stance. His heart thudded a little faster. Don’t overdo it, he reminded himself. No sonic booms. No craters in the track. Just… fast enough. He raised one hand.* “You wanna count it down?”

*She straightened, tail flicking once.* “Very well.”

*She lifted one finger.* “On your marks.”

*Mark settled in, fingers brushing the lane, eyes focused straight ahead.*

“Get set…”

*He took a breath. The world around him seemed to quiet for a second.*

“Go.”

*He moved.*

*To the other girls, it was just a blur. To Ellerslie Pride, trained eyes and racing instincts honed on elite competition, it was something else entirely.
His start was explosive—no wasted motion, no lag between the call and the first step. By the time his second foot hit the ground, he was already at a speed most humans would need ten, fifteen strides to build. Her eyes widened a fraction. Acceleration… that steep? In two steps? He hugged the curve of lane one perfectly, each stride landing with uncanny precision. No heavy thuds, just rapid, clean contact, like the ground barely had time to remember he’d been there. By the first hundred meters, he should have been visibly straining. He… wasn’t. His breathing looked comfortable, his posture relaxed, and his speed was still climbing.*

“What…?” *she whispered under her breath.*

*Her analytical mind scrambled to categorize him—sprinter, middle-distance, something—but the numbers weren’t making sense. Humans had limits. Even enhanced ones. This was more like…*

“Is he… still accelerating?” *one of the nearby Umamusume murmured.*

*By two hundred meters, Mark was a streak, hair and tracksuit whipping in the wind of his own making. He eased off just slightly—enough to keep the air from shuddering around him—then surged again on the final straight, as if simulating a finishing spurt. Ellerslie’s hand tightened on the rail. Her tail, for the first time, stopped swishing and simply lifted in shock.*

**His final kick… looks like Lunacy’s…**

*He crossed the finish line, skidding a few steps as he consciously slowed himself, coming down from that unnatural velocity. He turned on his heel, walking back toward her at a normal jog, like nothing was strange. The stopwatch app on her phone—which she’d started without him noticing—was still on-screen. She stared at the time.*

“This… is not possible,” *she murmured.* “That pace… even if you mis-timed the start, that is still… no. No, this is not within human parameters.”

*Mark stopped in front of her, only a bit flushed, breathing barely elevated.* “So…?” *he asked, lopsided grin tugging at his lips.* “Do I still ‘look like I’m late to class’?”

*She frowned down at the screen, then back up at him, ears angled forward sharply.* “Explain.”

“That’s your reaction?” *he laughed.* “Not ‘wow, Mark, you’re amazing,’ not ‘I am humbled by your overwhelming power’? Just ‘explain’?”

“This is my reaction when presented with impossible data,” *she said, stepping closer, eyes narrowing in fascinated irritation.* “Your stride length, turnover rate, and visible effort do not match the recorded time. There is a discrepancy.”

*She tapped her phone.* “This is a time I would expect from a world-class Umamusume sprinting at near full power, not from a… from a—” *she paused, searching for a word that wouldn’t sound insulting,* “—from a boy who drinks canned coffee like it’s water and falls asleep on the bench sometimes.”

*Mark pressed a hand dramatically to his chest.* “Wow, you really have been watching me.”

“That is not the point.”

“Kind of sounds like the point.”

“Grayson.”

*He chuckled, then softened, rubbing his neck again.* “Okay, look. You wanted to know if I actually outran Moonlight Lunacy. You’ve got eyes. You’ve got your little race computer thing. What do you think now?”

*She looked back at the track, replaying the run in her mind. Moonlight’s posture, her drive, the way she cuts the wind. Then Mark’s. Different forms, same brutal reality.*

“…I believe,” *she said slowly, each word heavy,* “that if she lost to that, she may complain about it, but she has no right to call it unfair.”

*She met his eyes. “I also believe that whatever you are, you are not just a ‘human boy.’”

*Mark considered that, then smiled, a touch more gently.* “I’m your trainer. Isn’t that enough for now?”

*Her lips parted, ready to argue… then she stopped. The way he’d phrased it, the casual confidence behind it—it settled something inside her she hadn’t realized was tense.*

“…For now,” *she conceded.* “But I will obtain answers eventually. That is my nature.”

“I figured,” *he said.* “You’re ‘Pride,’ right? Kind of comes with the name.”

*She huffed, a faint hint of color on her cheeks.*
“You are insufferable.”

“And yet, you’re still standing here.”

*She looked away, tail flicking again—this time less irritated, more flustered.* “I remain because I must recalibrate my expectations. My current training plans may be… insufficient, given that my trainer can apparently outrun half the academy.”

*He grinned.* “Oh, so you trust me a little now.”

“I trust empirical evidence,” *she corrected. Then, almost too quietly* “And… I will admit, it is reassuring to know my trainer will not ask me to do anything he himself could not at least attempt.”

*Mark tilted his head.* “That’s what you were worried about?”

*She stared at the track.* “I came here to challenge Japan. To challenge Oguri Cap, Moonlight Lunacy, all of them. I require a trainer who understands what it means to push beyond limits… not one who merely orders me to exceed his imagination.”

*He blinked, then gave a small, genuine smile.* “Well,” *he said,* “if it’s pushing limits you’re worried about, I’ve got a lot of experience in… falling face-first past them.”

*She shot him a look.* “That does not sound reassuring.”

“It is, actually. Trust me. I know what breaking looks like. I’m not going to let you hit that point.” *He reached out and, after a brief hesitation, gently rested his hand on her shoulder.* “You wanna beat Lunacy? Oguri? Everyone back home? I’ll run you through whatever it takes. I’ll be there. Every lap.”

*Ellerslie’s ears flicked, this time in something like embarrassment. She looked at his hand, then back up at him.*

“…You speak like a reckless fool,” *she said softly* “But your data is… convincing.”

“That your poetic way of saying I’ve ‘won you over’?” *he teased.*

*She stepped back, lightly shrugging his hand off, but there was the tiniest smile at the corner of her lips now.* “Do not get ahead of yourself, Grayson. You have merely… moved from ‘suspicious braggart’ to ‘questionable superhuman asset.’”

*Mark laughed.* “Progress is progress. I’ll take it.”

*She glanced at the track again.* “One more run,” *she said.* “This time, you pace me. I want to feel the exact difference between your ‘comfortable’ speed and my current top gear.”

*He blinked.* You wanna race with me now?”

“This is called ‘applied research,’” *she replied primly* “Unless you are suddenly tired?”

*He rolled his shoulders, already moving back toward the line.* “Tired? Nah. Just don’t complain when you can’t feel your legs after.”

*She walked up beside him, hooves clicking on the track, eyes bright and sharp.* “If I cannot feel my legs,” *Ellerslie Pride said, a spark of genuine excitement finally cutting through her composure* “then it means I’ve discovered a new threshold. You are my trainer. It is your job to help me reach it.”

*Mark grinned, settling into position.* “Alright then, Pride,” *he said.* “Let’s find out just how fast you can really go.”

**This time, when she counted them down, there was no doubt in her voice—only anticipation.**

The owner legit said that her goal is to have a place that felt like everyone was friends. I was into it for a while and even started getting close with my manager (both women, fully platonic). Recently however, we had a disagreement about me feeling overworked and under supported, both by her and our shift leads. She was attempting to soft quit at the time and recommended me for her position. I was covering for her a lot because more money and promotion!! Stupid of me to trust her but she tried to spin it to seem like I was slacking despite doing the work of two people. She was supposed to recommend they give me a raise, but it’s been over a month and nothing. Needless to say, I haven’t felt the same about the job since. 

I’m burnt out, I’m checked out and I’m gonna admit that I’ve been slipping in performance and professionalism. I was talking to a shift lead after work one day, and mentioned that I was thinking of quitting. I shouldn’t have said that but oh well, I can’t undo that. Lately though, I’ve noticed that another lead he’s close with has been getting a little bossy with me. I know she’s hoping for an ASM position in a different location (the owner has  another cafe and a brunch spot in the area) and I noticed she was getting a little bossy with me last time we worked together. 

I know I fucked up but I’m finding it hard to care. All other places owned by the same person have a much more relaxed vibe about them. Because of this, I feel like the pressure my manager put on me is unnecessary. It’s coffee, most people are in their early to mid 20s, there’s not a professional energy to it at all. But I also don’t like the idea of someone thinking my position is up for grabs. So what do I do to rectify this in the meantime? I was thinking of apologizing to the lead for even discussing it, but subtly hinting that I’m not leaving/my position is not available. I know I have myself to blame but IM finding want to prove a point, but in a way that’s not hostile. What do I do? ",1,1763704450.0,WorkAdvice,0,1.0,False

https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mozu02/my_story/

I just thought it was a good time to make another post.

I ended my last post with starting shakes. As some of you suggested in the comments it was not something that everyone could do. After trialing the shakes for a short time. It was not something I could do. I could not enjoy the taste of them no matter how hard I tried.

On a side not I tried a few different protein bars and I have actually found a few that I do like. And they just so happy to contain almost 50grams on protein In them. So ive been eating those about 5 days a week whilst at work and not on the weekends. I have also added protein water to my diet and entirely removed coffee. So with my lunch I am drinking a 600ML of those and that contains another 30grams of protein. Ive continued this diet pretty much since starting it.

Ive hit a few goals since day 189. At day 213, i did my first ever park run on a weekend. For those who have never heard of this, they are events held every weekend that are community walks or runs, where it is 5km. Ive gone every week except one since starting those. Some weeks I walk, other I try my best. But last week I hit my new personal best, 35minuts and 55 seconds. Which to some may not be great, but to me is unreal. I've now participated in 9 runs and even volunteered with them once. 

Another goal I have hit since my last update was on day 275. I did my first ever full push up. In nearly my 31 years of life. I have achieved a push up. I then tried to see how many I could do consecutive and it was 5, poor form on the last 2, but im ecstatic. 

The last goal i have achieved is today. Day 289. 

I started my journey at 157.7 Kg 
Today I have had my first ever reading of 99.7kg. I have now officially hit double digits. Now ofcourse over the next couple weeks it will fluctuate, but I am absolutely in awe. 

My family have been supportive and some of them have been actively now trying to follow suit. My life has been improved in spades. 2025 is officially my year and it is all thanks to my Doctor who set me on this path.

Need advice on how to deal with my feelings.,"TLDR; Fresher in college. Both of us are part of the music society. Did not know she was already in an LDR before falling for her. We are very good friends. Skip to questions.

I (19M) am a fresher and part of the college music society, and I have a huge crush on another member (19F) for the past 5 months and I had been giving her subtle hints. But recently I found out she is already in an LDR for about a year now. I am heartbroken and can't even distance myself from her because we have several events coming up so we practice almost daily. Every time I see her I cry internally and struggle a lot to hide my sadness. What's worse is we are really good friends, like she slaps my back when joking, have one to one practice sessions, we have coffee and snacks together, both of us are really good in our acads and often study together at the library or the practice room. I just knew we had a dynamic going. The LDR was a bombshell and now I realize she saw me as just a good friend and nothing more.

I have always been very empathetic towards others but I can't help but wish that her current relationship fails. It's been more than 10 days since I found out about her relationship and acting normal around her as if nothing happened is way too draining for me. My friend group is not really good at giving out relationship advice so I am turning to you guys.

Here are my questions:

1. How do I attend daily practice sessions without breaking down?
2. How do I stop thinking about her? I haven't been able to focus on my work, and it's damaging my productivity.
3. I don't want to lose such a good friend. How do I stop seeing her this way? How do I continue keeping our relationship as it is without falling for her?

When we were friends, my mom and her mom used to be friends. My friends moms entire Facebook account was dedicated to posting about her daughters success. We were 10, so it was all of her soccer awards, all of her school awards ect. 

Fast forward today, I'm now 25, so is my old friend. My mom died when I was 21. I used to have all of the support in the world from my mom. I was loved. Then I was thrown to the wolves and thrown into being a fully independent adult without any warning. Before my mom died I started my own business which failed after my mom died due to my depression. Now I work at a coffee shop. 

When I saw my old friend, who now works in the medical field (I think she's a nurse), she had this smug look on her face like ""ha look where you're at and look where I'm at"".

How successful I could've been, or maybe not even successful, but having a support system , and not be drowning from life all of the time.

I'm burnt out from work , I have no where to turn, I just want my mom. It's not fair. I'm so mad at the world.

1p2qlyr,https://youtu.be/zoQU4acdGNU,4 Very Scary TRUE Remote Cabin Sitter Horror Stories,"# ""The Quiet Place"":

I took a job maintaining a cluster of remote desert cabins in California’s backcountry a couple summers ago. They sat miles off any marked road—just dry flats, scattered boulders, and heat that pressed on you like a hand. My duties were simple: greet guests, restock water tanks, patch anything that broke. The owner lived in the city and checked in by phone every few days to make sure everything hadn’t caught fire or blown away.

The cabins were basic: wood, corrugated metal, small porches. I stayed in the smallest one by the entrance, equipped with a battered radio and an old Jeep for the long haul into town.

During one particularly hot stretch, a man named David booked Cabin 4 for a week. He showed up alone in a dusty pickup, hauling fishing gear and a couple books.

“Just need quiet time,” he told me while I checked him in. “Work’s been… rough.”

“Plenty of quiet out here,” I said. “Water tank’s full. Radio me if anything comes up.”

He nodded, then mostly kept to himself.

Another couple—Ron and his wife, Linda—rented Cabin 2 that same week. They wanted hiking and seclusion.

“Nice spot you’ve got here,” Ron said, shaking my hand. “Exactly the kind of nowhere we were looking for.”

Linda asked about trails. I warned them to stay on marked ones; the desert doesn’t give second chances if you get turned around. They listened.

Everything stayed peaceful at first. I’d see David reading on his porch, and Ron and Linda heading out early each morning.

Then the small things started.

One morning, I found the tool-shed door hanging open with the latch bent. Nothing missing, but fresh boot prints in the sand—bigger than any of the guests’. I chalked it up to wind or my own forgetfulness, repaired it, and moved on.

Later that afternoon, David came by while I was filling water jugs.

“Last night I saw someone near my cabin,” he said. “Tall guy. Scruffy. When I stepped outside he was gone.”

“Probably a hiker who wandered too far,” I told him. “I’ll check around.”

He accepted that, but something in his eyes said he wasn’t convinced.

Ron mentioned something similar the next day—scraping sounds at his window long after dark.

“I’ll keep an eye out,” I promised.

I radioed the owner. “Might have a trespasser.”

“Call the sheriff if it gets worse,” he said. “Desert attracts odd ones sometimes.”

By then the unease had spread to the guests. Linda came to me pale, saying she’d seen a man standing far off in the heat shimmer watching their cabin before slipping behind a ridge.

I drove the entire boundary road that evening. Nothing. No movement. No prints I hadn’t already seen.

When night fell, I stayed up with the lights low, listening.

Then a single gunshot cracked through the air—sharp, unmistakable—from the direction of Cabin 4.

I grabbed my flashlight and sprinted.

David’s door stood wide. He lay collapsed inside, blood spreading beneath him, chest torn open from a close-range shot. He was gone before I even knelt down.

I backed out fast and radioed the sheriff. “Man down. Gunshot victim. Send units now.”

I ran to check on Ron and Linda. They were already barricaded inside their cabin.

“We heard it,” Ron told me, white-knuckled. “We’re not opening this door for anyone.”

Deputies arrived almost an hour later. They taped off the scene, muttered about “likely a break-in gone bad,” and combed the area. They found tracks leading toward the hills—heavy boots, long stride—but no suspect.

By morning, Ron and Linda wanted out. Deputies advised staying put until daylight, so they waited until the sun crept over the ridge. They were packing when they said they’d seen the man again—far off, watching.

I told them I’d escort them to the road, but before we even got to their truck, I spotted movement between the cabins just before dawn. A tall figure, rifle slung over his shoulder.

“Stop!” I yelled.

He bolted.

I reported the sighting, and deputies launched a bigger search. Desert, hills, arroyos—they swept everything. No luck.

Ron and Linda left anyway. Couldn’t blame them.

The owner called that afternoon. “Shut everything down. Go into town. Don’t take chances.”

But I stayed one more night, locking every door and window. Maybe stubbornness, maybe stupidity.

Around midnight, someone started pounding on my door.

“Open up!”

The voice was rough, unfamiliar.

I grabbed the landline—dead. The cord had been cut.

The pounding stopped.

Silence thick as the heat.

Then the window shattered. A forearm shoved through the glass, feeling for the lock.

I rammed a chair under the knob and sprinted for the back door. Hit the outside air running and jumped straight into the Jeep. Gravel shot out behind me as I tore down the dirt track toward the highway.

I didn’t look back until I hit the paved road. When I finally did, he was standing by my cabin, rifle hanging in one hand, watching my taillights fade.

I told the sheriff everything. A full manhunt kicked off—dogs, choppers, deputies from three counties. Reports started coming in from ranches and abandoned trailers: break-ins, stolen food, a shadowy figure drifting through the desert like a ghost with a gun.

After days of searching, they cornered him in the hills. Shots were exchanged. He fled again.

Eighteen days later, they finally caught him after another shootout.

His name was **Benjamin Peter Ashley**—a drifter with a long history of theft, violence, and living feral in the desert. He confessed to killing David for supplies and admitted he’d been watching the cabins for days, planning more.

I never went back.

I learned the desert isn’t empty. It listens. It watches. And sometimes, something out there watches back.





# ""Protecting Benny"":

I was between jobs last summer when my cousin called out of the blue, asking if I’d watch his cabin in the Kern County foothills for a weekend. He needed someone to check on things, and with his wife out of town, he asked if I could bring his six-year-old son, Benny, along.

“It’ll be fun,” he said. “Shoot some targets, fish in the pond. Benny loves it up there.”

I agreed. I figured a quiet weekend in the hills would be a nice reset. We took his old truck up the rough dirt road, bouncing over washouts and rocks until the cabin came into view—a simple log structure perched near a cliff edge, the desert sprawling out beneath it like an endless rust-colored ocean. No cell service. No neighbors. Just wind, pines, and open land.

Benny launched himself out of the truck before the engine even stopped. “Can we go to the pond?” he asked, tugging my sleeve with mustard-colored enthusiasm.

“Let me unpack the groceries first,” I said, unloading bread, juice boxes, and a handful of canned meals. After that, we walked down to the small man-made pond—a shallow circle of cold, still water surrounded by cattails and dust. We skipped stones. He celebrated each splash like he’d discovered fire. As the sun dipped, I cooked hot dogs over the old gas stove. He ate two, mustard smeared on both sides of his mouth like war paint.

That night, Benny went to sleep in the bunk room, and I took the couch. I read by lantern light until the cabin fell completely silent—no cars, no humming appliances, nothing but the occasional groan of cooling wood.

Then, just past midnight, I heard something outside.

A rustle. Footsteps on dry leaves.

I sat up, listening. Probably a raccoon, I told myself. Maybe a deer. I was about to lie back down when a sharp knock hit the door.

I froze.

Another knock—this one harder.

Not an animal.

I grabbed the flashlight and approached the door, keeping my voice steady. “Who’s there?”

No answer.

I cracked the curtain and shined the light through the window. A man stood on the porch, scruffy beard, green jacket streaked with desert dust, a hat pulled low. He raised his hand and knocked again, louder.

I opened the door a few inches, keeping the chain on. “Can I help you?”

He stared with wide, glassy eyes. “This place abandoned?” His voice was rough, strained.

“No,” I said carefully. “Private property. You should move along.”

He suddenly pushed the door, testing the chain.

“I been walking,” he said. “Need water.”

Something in his tone set off alarms. But refusing him seemed worse. I filled a bottle at the sink and passed it through the gap.

“Here. Take that and head out before morning.”

He took it, but didn’t leave. “Government’s after me,” he muttered, eyes darting around. “Dropped me from space in a bag. Hit the ground hard.”

A chill slid down my back.

I shut the door quickly and locked everything—deadbolt, chain, even the old wooden brace. Through the window, I watched him wander into the trees, swallowed by darkness.

I checked on Benny—still asleep, hugging his blanket—then lay on the couch with my heart hammering in my throat.

I didn’t sleep.

Just before dawn, another sound snapped me fully alert—a long, slow creak from the back porch.

I grabbed the fireplace poker.

“Benny,” I whispered through his door, “stay in your room.”

Before I could do anything else, the back door swung open.

He stepped in.

The same man.

Only this time, he held a sawed-off shotgun pointed directly at my chest.

“Don’t move,” he said, voice flat, dead behind the eyes. “Hands up.”

I lifted them slowly. “There’s a kid here. Just take what you want and leave.”

He scanned the cabin with erratic movements. “Where’s the boy?”

“In his room,” I said quickly. “He’s sleeping. Please don’t involve him.”

“Get him,” the man ordered. “We’re all going in there.”

I gently woke Benny. “Hey buddy… come with me.” He blinked up at me, confused, then terrified when he saw the man with the gun.

“Who is that?” he whispered.

“A man who needs help,” I lied. “Just stay calm.”

The intruder herded us into the small storage room beside the bunks and locked the door from the outside.

“Sit quiet,” he called through the wood. “I ain’t hurting kids.”

Benny clutched my shirt, trembling. “What’s he doing?” he whispered.

“I don’t know,” I said, holding him tight. “But we’re gonna be okay. Just stay quiet.”

For what felt like hours, we listened to him ransacking the place—drawers slamming, cans clattering, bags being filled. He muttered constantly, words blending into nonsense about police, desert survival, and conspiracies.

Then he yelled through the door: “Drink lots of water! It’s fifteen miles to the road!”

My stomach dropped—he didn’t plan on letting us out.

A few minutes later, the ATV engine roared to life—the only vehicle up there besides the truck. My cousin’s ATV.

The sound faded into the distance.

“Is he gone?” Benny whispered.

I tried the handle—still locked tight. We shoved our shoulders against the door, but it barely moved.

Then I remembered the tiny window.

“Okay, Benny,” I whispered. “I’m gonna boost you up. Crawl through and drop down outside. Then hide behind the trees. Don’t make noise.”

He nodded, scared but brave. I lifted him, and he squeezed through the window frame, disappearing from sight. I followed, scraping my arms raw.

We crouched behind rocks, breath shaking in our chests.

Then—an engine.

He was coming back.

The ATV headlights swept across the clearing. “Come out!” he shouted. “I see you!”

I grabbed Benny’s hand and moved us down a shallow creek bed, staying low. The rocks were sharp, the path slippery. At one point Benny tripped, skinning his knee, but I caught him before he cried out.

“Shh,” I breathed. “Just keep going.”

We climbed a steep hill, lungs burning, legs cramping. Behind us, the ATV circled like a predator searching for movement.

After what felt like an eternity, we reached a dirt road. I didn’t know which way to go—I just knew we couldn’t stay exposed.

Then a truck appeared, rattling up the road. It slowed when it saw us waving our arms.

It was my cousin’s friend, coming to check the place.

He took one look at our faces and didn’t need details. “Get in,” he said, already dialing police.

By the time authorities reached the cabin, the intruder was long gone. The place was emptied—bags packed, food stolen, drawers overturned. Later, they identified him as a drifter named Benjamin—a man suspected in another killing not far from there.

Benny and I were lucky. He never fired the gun. Never found us in the dark.

But even now, I still hear the sound of that shotgun’s click in my dreams.

And I haven’t stayed in a cabin—any cabin—since.





# ""The Breakup"":

I enrolled in that trigonometry class at Delta College in fall 2012 because I needed something—anything—to pull me out of the mess my life had become after separating from my husband. I’d been drowning in stress, raising my three boys mostly on my own, and trying not to fall apart. School seemed like a start. A routine. A reason to get out of the house.

That’s where I first noticed Shaun.

He sat a few rows ahead, always hunched over his notebook, scribbling formulas with this intense, focused expression. He rarely talked during class, but he laughed easily when someone cracked a joke. One afternoon, as we packed up our things, he lingered by the doorway and asked if I wanted to grab coffee and go over homework. His voice was soft, steady. He told me about his job working with machines, the hours, his dad, and he made me laugh—really laugh—for the first time in months.

We started dating quietly. By November, I had moved into his father’s old cabin out in the woods of Gladwin County. He said it would be peaceful. A fresh start. And, at the time, I believed him.

The place was small—a kitchen with a wood stove, a living room with faded plaid couches, two cramped bedrooms upstairs. The nearest neighbor was a quarter mile away, hidden by thick trees and quiet roads covered in dead leaves. Isolation felt like freedom back then.

In the beginning, Shaun was thoughtful. Gentle, even. He cooked simple dinners—pasta from cans, fried potatoes, soup—and we’d sit at the table and talk about my boys: Trever, Dennis, and Jesse. He always told me I deserved better than how my marriage had gone. He held my hand. He listened.

But the edges of him were sharp, and it didn’t take long for them to cut through.

He checked my phone without asking. He got irritated when I said I wanted to drive back to town for an afternoon. His moods twisted so fast it was like living with two different men—one who smiled and kissed my forehead, and another who stared through me like I wasn’t there.

The cabin, which had once felt quiet, started to feel claustrophobic. Too many shadows. Too many creaks. I missed my family more than I expected, and slowly I realized I didn’t want a “fresh start” with Shaun—I wanted to fix things with my husband. I wanted my life back.

So, on a cold, gray morning, I decided I was leaving.

Shaun had left early for work—or so he said. When his truck disappeared down the dirt road, I pulled my bags from under the bed and began folding my clothes, my hands shaking, adrenaline humming under my skin. I noticed the rifle by the door but looked away, trying to keep myself calm.

I wrote a short note and left it on the kitchen table:

*Shaun, this isn’t right for me anymore. I’m going back to my husband. Take care.*

I had barely set the pen down when I heard it—the rumble of his truck coming back up the drive far too soon.

The door creaked open. His boots thudded against the floor.

He saw the bags first. Then the note.

“What’s this?” he asked, his voice flat but cold. His fingers crushed the paper, and his eyes narrowed into something I’d never seen in a person before.

“Shaun,” I said as evenly as I could, “I need to go home. I want to make things work for my kids.”

He didn’t argue. He didn’t shout.

He just moved—quick, deliberate—and reached for the rifle.

The first shot exploded through the cabin, through my skull, through my entire world. Pain and heat burst across my head, and blood spilled past my eye. I collapsed but stayed conscious, the room spinning in disorienting, nauseating waves.

He fired again. The second bullet grazed my side, ripping a line of fire through my ribs.

I went limp, letting my breath go shallow, pretending I was gone.

He stood over me, panting, muttering, “Why did you make me do this… why did you make me…”

He didn’t call 911. He didn’t run.

Instead, he grabbed me by the arms and dragged me up the stairs—my body bumping against every wooden step. In the small bedroom, he tied my wrists and ankles with coarse rope from the closet, jerking the knots tight until they bit into my skin.

“You’re not leaving me,” he said, sitting on the bed, staring at me with a strange, dreamy calm. “You belong here.”

The window was nailed shut. The walls were thick logs. No one would hear me even if I screamed. And I was losing blood. I knew it.

The following days blurred into a nightmare I survived minute by minute.

He brought water but barely any food—just cold soup or dry bread shoved against my lips. My head pounded nonstop, the wound swelling, vision doubling when I tried to focus. He paced the floor constantly, muttering to himself, sometimes to me.

One night, the lamplight flickering low, he sat beside me and said, almost casually, “I had to do something like this before, with my fiancée. She tried to walk out too. I stopped her.”

Cold terror crawled through me. My voice was barely a whisper. “Shaun… my boys need me. Please.”

“No one’s waiting,” he said. “I texted your husband from your phone. Told him you needed space.”

He took me outside once—said he needed air. He drove to a frozen lake not far from the cabin. The moment we reached the shore, he shoved my head under the icy water. My lungs screamed. Blackness crept from the edges of my vision. Just before I lost consciousness, he yanked me back up.

“That’s how easy it ends,” he whispered.

Back at the cabin, he tied me even tighter.

But on the fourth day, something changed. His mood softened—like nothing had happened. He brought a bowl of oatmeal and sat in the chair, watching me.

“I don’t want you starving,” he said.

When he left to shower, I heard the pipes groan as the water kicked on. I knew I had one chance.

Hands shaking, I peeled back the tape around my ankles, working the rope loose millimeter by millimeter. Every sound from upstairs made my heart slam against my ribs. When I finally slipped one foot free, then the other, I stood—barefoot, dizzy, lightheaded—but I stood.

I crept down the stairs, remembering exactly which boards creaked. The back door was unlocked.

I pushed it open and ran.

Cold dirt and twigs tore into my feet, branches whipped my arms, but I didn’t stop. The night air stung my wounds, but adrenaline drowned the pain. I ran toward the faintest glow of a porch light a quarter mile away.

By the time I reached the neighbor’s garage, I was trembling and half delirious. I hid under a tarp until the sound of his truck roared past, searching.

When it finally faded, I crawled out and banged on the garage door. Two men opened it and froze when they saw me—bloody, soaking, barely able to speak.

“Help me,” I gasped. “He shot me… he kept me tied up… please.”

They wrapped me in a blanket and called 911.

Police found Shaun at the cabin that night. He didn’t fight. He didn’t deny anything.

At the hospital, they treated the gunshot wounds—a cracked skull, shrapnel that required surgeries, deep bruising, rope burns. But the worst injuries were the ones nightmares kept reopening for years.

Shaun went to prison for a long time.

But those four days in that cabin never really left me. I walked out alive—but I carried the echo of each moment with me, a reminder of how close I came to disappearing in those woods forever.





# ""Taken"":

I agreed to watch my aunt and uncle’s cabin in the Wisconsin woods because it sounded like the easiest thing a thirteen-year-old could possibly be trusted with. Feed the dog, keep the fire going, lock the doors at night—simple. They lived deep in the forest, their cabin tucked so far back that the dirt road looked more like a forgotten logging path than any sort of driveway. No neighbors. No cell service unless the weather cooperated. My parents thought the quiet would teach me responsibility. I thought the quiet would be…well, quiet.

They left on a Sunday afternoon, waving from the car as it bumped away between the trees. I stood on the porch with the dog, Duke, who nudged my hand like he already sensed the place was too big and too silent without more humans around.

The first day drifted by without anything strange. I made a grilled cheese for lunch, read on the couch, and walked Duke along the looping trail behind the cabin—a path my uncle cut years ago that now felt more like a tunnel carved through the pines. The cabin’s interior glowed warm and honey-colored from the old wood, and the big window facing the trees made everything seem peaceful and safe. I called my mom that night.

“You’re doing great,” she said. “Just remember—lock the doors.”

I rolled my eyes, smiling. “I know, Mom.”

That night, I locked everything. Duke curled up at the foot of my bed, his breathing steady. Sometime after midnight, I woke to a sound—something sharp, like a heavy branch snapping clean in half. My eyes opened instantly. Duke’s head lifted. The woods outside seemed to be holding their breath. Nothing else came. I whispered, “Probably a deer,” more to myself than to him, and eventually drifted back to sleep.

But the next morning, I stepped outside and froze.

Footprints.

Human ones. Large ones. Boots. Not my uncle’s—they had gone north for the whole week, hours away. The prints came from the trees, stopped near the driveway, and then vanished in the direction of the woods again. My stomach tightened. Duke sniffed at them, whining low in his throat.

I told myself it was a hunter. Or a hiker. Or anyone who had every right to be in the woods. I didn’t want to think about what else it could be. So I distracted myself all day—cleaning the kitchen, blasting music from my phone, making Duke chase a stick in the yard. By afternoon, I almost convinced myself it didn’t matter.

Then the landline rang.

The shrill sound echoed through the cabin like it was slicing the quiet in half. I picked it up.

“Hello?”

Nothing. Just breathing. Slow. Intentional.

My hand tightened on the receiver. “Hello?”

Still nothing.

I hung up. The silence afterward felt heavier than before.

By evening, my nerves were stretched thin. I double-checked every lock twice. Drew the curtains. Kept the fire going because the glow made the place feel less like a cave. Duke wouldn’t sit still—he paced the front door over and over.

Around ten, scratching came from the back door. Not frantic. Slow. Deliberate. The sound of something—someone—testing the wood.

Duke growled, a deep warning sound I’d never heard from him before.

I crept toward the door and peered through the tiny window. Only darkness. I whispered, “Who’s there?” even though that’s the sort of sentence people say right before they die in movies. The scratching stopped instantly, like whatever was doing it had been waiting for my voice.

I backed away. Hands shaking, I tried calling my aunt’s cell. No answer. Just voicemail. Bad reception, I told myself. They’re out of range.

That night, sleep wouldn’t come. I lay stiff under the covers, listening to every creak of the cabin. Every groan of the trees outside. Every shift of Duke’s body at the foot of the bed. When I finally drifted into an uneasy dream, a thunderous knock snapped me upright.

Someone at the front door.

Duke exploded into barking, teeth bared, his whole body rigid.

Another knock—harder, furious.

I grabbed my phone. No signal.

“Who is it?” I called, my voice trembling.

No answer—then a third knock, so forceful dust drifted from the doorframe.

I crept to the living room, legs shaking. Through the peephole, a man stood on the porch. A dark coat. A mask. Winter gloves. And something long and metallic in his hands.

A gun.

“Open the door!” he shouted.

I stumbled backward. “Go away! I’m calling the police!”

His reply was a deafening blast. The lock shattered. The door swung open, slamming against the wall. Duke lunged, barking and snapping, but the man kicked him so hard he flew into the coffee table.

I ducked behind the kitchen counter as the man stomped inside, shotgun raised.

“Where are you?” His voice was gravel.

He stormed through the cabin, flipping lights on, checking rooms with violent, impatient movements. When he reached the kitchen, I tried to run, but he saw me instantly.

“There you are,” he said softly, as if greeting an old friend.

He grabbed my arm so hard my vision blurred. Duct tape wrapped around my wrists, my ankles, cutting into my skin. I screamed for Duke, but he was lying still, whimpering.

“Stop fighting,” the man growled. “You’re coming with me.”

He dragged me outside into the freezing night and shoved me into his trunk. It slammed shut. Darkness swallowed me.

The drive felt endless. No sense of direction. No sense of time. Just bumps, turns, the muffled sound of my own breathing and the clattering of tools somewhere beside me.

When the trunk finally opened, he pulled me out. Another cabin—smaller, older, more isolated. Inside, the air smelled of dust and stale sweat. One bedroom. One couch. No windows that opened. No phone.

“This is your new home,” he said, as if it were a kindness.

His name, he claimed, was Jake. I didn’t believe him. He made rules—don’t talk unless spoken to, eat when told, sit where told. When he left for work, he shoved me under his bed and stacked heavy boxes along the sides so I couldn’t crawl out. Hours in the dark. No way to stretch. My legs went numb. My thoughts grew louder.

When he was home, he acted like we were roommates. He’d cook simple meals and sit across from me, studying me the way someone studies a puzzle they want to take apart.

“I saw you once,” he said while stirring a pot of pasta. “Knew you were the one. I followed you for months.”

I stared at the wall and tried not to breathe.

“You’ll get used to it,” he added, smiling like he believed it.

But I never did. I planned. I waited. I watched.

Christmas came. He left me under the bed the entire day, radio blaring to hide any noise I made. I cried until I couldn’t make sound anymore.

Weeks blurred. Time lost meaning. He grew comfortable, careless.

And one January afternoon, he made his mistake.

“I’ll be back in a few hours,” he said. “You know the rules.”

He shoved me under the bed once more, blocked me in, and locked the door behind him. But this time, the boxes didn’t feel as heavy. Or maybe I’d gotten stronger. Desperate strength. I pushed. Hard. Sweat dripped into my eyes. Something shifted—a bin slid an inch. Then another. My wrists screamed from the old tape marks, but I forced myself through the narrow gap, scraping my skin raw.

The cabin was silent.

I grabbed the nearest pair of shoes—his enormous sneakers—and ran outside. The cold hit me like a slap. I didn’t know where I was, but I knew I had to move. Branches tore at my face as I sprinted through the trees, lungs burning, legs trembling from weeks of confinement.

Then I saw her—a woman walking her dog along a narrow rural road. She froze when she saw me.

“Help,” I gasped. “He took me…please…”

Her face drained of color. “Oh my god. You’re the missing girl.” She threw her coat around me and shouted to the nearest house. “Call the police!”

I barely remember sitting on the stranger’s couch, shaking uncontrollably. “He has a red car,” I whispered. “He lives close.”

Police arrived fast. Lights flashing through the windows. Gentle voices asking gentle questions. I could hardly answer. And then one officer’s radio crackled—someone spotted the car.

Minutes later, they found him. He stepped out calmly, hands raised.

“I did it,” he said, like it was nothing.

They took me to the hospital. My aunt arrived the next morning, collapsing around me in tears.

“We thought we lost you,” she whispered over and over.

I stayed with family, trying to piece myself back into a person. Trying to sleep without hearing that knock. That scratching. That voice saying, “There you are.”

Jake—whatever his real name was—got life without parole. But the nightmares didn’t stop just because he couldn’t leave prison.

I talk now—to counselors, to kids, to anyone who needs to understand that monsters don’t always hide under beds. Sometimes they hide above them, pacing, waiting, believing you’ll never find the strength to push your way out.

But I did.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I was back home recently and ran into my ex-situationship at a coffee shop. We only talked briefly, but she shared that she was diagnosed with BPD and has been sober for a while now. The difference in her was honestly night and day.

I’ve been reading through this thread and it seems like a lot of people believe folks with BPD don’t really change… but wow. I was genuinely impressed by the growth I saw. She was attractive before, and I’ll admit I used to be a bit obsessed, but now I’m almost intrigued to reconnect. She seemed softer, calmer, and there was a light in her eyes that wasn’t there before and none of that heaviness or darkness she used to carry.

Has anyone here had a positive experience with someone who used to be pretty messy or hurtful, but later did the work and became a much healthier, gentler version of themselves? I’m trying to understand whether what I saw was real change or just temporary because I genuinely would love to reach out to her!

I'm recovering from being sick so I'm just enjoying a slow day and trying to get through some household chores. I'm looking for normal/sfw chats. I'm open to calling on Discord if we get along, since it's easier to chit-chat.

I'm currently a graduate student so that keeps me pretty busy. Whenever I do have some free time, I enjoy painting, hiking, spending time outdoors, writing, cooking a little, and going on day trips. Also love going to a coffee shop and reading/chillin.

Feel free to message me if you think we'll get along, and please do include your age and some stuff about yourself.

""*You’ve stumbled upon the Spirit Ash remains of the Avalāriem Knight; Idim. A Knight from a forgotten realm, existing within its own Atmospheric Bubble in the depths of the Cosmic Ocean that we find ourselves floating so carelessly in. While its original owner is no longer around to share its story, there were scattered pages of a diary belonging to a ‘Hand of Avalār’ who would have called on the Ashes aid. What’s the harm in reading what someone else had left behind? Perhaps it could shed some light on who these people were.""*

I am RL713 that can switch between *aggressive* and *supportive* combat. Utilizing *Erdtree Heal*, *Warming Stones*, *Minor Erdtree*, *Uplifting Aromatics*, and a *Crimsonburst Dried Tear*; I can keep both the Host of Fingers and myself alive to the best of both of our abilities. Combining this with *Starlight Shards* and *Lulling Branches*, I ensure that I will stay in the Host’s world for as long as they may need me.

I also do much more than just helping people with Bosses. I heavily enjoy exploring the Open World and Dungeons, seeing things I haven’t before. I’ve played this game a lot and I often find myself going the same routes as I always do, helping people out gives me a chance to see more of this game that I normally would have missed. I also help improvement with *PvP* and *PvE*, however I do not claim to be good at any of these things. My primary goal is to be an immersive and fun experience in a game where *everything* wants to kill you.

# Exploration

I will often stick to the Host, as an NPC would, following and assisting in any combat. When I am accompanying new Tarnished, I will often *alert* my Host by calling out to them. An environmentally aware Host can then follow me to various *Key Items* such as *Golden Seeds*, *Perfume Bottles*, *Scadu Fragments*, and many more. The Host can also inform me of anything they are looking for and I can lead them to it once we are in the area. The DLC is my second home, I spend more time vibing there more than anything, sticking mainly to Rauh and  Belurat/Enir-Ilim. Thanks to this, **I have every** ***Scadu Fragment*** **in the DLC marked on my map**.

# Improvement at Player vs Player?

I can spar with you for as long as you need, I even have an Un-Upgraded Loadout so there is less risk of you dying during live exercises. If you want to get better in certain aspects, I can do that as well. Need to get better against *Invaders*? Summon me as an *Adversary* for various types of *Invaders* you’d run across, in a *Non-Toxic Environment*. Want to get better at being an *Invader*? I can summon you as an *Adversary* and you can get a feel for what’s right for you.

# Improvement at Player vs Environment?

I have a **RL713** character with **+0 Equipment** that I’ve almost beaten the *Base Game* and *DLC* on. Here you can *Explore*, *Fight Roaming Bosses*, or *Vibe with Me*. As a *Cooperator*, you won’t have to worry about losing your *Runes* or *Invaders*, since the RL and Upgrades are so different. Have a friend who wants to get better or just be an *Adversary*? That’s fine too, the more the merrier. ***Toxic Players Will Be Blocked***.

# Communication?

Direct Messages are perfectly ok with me, however I do not do VoIP. Much like most of the Ashes in-game, I don’t typically speak. This is because I’m typically in a party or otherwise unable to use my headset, however I will *rarely* make an exception.  
*^(I will not accept random Friend Requests on)* ***^(any)*** *^(platform.)*

# What The Hell Is A “Hand of Avalār”?

A *Hand of Avalār* is the Orders take on an *Avalāriem Oracle*; An Avalāriem who’s incapable of combat on their own, only having a strong connection to Spiritual Arts, they stay out of harm's way and rely on their comrades. Even if that comrade has fallen in battle, a Hand of Avalār can call their spirit back to *dawn their equipment again* and finish what was started.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p2q6vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyWitch/comments/1p2q6vc/i_did_my_first_blood_spell/,i did my first blood spell,"I'm going to be honest, this post may have a lot of typos because it's midnight and English is not my first language. I ask that you please be gentle and open-minded. I'm not going to lie, but when I first heard of blood magic, it seemed like an incredibly powerful, scary, and even taboo thing to do, and a lot of the spells I saw that used magic were baneful or vengeful in nature, so I always saw it as something that was...overkill and even harmful, until I tried it tonight.

I'm bearing my heart to the public when I say I've been going through a really tough time. it put me in a dark headspace and even worse emotional and physical state where I couldn't even get out of bed, and I could barely eat or shower. My confidence was in the gutter, my peace rattled, my sleep disturbed, and most of all, I was drowning in self-loathing and pain, wondering endlessly about everything I ever did wrong, every failure, every loss. I almost even stopped my witchcraft practices and reverted back to some of my old self-destructive and unhealthy coping mechanisms. I already almost lost myself to my own hands years ago because of this depression. I don't know what willed me to do this so suddenly, maybe desperation? hope? All I know is that I got up and went outside at 10pm at night, collected things I felt I needed and wanted, and sat down and did the most complex spell I've done yet with barely any instructions or references, it was almost instinctual, I dare say

So i grabbed

a hibiscus flower, for beauty, vitality, and for how it blooms widely to welcome warmth and light

a couple leaves from my starfruit tree my late father planted, the fruit that many times gave me nourishment when I could not afford food, for health, nourishment, and sweetness

stems from a ghost plant succulent for its resilience and strength in the face of dark and rough weather

(the rest i already had at the house)

salt for protection and cleansing

cloves for control and power

cinnamon for self-love and prosperity

rosemary for wisdom and clarity

Coffee grounds, for energy and motivation

a sigil I created for hope, energy, and positivity. I burned the edges to activate and seal it.

It sounds like a lot, right? This is where it might get controversial or even triggering, so be warned if your sensitive to topics of SH or depression. I have never used so much or put so much prep into a spell, but I was determined as if it was my last thread of hope. I whispered to every herb my wishes, my wants, and my worries and put it all into, believe it or not, an empty bottle of my antidepressants. Ironically, it was the only container I had on hand, and honestly? It just seemed appropriate for this moment. And of course I cannot forget the last ingredient, blood. The way I saw it in this moment was not as one of pain or suffering, but rather as an act of self preservation. Instead of harming myself because of my self-hatred, I did it as an act of self-service in a sense. I wasn't spilling blood but rather infusing my hopes and wants with my life force itself. Sure, it felt a bit weird, and I was a bit apprehensive, but it just felt so right in the moment. It hurt, obviously, but nothing compared to all the self-doubt, pain, and grief I had been holding inside and dragging along with me. Once the spell was put together, I sealed it with pink candle wax. Why pink? because it's my favorite color and it makes me feel happy and cozy.

In the end, I was left with something so highly personalized, so me, and even though I still felt the weight of the world on my shoulders, I couldn't help but feel...relaxed? lighter? and not in the sense that the weight was taken off because no, my problems are still very much present and will not disappear soon or on their own, but somehow I felt okay with that. It was not this dreadful, overwhelming, and all consuming anxiety but rather, acceptance. To be honest again, I rarely ever know what the hell I'm doing, even now, but I still wanted to share my experience so maybe I won't feel so out of place for once, maybe because I would like to hear someone relates or shared the same views and fears. that I once saw blood as something to be feared, associated with pain, sickness, injury, and even death because of my own experiences and biases. But I realized it's all about the intent and meaning YOU give it for your own work. Because while it can mean all of those things, it can also mean life, birth, growth, energy, and connection because that is the one thing that drives all of us on a day-to-day basis. It's dual-natured, and to finish things off.

Do I think my spell will work? Hell if I know! Haha, I'm just a baby witch who's trying to figure things out. But either way it goes, I'm happy for the moment of tranquility and focus it brought, no matter how momentary it may be. I also know that in order for the spell to help you, YOU HAVE TO HELP YOURSELF TOO. Herbs and rituals wont put in all the work for you, you gotta meet them halfway by not doing things to jeopardize or sabotage yourself. Will everyone agree with this post or my methods? Nope! And that's also okay, because the longer I'm in this community, the longer I realize there is no one singular way to do things. It's okay to experiment; it's okay to feel okay with one thing and not okay with another. Witchcraft is HIGHLY individual to each one's journey and beliefs and can be so intuitive with time and patience.

Anyways, sorry for the long post, but I wanted to add as many details as I could of my experience because I like sharing these things, it helps me realize and remember we're all just trying to find a place we feel comfortable and safe in.

We have two nannies, and I’m feeling guilty about cutting the hours of one of them, but I’m also questioning whether she’s the right fit for our family anymore.

When this nanny arrives, she usually takes our toddler out to a playgroup or coffee shop. He likes getting out of the house, and that part is great, but this seems to be her strongest area. At home, she’s not very playful, silly, or warm with him. She often arrives tired and tends to talk a lot about negative things happening in her personal life.

If we’re around while she’s here, our toddler clings to me and doesn’t want to be put down. He’ll go with her when it’s time to leave, but if we come out of the office later in the day, he often cries and reaches for us right away. I also don’t see her reading to him or playing with toys in an engaged way. He doesn’t show much excitement when she arrives. She’s also consistently a few minutes late.

We’re not necessarily trying to fire her, but compared to our other nanny- who is very playful, silly, and actively teaches him things- the difference is noticeable. The other nanny just doesn’t take him out as much.

Is it reasonable to keep the first nanny for just one day a week for the outings, or is that likely to be confusing or unhelpful for our toddler? How do others handle situations where one caregiver is “fine” but clearly not the right long-term fit?

Is it considered rude to pay for a small purchase at a bakery, store, etc... with a large bill early in the day?  For example, buying a coffee or snack at 5:30 and paying with 50€.

I worked retail in the US for a while, and it was always annoying when the first transaction of the day was something less than $2 and someone paid with a $20 or $50.  It completely wiped out my register and/or I had to pay them or the next person back in small change, then the managers got annoyed about having to come back to refill it so soon, often taking it out on the employee etc....  I worked briefly at a fast food place when I first came to Germany, and it happened there too sometimes, and the managers also got irritated.  Obviously later in the day is less of a problem, when the Kasse has more money/larger bills in it.

So I always have small money with me if I have to buy something early in the morning, Our ""argument,"" relates to when I buy a coffee at our small Bahnhof bakery at 5:30 a.m, on days where I have to travel for work.  I will occasionally ask if he has 5€ if I don't have anything small.  He keeps telling me that here in Germany no one cares, and it's perfectly acceptable to pay that way, regardless of the time of day, or size of purchase.  He thinks it's ridiculous to be concerned about it, but I'm still of the opinion that it's inconsiderate.

So, dumb question - but is this really a thing here?",27,1763701449.0,germany,45,0.86,False

— Morning

Another one hundred degree day in Brimstone Creek. The air feels like a wool blanket, thick with red dust and the scent of baked sagebrush. It is not quite six in the morning, but the heat coming off the ground is enough to warp the planks on the porch of the Mercantile.

I woke at sunrise, as always, but did not open up until seven. The bell above the door has been ringing all day long, mostly for things I cannot sell much of, like small cans of peaches or an extra bolt for a rifle. Mr. Henderson, the blacksmith, was first to borrow a few pennies. He promises to repay me on Tuesday. I doubt he will.

— Half past noon 

A man I did not recognize, riding a fine black mare came in not 10 minutes ago. He bought four whole sacks of oats and paid in silver dollars, a sound that has become rare around here. He was not talkative, just a quick shake of the hand and a warning to “keep warm”. He did not look worried, just tired. I thought nothing of it. Men on the trail are often tired. He rode off in haste. I wondered if he’s a Bad Man you read about in the Press.

— Evening

I finished tallying the register by five thirty. The day was a wash, but the profit from the horse dealer put me in the black for the week. I locked the massive oak door of Vance's Mercantile and started the short walk back to the small room behind the store, where I sleep.

The town is quiet. Too quiet for a Saturday night, though the heat keeps most folk inside. Tonight, though, there is a distinct coolness that I have not felt in three weeks. It is not relief; it is a sharpness in the air, the kind that hints at a high altitude storm, but it is moving too fast. The scent of ozone is thick.

I looked up. The sky is dark, but not with clouds. It is a deep, bruised purple that swallows the stars. It feels less like weather and more like the shadow of a mountain that is not there.

— Half past seven 

I went inside and closed the door. It is probably just a dust storm coming in early. I will wake up tomorrow and everything will be buried in fine red powder, and I will spend the morning sweeping.

I hope I do not dream of Martha or Clara tonight. Sleep is the only place they live anymore.





August 5th, 1888

— Six in the Morning

The quiet was the first thing that bothered me. There were no crickets, no birdsong, just stillness. When I went outside, the porch was slick with moisture, and the air bit at my cheeks. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but there was a thin sheet of white frost coating the porch railing and the dried sagebrush outside. August. Frost. It made no sense. I checked the thermometer I keep nailed to the wall. It read 31 degrees Fahrenheit. An hour before dawn. It should be 75.

— Half past seven 

The stove was stoked quickly. I got the Mercantile open. The sun was up and doing its work. By the time old Mr. Hemmings rode in for his coffee beans, the frost had melted to mud and steam. The ground hissed.

— Ten in the morning 

Business was steady. A few prospectors needed to resupply before heading back into the higher ground. Agnes Thorne was in, looking for a new tin of baking powder. She spent twenty minutes complaining that the last batch made her biscuits flat. I told her flat biscuits were not a matter of my powder, but perhaps the way she was rolling them. She gave me a look that could curdle milk and left without buying anything. That was the humor for the day, I suppose.

— Afternoon

Dr. Finch came in looking for whiskey, which he claims is for ""medicinal poultices."" We both know it is for his nerves. He bought two quarts and asked me about the frost. I told him what the thermometer said. He muttered something about a cold air vortex, but he looked worried. He is too smart to accept a simple answer. He has seen enough death to know when nature is out of balance.

— Sunset

I locked up right at closing. The sun is still high, but the light has a strange, yellow cast. The heat that defined yesterday is gone. The temperature is maybe fifty degrees, which is a glorious early fall day, not August. The wind is starting to pick up, and it is carrying a sound with it, a thin, high whistle. It sounds like air moving through a very tight keyhole.

I walked the ten paces to my back room and looked at the sky one last time. That deep purple from yesterday is bigger now. It is swallowing the horizon. It looks like a massive bruise on the face of the world.
I have a bad feeling. Not the hollow dread I usually carry, but a new, sharp, and cold fear.


August 6th, 1888

— Right after dawn

It is a miracle I slept at all. The cold was overwhelming, even with three blankets piled on. I went to light the stove. When I looked out the back window, the world was white.

Not a light dusting. It was snowing so hard it made the air look thick. Big, wet flakes falling straight down, stacking up fast. It looked like the dead of winter, yet the calendar says early August.
The frost from yesterday was just a warning. This is a complete betrayal of the season.

— Eight in the morning

I opened the Mercantile, though I expected no one. The bell rang almost immediately. It was Agnes Thorne, bundled in a heavy shawl and holding a basket. She was furious. Not scared, but furious at the inconvenience.

""Silas Vance,"" she hissed, stamping snow off her boots. ""What is the meaning of this foolishness? This is the Lord punishing us for the gambling at the saloon. You need to put a stop to it.""

I told her I only sell goods, not sermons or miracles. I sold her a bag of rock salt for her steps and she hurried out, muttering about Sodom and Gomorrah.

— Before noon

The town is in disorder. The snow is already eight inches deep and still coming down without wind. It is an unnaturally heavy fall. People are coming in just to talk, not to buy. They stand by the stove and speculate.

The theories: A new comet has hit the atmosphere. God has moved the town north. The Indians have put a curse on the valley.

I tried to keep everyone calm. I sold Dr. Finch another quart of ""poultice"" whiskey. He was talking about atmospheric pressure systems collapsing. Even his science sounds like superstition today. It is unsettling how quickly people lose their footing when the rules of the sky are broken.

— Early evening

I locked the door exactly on time. The snow is now past my knees. The sound it makes is strange. It does not crunch. It makes a high, dull sizzle when you step on it, like pouring water onto a hot griddle. It is exhausting just to walk ten feet.

The entire valley is buried in silence. The air is cold enough to freeze water instantly, maybe 15 degrees. I cannot see the mountains anymore. Everything is just solid, blinding white.

I am not afraid of the cold. I am afraid that the sun never showed up today. Even at noon, it felt like twilight. The purple shadow is now everywhere. It has absorbed the sky.
I am safe in my little room behind the store. Tomorrow, this madness will be over. It has to be.









August 7th, 1888

— Just before ten in the morning

It took me nearly an hour to clear the door. The snow is ten feet high against the north side of the Mercantile. It is solid, like packed sand, not flakes. I was sweating and shaking by the time I managed to open the door, just enough to slip inside. My thick fur from up north keeping the icy air from sticking to my body made it all the more difficult to move through the door. 

I stoked the potbelly stove until the iron was red. I only have enough wood for maybe three more days if we are cautious. I was sorting through my supply of coal oil when the bell finally jingled.

It was Lillian Hart, holding her son Caleb. She looked half frozen and completely desperate.

""Silas, please,"" she choked out. ""The house is dead cold. The chimney blew out, or maybe it just stopped drawing. Caleb is feverish.""

The boy, Caleb, looked pale. His eyes were wide and red, but he was silent. He did not look feverish to me. He looked terrified. I pointed them to the small wooden bench near the stove.

— Ten in the morning

I gave Lillian a tin of beef broth and a blanket. Before she could settle, the bell rang again. Dr. Finch, looking worse for wear and carrying his small black bag.
He did not even greet me. He went straight to the stove, warming his hands. He then saw the boy, Caleb, and his pragmatism kicked in. He kneeled down, checking the child's pulse and forehead.

While the Doctor was working, Jed Moss, the town drunkard, stumbled into the store, bottle of amber liquor in hand. He was laughing, a horrible, wet sound.

""Silas, you genius,"" Jed slurred, kicking snow off his boots. ""The saloon is frozen solid. Even the whiskey is turning to slush. You are the only warm tomb left.""

I ignored him and started gathering the items Dr. Finch had asked for: camphor, a bottle of laudanum, and a thermometer.

— Half past ten in the morning

The bell sounded one last time, violently. Agnes Thorne burst in, pulling her shawl tight. She took one look at Jed Moss, red faced and reeking of cheap liquor, and her jaw locked.

""You cannot tell me this is not God's judgment!"" Agnes boomed, pointing a trembling finger at Jed. ""The harlots, the gambling, and this drunkard, they brought this white doom upon us!""

Jed, shivering and desperate for another drink, sneered back. ""Doom? This is just weather, old woman! A flash freeze! You want to preach? Go do it on a frozen stump in the street!""

""It is not weather!"" Agnes shrieked, her voice thin with righteous fury. ""When has August ever known such cold? This is a sign! A direct sign of what you sinners are dragging the rest of us into! I should have brought my Bible and burned your wicked things.""

""The only thing wicked here is your face!"" Jed yelled. ""You want judgment? You look like judgment, you old crow!""

Dr. Finch, who had been studying the thermometer with a strained intensity, slammed his hand down on the counter.
""Stop it! Both of you!"" the Doctor snapped, his voice trembling. ""This is not theological! This is a rapid thermodynamic collapse! We are experiencing an atmospheric phenomenon so aggressive that the temperature delta is causing—""

Agnes cut him off, pointing to the ceiling. ""Thermodynamics? This is the wrath of the Almighty! I knew you were an atheist, Finch! Trying to give science to the end of the world!""

""I am giving you facts, woman!"" Finch retorted, his face pale with frustrated terror. ""The thermal energy in the valley is being vacuumed out! This is unnatural! There is a void of heat outside!""

""Void of heat, void of grace! It is the same thing!"" Agnes cried, taking a step toward Jed. ""You are not fit to breathe the same air as the child, you pagan beast!""

Jed stopped shivering long enough to unleash a single, cutting word that silenced the room. ""You rotten, dried up harridan!""
Lillian pulled Caleb tighter, shielding him from the escalating row.

That is when the air changed.

It was not a wind, but a pressure. A 
sickening, massive sound hit the Mercantile. It sounded like a mountain falling over and scraping the entire valley floor on its way down. We heard trees splintering outside, and then the terrified screams of horses and cattle, the sounds cut abruptly short, as if someone had snuffed them out like candles.
The entire building shook.

The light quickly dimmed. It was suddenly pure white darkness beyond the windows and doors, thicker than any snow fall I had seen.

The wind screamed and pounded against the front door, like a wailing animal. Trying its damndest to reach the warmth beyond the wooden entrance. 

But storms don’t scream for help and beg to be let in.

Dr. Finch went white. ""Ruth! That is Ruth!""

Dr. Finch raced to the oak door, grabbing the iron handle and pulling with all the strength of a panicked man. The door did not budge. It was solid. He grabbed the heavy brass counterweight from the scale, a weight of maybe twenty pounds, and slammed it against the thick wood. The door only gave off a dull, dead sound, like striking stone. It was sealed.

Finch dropped the weight and pressed his face to the wood. I saw a thin, slick layer of new ice forming on the inside where the wood met the frame. Through a clear patch of that crystalline layer, he saw a horrible, distorted shape pressed against the outside of the door.

It was Ruth. Her face was contorted in a final, soundless scream, trapped inches away.

""Ruth! Don't just stand there!"" Dr. Finch began to scream, pounding the door with his fists. ""The heat! You need to move! Kick it! Break the ice, for gods sake, break the ice!”.

Ruth’s eyes met his through the magnifying ice, wide with shock and a paralyzing cold. She could not move. She made a faint, soundless motion with her hand.

""No! No, Ruth, look at me!"" Finch pleaded, tears instantly freezing on his cheeks. ""It's growing! Move your hand! Please, sweetheart, don't let the cold take you like this! I’m sorry, I’m so, so sorry, my sweetheart I —""

Even as he watched, a thin, white frost began to crawl up the edges of her shawl and across her exposed skin. The cold was consuming her instantly, right there, inches from her husband.

Finch let out a sound of absolute, defeated despair. It was not a cry; it was a raw, animal noise of final recognition. He slid to the floor, staring at the patch of ice that had just become his wife's frozen tomb.

We are sealed in. The Doctor is broken.

I tried the windows. The glass did not break. It did not even rattle. It just held, showing only the blinding, uniform, impossible white of the storm.

We are six people now, trapped inside Vance's Mercantile. The world outside is gone.

— Early afternoon

The silence is the worst part. It has been two hours since that massive crash outside. Now, nothing. No wind. No horses. No sound of the town at all. If I press my ear against the oak door, I can hear a high, faint hiss, like a poorly sealed kettle, but that is all.

The debate is loud. Agnes is convinced it is the Devil’s doing and is trying to pray over Jed, who is now terrified and crying for more whiskey. Jed thinks the world has flipped over and that they are stuck on the bottom.
Dr. Finch is the most unnerving. He is pacing, staring at the windows, and rubbing his chin. He keeps trying to offer scientific terms, talking about rapid cooling and thermodynamic principles, but he looks like a man reciting Latin in a foreign land. He knows his science is failing him.

Lillian is huddled with Caleb. The boy is no better. His skin is too cold, despite the stove glowing cherry red less than six feet away. The Doctor checked him again.

— Mid afternoon

We ate canned peaches. The silence makes every movement loud. The scraping of the spoons, the clinking of the cans. Agnes is staring at Caleb, and I do not like the look in her eyes. She sees the boy as weak, a liability.

I found myself back at the counter, automatically reaching for the small, leather-bound ledger I use for inventory. It is my journal, too. I carry it everywhere. I looked at the first page—a neatly scribbled entry about the price of sugar and a brief, happy note about Clara learning to spell her name. This book used to be filled with boring store scribbles and the rare, treasured happy memory. 

Now, in just a few days, it is full only of dire happenings and hopeless thoughts. After Martha and Clara died, writing things down became the only way I could prove the world was still ordered. It was the only thing I could think to do now: If the world was ending, I would at least record the final inventory.

The stove is not performing correctly. It is hot enough to burn the skin off your hands, yet the air ten feet away is like an icebox. It is not a gradient of heat; it is an invisible wall. I tried moving the bench closer to the stove, but when Lillian stood up, she suddenly swayed.

Dr. Finch caught her. ""What is it, Lillian?""
""The floor,"" she whispered. ""It felt like the floor tilted under me.""

We all stopped. We tested it. The wooden floor of the Mercantile is level. But when you walk past a certain point, about fifteen feet from the stove, you feel a distinct sense of wrongness. Like you are suddenly standing on a small ship rocking gently in the waves. Only one person feels it at a time. It is brief, maybe a second.

— Late afternoon

We are running low on lamp oil. I cannot sleep in my back room tonight; the door is too flimsy. We are all staying in the main store room. I am rationing the wood.

Caleb is still very sick. Dr. Finch took his temperature again, and he looked at the thermometer with a blank stare.

""Silas,"" he finally said, his voice flat. ""This cannot be right. His temperature is below eighty degrees. The boy is freezing from the inside, and yet he is not shivering.""

I looked at the boy. Caleb’s lips were blue. His eyes were wide open, staring at the ceiling. He was not looking at the ceiling. He was staring at something that was not there.

I do not know what the white darkness outside has done, but it is colder than any winter, and it is making us dizzy. And that noise, that faint hissing sound, it seems closer now.",1,1763701388.0,stories,0,1.0,False

We just went there to swim as even though Patagonia is high in altitude the relentless Arizona summer sun will burn you up. We were lucky enough to secure a park bench for our things and eat lunch. Dave took this time to read the Bible. Matt began to further explain how Dave really does believe he was King David. We went swimming and the bombshell dropped when we were getting out to shower. 

Dave made a comment about one of the young girls showering. I don't care to repeat it but it is safe to say that Dave was a pedo. Inwas disgusted on the inside and set up my defenses even higher. 

We left the state park for the sabbath ceremony being held at the Tree of Life. The rabbi that Dave wanted to talk to led the festivities. We were all gathered in a circle about 10 of us. There came a moment when we all closed our eyes and the rabbi went around the circle providing blessings. I just was getting cult vibes from all of it from everyone wearing white and him spending extra time with a nonescorted pregnant woman. If it was his child I would not be surprised. 

The ceremony ended and I went outside to smoke while Dave chatted the ear off the cult leader. During the whole night I was planning on how to deal with Dave. I decided that I wanted to off him and I texted Ranger to prepare his house by playing loud music to muffle the screams before I could gag dave. I wanted to gut him. 

I had my handcuffs ready to string him up on the porch when we got into Tempe at Ranger's house except there was no music playing. Safe to say my plan was not going to have any accomplices. Ranger directed Matt and Dave to the guest bedroom where Ranger would have gay sex with his lover and Matt and Dave shared the bed. So much for the Bible.

While the pedo was sleeping Ranger talked me down from the evening's events and what I wanted to do. We stayed on the back porch drinking and smoking cigarettes. I agreed to take them to a coffee shop in the morning. 

After I dropped the rideshares off at xtreme bean, Ranger, the Texican and I went to pier 54 to get me some help with my lack of sleep. In order for me to manage my mental illness without drugs I need to get sleep and the journey with Matt and Dave left me with less than 5 hours of rest over a 48 hour period.

I ran into her the other day and made a couple jokes about something she said, and she followed me on IG later that day after work. She started liking my stories and messaging me a bit, nothing really 'romantic' but just normal chatting.

She messaged me one day asking if I could help her with some investment questions, which I was happy to do and I honestly thought she was married. At work the next day I saw her with some coworkers and she said we should set up a ""coffee date"". I didn't think much of it, and she asked to set something up one day after work. Being that I thought it was just platonic or whatever I asked if she'd want to grab a bite instead since coffee at 630 pm didn't sound appealing lol. Right around this time is when she casually mentioned in one convo she was in the process of finishing her divorce finalization, which caught me off guard. She said they were married about four years and separated for a few months. At this point I'm still not really thinking anything beyond friends would happen since the only reason we are doing anything together is for me to help her out.

She was down for dinner and we met up after work, but when I got there we just told stories and joked and got to know each other a little, we talked at dinner for like 2 hours and never once did she bring up the finance stuff. After we were about to leave she asked if we could go to the dessert spot next door so we went there for an hour or so and spent maybe a few minutes on finances.

I thought she was really cool and based on what she had said figured her marriage was long over and from what she said it sounded like she was just dealing with the legal processes and it was amicable for both parties. I decided to ask her out to dinner that weekend, and her response was pretty interesting: ""can I think about it?"". At first I just thought she wasn't into me like that but some friends pointed out she might be conflicted about dating while she's still married or unsure how serious of something she may be looking for which is fair.

She ends up the next day telling me a dinner date would be too romantically charged for where she's at in her relationship situation but that she would be down for less intense activities like hiking or things like that. I figure I'm just friendzoned at this point and accept my losses to move on.

She invited me to a lunch with some of her coworker friends that weekend and I decided to go, which is where I start getting mixed signals. At lunch she was doing things in front of our coworker that I just thought were... odd.. if she intended on being just friends. Some examples include casually taking fries off my plate, offering me bites of her food off her fork, and asking if I wanted to try her ice cream then using her spoon to feed me the bite. To me this is like cringy new couple stuff and I think even my women friends with no boundaries around sharing food/drinks wouldn't really do stuff like that with me. I also thought if she was really trying to just be friends why would she do this in front of our coworkers and potentially start rumors?

Anyways, after that we still have just been chatting at work and stuff like that, she still likes my posts/stories and we text sometimes. I asked her if she wanted to go on a hike this weekend and she was down for that, but I've honestly never been more confused about intentions from a girl. It feels like her words say one thing but her actions (to me) indicate she's interested, but I don't know really how to proceed. I feel like I should just continue being flirty and see where it goes starting from a more 'friends' level, but I guess I'm wondering if I'm interpreting these things wrong and she really is just not interested in me?",1,1763700968.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1p2pq8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1p2pq8p/i_accidentally_caught_my_girlfriend_cheating/,I accidentally caught my girlfriend cheating because of Snap Map,"Actually I am in love from past 5 years old. We have healthy relation from past year. We also planning to marry soon. Like every weekend, we planned to meet for our usual date. We chose our favorite coffee shop, the place where we always talked about our week, laughed at silly things, and discussed our plans for marriage. Everything felt normal just another happy weekend with the girl I loved.

We ordered two coffees and talked as usual. But after finishing, she suddenly said she needed to leave.

**“Why? What happened?”** I asked.

“I have work at home,” **she replied.** “My mom and dad aren’t home, so I need to make dinner.”

I trusted her. I always had.  
So I simply said, “Okay, go. Text me once you reach home.”

She nodded and left.

I stayed at the café for a while, scrolling through my phone. Out of boredom, I opened Snapchat and started watching Spotlight. Then a sudden thought crossed my mind. *Why not check Snap Map?* Just casually… nothing serious.

But what I saw shocked me.

Her location wasn’t anywhere near her home.  
She was somewhere else entirely.

A strange feeling hit my stomach. Confusion. Fear. Doubt.

***Why did she lie?***  
***Where did she actually go?***

My mind refused to accept anything without knowing the truth, so I decided to follow the Snap Map location.

When I reached the place, I found myself standing near a park. I looked around—and then I saw her.

She wasn’t alone. She was sitting with another boy.

My heart started beating so loudly it felt like the whole park could hear it. I moved closer, staying far enough that they couldn’t see me, but close enough to understand what was happening.

**And then I saw it.**

**The boy leaned forward and kissed her.**  
She didn’t push him away.  
She didn’t look uncomfortable.  
She smiled. She was happy.

In that single moment, I froze. Everything inside me turned numb. Five years of love… shattered in one second.

After a long, painful breath, I forced myself to walk toward them. When she saw me, her face changed instantly shock, guilt, fear, everything at once.

She quickly said, “He’s only my friend!”

But I didn’t say a word. I couldn’t.  
The boy looked at me, confused. He didn’t even know she had a boyfriend for five years. He looked just as betrayed.

It was painfully clear. She had lied to both of us.

I finally managed to speak, though my voice was calm in a way that surprised even me.

“Don’t call me from today.”

And I walked away.  
Her face turned red maybe with shame, maybe with regret—but nothing could fix what I had seen.

Later, I learned that even the boy broke up with her.  
She lost both of us the same day.

That day, Snapchat didn’t just show me a location.  
It showed me the truth. A truth I never wanted to see, but needed to know.",19,1763700767.0,cheating_stories,9,1.0,False

Now I'm not saying budgeting is bad or anything, but I feel like these reports are out of touch with reality for most people and really lack good advice. I'd rather be hearing ""make your coffee at home"" and those age old suggestions than making a budget that most Canadians probably couldn't get to balance right now. 

So besides budgeting, what are some financial/lifestyle hacks that you found and think should be talked about more. 

Things like:

\- Look for store discount days, like seniors and student discount days.   
\- if you are going to eat fast food like McDonalds and Burger King then at least use the app to get points for something free in the future.   
\- Adjusting your homes heat at certain times of the day to save on power/oil? If that's even effective haha   
\- Learn how to shop, compare prices and package sizes (grams, liters, etc.)

Maybe this is more of a rant than anything else, but I'm just tired of seeing terrible and out of touch suggestions in these news segments. 

\*Also, I couldn't help but laugh when they said most Canadian's cannot afford a 10K emergency bill if it came up. Lets be honest, most (including myself) probably couldn't afford a $500 emergency bill if it came up. ",4,1763700748.0,povertyfinancecanada,3,0.59,False

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I was excited to finally meet you in person. Friends are hard for me to make, and I already liked you just from talking to you in vc whenever we both happened to be there. You have a warm and gentle voice, and I probably even fell asleep to it a couple of times. You were kind and funny and interesting, and it wasn’t long before we were chatting as though we had always known each other. 

Suddenly, my sanctuary was filled with limitless warmth and color. The two hour drive was already worth it, but now that you were there, I am never there alone or without comfort. You turned lazy days when I would normally be waiting like a pet at the door into some of the most anticipated moments of my weekends. 

I can talk to you about anything. We have endless stories to match the chaos that we both have lived through. I am fascinated by you. If we never had to do anything else I think I could have one continuous conversation with you forever. We have passed countless joints back and forth, and taken turns crying in each other’s arms. We have laughed so hard I’ve nearly thrown up, and your voice has soothed me to sleep on restless nights. You aren’t shy to hold me, kiss me, look into my eyes. The entire shape of your face changes when you smile. I say stupid shit all the time just to see it and hear you laugh.

It never occurred to me how beautiful you are until I saw you in the sunlight. I hadn’t expected to look at you in that way and it caught me off guard. I think maybe that I hadn’t looked directly at you until that moment. Perhaps I was nervous. It had been a couple weeks since we had met in person and we had already grown so close. The sun cut through a gap in the leaves and centered on you like a spotlight. Your eyes kept changing colors and I couldn’t quite figure out which color I liked best. I always said I wasn’t into blondes, but you wear it like a curly halo. Your velvet skin turns to gold in the warmth, save for the shining little scar on your shoulder from when someone put out a cigarette.

Imagine the chances, the choices, the endless possibilities and impossibilities that led up to you and I standing face to face. Out of the billions of people that have ever existed, you and I managed to exist at the same time. Every mistake we have made, we have made so perfectly that we have managed to meet. Our souls have touched, if only for the briefest of moments. In the vast expanse of existence, we are but the chastest of kisses. This year, we have each other’s hands to hold and squeeze and kiss. Neither of us know where we go from here, but it seems that our time is almost up.

I don’t mean to sound hopeless, like there is no scenario in which we could ever make this work, but I just don’t want to be surprised when I hear from you less and less. I could never hold it against you, of course. That’s just the kind of life you lead. Attempting to change a single thing about you would be a crime worthy of death; however, I’m not sure what I’ll do once you are a stranger to me again. I’ll always remember what you mean to me in this moment, though. Anything you ever ask of me, I will do for you, no matter how far in the future. No amount of time or space between us could change what you have done for me.

We both know the time we have is limited. It’s silly to pretend any differently. There are only so many more cups of coffee that we’ll share, joints that we’ll pass back and forth, or jokes that I’ll get to tell you. When you’re far away from me, off on some fabulous adventure, I’ll be on the roof, smoking and talking to myself, reciting memories of us. I’ll swear I’ll hear your distant laugh behind a song we danced to together. My fingers will tremble over the places on my body where our souls touched. When the sunset is as red as it was that night, the Cincinnati skyline will flicker into view. You held me that night as we cried together over a friend of mine you never got to meet.

You told me that same day that I’m not allowed to fall in love with you, so I’m not going to say anything ridiculous like that. At least not to your face. Nah, I’ll post it on Reddit and forget about it so that in a few years I can come back and think about you for a little while. Funny how we’re such good friends though, right? Honestly, I sort of lied earlier. I mentioned that it’s difficult for me to make friends, but that’s not true. I find camaraderie everywhere I go without trying, but it’s true that it’s difficult to get anyone to stick around. You are one of few to dip below the surface, look past the smoke and mirrors and defense mechanisms, and actually see me. I won’t tell you I’m in love with you, but I think it every time I look at you. I would do anything to be able to help it if I could, believe me.

Hey, at least we never got far enough along to hate each other. Hell knows I’ve been through that scenario too many times, and I would never forgive myself if that was the way I lost you. The you I know now is the you that I will always remember. The you that I woke up next to this morning. The you that got up and made me coffee. The you that kissed me goodbye only a few hours ago and left a smudge on my glasses that I can’t bring myself to wipe away yet. The you that I will wake up without tomorrow.

The past few months have been happier and more colorful and full of life than any other times I can remember, and you have been part of that. To be graced with your presence in my life, even for only a fraction of a moment has been a true honor. I am comforted to know that I will have had and loved someone I did not hurt and who did not hurt me. Not everyone can say that. We’ve both been known to dodge death a time or two, but it will catch up to us someday. When that day comes and my life flashes before my eyes, hope I get to catch a glimpse of your eye color changing in the sunlight again.",1,1763699821.0,hopelessromantic,0,1.0,False
1p2pf8u,https://i.redd.it/m186ebmwgj2g1.png,Mega-Grow Tier List from a Solo Plants Player,"> S Tier - can fit in any deck with little problem

espresso fiesta - insanely strong finisher. works with pretty much any plant

apotatosaurus - super strong card, untrick and scaling is a super strong combination, and most roots are decent so it*s conjure is rarely bad.

bonk choy - 3 damage turn 1 is so good for plants to trade with very annoying turn 1 zombies. team-up means this card isn't chump block fodder late game and it helps protects strong units and correct trades.

> A Tier - can fit in most decks, but might need a little help.

cabbagepult - plants on average are slightly less statted than zombies and caggabe can fix that without all on it's own. 2-cost 3/4 is insane stats, but after that it just holds your heights lane. you also dont want too many in your deck cause if you have one out, the next one you draw is a brick.

fertalizer - 4/4 is insane stats to add. though it does make anything that gets this super easy to hit with rocket.

clique peas - reliant on luck, but can be really good the more you have. it either pops off hard, or is just a body to block with that's not terrible to draw late game assuming you've played 1 or 2 earlier.

onion rings - this is reliant on good cheap / weak cards to be in the meta, and fortunately for rings, there's plenty of that. fmn, clique, bonk, starch lord, both potato mines, almost anything ≤3 cost in kabloom, etc. so many cards with great effects to buff to become nightmares on the field. might be S if plants had good draw. generally a bad conjure cause you dont want to nerf things out of it's niche.

captain cucumber - his low stats make him ez bait for control tricks, whether it's reducing atk, or outright killing him. he helps with plants low draw and legendary conjure usually means it's gonna be at least a decent card. plus, mega-grow has buffs and bonus attacks, exactly what cc wants.

repeat moss - you're never safe. i used to hate this card until i actually made a deck for him and he popped off getting me otks. super fun card to use and can fit in most decks as a alternate wincon, but is also easily replaced for a different wincon that synergizes better in the deck.

umbrella leaf - i might overvalue this, but i think it's a high skill card that when played right can really put your opponent in a lose/lose position. using it to bait/force removal imo is it's best role. i use it almost like an alternate fmn.

savage spinach - +2 buff to field and hand can be big. it makes threats that the opponent might not be ready for as well as being relatively easy to play cause umbrella and bonk are both 1-cost team-up plants, and the team-up allows for improper lane shenanigans. fun card to use.

gatling pea - peas are better, but i still think there are plenty of mid peas. though i do think gatling is the best of them just cause he can deal so much damage in a turn. i also find gatling harder to pull off than spinach cause of the lack of good 1-cost peas that you *want* to run and dont mind sacc'ing

> B Tier - pretty good, but kinda niche

plant food - game clutcher, but it's hard to not feel like version that's cheaper with no 1/1 buff would be better. i don't mean to make comparisons, but lurch is a 2-cost bonus attack, which means the value of a 1/1 buff is 2-cost on this card which is expensive. bonus attacks are really strong, so it's hard for this card to be bad.

potted powerhouse - pp is one of my favorite cards. so many ways to get this card growing and a well timed pp with time to shine can quickly throw the game in your favor. it does require you to draw it early and *not* play it, which is kinda slow and doing mid damage now is usually better than doing big damage later. a brick that gets stronger the longer it's bricked.

bananasaurus rex - i wish this card was better but then i think it'd be op. it's rare for b.rex to do anything because it's immediately a threat you need to address now before it gets out of hand. that means it's good removal bait, but it's also a 4-cost removal bait, so it doesn't feel great to play for that purpose. innate double strike is really hard to properly balance.

typical beanstalk - it's a more conditional, more expensive version of cabbagepult. though the conjure is nice, and you probably want to run more than 2 in a deck unlike cabbage. can thrive in the right deck, and is just a 3-cost 3/3 in the wrong one. sucks it has no bean synergy.

coffee grounds - double strike is great, but it suffers from success just like b.rex and it's often covered the same turn it's played cause bonus attacks are so strong. good thing it's cheap, i usually just use it to counter opponents envi and dont try to use it as a wincon.

banana split - decent stats for cost, and good tempo for creating the half-bananas. though, it does take some forethought on placement in early game to maximize benefit, otherwise it just makes 1 hb. i'd like to see this get the bombergranate treatment of making one ""here"" despite that breaking the ""split"" aspect of the card.

black eye'd peas - man the nerf is felt on this card. it really needs a bit of help to kinda get over the 2/2 hump that makes many plants susceptible to easy removal. though, i think he's a well balanced card for anti-trick cards. doesn't prevent them, just lightly punishes them for playing and i think more cards with an effect similar to that should exist.

muscle sprout - i think this is kinda slept on. super fun card to play and can be surprisingly strong. though it does kinda rely on a deck that doesnt have big costly guysand has a ton of cheap spammy things, which i dont think is very meta right now. still, even just some puff shrooms or maybe a starch lord with him can be pretty strong. now that i think about it, he should be moved lower at least below grape power, but i could see even high C.

pod father - maybe i just dont use peas enough, but i find them to still not be *that* good comoared to other options. pod father lives and dies by how meta peas are and out of strategies, i'd says peas are a B average, so that's where p.father goes.

grape power - great card, doesnt do much in terms of synergy, and kinda expensive. it works best on mid-range cards imo like 3/3 and higher, but stronger cards aren't really *needing* this and it's kind of a ""win more"" card. like you don't really *need* the stats but it's a flex on your opponent. tho, certain cards like dino-roars or repeat *love* this. big stats and a card draw / bonus attack feels real good.

split pea - great damage, and great bungie and nibble bait. it's best on combustible cause he wants his powers, but on other heroes it's kinda less useful for that purpose at least. mid to late game it can be a cheap trader but with 1hp it's not best to rely on it. not much use in any deck other than peas and repeat, unless you just really hate gentleman.

grow-shroom - it's fertalizer's weaker cousin. great for getting 1/x's into 3atk to avoid weed spray and rolling stones. it's also good tempo, a buff on a plant and a 2/1 on board for a trade is real nice. tho needing a plant on field to play this can make it a brick if you can't develope anything in the first place. still, 4/3 stats that get spread in a 3-cost is pretty decent.

torchwood - i find this to be a weird card. it's a card you want only in a pea deck, but it's not a pea itself so it doesn't get the buffs peas get from podfather or work as fusion for gatling. then you kinda have to determine whether running this is better than just running more peas that'll allow those synergies to be more consistent. it can still perform in pea decks so it's not terrible.

pea patch - rip this guy. had like 1 week of fun, then yanked right back down. still, a decent card, 2/3 means it'll usually live turn 2 and open up for synergies. no more fearing bungie to get off gatling on curve. this is anti-tempo for the exact same buff grow-shroom gives so it's lower.

vegetation mutation - a cheap buff card is kinda what mega-grow is missing. it's not great at filling it's role but it's the only one besides embiggen that can. can also help in situations where zombie have a few envi's down making it hard to effectively trade. also cosmoss with this can get pretty.

lily of the valley - i used to overvalue this, mainly cause i used a velociradishes and this pairs beautifully with them. though, lily in general really wants team-ups to get good value, but team-ups dont really want a lily in their decks, or just can't cause green shadow is like the only effective mega-grow team-up user and has access to leafy and pea stuff that's just better than team-up decks, which are usually amphib on citron and beta. lily just doesn't have a great place despite being in the right class.

> C Tier - woefully okay

pod fighter - again, maybe i dont use peas enough, but this seems really expensive and limiting and why run this when gatling exists? seems like everything gatling can do, this just does worse.

doubled mint - removal bait the card. even when it doesnt get removed, it still needs a coupke turns to shine and if the opponent keeps fronting it, it's health will just stay at 1-2 making it very manageable despite the 8+ damage. it needs help, but when it gets it, it's hard focused before it does much. you want this on the field early, but it'll rarely be alive when you get spinach, and even then, this needs hp more than atk. being buffed in hand is nice, but by that point it's turn 5 and you're playing a 2-cost 3/2. it will die.

pea pod - similar issue to doubled mint, but scales slower. though, it at least has pea synergies to get some quick buffs from pod father, and that's nice. a bit less of immediate removal bait.

bamboozle - it's only this high cause 6/6 stats is decently high for plants. it also can be conjured be apot and evo'ing this the next turn is real good for apot. though being a decent conjure from 1 card is not gonna save this.

half-banana - i know fry just had a fruit deck with this, but it's still a 2-cost 2/2 with a very conditional buff to a muddy tribe. i say muddy cause fruit wasn't designed to be a part of 1 or 2 classes and it's kinda all over the place. it's hard to make a coherent deck cause you frequently want out of class cards, especially pear cub.

plucky clover - idk what the role of this card is supposed to be. it's expensive, and has a random chance to just be kinda bad. great for newer players to see cool event cards they normally wouldn't see, but it's also an event card itself so why wouldn't a new player just craft the event card they really want rather than a gamble on this. imo, this needs to be cheaper with lower stats

moon bean - the strat this supports is a fun but terribly inconsistent and the card itself is weak as hell. who loves having their 3-cost get rolling stoned? 

party thyme - a card i think should be good but i can't find a good use for it. i think that's cause there's no cheap bonus attacks except for time to shine, which is far too valueable to use it turn 2 with this just to get one card. if you play this turn 1 and coffee grounds on 2 this is still probably dying to whatever is fronting it. late game it doesnt have the stats to stick around for your stuff with double-strike to do their thing. maybe with apot and espresso it can help guarantee a kill cause apot should ramp with each attack, even so, that strat is strong enough on its own i dont think pt is worth the card slot, nor the delay by a turn to even play this instead of just winning on turn 7. maybe its issue is that it's buffing something that's already so strong without it that makes it so obsolete.

red plant it - it's a 5-cost envi that might not even get you value other than buffing the pp in hand. it's just too high cost and easily countered by anything as low as 1-cost, and making that gamble can lose you the game. find a different way to win.

super phat beets - a late game ""finisher"" that's soley dependant on the state of the board which can vary wildly over the course of a game. it's just inconsistent and apotato is right there costing the same amount, even the same tribe.

whipvine - 6/5 is okay stats for 5-cost, but imo moving a zombie isn't always a beneficial strat. it also does *nothing* after that. it's just a big body like a better smoosh shroom.

repeater - double strike needs decent stats to be good. this has bad stats making it really open to removal. he needs help, bad. but if he gets it, bonus attack get to be op. i also just realized this was buffed to 2/*3* so put it above plucky clover. surviving to get buffs or torchwood protection can go much further.

skyshooter - a more expensive version of cabbage. though, cabbage stats for cost feel better than this, and a mid-game card that's only purpose is having high stats with the requirement of *needing* heights is not great. you can often be pressured to play in heights early and then this is clog, amd it's clog if you draw It early, again not an issue with cabbage. if you plan on running this outside of peas, just use cabbage instead.

sweet pea - it does exactly what it says it does and nothing more. it's an abyssmal gravitree with none of the good stuff that make tree good.

fire pea - why does this not have bullseye? again, maybe this performs real well in pea decks, but i just can't even see this doing much in a pea deck. there are other peas that have some sort of bonus that makes them worth it.

sweet potato - imo make this guardian, what is it doing here? moving zombies i guess is a mega-grow thing, but guardian also has hot date, gravitree, and garlic so it's not an exclusive thing, neither is root to mega-grow. i think this makes sweet p. have a hard time finding a place amongst the leafy peas.

> D Tier - Please Help

flourish - plants have bad draw, right? so flourish should be a good card. in practice though, it just 
takes a slot in your deck, and costs 3 to do nothing right now. even later turns like 5 or 6 where you can be pretty happy playing a 3-cost and some other stuff, this feels terrible to play cause it doesnt affect the board when you play it. even in decks where you focus around dino-roar effects it's better to just focus on conjuring rather than using this card.

cosmic pea - remember how repeater was no good at a 2/2? well, lets give those same stats to a card that's double the cost. even with the conjure, it's still awful to play. most zombie 1-costs can trade with it, and it's conjure is slow. it's just so little, so late, and so slow.

banana peel - tbh, this could probably be top of D. i just hate that they changed this to conjure fruit instead of a banana, even though that was a buff. i had a *really* fun banana deck that was only bananas and tricks, lost a lot, but was still fun playing b.launcher at 6/6. getting bananas from this was more important to the deck's feel than i thought, cause after the change that deck just felt wrong so now i hate this card more than i should. still, moving a zombie in most situations isn't super important imo. sometimes it can be a save to pull an amphib out so you can kill it but at that point i think you have issues with the deck you might need to address if you practically crumble to a ducky tuber.",1,1763699765.0,PvZHeroes,7,0.6,False

The dark roast, brewed from self-roasted Brazilian beans, was served in a striking red patterned cup and was exactly what a dark roast should be: robust, deeply aromatic, and possessing a rich, low-acidity body with notes of bitter chocolate. The accompanying Coffee Jelly was the ideal partner. Served in a clear glass bowl and crowned with a dollop of fresh lemon sorbet, the jelly itself was firm, deeply flavored, and carried the same satisfying bitterness as the coffee, which was instantly balanced by the sweet sourness😍",1,1763699185.0,u_5second10,0,1.0,False

I really miss you, you know. It hasn’t even been that long. I never had a chance to really show you how I feel about you because of my stupid mania psychosis episodes. 

I was doing so well, so so well coming clean for a bit, I was building muscle, changing my diet because of you, a girl from a city across the country. 

A girl that really, I shouldn’t have been this attracted to. But oh my, even from the first time I met you I thought: “Wow, I may be in trouble here”. 

I was so right, it was that time we looked into each other’s eyes. Your brown, dark coffee eyes. I fell for you at that moment, it was electric. It was forbidden. I loved it. 

I was afraid at first, I think. I was afraid by your age. Maybe that’s why you pulled away too? Because we agreed to hangout before you went silent. 

Silence not only from you, but from my higher self. I lost myself around that time I believe, taking upper drugs has given me a trip I certainly am never to forget. I am completely. Fucked. 

But, reality sucks. I never even really knew you, I got carried away. It’s not you that has hurt me so bad, well. The last time I saw you, yes you were avoiding me it fucking tore me apart and I have been spiralling to figure out what the fuck was wrong. 

I hurt myself, I hurt myself because I have no idea how you feel. I should have never reached out, I should have just followed my heart instead of my brain. 

I hurt myself because, I could literally see how much pain you were in, yet I neglected it and followed my stupid little fantasy. 

I just, I can’t make sense of it all. I am trying to remember it all but I can’t…I feel horrible for playing pathetic games with you when I should have just talked to you early. 

I would do anything to reach out, to talk to you as my baseline self, but he doesn’t exist anymore I’m afraid. 

I’m not doing well right now, I am suffering and just a message from you, asking me if I’m okay, a way to just mend things…it would go so far. I’m so sorry.

1p2p8m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AboutAI/comments/1p2p8m7/whats_purpose_of_life_here_is_that/,what's purpose of life ? here is that,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Well where is it liquidated? Somebody spill their coffee on a hard drive and lose many much btc?!

The money went somewhere- In the pocket of traders/investment brokers/market manipulators/exchanges, government, etc.

As long as big players are making that kind of squid from this here ball game, this ball game right here, they're not going to let it sink. No way.

As to the ins and outs and how they use that money to attract more traders/hodlers, I don't have a clue, but they will...

And it's in their best interest to bring more money in and get that ath way way up there again, so they can attract even more patrons to this art.

I once read a comment here that suggested it was the very chaotic nature of crypto that attracts more people than the big athighs.

So...but or sell, and yea Mercury is indeed retrograde.

Told entirely from the therapist’s perspective (through case notes, emails, texts, therapy sessions).
 
Main character is a young man, an English major.
	•	He becomes severely depressed after realizing he’s ordinary/mediocre he thought he was special.
	•	He develops a crush on a girl at a coffee shop, misinterprets her friendliness, becomes obsessive, and spirals further.
	•	He develops delusions and schizophrenia-like symptoms and ultimately kills himself.
	•	A key scene: he visits a museum and sees a painting/artwork of a small man facing away, wearing a hat, holding a briefcase, surrounded by stars, all in blue tones.
	•	The book cover is this artwork, and the title of the book is the name of the artwork (I don’t remember the exact title).
	•	The book is short, around 180–200 pages, in English.
