1m3sodx,https://i.redd.it/7mnuiajl2tdf1.png,Wellness Products That Changed My Self-Care Routine (Reviews),"Hey there, fellow self-care enthusiast! :)

Can we just talk for a hot minute about how self-care has become this whole *thing* now? I mean, not that I'm complaining – lord knows we all need more reasons to pamper ourselves. But seriously, have you noticed how the wellness game has completely evolved? Gone are the days when ""self-care"" just meant bubble baths and face masks (though don't get me wrong, those are still fire).

I've been on this wellness journey for a while now, and let me tell you – I've tried A LOT of products. Some were total duds, some were okay, and then there were those magical unicorns that completely transformed my routine. Today I'm spilling the tea on the products that genuinely changed the game for me.

# The Face Mask Revolution That Actually Worked

# Korean Sheet Masks: Not Just Instagram Hype

Okay, real talk – I was super skeptical about the whole Korean skincare craze. I mean, how different could a sheet mask really be? Turns out, **very different**.

I started with the [DERMAL Korean Collagen Face Mask set](https://amzn.to/4kLdpbq) ($11.99 for 16 masks), and honestly? Game changer. These aren't your typical drugstore masks that leave your skin feeling tight and weird. The **panthenol and collagen combo** actually made my skin feel like I'd just gotten a professional facial.

What I love about these:

* They stay put (no sliding around like a drunk penguin)
* The essence doesn't drip everywhere
* My skin looks genuinely plumper the next morning
* **4K+ people bought these last month** – clearly I'm not the only one obsessed

**Real talk verdict**: These turned me into a sheet mask convert. I do one twice a week now, and people actually ask if I've had work done. Nope, just good old-fashioned Korean skincare magic.

# Clay Masks That Don't Strip Your Soul

Clay masks used to be this masochistic ritual where I'd slather mud on my face and then suffer through 20 minutes of feeling like my skin was shrinking. Enter the [AROIC 4-Pack Clay Mask Set](https://amzn.to/4kMovgm) ($12.99).

This set comes with **four different masks**:

* Vitamin C Turmeric (for brightening)
* Dead Sea Mud (for deep cleaning)
* Rose (for hydration)
* Green Tea (for soothing)

The **turmeric mask** is my ride-or-die. It brightens my skin without making me look like I've been attacked by a sandblaster. Plus, it smells amazing – like a fancy spa instead of pond scum.

# The Tools That Made Me Feel Bougie (In the Best Way)

# Jade Rollers: Worth the Hype or Instagram Nonsense?

I'll be honest – I bought my first jade roller mostly because it looked pretty on my bathroom counter. Shallow? Maybe. Life-changing? Absolutely.

The [huefull Genuine Jade Roller & Gua Sha Set](https://amzn.to/4m2GbFC) ($7.99) became my morning ritual. And before you roll your eyes at another influencer trend, hear me out on this one.

**What actually happens when you use these:**

* The cool jade feels incredible on puffy morning skin
* The **lymphatic drainage** is real – my face genuinely looks less bloated
* It forces me to take 5 minutes for myself every morning
* The gua sha tool hits those jaw tension spots I didn't even know existed

FYI, I keep mine in the fridge. Cold jade on tired skin? *Chef's kiss*

The key is consistency. I use it every morning while listening to podcasts, and my skin definitely looks more sculpted. Plus, 3K+ people bought this exact set last month, so I'm clearly not alone in my jade addiction.

# Sleep Game Changers (Because Beauty Rest is Real)

# Silk Pillowcases: Not Just for Fancy People

Can we talk about how I thought silk pillowcases were just bougie nonsense? Yeah, I was wrong. SO wrong.

I got the [Mulberry Silk Pillowcase](https://amzn.to/3GKVVyc) ($8.43) after my hairstylist mentioned it (shoutout to professionals who actually know things), and it's been a total game-changer for both my skin and hair.

**Here's what's actually different:**

* My hair doesn't look like I fought a tornado overnight
* **No more sheet marks** on my face in the morning
* It stays cool all night (hello, hot sleepers!)
* My skincare products don't get absorbed by my pillowcase

The cooling effect alone made it worth it. I run hot at night, and this has seriously improved my sleep quality.

# Aromatherapy Sleep Masks: Bougie or Brilliant?

Sleep masks always seemed extra to me, but the [Umisleep Lavender Eye Mask](https://amzn.to/4kQqoc2) ($9.99) changed my mind. This isn't just any sleep mask – it's **weighted with lavender**.

The gentle pressure feels like a hug for your face, and the lavender scent actually helps me fall asleep faster. I travel with this thing now because hotel rooms are chaos for my sleep schedule.

**Why it works:**

* The weight triggers pressure points that promote relaxation
* Real lavender (not synthetic fragrance nonsense)
* **Hot or cold therapy** – you can heat it up or chill it
* Helps with sinus pressure too

# The Unexpected MVP Products

# Red Light Therapy: Science Fiction or Science Fact?

Okay, this one's going to sound weird, but stay with me. The [Red Light Therapy Face Mask](https://amzn.to/4lCahA7) ($99.99) looked like something from a sci-fi movie, but the results are legit.

I was skeptical because... well, it looks insane. But after using it consistently for a month, my skin texture improved noticeably. The **7 different colored lights** target different skin concerns, and the anti-aging results are actually visible.

**What it does:**

* Stimulates collagen production (the real deal, not marketing fluff)
* Reduces fine lines over time
* Helps with acne scarring
* Takes 20 minutes, 3x per week

Is it expensive? Yes. Does it work? Also yes. Sometimes you've got to invest in the weird stuff.

# Essential Oil Sleep Combos: Not Your Grandma's Aromatherapy

I used to think essential oils were for people who believed in crystal healing (no judgment!), but the [ASUTRA Silk Eye Pillow](https://amzn.to/4kQ4GVH) filled with lavender and flax seeds actually works.

This thing serves multiple purposes:

* **Weighted pressure** for anxiety relief
* Natural lavender for sleep
* Can be heated or cooled
* Blocks light completely

It's like meditation, aromatherapy, and sleep aid all rolled into one. I use it during my afternoon ""power naps"" (yes, I nap, don't @ me), and it knocks me out in the best way.

# The Real Talk Section: What Actually Matters

Look, I'm not going to pretend that buying products is the answer to all of life's problems. But here's what I've learned from actually using these wellness products consistently:

**The good stuff:**

* Having a routine forces you to slow down
* Taking care of yourself feels good (revolutionary, I know)
* Small daily rituals add up to bigger changes
* Quality products actually perform better than cheap alternatives

**The reality check:**

* None of this works if you're not consistent
* Expensive doesn't always mean better (that $7.99 jade roller is proof)
* Your skin and needs are unique – what works for me might not work for you
* **You still need the basics**: good sleep, water, sunscreen, and not touching your face constantly

# My Current Routine (Because You Asked)

**Morning:**

1. Jade roller while drinking coffee (5 minutes of forced mindfulness)
2. Whatever serum I'm testing that week
3. Sunscreen (always sunscreen!)

**Evening:**

1. Face mask 2-3x per week (rotating between clay and sheet masks)
2. Red light therapy 3x per week while scrolling TikTok
3. Lavender sleep mask if I'm stressed

**Weekly:**

* One ""fancy"" self-care Sunday with multiple masks and tools
* Silk pillowcase gets washed (high maintenance but worth it)

# The Bottom Line

Here's the thing about wellness products – most of them are nice-to-haves, not must-haves. But the ones that actually work? They become part of your identity. I'm now the person who travels with a jade roller and has strong opinions about sheet mask ingredients.

**My actual recommendations:**

* Start with one product and use it consistently for a month
* **Don't buy everything at once** (trust me on this one)
* Read reviews, but remember everyone's skin is different
* Price doesn't always indicate quality

The products I've mentioned here range from $7.99 to $79.99, so there's something for every budget. The key is finding what makes YOU feel good and sticking with it.

Ever wondered if wellness products are just fancy placebos? Maybe some are. But if a $12 sheet mask makes me feel like I've got my life together, then honestly, that's worth it. Self-care doesn't have to be complicated or expensive – it just has to be consistent.

What wellness products have changed your routine? Drop a comment and let me know – I'm always looking for the next game-changer! :/

*P.S. - None of these products are going to fix underlying stress, replace therapy, or solve major skin issues. Please see actual professionals for serious concerns. But for everyday wellness and feeling fancy? These are my tried-and-true favorites.*",1,1752919839.0,TheBeautyCircle,0,1.0,False
1m3snlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1m3snlm/explore_why_the_bodum_bistro_electric_kettle_is/,Explore Why the Bodum Bistro Electric Kettle Is Perfect for Tea Lovers,"Finding a reliable electric kettle that balances design, functionality, and safety isn’t always an easy task, but the Bodum 11451-01US managed to leave me rather impressed. As someone who drinks tea like it’s a religion and occasionally dabbles in instant soups or pour-over coffee, having an efficient kettle in my arsenal is non-negotiable. This compact yet powerful water kettle is undoubtedly a standout for small households, dorm rooms, or even office spaces. While it ticks many boxes for function and style, it isn't without its drawbacks, making it an intriguing choice worthy of dissecting.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me was the clean and modern look of this small yet capable electric kettle. Its sleek plastic construction, combined with stainless steel accents, doesn’t scream ""luxury"" but rather “practical elegance.” The lightweight design, at just 1.06 pounds, allowed me to move it around the kitchen without much hassle, which is a bonus when you're juggling too many mugs of tea. The BPA-free plastic is also a reassuring choice for health-conscious users like me, not trapping any weird smells even after multiple uses. Measuring in at 7 x 4 x 7.75 inches, the Bodum fits nicely on my counter without taking up unnecessary space—I’ve had to retire a few bulkier kettles over the years just because of their footprint!

**Functionality and Ease of Use**  
I appreciated how effortless it was to operate this kettle. The manual on/off switch conveniently built into the handle makes starting the boiling process straightforward. It heats up 17 ounces of water—more than enough for a solo tea binge or two generous coffee mugs—in about four minutes. Oh, and let’s not forget the steam sensor and automatic shut-off, which eased my perpetual fear of accidentally leaving appliances running. However, the lack of more automatic programming options might disappoint those who enjoy a bit of customization.  

[Find the best price for Bodum 11451-01US on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b00851lrr6/)

**Performance and Energy Efficiency**  
One thing that stood out was the unexposed heating element, hidden at the base of the kettle. Not only did this make cleaning much easier, but it also meant I could place it safely on different surfaces without fretting about heat damage. The rapid-boil feature impressed me the most; it saved me time during busy mornings, where every second matters. A power consumption of 700 W is reasonable compared to some bulkier options that guzzle energy, which made me feel less guilty about all my steaming cups of chai. Still, larger families or heavy users may find the smaller 17-ounce capacity a tad limiting.

**Good Points**  
- Compact design that’s perfect for small spaces.  
- Unexposed heating element enhances both safety and usability.  
- BPA-free plastic construction reassures health-conscious users.  
- Rapid-boil function saves time during hectic mornings.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Limited to only 17 ounces of boiling capacity, which isn't ideal for larger households.  
- Lack of digital or advanced features like temperature settings.  
- Manual on/off switch might feel too basic for tech enthusiasts.  

**Safety Features**  
We’ve all had those moments when we walk away mid-boil and forget to return. The anti-boil dry technology combined with the steam sensor ensures that this kettle shuts off as soon as it senses dryness or achieves boiling point. It’s these thoughtful little additions that made me feel confident leaving it running while brewing tea in another room. However, I personally would’ve liked an audible alert just to let me know it’s done—it’s too quiet for my scatterbrained nature!

**Competitive Options**  
If I had to stack up the Bodum 11451-01US against competitors, there are a few worth mentioning. The Mueller Ultra Kettle offers a similar clean design with an added temperature control feature, which some may find appealing for specialty teas or pour-over coffee. However, it’s bulkier and may not fit as snugly into tight kitchen spaces like the Bodum does. On the other side of the spectrum, you’ve got basic models like the Hamilton Beach Glass Kettle, which comes with a higher capacity but lacks the BPA-free assurance that the Bodum provides.

What makes the Bodum stand out is its attention to detail in efficiency and compactness. Unlike rivals, it focuses on simplicity without sacrificing key elements like safety and energy use. Nevertheless, if you need multiple features and a larger capacity, some of its competitors might edge it out.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Figuring out whether this is worth the investment largely depends on what you prioritize. If you’re someone like me who values a portable, efficient, and safe water kettle for small-scale use, the Bodum is absolutely worth a look. Larger families or individuals with specific heating needs might find it limiting without the extra capacity or programmable settings. That being said, the reliability and ease of cleaning offer a good bang for your buck in this category. Plus, it feels sturdy enough to last a good long while, despite its lightweight design.

I noted yesterday there was a bit of a kerfuffle between 2 nurses after one had just taken my obs (if it matters, it was a cardiac hospital and I've just had a stent installed).  The nurse had used the BP sleeve on my upper right arm (over the top of my shirt) and had connected the pulse reader peg to digit 2 on my right hand, then did my temperature with the ear gun thingy.  A more senior nurse in the vicinity had spotted the peg on my right hand and said to the nurse doing the obs that she was doing it wrong (in a round-about way) and the pulse check needed to be on the finger on the opposite side to where you are doing the BP test as it totally messes up the readings otherwise.

I left the ward to ger a coffee a few mins later and there was an argument going on between them at the desk with the 'lower ranked' one saying she'd never been told about this alleged issue during training.

Purely out of curiosity I would like to know what the official correct procedure is because in my 3 days there and umpteen obs checks, the senior nurse was the only one out of about 10 different nurses that had put the peg on my left hand.  All the other nurses did the BP and peg on the same side.",2,1752919396.0,NursingUK,6,0.75,False

Me, Dave, Tyler, Greg, and the twins. We loaded it with gear, beer, and bad jokes. The lake was smooth and still and calm. No signal, no forecast of storms. Just sky and trees and water.

The storm came fast as we were on the water though. The wind whipped at the boat and rain blurred everything. We capsized, everyone fell out. I couldn't see where anyone went in the black water.

I came to alone on the muddy shore. I was soaked, shivering, and alone.

I walked for days out there. I saw no roads or people. On the fourth day, a camper found me and called the rangers. They gave me a blanket, hot coffee, and a phone.

I called my wife immediately and she answered. I said asked for help, glad to hear her voice.

 “You’re already home.”

I didn’t understand. I said I’d just come out of the woods. She told me I’d already returned two days ago. The sheriff had brought me home. 

I said everyone was dead, that I’d barely survived.

I told her to come get me. When she pulled into the station, he was already there in the car. He had on my clothes, the same hair, same voice, same scar on the chin from when I fell off my bike in fifth grade.

He froze when he saw me. Big smile. 

I stepped forward. So did he. We spoke at the same time. Said the same thing. My wife looked between us, her face pale. I tried to prove who I was. So did he.

Where we met. What she said the first time she stayed over. The name of the dog we buried in spring. Every memory, he knew.

Not just the facts. The feelings. The smells. The quiet details no one else could know. I started shaking.

Because I knew it was real.

He remembered being in the water. He remembered clawing up the bank, the hunger, the cold, the taste of the first coffee back.

He remembered being found, and I did too.

I turned to my wife, asked her who she believed. She looked at me, then at him.

“I don’t know,” she whispered, shooken and confused.

Neither of us moved or spoke.

Because I understood now.

Something walked out of those woods with my face, my voice, my memories. And the world let it return, because I was gone.

It wasn’t just pretending. It knew everything. It had taken my place. And it was going to take my life. But I came back alive. ",4,1752919364.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

I guess if you’re the right person, reading the following won’t be too unappealing. 😃 I didn’t mean to write .. all of that. See you at the finish line. ]

Down below is the post I just shared to my local mom’s Facebook group but it probably won’t be approved till the morning. I realized while I’m sitting here waiting to see if any admins are still up that maybe I don’t want to work with someone I kind of know. This is a smallish community where I am. Although I’m desperately and genuinely seeking a business partner of sorts, more-so an ally in micro business ownership (and failure) where we both build each other up with each person’s area of expertise contributing to mutual successes (ohmygoshhh let a girl dare to dream cause I know you think that sounds perfect too 🤩), maybe I don’t want that partner to be someone I could bump into at any store any time I ever go out.

I like online business ownership because it’s ok if I don’t shower this week.. I probably will next week..🤞🏻 Regardless, when I ~~go grocery shopping in the middle of the work week at 2pm~~ do whatever, whenever.. I do not care to see my only other team member while I’m out or more specifically, have them see me 🫣😂.

So, am I allowed to offer the same opportunity to someone here? Hopefully this doesn’t get me banned.. I’m not looking to sell anything, I actually want to *give* things to whomever is the right person. I know so many of us are working on making our first few dollars of profit and there are so many amazing creators out there, in here I guess, who could benefit greatly from being given access to the tools Canva Pro offers. I want to give that to someone completely for free, who can in return give me feedback on the digital tool I’m creating in Excel for makerspace type product sellers / solopreneurs. You can also have my digital business management tool for free which should massively increase your ability to run a business and reconcile your finances with ease so you can focus on creating instead of fretting about your online presence and administrative responsibilities. I’m hoping to sell it for a one time payment of $150cad - - *NOT CURRENTLY SELLING IT, PLEASE DON’T BAN ME FOR TALKING ABOUT IT* - - but I need help making sure my product is high quality and aesthetic because the tool itself is top tier. 

If all you do is give me valuable feedback on my project in exchange for the subscription, that’s perfect. If you want to do more, I’m in. I have access to and ownership of approximately one kajillion PLR/MRR files thanks to some late night Etsy rips. I’d love to also share some of those in exchange for you editing them and making them more attractive and sellable. We can negotiate arrangements where you pretty up x number of files for me and you may choose y number of files to have all to yourself to fix up and sell and I’ll delete them from my own collection entirely. Or maybe you do all the rebranding and content prep and I’ll build the product website and social media pages and make the posts and we split the earnings. *Whatever*, basically. ☺️ We’ll figure that out when it’s time. 

Anyway… I didn’t mean to do what I always do and make that a whole novel. No wonder I don’t have enough time for my grand ideas at the moment 🫠. Let me know if anything above or below this paragraph caught your attention and you know you’d be a ~~great~~ good enough business partner.

Happy (side) hustling 😎. Bye!

**TL;DR: Here’s the post I shared to my local FB mom’s group**.

“Hey friends,

I’m wondering if there are any mamas who do all the custom design type things, like with a Cricut and/or a laser or maybe even woodworking, who would enjoy a totally free Canva Pro subscription in exchange for some feedback and guidance on a project I’m working on. Nothing excessive, and you’re free to walk away whenever you want if you wish to.

I have an extra spot in my Canva Teams plan and I could really use someone to chat with on a semi regular basis about a few things. I’m looking for someone who either currently runs a micro business (like where you’re the only employee kinda thing) and is absolutely swamped and needs some relief with order/business management kinda thing and/or would like a simple website built for themselves (also free for you as long as you work closely with me and are actively engaged in the process) *or* someone who is busy enough and motivated enough to turn their work into a business but you don’t know how to make that jump. I’d love to help you work through that side of things if you could help me with some creative aspects and also discuss the ins and outs of your work with me for my own purposes (I’m building something with creators and makers in mind and I’d love to bounce ideas off of one who isn’t me lol).

Really hoping to connect with someone who is familiar with Canva already and who is business minded and looking for help with growth. Honestly I’m terrible at meeting for coffee or hanging out in general so the Canva Pro subscription on me is my way of taking you out for lunch every month. ☺️ It’d be ideal if we could be bffs and chat about everything but also if you just want a work relationship, we can schedule a weekly meeting. We’ll chat for an hour or so about my business and product and about yours as well, half an hour for us each to share where we’re at and what we’ll be doing over the following week kinda thing.

FYI you’d keep your existing Canva account and everything you currently have in your Projects folder will remain private, as will all future work unless specifically shared with me. The team can’t see anything that anyone else is doing except for you can all see my brand kits. Whatever weird or crazy or proprietary design stuff you’ve got going on, that stays with you.“",1,1752919114.0,sidehustle,0,1.0,False

As the world evolves, people grow more advanced—empowered by knowledge. Yet the real problem lies in their assumption: that humans understand everything.

But some things exist beyond imagination. Beyond thought.

This world is woven with belief and fate. Nearly everyone worships divine gods—or, in rarer cases, devils. These beliefs spark rituals. Stories. Some uplifting. Some terribly dark.

This is a story about someone caught in such a web.

Max wasn’t just a college sports star—he was the kind of boy who thrived in the spotlight but feared the silence. Beneath his playful arrogance was a hunger: not just for fame, but for proof. Proof that the world’s fears were fake. That belief was a superstition waiting to be mocked.

His YouTube channel wasn’t just content—it was rebellion. He broke taboos, flirted with the dark, dared society to punish him. And his audience adored him. Or they used to… before the comment.

One Sunday morning, while sipping coffee and scrolling through praise and controversy, Max froze. A comment stood out from the rest. It was posted by a user named Mr. Redhand:

“Stop playing with the other world, kid. Some things lie beyond human imagination. Your generation won’t believe it—but if you want to know the truth, visit Blackblood Lake near your city.”



Max blinked. The name. The wording. It felt… ancient. Not fake. Not part of a prank. It unsettled him—raised goosebumps on his neck. Yet that was exactly what pulled him in.

Curiosity won.

He packed lightly and left without telling his crew. No one knew where he’d gone.

He arrived at Blackblood Lake when night merged with silence. The sky hung low. The water flowed like blood—silent, deep, and impossibly black.

Max settled on the shore. He read about the lake’s cursed reputation: a portal to the other world. Rituals of black magic. Summoners lost to madness. Entities born from belief. So dangerous that the government had declared the lake forbidden decades ago.

Max chuckled.

“What could go wrong? It’s just a lake. The trap was set, I guess.”





 The Vanishing

Seven days passed.

A search team finally found Max near a jagged rock formation beside the lake. His clothes were torn. His skin bruised. His hands trembled like he was clutching invisible horrors.

But it was his eyes—plucked out cleanly, sockets hollow and scarred—that truly broke those who saw him.

He wasn’t screaming.

He wasn’t crying.

He was laughing. Manically.

Max spoke in fragments of unknown languages. Ancient dialects no one could decipher. Between his bouts of madness, he repeated the same line over and over:

“She is beautiful… hahahah… beautiful…”



And then, he began kissing the stone. Stroking it. Humping it like an animal possessed.

Doctors diagnosed him with severe dissociative psychosis. But the medications did nothing. Every midnight, Max’s laughter aligned perfectly with whispers no one else could hear. Surveillance footage recorded nothing. Yet his room temperature would plummet. Shadows moved without light. And Max began biting his own hands.



 The Lake Awakens

As the story spread, rumors reawakened Blackblood Lake’s legend.

Max’s YouTube channel—disabled and forgotten—suddenly began uploading again.

The videos were distorted. Static-filled. Glitched. One showed a red handprint smearing across the lens. Another showed Max—eyes intact, smiling strangely, blood on his chin—whispering:

“The lake remembers.”



The comment section grew corrupted. Cryptic symbols. Dozens of accounts posting the same phrase:

“She is watching.”



One of the usernames? Mr. Redhand.



 The Price of Belief

Visitors returned to the lake.

Some disappeared.

Some returned—changed. Silent. Pale. One girl was found drawing spirals on the wall of her room, mumbling “It’s coming through...” every time the wind stirred.

A priest attempted to seal the area with ancient rites. He vanished within forty-eight hours. All that remained was his Bible—its pages soaked, illustrations replaced by crude drawings of hollow eyes and an entity made of fingers.

A journalist traced Max’s lineage and found a half-burned journal in his home. The final page wasn’t written by him—or anyone modern. It simply read:

“The veil is thin. Belief fuels entry. She doesn’t need permission… only attention.”





 Truth… or Madness?

What happened to Max that night?

Was the lake a doorway? A punishment? A relic of something older than religion?

And who—or what—is Mr. Redhand?

Some say he isn’t real.

Others say he watches through cameras, living in your clicks. That every story told about him gives him shape.

But no one knows.

Max doesn't speak anymore.

Not during the day.

Only at midnight.

And if you slow down one of his corrupted videos… listen through the static…

You might hear it too.

I've tried to fill the gap with hobbies and some self-care, but there's still that empty kinda feeling sometimes.

Just wondering if anyone else feels this way or has felt like this before. How do you guys cope with it? Do you hunker down with a good book, take a walk in nature, or maybe just enjoy a fave tea? I always thought of myself as pretty independent, but I didn't realize how much those little social interactions mean to me until I started missing them.

Any comforting advice would be really appreciated. Maybe it's time for us to all remind each other that we're not as alone as we might feel sometimes. Thanks, everyone, for being a part of this space.😊",7,1752918888.0,TeaAndEmpathy,0,1.0,False

I begged over and over, but no one was listening","Please don't do this."" I begged over and over, but no one was listening. ""I am your luna."" I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me.

""Luke please."" I begged once more time, my voice horse.

""Take it once it's done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.""

He can't mean that. This was our baby.

""Is a mistake from the Moon Goddess. One I will rectify."" His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn't even face me. ""Now do it. That's a command.""

""Yes, Alpha.""

""Oh, and doctor?"" Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. ""Don't use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.""

""Yes, Luna."" The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was screwed.

I'm sorry, baby. Momma couldn't save you. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade.

""Silver?"" My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn't want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof.

I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us.

""Bring me the body of the pup.""

""Yes Alpha.""

I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak.

""Doctor, now.""

""Yes Alpha."" The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements.

I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place.

""I told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. "" Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. ""He is perfection. And don't worry. I will give him another son."" She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. ""What's so funny?""

""I can smell the beta on you. That's Derek's child, and it's a girl. Nice try though.""

She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again.

""You runt!"" He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room.

""Brandon!"" Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. ""What's wrong?"" She staggered to her feet, but more blood dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.

""You lied!"" He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver travelling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. ""This was my pup. I can smell me on him."" Brandon's eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. ""She did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.""

""You said you smelt it."" From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw. And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon.

She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls.

I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup.

""Save her.""

""No!"" Shannon screamed. ""I am the Luna now, you marked me last night."" Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night.

I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, hovering next to me. ""Stay with me Amy.""

""No!"" I slammed out, putting all of my power in it.

Brandon looked down at me, pleading. ""Let me save you.""

""I am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don't deserve to save me. You don't deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything."" I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body.

Chapter Two

I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive. ""Amy hurry, you're going to be late."" I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? ""Amy!"" The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom.

I hadn't stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother's arms. ""Mom, you're here."" I started to cry. ""I've missed you so much.""

""Amy. My girl."" She laughed as she patted my back. ""I saw you yesterday."" She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. ""Happy birthday, baby.""

I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. ""Thank you, mom.""

""Hopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life."" She smiled at me and I felt my blood freeze. I didn't want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.

""I'd rather stay here with you."" I smiled as I kissed her cheek. ""I don't want to miss you and Morgan.

And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he treated my baby and me like that. He also did the same to my mother for her involvement. Shannon's father, my mother's husband, watched her die.

""Baby. You won't miss us. We will be there every step of the way."" She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers.

""Mom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy's pack?"" My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn't a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk.

His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.

""No baby. I can't go back."" My mother's face fell as she turned away.

""I don't want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don't want a mate."" I whispered my new truth.

""What do you know?"" I watched as her eyes searched mine.

I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. ""I don't know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon's boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta."" I pulled back. ""I don't want this for me.""

She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. ""Okay baby. But you can't leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.""

I tossed my hands in the air. ""How would I do that?""

""There is much you don't know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure..."" She trailed off and I just nodded my head. ""Then let me make a few calls. You don't have to go to school today.""

I lept back into her arms. ""Thank you, mom. I don't know what I would do without you.""

""I love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you."" She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room.

I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.

I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open.

I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn't do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited.

""I'm telling you, if she is Brandon's mate, I'm going to destroy her.""

""You can't mean that, Shan."" The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon's best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.

""Of course I do. Brandon is mine.""

""Only because you put out. He was hoping Shannon would notice him.""

""You shut your mouth, Megan."" Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. ""He's mine.""

""Whatever I gotta go,"" Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand.

""What do you think you're doing in my closet?""

""Amy?"" Shannon's mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.

""You're lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to destroy me. Didn't I hear that correctly? A beta's daughter threatening an alpha."" I tsked.

""I didn't do anything."" She snarled back at me as her hand reformed.

""Lie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal."" I couldn't stop my grin as I felt her tremble. ""Did you threaten me?""

""Yes."" she screamed at me. ""You're going to take Brandon from me.""

""I don't want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him."" I pushed her away. ""Now get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you."" I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.

""What is your problem?""

""You. Now leave."" I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Foolish girl. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.

Chapter Three

""Pack your bags, Amy."" My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making.

""What?"" I looked up. ""Why?""

""You are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha."" Mom smiled down at me. ""Come on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.""

I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. ""I can go?""

""Just for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.""

I pouted. ""Mom, I really don't want to be here."" I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn't risk him finding me.

""It's okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad."" She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. ""Now get ready.""

""Okay mom."" I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open.

""I knew it."" I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.

""Shannon, why are you screaming?"" Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room.

""I'm not Brandon's mate, daddy."" Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms.

""How are you so sure?"" Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.

""It's you."" Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.

""Amy!"" Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked.

""Morgan, you can't yell ay Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first."" My mom placed my breakfast on the table. ""Amy, come eat. You have a long day ahead.""

""Babe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?""

""She is going away for the summer. To her fathers."" My mother turned to me and opened her arms. ""Come baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.""

I walked over and sat down, and dug in.

""Why is she going to her dads?"" Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up.

""She wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?"" My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn't know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it.

""Yeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven't seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom."" I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled.

""You're leaving?"" Shannon stood up.

""Yup. I'll be gone the full summer."" I smirked over at her. ""But my room is locked, and it will stay that way."" My smile dropped away as I stared at her and used my alpha command.

""Amy!"" Morgan yelled out. ""You know you're not allowed to alpha command your step sister!""

""And I wouldn't have Morgan, if I hdn't found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet."" I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie.

""Is that true?"" Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.

""I wouldn't lie. I'll just command you to tell the truth."" She screeched and stomped her foot.

""Yes!"" she screamed. ""Are you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon's mate.""

""How?"" I threw up my hands, playing like I didn't know the truth. ""How could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.""

""Because he scented you on me!"" Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.

""Calm down. You're hurting everyone's ears and just explain yourself."" My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.

""Last month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy's dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I'm not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me."" Shannon pouted.

""So he likes the way I smell, doesn't mean we are mates."" I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn't accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.

Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.

""Stop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell."" Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. ""He's the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her."" She pointed to me.

I scoffed. ""I don't want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon."" I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.

The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves.

The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It's said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs.

But either way, I wasn't lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon's vicinity.

""You're lying. He's the alpha.""

""And?""

""Everyone wants to be the luna.""

""Idiots want to be the luna."" I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.

""That's for you.""

I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.

Chapter Four

I slipped into the back of the car after putting my bags in the back and buckled in. I had barely takin a breath before I launched myself over the seats and into the driver's arms.

His laugh made my eyes prickle. ""Hey love bug.""

""Uncle Ronnie. I've missed you."" I climbed over the seats and sat up front. ""What are you doing here?"" Ronnie was my dad's beta. Not related, but he had been there for most of my life.

""You think I was going to let my cheeky niece come to pack lands alone? Not on your life.""

""Dad sent you?"" I laughed.

""Dad sent me. He is a worry wart your da."" He smiled over and laughed with me. ""As soon as your mom called, he sent me with the jet.""

""He didn't have to."" I just shook my head and buckled my seatbelt.

""Of course he did. He never gets to see you enough, and now you're sending in the summer. What's going on?"" My uncle looked at me and I just shook my head.

""I don't want to be here.""

""Why?""

I looked down at my hands that were twisted. ""I'm afraid that my mate is here and I don't want to be right. I figured if I ran away, I could push off the inevitability.""

""Why wouldn; t you want your mate?"" My uncle asked as he zipped down the highway toward the airport.

""I'll tell both you and dad, just not now."" My uncle looked over at me, searching my face and then nodding.

""Fine, but I want the full story.""

""You will get it, I swear."" I nodded back to the road. ""Now focus on driving so you don't ruin us."" I grabbed the wheel, swerving back into our own lane.

""Heck!"" Uncle Ronnie grabbed the wheel from me and focused back on the road. ""I just worry about you, pup."" I couldn't stop the laugh because wolves stopped aging at twenty-five, and he looked barely older than me.

""I know you do."" I settled back into my seat and sighed. ""I promise, what happened isn't going to make that feeling any better."" I wiped at my face. ""I don't even know why my mom is sending me to my dad. She just said that he could help me.""

""Well, let's hurry and get back so we can figure out what you need, Sugar."" My uncle hit the gas, and we ended up at the airport in no time.

We loaded my bags and headed up to the jet, settling in there. ""Close your eyes. You look like you barely slept today and we have a few hours."" My uncle patted my head before he sat across from me and opened his laptop.

""Work?""

""Work."" He nodded.

""This summer, can you teach me some stuff?"" A plan was forming in my mind, a plan not only to keep myself away from my pathetic mate, but one that would make me a lot of money.

""Of course, Sugar."" My uncle smiled up at me. ""You know, your dad would teach you just about everything he could if you were open to it.""

""I asked to move to your pack."" I snuggled into the blanket the flight attendant handed me, and Ronnie froze.

""What is going on?"" His eyes flashed.

""I'll explain later. Just promise you will try to believe me and not judge me.""

""Of course, Sugar."" He smiled and then turned back to the laptop on his lap. ""Now get some sleep.""

""Will do."" I turned away and fell asleep almost instantly.

I woke up to Ronnie shaking me. ""We are here.""

I gave an enormous yawn and cracked my jaw before wiping my eyes. ""Okay."" I handed off the blanket and wiped my face again. ""Thank you.""

""No problem, Princess."" The flight attendant smiled down at me, and I realized belatedly that she was from the pack too.

""You don't have to call me Princess.""

""You are the Alpha's daughter."" She bowed and then left us to our own devices.

""Come on, your dad has already linked me three times since landing."" Ronnie laughed and whisked me off to the waiting car. With in thirty minutes we were at our pack lands. ""You dad would allow you to move here if you wanted to, Sugar.""

""I know. But Alpha Dan won't allow me to leave..."" I looked over and blew out a breath. ""I think he assumes something I am running from and won't let me leave until he knows for sure.""

""You going to tell me yet, Sugar.""

I hesitated as we pulled up out front of the pack house. Before I could answer the door was ripped open and I was surrounded by powerful arms and a smell that made my quaking insides settle.

""Dad.""

""Hey my pup."" His deep voice calmed me further, and I could feel my eyes prickle.

""I've missed you."" I sniffled as he unbuckled my seat belt and I was in his arms fully.

""As I have missed you."" He kissed my temple. ""Now we have much to discuss."" He was running with me before I could utter another word, with Ronnie following behind.

""Slow down, jack ass. Some of us can't move that fast."" Ronnie struggled to keep up and my laughter filled the halls of the pack house. We settled in my father's office with an out of breath Ronnie, who was scowling. God, I missed these two.

""Tell me what's wrong, pup."" I looked around and still I stumbled over my words. My father grabbed my face and shook his head. ""Nothing you tell me will change anything, pup. I believe you, no matter how crazy it seems.""

""Agreed Sugar.""

My insides settled when I saw how resolute he was. He would believe my craziness. I could tell no matter how crazy my story was, my father and Ronnie would believe everything I said.

I never had to second guess if I was going crazy here.

So finally I settled fully and told my story.

Chapter Five

""I lived another life, and I died."" I stumbled over my words and I felt my father freeze. A quick look to Ronnie had him locking the door and waving his hands. I felt the air still, but I was focused on my father's eyes. ""This morning I woke up six years in the past after living until I was twenty-four, and growing my own pup only to have my mate to rip him from my body.""

My father's and Ronnie's snarl shook the walls, but I raised my hands. ""He betrays me for my step sister who convinced him that I cheated and the pup wasn't his, so he brought death to us both using silver scalpels, and burying any love I had for him at the same time."" I looked up at my father and the tears rolled down my face.

""Pup."" His voice was choked up, but I raised my hand.

""I don't want him to be my mate, daddy. I know I won't survive it. I need to change it. Everything, and it starts with hiding my scent. I told mom what I needed, and she called you. How are you going to help me?"" I was starting to panic. ""I don't want to die. I don't want my pup ripped from my stomach only for him to smell himself on him. I don't want to create life just to have it ripped from me daddy. I can't."" My soul was ripping and even though I want revenge, this was the first time I was given to truly grieve the lost of my pup.

""Sugar."" Ronnie's voice was barely a whisper and then I felt my father lose control.

""Who?"" His voice was pure darkness. His fist slammed into the desk, creaking the thick wood, and I looked up to find my father's wolf looking back at me. ""Who hurt you, my pup? Who did those my grand pup?"" Loki's voice was deeper than I had ever heard and his eyes promised retribution.

""Brandon, the alpha's son."" I whispered the final piece and everything seemed to click. The air rushed back in and my father's wolf shifted into his black form. I screamed and Ronnie dove in front of the door.

Loki snarled, but Ronnie held firm. ""You can't go for him for something that hasn't come to pass yet, Loki. You know how this works. You have been through it yourself."" But Loki just snarled.

""Daddy, please."" I begged. I knew if he got out, Brandon and Shannon were dead and the council would be on his doorstop. Loki whirled on me and softened at the devastation he saw on my face. He padded over and licked the tears from my face before going back behind the desk and shifting again.

""I'm sorry Amy, I lost myself for a moment."" He opened a door and slipped into some shorts. He wiped at his face before he sat back down. ""I guess its our turn to come clean.""

""Daddy?"" I sniffled and looked up at him.

""I'm not just a wolf, although, as you can see, Loki is very much a part of me."" His laughter was weak, but I just smiled. ""My mother was a shaman of our people, a witch, and my father had to have her. Even if it was just for a night. And I was born.""

""A witch?"" I dropped my hands, and he just had a small, sad smile.

""Yeah. You would have loved her, but witches don't live like us. They have the lifespan of a human, a flash in the pan. She was gone long before I met your mother."" He shook his head. ""One of her powers was exactly what you explained, a second chance. The moon goddess passed us down with the same powers. I had mine when I was your age as well.""

I jolted back as he nodded. ""What?""

""I never cheated on your mother."" His words were soft. ""I alpha commanded a wolf to pretend I did when she came to me and told me she was with pup. You see, in my first life, I stayed with her and we had three wonderful pups, but one night, my enemies attacked and the four of your were all murdered."" His swallow was thick.

""Daddy.""

""I couldn't lose you, not all of my pups, so when I woke up four years in the past, I acted. You were just a babe. I never got your brothers or sister, which broke me for a time. But I had you."" He swallowed back his tears as I reached his side. ""I told your mother I betrayed her.""

""She said she felt it.""

He nodded slowly. ""When a wolf betrays their marked mate, the mate feels the worse pain imaginable.""

""Yes, he does."" Ronnie growled out and I darted my eyes back to his face and I realized something.

""Mom and Morgan.""

""It doesn't happen often enough to make it a big."" My dad growled out.

""But it happens enough that you feel the pain."" Ronnie growled out.

""Mom doesn't know."" I wrapped my arms around my father. ""She wouldn't ever if she knew.""

""I know, princess, but you can't tell her. I'm sure I passed the fate, since I made it past my death...but now, now it would break her to find out the truth."" My dad squeezed me.

""So she felt you take another female?"" I hugged him back, but he just shook his head.

""I used my power to fake the pain. She was crying inside of our room, and I was in the next room, breaking my own heart.""

""Daddy?""

""It was losing her and you, or losing everything. And I knew I would still get to see my little girl."" My dad pulled back. ""But anyway, I didn't tell you so you would feel bad for me, but to know that you have power too. Power to hide your scent, at the very least. But I will teach you how to wield it this summer.""

""Thank you, dad.""

(Now She’s My GF!)","Alright, Reddit, I’ve got a wild high school revenge story from five years ago that I need to share. Buckle up—it’s got betrayal, a toad, and a plot twist nobody saw coming.

So, back in junior year at my high school, I was a quiet kid just trying to survive. I had a small friend group, including three girls—let’s call them Lisa, Emma, and Sarah. I thought they were cool, until they stabbed me in the back over a    sandwich . Yup, you read that right. I was sneaking a bite in the library , and Lisa caught me. Instead of covering for me, she smirked and said, “Oh, you’re screwed now.” Next thing I know, she’s dragging Emma and Sarah to the principal’s office, snitching like it’s their job. They spun it like I was smuggling contraband or something. Principal Jenkins, who had zero chill, slapped me with a week’s suspension. My parents were pissed, and I was humiliated.

As I left school that day, I heard them laughing their heads off in the courtyard. Lisa was the worst, mimicking my face when I got called to the office. Emma and Sarah were cackling too. I was  livid . Suspension gave me a week to stew, and I decided Lisa, the ringleader, was getting payback.

Enter my genius (if I do say so myself) revenge plan. Lisa was obsessed with her fancy pink designer backpack, always showing it off. I knew she’d lose it over anything gross, so I recruited a partner: a warty little toad from the creek behind my house. I named him Sir Hoppity, my MVP. Harmless, but guaranteed to freak her out.

The day I got back from suspension, I waited for gym class when everyone’s bags were in the locker room. Lisa’s bag was easy to spot—glittery monogram and all. I slipped Sir Hoppity into the front pocket, made sure he was comfy, and hid nearby, “tying my shoe.” After class, Lisa grabs her bag, unzips the pocket to get her phone, and—BOOM—Sir Hoppity launches out, landing on her chest before hopping onto her shoulder. She  screamed like she was in a horror flick. “IT’S A FROG!” she wailed, flailing like it was a tarantula. Emma and Sarah screamed too, jumping on a bench. The whole locker room lost it laughing. Lisa was crying, red-faced, swatting at her shirt like the toad was still there. Coach Thompson had to chase down Sir Hoppity while Lisa had a full meltdown.

I slipped away, unnoticed. Sir Hoppity was safely returned to his creek, a true legend. Lisa? She earned the nickname “Toad Girl” for the rest of the year. Kids would rib her about it constantly, and she’d blush and change the subject. Revenge tasted  so sweet.

Now, here’s the twist. Flash forward to now—I’m in my senior year of college, and  Lisa’s my girlfriend .  Yup, you read that right. At our high school reunion last year, we got to talking, and she brought up the toad prank, laughing her head off about how she overreacted. She admitted the snitching was a dumb power trip and apologized. Turns out, she thought my prank was kinda clever . We grabbed coffee, hit it off, and now we’re dating. She still checks her bag for “surprise toads” when I’m around, lol.",1,1752918802.0,MarkNarrations,0,1.0,False
1m3senb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1m3senb/the_day_i_accidentally_stole_a_dog_and_found_my/,The day I accidentally stole a dog and found my confidence,"Last year, while recovering from my third UPSC attempt (yeah, I was that guy in full isolation mode), I decided to step outside and touch some grass — literally.

I started going to a nearby park to read and clear my head. One day, while sipping cheap coffee and pretending to read Sapiens, a golden retriever ran up and dropped a stick at my feet. Naturally, I threw it. He brought it back. We bonded. For 30 minutes, it was magic.

Then a woman jogged over and yelled, “Hey! That’s not your dog!”
Long story short, I had accidentally walked halfway across the park with someone else's retriever. I apologized, half-laughing, half-dying inside.

But here’s the twist — the jogger laughed with me, not at me. We chatted. She said I looked like I needed a dog more than she did. I didn’t get her number, but I did walk home feeling something I hadn’t felt in months: alive.

That moment pushed me out of isolation. I started smiling at strangers. Joined a book club. Stopped overthinking. Life didn't become perfect, but it became possible again.

1m3sdca,https://www.reddit.com/r/cdifficile/comments/1m3sdca/c_diff_5_12_years/,C Diff: 5 1/2 Years,"I had C diff for 5 1/2 years . I was in high school. A couple months after getting my wisdom teeth removed I remember using the bathroom the entire class period. (TMI ) but nonstop it was constant . My stomach hurt & I couldn’t control it. After that I went to the doctor. They sent me to the gi dr & the Dr said everything looked normal. After that I started experiencing brain fog. I also have Bipolar 1 simultaneously ( it started around the time I was having C diff symptoms. ) I was a teenager at the time . I started experiencing brain fog, ringing in my ears really loudly like a very high pitch at random times, I got tmj, cavities all of a sudden, & of course constant stomach pain & diarrhea as well as constipation. Warm & cold numbness in my feet & hands . Random facial numbness & Difficulty swallowing , throwing up stomach acid & id get extreme issues w my visions. I’d see dots everywhere & they’d get blurry. I also got tinnitus & it felt like bugs were crawling on me, also the most insane muscle soreness , like muscle soreness to the bones it felt like it was in my bones. Also obvious infection feelings like sweats & feelings weirdly cold & hot, neasuous. Basically Lyme disease symptoms.I was experiencing these symptoms & told my dr “ I am Suffering .” Yet the c diff wasn’t found . Little did I know I’d have to go through 4 more years of this torture. Everyday was like dragging myself through a suffering pit of fire & putting on a performance. I was So brain fogged up that my memory was short. I experienced things like facial swelling , acne , redness & hives all over my body. I developed multiple food allergies pretty quickly . I was at the time , going to track practice, getting home & running a mile & then going to the gym. But 1 day it started getting difficult for me to breathe & I remember my hands being slightly blue from how little I could breathe , after a run. I couldn’t workout anymore , i tried & tried. My coordination also just started being so off . I literally would run & fall constantly , but that never happened before. I remember I fell 2 times in a race, & then couldn’t breathe so much, that i had to run off midway through the race . & i quit track .So after high school it was time for college. I was so sick but I was still going . I quit drinking alcohol & smoking weed, because I physically would react to either. My gut couldn’t tolerate them & I’d get exreme brain fog. I just remember thinking everyday “ when will they find what’s wrong” I then began pushing for tests , I Got multiple tests done. Every 1 you can think of. Except the 1 I apparently needed. Payed for every appointment for every dr . They all said nothing. I quit college because I started to be unable to walk to the cafeteria . It gets difficult to feel my legs ,all the time & my tinnitus was constant. I literally couldn’t walk because i was so sick. Eventually we get into year 2 & 3 . I’m Crying & Sobbing everyday Like scream crying in my room all day begging for answers . I start not being able to sleep . I mean extreme . I’d hyperventilate constantly because my body was so stressed, it was so hard to breathe in my stomach & with the stomach acid coming up as well. I couldn’t breathe. I’d hyperventilate so strong so heavily that i actually Fractured 2 of my ribs. I actually fractured 2 of my ribs. & I was not sleeping at all. I Genuinely do not think I slept for a whole Year, genuinely . I’m not joking I literally was not sleeping. I went to the hospital for it . & all they said was “ You’ll sleep eventually “ this system is BS. How could you not have found an infection in me for years ? A psychiatrist wasn’t even recommended. My body was just overwhelmed with this evil being living in me, taking over everything . Taking over my happiness taking over everything. I’m not the same as I was , I wasn’t myself . I’ve been so sick for so long I’ve forgotten who I am . I got gross Feelings , Gross thoughts I didn’t want , extreme OCD . I’d just cry all day. I just feel Evil, like something isn’t right. Along w the lack of sleep. I genuinely can’t stress how much this completely required my brain & Body. I dnt understand how I lived through that genuinely. So 1 day I’m yelling down the stairs to tell my mom something , & I Physically am slurring my speech. This has never happened to me in my life. Like imagine you’re talking & you’re physically slurring your speech even though you’re saying exactly what you want. It’s Terrifying. Imagine having no idea what’s wrong as well. I thought I might have a brain tumour, cancer , everything under the book. I researched myself, because no Dr was doing it for me. So then I started getting bigger procedures. I got MRI’s of my brain & spine , Ct scans of my whole body. I got my spine tapped. & nothing . I had a journal with procedures I was getting done. Every single day of the month was basically booked. I counted down every day , I suffered every fucking day, I cried all alone everyday. No one believed me except the person I was dating. There was 1 week when I called them every night at 4am in the morning so they could take me to the hospital, because I was so sick. The only thing they’d find every time was extremely low potassium levels & magnesium as well as sum other vitamins. I wasn’t absorbing any nutrient. & I remember the 1st time I was injected w potassium. I was screaming at the top of my lungs, because I was a Zombie . So out of it & confused, & my whole body was burning. The nurses looked at me as if I’m insane . I never Gave up, Ever. I Fought the entire time. Well eventually I was tired , as I was the entire time of fighting this. & I wasn’t sleeping for weeks on end ( yep I’m 100% sure ) & I tried my best to sleep but couldn’t. Tbh idk why I guess it’s mania that the C diff flared up or caused. Also the hyperventilating & C diff causes high heart rate. I tried everything. Natural sleeping pills like every thing you can buy at Cvs. I didn’t know much more. So 1 night I just tried hanging myself (I did it wrong)& after that I just took an insane amount of melatonin & z quill pills & drank an entire bottle of z quill. Like it was a lot . My intentions were tu kill myself or sleep. & neither happened so. After that I think I gave up the dr’s couldn’t do anything. I changed my diet multiple times & eventually I gave up gluten . This completely changed everything. My symptoms got so much clearer . Everything was good for a while. Until I’d eat sugar sometimes & notice feeling weird after. & I was like hmm thts strange. I also would get reoccurrent vaginal infections , even though I wasn’t sexually active much, cleaning myself & eating ok. That’s what happens though because my gut microbiome was so bad. & Guess wht, Everytime I got an infection I took more antibiotics.. which drastically worsens the infection. I literally went through 4 rounds of antibiotics. Wtf. This is an infection festering in me & getting worse for 5 years btw… idk how tf I Survived that genuinely. Eventually the sleep was never fixed so I went to the Psychiatrist. I Went to 3 different 1’s because i didn’t believe them. They all said I’m Bipolar. I’m like ok just give me my pills . After that I was taking Seroquel. It’s extremely strong. Would knock me out. But also messed with my heart beats. The medicine turned me even more into a zombie ( like extreme) & I needed iced coffee every morning just to get through the day. Caffeine is super bad for C diff . So it was not great . & I remember 1 night id always eat before bed, my heart rate was super high. I knew something was wrong. I went to the hospital. 180 Heart rate . Next day, same thing. It was so scary I just was so petrified & sad. Alone also this entire thing. I also had my family telling me I was making shit up this entire time. But I remember when it was at its worst It felt like literally nails clawing in my stomach constantly & like a literal heaviness over my entire intestines up over my heart. I can’t explain it . Like I literally had no room to breathe in my own body. Imagine the sensation of literal nails clawing inside ur stomach thts wht it felt like. I remember thinking everyday “ I can’t wait til they find out what it is “ & the day never came. I couldn’t believe it every year. I remember coming home & falling to the floor & crying to my mom “ I don’t wanna eat anymore “ I knew . Anyways, I Booked & called my dr & told her “something’s fucking wrong I Need every Test done now. I know it’s my stomach” & Welp C diff came back. At the time I literally remember thinking like wow , that was not what I was looking for. I thought C diff was something minor. It’s So Extreme. It kills people . Idk How I Survived that . (Also my poop was yellow since that started in high school so yes I have had it the entire time) Moral of the story I have to be vegan because my body can’t operate without eating that way. I also can barely eat, The Less I eat the better. The less I eat the better I can think . I’m Still not enjoying life. Because I Gave up so long ago. Every let down, every time I was told nothing was wrong with me, I knew my Body wasn’t going to last, I knew it was dying , so I Came to terms with tht. 100% came to terms with it. & now I’m supposed to just move forward.. when everyday I still feel the symptoms. It takes people years to Heal. It takes life from so many people , it took my college years from me , it took my high school years from me. I just hope I’ll heal. I started Vancomycin after they found it. I couldn’t even eat a banana. I starved for I think 4 days straight.. idk how long the vanco treatment was. Id tremble everyday I was so sick. Im still unable to sleep for more than a day a week , im on lithium now. So ya im pretty unsure where to go from here but , at least i found C diff , Fuck tht. ",1,1752918647.0,cdifficile,0,1.0,False

""Get the OR ready. Remove her womb. Make sure it’s done before she wakes.""

The pack healer went rigid with shock.

""Alpha... Remove her womb?!""

""Alpha—you don't have an heir! You do this, the pack will have no heir. The pack elders will never accept it!""

Cassian's voice was ice-cold, devoid of emotion.

""I don’t need an heir from Evelyn Carter. Annabelle delivered my heir yesterday. He will inherit everything. Evelyn’s womb is a threat.""

The healer's face crumpled with disbelief.

""But that boy will carry another man's name, call another man Alpha. After seven miscarriages, The chances of Luna carrying another are barely there.""

Cassian lit a cigarette, his voice bitter.

""Annabelle is my true mate, I’d do anything for her, I don't care some Moon Goddess pairing.""

""Alpha, but—""

""Enough."" He frowned. ""Do it.""

Just as Cassian got up to go, his phone buzzed. He hit speaker by mistake.

""Alpha, got the cash. Hell, after seven jobs, I could do this shit in my sleep. Next time, I’ll wear a vampire disguise—really carve up that Luna's belly—""

""No next time. Take your money and disappear from Moonvale.""

Footsteps approached from deeper inside.

I stumbled back to my room, barely making it to the bed before Cassian entered.

""Evelyn, you're up. When did you wake up?""

Sweat beaded on my forehead as I fought to appear normal.

""Just woke up. You weren't here, so I thought I'd stretch my legs.""

His eyes narrowed slightly, studying my face.

My wolf whimpered with terror. Just when I thought he'd caught me, he scooped me up and settled me back on the bed.

""Baby, you scared the hell out of me. We already lost our pup—I can't handle losing you too.""

He dared to mention our pup.

Thinking of all the puppies he'd murdered, I pressed a hand to my chest as grief threatened to overwhelm me.

Those accidents, the attacks, the fall—all of it orchestrated by my own mate.

""The heal needs to do a follow-up procedure. Just to make sure everything's healing properly.""

""I know losing the baby hurts, but we'll try again. We'll have the most beautiful pup—strong like their Alpha, gentle like their mother.""

Cassian handed me a vial of potion. In the brief moment he turned away, I saw a thick, dark liquid shimmer as something else mixed in and vanished.

He pulled me close, his expression soft with false concern.

But I could see through the mask now. Every gentle touch was a lie.

""Do I really need to drink this? I'm not very thirsty...""

Cassian, you've slaughtered seven of my children. Now you want to steal my very ability to be a mother?

He didn't even pause, stroking my hair with that practiced tenderness.

""Come on, don't be difficult. You need your strength to heal. You want your Alpha to worry himself sick?""

""Let me help you with that.""

He pressed the glass to my lips, his grip firm enough that refusal wasn't an option.

I closed my eyes, each swallow feeling like liquid fire burning down my throat.

As the drugs took hold, I saw the healer slip into the room through my blurring vision.

""Begin immediately. And...""

Cassian's voice dropped to barely a whisper.

""Make sure she can’t walk again.""

Chapter 2

""Alpha, is this really necessary? Isn’t that… a little too cruel?""

""Do it!""

I knew Cassian was always calculating and paranoid, but I never imagined that just seeing me awake early would push him to such cruelty.

My puppy, my chance at motherhood, and now even my ability to walk—he was taking everything.

Cassian, is this how you treat the mate the Moon Goddess chose for you?

My wolf howled inside me, wild and silent with fury.

I screamed silently in despair, struggling to sit up, but the darkness pulled me deeper.

As the anesthesia began to wear off, I heard the healer's voice through the haze:

""Alpha, her womb has been removed. And... she'll never walk again.""

Cassian's voice was filled with satisfaction. ""Good. Perfect.""

When I fully awakened, tears were falling onto my hands—his tears, so convincingly real.

""Evelyn, the healer says infection damaged your womb. You'll never be able to have children.""

I ignored him, frantically trying to move my legs.

Nothing. No sensation at all.

I broke down completely, sobbing as I demanded:

""Cassian, what did you do to my legs?""

Tears streamed down his face, his voice breaking with practiced grief.

""There were complications with the anesthesia. You're paralyzed from the waist down.""

""Don't be scared, baby... no matter what happens, I'll never leave you. I'll always love you.""

I'd never realized what a gifted actor my mate was.

He dismissed the nurses, personally feeding me soup, cleaning my body, even tending to the post-surgical bleeding himself.

He worked tirelessly until evening, then kissed my forehead tenderly.

""You've suffered so much for our pack. I promise I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.""

I studied his exhausted face, then looked away coldly.

""You should rest if you're tired.""

""I'll stay right here with you. Just call if you need anything.""

Once he was asleep, I reached for his second phone.

I'd always known about Cassian's other device—his ""work phone""—but had never thought to check it.

The password worked on the first try.

Annabelle's birthday.

The lock screen showed their wedding photo.

A wedding photo... He'd married her in secret. The white dress seared my eyes.

With trembling fingers, I opened his messages. He called her ""baby"" in every text.

Endless conversations that grew more horrifying with each scroll.

Every business trip had been a lie—excuses to be with her.

All those times I'd been hurt that he never came to my doctor appointments.

When physicians asked about the Alpha, I'd smile awkwardly and say he was busy with Alpha duties.

His standard response was always the same:

""I’ve been tied up with pack affairs. Check-ups aren't a big deal—I'd just be in the way. You can handle routine things yourself.""

But he'd attended every single one of Annabelle's prenatal appointments. No matter how busy, he never missed one.

He wrote about how excited he was for their child, calling them the most precious thing in his world.

Scrolling further, my heart shattered completely.

Every time I got pregnant, they planned how to kill my child.

Even the car accident from a year ago—Annabelle had been behind the wheel.

She'd said she wanted to experience the thrill of hitting someone. Cassian had eagerly agreed.

His only instruction: ""Try not to kill her outright.""

They discussed hurting me and murdering my children as casually as commenting on the weather.

My nails dug into my palms until blood dripped between my fingers.

The photo album contained thousands of pictures—all of Annabelle. Candid shots, selfies together, morning scenes, walks, intimate dinners where he'd prepared special meals for her pregnancy...

There were 99+ videos. I switched to that section and felt ice water flood my veins.

Countless recordings of their intimate moments, like they were documenting every encounter.

Even role-playing scenarios that made my stomach turn.

I pressed my hand to my mouth, fighting nausea.

But worse were six videos labeled ""First,"" ""Second,"" all the way to ""Sixth.""

Realizing what they contained, bile rose in my throat as blood filled my mouth.

Chapter 3

I bit down hard on my lip and opened the sixth video.

Cassian and Annabelle were laughing together.

In front of them lay...my unboren puppy.

The blade might as well have been cutting into my own flesh. My wolf howled in agony, the pain causing my stomach to cramp violently.

I couldn't hold back anymore, leaning over the bed rail as dry heaves wracked my body.

I didn't sleep that night, my wolf pacing restlessly in my mind as tears soaked through my hospital gown.

The next morning, Cassian brought me breakfast as usual—an elaborate spread he'd personally selected.

Pancakes, fresh fruit, coffee, pastries...

I'd once thought this was his way of showing love. Now I knew it was just thoughtless guilt, buying his way out of actually caring.

Remembering the videos, I dry heaved again.

Seeing my distress, Cassian's expression filled with concern:

""Still feeling sick? Damn it, this is all my fault. I hate seeing my mate like this.""

""I'm fine. I want to go home.""

Something flickered across Cassian's face—a moment of tension.

""You just lost another pup. My mother isn't... handling it well. If you go back to the pack house now, you'll just walk into a shitstorm. Maybe we should wait until things cool down.""

I said nothing, but his expression told me everything I needed to know.

That afternoon, while he was gone, I packed my things and wheeled myself to the pack house.

I rolled through the front door to find Annabelle curled up in Cassian's lap, both of them cooing over a baby whose scent carried unmistakable traces of Graves bloodline.

Margaret emerged from the kitchen with a bowl of bone broth, personally feeding Annabelle spoonful by spoonful.

The three of them looked like the perfect family unit.

The moment Margaret caught my scent, her eyes flashed with her wolf's displeasure.

""Well, well. Look what crawled back to the den. You've got some nerve showing your face here after what you've done.""

""My Alpha son treats you like a precious mate, and this is how you repay him? Another dead heir. You're cursed, and you're bringing that curse into our pack!""

""Annabelle is the one deserves to be Luna of the Moonvale Pack. Get out of my territory—you're poison to this pack.""

Annabelle followed Margaret's gaze to me, her eyes glittering with the triumph:

""Luna Margaret, don't be so harsh. What if Evelyn gets upset and starts spreading lies about Alpha and me to the other packs?""

""Let her try. No pack leader gives a damn what a barren she-wolf has to say.""

I knew Margaret had always despised me. She thought I was too headstrong for an Alpha's mate, too independent—that I'd challenge her son's authority instead of submitting properly.

Annabelle was everything she wanted: beautiful, submissive, making Cassian the center of her universe like a proper Luna should.

She'd only wanted Annabelle as her son's mate, but then Annabelle married into another pack, and I'd given up everything to be the perfect Alpha's mate.

Margaret had reluctantly accepted me into the pack.

But years of failed pregnancies had pushed her resentment to the breaking point.

Now that Annabelle was back—with Cassian's heir—Margaret felt free to unleash every bit of venom she'd been storing.

If only she knew that every one of those lost pups had been orchestrated by her beloved Alpha.

Every grandchild she'd mourned had been murdered by the woman she was now treating like precious pack treasure.

In the past, Cassian would have used his Alpha command to intervene. Now he sat there holding Annabelle's child, acting like he couldn't hear a word.

Annabelle nestled deeper into his arms:

""Cassian, you're paying more attention to the pup than to me. Your wolf is making mine jealous.""

Cassian's expression melted with adoration as he nuzzled her neck, scenting her:

""You know you're my true mate. But look what I have for you.""

I followed Annabelle's delighted gaze to a document on the coffee table: ""Pack Territory Transfer Agreement.""

""Oh my God, Cassian! You're giving me pack lands?""

She kissed the corner of his mouth, shooting me a triumphant look over his shoulder.

I smiled back coldly, my wolf finally going still in my mind.

Enjoy it while you can.

1m3scev,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1m3scev/the_day_i_accidentally_stole_a_dog_and_found_my/,The day I accidentally stole a dog and found my confidence,"Last year, while recovering from my third UPSC attempt (yeah, I was that guy in full isolation mode), I decided to step outside and touch some grass — literally.

I started going to a nearby park to read and clear my head. One day, while sipping cheap coffee and pretending to read Sapiens, a golden retriever ran up and dropped a stick at my feet. Naturally, I threw it. He brought it back. We bonded. For 30 minutes, it was magic.

Then a woman jogged over and yelled, “Hey! That’s not your dog!”
Long story short, I had accidentally walked halfway across the park with someone else's retriever. I apologized, half-laughing, half-dying inside.

But here’s the twist — the jogger laughed with me, not at me. We chatted. She said I looked like I needed a dog more than she did. I didn’t get her number, but I did walk home feeling something I hadn’t felt in months: alive.

That moment pushed me out of isolation. I started smiling at strangers. Joined a book club. Stopped overthinking. Life didn't become perfect, but it became possible again.

I screamed as my pup was brutally ripped from my belly by my Alpha mate, who believed my stepsister's lie about my betrayal.  
I died in hatred, but when I woke, I was reborn.  
Laughing through tears, I swore, ""You two will pay for your sins!""  
I am descended from the Moon Goddess, but in my past life, my Alpha mate believed my stepsister's lies about my betrayal and killed our unborn child and me.  
In this life, he still longs for me, but I slammed the door in his face, “Go away! I’ve got the Lycan King in my bed now!”  
\*\*  
“Please don’t do this.” I begged over and over, but no one was listening. I thrashed against their hold, but nothing.  
“I am your luna.” I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me. “Luke please.” I begged once more time, my voice horse.  
“Kill it once it’s done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.”  
He can’t mean that. This was our baby. “Our baby.”  
“Is a mistake from the moon goddess. One I will rectify.” His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn’t even face me.  
“Now do it. That’s an order.”  
“Yes, Alpha.”  
It was a mistake to come here.  
It was a mistake to give him everything.  
“Oh, and doctor?” Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. “Don’t use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.”  
“Yes, Luna.” The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was in trouble.  
I’m sorry, baby. Momma couldn’t save you. She wanted you so, so much. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade.  
“Silver?” My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn’t want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof. But I never touched another wolf, nor would I again, not after this betrayal.  
Why, Moon Goddess, why would you give him to me just to take him away? My pup.  
I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us.  
“Bring me the body of the pup.”  
“Yes Alpha.” I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I started to scream, soon I felt the blvvd trickling down my side, every drip off of me hitting the floor. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak.  
I’m sorry, baby.  
They weren’t trying to keep me alive, which I expected, but I wished wasn’t true. I used to love my mate, but I felt the love die in me when I saw my pup being ripped from my belly.  
“Please, let me hold him once.” I tried to move my arms to reach for him, but I was still tied down. The doctor, who was shedding tears, brought my pup and laid him on my chest.  
He was perfect. I rubbed his scent on my face and mine on his. He would forever be a part of my soul.  
My missing piece.  
“Doctor, now.”  
“Yes Alpha.” The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements.  
I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place.  
“I told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. And I have, over and over, since he found out of your betrayal.”  
Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. “He is perfection. And don’t worry. I will give him another son.” She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. “What’s so funny?”  
“I can smell the beta on you. That’s Derek’s child, and it’s a girl. Nice try though.”  
She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again.  
“You s1vt!” He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room.  
“Brandon!” Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. “What’s wrong?” She staggered to her feet, but more blvvd dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.  
“You lied!” He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver traveling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. “This was my pup. I can smell me on him. He was mine.” Brandon’s eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. “You said she cheated on me and that it wasn’t my pup.”  
“She did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.”  
“You said you smelt it.” From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw.  
And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon.  
She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls.  
I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup.  
“Save her.”  
“No!” Shannon screamed. “I am the Luna now, you marked me last night.” Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night. His betrayal had bile shoot into my mouth. “I am bearing your pup.”  
I started to laugh again. I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, lingering next to me. “Stay with me Amy.”  
“Beta’s baby. She is with…the beta.” I choked out the words and laughed as horror bloomed in his eyes. Blvvd flew from my mouth as I smiled again.  
“Save her.”  
“No!” I slammed out, putting all of my power in it. “Don’t move.” I used my Alpha strength to freeze everyone, including my mate.  
“How?” Brandon looked down at me, pleading. “Let me save you.”  
“I am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don’t deserve to save me. You don’t deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything.” I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body.  
And then I was free.  
I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive.  
“Amy hurry, you’re going to be late.” I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? “Amy!” The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom.  
I hadn’t stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother’s arms. “Mom, you’re here.” I started to cry. “I’ve missed you so much.”  
“Amy. My girl.” She laughed as she patted my back. “I saw you yesterday.” She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. “Happy birthday, baby.”  
I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. “Thank you, mom.”  
“Hopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life.” She smiled at me and I felt my blvvd freeze. I didn’t want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.  
“I’d rather stay here with you.” I smiled as I kissed her cheek. “I don’t want to miss you and Morgan.  
And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he killed my baby and me. He killed my mother for her involvement. Shannon’s father, my mother’s husband, watched her die. Don’t get me wrong I knew he loved my mother, and he was hurting, but his scheming daughter was the cause of all of this. He stood by and watched it all happen.  
I understood why he supported his daughter, but I didn’t like it, nor him, for that matter.  
“Baby. You won’t miss us. We will be there every step of the way.” She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers.  
“Mom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy’s pack?”  
My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn’t a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk. But he swore it was a mistake. It was another Alpha’s maneuverings to break them up, but my mother said it didn’t matter. It was too late.  
His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.  
“No baby. I can’t go back.” My mother’s face fell as she turned away.  
“I don’t want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don’t want a mate.” I whispered my new truth.  
“Mates don’t hurt each other, baby.” She tried to smile but I shook. I knew exactly what mates do to each other.  
“Would you be made if I refused my mate?”  
“God no baby. The Moon Goddess makes a path clear, but it is up to us to choose it. If you don’t want your mate, you can reject him.”  
“And if it is the Alpha’s son?”  
My mother looked at me. She knew that if it was the Alpha’s son, I would be in trouble. They wouldn’t allow me to leave. An Alpha has to mate his first mate, even for a day to come into his full power. “What do you know?” I watched as her eyes searched mine.  
I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. “I don’t know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon’s boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta.” I pulled back. “I don’t want this for me.”  
She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. “Okay baby. But you can’t leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.”  
I tossed my hands in the air. “How would I do that?”  
“There is much you don’t know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure…” She trailed off and I just nodded my head. “Then let me make a few calls. You don’t have to go to school today.”  
I lept back into her arms. “Thank you, mom. I don’t know what I would do without you.”  
“I love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you.” She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room.  
I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.  
I rubbed my flat stomach. “Don’t worry, my pup. This time around, no one will hurt you.”  
I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open.  
I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn’t do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited.  
“I’m telling you, if she is Brandon’s mate, I’m going to kill her.”  
“You can’t mean that, Shan.” The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon’s best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.  
“Of course I do. Brandon is mine.”  
“Only because you put out. He was hoping Shannon would notice him.”  
“You shut your mouth, Megan.” Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. “He’s mine.”  
“Whatever I gotta go. Hurry up before I leave you behind,” Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand.  
“What do you think you’re doing in my closet?”  
“Amy?” Shannon’s mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.  
“You’re lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to kill me. Didn’t I hear that correctly? A beta’s daughter threatening an alpha.” I tsked.  
“I didn’t do anything.” She snarled back at me as her hand reformed.  
“Lie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal.” I couldn’t stop my grin as I felt her tremble. “Did you threaten me?”  
“Yes.” she screamed at me. “You’re going to take Brandon from me.”  
“I don’t want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him.” I pushed her away. “Now get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you.” I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.  
“What is your problem?”  
“You. Now leave.” I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Stupid woman. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that had happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.  
“Pack your bags, Amy.” My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making.  
“What?” I looked up. “Why?”  
“You are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha.” Mom smiled down at me. “Come on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.”  
I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. “I can go?”  
“Just for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.”  
I pouted. “Mom, I really don’t want to be here.” I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn’t risk him finding me.  
“It’s okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad.” She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. “Now get ready.”  
“Okay mom.” I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open.  
“I knew it.” I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.  
“Shannon, why are you screaming?” Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room.  
“I’m not Brandon’s mate, daddy.” Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms.  
“How are you so sure?” Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.  
“It’s you. You stupid wh0'Re.” Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.  
“Amy!” Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked.  
“Morgan, you can’t yell at Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first.” My mom placed my breakfast on the table. “Amy,  
Come eat. You have a long day ahead.”  
“Babe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?”  
“She is going away for the summer. To her fathers.” My mother turned to me and opened her arms. “Come baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.”  
I walked over and sat down, and dug in.  
“Why is she going to her dads?” Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up.  
“She wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?” My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn’t know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it.  
“Yeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven’t seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom.” I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled.  
“You’re leaving?” Shannon stood up.  
“Yup. I’ll be gone the full summer.” I smirked over at her. “But my room is locked, and it will stay that way.” My smile dropped  
away as I stared at her and used my alpha command.  
“Amy!” Morgan yelled out. “You know you’re not allowed to alpha command your step sister!”  
“And I wouldn’t have Morgan, if I hadn’t found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet.” I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie.  
“Is that true?” Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.  
“I wouldn’t lie. I’ll just command you to tell the truth.” She screeched and stomped her foot.  
“Yes!” she screamed. “Are you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon’s mate.”  
“How?” I threw up my hands, playing like I didn’t know the truth. “How could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.”  
“Because he scented you on me!” Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.  
“Calm down. You’re hurting everyone’s ears and just explain yourself.” My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.  
“Last month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy’s dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I’m not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me.” Shannon pouted.  
“So he likes the way I smell, doesn’t mean we are mates.” I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn’t accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.  
Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.  
“Stop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell.” Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. “He’s the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her.” She pointed to me.  
I scoffed. “I don’t want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day in hell before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon.” I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.  
The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves.  
The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It’s said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs. But either way, I wasn’t lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon’s vicinity.  
“You’re lying. He’s the alpha.”  
“And?”  
“Everyone wants to be the luna.”  
“Idiots want to be the luna.” I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.  
“That’s for you.”  
I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.  
I slipped into the back of the car after putting my bags in the back and buckled in. I had barely taken a breath before I launched myself over the seats and into the driver’s arms.  
His laugh made my eyes prickle. “Hey love bug.”  
“Uncle Ronnie. I’ve missed you.” I climbed over the seats and sat up front. “What are you doing here?” Ronnie was my dad’s beta. Not related, but he had been there for most of my life.  
“You think I was going to let my cheeky niece come to pack lands alone? Not on your life.”  
“Dad sent you?” I laughed.  
“Dad sent me. He is a worry wart your da.” He smiled over and laughed with me. “As soon as your mom called, he sent me with the jet.”  
“He didn’t have to.” I just shook my head and buckled my seatbelt.  
“Of course he did. He never gets to see you enough, and now you’re sending in the summer. What’s going on?” My uncle looked at me and I just shook my head.  
“I don’t want to be here.”  
“Why?”  
I looked down at my hands that were twisted. “I’m afraid that my mate is here and I don’t want to be right. I figured if I ran away, I could push off the inevitability.”  
“Why wouldn; t you want your mate?” My uncle asked as he zipped down the highway toward the airport.  
“I’ll tell both you and dad, just not now.” My uncle looked over at me, searching my face and then nodding.  
“Fine, but I want the full story.”  
“You will get it, I swear.” I nodded back to the road. “Now focus on driving so you don’t kill us.” I grabbed the wheel, swerving back into our own lane.  
Uncle Ronnie grabbed the wheel from me and focused back on the road. “I just worry about you, pup.” I couldn’t stop the laugh because wolves stopped aging at twenty-five, and he looked barely older than me.  
“I know you do.” I settled back into my seat and sighed. “I promise, what happened isn’t going to make that feeling any better.” I wiped at my face. “I don’t even know why my mom is sending me to my dad. She just said that he could help me.”  
“Well, let’s hurry and get back so we can figure out what you need, Sugar.” My uncle hit the gas, and we ended up at the airport in no time.  
We loaded my bags and headed up to the jet, settling in there. “Close your eyes. You look like you barely slept today and we have a few hours.” My uncle patted my head before he sat across from me and opened his laptop.  
“Work?”  
“Work.” He nodded.  
“This summer, can you teach me some stuff?” A plan was forming in my mind, a plan not only to keep myself free from my pathetic mate, but one that would make me a lot of money.  
“Of course, Sugar.” My uncle smiled up at me. “You know, your dad would teach you just about everything he could if you were  
open to it.”  
“I asked to move to your pack.” I snuggled into the blanket the flight attendant handed me, and Ronnie froze.  
“What is going on?” His eyes flashed.  
“I’ll explain later. Just promise you will try to believe me and not judge me.”  
“Of course, Sugar.” He smiled and then turned back to the laptop. “Now get some sleep.”  
“Will do.” I turned away and fell asleep almost instantly.  
I woke up to Ronnie shaking me. “We are here.”  
I gave an enormous yawn and cracked my jaw before wiping my eyes. “Okay.” I handed off the blanket and wiped my face again. “Thank you.”  
“No problem, Princess.” The flight attendant smiled down at me, and I realized belatedly that she was from the pack too.  
“You don’t have to call me Princess.”  
“You are the Alpha’s daughter.” She bowed and then left us to our own devices.  
“Come on, your dad has already linked me three times since landing.” Ronnie laughed and whisked me off to the waiting car. With in thirty minutes we were at our pack lands. “You dad would allow you to move here if you wanted to, Sugar.”  
“I know. But Alpha Vince won’t allow me to leave…” I looked over and blew out a breath. “I think he assumes something I am  
running from and won’t let me leave until he knows for sure.”  
“You going to tell me yet, Sugar.”  
I hesitated as we pulled up out front of the pack house. Before I could answer the door was ripped open and I was surrounded by powerful arms and a smell that made my quaking insides settle.  
“Dad.”  
“Hey my pup.” His deep voice calmed me further, and I could feel my eyes prickle.  
“I’ve missed you.” I sniffled as he unbuckled my seat belt and I was in his arms fully.  
“As I have missed you.” He kissed my temple. “Now we have much to discuss.” He was running with me before I could utter another word, with Ronnie following behind.  
“Slow down. Some of us can’t move that fast.” Ronnie struggled to keep up and my laughter filled the halls of the pack house. We settled in my father’s office with an out of breath Ronnie, who was scowling. God, I missed these two.  
“Tell me what’s wrong, pup.” I looked around and still I stumbled over my words. My father grabbed my face and shook his head.  
“Nothing you tell me will change anything, pup. I believe you, no matter how crazy it seems.”  
“Agreed Sugar.”  
My insides settled when I saw how resolute he was. He would believe my craziness. I could tell no matter how crazy my story was, my father and Ronnie would believe everything I said.  
I never had to second guess if I was going crazy here.  
So finally I settled fully and told my story.

# Chapter 1 - The Uninvited Wife's Ruined Gift

Aurelia Cunningham arrived at the hillside villa breathless, only to find the party in full swing.

The gatekeeper looked startled. ""Miss Cunningham? The dinner's already over...""

Her husband’s birthday celebration, and not a soul had thought to invite his own wife. Not one among their so-called friends had bothered to tell her.

She offered the gatekeeper a tight smile and reached for the villa door when snippets of conversation froze her in place.

""Scarlett, what did you bring? Axel’s been eyeing your gift bag like a kid at Christmas.""

""Has he?""

""You haven’t opened it yet? At this rate, he’ll burn holes through the wrapping with his stare. Since you’re back from abroad, why drag this out? Just divorce Aurelia already. Everyone knows this marriage is a farce.""

""Honestly, if Axel hadn’t taken pity on her after she drugged him and trapped him into marriage, the scandal alone would’ve destroyed her.""

The man at the center of the room lounged in a razor-sharp suit, shirt unbuttoned at the throat. His features were lethally perfect—hollowed cheeks, blade-straight nose, lips like a sliver of winter. The faint smirk at his eyes only accentuated his icy detachment.

""Patience.""

""Three years isn’t patience—it’s insanity. After what she did to Scarlett’s sister, turning her into a vegetable? If your grandmother hadn’t shielded her, we’d have handled it ourselves.""

Axel Elliott flicked open a lighter with elegant fingers, his gaze sliding toward the doorway’s shadow.

The room fell silent as heads turned to Aurelia.

""Who let her in?"" someone hissed.

The lack of response was answer enough.

Aurelia lowered her lashes. With her heart-shaped face and delicate frame, she looked more like a storybook heroine than a schemer. Yet the proof stood here in her trembling hands.

The gift box nearly crumpled in her grip as she stared at Axel. Her ribs constricted like a vise, pain sharp enough to steal her breath.

She stepped forward—only for his voice to slice through the air: ""Who invited you?""

Snickers erupted, flaying her pride layer by layer.

Scarlett shot Axel a chiding look and tugged Aurelia down beside her. ""She’s your wife. Of course she’d bring a gift. Don’t mind him, Aurelia—you know how he is.""

Aurelia’s lips pressed into a line. His wife, yet it took his ex-fiancée to defend her place. She’d come anyway, clinging to a decade-old promise made when he swore they’d celebrate his twenty-eighth birthday together.

She deliberately wedged herself between Axel and Scarlett.

Scarlett’s smile flickered. ""What did you get him?""

Someone snatched the box open before she could answer. Inside lay a scarf—no designer tag, just uneven stitches betraying months of labor.

Scarlett brightened. ""What a coincidence! I made one too.""

The twin scarves pooled on the table, equally handcrafted, equally flawless.

A jostled wine bottle tipped. Burgundy liquid surged toward the fabric.

Axel’s hand shot out—saving Scarlett’s. Aurelia’s scarf drowned, reeking of fermented grapes.

She watched the sodden yarn darken, her face bloodless.

Scarlett squeezed her arm. ""Don’t worry, it’ll wash out.""

Aurelia ignored her, eyes locked on Axel.

He didn’t look up.

The party’s mood curdled. One by one, guests excused themselves.

Aurelia remained, staring at the ruined scarf discarded on the table—her mirror image.

As Axel stood to leave, she whispered, ""Happy birthday.""

He walked away without a glance. These people were his inner circle, the ones who’d stood by him at twenty-one when the Elliotts finally acknowledged their bastard son turned business prodigy. Back then, the only constant had been nineteen-year-old Aurelia.

# Chapter 2 - The Weight of Fourteen Years

Those difficult times of shared hardship and obscurity felt like a lifetime ago.

Axel had someone escort Scarlett back.

Scarlett reached out and lightly touched his shoulder. ""Try to talk things out properly, instead of arguing all the time.""

Someone scoffed. ""Scarlett, you’re too soft-hearted.""

""It’s not about being soft-hearted. I just think Aurelia was young and foolish back then—she couldn’t have known any better.""

""Known better? That’s rich. She ruined someone’s life and shamelessly took your place. How dare she show her face again?""

The voice dripped with contempt before fading away.

Aurelia sat frozen, as if struck by a spell, every drop of blood in her veins turning to ice. Her lips paled slightly.

She stood, grabbing her soaked scarf, and looked at Axel.

""Axel.""

Her voice was quiet, submissive.

Axel had already draped his suit jacket over his arm. At her call, he adjusted his tie without glancing her way, his brows visibly tense. ""What now?""

She smiled, her beautiful lips parting as she said, ""Let’s get a divorce, Axel.""

A flicker of surprise crossed his eyes before they darkened with anger. ""What kind of game are you playing now? First, you drug me to get me into bed, and now you’re acting all high and mighty with this divorce talk. Aurelia, aren’t you tired of this act?""

""I’m sorry for wasting three years of your life. But this time, I mean it.""

The mockery in Axel’s gaze faded inch by inch. He yanked her close, fingers digging into her chin until she winced in pain. Only then did the suffocating frustration inside him ease slightly. ""You’re sorry now? Where the hell was this regret three years ago? Listen, Aurelia, if you want a divorce, fine. But don’t expect a single penny from me.""

""I’ll leave with nothing.""

Her eyes were clear, her voice steady despite the storm around her.

Back when Axel had been reclaimed by the Windsor family, Aurelia, who had stayed by his side, was given the title of goddaughter by his parents. Everyone knew it was the Windsors’ way of ensuring their long-lost second son wouldn’t marry a woman of no standing—offering her a symbolic role to silence the gossip.

Axel stared at her cold, composed face, his throat working silently before he turned away.

""Fine. Leave with nothing. Don’t come crawling back.""

Outside, rain had begun to fall. The mansion sat atop a secluded hill in the countryside, far from any easy transportation.

The others had already driven off. Aurelia had arrived by cab, and now she stood alone under the eaves, watching the drizzle.

A black Rolls-Royce cut through the rain, stopping in front of her. The window rolled down, revealing the face of Axel’s assistant, Dane.

""Mrs. Windsor, get in.""

Aurelia didn’t move. Her gaze slipped past the gap in the window, as if she knew someone else sat in the shadows behind it.

She said nothing, and Axel’s voice soon cut through the silence.

""Drive. Let her stand there and sober up.""

Dane hesitated, then drove off without another glance at Aurelia.

She blinked as the car disappeared into the rain, the cold seeping into her bones.

At eighteen, Axel had looked forward to celebrating his twenty-eighth birthday with her. But at twenty-eight, he despised her completely.

In three years of marriage, he had never touched her—had barely even come home.

In their circle, she was considered the most pitiful of all the women who had married into wealth: a gilded cage, and nothing more.

To everyone else, she was the villain who had turned Scarlett’s sister into a vegetable and stolen Scarlett’s fiancé—a woman who deserved nothing but scorn.

No one seemed to remember that from the age of twelve to nineteen, she had stood by Axel through his lowest moments, watched him rise from obscurity.

They said the Windsors had given her the title of goddaughter, yet she remained ungrateful, trying to chain Axel down with the weight of seven years of companionship.

Now, another seven years had passed. All told, she had been by his side for fourteen years.

Lowering her lashes, she stared at her phone. No drivers were willing to take her order.

By the time she returned to Crestview Bay, it was past two in the morning. Her dress clung to her ankles, soaked through, and the late autumn chill left her lips trembling.

The mansion’s lights were still on. As she changed her shoes in the foyer, she spotted the man on the couch, buried in paperwork.

Axel’s bone structure was flawless—his face breathtaking no matter how many times she saw it.

Seated there, he was an untouchable mountain.

Aurelia knew better than to think he was waiting for her. Three years ago, they had torn everything apart. The bright-eyed girl she once was had vanished, replaced by a stranger in the mirror—someone she no longer recognized.

Quietly, she finished changing, tossed her scarf into the trash by the door, and headed upstairs.

# Chapter 3 - The Weight of an Unworthy Heart

She carried a small suitcase, packed only with her most frequently worn casual clothes. The wall full of designer handbags and jewelry remained untouched.

Axel had said she wasn’t worthy.

In his eyes, she was nothing but a gold-digger—someone who craved wealth but couldn’t bring herself to touch the luxury surrounding her. To him, that was her punishment.

Aurelia descended the stairs, suitcase in hand, and placed the signed divorce papers on the coffee table.

“Axel, I’ve signed them.”

For three years, every encounter had been a battle—or rather, her screaming accusations, raging against his indifference, playing the madwoman just to elicit a reaction. And he? He’d stand there, cold and detached, watching her unravel like a spectator at a train wreck.

Axel’s gaze flicked from his laptop to her suitcase. His throat burned as if doused with acid, the heat searing down to his gut.

A derisive laugh escaped him, his voice icy enough to freeze her blood.

“Packing so light—planning to come back for more later? Aurelia, have you forgotten how you got here? When Scarlett and I got engaged, you drugged me at our party, made sure we were caught in bed, and forced me to marry you.”

“It was my fault.”

Her fingers tightened around the suitcase handle, her face ghostly pale, the hem of her dress soaked from the rain. She looked moments from collapsing.

She clenched her fists, silent for a long beat before forcing out the words, voice frayed.

“Axel, I just want to know… why you stopped loving me.”

Three years of turning this question over in her mind. Back when they’d clung to each other in that cramped apartment, he’d whispered promises—Axel will love Aurelia forever. Then the Rockwells found him, and warnings came: Take the money and run. They’ll never accept you.

She hadn’t listened. She’d clung to that vow, waiting for him to return and marry her in splendor.

Instead, she got news of his engagement to Scarlett. I don’t love you anymore.

Why? What had changed?

“Because you’re not worthy.”

Five words, a sledgehammer to her chest. The pain was indescribable—her heart punctured, bleeding out.

When he loved her, she’d been the best girl in the world. Now? Dismissed with a phrase.

She’d defended their love to high-society sneers, playing the delusional knight, convinced his engagement was forced.

Three years of lies. Time to wake up.

She lifted her suitcase and turned toward the foyer. “Sign the papers. I’ll meet you at the courthouse tomorrow at noon.”

Slipping on her shoes, she tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and offered a faint smile. “Axel… sorry for wasting your time all these years.”

Axel’s grip on the documents turned lethal, his fingers nearly shredding the paper before he let go.

“Yeah. Finally free.”

The words lanced through her, but she didn’t flinch. Laughing was impossible.

So she left.

Dane waited by the door, his expression troubled at the sight of her suitcase. “Mrs. Rockwell, the CEO didn’t mean to leave you in the dark tonight. He—”

Aurelia dragged her suitcase into the rain, as if fleeing a burning building.

But after a few steps, she paused and turned back.

“Who is he keeping at Oak Manor?” Her voice was soft, almost drowned by the rain.

Dane stiffened, head snapping down as if struck.

Aurelia exhaled at his reaction. “Three years, hasn’t he?”

“Mrs. Rockwell, I—I don’t know.”

Liar. Axel’s shadow knew everything.

She wiped rain from her face, her clothes now drenched. “Fine. Keep your secrets.”

“Mrs. Rockwell—”

What I finally landed on was:

SIBO: biofilm busters with rifaxamin Dysbiosis: phgg, resistant starch, kefir. I did take custom probiotics d lactate free for a bit but prefer kefir overall so stopped it Any potential candida: biofilm busters with coconut oil (EDIT: I’ve been told Monolaurin is actually better for this than coconut oil, and also Monolaurin itself is a better antimicrobial so more likely to help get rid of bad bacteria - think it’s crucial actually to start taking something like this initially to get rid of bad bacteria/candida) 

Vitamins: vitamin d with k2. Think my overall b vitamin levels are probably a lot better now I’ve cleared gut issues so probably get them from food. 

Exercise and breathwork: regular HIIT workouts, weightlifting, yoga, vagus nerve work (humming mostly).

Diet: super fibre rich, lots of protein, carbs etc. I did no alcohol for ages, I found no caffeine miserable so switched to purely black coffee. I can now actually go and drink and get drunk, but I opt not to because I don’t need it.

THINGS THAT IT HAS HELPED WITH: Anhedonia, insomnia, depression, anxiety, sexual sides, visual disturbances. 

THINGS STILL A BIT SLUGGISH: Do still have some extra fatigue like I am more tired by eg 6/7 pm then pre finasteride, but this noticeably improves week by week

Edit: credit u/sassyfoods123 mainly with helping me develop something that works for me. Think it actually works better for me than it does for him now as he’s had really long term candida issues

Edit 2: think resistant starch, kefir, and phgg is what’s helped probably patch up leaky gut type issues, due to increasing butyrate producing bacteria

Edit 3: If you decide to opt this route, it is super normal to feel like shit at the start. Killing off candida/bad bacteria flares your system hard through die off. I felt pretty horrible for like 2/3 weeks

Edit 4: Make sure to be killing bad bacteria while reestablishing good. U/sassyfoods123 who’s helped me recommended biofilm busters and then 15 mins after Ceylon cinnamon, monolaurin , and possibly blackseed oil (he adapted Kyle’s approach) ",1,1752918313.0,FinasterideSyndrome,0,1.0,False

I started going to a nearby park to read and clear my head. One day, while sipping cheap coffee and pretending to read Sapiens, a golden retriever ran up and dropped a stick at my feet. Naturally, I threw it. He brought it back. We bonded. For 30 minutes, it was magic.

Then a woman jogged over and yelled, “Hey! That’s not your dog!”
Long story short, I had accidentally walked halfway across the park with someone else's retriever. I apologized, half-laughing, half-dying inside.

But here’s the twist — the jogger laughed with me, not at me. We chatted. She said I looked like I needed a dog more than she did. I didn’t get her number, but I did walk home feeling something I hadn’t felt in months: alive.

That moment pushed me out of isolation. I started smiling at strangers. Joined a book club. Stopped overthinking. Life didn't become perfect, but it became possible again.

They successfully relocated from the US to the Netherlands last year, and they were kind enough to answer some questions about their experience through the lens of language.



*You mentioned you moved with your family. How are they adapting to the new linguistic landscape? For instance, the kiddos, how are they finding the language at school or daycare, and how do you navigate being a multilingual family in a new country?*

School is very understanding and the teacher makes sure the kid understand the activities, first they are explained in Dutch and the teacher translates to the kid. This is a public school. Everybody is very welcoming. In our house we speak English, I speak exclusively English at work. I've heard from internationals that after years now speaking Dutch that their problem now is natives still speak to them in English.  


*What's one Dutch word or phrase you've learned that has given you an 'aha!' moment about the culture.* 

I like the word ""toekomst"" which means ""future"", it turns out in English we got it from latin ""futurum"" whereas in Dutch is just something that is ""to come"" -> ""toe(e)kom(st)"" I found that funny. There are many words like that. Also it seems the pronunciation is closer to the writing, in English is never enough to know how something is written, you have to know how is pronunced (that's why we have spelling bee contests).



*As a non-white American, you're navigating two layers of ""otherness."" How does this feel when you're trying to speak Dutch? Do you ever feel an extra pressure to ""get it right,"" or conversely, do you find people are perhaps more patient because they have fewer preconceived notions about what a ""Dutch-speaking American"" should sound like?*

Not really, but mainly because I barely speak any Dutch, I'm really a beginner and can only say thinks like milk and cheese (Duolingo basic level).  


*There's a Dutch word, regelneef, for someone who is a stickler for the rules. In navigating the maze of getting your BSN and setting up a life, have you had a run-in with a classic regelneef? Any situations in general where your Dutch has made the situation more challenging or comical?*

I had a comic situation where ordering coffee, my co-worker ordered a Cappuccino, and I said ""Cappuccino ook"" (ook means ""me too"" or ""as well"") and the barista thought I said ""oat""... as in ""oat milk"", so I got my Cappuccino with oat milk because trying to clarify the situation was making it worse. Another English speaking colleague, when trying to order a kilo of rice said ""een kilo of rijst"" got served eight kilos, because they thought ""een"" was ""eight.""

**For trial #2** I cut my SR dose nearly in half, down to about 20MGs, and I waited until my sleep cycle was over.

I did experience a bit of drowsiness, but nothing coffee couldn't fix.  More importantly, I was able to skip my first dose of DOC.  I went nearly 5 hours before dosing, and I have in my notes I probably could have gone longer, but anxiety got the best of me.  Still, I see this as a promising test.  Normally I would have dosed shortly after waking.

**For trial #3** I decided to try skipping an evening dose after I had dosed DOC a couple times during the day.  Indeed, I was able to create another 5 hour window in the evening, during which I felt totally fine.  I did not dose DOC until much later in the evening than normal.  Again, this feels like another successful trial.

I plan to test SR as a temporary substitute a few more times and then creating a full-on schedule for me to hopefully adhere to and  drop my DOC entirely.   My doses that create these windows are quite small considering my DOC.  I was expecting to need much more, but time will tell when I fully jump in.  Perhaps DOC doesn't matter.  I remember reading that here recently. 

Big thanks to my lost (for now) source,  I'm glad I stocked up ASAP, my SR seems very potent.  He foretold months ago that it would return from China, and that prices would drop, and he was right.  He also didn't cut it at all, it would seem.   I probably don't need anymore, but I'd still like to track him down.  He got clean on the first round of it, and now wants to help as many people as possible.  He also advised to keep a little extra around after getting clean, says it knocks out the occasional craving for him.   I know he had a lot of stock before the markets went boom, so if I can help people find some I will. 

When it first hit the scene and no one really knew what it was, I bought several Gs before it disappeared.  I've yet to try the old stuff, the new stuff seems to work great.

1m3s259,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldWideWipeoutCamp/comments/1m3s259/more_writing/,MORE Writing 😋,"Blowtorch woke up in cold sweat, body trembling and tears staining her eyes. A tiny part of her wants to go back to sleep so she has enough energy for tomorrow’s challenge and Atlas won’t be disappointed in her, but she couldn’t bring herself to back to bed after her strange dream.

In her dream, she was exploring a dazzling, futuristic city with Atlas by her side. The only strange detail at the beginning was Atlas’ expressionless face and his weirdly quiet demeanor.

This sequence felt like the longest part of her dream, but most of what she experienced passed by like hazy blur. Unfortunately, the later half of her nightmare is what she recalled most vividly.

The city landscape became completely destroyed and dilapidated, with dark ash drifting amidst the air that made her lungs feel constricted. World Atlas whispered something into her ear, and she didn’t know why, but what script said made her cry so loudly and pathetically.

Once Blowtorch wept, all she could see in her vision were bright reds and oranges, like she was trapped in a hellish inferno.

She whimpered softly at her internal recollection. Was this a manifestation of people’s fears about Atlas’ malicious intentions? While script was an oddball, script never seemed like the type of person force others to cry. 

Regardless, Blowtorch did begrudgingly understood people’s qualms about script. She knew that his kind treatment of her might change if she was more openly critical of him like their teammates were.

To distract herself from reminders about her nightmare or the possibility of World Atlas hurting her, Blowtorch observed her dark surroundings. Most of her teammates are still asleep, with the exception of Ice Cream and Tree Topper.

For the life of her, she did not understand why a twelve year-old like Ice Cream was allowed on the show with no parental guidance.

“I don’t get it Mr. Tree!!!!” Ice Cream whined.

“You can just call me Tree-Topper, no need to be so formal!”

What on earth were these two talking about in the middle of the night?

“Atlas was kinda mean when he said that I’m too young to work under script, but that doesn’t mean he’s evil!”

Tree Topper rubbed his temples and Ice Cream’s frown depended.

“Look, Ice Cream, you don’t have to hate him, but please keep your distance. That guy has a hair-trigger temper! He doesn’t like anyone who suggests anything against scripts plans.”

Ice Cream hummed in understanding, but Blowtorch was less convinced by his words.

“While that may be true, script’s plans aren’t bad ideas…r-right? B-Besides, we all have our flaws—I’m a big anxious coward, and…uhh, at least World Atlas has the guts to believe in his ideas and explain them proudly…” 

Blowtorch meant to state that to herself, but it seemed her words reached the others’ ears.

Tree Topper eyed her curiously, and she covered her mouth instinctively even after already voicing her opinion. 

“I know you have some attachment to him because you were on the same team, but that doesn’t mean you should blindly defend him! And script doesn’t always have the best ideas, script forced me to go on some useless road-trip last challenge just for nothing to come out of it.”

Blowtorch shrinked into herself at Tree Topper’s words. God, why did she have to be so dumb and careless?! Often, she wished she more like Atlas, someone brimming with self confidence and a conviction to defend himself.

Ice Cream looked back and forth between Blowtorch and Tree Topper for a few moments in contemplative silence. After a while, she cheerfully said “Yeah, I’m with Mr. Topper on this one. Roadtrips are fun, but not with guys who won’t listen to you!”

Ice Cream and Tree Topper’s light chatter filled the air, and they discussed miscellaneous things about the previous challenges or what their lives were like before the competition. Blowtorch didn’t want to rest, but she didn’t want to converse with people who definitely judged her for tolerating Atlas.

After several minutes, despite the background noise, Blowtorch eventually fell asleep and without any nightmares haunting her. 

…Despite the lack of nightmares, her next moment of lucidity wasn’t so pleasant.

“BLOWTORCH!! WAKE UP THIS INSTANT!! ALYSA ANNOUNCED THE NEXT CHALLENGE AND IT’S IMPERATIVE WE WORK TOGETHER!!!” 

World Atlas’s instruction was Blowtorch’s alarm clock for the day, and she couldn’t help but grumble at scripts sudden entrance.

“Ugh….what…time is it???” she asked tiredly while rubbing her eyes.

“IT’S CHALLENGE TIME OF COURSE!!!”

Blowtorch didn’t feel like correcting his misinterpretation of her statement.

She stood up and stretched all her six arms to rejuvenate herself as Atlas explained the present challenge.

“BASICALLY, SOME BURGLARS ARE TRYING TO STEAL FOOD FROM A TRUCK TRAVELING FROM VEVEY TO BERN THEN ZURICH AIRPORT! SIMPLE CHALLENGE RIGHT?? ALL WE NEED IS SOME RELIABLE FIREARMS!”

Blowtorch ceased her exercising. Her stomach dropped at that last sentence.

“F-FIREARMS?!? WE’RE GO-GOING TO SHOOT PEOPLE?!?” she questioned incredulously.

“WELL, WE NEED SOME WAY OF DEFENDING THE TRUCKS AND OURSELVES, CORRECT? BESIDES, IT’S NOT—“

Before Atlas can even finish scripts statement, Blowtorch interrupted him.

“Couldn’t we at LEAST try for a less violent solution??! Like, I…I don’t know! Painless tranquilizers—if those are a thing—or…or keep the gun idea but make it…water guns??”

After saying that, World Atlas’ once jovial face morphed into one of barely restrained anger and disappointment. 

Blowtorch was about to apologize profusely for her statement but—to her relief—Atlas laughed heartily instead of blowing up at her.

“WOW! THAT’S A SOLID GOOD IDEA, BLOWTORCH! WITH YOUR SUGGESTION, WE COULD AVOID ANY POTENTIAL LAWSUITS AND NOT LOSE OUR MONEY!” 

“Wait, so…you’re n-not mad?? Or even interested in….uh, firing me for disrespecting you?”

Atlas stayed quiet for a few moments, staring at her intently. Blowtorch tried her best to not let her discomfort at his gaze show.

“…THERE’S A REASON YOU’VE BEEN GIVEN THE TITLE OF BEST EMPLOYEE AT MY COMPANY! YOU’VE BEEN SUPPORTING MY BUSINESS SINCE THE BEGINNING! HAHAHA!”  

Blowtorch wanted to remind him that she was scripts only employee, but she decided it was best she held her tongue. 

Her and World Atlas got off the plane and joined the other contestants on Swiss land.

As soon as they both reached the ground, Spotify waved at Blowtorch and she returned with a “Hello!”. Atlas was evidently less happy to see them, but script didn’t say anything to Spotify. 

“Well, Atlas, what do you…suggest we do? I proposed water guns and…tranquilizers but if there’s anything else you think is better, we can do that instead. Last challenge proved that..I’m…you know…”

She seriously doubted someone like World Atlas would listen to her ideas, and she was more than willing to acquiesce on his demands if it meant staying on scripts good side.

“DON’T DOUBT YOURSELF BLOWTORCH! LAST CHALLENGE, THE FIRST ORIGIN STORY YOU’VE WRITTEN FOR NESSIE ON MY BEHALF WAS GOOD!”

The only reason that story was “good” was because Atlas gave her very heavy criticism on  it. If there was one example of Atlas almost bringing her to tears, it would be his harsh scrutiny at her story ideas and grammar.

“BUT THE SECOND STORY YOU SENT TO ALYSA WAS…ABYSMAL..”

Those words stung, but that was undeniably true. With World Atlas’s help, her first submission garnered a nine! But on her own…

“A zero out of ten, is…really, really  embarrassing… Uh, yeah… I wanted to submit something that was closer to what I wanted to write about… But! But…clearly, your help was really appreciated!“

Script smiled at her response. Blowtorch wondered if that was just because of her compliment towards script at the end, and less because Atlas actually appreciated her as a “star employee”.

“WELL, HOW ABOUT A COMPROMISE THEN? WHEN THE TRUCK TRAVELS FROM VEVEY TO BERN, WE WORK ON MY IDEA, AND ON THE ROAD TO THE AIRPORT, WE USE YOURS!”

Blowtorch stared wide-eyed at Atlas from scripts suggestion, but eventually gave her “manager” a triple thumbs up of approval.

Soon, Alysa called for the everyone to gather around her as she elaborated more on the latest challenge.  

“Alright contestants! With Sharpie’s unexpected departure, both teams have eight members each, which is ideal for this challenge.”

“Perfect for this challenge? What in tarnation do you mean by that?” Guitar asked.

“Tomorrow, eight trucks are leaving from Vevey to go to Bern, then Zurich Airport, with each truck going on different travel routes! The day after tomorrow, another series of eight trucks would follow the same pattern!”

“Ideally, each team should plan out which member goes out on which day. You have today to start planning and gathering any materials you want for defending the trucks.”

Blowtorch looked at Atlas and his face had a sullen expression due to Alysa’s message. Blowtorch felt his pain, after last challenge, there was no way she was convinced she can work independently without scripts guidance.

Atlas raised scripts hand and shouted “ALYSA! IS THERE A POSSIBILITY FOR TWO PEOPLE TO WORK TOGETHER?! BLOWTORCH AND I WERE PLANNING TO TEAM UP TOMORROW!”

Blowtorch’s cheeks flushed from embarrassment as all contestant eyes were on her and World Atlas. Her manager…really has a way of bringing attention, mostly negative attention, to himself.

“Uhhh…technically okay, but one of you would have to work on your own for the second day. Just be aware of that.”

Alysa’s response made Atlas’ mouth curve back to its signature grin.

Once Alysa was done answering any queries about the challenge, the contestants entered the airport and collectively decided to visit a coffee shop. Each team gathered separately to drink and discuss who travels on which day. The Piko Piko Hammers team sat at the back of the shop, and Blowtorch opted to sit by Atlas’ right side.

Tree Topper left the group temporarily to give their orders to the cashier. Once Tree Topper returned with everyone’s beverages, Atlas was unsurprisingly the first one to speak up about the challenge.

“ME AND BLOWTORCH WILL TRAVEL TOGETHER TOMORROW, AND THE NEXT DAY, BLOWTORCH WILL WORK ON HER OWN!”  

She nearly spat out her latte from the latter part of scripts statement.

“I’ll…be working..without you?! I-I don’t think that’s… I don’t think I can—“

“NONSENSE, BLOWTORCH! I’M SURE THAT AFTER MY HELP, YOU’LL BE INSPIRED THE NEXT DAY TO DO SOMETHING INGENIOUS!”

Blowtorch nodded, but Spotify wasn’t convinced she was completely on board with his plan.

“World Atlas, why are you forcing this poor girl to work with you? Not only that, but you’re also ordering her to do this already difficult challenge twice for some fucking reason!”  

Several patrons at the cafe looked at Spotify’s outburst in curiosity. Spotify’s voice grew louder regardless.

“Are you sure this is what Blowtorch really wants, or are you just making decisions for her because you don’t want her to think for herself?! Are you afraid that if you gave her that choice, she’ll want nothing to do with you??”

Atlas opened his mouth to presumably give Spotify a lengthy lecture or a clever retort, yet instead of talking, he nudged Blowtorch with his elbow.

“What!?? Atlas, what are you doing?!” Blowtorch screamed to herself.

Paranoia and confusion consumed her body from that simple gesture. Did Atlas want her to be the one to respond to Spotify?!? She wasn’t good at making a case for herself but…Atlas believing in her must mean something, right?

“Look…I..uhm…” Blowtorch said barely above a whisper.

She cleared her throat and coughed awkwardly.

“It’s tru-true that…Atlas…confronted me first! But, I don’t really have a problem with it! Y-yeah! Attacking burglars without any, uh, experience is the dream! Ha! Ha….”

Atlas gave her a look of sour disapproval, and Spotify looked even more suspicious of Atlas’ intentions. 

Script quickly hid his look of contempt with a smile and stood up while holding his iced “chai tea”.

“PIKO PIKO HAMMERS, YOU CAN DISCUSS AMONGST YOURSELVES WHEN THE OTHERS WILL DEFEND THE TRUCKS. AS FOR ME AND BLOWTORCH, OUR DECISIONS ARE SET, SO WE’LL BE VENTURING OUTSIDE TO PREPARE FOR TOMORROW!”

Atlas grabbed one of her many hands and they exited the cafe together, though Blowtorch less willingly. 

“Atlas…I’m sorry! I fucked up, I… could’ve done SO MUCH better with…”

He squeezed her hand tighter.

“Let’s not talk about what you did earlier. LET’S INSTEAD DIRECT OUR ATTENTION INTO BUYING ALL THAT WE NEED!”

They both stopped walking and Atlas released his firm grip on her hand.

“HOW ABOUT WE BUY THOSE…WATER GUNS YOU TALKED ABOUT??? THOSE ARE MORE EASILY ACCESSIBLE THAN TRANQUILIZERS! ALONG WITH MY OWN EQUIPMENT OF COURSE!”

“Uhm, sure! I…guess.”

The pair ventured outside the airport to look for supplies in the nearest mall. Blowtorch was thankful it was only twenty minutes away from where they landed.

Besides getting kicked from five stores because of Atlas harassing the salespeople into giving them a “COMPETITION SHOW DISCOUNT”, getting what they need was rather mundane and easy.

What Blowtorch didn’t understand was why she had some semblance of a weapon—those being the three bright red water guns she picked—but all World Atlas had in scripts hand was a slightly crumpled piece of paper.

“ALRIGHT, BLOWTORCH! OUR WORK TODAY IS OVER! JUST BE CAREFUL WITH THOSE WATER GUNS! Drowning is a really terrifying way to die.”

Blowtorch blinked in confusion at his off-putting statement.

“Well…uhm…not sure these could even hurt someone, much less by drowning, but I’ll be careful!”

She’s couldn’t help but chuckle at his uncharacteristic nervousness, since being overly anxious was a trait she exhibited more.

World Atlas was foolish for assuming someone like her could injure someone, much less kill.

1m3s139,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1m3s139/the_train/,The Train,"I’ve made my peace with Iarnród Éireann selling our data to fund cheaper Wi-Fi.

Now that I can take a neutral view of the service itself, I can honestly say,
I just love taking the train.

Anyone else around my age feel the same?

Don’t worry, I’m not some relentlessly upbeat, eco-conscious martyr who thinks taking the train is a noble sacrifice for the planet, floating around like some virtuous beam of sunlight.

I love driving, always have. It comes from my obsession with competitive motorsport.
I love riding motorcycles even more. So no, sustainability, emissions, and green thinking aren’t exactly my guiding stars.

Speed, the engineering of it, turns me on.
I’m not ashamed of that.

I don’t speed often on public roads, but I do sometimes, like almost everyone else.
Because I just love going fast.

Think about it. We’re these soft-skinned, two-legged, slow-moving animals.
We shouldn’t be able to rip across land at 170 miles per hour on machines we built with our own hands, and not die.
We went from hunter gatherers to farmers to being capable of anticipating dynamic actor behavior at 170 miles per hour in crosswinds.

That is insane and amazing.
It is a testament to how special, how adaptable, human beings really are.
If you’re bored of life, maybe you’re just looking at the wrong things in the wrong way.

So yes, I’m pro train and pro car. Both.

Road safety is important, sure. But humans are unpredictable, and trying to eliminate all risk is a fantasy.
Words like aerodynamic, nanometer, carbon fiber, kinetic energy recovery system, holeshot, crossplane, valve lash, tolerance, they get my juices flowing.

But as much as I love cars and bikes, they serve a different need.

There’s something about sitting in those surprisingly comfy train seats, varies by carriage obviously,
watching the world roll by.
Looking out the window at people stuck in traffic, busy ants trying to squeeze maximum value out of every second, minute, and hour.

In a car, we are in control. We get to wage war on time, take shortcuts, overtake, leave earlier, change direction on a whim.

On a train, all of that is stripped away.
You surrender control to the driver, to the tracks, to the scheduled stops.

And in my mind, that is liberating.
Massively underappreciated.

We're constantly pumped up, focused on making the most of our shrinking leisure time.
So we rush place to place, buy stuff, scout more stuff to buy later, sip a coffee to refuel for the next round of dopamine.

I’m not sure I even have a point to finish on. 
It could have just stayed in my head too, why the need to share such an inconsequential personal thought? 

Probably belongs in r/Showerthoughts,
but really, it’s an extended musing on how losing control for a moment , like on a train, can feel like regaining perspective.

1m3rykz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m3rykz,Beyond the buzz of Wrocław Rynek ✨,"Behind the buzzing Wrocław Rynek, Pawła Włodkowica Street is where Wrocław exhibits a slower, deeper character. The leafy promenade along the Fosa Miejska, once a defensive moat and the site of a tragic 18th-century explosion wiping out half the street, is a great spot to peek into the city's Jewish heritage. 

Those city defence walls, prominent until Prussian times, were dismantled by Napoleon's raiding army at the beginning of the 19th century. And made way for the stunning leafy boulevard (bulwar).

It often gets skipped by tourists, but this entire bulwar arch along Podwale Street is where stories from Prussian times, when the city was called Breslau, come alive. It's the Jewish district of Wrocław where people of four different faiths used to coexist.

What to expect here? Post-war rebuilds, secessionist façades, Kino Nowe Horyzonty—the city’s largest arthouse cinema and a proud flag bearer of Wrocław's artistic pulse, the National Forum of Music, one of Poland’s most impressive - White Stork Synagogue with its courtyard from pre-war Breslau; the district courthouse; and the art-splashed walls near Mleczarnia. This is where time slows down and history lingers. 

PURO Hotel and Bułka z Masłem bring stunning green outdoor spaces, and locals love hanging out in the leafy promenade area. Grabbing an ice cream or sipping coffee under chestnut trees, few realise they’re sitting atop layers of vanished cemeteries, former libraries, and the beating pulse of Wrocław.

1m3rxoc,https://i.redd.it/0zuv3prutsdf1.jpeg,Grinding issue [sage barista express],"Hi folks,

I got myself a Sage Barista Express a few weeks back and have been using the remains of some crappy old dark roast super market beans. For these I had the internal bur set to 2 and the outer wheel set to 4, that worked fairly well.

I just bought myself some lovely beans from a local roaster, they’re washed medium roast beans. I dropped some into the hopper and went to grind them, a few beans were ground however the grinder immediately jammed. I had to remove the hopper and suck out the remaining beans with a vacuum to clear it.

I assumed i was grinding too fine, so I adjusted the internal bur to 4 and changed the outer wheel to 10. It ground to a halt and jammed almost immediately.

Tried some more of the old beans, and they went through just fine. Then tried the new beans through a friends stand alone grinder, which did grind them however they had somewhat of a popcorn effect in the hopper, constantly pinging around.

1m3rxl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1m3rxl6/sometimes_it_just_simply_gets_too_much/,Sometimes it just simply gets too much,"Long time lurker, first time poster here. Quick background: I (30s) have been a step parent to SS (7) for 4 years. 50/50 arrangement during school and school holidays.

SS is a really nice kid. He’s sweet, funny, etc. And I do genuinely like him (but can’t say that I “love” him) and we do have lots of fun together. But sometimes it just gets too much. And it’s not because I don’t like him or anything (see above) but I’ve never wanted kids of my own as it’s not a lifestyle I ever wanted so it does cost me energy and patience when he’s here full time for longer periods (ie 1 week, 2 weeks). When he’s here, all attention and energy from the parent goes towards him. Anything we do during the weekend / week of holiday is to entertain SS. And I fully understand that. He’s young, needs to be entertained and my partner wants to be a present and loving parent. However, it also means that I reach my limit at some point and I’m happy when he goes back to the other parent. We just came back from a 5-day holiday (during which he woke us up 3 times due to peeing the bed, falling out of the bed, purely waking up too early). So, sleep hasn’t been great. 

My partner, SS and I live in my house. I try my best to consider it “our” house but I pay off the mortgage and the majority of the costs. And I can’t help but feel that sometimes “my” space just simply gets invaded (too much) and I don’t feel at peace in my own home (although again, I realise it’s in practice “our” home but I can’t help feel that way) - it also doesn’t help that the house is usually filled with SS and parent’s stuff (whereas I like things to be neat and clean). SS rarely ever plays on his own, always needs parent to be there except when he watches TV. He never plays in his room. He’s mostly in the living room, sometimes in the garden - but, again, always with the parent. I find that he takes up a lot of energy, space and attention. When parent and I take a short coffee break together, the majority of the time he either comes to us or asks things from parent from a distance (eg to change the TV channel, help him with toys, etc.). It’s fine for a while but after a week, I start getting tired of it and am just relieved when he leaves and it starts being difficult to hide my emotions vis-à-vis parent. This morning we got into a bit of an argument because parent did not appreciate my honest response when asked what I would do when they’re both out for a bit shortly. I responded “chill and decompress because it’s getting a bit too much now”. At Maybe I should not be that straightforward? But that’s my character and I also don’t want to hide my feelings. At that moment, one of my dogs started playing with a loud toy and SS complained. I responded to SS “the dog can also play here, it’s their house too”. Then parent also (allegedly jokingly) said to give the dog a quieter toy. I got annoyed and said “can we (ie my dogs and me) also enjoy our time and do things? We’re not just here to sit in silence and in the background while you and SS do as you please.” I admit I should have phrased it differently but it shows you how I feel. I added, to explain my emotions, that “it costs me a lot of energy to be around SS for longer periods of time and I need to decompress from that so I can ‘relax’ again”. Anyway, parent is now upset with me, thinks I should have responded differently to SS. I just feel that parent doesn’t try to understand my POV and that I’m not SS parent so therefore may have different emotions and reactions vis-à-vis him and perhaps I don’t enjoy his presence as much as parent does and that I need my space and time to myself - especially if we just got back from holiday and he wrecked our nights of sleep. When SS is here, I basically feel like a side character in my own home and struggle to find peace. I feel like my body is in flight or fight mode somehow? And it’s made worse by the fact that I can’t seem to express that (correctly?) to parent and they don’t (want to) understand my POV (whereas I try to place myself in their shoes - see second para above). I feel like I’m always the evil villain when I explain how I feel. Perhaps I shouldn’t? Or perhaps I should express my feelings before I feel like I reached my limits?

TL;DR: After longer periods of time (1,2 weeks), I struggle with SS’s presence and am relieved he goes back to other parent. I don’t feel fully relaxed when he’s here. I struggle to hide that emotion from my partner. When I do express myself, I feel like I’m not being understood or met with empathy.

Anyway, rant over. I just feel like I need to vent. Anyone feel the same? Any thoughts? (Constructive) criticism or tips?

So I ordered a bunch of samples from 4160 Tuesdays and got sent a few extra so I thought I’d do a little review. Samples come in a beautiful little box and wrapped like little sweeties in tissue paper. Most had scent profile cards. All came with a personalised note. You definitely feel that this is nice and high end and the customer service is fantastic. As others have said, this brand seem to excel at gourmands and vanillas and I couldn’t agree more. Full sizes are a bit pricey but I did get sent a discount code with my purchase for full sizes,

**Amberama**: Lovely feminine amber and not an aftershave old man amber. Nice to use a base for other perfumes and nice to wear alone. 

**Both Sides of Clouds**: First spray is 80’s perfume but dries down beautifully and is a gorgeous orris. Reminiscent of Molton Brown Suede and Orris

**Burnt Cedar Rainbow Doves**: cedar and marshmallow. Not sure about wearability but putting it on made me happy. 

**Centrepiece**: honey and bees wax and very warm. Captures a candle lit dinner table very well

**Court of Ravens**: Incense rose. A weird one. I wore it whilst reading the Raven scholar and it helped me get into the book’s world building. There’s something medicinal in this that sets my teeth on edge a bit. Website says there are aromatic herbs so it could be that. The musk and base notes are lovely though, very evocative of an old chapel with polished panelling and dusty incense.

**Creamy Vanilla Crumble**: vanilla and hay- I think it’s a good masculine, summer vanilla not a cosy winter feminine one.

**Gingersnap**: Not sweet but very savoury that gets a little soapy. I think it would be good boosting another perfume. 

**Hammersmith Tea and biscuits:** lovely, reminiscent of D&G  devotion but with a tea note. Would be happy buying full size- lots of compliments when I wear this.

**Honey Jasmine Karma**: Lovely honey scent, very feminine and crazy lasting power (8 hours on me)

**Lemon Sherbet:** Sugary lemon. Delicious and perfect. Can’t buy full size as it is no longer in production which has made me very sad. 

**London Linden:** A very clever scent. I don’t love the smell of Linden blossom but this scent is exactly it followed by petrichor followed by a lovey floral dry down. Not for me but I recognise the genius that has gone into it- you feel like you’re walking down a hot street with linden blossom, then it rains and then the sun comes back out. 

**Mother Nature’s Naughty Daughters**: powdery rose jam- reminds me of Delina exclusif. Staying power is forever. Powder is on the cute side- no old lady here. 

**No Mow May:** Green amber floral. Another genius scent but not quite wearable for me. I love it because it makes me feel like I’m a child in the countryside once more, surrounded by flowers but I can also smell hay in the barn and something lovely is cooking on the stove whilst herbs dry in the kitchen. I wont wear in public but enjoy it in private when I want to think of happier times. 

**Over the Chocolate Shop**: Dry cocoa and coffee, delicious, cosy. Makes me so happy. Would buy a mini to spray on cold days in the office.

**Pillow Talk**: My favourite, juicy fruit and pink pepper followed by white chocolate vanilla. Reminds me of Nuit et confidences by Anika Goutal but way prettier. Would buy full size although longevity is not great. 

**Rhubarb and custard 1:29**: savoury rhubarb, not much custard. Didn’t love it but I do like my gourmands sweet. 

**Skin**: Says 5 musks, beeswax, rice and cacao but all I smelt was patchouli. I like patchouli but not many people do so, not sure if wearable for me. 

**The Sexiest Scent on the planet(IMO):**  Bergamot and vanilla with some musk. Not so much sexy but an easy people-pleaser with good lasting power. 

**Temptation**: Originally the base for another perfume this is a holy grail vanilla for me. No play doh and no gourmand but amber and musk making a salty vanilla skin scent. It’s absolutely beautiful, simple and long lasting so I will hopefully get a full size. 

**White Queen**: Website says Creamy gourmand with hazelnut, raspberry, incense, labdanum and musk. Dry down is nice and nutty and cosy but for a few hours the incense over powers everything and you can’t easily get to the other parts. I don’t get any cream. I think this needs to rest for a few months and then I’ll try again.

They dated for about 2 years and broke up amicably before we met. I trust him completely, but I'm struggling with some of my own insecurities about their friendship. They text regularly, grab coffee occasionally, and she's part of his main friend group, so she's often at group hangouts I attend. She's actually really nice, and I can see why they're friends. My boyfriend is always transparent about when they talk or hang out, and he's never given me a reason to doubt him. The issue is entirely on my end - I sometimes feel weird about their history and worry I'm being compared to her, especially since they share so many inside jokes and memories. I don't want to ask him to limit the friendship because that feels unfair and controlling, but I also don't know how to work through these feelings

I've tried talking to friends about it, but they're split - some say it's normal to feel uncomfortable, others say I need to just get over it. I'm worried that if I don't address these feelings now, they'll grow into resentment or cause problems down the line.

Has anyone else dealt with something similar? How did you handle the insecurity while still respecting your partner's friendships? I want to grow from this rather than let it become a bigger issue.

Some guys really can’t handle a simple “no.” I met this one guy twice for coffee just casual meet-ups, but I didn’t feel the vibe and told him honestly that I wasn’t interested. I thought that was the end of it, but he just couldn’t accept it. 
Instead, he went full psycho and actually sent an selfie of us to my brother through email, thinking that would somehow make me come back to him. Like, seriously? It’s scary how some men think they’re entitled to your time or affection, and when they don’t get it, they try weird, manipulative stuff. What is actually wrong with some of them? 
 It was literally stressful for me , like what was my fault , just because i went to date with him , he had rights on me?. Girls be careful please enquire before you meet any guy. ",12,1752916478.0,TwentiesIndia,7,0.93,False
1m3rtwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/davidlynch/comments/1m3rtwb/a_dream_involving_david_lynch/,A dream involving David Lynch,"I dreamt I was in a relationship with David Lynch, or rather we were in this polyamorous 3 way with this rather lovely raven haired woman, she looked a bit like Catherine Zeta-Jones, but we were definitely dating each other to, somewhat romantically but probably not sexually (""no homo"" the dream) we would go to museums and events together, things like that, one day we were going back from event, I was going to go back to one of their houses for a quick drink or a coffee and a chat or something but suddenly realised that it was (shock horror) passed twelve, midnight, and so I couldn't do it and had to stay on the tube instead of getting off with them (getting off at that stop I mean) so I kissed them both goodbye, they left the train and I stayed on. 
(This dream is set in the UK, the tube is  underground rail/metro system)
One day I need to drive the woman that for short I will just call Catherine, I need to drive her somewhere, perhaps it's to meet David, I'm not sure, I insist on doing it via a particular town or maybe it was even a specific service station, it would be a big of detour so I had to come up with some reason why we needed to do it via there, though I actually had an ulterior motive of some sort (and can now no longer remember either the fake reason or the real one) in any case the though I have a car I do not have a driving licence and consequently I am not the best driver, we are going down a rain slick country, road, it's big enough for two lanes of traffic but only just, and it's lines on both sides with over hanging trees and the road surfice is also not up to much, What's more it's considerably more busy than the average country road, this is obviously a nightmare for me as in just about any other circumstances I would probably drive ok but in this one I'm just not going to be able to, on two separate occasions I have to dodge debris, on the first occasion I end up quickly swerving into on coming traffic, I know this is bad but I feel like I have no other choice (I could have stopped the car and got out and moved it but I really felt the need to be in constant motion) none the less I get away with this with nothing worse than some honking horns, however on the second occasion there is nowhere to swerve and I panic and end up crashing into another car. Before long  there are police on the scene, I have explained things to Catherine and manage to convince her to say that this was a driving lesson, perhaps I have a provisional license that allows this (they are for learners and are I think easy to obtain) so I am able to avoid being outright arrested, I am however forced to do a special formal driving course, this is fine, but when I get there it's like some sort of game show, and the host is a priest.
The whole atmosphere of the thing I weird, everything is extremely ambiguous, I basically think that I didn't really sign up to this and decide to be a bit rebellious and the priest/game show host affects a kindly and tolerant disposition towards me but there is an undercurrent of slight sadistic playfulness to him, ultimately though I do kinda rather like him, I am being a brat and kinda enjoying it.
I really have no idea what happened, I don't know what lessons I had, I don't know what gameshow stuff happened, I don't even think I just forgot it, I think it just wasn't in the dream. In any case things end with me being handed a letter with my results on it, it's in an envelope but I decide that it's probably bad so I tear it up into tiny pieces and smile, the priest opens the front door, it's the front door of my house, we are in my house now, I am Infront of the mirror in the hallway and the priest is in the mirror, I am made to go out into the rain soaked streets by some force. I am on the street with someone who may be either Jim Davidson (an old and not very funny comedian who despite his material being primarily ""blue"" somehow during my childhood he was all over primetime TV) or 
Paul Gascoigne (a footbaler as well known for his mental health issues as he was for his sporting prowess) and for some reason me and this ambiguous and or possibly emalgumated figure play in the rain, we play with toy cars on the rain slick ground. Eventually I am let back in, I look back out and ""the figure"" is still there, lying on his side in the wet, playing with the toys, I wave to him and he waves back, I go back in and the door closes, I am told that I have one final test and then I will be allowed to go (I'm not sure whether this will give me my license or not) it is implied that the test will be especially arduous perhaps to make up for me failing some of the others, I am given a cigarette to prepare myself and calm my nerves, I take a few puff and then realise I don't smoke and don't want to smoke, I snuff it out and I'm think maybe I should save it for later where I can smoke it like a cigar of celebration, but it keeps on smoking and smoldering so I snuff it again and again and again it never stops and the dream ends before any further test was given.",0,1752916443.0,davidlynch,7,0.23,False
1m3rtsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m3rtsd/is_my_28f_husband_31m_gaslighting_me/,Is my (28F) husband (31M) gaslighting me?,"I have never posted on reddit before, just enjoyed reading/listening to them and giving my opinion. I guess it is my turn to receive your opinion. 

A little background:

I met my husband when I was 16 and he was 19. We have been together for 12 years and have 2 small children. Over the course of those years on numerous occasions I have thought about leaving but was always afraid. I grew up in a very chaotic home full of DV, drugs, emotional abuse/neglect, physical neglect and moved A LOT (I have more than 12 schools on my transcript) My husband is very aware of my upbringing. My husband also grew up with some trauma. His parents separated when he was 15/16, moved when he was little but lived in that same house the rest of his life until he moved out on his own, his older brother was the main source of his trauma, and he was bounced back and forth between home school and public school. He also grew up going to church multiple times a week. I remember going to church a few times. We both didn't get an easy start to life. I tell you this so you can understand both of our sides more. 

So here are the examples I need to know if he is gaslighting, emotionally abusive, etc or if it is me.

1. I moved in with him right after I turned 18. About a year into us living together I find out that he was texting his ex he had right before me. He hid it from me but eventually told me about it and I told him okay. I snooped and looked at the messages and multiple times the ex asked him if I was okay with them talking and he replied yes even before he told me about it. About a week later I told him I was not okay with it and they stopped talking. As far as I know they haven't talked since. 

2. He had a huge addiction to porn and knows I view that the same as cheating. At times I would go through his search history and see if he has watched porn and when I would casually ask if he has he would lie to me. He then started to hide it from me by using the incognito tab. I got to the point where I would let him record me so he had that to watch instead even though I hate it. He knows I don't enjoy it but do it for him. He also hadn't offered to stop after he knew I don't enjoy it. He says he hadn't watched porn since then. 

3. He often will tell me that I have said or done things that are so out of character for me that it doesn't make sense. When I will tell him that doesn't sound like something I would do or say he always chuckles and laughs and tells me I am the one with the bad memory. Granted I do have poor memory due to trauma and undiagnosed adhd. And recently he has been getting upset if I call him out on it or if I don't believe him. 

4. When I express my concerns or what's bothering me in our relationship he will always start crying and changing the conversation to him and his childhood. Then will ask me what he can do to be better because I ""deserve better"" so I will tell him. Things will be good for no more than 2 weeks then he goes back to how he was like our conversation never happened. I will ask him what I can improve on and 99% of the time he tells me nothing. Then I feel like all I do is complain and feel guilty. 

5. I struggled with opening up about my feelings and would often dissociate. The best way to describe it would be my mind would go literal white like a white wall and I couldn't get my mouth to move. Sometimes it took me about 24 hours after to finally be able to talk to him about it. This would upset him because he wanted to know what was wrong so he could ""fix it"". He would pressure me to open up to him. With years of practice (or forcing myself) I can now tell him what is going on within a few hours. Because of this and number 4 I find myself pushing my feelings down to avoid arguments with him or the constant disappointment. 

6. I usually sleep in on the weekends because I work at night while he watches the kids. Our kids would wake up around 7am and I would wake up between 9-10am. For months when I woke up the kids weren't fed and were already hangry (if you have kids you know). I am obviously annoyed because of it. He will tell me he didn't feed them because they said they weren't hungry. I have told him so many times to just make them breakfast and give it to them - not to ask if the are hungry. They are 6 and younger of course they don't want to stop watching TV to eat or think about what they want to eat.

One morning he and our son went to the store and left my daughter who is 6 unsupervised while I was asleep. He didn't wake me up to tell me he was leaving, didn't text me, he took my vehicle and his truck keys, and she wasn't fed. From the time I woke up to when he got back he was gone for 30 minutes. He said he went to 2 car part stores, a garage sale and coffee shop all within the 30 minutes. I call bs. He gets upset with me for being mad at him. Never apologizes for leaving her unsupervised.

7. We lost the kids ssn cards after opening them a bank account and I was panicked. I told him about it and he didn't seem phased at all or even help me find them. A few months go by and they magically appear in my top dresser drawer. I only use my dresser for clothes and know for certain I would have put the cards back in their safe spot that they were before we went to the bank. When I told him where I found them he chuckled and said he didn't do it so it must have been me while still smiling. I was so upset he found that funny. It still doesn't make sense when he uses his top drawer to keep things. That evening he told me sorry and he must have put them there and didn't remember. It felt like a fake ass apology to get me to stop being upset. 

8. He will frequently jokingly me I am stuck with him forever and if I ever try to leave he will lock me in a closet. He also tells our kids they will never have step parents because mommy and daddy will never get divorced. 

9. I am wanting to start an in home daycare. For the first year I plan on working my current job while doing the daycare so I can focus on paying off debt quickly. My husband will casually tell me he thinks I should quit my current job and not do both even though he knows why I want to do both for a year. 

10. I have told him multiple times what my love language is and I love to be romanced and how that looks for me. He tells me he isn't romantic, it doesn't come naturally for him, he doesn't know how, or his parents weren't romantic. I think it shouldn't be a chore if you truly love the person you will pick up on the ways they feel loved. I have even told him exactly what he should do. 

11. I often wish he would cheat on me so I had an excuse to leave


That's everything I could think of for now. I know the answer is more than likely to get divorced. I am just worried how that will look like with 2 small kids. I have been trying so hard to give them a childhood they don't have to heal from and it breaks my heart that I might not be able to do that. I have also contemplated staying until the kids are adults then divorcing but I am worried that wouldn't be healthy for them either.

I (26F) just got out of a long term relationship 3 months ago and she was CRUEL. After taking some time to myself, I decided to try dating app. We are both girls. So this new person I’m talking to is a girl as well. 

Mind you, I look decent but I’m seldom girls’ first choice because I’m only 5 ft. I matched this girl who is dead serious and she is not playing games from the way she interrogated and talked to me. But she is super dense. I almost gave up initially until she downloaded a social chat app that is commonly used in my country to chat with me because that’s the only app that I uses and she said she didn’t want to miss any of my texts on the dating app since she doesn’t have notifications there. I found it cute so I decided to continue talking to her. We are very similar in terms of background. So conversation naturally flows for about a week and as someone who is extremely picky, I found her really intriguing and really want to get to know her more. 

I know that chatting online means nothing and I really want to ask her out. Our chat has been going well in text so I figured why not as I have nothing to lose. This is after she told me that she’s tired of the app already and asked me what I think about her. I texted her a link of an Italian restaurant yesterday and said “let’s go and have this” but the only answer I got was “but it’s so far” and then she proceed to tell me she will be busy at night with some school project so she can’t really text me. Today, I tried using a different way by saying “If I guess your blah blah right, how about I buy you a cup of coffee and maybe something to eat?” and she responded by saying “hmmm? How does that work?”. I got slightly off putted so I just said “I’M TRYNA ASK YOU OUT” and “JEEZUZ”. 

Is this a sign of no interest or something because I REALLY WANT TO GET TO KNOW HER BETTER AND THE BEST WAY IS BY MEETING OFFLINE IMO. ",1,1752916044.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I plugged in a charger one time and when I used it again the lights in the living room and kitchen went out. One outlet in the kitchen doesn't work anymore bc of roaches. I've had them ruin my microwave, toaster, coffee maker, all need replacing. I've had 200 power bills bc the ac and heat haven't worked properly since day one and aren't efficient. I had to fight them for 6 months to replace my back door (in my bedroom!) which had plastic in the window panes instead of glass. Had to fight them for an entire day to come check if their was a coolant leak which ended up being the awful smell from the neighbor upstairs doing nails. Had to fight them constantly to give notice to enter my unit so that I had time to put away my sons and my medications totaling over 1,000 dollars monthly. Idiot maintenence and 3 of their vendors also left my door unlocked a total of 4 separate occasions and the maintence left the key to their office door in the lock, UNLOCKED, where tenants drop rent checks. Can't make this shit up. Have video evidence of that too. I complained on the owners of a building next to us illegally burning trash 2 feet from the building the next day someone put glue in our locks.

Dominic Ryder x Charlie Morningstar or Ashbelle.[OC]","Coloring is sloppy, and not the best I know sorry if it sucks. Trying to get better at drawing and such, my creativity isn't the best tho. Wish I had a digital tablet to draw on. Maybe one day. :)

Anyways yeah, here's some cheesy romance and kissing. Because...**I like fluff.**

Anyways, reason Dominic's hair is blue, and flaming is actually a part of his character.

When he's usually having **the sex**, his dark brown, floofy curly yet wavy hair, turns into blue holy flames, because of him being cursed with a Archangel, him and Zarathos are kinda intertwined in a way, basically two souls living in one body and or vessel.

Along with his hair flaming, his sclera turns pitch black, with a blue flames as a pupil, his fingers also become more skeletal. This only happens during, when he is very happy, or having the sex with Charlie, who definitely goes into her full demon form when having **THE SEX**. Also his burning love for Charlie and Vaggie make him become this way. His tongue also becomes longer, and forked, Venom-like and flaming, blue. (We all know what he does with that tongue 😏) oh and spikes come out of his body, and chains... yeaaaah.

When Dominic isn't happy, his hair starts flaming orange, yellow and red basically Hellfire, his sclera turns black, but his pupils are burning orange flames, sometimes his eyes are skull eye sockets. Like burning embers. Or sometimes just pitch black. 

Yes Charlie tops. ;).

He is kinda like Billy Butcher in ways, being a menace and taking a bunch of things WAY too far at times. Such as when a spider came into him, Charlie and Vaggie's shared room, and he unloaded a clip into that thing, because ""it looked racist and sentient"". He also nearly beat the shit out of Valentino because he licked Charlie, (for plot reasons Valentino did not get a Penance Stare.)

Hey Gwalior Redditors! 👋🏼

Any comments or inputs are highly appreciated.

I’m planning to start a small takeaway coffee kiosk here in Gwalior that offers premium coffee (hot & cold) made from a variety of beans, along with freshly baked croissants and a few exotic items on the menu — think affogato, cold brews, flavored lattes, and maybe some gourmet dessert pairings. The idea is to bring café-level quality in a quick-stop format, without the wait or the crowd.

And here’s the twist — you’ll be able to enjoy it all from the comfort of your car, with your order hand-delivered to your window. No parking hassles, no long queues — just good coffee, fast.

📍Potential Locations I’m Considering:
1. Below Anytime Fitness
2. In front of 22 Street Kitchen
3. Outside DD Mall
4. In front of Street Food Zudio
5. Beside Shahi Darbar

🧠 Would love your input on a few things:
1. Would you visit a kiosk like this regularly?
2. How much would you be willing to spend for a premium coffee and croissant/snack combo? (e.g., ₹80? ₹120? ₹180?)
3. Any menu suggestions or unique ideas you’d like to see?
4. What do you think of the above locations — and do you have better ones in mind?

My goal is to create something fresh, convenient, and actually worth your time and money — so please drop your thoughts, critiques, or wishlist items. Your feedback will really shape how this comes to life. 🙏🏼

You can find the images for reference on my profile.

Thanks in advance!

This, seriously speaking, is my experience. But it's horrible quality. You'll gain nothing but written entertainment from reading it. This is a very long post. You've been warned. I tried to keep this as accurate as I remember. Some stuff I don't precisely remember was compromised with words describing what I felt then.

[**Edited: Fixed some inaccuracies**]

How do I begin?

>I decided to split various phases of my actions with ellipses (...). First-person thoughts are shown with the Reddit quote mode, and (second-person?) thoughts are in the text body.

...

I first tried to understand the game.

I went through the tips in the game. I chose to be a fixer. It showed how to adjust various aspects of the level. Then I tried changing the first setting for adjusting the difficulty, then I realized I forgot what the setting meant. I just read its tutorial 20 seconds ago.

>Note: I'm a college student, 21 credits through a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering, with a cGPA of `3.92/4.00`. Precalculus and Calculus 1 were not hard.

...

I decided that I understood enough since the tutorial turned off and it highlighted the (co-op?) button. So I clicked it, and it went into matchmaking mode. I was confused. Like, is it fine to dive straight into a co-op game being an absolute beginner?

>Well, the game tutorial guided me to this. So, I guess it's fine.

I clicked the button and waited. It seemed like the game was searching for a third player? I don't even know how many players are in a party. Eventually, nothing happened. It stopped matchmaking.

Then the session just sat there, paused. I thought the game was doing something. I waited. Nothing. I was confused again.

*notices the text ""Ready"" and ""Not Ready.""*

>Oh.

*selects ""Ready.""*

Then the game started loading and then it froze. I thought it would recover. I waited for a full minute. Still frozen. Even the taskbar didn't pop up.

I decided to force shut down my laptop. I felt bad for the guy who was with me, but oh well.

I was kicked out of the party in my second matchmaking session.

>You can do that????

Third matchmaking was successful.

>Note: I did not modify my loadout as I trusted the game's defaults.

Then I successfully entered the game with no freezes (a few freezes for a few seconds maybe).

>Note: These freezes lasted only till here. Rest of the game was a smooth 60+ FPS average on low settings

So I spawned. What do I do? idk. I tried to look for something in my HUD that indicated a goal. I didn't find anything obvious. I saw my teammates just standing around doing nothing. Well, I'm off.

Outside my spawn room stood a guy with a gun, swaying like a drunk. He had a kinda red outline. He did nothing for a few seconds. I ignored him, thinking he was some random guard, and ran. I was shot.

>WTF?

I shot him. At least I attempted to. My main weapon was some weird shit that only flickered some electricity. At the time of writing, I still don't know what it does. I somehow figured out how to change to my revolver and shot him.

I saw some other drunkards. I realized they were some kind of zombies, so I rained bullets on them. I wasted a lot but didn't mind, thinking I had infinite bullets.

>Note: I do remember the mobs being introduced in the beginning cutscene. But I was unfamiliar with their behavior. The beginning cutscene explained... pretty much nothing about how they behave. The behaviour shown in the cutscene looked like comical idiocy and so, I disregarded it. It didn't say what they really look like outside of a simplified drawing. Hell, I even forgot what they were called. Fireblazer? Firebreaker? Isn't that us? Whatevs, I'll refer to them as zombies for now.

I continued wandering around, searching for a goal and killing zombies. I ran out of bullets. idk what to do. I got knocked down. idk wtf I should do. I see a force respawn or something button and I use it.

*enters spectator mode*

*waits to spawn*

*nothing else happens*

*sees respawn button and uses it to respawn*

*respawns with revolver locked and loaded*

*goes out and attacks more zombies*

*cycle 2x*

I tried attacking with my useless main weapon several times.

I decided to stick with my teammates. I regrouped and attacked the zombies with them. I still didn't know what the goal was. I ran out of bullets again. I decided to kill myself. I wondered how. I opened the menu and saw force respawn. I attempted to do so. Somehow in the middle, I got knocked down again. idk how but I was happy. Then my teammate attempted to revive me.

>NO, YOU FOOL. I'M TRYING TO KILL MYSELF TO RELOAD.

I was revived. I went to some corner and committed suicide. Once again, I regrouped with my *trusty* teammates.

At some point, I saw a diamond pointer that seemed like it wanted me to go there. I also saw a sentence indicating the goal on my HUD. So I did. My teammates were lagging behind. I'm off again. We regrouped at the target location.

I saw some kind of fire hydrant that was next to the target. It was leaking water and flickering electricity. Me being the fixer, tried to fix it. I couldn't. I tried pointing my ""electricity creating"" main weapon at it. I clicked all sorts of buttons. Nothing happened.

I didn't know what to do. I don't know what we did. After a while, a ton of zombies spawned and it was attack time. The diamond pointer and the sentence explaining the goal had both disappeared. I was, once again, a man without a goal. I stuck to my *trusty* teammates.

After a while, they went to a room that looked like the spawn area. There, I saw them draining water down the sink. I was confused. Then I did as they did. I saw my health bar going up. I realized that it was a water level bar. I decided to also think of it as my health bar.

After the drink, I wandered around the room looking for ammo. I mysteriously found some. Wondering whether I'm fully reloaded or not, I left the room.

After some time, another goal sentence and a diamond pointer appeared. My teammates were lagging behind again. I went off on my own again. Halfway through, I turned back, worried about my crew.

I found one of them being chased by a horde. I shot the horde.

>Shit, I shot my teammate.

I thought my brother in idiocy was a zombie. I didn't even know friendly fire was allowed. We ignored what happened (we couldn't talk to each other anyway. idk how), and attacked the horde.

We all regrouped and reached the target location, an elevator. Nothing happened. Some more zombies spawned. Killed, still no improvements.

Later, I opened the elevator, I think. Actually, we did some random shit and there was a warning of some sort of explosion. I ran, fearing for my health. One bozo stood right next to it. He didn't die.

The elevator opened. We went in. I waited for more zombies and for the others to prompt the elevator to move. Nothing happened. I turned around, saw a lever. I tried pulling it, wondering why these idiots didn't. It was broken.

It's fixer time ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Me, still struggling with the controls and the instructions, tried fixing it, fixed it, broke it (I think), fixed it, pulled it down, pulled it up, and pulled it back down. More zombies spawn. We attack as the elevator closes.

Mission accomplished

...

I am using the Game Pass free trial. I was testing various games to see if they were fun. And if they were, I'd buy them after the free trial ends. That's how I found this game. I only watched some gameplay footage. I didn't read any reviews before playing.

It is a fun game despite me not knowing a lot of things about it. I thought I'd buy it when it gets at least 50% off on a sale. I don't mind waiting for it. Then I thought about how long I could play it. Completion time?

>That question doesn't make sense. Isn't co-op in this like the competitive mode in CS:GO?

I was wrong. It's fine tho. Then I looked for the reviews of the game just to check. I also noticed that it was just released a month ago. This guaranteed I should wait for a year before buying. I based this decision on my personal beliefs about good games. I decided I'm fine with the game even with all the bad reviews I read.

...

So I looked for a guide on the game.

I looked at the fandom for details on weapons and other stuff. Didn't see much info.

Then I watched a guide on YouTube. But it was actually a video about tips despite being named a guide. I tried searching for another video, then found one named ""FBC Firebreak - The Complete Guide"". I went with this.

I interrupted the YouTube guide as it was time to do my daily chores. I was about to do it, but then I paced around for half an hour, thinking about what just happened. I started to doubt my own sanity. Like, why am I doing this? Usually when I play games, the tutorial gives most of what I need to know to play at a basic level. Here, I didn't even know what my main weapon does.

Then I did an introspection:-

**Physical Health**:

Am I high on drugs?

>No, I don't do drugs.

Am I drunk?

>No, I don't drink alcohol.

Am I high on caffeine?

>No, I didn't and I don't drink that much coffee.

Am I sleep-deprived?

>Not really? I have a light headache? I have a horrible sleep schedule and occasional light headaches are normal to me. Maybe the answer is along those lines?

**Mental Health**:

Am I mentally sound?

>Usually.

What was my most stressful experience today?

>It was an event at my relative's house. I was sitting awkwardly in a room filled with people I don't know. For half an hour, I distracted myself with my phone.

What was my most irritating experience today?

>I spent 40 minutes waiting for my order at McDonalds. My brother's order was fresh and piping hot, while mine was cooled down. I didn't know what to say to the staff as I already completed the feedback before I received my order. Completing the feedback gives you a free Americano.

Did I drain my head with something?

>Usually when I study a lot for exams and I am at my peak performance, I have a headache, I feel sleepy, hungry, and am finished off with a raging boner for absolutely no fucking reason. That didn't happen here. Maybe the answer is along those lines?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Cercle Brugge KSV vs. Dender: A Tale of Loyalty, Lopsided Odds, and Last-Minute Drama**

Let’s cut to the chase: This match is as dramatic as a soap opera where the star quarterback transfers to a rival team *and* the main character’s ex shows up at the finale. Here’s the breakdown.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game

The odds for this July 26 clash are a tight race, with **Cercle Brugge KSV** as the slight favorite (decimal odds \~2.25–2.40, translating to **41.7–44.4% implied probability**), while **Dender** sits at \~2.85–2.90 (**34.5–35.1%**) and the draw at \~3.30–3.45 (**29–30.3%**). The spread? A razor-thin -0.25 for Cercle Brugge, meaning you’d need to bet on them to cover a half-goal edge. The total goals line hovers at 2.5, with **Over** slightly favored (odds \~1.68–1.77), suggesting bookmakers expect a spicy, high-scoring affair.

But here’s the kicker: Cercle Brugge just lost **Thibo Somers**, their heartbeat. The local legend, who spent 18 years at the club (from U9 ball boy to first-team hero), departed for Antwerp. His stats? 31 goals, 18 assists in 189 games. His loyalty? Comparable to a golden retriever with a GPS—unshakable. Now, they’re left with a void so big, you could fit a whole Dender squad inside it.

### Digest the News: A Tale of Two Teams

**Cercle Brugge** is reeling from Somers’ exit. As he put it, “I started as a ball boy, sang in the stands, and finally got to play. Now I’m gone.” Imagine your favorite coffee shop closing down and your barista moving to a rival café—only this barista also happened to be your emotional support latte.

Meanwhile, **Dender** is the underdog with nothing to lose. They’re not Club Brugge (who’ve dominated recent derbies, per the article—though let’s not confuse “Brugge” with “Brugge KSV,” because Belgian geography is a迷). Dender’s preparation? Two friendlies against FC Dender (wait, \*themsel

1m3rg0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1m3rg0s/the_honey_of_life_is_joy/,The Honey of Life is Joy,"Benny was the kind of guy you wish you could meet but never do. Everyone has their flaws, everyone gets Angry, everyone lashes out when they're tired, or stressed, or frustrated. But not benny. He was the kind of guy to help the old Lady across the street. He was the kind of guy who would help you move. He was the kind of guy to sit down, listen to all your problems and never complain. He was the kind of guy that, when you bumped into him, would apologise to you. He had the exact opposite of resting Bitch Face. Whenever you saw him, he was always smiling, even when he held a neutral expression his cheeks would curve upwards, he would have a chuckle in his throat, even his eyes seemed to smile somehow. Just seeing him was often enough to brighten your day, it would put a little spring in your step just like he has. He was so nice, it was almost maddening. It seemed unfair, as if God himself had poured all the happiness into him and had nothing left for anyone else. In every way, Benny was the exact opposite of me. 

People who have never experienced depression don't know what it feels like. They think that they can empathize, but they can't. “Everyone gets sad sometimes, so depression is just that, but it lasts longer”. But they're wrong. Depression is not a rainy day; it is as if there is no sky. Depression is when you eat nothing but toast, because even your favorite food seems to turn into ash in your mouth. I wish depression was like being in pain, like a bone you can reset or a disease that you can cure. But all it is, is unending despair. The only time I felt something even approaching happiness, was when I was unconscious, because i didn't have to think. I didn't have to think about who i am, what the purpose of life is, where im going, what i can do. Nothingness is pure bliss to me. That is why people kill themselves, because nothingness is better than constant Hopelessness.  

I had no rational reason to be depressed. I had loving parents, and thanks to them, i was well off. I could choose to do with my life whatever i wanted, i could study at a high-end university, get a well-paying job, buy a house on the Bahamas, get married, have children, make the world a better place. I could become a police officer, an astronaut, a juggler, anything. Yet i didn't care for any of it. Not for family, friends, a job, money or even drugs. I would drink myself to sleep almost every night, not because i liked the feeling of being drunk, but because i simply wanted to shut off my brain as quickly as possible. I wanted it all to stop. But i had a tiny, painful, agonizing sliver of hope left. A hair thin string holding up my entire world, ready to be cut at a Moments notice. That sliver was benny.  

Whatever secret to happiness benny held, i wanted it. Call me selfish if you like, not that i would care, but i just wanted an end to the ongoing pain that was my life, one way or another. It would either be benny, or a sturdy rope.  

Of course, he agreed to meet me. He was benny after all. I offered to pay for the coffee, but he insisted. No complaints from me. I didn't tell him about how i felt, i didn't want a speech about how life was meaningful, you just have to find it for yourself or whatever Platitude he would give me. I've heard it all before and i simply was tired of it. I wanted his secret, there had to be something, something tangible benny did or had that I didn't, that would save me. So, I asked him straight up. Of course, he asked me if everything was alright, if i had financial troubles, all that. I just brushed it off, and he eventually seemed to get the message and stopped digging, as i expected him to. I just wanted to know his secret. How did he do it? How did he get out of bed every morning, beaming with joy, ready to take on any challenge? I was asking the question, expecting him to give me some kind of generic answer, like how it's all about perspective or some ritual he does, or maybe he's just a Mormon or whatever. But I honestly never would have expected the answer he actually gave me. 

“You don't want to know”. 

Despite the fact that he had awakened my curiosity, he refused to elaborate any further. He just laughed like he always does, dodging all my questions. But at least i knew that i was right: He had some kind of secret. Something real, something tangible, something that could actually help me. Maybe. And yet he refused to give it to me, and my anger overtook. How could he be so selfish? He was the kind of person to give you all his money if you asked him, wanting nothing in return. And yet he didn't want to give me to one thing i wanted? That i needed? I Started yelling, screaming even, calling him names and slurs, i begged, I pleaded, i didn't care about the looks we got, I just wanted to have it. But all he did was Politely smile, like he always does, he paid the bill, of course giving a huge tip, wished me the best, and he went on his merry way. As much as i hated him in that moment, at least i got something out of the whole ordeal. I knew that i was right. But i also knew, for whatever reason, he was not willing to give it to me. At least not willingly. 

 

We all like to think of ourselves as good people. That we would help people in need, even at our own detriment. That we would dash into the fire to help the crying child. But we always say that when the fire isn't lit. It is incredible what man can do when he has nothing left to lose, throwing away all notions of morality or justice. And why would i care? So what if i went to prison? So what if I got caught? What could they possibly do to me? I had nothing to Lose, and everything to gain. It wasn't difficult to come up with my plan, it took me only a week.  

Everyone knew that benny was home late every Friday, he always helped out in the soup kitchen and always stayed late to make sure even the last person, no matter how rude, was fed. That is when I would strike. Despite his generosity, he was actually fairly wealthy. I think he won the lottery, or maybe some thankful billionaire gave him a lot of money, I never cared to ask. But his house was quite large, large enough to be noticeable, but no so large as to come off as pretentious. Needless to say, it would take me some time to search every room. There was no need to break in, his front door was unlocked. I almost expected to find some kind of altar, something to offset his personality, but his house seemed remarkably unremarkable. Landscape paintings covering the walls, giving it a peaceful Look. The walls were painted in a soothing blueish hue, the furniture was tasteful wood, handcrafted, possibly even by Benny himself. The stairs were elegantly winding up to the second floor. Thats where i would start. I would search this House from top to Bottom, until i got what i needed. I slowly climbed up the Stairs, each step causing an audible creak on the wooden steps. Despite me knowing full well that i was alone, the noise unnerved me to no end. The first door i opened at the top revealed a bedroom, where he must keep some kind of personal belongings. It was awfully plain, so searching it didnt take much time at all. I expected at least some family portraits or maybe a diary, but nothing. Just clothes and Books, and even those being incredibly unremarkable. The other rooms didnt provide much more, a bathroom with basic necessities, a dressing room with inoffensive clothes, an office without much decoration and just some paperwork. Despite his shining personality, his house showed no sign of anything outrageous, it was all very plain and tidy. 

The first floor was not much different. The kitchen was filled with the standard food you would expect in a normal household. Bread, jam, milk and coffee. Again, nothing peculiar sticking out. The living room was the same, a normal couch, a normal TV, nothing that would, in any way shape or form, indicate some kind of sinister secret. The entire house seemed as normal as normal could be, almost suspiciously so. I searched every corner of every room and could find nothing offensive. No secret lover, no hint of children, no weird fetish, nothing either positive or negative. It felt like a cardboard cutout of a home. Despite it being relatively large, i managed to search every room in a short amount of time, i found nothing, not even a hint to his secret. 

The final door i could check was the hidden space under the Staircase. I knew from my Grandmothers Place that old houses would often have hollowed out spaces under the stairs, usually used for storage or sometimes as a bathroom. In this case it was the former. The Vacuum almost hit me in the face as i swung the door open. I threw it to the side and started emptying the room. Brooms, Mops, old Books and Buckets, even an old coat. But none of it was what i was looking for. When i had removed everything, the storage room was empty and dusty. I thought that that couldn't be it, there had to be something I missed, something hidden. I was glad that I was right.  

As I stepped into the room, searching for maybe a hidden button or switch and heard a very satisfying sound. The floor was creaking, not like the stairs due to age, but more like when you step on a thin plank. There was a hollow space under the floor. It was Covered by an old Persian carpet, but that is nothing a boxcutter couldn't solve. As expected, a trapdoor revealed itself, fortified by several heavy locks. Not only was this the only locked door in the house, but who puts several, industrial Locks on an old trapdoor? This had to be it. This is where the secret is hidden. I came prepared of course, my Bolt cutter made short work of the locks, and the door swung open, throwing a wave of Dust into the Air. Whatever was behind this door, Benny hasn't opened it in a long, long time. The steps Leading downwards were old and rotten, creaking more than any other sound I made in the house. So much so, I feared they would break under my weight. Thankfully they didn't, and a huge, empty room showed itself to me. Well, mostly empty. The entire room was the size of the first floor, and completely unilluminated by any kind of light. I brought out my high-power flashlight, I wanted to be prepared for everything. With a flick of a switch, a huge cone of bright light revealed the full depth of the room. Despite its size, it was suffocatingly empty, save for a small shape at the very back of the room. As I got closer, I could start to make out what it was. An Altar. 

It was an old, thick, wooden, dust covered stand, holding up a plate sized tablet made of stone. I started to think that benny was perhaps a satanist or cultist of some kind. That he had conducted some kind of ritual to summon a demon or a spirit that had possessed him. But what kind of demon makes someone nice? Did he have an Ulterior motive? I brushed it off. I didn't believe in magic, or gods, or the supernatural. I always found it to be superstitious nonsense. I wanted to believe it, maybe it would make me happier, but in my rational Brain I just couldn't accept the supernatural. I thought benny was just another crazy guy, somehow deluding himself through rituals to be the perfect Nice guy. But that was not what this was. 

 

Etched into the Stone Tablet was just a simple phrase. It took up the Space of the Whole Tablet, so it was easy enough to read, although the Calligraphical handwriting made it difficult even so. Quickly I deciphered it, just one Phrase 

“The Honey of Life is Joy”. 

I couldn't have been any more Confused. Was this a mantra? A spell? Maybe a clue to the actual secret? I shone my Flashlight All over it, hoping I had missed something. Maybe a button this time, or at least something that would give me a hint. Bennys Voice startled me and made me swing around as fast as I could. 

“I told you that you don't want to know” 

I shone the flashlight directly into his Face, blinding him. I was expecting him to be angry, to ask me what I was doing here, anything a reasonable human being would do. But he just smiled softly, like a mother who caught their child taking a cookie after being told not to. And like a child I felt embarrassed and flustered. I started stuttering and yammering, trying to come up with some kind of excuse. But all he did was step to the side and say: “I think you should go now. I wanted to ask him what all this was about, why he had this hidden room, why I shouldn't find out about it and most importantly, what that Phrase meant. But something about him, about his demeanor, made me shut up and do as im told. I left the room, benny following closely behind, climbed upwards and came out the same way i came in. As i came out the front door, He said one last thing to me 

“Sweet dreams” 

It chilled me to my bones. Was it a threat? Was he going to kill me? But if he had wanted to, he would have done it while we were down there. Could he even Kill someone? Was he that kind of guy? Was it all a lie? I wanted to ask him, but he just quietly shut the door. I didnt want to push my Luck any further.  

I did arrive home Late, but searching the House didnt take as long as i had thought it would. It was 11:36 pm. All i wanted was to go to sleep. But i was still bothered by Bennys last words. Would something happen to me in my sleep? Or was i maybe overthinking things? Was it just benny being benny? Was he just trying to be nice? Maybe he would call the Police, and they would arrest me in the night. That must be it. It wouldnt really matter either way. There is nothing he could do to me that i wouldnt welcome. So, i just peacefully drifted into sleep. 

Something woke me up later on. A noise perhaps, although i couldn't be sure, since i was still half asleep. I peered over to my clock, 2:00 AM. It was pitch-black outside; the only light was the faint shimmer of the stars shining through my window. I held still, waiting for another noise, but it was all quiet in my house. I fell back into my bed, wanting to drift off again, but then i heard it again, and i knew it was real this time. Tapping. Many, quick, tiny taps, coming and going in intervals. The pauses in-between seemed random, but the taps were always in those quick bursts. I started to hear it more clearly, first it came from the first floor, moving further and closer. Then the stairs, more continuous this time, getting closer. Whatever it was, it was moving up the stairs. I Was paralyzed. It couldnt be the police, right? Humans dont sound like that when they move. Another burst of taps, like a quick drumroll. It was getting louder, closer. I could hear my own breathing. I was trying to suppress the noises i made, but it just pierced through the quiet of my room. Another burst. It came closer yet again, now i could hear it front of my bedroom door. And now i could hear another sound. It was a faint buzzing. It too came and went. Then silence again.  

It must have been only a couple of moments, but it felt like a lifetime. Then i heard the tapping again, this time against the door. Whatever it was, it was right on the outside of my bedroom door. Then i heard the clicking of the doorhandle turning, slowly, ever so slowly, like it hadnt quite figured out how it worked. But eventually it did, the door started to swing open. Ad with it being opened, that... thing... started to come into view. I couldnt quite make out what exactly it was, but it was big. As wide as the door itself and half as tall, it stuck to it like glue. Once the door was fully opened, it stopped moving once again. I was just lying there, staring in horror at that thing stuck to the door. Then it moved again, so much more quickly than i expected it to, it Scuttled off the door, onto the floor and towards me, stopping a couple meters away from my bed. It had legs. Many legs. How many i couldnt make out, but i could hear them tapping on the floor as it moved. It had the rough shape of a huge spider, its long, spindly legs curling upwards and then downwards again. You should never be able to hear an insect move. They shouldnt have that much weight. 

 Another burst of movement. It was right in front of my bed. The buzzing was getting louder and more frequent, and now i knew where it came from. It had wings too. Attached to its thick, hairy, black ball of a body were many insectoid wings, quickly flapping their membrane around like a fly or a bee. They started flapping faster, the buzzing getting louder with them. First its Bulbous body lifted off the ground, the legs still attached to the Floor, until those lifted off as well. It hovered a meter above the ground, around the height of my bed, and started moving towards me. I wanted to scream, i wanted to swat it away, but at the same time i was too disgusted to touch it, too paralyzed by fear to move at all. It sat down at the end of my bed, mere centimeters away from my feet. It stopped moving yet again, instead just staring at me. I couldnt count how many eyes it had, some bigger, some smaller, attached seemingly randomly to its M shaped head. Right below attached two enormous, fuzzy fangs. Its eyes were a pitch black, wetly glistening in the faint light. Even though there was no way for me to tell, i knew it was looking at me.  

I had to run. I had to move. I had to do something. I kicked my feet against it, feeling utterly disgusted when my soles touched its slimy, furry “Face”. I wanted to spring up and run, but it was fast, so much faster than me. In a fraction of a second it crawled on top of me, pinning my arms and legs with its many limbs. It was so heavy, so strong, i squirmed, i buckled, i used more strength than i thought i could possibly have, but i just couldnt move it. Like a stone statue it was on top of me, its pincers on its legs clamping down on me, i could feel the warm blood running down where it pierced my skin. Its face was right above mine, its huge fangs clicking in satisfaction and its eyes staring into my soul. I wanted to scream, but i was too afraid to open my mouth, thinking about God knows what it could put in it. It hindered my breathing, and my struggle became weaker and weaker. It stopped moving, while i kept fighting for my life. Eventually i just gave up, hoping it would kill me rather than... whatever else it might have wanted to do to me. 

 Once i stopped struggling, it started to move its fangs apart, gaping its, i guess you could call it a “mouth”, open. It started buzzing again with its wings in what felt like excitement, like a dog wagging its tail. It was so loud now right in front of me, like a swarm of flies tried to crawl into my ears. I could feel the piss running down my legs. My brain painted me so many, horrifying scenarios. I thought it would scrape my face off my skull, i thought it would tear my limbs off with its strength, i thought it would lay its eggs into my lungs, and once they burst, its many, tiny children would devour me from within. 

But instead... it started crying. Human sounding cries emerged from its face hole. First, it sounded like a baby wailing. Then a cry like a woman as well. A man screaming in pain. More and more cries were added to the chorus of wailing. Louder and louder and louder still, a stadium full of wailing, weeping, moaning and suffocating cries poured down on my, together with its saliva, drenching my chin. Its breath tasted like salt and rotten teeth. It then started to lower its body towards me, its mouth coming closer to my face, the cries getting louder as well. Its fangs clamped the top off my head. Thats when i finally started screaming. I screamed till my lungs started burning, i screamed till i got whoozy, tears streaming down my face, yet it descended towards me with the same pace. Once it was close, i could feel its hairs tickling my forehead, and its maw started enveloping my head. I thought that this would be it. It would eat me alive. I could feel it started to surp on me. And then... darkness.  

 

I Woke up in a trance. I opened my eyes, thinking i might have died. But i was still in my bedroom, unchanged. The light of the sun painted a yellow square on me, warming me gently. Nothing about the room seemed to indicate that what happened last night actually happened. I was drenched in sweat; my throat was still aching and i could smell the sweet and sour reek of dried piss in my bed. But no sign of a spider monster. Even the door was closed again. I started to get up and felt a stinging pain in my limbs. The wounds were still there; the blood was still there. Dried on my arms and legs, but unmistakably blood. Was it a dream? Was it real? If it was a dream, where did the wounds come from? If it was real, where was the monster? Did it just leave? Did it lay its eggs into me after all? 

I wanted to get up and cry after what i experienced last night. I wanted to curse benny, i wanted to storm out the door and confront him, him and his cursed words. But despite what i wanted to feel, i felt only a singular emotion. 

Joy.  

I was happy. I was happier than i have ever been in my entire life. I was smiling from ear to ear. Despite what i really wanted, i had the drive to hug benny. To thank him. The world now seemed brighter, the sun seemed warmer. As i made me a coffee to wake myself up, it tasted sweet. Sweeter than coffee should ever taste. As i put on my shoes, they seemed to fit perfectly, as i opened the door the fresh air felt like the breeze of the ocean. The smells were filling my lungs like a delicious wine, the annoying neighbors felt like family, the bugs were singing me a lullaby as i strode closer to Bennys house. My steps were springy, as if i was weightless, i stopped whenever i could help someone. And once i did, their faces started beaming with a smile as well, as if i was spreading an infectious disease. I had become just like him. I got what i wanted. At a price i wasnt willing to pay. 

I still wanted my answers. I wanted to know what he did to me, how he did it. What was that thing? I wanted to hate him, for the terror i experienced, but even that seemed as distant as a star. I Could feel nothing but love towards him, just like i did towards everyone else. I wanted to scream, but once i opened my mouth, only laughter escaped. I needed an explanation.  

But benny wasnt home. Ringing the doorbell did nohing, no noise came from within the house, and he would never not answer the door. Despite me knowing full well the door was unlocked, it was far too rude to just break in. I rang the door of the Neighbor instead. A sweet, short old lady answered, and she seemed overjoyed to see me, like i was a long-lost son. She invited me in for cookies and tea, me being unable to refuse. We talked about her life, about how her sons rarely visit and her husband has been gone for a long time. I felt pity for her and promised to visit her again next week. I was even planning on bringing her a cake, homemade of course. I remembered the delicious apple pie my mother used to make. I must still have the recipe at home. I had long forgotten my original reason for ringing the doorbell, until Mrs. Weathers asked me why i had. I asked about benny, assuring her that i was an old friend and i wanted to visit him. It pained me deeply to lie to her like that.  

Apparently, he was on his regular Saturday Walk to the graveyard. She had met him there visiting her husband's grave, and they had talked for hours just like we had. He enjoyed the nature and the quiet there, so would often take long walks around. Mrs. Weathers directed me towards it; it was only a ten-minute walk and even told me where Mr. Weathers grave was. I would most likely find him near there, since that is where the most flowers bloomed. Thanking her profusely and apologizing for having to leave so early, i made my way towards the graveyard, of course not without accepting the Cookies she had made for me. Chocolate chip. They were delicious. 

Perhaps it was a ten-Minute Walk for Mrs. Weathers, but for me i arrived far more quickly, even finding the spot she mentioned wasn't very difficult, since the colorful flowers could be spotted from far away. Once i got closer, i could make out the silhouette of a man. It must be benny. I started approaching him behind, confirming quickly that it was him. Once i was almost directly behind him, i started noticing that he was standing in front of a grave.  

It was a wonderful grave, made of pale white stone, fresh flowers potted all around it. In golden letters a name was engraved into it. “In loving memory of Amanda Teino, Daughter, Wife and forever missed”. I noticed that she had the same last name as benny. His wife, perhaps? He must have been grieving her, his shoulders twitching up and down as if crying. Thats what i thought at least, until i heard the sound he made. He wasnt crying, he was laughing. Chuckling.  

He must have realized that i was behind him, since he turned around, revealing his ubiquitous smile.

I've been experimenting with a few methods to reclaim some deep work time and found a simple framework that's been highly effective. I thought I'd share it here in case it's useful to others.

It’s called the 90-Minute Focus Block.

The core idea is to work in intense, 90-minute sprints on a single task, followed by a proper break. Here's the process:

1. **Define ONE Task:** Pick the single most important thing that will move the needle. Not ""do marketing,"" but ""draft five headlines for the new ad campaign."" Be specific.
2. **Set a 90-Min Timer:** A hard, non-negotiable deadline.
3. **Go Dark:** This is the most important part. Phone silent and out of sight. Close all irrelevant tabs, especially email and Slack.
4. **Single-Task:** Work only on that one thing until the timer goes off.
5. **Mandatory Rest:** Take a 20-30 minute break *away* from your desk. Walk around, get a coffee, etc. This is essential for recovery.

Executing just one of these a day has replaced hours of fragmented work for me.

I wrote this up in more detail with a bit more of the 'why' behind it on a new blog I'm starting for this kind of thing:[https://thefoundersfulcrum.beehiiv.com/p/steal-back-3-hours-this-week](https://thefoundersfulcrum.beehiiv.com/p/steal-back-3-hours-this-week)

Current coffee equipment : Aeropress Go with prison attachment , Timemore French press, Bialetti Moka Pot
Accessories: 200 Rs Weighing scale, 200 rs baking thermometer, no kettles at all
Grinder: Chestnut C2

Looking to add to my collection and currently eyeing

For Pour overs: confused between the V60, The V60 plastic kit, or the Hario switch.
Which one of the three seems best or should I just pick a chemex?

Weighing scale: is hoffen one for 1100 enough or should I just pick the Timemore scale? Okay to spend that much

Kettle: electric ones feel too pricy to me rn, Thinking to get Sipologie one for 1500, or maybe the Benki one. Good enough or better options available?

Grinder: saw lots of c3s in the sub, is that a worthy upgrade over the C2 or should I wait till I can get much better?

1m3rf4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThirtiesIndia/comments/1m3rf4g/35_divorces_are_so_tough/,"35, Divorces are so tough!","This morning, my soon-to-be ex-wife came home to pack the last of her things. Our divorce is going to be finalized in one or two months. We were sitting on the sofa and, perhaps had coffee together for the last time.

She then opened her laptop and began working on something, there was strange loud silence in the room. I sensed she wanted to say something, but was holding herself back. I pretended to be busy working on something while sipping my coffee and drifting into my own thoughts.

She looked so beautiful and calm today. I couldn’t help but steal glances at her as she typed. Her fingers moved gracefully over the keyboard, her other hand cradling the coffee cup. I watched her hands and thought to myself, I’ll never get to hold them or to kiss them ever again.

We didn't have a happy fulfilling marriage, but it wasn't toxic either. Somehow we never fought about anything, there were no conflicts between us just an eerie silence and understanding that we aren't compatible to each other, we were husband-wife but could never be partners together, even now I can't exactly pinpoint what happened between us that didn't work out, we were never comfortable together in our silence, we never were emotionally naked with each other together.

 Before filing for divorce we had our fair share of discussions about where our marriage was heading.  It was better to let each other go than to compromise on something and resent each other later. 

But sometimes I wish what if I had compromised more? What if I hadn’t changed my mind about having kids? What if she had adjusted just a little? There were lot of what-ifs spinning in my mind, but I convinced myself that we never meant to be together so better to cut losses early and part ways than to force something and grow resentful. 

She packed her things. As she prepared to leave the home we had shared, I hoped she would say whatever it was that had been sitting on the edge of her tongue all morning. But she didn’t. She just hugged me gently, told me to take care, and left.

I was still packing some of my stuff when I got a phone notification.
For a second my heartbeat dropped, I thought it might be her.
But it was a reminder that read:

*“ABC’s periods gonna come soon, you keep calm and better not fight with her.”*

It was a monthly reminder I had set for her periods a while ago, back when she used to get on my nerves during her periods.
 
I took a screenshot immediately and sent it to her. She replied back shortly :

*""Haha, no one’s gonna get on your nerves from now.""*
I replied jokingly: *""haha Thank God.""*

But I wish she had gotten on my nerves. I wish we had fought. Maybe if we had fought with each other, we might have fought for each other too.

Anyway, life moves on.

Today, I'm feeling absolutely terrible after I met her, there’s grief and strange kind of mourning for a failed marriage. But in the middle of all that, I’m grateful that, even for a short time, I got to be married to her - even if I couldn’t hold it forever.

I was finish cleaning my room and did some handy work, raising up my serotonin and dopamine levels. Then I went to relax for a bit by looking at some Stories of people I follow on Instagram. Then I saw her recent story and replied which led into a normal conversation…you know Reconnecting after so long. The conversation was very weird but good but I said to her “I hope everything is going well with you. We should talk about it sometime.”
Which I thought was like a normal thing to say to someone who you haven’t spoken in like over 7 months. she begins saying that she hoped for the same as well for me but then she said that I was really sweet but isn’t comfortable hanging out with most guys(which is kinda weird because I’ll explain in a bit) but she mostly hangs around with her girlfriends and I was like “yea that’s fine but I didn’t imply hanging out like we used to before. I meant knowing what been going on with you through text?”(which in my defense, kinda gave me a ick but not a bad ick just like a weird feeling) then she said sure, then when back to a normal conversation about shows.

OKAY…now for some Context for you guys 👍
I met this girl at an event in my college two years ago. me and my classmates were getting out of our biology class when we stumbled upon our front lobby of the campus being overrun with an event. We decided to enter then this nice lady told to us as we were signing in “You know I met my husband in events like when I was in college…these types of events could possibly find your future soulmate.” I laughed at that and me and my classmates entered while we were just sitting at a desk playing Uno and connect 4. Then she came in, and not to be like romantic or anything, but it felt like when I saw her Sparks flashed before my eyes(Scott Pilgrim takes off reference btw lol) she asks if she can join us at our table and I said sure and usually as a guy I would let the girl talk first and break the eyes, but this time was different. I broke the ice first, and while my two other classmates were just looking at both of us. I was just very talkative with this person and I felt something. But at this time, I was still going through a break up with my ex at the time which was very toxic and was over here falling over a girl really quickly so I made the decision to keep my feelings to myself and get to know her more and I did…sorta. We started to text often getting to know each other like Whats her favorite color and everything that we do and it just started as normal conversations about a lot of stuff and this was at the time where Jungkook release his album by the way, this is for real good context because it pretty much symbolized my feelings for this person especially the song, Yes or no lol. We started to hang out not constantly but once in a while and this is where I think it was weird when she said that message because we hanged out 4 different times and it was just usually to get coffee and food and just talk about everything that’s been going on with our lives. She told me that she’s very secretive about certain things and I didn’t push anything. I respected her boundaries especially when she told me that she was very family orientated and has a small circle of friends because I am like that as well and I was keeping my feelings at Bay. All of a sudden silence, we didn’t text each other for a rather long time. I became rather obsessed. I’m not gonna lie to you at a point but stopped because it was really unhealthy for me and my feelings for her just starts to fade naturally until yesterday.

You’re probably wondering, am I gonna say some hateful things about her? Am I gonna be like an incel here? My answer to you is no because I genuinely respect this girl, and I respect her decision for saying that because this point my feelings for her is more like a friend rather than a crush. And in my opinion, I think she already has a boyfriend at the time I had a crush on her. And how I found out, was through Instagram Friends reels(Thank you instagram for showing people’s true colors 👌) but yeah, I’m not gonna say anything bad about her because she is one of the most beautiful smarts very kind hearted people I know. she probably has a dark side maybe idk but I feel happy for her and her future endeavors and yes, it hurts that I did have a crush on her and didn’t tell her because didn’t wanna ruin the relationship that I was trying to build with her as a friend but part about being an adult is growing up crushes come and go and maybe she was the one for me, but I know that there’s many different girls out there for me and I’m OK with that. I am still weirded out from the message that she sent me, but I honestly don’t even care to be honest. It just seems really weird because we hang out a lot, but I respect her decision.",2,1752914392.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1m3rbjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1m3rbjq/what_are_the_best_coffee_tables_for_sectionals/,What are the best coffee tables for sectionals and L-shaped sofas?,"After spending countless hours researching and testing different coffee tables for my L-shaped sectional, I've finally found some amazing options that I want to share with everyone here.

I recently moved into a new apartment and struggled to find the perfect coffee table that would complement my large sectional sofa. The main challenge was finding something that provided enough surface area while maintaining good flow around the furniture.

I discovered that rectangular and oval coffee tables work best with sectionals, especially if they're properly sized. For my L-shaped sofa, I found that a table about 2/3 the length of the main sofa section created the perfect balance.

The material choice also matters significantly. Glass tops can make your space feel larger, while wooden tables add warmth. I personally went with a wooden table with storage compartments, which has been incredibly practical for keeping my living room organized.

If you're interested in exploring some great options, I found an excellent selection here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Some key features to look for:
- Height should be within 1-2 inches of your sofa seat height
- At least 18 inches of space between the table and sofa for comfortable movement
- Rounded corners if you have kids or pets
- Sturdy construction that can handle daily use

For larger sectionals, I've noticed that nesting tables or modular coffee table sets work exceptionally well. They provide flexibility when entertaining guests and can be easily rearranged based on your needs.

Consider these factors when choosing your table:
1. Room size and layout
2. Your sectional's dimensions
3. Storage needs
4. Material durability
5. Style compatibility with existing furniture

After trying several options, I've found that tables with mixed materials (like wood and metal) tend to be more versatile and durable. They also tend to match well with most decor styles.

You can check out more coffee table options and current deals here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Remember to measure your space carefully before making a purchase. I learned this the hard way when my first table was too large and disrupted the room's flow. Also, consider how you'll use the table - do you need space for laptops? Board games? Coffee table books?

The right coffee table can transform your living room from just functional to truly inviting. Since making my selection, I've noticed that my space feels more complete and my guests naturally gather around it during visits.

These insights come from personal experience and extensive research. I hope this helps you find the perfect coffee table for your sectional!",1,1752914362.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I've seen panels of her in bed wearing nightgowns as well as pouring coffee in robes. She doesn't strike me as a very modest woman, so I see no need for her to cover up with her partners. And it seems like a waste of energy to make clothes in her own home. How would she even do it in her sleep?

I'm inclined to believe that she is always naked when she's out in public or somewhere she thinks may require her powers, but clothed when she is at home, or doing relaxing things like lunch at a café.

Pa-kwento lang ako dito kasi hindi ko rin alam kung kanino ko ikkwento hahaha

From 2018 to early month/s of 2019, may ka-fubu akong guy. I was a law student back then and nagreview naman sya ng board exam ng engineering. Ang initial plan ay pang destress lang, hanggang sa sabay na kami nag aaral pag gabi, nagpapadala sya ng highlighters pag kailangan ko and ako naman naghhelp sakanya mag review/memorize ng formulas. Nakapasa na sya ng board nung 2018, pero nag continue pa rin yung set up namin. Bandang 2019, nagddrift away na kami, especially ako kasi natakot talaga ako na baka mafall ako lalo sakanya, tapos matalo ako sa huli. Hanggang sa wala ng contact sa isa’t-isa until this year.

Tapos this year, nagkita kami bigla sa isang meeting. Isa na sya sa top officials ng isang engineering company and kinuha nilang legal representative yung law firm kung saan ako senior associate. (Nasa late 20s pa lang kami pero I can say na we’re both successful na). Nagulat ako and im pretty sure siya rin, but we did not greet each other tamang shake hands lang nung nag introduce na. Nung kamay nya na yung aabutin ko, para akong kinukuryente, andun pa rin pala yung impact nya, malulunod pa rin pala ako sa mata nya. Tapos end na ng meeting, sabi mag coffee na lang raw some other time to discuss other matters. 

After ilang hours nung meeting, may nag chat sakin ng “Hey”, dummy account lang pero alam ko na siya yun. Kanina pa ko nakatitig sa chat, di ko alam kung iaaccept ko ba at rereplyan. Nandito pa rin pala yung fear ko na baka ako lang yung nagmamahal samin. 7 years na, hoy. Mahal kita seven years na. Replyan ko na ba???

PS. Naka dummy acc sya because naka block pa rin sya sa lahat ng socials ko. Alam ko na may feelings sya sakin before, natakot lang talaga ako kasi di pa ako ready mag commit dati at baka ako yung MAS magmahal.

This release marks a turning point for us—where earlier records were heavy on synths, effects, and electronic drums, *Love & Panic* leans into something more acoustic, raw, and organic. The songs explore emotion and space, with mostly melancholic undertones and a few moments of brightness scattered through.

Sonically, it blends alternative rock, pop rock, and **baroque pop** influences—think Coldplay’s introspection mixed with the atmosphere and detail of Radiohead, framed by rich acoustic textures. Every track was written, recorded, and mixed by us, at home. No producers, no studios—just heart, headphones, and a handful of coffee-fueled late nights.

We don’t live together (will be moving out in a couple of months) but we spend most of our free time together. We also both work remotely and tend to do lots of our work together at coffee shops and libraries. 

He estimates his calories but knowing how busy he is, the priority is clearly not put on his overall nutrition.

I’ve been there, spending weeks researching, planning the “perfect” launch, trying cold outreach or messing with ads way too early… 

But I tried something way simpler this time, and it actually worked. This is the exact roadmap:

STEP 1: Solve a problem you have. Ignore trends. Ignore what’s ""hot."" Ask yourself: *What’s something that annoys me?* That’s what I did and that question alone is probably worth $1k/month if you're serious. For me, it was these 3: *“Where do I actually share all my projects? How can I create a waitlsits for my next one? How I track analytics?”*

I had a bunch of tools, side-projects, and ideas. I didn’t want to build a personal site from scratch again, and didn’t want to use Linktree to show my projects either because felt generic and not made for devs.

So I made my own version.

STEP 2: Share the process, not the product. I started posting *why* I was building it, not just *what* I built.  
On Reddit, Twitter, wherever. No links. Just stories, lessons, questions. People connected. Some followed. Some became users.

STEP 3: Ask for feedback, not attention. The most useful growth comes from conversations. I’d DM or reply to people with: ""This thing kinda works. Anything confusing or missing?"" That small shift got me replies, improvements, and even organic shares.

  
STEP 4 (the one that made the difference for me): Make it accessible. When I asked about pricing, one person told me: “Honestly I’d use it if it was less than a coffee.” That stuck. I'm not saying you should charge less, in fact, if you want to make a lot of money you should start charging more. I didnt want to make money, I wanted to hep other devs not to lose time coding or buying a domain that had to renew every year, and setting stupidlu cheap prices helped me differentiate. That alone made me get +150 users.

Hope this post made you learn something.

The tool I built It’s called [link4.dev](https://link4.dev) and it's a simple and clean way of showcasing your startups, creating waitlists in seconds and tracking analytics. If you’ve got multiple projects or ideas scattered across the web, maybe it helps.

I'm getting better at wearing them 20–22 hours a day. To maintain that, I leave them in even while drinking (including coffee), otherwise I’d lose 3 hours every morning. After two weeks, they’re a little stained, but not too noticeable.

I prefer changing trays on Saturdays to avoid discomfort at work, which means I’ll be wearing the next two trays for three weeks each. I’m worried they’ll get really gross by then. After my next apt, I will be going to 2 week rotations and I hope eventually less.

Where would you change baby?,"I'm cringing at my parenting choice, but wasn't sure what I could've done instead. My four month old baby needed a diaper change (wet diaper, if it makes a difference). The coffee shop I was at didn't have a bathroom. No other shops were open yet, no parks nearby, we didn't drive, and I didn't have our stroller with me. I was also there on my own. There were plenty of outdoor tables (10+) at the coffee shop and only one other small group of patrons at the time. The chairs were the flimsy tiny outdoor chairs.

I put a brand new doggy pad on the table and quickly changed him. Normally I would never do this because the table is where people eat, but felt like I didn't have any options. I don't ever want to do this again, so please help.

Where would you change your baby in this situation?",5,1752913084.0,NewParents,25,0.65,False

Occasionally I’ll comment but I’ll say what I’ve been telling people since I quit that my desire for nicotine completely vanished after smoking for 22 years as soon as I quit all caffeine and processed sugar. 

I could stop smoking for 2-3 weeks but eventually the anxiety would build up again and I couldn’t take it anymore. Caffeine caused that anxiety. Sugar made it worse.

A lot of people respond to this by saying that they’re not going to quit coffee. Ok but you are choosing to keep smoking.

Quitting caffeine was extremely difficult and I was tired for a long time but the anxiety was gone and the desire to smoke or vape was completely gone, never to return. I also quit all alcohol because without the anxiety I didn’t feel the need to drink anymore either.

There’s not much else to say. It’s pretty cut and dry, black and white or whatever. ",13,1752913045.0,stopsmoking,2,1.0,False

I am pretty terrible at intro and talking about myself. Regardless of that I am going to try! 

I am up for gaming, talking, being weird…. Which I am really good at. I have been trying to do some weird photos when I am out and about, since I am trying to travel a bit more here and there. I work from home so I am usually around more than I am not. I am also a bit in the spicy brain side, which just means yay for ADHD, anxiety, depression, and honestly who knows what else is going on in there. 

I am an avid coffee and caffeine consumer, fan of all things space and sci-fi, and lover of most food (especially tacos, hell yes tacos). I have been gaming a bit more recently, mostly in Fallout and some of the more chill games. I am not against some others though. 

I do enjoy space and sci-fi as well. I like tv and movies as must of us do, but I tend to gravitate towards things I constantly watch over and over again. That’s the ADHD in the brain.

I am pretty open on talking and answer question, but I am just terrible able these intros lol. NSFW? I mean it could go that way at some point but it’s not something that has come up at all. 

Anyways, if you want to talk to a goofy ass person, I am here for sure. Hit me with your favorite song currently too, because I am always up for checking out what others are listening to!",0,1752912820.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,0.5,False
1m3qxed,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m3qxed/confused_between_adjusting_grind_size_or_shot/,"Confused between adjusting grind size or shot time using dark roast [DeLonghi Icona, Kingrinder K6]","Hi everyone, I'm a complete beginner and recently got into espresso. I bought a Kingrinder K6 and a bottomless portafilter for my cheap DeLonghi machine. I’m using supermarket coffee that's labeled as medium roast, but it seems much darker in practice.

Here’s my current recipe:

* Dose: 14g in
* Yield: 28g out
* Time: 25 seconds

The coffee looks decent with a thick, hazel brown crema but the taste is bitter and unpleasant. I'm trying to figure out whether the bitterness comes from overextraction, and how I can fix it.

I'm considering two options to reduce the bitterness:

1. Finer grind: Reduce grind size so that I get less yield in the same 25 seconds (1:1.5 ratio instead of 1:2).
2. Shorter shot: Keep everything the same but stop the shot earlier, maybe at 20 seconds to reach the same ratio.

I'm leaning toward option 2, because I suspect reducing the grind size might worsen the overextraction. But I’m not sure.

A few extra details:

* Water temp is unknown, since it’s a basic machine.
* I tamp evenly, and I don’t think there’s channeling (based on what I see from the bottomless portafilter).
* No preinfusion is used.
* Puck prep is WDT, leveller, tamp.

Does anyone here have advice on which adjustment works better with dark roast coffee? Shorter time or finer grind? Or should I be changing something else entirely?
