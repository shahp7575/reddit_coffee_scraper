Offers are always welcome, I’ve lucked into some stuff that I really love that I wasn’t necessarily looking for, worst I can do is say no thanks. I do also have a post on r/ G4S, though it would be nice to get my boards finished.  

#**WTT:**

Normal stuff:

- Chase Bliss Tonal Recall RKM, w/wood box 
- Chase Bliss Mood, w/wood box
- Chase Bliss Billy Strings Wombtone, w/box
- Alexander Pedals History Lesson V3, w/box
- Coppersound Gravity Bomb, w/box

*##**Couple of oddballs:**

- Boss ME-X. This one is a big boi, a multi-effect and loop switcher built into a pedalboard case/combo. Has laughable pitch shifting, but decent reverb and modulation, and excellent delay
- Oneder Wet Hot American Bummer, w/box, please for the love of all things good in this world don’t trade for this unless you’re gonna refinish it or otherwise remove the artwork for Oneder (Nick Diener recently got outed as a serial groomer 🤮). I just didn’t love the sound as much as I thought I would, hopefully someone else will love the circuit and refinish it. 


#**WTTF:**

First the utility stuff. If the total values match we can definitely talk bundle deals; these are all things I *need* for my boards, the more I can check off my list the better:

- Cioks 4, or Walrus Canvas 5, 8, or 15 if they have the power brick. 
- Sonic Research ST-300 Mini or Strobostomp Mini; I need two total so one of each or two of either works for me.
- A Morningstar ML5R, Oscillator Devices HYDRA, or other similarly compact 3-5 reorderable MIDI loop switcher. Could also do a Disaster Area DPC.micro (bonus points if it’s the one with no footswitches), or if there’s another Boss compact pedal-size MIDI 3-loop switcher out there I’m all ears.
- I’d definitely consider a Jet Pedals Unity 6, not sure I want to move on from Morningstar but that might cover everything in need in a small box.

As far as sound-changing pedals go:

- Tone King Imperial Preamp
- Coffee Pedals London Fog Delay
- Boss XS-1 or XS-100
- Would probably say yes to an 80Tape In Limbo V, IV, or III
- Also would consider a Jam Pedals Delay Llama Xtreme or Beetronics BeeBeeDee. If you know of other analog delay pedals with pitch shifting/sequencing I’m very interested. And even though it’s not analog I’d be down for a Polarbear Effects Petrichor, hits the same vibe.

Two unlikely things:

- This one is gonna be highly unlikely, but a pedalboard/case combo with outer dimensions of 21.5x13.5x9 or just slightly less (fits carryon dimensions of all but three of the most popular airlines in the EU and NA), with two full levels that can fit standard size pedals anywhere on each level. Realistically I’m mostly looking for pedalboard builder recommendations, but if you somehow miraculously have a board that fits those specs you’ll get priority over everyone else. 
- And this is definitely a ***very*** long shot , but an iPad Pro or MacBook with M3 or later chip and 16GB RAM is something I could definitely use.

1p70gj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1p70gj6/should_i_leave_my_bf/,Should I leave my bf ?,"Hi Ok fam buckle up bc this is gonna be looong and sorry for the grammar mistakes im Ranting lol ! I need some advice on what to do With my situation. So me (23f) have been with my boyfriend Sam (22m) got together when we were 18/19, and I feel like from the start I should have left but couldn’t get myself too. For some context I was abandoned by my parents when I was just 14 so when people come into my life I normally cling onto them scared they are going to leave ( I am working on this, I just currently can’t afford therapy you’ll eventually know why from my story. ), so about about a month into our relationship he asked me to text his brother for him off his phone while he was playing some game   On his Xbox, as I was writing the text out he got an emailed receipt from only fans about his subscriptions, I know it was snoopy of me but I clicked on on the notification and saw he had just spent 60 dollars on varies girls, and he had asked to borrow 60 dollars the day before so Ik he used my OWN money to pay to look at other girls, which broke me very deeply because I made it very clear porn and being lustful for others was against my boundaries  I confronted him immediately and started crying and he said he was sorry and started doting all over me saying he’s never felt this way about a girl before and he would never do it again and was extra lovey for the next couple days. fast forward 6 months later, i wanted to find a link he used to watch free movies because I forgot what it was called and his browser is filled with pornhub, he was watching it multiple times a day even on nights he was at my house when I was either sleeping or at work. when I confronted him he told me he loves me and thinks I’m the most beautiful girl in the world but he has an addiction, so I tried being the most understanding as I could and decided we could work on it together. We had put parental locks on his phone that blocked out all spicy adult websites or images. then one year into our relationship, he gave me his Snapchat login because he worked nights and slept in the day and he didn’t want us to loose our streak bc he wanted to keep the count of days we have talked since we met. so one night it was 3am when I’m normally asleep I saw our streak was about to go out and he wasn’t answering me on messages so I logged in to his snap to find him planing to meet up with a girl he just met on the app THAT VERY NIGHT !!!! at first he was like “I have a gf” but after the girl said she didn’t care and he couldn’t be to happy bc he responded to her, he proceeded to complain about me and agreed to come over after work, driving in the car I bought and was letting him use because he didn’t have one ! When he was supposed to be coming over to my house. I logged him out when I logged in so he knew I was seeing it he kept logging back in and kicking me out. I proceeded to text the girl that it was his girlfriend and I said getting with a man with girl is down right disgusting and blocked her. he then kicked me off his account unblock her and tell her sorry about that, I texted him it was over and to bring my car back in the morning and find a way home. he ended up blocking Her after that and deleting Snapchat in total. after that I woke up to him in my house with plush animals and coffee trying to hug me saying he is so sorry that it was a mistake and he didn’t actually do it and proceeded to be lovey dovey for the next couple days again, I tried to distant myself for awhile because I felt it would help me get the courage to leave……but then those 2 blue lines showed up, so I decided to stay and try to work on things. ( let’s just fast forward because I feel  like this is getting a little long, he never stopped looking at thirst traps on apps or watching porn for another almost 2 years we eventually solved this issue even though it took 2 years to long ) but anyways the day after I gave birth I came home to my mother in law moving all my stuff out of my house into a moving truck (which I later found out they used my card and somehow all 3000 in my account was gone) saying we’re going to be moving in with them for the baby and I was so exhausted from just having a baby and very rough pregnancy with my son (kam) that I decided to leave with kam and go to a my friends (Jessie)  for the day bc I just wanted to relax. I didn’t want to go bc it meant giving up my job that I loved so much, and my house which I’ve lived in since I was 19 and already made my sons nursery in but my say didn’t matter Sam came and picked me up and drove me to my new “home”  and immediately they started making me do all the house chores and if I didn’t I was berated and yelled in my face right next to my newborn so I eventually gave in and did all the chores, cleaning,  cooking, and laundry for a family of 13 with a newborn wrapped across my chest about 6 weeks in I was so exhausted I decided not to do any chores that day, and his brother who is much much larger than me came into my room while I was mid changing my sons diaper and get right up in my and telling me “ to get my disgusting ass in the kitchen” and that I do nothing I put my arm out to keep him out of my face and he picked me up and threw me into the tv my bf and him then fought and I started packing that very second and i called my bf grandpa and he immediately sent me the money to leave, and I will always will be thankful for that. while I was packing his father and mother came into yelling at me and then  dad proceeded to hold me down while his mother beat me up while I couldn’t move the police came they were charged not arrested, but the whole time it was happening it felt like slow nation I was calling for Sam to help me but he just stood there. then he always said he was calling the cops ( he didn’t I did ) and that his dad is bigger and wouldn’t of took him down. he ended up coming with me when i left and went no contact with them, we ended up moving into a friends (Jessie again)  because they worked a job they had to leave alot, but I was the only one who take care of our son the only one who cleaned, all he did was game and sleep and eat when he was home once in a while if I asked he would change a diaper but it have to be on his time not the baby’s. and he wouldn’t let me work bc I needed to take care of my son but won’t  give me money to buy the things i need . and he wouldn’t change his hours at work so I could. he eventually found a place of our own, but it only has one room where the floor is finished and safe and it is mice and bug infested and he won’t help keep it clean or by the things you need to get rid of them. so now I’m with a toddler in a house that we’re confined to one room and if I wanna cook clean or do anything outside of the one room I have to hold a toddler the entire time, now this is where my “last straw “ comes in tonight I was trying to make dinner and he decided to go to bed at 5pm. so I was holding my toddler and was cooking and I ended up spilling boiling water all over my arm i came in there still holding my son saying I burnt myself real bad and he got up handed me a wet rag . then I started to get upset and say this would of never happened if u actually made this place safe enough to put our son down outside the room  he told me hes tired of my bitching when he helped right away and is doing what I want. and went back to bed for me to deal with the burn and a cranky teething toddler who was grabbing at my burn.  I forgot to renew my license when I moved states  and  few to many unpaid tickets (bc i have no income) , I lost it and so can’t drive, and when i suggested I get a new id bc mine was expired  coincidently my wallet was stolen out of the car in the drive with my social and my sons and my forms of identification in it, I had the neighbor check their camera that shows out drive and no one came on the footage so I don’t know what happened there  but he refuses to take me to the social office to replace them bc he “doesn’t have the time” or “has no gas”.  I don’t know to many people in this state since I moved here at 19 and got with him a few months later I didn’t get the chance to make many friends and my friend Jessie moved states for work and also lost most of the ones I did had when I got pregnant bc I couldn’t “have fun” anymore   . so now it’s just me all alone with my son all the time confined to a room and I don’t know what to do, I felt tonight really showed he doesn’t care about me or my well being, but now that I sit here and type this all out and truly think about it I don’t think he ever really did, I am just scared of being alone i guess… should I leave ? I’d have to go to a shelter bc I have no friends or family in this state (no way he let me leave the state with our son ) and that scares me bc he always threatens that he take full custody of our son if I go bc I have no money no license and no home of my own. What should I do if I leave ??? ",1,1764138059.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

**AITA for telling my friend that her ""free"" wedding is unrealistic?**

&#x200B;



I (24f) am a member of a friend group in which one member (we'll call her Coral, 23f) is getting married. She announced her engagement to her fiance (25m) a few weeks ago and we were all happy for her!

Over the weekend, though, she shared more specific plans for the wedding, and that's where things have kinda gone off the rails.

She said she's been seeing a lot of people on tiktok and insta showing how to plan ""free"" weddings--weddings where the couple spends zero dollars (aside from the marriage certificate fee I guess). At first I thought she meant a city hall wedding, which would be completely fine! But then she got I to the details and her expectations for the ceremony.

She's going to try and find someone with a large outdoor space to use (not formally a wedding venue) who will donate their area in support of ""love"", she's going to have all of her guests bring a potluck (with very specific assignments), she will have a friend officiate, a friend do photography, a friend do save the dates and invites, her family do the flowers, etc. Including some harder-to-swing (imo) things like getting a large tent, decorations, wedding favors, speakers, band, etc. I'm not sure what her plan was for a dress.

What's more is that Coral and her fiance really aren't poor, from what I can tell. She works as an accountant at a big company and her fiance does software(?) sales. Plus his parents are loaded. It sounds like they just want to do the free wedding thing for the sake of it.

That would be okay, but she is just shifting all of the costs onto other people (some of whom are probably less well off).

She told me that she wants me to make the cake, and then sent me some pictures ""for inspiration"". The cakes were ridiculously elaborate. We’re talking multi-tier, fondant flowers, gold leaf, and one even had a hand-painted watercolor design. I’m not a professional baker, I just like to bake cookies and brownies sometimes. I told her that those cakes would probably take me days to make, and they wouldn't come out anywhere near as good. She kind of laughed that off and said, ""Oh, it’s not about it being perfect, it’s just about everyone pitching in. It’ll be fun!""

I told her that, fun or not, what she was describing was basically her friends and family subsidizing her wedding (with time, money, and labor) and that it was kind of unfair to expect people to spend so much on her “free” wedding. Or else, she was expecting everyone to show up to a lackluster event and just pretend it was amazing. It's like a group project that none of us wanted to do because we already graduated and moved on from all that so we don't need the credit (she does graduate a year later the rest of us). I said that if she wants a free wedding, she should probably just elope or go to city hall, because this isn’t really free, it’s just free for her (I might have been a bit more forceful in my wording but I didn't swear or call her names or anything like that).

She got super quiet and just looked at me for a minute or so and then left (with another one of our friends driving her home). Later that night, I got a text from that friend saying I had really hurt Coral's feelings, and that even if the plans were a bit unrealistic, I should have just let Coral come to that conclusion on her own.

Coral then messaged me just saying ""Sorry, don't worry about the cake"" with no more context.

I am feeling pretty bad now, especially since Coral was so happy and excited and she never really said anything mean to me. Perhaps I should have just gone along with the cake (since she said she wouldn't be mad if it turned out badly), but I am worried that her wedding would not have been what she wanted. And I was also frustrated about the cake request.

EDIT: Honestly I feel a bit bad now--Coral really is a sweet person who is just a bit naive. I feel like a lot of people in the comments are tearing her up more than she deserves. She has always been the ""baby"" of the group and I just got frustrated and ranted on this case.

I don't know what the fiance thinks about all of this.

*NTA
She's in for a rude awakening the first time she asks for a free party tent from someone. Those are expensive AF to rent.*


**Pristine-Pirate-2386**

*I wanted to do a cheap wedding as we were in grad school and our families couldn’t help much. I rented a park shelter in a very nice park (waterfall nearby etc) for $50. My parents brought basically barbecue. My mil brought a cupcake tower. I made fake flower centerpieces. Bridesmaids picked their own dresses and groomsmen got a matching tie and wore their own clothes. Then we had a cabin for people to hang out after. My friend officiated (but it wasn’t a legal wedding, we did that two weeks earlier) and that was that!
It is possible to do “a wedding” pretty cheaply. It is not possible to do a fancy wedding for free.*




**Puzzleheaded-Ad7606**

*We rented a nice community center in a nice neighborhood for $200 for the day and used very little decor beyond candles and tablecloths. I found my brideamaids' dresses on clearance at Macy's for $10 a piece (simple below the knee black sleeveless) and they each carried a single lily, my MIL made my dress and family made the food, and my SIL took pictures. My husband's tux was free when the groomsmen rented theirs. I made the cake.*

**Total cost under $2000.**

*I completely agree. Cheap is possible but it's not going to be fancy and people need to volunteer rather than being volunTOLD.*


**[deleted]**

NTA
Your friend is also embarrassing herself.
“Guests” are not beneficiaries and employees. Coral is being tacky and I honestly have secondhand embarrassment for her. I think a realistic discussion about this is akin to letting her know she has spinach in her teeth.


**Difficult_Jury_7455**

*That's really sweet that she wanted to let you spend a good hundred bucks on cake materials out of your own pocket for her wedding*



**WafnaAbroad**

&#x200B;

Hi there. My last post sort of blew up lol. I really didn't think so many people would be that interested in my silly friend group drama.

Short recap: my friend ""Coral"" announced she was going to have a ""free wedding"", with all of her friends playing roles to volunteer a nice venue, tent, food, photography, band, cake (my role), etc. It sounded okay at first but her expectations seemed unrealistically lavish, and I told her that (in stronger wording), and she got upset.

After reading the comments, I honestly began to feel bad for Coral. She really is a kindhearted person, but a lot of people interpreted her as an insane entitled bridezilla. That's really not the case. I decided I was going to make the cake, and I sent her an apology text (to which I didn't get any reply; that was making me really anxious). I still didn't think that Coral's requests were that reasonable, and wasn't expecting the wedding to fully go to her plans, but that's not for me to worry about.

Finally, I got a message from Coral's fiance (who we'll call ""Basil""), asking to meet up. I said yes.

My expectation going into this was that Basil would tell me how much I hurt Coral's feelings, and I was going to reiterate my apology and share some research/planning I had done on the cake. That's not how it went though.

As it turns out, the whole ""free wedding"" thing was Basil's idea. That's not the impression I got before. Basil didn't at first explain why he wanted to do it, but when pressed it sounds like it's so he could spend the money that he and Coral had been saving up for their wedding on something else. A boat (a ""Catalina 27"", apparently). Very useful and practical thing to have when you are living in the city! Especially if your fiance gets seasick (we did one of those river cruise things a while back and she had a bad time; Basil says he'll help her get over that and sailboats are different).

Anyway, after my whole outburst before, Coral has apparently been having second thoughts about the ""free wedding"" things. Basil asked me to talk to her, apologize, and tell her that it isn't a bad idea after all. He basically said I owe it to him to help clean up the ""mess"" I caused.

I don't feel great about that though. I don't want to drive a wedge between Coral and Basil, but telling her I think it's a good idea after all feels like lying, and I guess actively advocating for a potential trainwreck is a further line for me than just agreeing to play my assigned voluntold-baker role. Moreover, this was my first real conversation with Basil, and I have to say I'm not totally convinced he's a great person. I don't know if he has exactly ""manipulated"" her into going along with this, but it kinda feels that way.

So what do I do? It's been a little while now since I talked to Basil so I really do need to do something, be it what Basil asked, or further involving myself in drama by telling Coral I that I don't think the wedding (or the entire marriage?) is a good idea.

**No-Sea1173**

*NTA. 
I would be a good friend and tell her the truth. That you think the free wedding idea is foolish, but ask her to explain more what she thinks about basil and the boat. Let her talk it out herself, she my already be starting to see Basil for who he is. 
Also - the free wedding isn't free. It's pushing the cost from the couple onto their friends so they can buy a boat.*



**Head_Razzmatazz7174**

*She might not know about the boat. Just casually ask her what type of boat Basil was planning to get and where he was going to keep it? If they are living in an apartment, the complex might not allow it. And it's a huge temptation to thieves. Even with a boat lock, someone could come in, break the lock, hook it up to a large truck and be out of there within 10 minutes or less.
Happened to a friend of mine. It was there for maybe a couple of weeks, and he had his truck parked next to it. Came out to go to work and the boat was gone, trailer and all. This was before security cameras, so there was no way to figure out where it went.*




**bztxbk**

*A Catalina 27 is a 27 foot boat. You gotta dock it and pay docking fees plus water and power usage. In the winter you gotta pay to winterize it. This boat comes with a lot of maintenance and upkeep costs.*


>OOP:
Honestly I was surprised after looking up the cost of the boat since I feel like they would still have money leftover in their fund after spending $5k-$10k on the boat (just from what I know of Coral and Basil's situation). But he is probably budgeting for all those other expenses I didn't think of, I guess.

**Mango_Design_0192**

*How about you just show Cora that you are there for her, no matter what she wants?
Don’t follow Basil’s request. Just be there for Cora.
Offer to meet up with her, and just ask about her: how is she? And listen to her.
Be true to yourself, and be a good friend to her.
That is all (easy to say!) you need to do.*


>OOP:
Thank you. This is honestly what I want to do, but given she didn't reply to my last text, I'm worried about if she'll even meet up with me if the first thing I say isn't directly taking back all my concerns from before.



**whoisaname**

*Makes me wonder if Basil is telling (forcing) her not to respond. Continuing to try to check in and being a friend to listen could be much much bigger than you think.*



>OOP:
I hope that's not it. I will try to reach out to her another way.


**Tpain2233**

*Maybe reach out, pretending you need to talk about cake details. Then, casually, bring up that you had coffee with Basil and how interesting it was that they are getting a boat. Just be playful about it ... like "" did you guys think of boat names"" ....*

1p7094m,https://youtu.be/4Fa3MRJYe7w,4 Very Scary TRUE Pre-Dawn Commute Horror Stories,"# ""Five Miles to Hell"":

I left the house at four in the morning, same as every weekday. The air was cold enough to bite, the kind that makes the world feel hollow and half-asleep. My old sedan coughed awake, headlights cutting a narrow tunnel through the dark. The town was silent behind me, no one stirring yet—just the hum of the engine and the faint glow of the dashboard.

I sipped burnt coffee from my thermos, settling into the quiet, when new headlights appeared in my rearview mirror. High beams. Far back at first. A truck, maybe. It closed the distance fast, faster than made sense for an empty highway, and then it sat right behind me—too close.

I drifted to the right lane to let it pass. It didn’t. It stayed glued to my bumper, lights washing out my mirrors, turning the inside of my car into a blinding white box. I couldn’t make out the make or the shape—just height, size, and those damn lights.

I sped up from fifty to sixty. The truck matched me. Slowed to forty-five. It did the same. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, a slow burn growing in my gut.

The highway here cut through dense woods—no exits, no houses, no help. Just a black wall of trees and a long stretch of nothing. I reached for my phone on the passenger seat. Signal flickered between one bar and none. I managed to call my coworker, Ben, who always left around the same time.

“Hey, it’s me,” I said, trying to keep my voice level. “You on the road yet?”

“Just left,” Ben said. “Why? You sound weird.”

“There’s a truck behind me. Won’t pass. Won’t back off.”

A short silence. “Where are you?”

“Eastbound 45. Just passed the old mill.”

“Next rest area’s about five miles. Pull in and see what he does. If he stops too… don’t get out. Call the cops.”

I nodded, even though he couldn’t see. “Alright. I’ll call you back.”

The truck crept even closer—so close I felt the vibration through my seat. I swerved slightly to test him. He mirrored it perfectly. My breathing started to speed up. My brain went straight to the headlines I’d seen over the years—people disappearing on backroads before sunrise, cars found empty, families left without answers.

Focus. Just get to the rest area.

The sign finally appeared, glowing like a lifeline. I signaled, slowed, and pulled in. The lot was empty except for a single flickering light that cast long, broken shadows across the pavement. The truck pulled in behind me without hesitation, parking two spots over. No movement inside.

I locked my doors immediately and dialed 911.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

I kept my voice low. “There’s a truck that’s been following me. I’m at the rest area off Highway 45. He just pulled in.”

“Okay sir, stay in your vehicle. Help is on the way. Can you describe the truck?”

“Dark… maybe black. Big tires. No plate I can see.”

A door creaked open. My heart stuttered.

A man stepped out—tall, broad, wearing a hooded jacket and jeans. He walked with a slow, deliberate pace toward my car, hands tucked in his pockets. His face was mostly shadow, but I caught stubble, maybe thirty or forty, eyes locked on mine. He stopped at my window and knocked twice.

I cracked it an inch. “What do you want?”

He leaned in, breath fogging the glass. “Saw you swerving back there. Everything alright?”

“I’m fine. Heading to work.”

He smiled. It wasn’t friendly—more like someone practicing a smile they never actually used. “Early shift, huh? Me too. Truck’s been acting up. Thought maybe you had tools. Mind if I check under your hood? Maybe trade something.”

“No thanks,” I said. “I’m good.”

The smile dropped. “Come on. Don’t be rude.”

His hand closed around the door handle. It rattled. Locked. His expression tightened.

“Open up. I need help.”

My pulse hammered. “Back off. Police are coming.”

He snarled, then pulled something from his pocket—a knife, small but sharp enough to catch the flickering light. He pressed the blade against the window.

“Get out. Now.”

That was all I needed.

I stomped the gas. The tires screeched on the pavement, and the car shot forward. In the mirror, the man sprinted back to his truck, dove in, and roared after me. His headlights filled the rearview again, trembling with each bump. He was coming fast—faster than before.

The dispatcher stayed on the line. “Units are close. Just keep driving.”

The next curve approached too quickly. My car shuddered as I took it. Behind me, his truck fishtailed, then realigned. He rammed my bumper once—then again, harder. Metal shrieked. My head snapped forward.

“Where are they?” I muttered, half to myself.

Then—up ahead—red and blue lights lit the trees like fireworks. Two police cruisers blocked the road, officers braced behind doors. I hit the brakes and skidded to a stop. The truck swerved left, trying to U‑turn, but the cops swarmed before he could pick up speed. They dragged him out screaming, pinned him face-down, cuffed him.

I sat there shaking, engine idling, the world suddenly too bright.

An officer jogged up to my window. “You okay?”

I nodded, though my voice cracked. “Yeah. What was his deal?”

The officer exhaled. “We’ve been looking for him. He’s been targeting early-morning drivers for weeks. Following them, forcing them off the road. We found rope, duct tape, all kinds of things in his cab. You’re lucky you called when you did.”

At the station later, they told me the rest. His name was Robert Hayes. Out on parole for assault. Linked to multiple attacks—one woman found dead in the woods last month. They’d suspected him, but never caught him in the act. Until me.

Ben called while I filled out paperwork. “You good, man? Heard sirens on the scanner.”

“Yeah,” I said, still shaky. “He tried to run me off the road.”

“That’s insane. You taking the day off?”

I thought about it. “No. Shift starts soon.”

But driving wouldn’t ever feel the same again.

Now, every morning, every set of headlights behind me makes my stomach tighten. I check my mirrors twice. Sometimes three times. The road before dawn isn’t peaceful anymore. Just quiet. Too quiet.

They said Hayes confessed when they showed him dash cam footage from another victim—someone who wasn’t as lucky. I keep thinking about that. How close I came. How a simple shift at the factory could’ve ended a different way.

I still drive the same route, but I don’t sink into the quiet anymore. I stay awake, alert, waiting. Because once you’ve seen headlights in the dark that weren't just headlights, you never unsee them.





# ""The Basement"":

I woke before my alarm, like I always did for my five a.m. shift. The house was still, my two roommates lost in sleep down the hall. Our small apartment on the west side of town was close enough to walk to the diner, where I served coffee to truckers and factory workers. Usually, the quiet streets didn’t bother me, but that morning, something felt off as I pulled on my coat and boots. I checked the mirror, grabbed my purse, and stepped into the cold, empty street.

The walk to the bus stop took ten minutes, winding past shuttered houses and dim alleys. I kept my pace steady, thinking about the day ahead—pouring endless cups of coffee, listening to the same stories, smiling at the same faces. Tom from the mill always left a generous tip and asked about my classes at the community college. I forced a smile at the thought, trying to shake the unease curling in my stomach. Maybe it was the early hour. Maybe it was something else.

Then I heard it—footsteps behind me. Not loud, not hurried, just deliberate, matching my pace. I glanced over my shoulder. Nothing. Just parked cars, garbage cans waiting for pickup. I told myself it was a neighbor heading out early, maybe to the mill. But the steps didn’t stop. They got closer. My breath fogged in the cold air. I picked up my pace.

“Hello?” a soft voice called from behind.

I stopped. A man stood there, maybe in his twenties, dark jacket, dark pants, ordinary in every way except for the intensity in his eyes. “Do you know what time the next bus comes?” he asked, stepping closer.

“Should be here soon, around four-forty,” I said, clutching my purse strap, forcing calm into my voice. “You new around here?”

He nodded, faint smile tugging at his lips. “Just moved in down the block. First day at a new job. Mind if I walk with you? Safer that way, right?”

I hesitated. The polite part of me said yes; the warning bell in my head screamed no. The bus stop was just ahead. “Sure,” I muttered, starting again. He fell in step beside me.

“So, what do you do?”

“Waitress at the diner on Main,” I said, short. “Early mornings are the worst, but it pays the bills.”

He chuckled. “Construction. Up before everyone else. Name’s Larry.”

“Anna,” I said before thinking.

We turned into the alley shortcut, the one I’d walked a thousand times without concern. But with him beside me, the narrow path felt suffocating. Walls of houses boxed us in, shadows pooling at our feet.

“You live alone?” His tone had shifted, casual now, probing.

“No, with roommates. Why?”

“Just curious. Quiet neighborhood. Not many out this early.”

Halfway through, he stopped suddenly. “Wait—I think I dropped my wallet back there. Can you help me look?”

Alarm bells rang. “No—I have to catch my bus.” I tugged at my purse.

His smile vanished. He stepped in front of me. “Come on. It’ll just take a second. Don’t be like that.”

Panic surged. I backed up. “Get out of my way.”

He lunged. His hand clamped over my mouth. I kicked, twisted, struggled. He pressed me against a garage wall, whispering, “Shh, don’t make this hard.”

Instinct took over. I bit down hard. His fingers gave way just enough for me to scream. “Help! Somebody help!”

Lights flicked on. A door creaked. “What’s going on out there?” a man shouted.

He froze, then shoved me to the ground and bolted, vanishing into the shadows. I scrambled up, shaking, running toward the voices. An older couple stood on their porch, eyes wide.

“Are you okay, miss?” the woman asked, wrapping a blanket around me as her husband called the police.

I nodded, tears streaming. “He… he tried to hurt me. Said he lived nearby.”

The police arrived quickly. I described him in detail—the plain face, the questions, the attack. “We’ll look into it,” one officer said. “There have been a few incidents like this lately. Stay safe, maybe get a ride next time.”

I missed my bus. The officers drove me to work. All day, I flinched at every customer who looked familiar. That night, my roommates waited, worried.

“What happened?” one asked, hugging me tight.

I told them everything. “He seemed normal at first… but then…” My voice broke. “I think he would have done worse if people hadn’t heard me.”

We locked every door. I didn’t sleep. The next day, the papers reported another assault—same method, same early hour. A woman walking to her job. Not as lucky.

Weeks passed. Warnings went out: don’t walk alone. Report suspicious people. I started carpooling, but the fear lingered. Later, I saw a sketch in the paper—plain face, dark hair. Larry Fisher, suspect in multiple assaults, living in a basement apartment nearby.

The thought that I had walked with him, talked to him, made me nauseous. What if I hadn’t bitten him? What if no one had heard?

Years later, I still avoid early shifts. The memory of his hand on my mouth, the whisper in my ear, shadows in a quiet alley—it stays with me. That ordinary morning walk became something I’ll never escape.





# ""The Tampa"":

I had just finished my late shift at the donut shop, wiping down counters and locking up around 2 a.m. The streets of Tampa were silent at that hour, broken only by the occasional hum of a passing car beneath the dim glow of streetlights. I swung my leg over my bike and pedaled toward home, a familiar twenty-minute route through quiet neighborhoods I thought I knew. But that night, something felt off, though I couldn’t have said what.

The rustle came first, soft and deliberate, behind me. I froze for a split second before convincing myself it was probably just an animal in the bushes. Then, without warning, a hand clamped over my mouth, and a strong arm wrapped around my neck, yanking me off the bike. My scream was stifled instantly. “Don’t make a sound, or I’ll kill you right here,” a low, chilling voice hissed in my ear.

He dragged me toward a darkened car parked just ahead. I kicked and thrashed, but he was stronger than I could have imagined, pinning my arms behind my back. “Stop fighting,” he growled. “Or this ends now.” The trunk swung open, and before I could process what was happening, he shoved me inside and slammed it shut. Darkness swallowed me whole. I pounded on the metal, my heart hammering, but the car started moving, the sound of the engine deafening in the confined space.

Time blurred. Every turn, every stop, felt endless. Finally, the car came to a halt. The trunk opened, and a rag was pressed over my eyes. “Walk,” he commanded, guiding me by the arm. The world was a blur of shadows and muffled sounds. When the blindfold was finally removed, I saw him. Ordinary-looking, dark hair, eyes void of empathy, yet radiating a calm menace that made my stomach twist.

The apartment was dim, cluttered with empty bottles and scattered clothes. He shoved me onto a mattress on the floor and tied my hands with rope. “You’re staying here until I decide what to do with you,” he said flatly.

I swallowed hard. “Why… why are you doing this?” My voice trembled.

He paced, silent for a long moment. “Because I can,” he said finally. “Girls like you disappear. Nobody cares.” My blood ran cold. He sat across from me, studying me as if I were a puzzle. “Tell me about yourself. What’s your name?”

“Lisa,” I said, trying to sound calm. “I’m seventeen. I live with my grandmother. Please… just let me go. I won’t tell anyone.”

A soft, chilling laugh escaped him. “You think it’s that simple? No one leaves.”

Hours dragged on. He asked questions about my life, my job, my family, even my dreams. I answered cautiously, trying to humanize myself, hoping to stir some spark of empathy—or hesitation—inside him. Occasionally, he untied me just enough to eat, handing me cold food. I forced it down, my stomach in knots.

In the quiet, he revealed fragments of himself. “I hate this world,” he muttered. “People have hurt me. Now I hurt them back.” I nodded slowly, speaking gently. “That sounds painful. Maybe there’s another way.” He shot me a glare. “You don’t know anything.”

As dawn broke, light filtered weakly through the curtains, but the room remained locked tight. He grew restless, pacing, checking windows. “Cops might be looking,” he muttered. I seized on the opportunity. “If you let me go, I can say I ran away. No one has to know.”

He shook his head. “Not yet.”

He forced me to shower while watching, humiliation coiling tight around me. Afterwards, he tied me up again and left. I could hear him moving in the apartment, plotting, thinking, the minutes stretching endlessly. When he returned, his mood had darkened.

“I could end this right now,” he said, producing a gun and pressing the cold barrel to my temple. “Beg for your life.”

Tears ran down my face. “Please… don’t. I have so much to live for. My grandmother needs me.”

He hesitated. Slowly, he lowered the gun. “You’re different from the others,” he admitted. “They all screamed, fought. You… talk.”

I spoke. I told him about my past—abuse, loneliness, the weight of feeling invisible. Sometimes, he shared fragments of his life, the rejection and anger that had twisted him. “Women always leave me,” he confessed. “That’s why I take control.” I tried to reason gently. “Control doesn’t erase pain. Letting go might.”

By evening, he seemed conflicted, loosening the ropes, letting me sit on the couch. Fear never left, though. Every glance, every pause, made my heart stutter. Finally, he asked, almost casually, “What if I drive you somewhere and drop you off?”

Hope flared. “Yes, please. I won’t say a word.”

He thought for a long while, then nodded. “Fine. But if you lie, I’ll find you.” Blindfolded again, I was led to the car. We drove in tense silence. When the blindfold came off, we were in a wooded area, still dark. “Go,” he said. “Run home and forget this.”

I bolted, legs trembling, until I reached a road and flagged down a car. The driver, an older woman, immediately saw the panic in my eyes and drove me to the police. I gave them every detail—the apartment, the car, even fingerprints I had deliberately left behind.

The investigation moved quickly. My description, combined with the clues I’d left, led to the arrest of Bobby Joe Long, a man suspected in multiple murders. He confessed, but my testimony helped stop him.

Looking back, those twenty-six hours were the longest of my life—the fear, the uncertainty, the constant threat pressing down. But staying calm, staying human, talking to him—it saved me. That night changed me, but it didn’t break me. Today, I work in law enforcement, helping others survive the unimaginable, knowing firsthand the fragile line between life and death.





# ""Before Dawn"":

I woke up to the alarm buzzing at 4:30 a.m., its sharp trill slicing straight through the quiet of my room. For a moment, I lay there in the dark, letting the weight of the early hour sink in. My shift at the bakery started at six, and the only way to make it on time was catching the 5:15 bus. It was a routine I’d perfected for months—wake up, get dressed, slip out the door without disturbing my roommate—but that morning, something in the air felt different. Heavier. Still.

I tugged on my coat, slung my bag over my shoulder, and eased the front door closed until the latch clicked softly behind me. The neighborhood was silent in that strange way that feels more like holding its breath than truly resting. Only the faint hum of a distant car reminded me that the world was still turning.

I unpeeled a banana as I walked—my little morning ritual, a bit of energy before the long shift ahead. The streetlights glowed weakly, casting long, pale shadows across the pavement. The air felt colder than usual, the darkness somehow thicker. I kept telling myself I was overthinking it, that I’d just woken up groggy and jittery. But each step echoed just a little too loudly in my ears.

The bus stop was four blocks away. I’d walked the route a hundred times, but that morning every house I passed felt like it was watching me through dark, shuttered windows. I tried brushing off the unease creeping up my spine, focusing instead on the warm banana in my hand, the familiar rhythm of my footsteps.

Then I heard the other footsteps.

At first I assumed they were mine, bouncing off the silent houses. But these were heavier. Faster. Closing in. I quickened my pace, glancing over my shoulder without turning my head fully.

A man had stepped out from the mouth of an alley behind me. Tall. Shoulders hunched inside a dark hoodie. A black mask covering everything but his eyes. And those eyes—wide and unblinking—locked straight onto me.

My stomach dropped. I looked ahead, pretending I didn’t notice him, hoping maybe he’d turn in another direction. But his pace matched mine, each step quickening.

“Hey,” he called out, his voice low and scratchy, like gravel dragged across cement.

I didn’t respond. I just walked faster.

“Hey!” he said again—closer now.

My heart hammered in my chest. I rounded the corner, the bus stop only a block and a half away. Almost there. Just keep moving.

Suddenly, he was in front of me.

He stepped out so fast I nearly collided with him. And then I saw it—the gun in his hand, small but unmistakably real, angled straight at my forehead. Under the flickering streetlight, the metal gleamed like something alive.

“Give me your purse and your bag,” he said, voice steady, eyes burning with a frantic intensity that made my skin crawl.

For a second, I couldn’t speak. My breath came in tiny, shaky bursts. “Please… don’t,” I whispered, my hand trembling as I slowly, carefully extended my purse toward him.

He snatched it away. But he didn’t leave. Didn’t take a step back. Something in his posture shifted, darker, more deliberate.

He grabbed my arm—hard—and yanked.

“Come on,” he said, jerking his head toward the alley he’d come from. “Move.”

“No—no, please—” The words barely escaped before he clamped a gloved hand over my mouth.

“Shut up,” he hissed into my ear, breath sour and hot. “You scream again, I’ll blow your head off.”

The cold weight of the gun pressed into my side. Panic hammered through me. My vision tunneled. I dug my heels into the sidewalk, twisting, kicking, anything—but his grip only tightened, dragging me deeper into the shadowed alley where no one could see.

I realized then—if he got me in there, really in there—I wouldn’t be coming back out.

I bit him. Hard. Hard enough to taste the chemicals from his glove. He jerked back with a sharp cry.

It was all the opening I needed.

I tore free and ran.

I sprinted toward the street, toward the bus stop, toward any possibility of help. “Help! Help! He has a gun!” I screamed, my voice cracking. The banana slipped from my hand and bounced away, absurdly bright against the dark pavement.

He was chasing me. I could hear his feet pounding behind me, hear him spit curses under his breath. “Get back here!”

Lights flicked on in nearby windows. Porch bulbs clicked to life. But the street still felt endless.

He grabbed the back of my jacket, yanking me sideways. I stumbled, nearly went down. He raised the gun again.

“I will kill you,” he snarled, his voice an unhinged growl.

Pure instinct took over. I spun and ducked behind a parked car, pressing myself low. My breath shuddered in my throat. “Leave me alone!” I screamed, forcing my voice into the open.

And that’s when a door opened.

An older man stepped out of his house across the street, shining a flashlight toward us. “What’s going on out here?” he called, voice firm, steady, like he wasn’t afraid of the gun at all.

The attacker hesitated. Just a heartbeat. But enough.

“Mind your business!” he barked, though fear seeped into the edges of his words.

“I’m calling the police,” the man said. No hesitation. No fear. Just certainty.

And then—something I’ll never forget—the attacker let out this strange, high‑pitched scream. Not a yell. Not a threat. Something raw and animalistic. A sound so full of rage it prickled every hair on my arms.

He turned and bolted back into the alley, swallowed by the shadows.

I slid down against the side of the car, sobbing so hard I could barely breathe. The older man rushed over, placing a steadying hand on my arm.

“Are you hurt?” he asked, shining the light gently over me.

“He… he tried to take me,” I choked out. “He had a gun.”

“I know,” he said quietly. “You’re safe now. Stay with me.”

Sirens echoed through the neighborhood minutes later. Officers searched the alley, collected my purse—which he’d thrown aside after emptying my wallet—but he was gone.

At least for the moment.

Hours later, the police found him. A few towns away, hiding behind a gas station. They said he matched my description exactly—mask and all. They also said he’d been doing this for weeks. Watching bus routes. Targeting women who walked alone in the early morning.

“You fought,” one officer told me. “It made all the difference.”

In the days that followed, the aftermath settled in like a weight on my chest. Nights became harder. Shadows felt thicker. Footsteps behind me—even harmless ones—made my hands shake. My roommate noticed how I jolted at every sound, so we installed better locks, extra lights, anything to help me sleep again.

Weeks later, I saw the older man at the grocery store. He recognized me instantly.

“How are you holding up?” he asked gently.

I thanked him again—really thanked him. His face softened.

“Most people stay inside,” he said. “But I heard someone in trouble. It’s what anyone should do.”

I wanted to believe that. But the truth is, not everyone does.

And some mornings, when I’m awake before dawn and the house is silent, I still hear that scream—sharp, wild, echoing from the alley. A reminder of how close I came to vanishing into the dark.

I am horrified and frankly resentful at what the public service has become. 

Employees don’t matter. That includes EXs. Decisions are made on optics and business interests. RTO for example is the most regressive thing to have happened to the public service. Both EXs and staff need some flexibility to be able to be effective and healthy human beings and to see us regressing to satisfy business interests and whiny stakeholders is frankly disgusting. We all know people work better and more efficiently from home - and still spend their money!! Maybe just not at that specific subway downtown, but a more suburban coffee shop. 

The new, more stringent language laws don’t make sense. The working language in my team is English no one speaks French. But I’m in a position where I have to prioritize French results over any other management competency when I am hiring. Excellent leader, people skills, competencies, etc? Doesn’t matter. If they don’t have cbc, nothing else matters. But that low performing person who has Es? They are now most likely to get the job. Language training is also no longer a thing. Who has money or time to train people? 

The physical workplace is frankly unworkable. Not having an office as an executive who is constantly in meetings and having sensitive conversations is inexcusable. It is disruptive and unfair to everyone around. And the idea that staff don’t have assigned proper desks or don’t have a place to leave a few things, etc, is just plain sad. Even kids at schools have lockers. 

Not to that, people don’t even know what part of the city they’re going to work in from one year to the next. Offices move locations at a whim, changing commute times sometimes by over an hour each way and having devastating impacts on families with caregiving responsibilities or frankly anyone just trying to survive in this city with unbearable traffic and inefficient and unreliable public transportation.  

We’ve been “doing more with less” since I joined 20 years ago. We just can’t anymore. We are barely functioning and about to cut even more. 

There is more but I don’t even have the energy to type it all out. I’m exhausted. I’m done. Except I have to keep going …. Because I can’t retire yet.

The season has me kinda bummed. First time in 18 years I have Thanksgiving and Christmas off. Newly(ish) single, gave my house up to my ex and the kids because it was the right thing to do. But it kinda set in that I was finally able to enjoy the holidays for the first time in 18 years... and I don't get to enjoy it with my family. I don't get to sit in my living room with a hot cup of coffee near my fireplace and enjoy it. Just kinda bummed out. 

I'm a bit of a workaholic because I can't afford to not be, so I figured I'd reach out here to see if anyone could help me disappear into my phone and make things not so fucking lonely.

Now I try to find her in every other girl,"I hadn't slept with a girl  in a while. I've only slept with my long term girlfriends and I moved provinces recently. Met this cute girl (20F) and we hit it off really well. We hung out and slept. I knew it was going to be a one night stand but I didn't expect my hormones to kick in after so long and missed her the second she left. I slept with three different girls after that consecutively every night just to get the thought of her out of my head. I still vividly reminisce about her every now and then and secretly hope that the next girl helps me erase the memory. 

I reached out to her to tell her how I felt knowing she wouldn't give me a favourable response. We ended things on a good note though She explained to me that she initially liked hanging out with me as well and was initially down to meet me again but then made up her mind because she was not emotionally available for anything.

I'm fine keeping things superficial I know I can turn my feelings off when I'm with her but this longing to see her again kills me on the inside. I know things may get only more complicated or may just sort out and we both turn I to good fwb's. 

And before you suggest me seeking a proper relationship to move on, I don't have the emotional capacity to commit to anyone at the moment as well. That's why I get her decision to end things. 

I don't know how to navigate this feeling at all it feels like I fell for her but my ego just cannot accept it. I've felt with bad breakups before and I know this will pass over time. However, I always think in the back of my head every night wondering what if we actually made it to the second date. How different and sweet things could turn out.  

Life really is nothing but a bunch of what ifs, I pray that fate brings us together again though. Even if we've moved on. I'd like to have a nice coffee and movie night with her again. 

TL;DR: Slept with an Abg after a while, fell for her. Now I search for her in every other girl I sleep with. ",0,1764136824.0,relationships,6,0.27,False

1p701p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p701p6/the_monster_of_newport_rd/,The Monster of Newport Rd,"I was just seventeen years old when I was given world shattering news, my dad had stage four esophagus cancer. That word has a tremendous amount of weight attached to it, once that word enters your life it is like a cockroach. You can’t get rid of it no matter how you try to erase it, the darkness, fear, and the unknown never truly leaves you. From that moment onward my life had become dedicated to taking care of my dad, my days became school then going to the house to visit my dad then back home and repeat. I had never met a man with such horrific luck in my life, he had gotten every single negative side effect you could’ve  possibly imagined. He had lost his hearing, he had described it has be permanently had earmuffs over his ears. The doctor then recommended he try a different treatment to hopefully counter the ill effects of the hearing loss, the new medication took his taste from him. He would cry at the dinner table barely able to eat, I remember one ill fated dinner he threw the plate against the wall and began to ball his eyes out. “It all tastes like fucking sewage” he shouted as he rushed over to the bathroom to throw up the little food he had eaten. After three days of him not eating he was once again put onto his third treatment. The third one crippled him, he had developed neuropathy. He lost the ability to walk and he could even hold a plate with him dropping it. The neuropathy was the beginning of the end, he became bed ridden. The day he came home all of the energy had shifted and changed into a thick heavy aura the weighed down the entire home. The days started feeling slower and longer, felt like the entire house had been filled with a thick viscous syrup.  He went from being the pilar of the family, a man who coached every sports team, running and screaming on the sidelines to a shriveled man with barely the strength to hold a half filled plastic cup. His stomach had become hard and swollen from the cancerous fluid that began leaking into his abdominal cavity. Draining his stomach over and over having the brown liquid into light bulb looking bottles, after the draining his breathing would finally improve and he would regain just a touch of the life and energy he usually would have. At night that’s when things would become weird, I’d go to the bathroom and he would hear my dad in a sing song voice “I’m dying im dyinggg” to himself in the dark. I still remember one night I woke up to take a leak and I hear muffled talked through my door, once I walk out my door I wanted to check in on him. “Hey dad, you alright” I asked. “yeah buddy, you actually just missed your great grandma.” He said with an almost child like enthusiasm. “Okay?  Where did you see her?” “she was right there in the corner of the living room! You must’ve just missed her.” That night made it hard to go to sleep after that, I would hear him talking or singing or just plain crying. It all came to a head in on the 26th of November, I just remember being so tired. God I was so tired, I had finally lost the battle of going on minimal sleep. I gave in to the soft felt of the couch, on that night it really felt like all the stresses of the world vanished. I was in the living room with him, if he needed me he could a just called me. The next thing I knew I woke up to a voice screaming my dad’s name. “Tony! Tony!” Movies make death look for grandiose, some large spectacle that is full of pageantry. I can tell you that is 100% the furthest thing from the truth.  I another up from my nap to a scene that is now forever burned into the deepest recesses of my brain. He was breathing slow, agonal, he had a wild look in his eyes. One that a you would see on a farm animal in the kill shoot, aimless fear and incomprehensible understanding.  I rushed over to him and tried to put his nasal cannula on his nose, but for some reason I will never know he turned his head from me. I can’t remember  his favorite color or the recipe to his chilli but I can never for the look he gave me when he took his last breath. I slumped onto the floor in defeat, all the plans, all the dreams we shared just gone in the blink of an eye. After the cornor came and took my dad away I just sat on his hospice bed in complete silence. I sat there dumbfounded, my whole world had just crumbled right in front of me. As I thought to myself “how on earth can this get any worse,” she came. It started slow like a sickness it started small, I saw a shadow in the corner of my eye to random bumps and noises. Then one day it kicked up a notch or two, I was showering home alone and from down the hall I could hear foot steps.. slow deliberate, the steps slowly got louder as they got closer then they suddenly stopped at the door. One large bang on the door sent me damn near through the roof “ holy shit! hello” I said in a panick. I’m not sure if you’ve ever been butt naked being put into fight or flight but I flung the shower curtain open and bum rushed the door. I grab that handle and took a quick deep breath, I flung the door open ready to face whatever was behind the door. I look to the right and the left analyzing what coulda made that sound, after a few moments I just assumed I must’ve heard something. Maybe  the lack of sleep and loneliness played some tricks on me. The torment went on for weeks, but it had just been little things, knocks, noises, shadows. Things to just make me question myself did I just hear that? But it slowly ramped up in intensity it then became hearing voices. I would be fillin out a college application “that’s too hard for you.” It wanted to beat me down, make me weak, vulnerable.  I started staying at home more I would ignore friends and family, the more I heard the voices the more of a burden I felt. This thing was stripping me down piece by piece, whisper every insecurity I ever had, every little thing I was ever worried about they confirmed were true. I had been just so weighed down, so mentally and emotionally exhausted, I had decided I wouldn’t go to school one morning. Just lay in the couch and rot, but that thing had another plan. I was watching some king of the hill and trying to relax and charge my mental battery. But then a familiar sound rang through the house, the slow quiet creek of the floor boards. I peered  around the tv and all the air had been sucked from my lungs. Standing down the hall was a sight that had me frozen in terror. It’s hair was black an greasy it covered her face, her skin was pale and thin. So thin you could see the veins, arteries, muscles and joints move and shift underneath it. Her breast hung down to her mid thigh, her nails had to have been 3-4 inches long. The creature said “sweetie are you going to be late for school?” In low almost mocking tone. Before I could fully comprehend the atrocious scene infront of me she lunged at me, her limps moved abnormally bending and twisting and ways that shouldn’t have been possible. She was on top of me almost instantaneously, I could feel her bony hand wrap around my throat. The grip slowly getting tighter and tighter. My airway was almost completely closed off and I was starting to pass out. I noticed out of the corner of my eye I noticed my coffee mug on the living room table. With all my remaining strength I reached out and grabbed the ceramic mug and slammed it against the creatures head. The mug shattered and the beast screeched in pain, with the tiny amount recoil from the monster I was able to shift position and slam the remaining shard into its head. The sharp edge went into the skull with a loud ripping sound as flesh and blood poured out the newly opened wound. At that point she was off balance enough I was able to break grip on my neck. I got up and decided I was done living with the burden of this monstrosity in my life.  For the first time in a long time I was gunna do something for me, I was going to rid myself of this horrid woman. I ran to the hallway closet, I can feel the creatures footsteps behind me. I didn’t have much time, I threw open the door and saw my old childhood baseball bat. I grabbed it and gripped the handle tightly and in one quick motion I flipped my hips and brought the bag down on the pale decrepit head of that thing. It made a loud pop just like when someone he’s that perfect home run, she slumped to the floor. I couldn’t tell if she was moving but I didn’t care, I wish I could tell you what happened next. I just blacked out, I just let bringing the bat down over and over and over again till my arms went numb. My arms were exhausted and I dropped the bat, I just took a step back and just saw a bloody mess of flesh and crimson all over the walls, floor and ceiling. I just packed a duffle bag, got in my car and drove to the air port. I decided to move far away from that house and try and escape just all the horrible things that had happened in that house. I found myself living in Las Vegas, in a nice quiet suburb. I actually did make something of my life I’m a firefighter and have a wife and a dog. I had just gotten home from my twenty four hour shift and just tossed myself on my bed to relax a bit. I was thinking to myself about how happy I was with how my life had been going. Just as I had begun to slowly drifting off for a quick power nap my dog shot up outta bed and started growling at my closest. I thought he was just being dramatic and heard the house settling, but then I heard a familiar knock from inside the closest. The end ",1,1764136646.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Recently was the icing on top, this man I meet in OLD who’s a few years older seems eager to go out with me.. asks my schedule seems flexible with when we go on a date eventually we make a plan and it threw me off he wasn’t recommending anything too fancy more casual settings and I ended up trying that out because I wanted a switch from the dinner dates. I get hints of him being cheap but go on to try to know him. Second date he picks me up and gives me flowers so I’m impressed that he was being romantic, we had kissed by the first date.
Fast forward we have a romantic ish date and then the next day he cold turkey says we won’t be a match because he can’t imagine me doing things like planning for, paying for dates, and getting him flowers stuff like that. We didn’t even do anything high effort honestly. And he didn’t spend much money on me at all. Maybe a coffee and a pizza he didn’t even offer to get me until I hinted that I was hungry too on a date. Also I never mentioned relationships with him. 

What in the actual world is going on?? Why does this keep happening? I need serious advice . I want to give up so bad and this isn’t helping. Please help. Thank you 
The last guy ended up telling me that he couldn’t afford a gf aka to give me what I needed after begging me to basically date him saying how much he likes me etc, still see him on apps lol. The guy before him said we weren’t a match also. The ex before that (a serious relation) ended up saying we’re not working out and are heading different ways in our lives and how he also can’t give me what I need . It’s a very common pattern.

Stats:

A/S/L: 30/Male/NYC. Not white and ESL.  
Education: undergrad degree in philosophy lel  
Parents: broke, works minimum wage.

Started applying to stuff after finishing college.

Recently got disqualified from trying to sell myself to army for some random medical reasons.

No known mental/physical illness. No criminal history. Never used any drugs or drunk alcohol and avoid coffee.

Though need to wear eyeglasses which got me disqualified from trying to join as NY state correction officer after they had a shortage of people.

I get out of breath if I need to talk a bit and my pronunciations of words are all fucked, so half the minimum wage with their ""excellent communication skills"" disqualifies me. I apply to everything on indeed dot com that I qualify for that are not clearly unethical.

I got ""hired"" 3 times. Once time was a scam online job that was trying to steal my non-existent money in bank eventually. The other was a grocery picker job from amazon thing that they used AI to hire and then after bunch of paperworks were told they already filled the position. The third one was cleaning job that the day before I have to show up said the job was 'cancelled by client'. 

I was interviewed one time. TJMax in upper Manhattan where the interviewer was busy or something so someone else wrote down my response to hand over. Oh another one called on phone for grocery packer, asked ""what does customer service mean to you"" and after my answer ""we'll let you know"".

Joblessness is technically not involuntary, there were 3 instance of people trying to get me in through with connection after seeing my parents going insane which I avoided since seems like stealing other people's job who wasted time applying.

I do have a driver's license mother made me get but I really shouldn't, I was saved by one point and it was a long time ago and probably forgot how to drive by now. Driving is surprisingly a very social activity and I fuck up everything social. Definitely don't have a car or bike to do anything with.

1p6zxiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1p6zxiy/advice_about_a_friend/,Advice about a 'friend',"I have a friend that I can't pin down if she is malicious or dumb or something else. I don't know what to do.

I met this friend at work two years ago and I always thought that she was weird. I would not hire her as an employee. She was lazy.  However, she is quite honest and what you see is what you get. 

I am undergoing chemotherapy and she offered me to help me. The first session she helped me, she was late and she took me to her house. Afterwards, when I suggested to do something active, she suggested to clean her spider webs, her old sofa, the top of the furniture in her room. I went along because I took it as a joke. However, inside me I directly dismissed her as friend and said to myself never again. The next session I avoid her, but she contacted me again late. The chemotherapy was already finished. She requested me to collect the prescription of her daughter while waiting for her. I bluntly refused and she still insisted.  I just faked headache and went home, no more talk.

I tried to avoid her, but she wanted to go to cinema. I gave her a chance. I was explicit not to be late. She still comes late and expects me to help her with her shopping and wait for her to smoke and go to the movie late by skipping the trailer. In that day, I said to her that she might have Asperger's or something like that. You don't ask someone after chemo to collect the prescription of your daughter when you are not even on time. You don't insist when someone says no.
She said she takes rejection very badly.

I said to myself maybe no more cinema as well, just coffee.
I gave her another chance to meet up for some food somewhere. Again she insisted that she wants to eat in her house take away. I went along but I said that I eat and leave. When we are in the house, she asked me to fix her wall clock that I said no. There was also a mouse with the cat, which she said to help her to catch it.  I said no my problem and she said thank you ironically. Then she asked me to rub cream on the back. I said ok just rub, if you need, you need. When I rubbed it, she asked me to do massage, that creams need massage in the muscle. I said no and she got kind of pissed that the cream goes with massage, which I didn't sign off.

She doesn't look malicious. She is quite straightforward. She believes that all this is normal. She also insists that I am her friend. She doesn't have friends. Maybe because she has low EQ.

After all these situations I want to cut her off. But I feel guilty. When discussing with my childhood friend, I said to tell her just coffee friends. My friend said that it is cruel to say that.

As i had no intentions of anything at the time, but this time I just answered and we talked for a good minute. They work at starbucks and i was going to come home from school for that weekend. So i just asked if i can get some free starbucks because why not right? Then they mention what were my plans that weekend, they asked me to go out with them on Sunday (mind you I only wanted Starbucks and maybe from there we can plan something later for another occasion) 

Anyways, the day comes by, we immediately start getting along as we clicked. We have went out on date around the beach. They told me that he smoked weed for fun and I really like to smoke weed as well—they mentioned that they can get us weed that we smoke and ofc i agreed because it’s free weed. We go to a pier while the plug gets to their house, mind you they’re acting very flirtatious by putting his hand over my shoulder and even held my hand at one point. They took pictures of me and my phone as we were playing air hockey at the arcade. After it was in the clear to get weed from the plus house, i learned that he plug is their best friend 😭😭. We go to a view by LAX to smoke this weed (it was really good omg), mind you he did that one smoke trick where you smoke into the other persons mouth and that’s exactly what he did. He asked to do it again and he made out with me….after we were a little high, they complimented me a lot by saying i was angelic, i was very beautiful, my face card never decline, blah blah. We make out a couple more times and cuddling. As we both seem to enjoy this experience (it was very intimate, even romantic)

Two days after our “date” idk. He texted me concerning about what had happened, as he apologized and felt he moved on too fast by making the situation uncomfortable. I reassured him that it’s fine and that i wasn’t uncomfortable. All he wanted was to catch up and understood that did happened, that i’m a great person but told me that everything he did had zero intentions for any of if it and that it felt right at the moment—this confuses me because wdym it was unintentional but felt right at the moment? Goes on by explaining it was out impulsively without knowing how it felt but he knows that he likes me. they didn’t want to keep this going on further and he wanted to be truthful to me, he also explains he didn’t want to entertain something that’s not there.  After all of that romantic date and all the other shit they did, they say “I hope there’s no hard feelings” 

I texted them a couple days later basically saying that ik they  said everything was too soon, but that’s i liked hanging out with them and i was wondering if we can do it again as friends, we can do something casual like coffee or something. Their answer was that hanging out was cool, I enjoyed it, but that shouldnt be going out rn, they’re trying prioritize school and themselves and said “Maybe some other time.”

Am i completely valid for being very pissed off as i thought this person was very attractive and we could’ve had something good? Be honest would it be stupid of me to wait or something? Maybe he’ll come back? pls help lol",1,1764135974.0,Situationships,1,1.0,False

Everyone’s got e-readers, AI summaries, or audiobook subscriptions.

But I can’t give up the feel of a real book. The creased spines, random notes from a stranger, a faint coffee stain on the edge — they all tell a story beyond the printed words.

A few months back, I found an old copy of *The Catcher in the Rye* from an online secondhand store. Inside the cover, there was a handwritten note:

It hit me hard. That small note connected me to someone I’ll never meet. You don’t get that with digital downloads.

Buying used books isn’t just about saving money — it’s about recycling stories, preserving memories, and keeping that tactile connection alive. Each book carries energy from the people who’ve held it before.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

When you think about unique living spaces, Arizona barndominiums stand out. These trendy homes offer a blend of rustic charm and modern comfort. The concept originated from repurposed barns but has evolved into stylish, fully functional residences. If you’re considering a move or a new build in Arizona, exploring barndominiums for sale can be an exciting venture.

What exactly are barndominiums? Simply put, they are metal or wood structures that combine the traditional barn look with the conveniences of a home. The key features that make these properties so desirable include:

- **Spacious Layouts:** Barndominiums typically feature open floor plans, allowing for abundant living space. You get that airy, relaxed feeling right when you step inside.
- **Customizable Designs:** Since these homes are often new builds, you have complete control over the layout, finishes, and any unique touches you'd like to implement.
- **Durability:** Built with strong materials, barndominiums are designed to withstand the elements. This is especially important in Arizona, where temperatures can soar.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Many barndominiums are equipped with energy-efficient appliances and insulation, reducing monthly energy bills.
- **Affordability:** Compared to traditional homes, barndominiums often come at a lower price point. This makes them an attractive option for first-time buyers or those looking to downsize.

Understanding pricing is crucial when considering Arizona barndominiums for sale. Depending on location, size, and features, prices can vary significantly. Listings typically start around $200,000 and can go upward to over $1 million. Below are some factors that influence pricing:

- **Location:** Proximity to urban areas or popular attractions can drive prices higher. Properties in secluded areas or off the beaten path generally cost less.
- **Size:** Larger barndominiums with multiple bedrooms and baths will obviously command higher prices.
- **Land:** The amount of land included with the barndominium influences the overall price. For those desiring a larger lot for future expansion, this is a crucial factor.
- **Quality of Construction:** Upgrades, like premium finishes and high-tech amenities, will raise costs. Investing in quality early can save on maintenance later.

One of the standout benefits of barndominiums is their versatility. Whether you need a cozy home for a small family or a larger one for entertaining, these structures can be adapted to fit your lifestyle. You might also consider converting part of the space into a workshop, studio, or guest suite, blending functionality with personal preference.

As you explore Arizona barndominiums for sale, keep in mind that the style and setting can vary greatly. Some may boast modern aesthetics with clean lines and large windows, while others maintain that classic barn look with rustic finishes, like wood accents and traditional roofing. This variety ensures that every buyer can find a property that resonates with their unique taste.

Additionally, barndominiums encourage a lifestyle that embraces outdoor living. Many properties come with vast patios, balconies, or decks that highlight the stunning Arizona landscapes. Imagine sipping coffee while watching the sunrise over the mountains or hosting summer barbecues under the stars. The lifestyle you can cultivate in a barndominium is a major draw for many buyers.

With their charm and practicality, Arizona barndominiums are more than just a housing trend; they represent a lifestyle choice. For those looking to make a move and invest in a unique living space, exploring the listings and prices can lead to discovering your dream home in this beautiful and vibrant state.

As demand for these properties grows, it's vital to act quickly when you find one that meets your needs. Working with a knowledgeable real estate agent can significantly improve your chances of securing the right barndominium in Arizona. They can guide you through the nuances of the market, helping you navigate listings and understand pricing. So whether you are ready to pack your bags or just browsing, the adventure of finding your perfect Arizona barndominium starts here.

Current Trends in Barndominium Pricing and Listings in Arizona
--------------------------------------------------------------

As the popularity of barndominiums continues to rise, particularly in Arizona, it's essential to understand the current trends in pricing and listings to help you make an informed purchasing decision. Barndominiums—a blend of barn and condominium—offer a unique living experience, combining rustic charm with modern amenities. By examining various factors like location, size, and design, you can gain insight into the evolving market of Arizona barndominiums for sale.

Many buyers are seeking the perfect balance of affordability and space, leading to an increase in diverse listings across the state. Based on recent data, here are key trends shaping the Arizona barndominium market:

- **Pricing Ranges:** Barndominium prices in Arizona typically range from $200,000 to over $700,000. Factors impacting price include square footage, land size, and location. Areas closer to urban centers may command higher prices.
- **Size Varieties:** Listings vary greatly in size, with many barndominiums featuring 1,200 to 3,000 square feet of living space. In rural areas, larger builds are becoming more common as families seek spacious, open layouts.
- **Custom Features:** Many buyers are looking for customization options. Features like high ceilings, open floor plans, and energy-efficient designs are increasingly popular to meet individual needs.
- **Neighborhood Appeal:** Location matters in real estate, and Arizona is no exception. Areas with stunning natural landscapes, like Prescott or Sedona, are attracting buyers eager for both beauty and adventure.
- **Investment Potential:** As more people recognize the appeal of barndominiums, they are viewed not just as homes but as investment opportunities. Purchasing a barndominium can generate rental income, especially in tourist-rich areas.

When searching for barndominiums for sale in Arizona, consider enlisting the help of a local real estate agent. Their knowledge of the area and awareness of current market trends can save you time and provide access to listings that meet your criteria. Additionally, keep an eye on online listings to stay updated on new properties entering the market.

Another significant factor to consider is the condition of the existing structures. Many barndominiums may be considered fixer-uppers, allowing you to customize the space while potentially increasing its value. Look for properties providing a solid foundation and good bones, as renovations can lead to a rewarding investment.

The mix of modern conveniences with traditional barn aesthetics offers a distinctive lifestyle that resonates with many. Open space, flexibility in design, and the combination of indoor and outdoor living are all compelling reasons why so many are drawn to barndominiums.

If you're set on finding a barndominium, focus on what is most important for you and your family. Are you more interested in outdoor space for activities or proximity to city life? Knowing your priorities will streamline your search and help you make a decision that fits your lifestyle.

Moreover, engaging with existing barndominium communities can provide insights into what it’s truly like to live in these unique homes. Online forums or local meet-ups allow you to ask questions and learn from the experiences of current owners. This type of peer interaction could lead to finding listings that perhaps are not heavily marketed yet.

Understanding current trends in pricing and listings is crucial when searching for Arizona barndominiums for sale. With the right research and support, you’ll be well on your way to finding a property that not only meets your needs but also embodies the charm that these homes offer. As interest in barndominiums remains strong, being proactive and well-informed will enhance your chances of making a successful purchase in this dynamic real estate market.

### Conclusion

With their spacious interiors and customizable layouts, barndominiums cater to diverse lifestyles—from cozy family retreats to vibrant working farms. The advantages of choosing a barndominium include energy efficiency and lower maintenance costs, making them an excellent investment for anyone seeking a long-term home.

Current market trends show a growing interest in barndominiums throughout Arizona, fueling a rise in listings. Buyers can find a range of prices that reflect various features, such as size, location, and amenities.

1p6zkjn,https://i.redd.it/1e72sfr16j3g1.jpeg,Haul Post: White Material,"

I am kind of feeling a little tired of collecting, or not tired of buying movies, but kind of oppressed by the amount of *stuff* that I have lugged into middle age (late middle age, even), and I have been thinking that I should be shifting my focus to curation rather than acquisition.  But over the weekend I had a little time to kill, and various things in my life made me feel the pull of retail therapy, so I ducked into a Barnes and Noble, where I elbowed my way through my fellow addicts and bought *White Material.*

I walked in looking for *3 Women*, which I think has been on my wishlist longer than any other  movie I don't already own.  Others had gotten there before me, but when I saw this I thought of the [Renate Reinsve closet video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAhUrrvwWPQ) in which she talks about how Claire Denis ""elevates everyday moments"" so that you perceive them with all your senses. And then Isabelle Huppert (as Denis points out in an interview on the disc) registers so much with her body; she reminds me of my daughters when they were small, and you saw emotions kind of reverberate through them before making it to their faces and their language.  

I was rewatching the Reinsve closet video because (I am somewhat embarrassed to admit) I have an infatuation with her that matches my early teen infatuations (Emma Thompson, Juliette Binoche, Ingrid Bergman). I am meant to be older and smarter now, and my feelings are certainly much more layered. But I will watch anything Reinsve is in and anything she tells me to watch, and so in Barnes and Noble I decided to choose one and only one, and that one was *White Material*.  

**What is the first movie you plan to watch from your haul and why?** *White Material*

The movie is told in a long flashback. There is a revolutionary movement in an unnamed country in Africa in which a figure called ""The Boxer,"" is a guiding philosophical inspiration.  This movement has inspired a lot of kids, who have armed themselves.  The government forces are trying to put down the rebellion.  But both government and rebels have decided that wealthy white landowners should go.  Early on, a helicopter flies by to tell Isabelle Huppert's character that the French Army is abandoning the country, and that French families should leave as soon as possible.  Isabelle Huppert does not leave.  Chaos ensues.

**Is there anything from this haul that you have been looking forward to owning for a long time?**  I had been thinking about buying it for about two months.  That was when I saw *Beau Travail* and bought it immediately, then added some other by Claire Denis to my wishlist. I also quite recently found out that she had worked on some of my favorite Wim Wenders movies.  

Claire Denis films are so tactile, but also something else.  I don't know how you dream, but in my dreams, space has kind of odd dimensions.  The places I inhabit in dreams can be cavernous, or loop back on themselves, or embody emotion in their multilayered constrictedness or their open immensity. So it's not just that *White Material* gives you a feeling for the humidity and labor and landscape and dust of a coffee plantation (the country is not named in the film, but it was shot in Cameroon), it also gives you two kinds of imaginary space.  The first is the colonial life of Huppert's character, Maria, who ignores the revolution happening around her because she finds her attachment to the land, to working the land, so convincing.  The second is the imaginative world of Denis herself, which is much harder to describe.  It is fuller than Maria's vision and seems to extend far beyond the images on the screen, but it is a space in which a certain kind of European paternalism has become impossible, where child soldiers see their dreams of a better life through the sights of their guns, where radio stations permeate and explain the changing politics.  In this strange kind of space, the things that colonializers own, and indeed the bodies of the colonizers, have become ""White Material,"" available for the taking. 

That's all probably too convoluted. Claire Denis made a movie in which a certain sense of belonging and connection becomes impossible, and did it in a way that you feel the space changing around you as you watch it. 

**Are any of your purchases blind buys? If so, why did you select them?** I don't totally understand what people mean by a blind buy.  By the time I purchased this I knew a lot about the director, had seen two of her other movies, and had a good idea of what to expect. And then Renate Reinsve worked her magic in my soul.

1p6zkcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1p6zkcl/is_my_mil_a_covert_narcissist/,Is my MIL a covert narcissist?,"I recently found out what a covert narcissist is and I think my MIL fits the bill???



1. Low self esteem. Lots of self deprecation and fat jokes.

2. Seemingly empathetic. She is seemingly empathetic and “sorry“ about my family troubles in front of the rest of the family. During our last spat, because I’ve had family troubles, it‘s like she thinks I‘m suffering?? SHE has no family trouble ofc. ;)

3. Passive aggressive. My spouse and I got married in June and she offered to make our welcome sign. Long story short, we felt like she was being difficult about it, we decided to order our own sign. She pops up and is like “I ordered this $300 sign on Etsy and my husband made a stand for it”, we’re like uhhhh, why $300 though? She blew up husband’s phone, asking him to come get the sign from her house. When he asked if we could just use one sign for ceremony and the other for the reception, her response was “there is no need for 2 signs. you guys already got what you wanted.” 

4. At work, she is the most competent. Everyone else doesn’t know what they’re doing and is a dumbass. 

5. Everyone else‘s marriage and kids are on the table, but her marriage? Nope. In her last 2 marriage, she is the victim of her exes. Her exes just didn’t want to be involved fathers etc. and she was just… there. 

6. Never any accountability. Never heard an apology or an “I’m sorry“ come from her mouth. We’ve had a lot of misunderstandings and I was always the one apologizing. She would just stand there and look at me lol. This really stood out to me when she made a racially insensitive remark, I let her know it was offensive, and she insisted it was a joke. 

7. Whenever I’ve tried to have conversations with her about our relationship and why it doesn’t exist, I am attacking her, I am looking for a fight. She will completely stop engaging with me and go text my husband. It gives “I’m gonna tell your husband what you said.” As if my husband is unaware? She also has done the, “let’s have dinner but your partner isn’t invited“ kinda thing. 

8. Mixed signals and constant uncertainty. Even in the early stages of us getting to know one another, I always felt like I was apart of this game. We’d hang out or go get coffee, then all of a sudden she was really busy, so I’d stop asking. When I’d see her in person, very passive aggressive comments or jokes, and dirty looks. You would’ve thought I was the other woman lol. I felt tension, always asking if I did something wrong, and felt like she never did anything to reassure me. 

9. Idk what to call this, but 2 months before our wedding, she texts my husband one morning, asking if I’m on antidepressant because she‘s noticed “signs”. She meant no harm asking this, she was only asking out of concern. Then she called him, insisting she meant no harm and that she had to be hospitalized once. My husband let her know it was none of her business and later told me he felt like maybe she was trying to plant this seed that I’m some crazy, unstable person before we got married.

1p6zifd,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1p6zifd/my_catering_tasting_was_a_disaster_what_to_do/,"My catering tasting was a disaster, what to do?","We are 5 months out from our wedding and had our catering tasting today. This caterer is partnered with our venue and their catering package is included with our venue package. They are the only option for caterers within our package, but I did my research and found them to be well-reviewed before I signed the contract.

This tasting was scheduled two months ago for 4 people (bride, groom, bride's parents) and when we arrived the woman was surprised there were four of us and kind of hinted that we had brought more people than we were supposed to (we didn't, my contract say 4 as did the calendar appointment). We were not given plates to eat off of. We ate off of napkins and cold tortillas. Tiny portions of cold food were served to us. It looked extremely unappetizing and I could tell it was cold just by looking at it. We tried fajita chicken which was cold and had a weird seasoning on it, fajita beef which was cold and tasted freezer burnt, grocery store tortillas STRAIGHT out of the package, like Mission brand, not warmed or steamed or anything - ice cold. And the employee said they could not serve them warm at the wedding because they would stick together, so this is how they would be served at the wedding. The peppers and onions for the fajitas were on a plate with cold items and had clearly been refrigerated and were served refrigerator cold and not hot. 

We also tried cold pulled pork in questionable chunks with the nastiest BBQ sauce I have ever tasted. The only thing that was remotely passable was a grilled chicken breast that was the only item served even slightly warm. The employee said that the main chef was ill today and he was the only one who could answer questions about packages and pricing. She was referring to non-venue packages not included in our contract, tried to discourage us from getting the coffee included in our package, and couldn't answer any questions at all. I inquired about one of the other menu options and she had never heard of it. I felt rushed she even got up and pushed in her chair to leave before I was finished asking questions.

The food was literally a 2 out of 10. I know that not all catering will be a 10 because food cooked at scale tends to lose a little quality but the food should at least be like a 7 out of 10. I would never serve this to my guests in a million years. It was honestly terrible and I don't know what to do. I've been very happy with the venue itself so I sent them an email asking for a phone call to discuss and figure out a solution. My contract/payment relationship is with the venue, not the catering company itself. I honestly don't know what to do because I feel like I'm trapped into this contract with a terrible catering company. The only saving grace might be if it was only terrible today because the chef was ill and perhaps the woman who helped us today doesn't normally cook. At minimum I am going to ask for another tasting with the main chef.

Any other thoughts on what I can do?

Hi guys, I don’t even know if this belongs here or not, so apologies in advance.

This all started when I went to my friend’s family function and she(24f) was there too. We knew of each other from college but never really talked or even said hi. On the day of the function, we both got very drunk and ended up having a random verbal fight nothing serious, just drunk nonsense. I was blackout drunk, so I didn’t remember anything.

The next day, I felt guilty and asked a friend for her number so I could apologise. Since then, we’ve been talking, and I like her a lot. I’ve been flirting with her, she knows it, and she plays along. She talks comfortably and never gets weird about it.

We’ve met a few times — 2–3 times for walks, and once for a proper coffee outing where we talked for 2–3 hours. But sometimes she says I don’t know her well enough. Some days she gives a lot of energy and we talk till 4 a.m., and other days she just sends stickers to keep the conversation going.

She also told me earlier that she came out of a 9-year relationship this year and still hasn’t gotten full closure. So I’m not sure if that’s affecting how she responds.

I’m confused about how to proceed because this is the first time in my life I’ve talked to a girl this much or hung out with a girl alone. I really like her and want to pursue her, but sometimes it feels like she wants something and sometimes it feels like she doesn’t. She has told me she hates forced conversations, yet she still keeps ours going.

We haven’t talked on the phone yet mainly because


 I don’t know how to ask her. What should I do?


TL; DR :

Met a girl at a friend’s function, got drunk and argued, apologised the next day, and we’ve been talking since. I like her and she flirts back; we’ve met a few times and had long conversations, but her energy is inconsistent. Some days she talks till 4 a.m., other days she just sends stickers. She also recently came out of a 9-year relationship and still doesn’t have closure, so I’m not sure how to move forward. This is my first time talking to a girl this much, and I don’t know what the next step should be",1,1764134695.0,RelationshipIndia,2,1.0,False

1p6zfyf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p6zfyf,"Homemade Pumfu! Soy-free, one ingredient, zero waste super easy homemade tofu recipe","Pumfu was posted here recently, the commercial brand of soy-free tofu made from pumpkin seeds. It's really not that cheap, but if you can't eat soy this is the best tofu replacement. It is not as widely available as soy tofu though. My local Stop and Shop used to carry it but got rid of it during the pandemic, so I made my own.

I found 20oz of pumpkin seeds for $12 at my supermarket, which yields approximately 10oz of tofu, but you also get milk and the pulp from it. So $12 for a block of tofu, milk and crackers is not a bad deal.

It's stupid easy to make, even easier than soy tofu because it doesn't need a coagulating agent. I rarely make tofu at home so I don't have the right equipment, and I was still able to make amazing pumfu. There are no strict quantities, use whatever quantity of pumpkin seeds you can get your hands on, it's about the process of straining and cooking it. Just make sure to use raw pumpkin seeds, not roasted or salted.

Youtube video from Mary's Test Kitchen for a video guide: https://youtu.be/OkdEV_XRdkg?si=xUDyulzZ68DTEnrA

1. Start by soaking raw pumpkin seeds overnight, or 8 to 12 hours until fully hydrated.

2. Drain the pumpkin seeds and cover with fresh water.

3. Blend the soaked pumpkin seeds and fresh water on the highest setting available until very fine and no large bits remain.

4. Strain the blended pumpkin seed liquid over your cooking vessel. Ideally use a nutmilk bag, but I used cheesecloth and it still worked fine (pic 3).

5. Bring the pumpkin seed liquid to a gentle boil over medium heat. Stir frequently to prevent sticking, and the liquid will start to curdle and form chunks as it boils (pic 4).

6. When the liquid has coagulated into large chunks after around 15 minutes (watch it closely for when chunks stop forming) ladle out the curds into a container and press into a single layer. A tofu press is ideal, but I don't have a tofu press so I used a Pyrex container with a paper towel and a large book on top to weigh it down. Let chill overnight. The next day drain off any liquid, and enjoy your homemade pumfu!

The liquid remaining after you boil and strain out the curds can be cooled and used as milk. It has a very mildly sweet pumpkin flavor, it is delicious in coffee! Or use in baked goods, or however you would use storebought plant milk. It will start to separate after a few hours, just shake it up again. Add any flavoring or sweetener you want, although I don't think it needs any.

Full written recipe with more detail from Mary's Test Kitchen: https://www.marystestkitchen.com/pumpkin-seed-tofu/

To make this recipe zero waste, you can make crackers from the remaining pumpkin seed pulp: https://www.marystestkitchen.com/vegan-cool-ranch-crackers/ the crackers were a bit bitter tasting in my opinion, but I still ate them all so they weren't too bad. You could definitely add other flavors, or use the pulp in muffins or bread or something else, or dip in hummus or other flavorful dips.",25,1764134613.0,EatCheapAndVegan,5,1.0,False

Challenge accepted.

The file wasn’t on any legit service—some sketchy link buried in a forum thread—but it played fine on my laptop.  
Static at first, then grainy footage of a small, dim apartment.

For the first twenty minutes, nothing happened.  
The camera never moved. The apartment stayed empty.

I checked the progress bar. Two hours long.  
“Come on,” I muttered. “Do something.”

Onscreen, the apartment lights flickered once, like they’d heard me.  
The bathroom door at the back of the frame stood slightly open.

I leaned closer.  
There was something… familiar about the layout. Couch, crooked lamp, tiny kitchen visible on the left.

My phone buzzed with a text from a friend asking if I’d chickened out yet.  
I sent back a selfie: laptop glow on my face, movie paused on a frame of the empty room.

He replied immediately. **Cool filter. How’d you get it to match your place?**  

I frowned and looked between the screen and my living room.  
Same cheap lamp. Same chipped coffee table. Same faint water stain on the far wall.

I hadn’t noticed the stain in the movie until I looked for it.  
But there it was, identical to the one behind my TV.

I hit play again.  
Onscreen, the front door—my front door—came into view as the camera auto-adjusted exposure.

A timestamp in the corner updated in real time.  
I checked my microwave clock. Same minute, same seconds ticking by.

Someone walked into frame.  
I watched myself drop my keys in the bowl by the door, kick off my shoes, and sit down on the couch.

My muscles locked.  
The “me” on screen opened a laptop and clicked something. Static rolled over the image for half a second, then cleared.

Now the me in the movie was watching a movie, too—my posture, my expression, my nervous laugh when nothing happened.  
He checked his phone, took the same selfie I’d just taken, and sent it.

The view zoomed in slowly, like whoever held the camera stepped toward me from somewhere very close.  
I whipped my head around the room. No one.

Onscreen, over my shoulder, a shape leaned out of the bathroom doorway—long fingers gripping the frame, a head tilted at an unnatural angle.  
The version of me on the laptop screen didn’t see it.

My real bathroom door, in my real apartment, creaked open behind me.  
The movie glitched, freezing on a frame of both of us—screen-me and real-me—turning our heads in perfect sync toward the same point just off camera, where the viewer sat.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Ottawa Senators vs. Vegas Golden Knights: A Tale of Golden Eggs and Sensational Underdogs**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a hockey clash that’s as much about math as it is about madmen on ice. On November 26, 2025, the Vegas Golden Knights (-1.5) host the Ottawa Senators (+1.5) in a game that’s as lopsided on paper as a pizza box left in the snow. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Zamboni and the wit of a locker-room roast.

---

### Parsing the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (But They Do Tickle)

The Vegas Golden Knights are the clear favorites here, with decimal odds hovering around **1.56-1.61** (implying a **60-65% implied probability** of victory). The Senators, meanwhile, are priced at **2.35-2.45** (a **38-41% chance**), which is about the same odds as betting your coffee order will survive a barista’s “creative interpretation.”

The spread tells an interesting story: Vegas is favored by **1.5 goals**, meaning bookmakers expect them to win comfortably. For Ottawa to “cover,” they’d need to either win or lose by one goal—a task as likely as a penguin coaching a hockey team to the Stanley Cup.

The totals line sits at **5.5 goals**, with the Over/Under priced tightly between **1.83-1.98**. Given the league’s recent penchant for high-scoring chaos (see: Florida’s 8-3 romp, Utah’s 5-1 drubbing of Vegas), this game might lean Over. Imagine a popcorn machine compared to these teams’ recent output.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and the Ghost of Puck Past

Vegas enters this game reeling after a **5-1 loss to Utah**, where they managed just one goal—their offensive output about as impressive as a deflated air hockey table. Star forward Ivan Barbashev, who scored that lone goal, is likely still fuming. The Knights’ defense, meanwhile, has been leakier than a sieve in a monsoon.

Ottawa, on the other hand, eked out a **2-1 win over the Los Angeles Kings** in their last game, proving they can steal a victory when it matters. While they lack star power, their “grind-it-out” style is the hockey equivalent of a slow cooke

1p6yyoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1p6yyoh/advice_studied_comedians_so_you_dont_have_to_how/,[Advice] Studied comedians so you don’t have to: how to be well-read and scary quick-witted,"It’s wild how some people can drop niche historical references, quote a philosopher, and roast someone all in one sentence. Ever wondered how stand-up comics, writers, podcasters, and even late-night hosts seem to *know everything* AND make it sound clever or funny? It’s not magic or some genius gene. It’s a system. And it’s actually learnable.

Too many of us walk around thinking we’re ""not smart enough"" or “not funny” when really, we were just never taught how to build a sharp, witty mind. Even worse, most of the advice online is either vague influencer-talk or ""just read more books"" with zero context.

So this post pulls together what actually works, based on real insights from cognitive science, comedy writers, and top-tier thinkers from books, YouTube, and podcasts. No fluff. No pop psych TikTok clichés. Just real tools to help you read better, think faster, and speak sharper.

Here’s the playbook:

- **Read like a polymath, not a professor.** Great comedians and thinkers (like Jon Stewart, Bo Burnham, Hasan Minhaj) don’t stick to one genre. They read across politics, classics, pop culture, memoir, even Reddit threads. Try the “Rule of 3”: one book to learn (e.g., *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari), one to think (e.g., anything by James Baldwin), and one to feel (e.g., a novel or memoir). A 2019 report from Pew Research shows people who read fiction regularly score higher in emotional intelligence and mental flexibility. That’s the base for humor and insight.

- **Write every day like it’s a joke setup.** Smart comedians journal not just to vent, but to notice. That’s where quick wit starts. Use the “observation-punchline” format. Example: “Why is it that every coffee shop in a bookstore assumes I want to drink burnt milk while reading Nietzsche?” Training this helps sharpen your pattern recognition, which according to neuroscientist Dr. Scott Barry Kaufman (The Psychology Podcast), is key to both intelligence and humor.

- **Steal from the best thinkers and remix.** Tim Urban (*Wait But Why*), Lex Fridman, Fran Lebowitz, and Ricky Gervais, their minds are libraries. Comedians like John Mulaney obsessively read biographies and screenplays. They collect phrases, perspectives, trivia. Make a ""mental swipe file"" on Notion or a notes app where you save weird facts, quotes, and ideas. It’s like improv training for your brain.

- **Practice riffing with smart people.** Witty people don’t always *think faster*, they just *practice talking better*. Join book clubs, online discourse spaces, or debate groups. Improv coach Brian Palermo told *Hidden Brain* that “spontaneity is a skill, not a personality trait.” Verbal agility is built through social reps, not just solo reading.

- **Consume smarter content, but make it fun.** Yes, watch stand-up. But also mix in long-form pods like *The Ezra Klein Show*, *SmartLess*, or *Conversations with Tyler*. These blend high-level ideas with humor. A 2022 MIT study found that exposure to varied, articulate content can measurably increase verbal fluency and metaphor usage over time.

- **Use analogy as your secret weapon.** Comedians like Nate Bargatze or Sarah Silverman are masters of this. They take one domain (like technology) and link it to something random (dating, toddlers, 90s cartoons). Analogical reasoning is *the lever* for humor and insight. According to *Cognition* journal, analogical thinkers outperform others on problem-solving and persuasion tasks.

- **Slow down to speed up.** Ironically, quick-witted people often *pause more*. Dead air gives room for sharper phrasing. Dave Chappelle’s iconic silences are studied by performance coaches because they build tension and show control. Don’t rush to be clever. Control the pace, and the timing becomes part of the wit.

- **Train your brain like athletes train legs.** Use tools like Readwise, Glasp, and Anki to retain what you read. Refreshing information rewires your brain. The forgetting curve is real, and no amount of “reading” matters unless you revisit the content. Comedians retain bits through repetition. So should you.

- **Notice your voice and filter less.** Most people are funnier and smarter than they seem. But they overthink. The best comics talk like they're thinking out loud. Practice talking *through* an idea instead of *about* it. That’s how you find punchlines and insights mid-sentence. Podcasts like *You Made It Weird* and *Good One* show behind-the-scenes of this process.

- **Cut dead words. Sharpen syntax.** Smart speech isn’t about big words, it’s about precise ones. Start editing your thinking like writing copy. Instead of “it was kind of like a weird situation but sort of funny,” say “It was awkward. So I laughed.” That’s the secret sauce of fast thinkers. They think in structure. Then fill it with flavor.

No, not everyone will be a Carlin or Fey. But you can absolutely train a mind that reads fast, thinks sharp, and makes people laugh or respect you at the same time.

You don’t need permission to be well-read or witty. You just need a system.",1,1764133098.0,AtlasBookClub,0,1.0,False
1p6yy07,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1p6yy07/is_a_tablet_stand_worth_it_for_daily_use/,Is a tablet stand worth it for daily use?,"You've probably found yourself holding your tablet with one hand while trying to eat, type, or do literally anything else with the other. It gets old fast. Your neck starts hurting from looking down, your arms get tired, and watching a full movie becomes an uncomfortable workout.

That's where a tablet stand comes in handy.

**What Does a Tablet Stand Actually Do?**

A tablet stand holds your device at a comfortable angle so you don't have to. Simple as that. You can watch videos, follow recipes in the kitchen, join video calls, or read without constantly propping it against random objects that keep falling over.

The better stands let you adjust the angle and height. This means you can set it up perfectly whether you're sitting at a desk, lying in bed, or cooking in the kitchen.

**Real Benefits You'll Actually Notice**

Your neck and shoulders will thank you. Looking down at a flat tablet for hours puts strain on your body. An adjustable tablet holder keeps the screen at eye level, which makes a huge difference if you use your device regularly.

Multitasking becomes way easier too. Need to follow a recipe while cooking? Your tablet stays put and splatter-free. Taking notes during a video call? Your hands are free to type. Gaming or drawing? The stable base gives you better control.

**Who Actually Needs One?**

If you use your tablet for more than just quick browsing, you'll benefit from a stand. Students doing online classes, people who work from home, anyone who watches a lot of content, or folks who video chat with family will find it useful.

Even casual users notice the difference. Once you try watching your shows hands-free at the perfect angle, going back to holding your tablet feels ridiculous.

**Are They Worth the Money?**

Most decent tablet stands cost less than a few coffees. You're looking at a small investment that you'll use every single day. The cheap ones work fine for basic use, while pricier options offer more adjustability and sturdier materials.

Think about how often you use your tablet. If it's daily, spending a bit on comfort and convenience makes sense. Check out some [quality tablet stands here](https://athomewave.com/tablet-stand) to see what fits your needs.

**Things to Consider**

Make sure the stand fits your tablet size. Most are adjustable, but double-check the specifications. Look for non-slip bases if you have a slippery desk, and consider portability if you want to move it between rooms.

Material matters too. Metal stands are sturdier but heavier. Plastic ones are lighter and cheaper but might not last as long.

**Bottom Line**

A tablet stand isn't some fancy gadget you don't need. It's actually practical for daily use. The comfort improvement alone makes it worthwhile, and the hands-free convenience adds real value to how you use your device.

If you're tired of awkwardly holding your tablet or dealing with neck pain, browse through [these options](https://athomewave.com/tablet-stand) and pick one that works for your setup. Your future self will appreciate it.",1,1764133038.0,UmmProducts,0,1.0,False

Prior to my job now I was working HVAC for about 6 years, to say the least I was miserable.. Hated my boss, hated just feeling like I wasn't doing any fulfilling, hated that someone said I was going to be a lifer.. Fast forward too 2018, I took the leap, after doing some code academy and attempting to teach myself the basics of code, I applied and was accepted to do a 12 week immersive web dev program in Boston (General Assembly). Right before going to this program, my girlfriend at the time was a dental hygienist, she was making small talk with a client and he mentioned he was a software engineer. She mentioned how i was going to be going to an immersive program in Boston, he gave her his number for me to contact him, i did, we met up for coffee and talked goals and web dev in general. Fast forward to the 10th week of my program, I get a call from that guy and he asked if I wanted interview. I interviewed it was your typical interview but I feel like they were pretty relaxed about it because they knew how green I was. I mean shit, i'm pretty sure the tech challenge they let me use my own personal project I developed through the program.. Anyways they hired me probably believing they could mold me into what they wanted, although there wasnt much molding, there was a lot of extremely late nights of me trying to figure things out because I knew absolutely NOTHING. Long story short there were grueling years of teaching myself a lot but also kind of only teaching myself stuff that would get me through a specific task. I feel like I never really took a step back and really dove into soft skills or design concepts or why you would use a certain pattern for certain scenarios..

Now, 8 years later I'm still at my current company and over the past 3 my company as a whole does not feel secure. I've survived big layoffs, clients leaving, entire company not getting raises, etc. I have a family now, I own a house, and I need security.. I've had one job interview over the past year and I completely botched it. The technical interview I froze, it was plain javascript and I couldn't solve it.. I was so embarrassed and couldn't believe it. Now I feel like if it was nextjs and my companies codebase? I wouldn't have had any issues what so ever because i've been working here for so long and I feel like my knowledge of nextjs is very good but thats not going to cut it if I want a new job, which obviously I do with more security.. Just getting an interview almost seems impossible though, then I'm dreading the whole interview process because quite frankly I feel like my soft skills, tech terminology, and overall understanding of frontend development is lacking and I'm so used to my companies codebase I feel like im going to be a deer in headlights during an interview process.

I just need some advice on how I should go about getting a new job, do I zoom out and go back to strengthening my soft skills of javascript, do I use some platforms like TheGreatFrontend? What are some concepts companies are absolutely looking for that I should either learn or freshen up on? Any advice would be helpful. Please try your best not to tear me apart, I'm a anxiety filled mess at the moment with the thought of losing my job, I have 2 month old baby, a house, and an income needed for us to live.",4,1764132759.0,cscareerquestions,3,0.84,False

The call was long (about an hour or more) but I wasn’t talking loudly. (I didn’t have earbuds on) I was using a normal speaking voice around the same volume I’d use if someone were sitting across from me. This Coffee Bean is one I specifically choose because it’s usually noisy, with people chatting and laughing. It’s not a study café or quiet café.

Out of nowhere, a woman in her 50s/60s walked over and tapped me multiple times on the arm/shoulder and said, “Be quiet, could you be quiet?”  And did the hush 🤫 and said be quiet in English. The tapping felt really rude as I don’t like physical touch and unnecessary. She wasn’t even sitting right next to me and if she did then it would make sense that I might be noisy but she was like one table away from me.

I just stared at her because I was shocked at the multiple taps and I felt like my boundaries was like crossed despite that I did lower my voice. Then she started mumbling in Korean, “Noisy, noisy, so noisy,” like I was some nuisance. If she wanted a silent environment, she could have moved or gone to a quieter café. That’s what I do when I need to concentrate.

She then went to the part-timer and asked them to tell me to be quiet. The worker approached me and I told them I understood, but this is a public café and the whole place is noisy, not just me.

The lady jumped in again and said, “I usually don’t say anything, but for an hour you were calling and you’re so noisy. I was listening to your conversation and I heard a few swear words. It was scary.” Her tone was pretty harsh. I told her my conversation is my private business, and that I didn’t appreciate her touching me. I also said if it was too noisy for her, she could move or go home. She did say sorry for touching me but sounded sarcastic but I could be reading too much into that so I just let it go. 

Before she left, her husband or bf game and she told him that , “I don’t know what country she is  from, and I understand people make calls, but she has no manners and is rude” Tbh there were alot of people laughing and talking in a loud voice.

Was it really rude and is it not good to call in a cafe in Korea??? I just want to know cuz if I was the nuisance then id like to prevent instances like this. ",10,1764132411.0,Living_in_Korea,112,0.6,False

I bought this from importer Wilson Daniels maybe 5 years ago. I've been a fan of Elvio Cogno's Barolo. They typically have a lot of character, aromatic lift and complexity.  This is a more concentrated example, and a bit more modern in style than I have had from him. If you told me he blended 5% barbera in this I'd believe you (other than its a DOCG Barolo).  

Site > Medium garnet. concentrated ruby core fading to a medium garnet rim

medium, slow tearing with some staining, indicating concentration w/ alcohol in check. 

Aroma > Medium  intensity of blood orange, crunchy red and dark fruits (red and dark cherry) almost candied like a jolly rancher; herbal (fern oregano),  mineral (ink, wet volcanic rock) and secondary of coffee bean, cigar box, and toasted cedar, and tertiary of (dried leaves, balsamic). 

On the palate >Dry, high acidity, high chalky tannins, medium alcohol, medium plus body, and flavors echoing the nose but at higher intensity. The finish is a medium plus of dark cherry and coffee bean The acidity, tannin and concentration of this wine tells me it could develop another 5 years. 

Conclusion >I'll spare you the WSET quality judgement for this wine since it is technically outstanding, but for Barolo drinkers it might miss the mark a bit at this age and price point. The complexity is there, as is the intensity and finish, but the concentration steps on the wine a bit. It just doesn't have that lift I often get from aged Barolo. It's certainly enjoyable but maybe it was the vintage (warmer?) or he experimented with a modern approach this year. 

I recently had a 1997 Gaja Sperss, which this wine's aromas, flavors and texture remind me of, but the Sperss had that critical lift. it just danced in the nose. This is more heavy footed. 

The heavy foot causes me to score it 93, otherwise easy 95+ ",8,1764131771.0,wine,1,0.91,False

1p6yebq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p6yebq,Title: Two Small but Important QoL Changes Warframe Really Needs,"**Note:** I’m using ChatGPT to translate this post, since my native language is Portuguese and Reddit generally requires English.



I believe there are two “small” changes that would greatly improve the game:



# 1 — The Mission Statistics Screen Needs a Rework

The current stats screen puts way too much emphasis on **damage dealt**.  
I understand Warframe isn’t a traditional trinity-style game (tank/support/DPS), but it’s frustrating when you play something like **Harrow**, buffing critical chance, fire rate, energy, health, immunity — basically *making coffee and frying eggs for the squad* — and in the end it still feels like you were “carried” because another player dealt **80% of the total damage**, which is the stat shown most prominently.

I think the game should highlight **positive contributions**, such as:

– Crowd control  
– Buff uptime  
– Damage prevented  
– Healing given  
– Aggro generation  
– Objective-specific roles

Not everything in Warframe is damage, and the stats screen should reflect that.



# 2 — Loadout-Specific Gear Wheels (Extremely Needed)

This one is far more important:  
The **Gear Wheel (consumable loadout)** should be **linked to each equipment loadout** individually.

Casual players may not even use multiple loadouts, but for those who do, it’s a problem:

If I switch from a **mining loadout** to an **Eidolon hunting loadout**, there’s no reason for me to carry a mining drill.  
If I switch from **Eidolons** to **Void Fissures**, there’s no need to bring the Archwing Launcher.  
You end up with a Gear Wheel full of items, even though *most of them are useless for the mission you're running*.

Gear Wheel configurations should be **saved per loadout**, just like weapons and mods.",0,1764131315.0,Warframe,3,0.29,False
