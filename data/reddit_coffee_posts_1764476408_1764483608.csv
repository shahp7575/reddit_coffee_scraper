I’m just coming here to ask if anyone knows any recipes that aren’t super strenuous/time consuming to make, while also being affordable. Or even if you know of prepackaged or instant food that’s fairly cheap, I’m just having trouble with finding a lot. I can cook and do more complex stuff in short bursts for meal prepping if needed. 

I will add I have an allergy to any part of a nightshade plant aside from the roots, so no tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, etc, but potatoes are okay. I am also allergic to olives, coffee, and corn. I have a gastrointestinal condition so I’m not able to eat excessive fibre, no raw vegetables, and most beans have to be heavily moderated. 

Additionally if anyone has any favourite appliances or cookware that they think would make this easier, I would appreciate it. Money is tight but if something will help save money and spoons in the long run I can try to work something out.

Thank you in advance for any advice or recipes ❤️ I am trying my best to make the transition to eating vegan as quickly as possible since I’ve gotten my doctors on board with it!",1,1764483583.0,AskVegans,0,1.0,False

1pab2bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1pab2bm/i_just_need_strength/,I just need strength.,"Hi friends. I have recently ( alittle over a year) became a true follower of Christ. As a child, we went to church a few times a year. I have been teaching my babies about the word of God & everything he does for us. There past couple of weeks has had me feeling like there is something I am not doing right? Like I am seeking some sort of guidance through this…

We have been through an absolute $hit storm the past few days trying to find a way to eat. Today I had a shift from 6am to 5pm. I wanted to make sure I got off earlier so I can pick up the babies & head to the food pantry. Welp to my surprise , we get there & they are closed until Monday & the only one open tomorrow is the next town over and I just don’t have the gas to make it. My head is going to exploded.

I feel like I am doomed & it’s humiliating. I am so freaking exhausted working so hard that some days I can’t afford basic necessities. We moved a few years ago due to my job position & after escaping domestic abu$e from my ex-partner (still incarcerated thankfully). I make over the threshold for government assistance & have applied for child-support but doesn’t make a dent in anything. I literally PRAY that my babies see how freaking hard I am trying for them. Mama is tired, exhausted & overwhelmed doing this by myself. My family is non-existent after I cut them off financially from moving. When will this get easier ? I am hopeful that God will truly show me the path I am suppose to be on & teaching my kids that nothing would be possible with Him.

I am disappointed in myself. My elderly neighbor brought us two frozen Hot Pockets & a bag of oranges until I can find a solution. I’m tired of crying. I need sleep. I need coffee. I need my bible. I need peace. I just want my babies to know that I’m doing my best. God truly knows the amount I have on my plate. Never give up friends. Talk to God. He is listening.",1,1764483114.0,Christianity,2,1.0,False

Like my body is being flooded with happy chemicals. Kinda like when you drink a coffee (haven’t done that in awhile but from what I remember). Or like the high that people get from spicy food (is that also histamine related?). 

It’s crazy because all my life, most of my favorite/staple foods have been high histamine. Tomatoes, say sauce flavored crackers, miso soup with tofu, yogurt, bone broth. Anything fermented or with a lot of vinegar. Avocado. Nooch. Heavy on the yogurt and miso. I think I ate those every day of my life for 15 years. And I’ve always had insomnia and brain fog and fatigue (recently I developed ME/CFS however after a brain injury which is when I started paying attention to histamine content of foods). 

It’s so counter intuitive because not only are these foods supposed to be healthy but they also taste the best AND put happy chemicals in my brain. But when I cut them all out I started improving 😔",1,1764482816.0,HistamineIntolerance,0,1.0,False
1paayd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1paayd2/i_31f_am_seriously_considering_leaving_my_husband/,"I, 31F, am seriously considering leaving my husband, 38M. How do I navigate this complicated situation?","Ok, so I suppose that I am just going to jump right in... We have been together for 8 years, married for 5. We began dating in 2017 when I was 23 and he was 30. (I know.) We got married in 2020.

I’m noticing a strong and ever-growing sense of aversion towards my husband, especially lately. Certain behaviors or habits that I used to overlook or not even notice now make me feel instinctively repelled, like my body and emotions are pulling away before my mind even has a chance to process it. It’s affecting how connected I feel… and I don't feel the desire to reconnect. 

I feel like I shoulder most, if not all, of the responsibility in our household. I manage the chores, take care of our cat, make appointments, do the shopping, plan meals, remind him of the things he needs to do (which he doesn’t do), and generally figure out what needs to be done to keep our lives running. It feels exhausting and heavy, and I notice it affects how I feel about the relationship overall. These are things that I have brought up with him multiple times over the years.

For a long time, I put my feelings on pause because my mental health was extremely poor. I didn’t want to make any big decisions or rock the boat while I was struggling, so I focused on surviving rather than fully evaluating the relationship. Now that I’m doing much better (and also putting in time, effort, and talking with him about my issues with our relationship) the underlying feelings of disconnection and aversion haven’t gone away. They’re still very present, and I can’t ignore them anymore.

He has always struggled with insecurity in our relationship, and that became much more pronounced after I tried to leave in 2021. That insecurity itself now triggers a strong sense of aversion in me. I also feel like the rift between us has widened since I got my newish job.  I’m now experiencing social interactions with people who like and appreciate me, being in an environment that is less stressful than home, and realizing just how much I let our relationship isolate me. Instead of being supportive of my success, he often focuses on his own frustrations about not being able to find a job he enjoys. I recognize that his feelings are valid, but he hasn’t taken meaningful steps to improve the situation. On top of that, he gets very jealous of my male coworker and becomes moody when I try to spend time with my co-workers outside of work. They are good people that are inviting me into their close-knit circle, and I crave their friendship so badly. I feel like I constantly have to explain myself to him to the point of exhaustion. 

We absolutely have/had times that I feel like he's my best friend and those times are undeniably fun. I definitely have echoes of love for him, so this whole situation is so painful.

I can tell that he feels me pulling away, so recently he's become more helpful, etc... but to me it feels like too little too late. ""Where was this energy all along? Why does it feel like he only acts like he cares when he feels like he's losing me?""

Here's a list that I've been working on to show to my therapist:

**1. Emotional disconnection**

* I’ve felt emotionally “half out the door” for about four years, high-anxiety attachment prior to that.
* The relationship hasn’t felt fulfilling or intimate for a long time. (And even when it did, in retrospect it was so very laced with the anxiety of “proving” that I loved him.)
* I often feel empty, lonely, and disconnected from him. But also somehow overwhelmed due to not having the space or time to do things just for me uninterrupted.
* Feeling of being denied an equal partner, but also smothered by constant chatter and having to always break from what I'm doing so he can show me something, etc.

**2. Longstanding issues**

* We almost broke up in 2021, but he begged me to stay.
* Even after staying, we fought way less and some things improved. I have given it so much time and effort.
* I’ve tried talking to him about our intimacy issues, my emotional needs, wanting independence, and feeling disconnected.
* He said he wanted to work on things, but nothing actually meaningfully changed.  

**3. Lack of intimacy**

* I don’t want sex with my husband.
* Our sex life hasn’t never been good or satisfying, and I haven’t felt invested or seen in years, if ever.
* I’m touch-starved and craving passion, affection, desire, and physical connection, but not with him.
* I want more affection, appreciation, physical touch, excitement, and partnership than this relationship gives me.  

**4. Feeling like I outgrew the version of myself who entered this relationship**

* He’s my first serious relationship and the only person I’ve slept with... and like i said it's not great.
* I feel like I didn’t get the chance to explore myself or my desires before settling down.
* I’ve grown into a stronger, more self-aware version of myself, and I know what I want now.
* I feel like I’ve outgrown the dynamic and the role I had in this relationship.
* If I had a coffee date with a 23 year old me, I’d tell her to pass on this relationship and wait until she was more secure, more experienced, not desperate to feel loved, and able to not set herself on fire to keep her partner warm.  

**5. Desire for independence**

* I constantly fantasize about living alone, having my own routines, my own space, and not managing/taking care of someone else.
* The idea of being on my own feels freeing, not scary.
* I want a partnership that supports my growth instead of making me feel stuck, if I want another partner at all.  

**6. Guilt and fear of hurting him**

* He is a genuinely good person beneath his/our issues, and I don’t want to hurt him.
* A big part of why I stay is fear:
   * He’s not doing well mentally. He’s very depressed.
   * I’m afraid he might harm himself if I leave.
   * I worry about breaking his trust in people even more.
   * I still remember how devastated he was when I tried leaving before.
* I don’t want to sacrifice my happiness or growth out of fear, but that fear is very real.  

**7. External attraction highlighting internal issues**

* Recently, I’ve felt an intense attraction to someone else.
* This attraction is NOT the root problem, but it has shown me how long it’s been since I felt that way.
* It highlighted how numb and disconnected I’ve become in my marriage. This attraction makes me feel like I’m on fire, and in a way that I don’t EVER remember feeling before.
* I’m not stupid, so I don’t have any silly notions of “throwing away my marriage over a crush” or something.  

**8. What I truly want**

* I want a relationship built on connection, desire, shared effort, affection, and emotional/physical support… or to simply be free and single.
* When I imagine staying, I feel resigned, like I have no choice and must keep going down a path I don’t want.
* When I imagine leaving (focusing on only myself, not the fallout) I feel a mix of relief and guilt.
* If guilt and consequences disappeared, and I followed only my feelings, I would want a clean break and a fresh start.

I want a life that fits the woman I’ve become, not the insecure girl I was when I met him. 

Additional context: We live with my parents. I pay rent, he does not. I have a job, he does not. We live about 6 hours away from his family/where we're originally from. His car is not functional enough and has expired tags. He would be the one that would have to leave, as this house belongs to my family and there is no way that I would quit the job I love or could currently afford to move.

How do I find the strength to leave and what is the logical first step?

TL;DR: I married my first serious partner. I’m now in my 30s, growing into myself, and realizing I’ve felt emotionally and physically checked out for years. I carry most of the mental load, don’t feel supported, don’t feel desired or connected, and don’t want sex with him. His insecurity, jealousy, and lack of effort have widened the gap. I’m craving independence and a life that fits who I am now, not who I was. I feel guilty because he’s struggling, but staying out of fear of hurting him/having conflict is draining me. I want advice on how to find the strength to leave and what steps to take first.",0,1764482746.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

**Memory Transcription Subject:** Izra, Sleepy Arxur

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\]:** February 3, 2137

I had swore I was never going to get used to the circadian rhythm of this world. Everything in me felt like I should be awake when it was dark out, not with scales damned sun beating down on me. Yet, if I was being honest, I felt like I had adapted quite well. That was until this morning.  
  
I’d woken up extra early to say goodbye to my housemates and walk them to the transport that would be awaiting them outside the camp. I let out a yawn as I attempted to rub some of the sleep from my tired eyes, before making my way downstairs. The others were already up, double checking their bags before they left. Thankfully the only light came from the dim glow of the early dawn slipping in through the windows.   
  
“Holopad. Check. Charger. Check…” Arthur confirmed aloud, looking up from his bag as I reached the bottom of the stairs. “Hey! Coming to see us off?” He asked, flashing his teeth at me.   
  
“Yes.” I replied, looking up at the small clock that hung on the wall of the dining room. I took a moment, trying to read what it said. Arthur had tried teaching me how to understand it, but it was still difficult.  
  
“What time is it?” I asked at last, giving up on trying to recall the proper method of deciphering the device. I was too tired to care.  
  
“About 6am.” Arthur answered, peering into the kitchen at the clock, “Nalva sent a message just a minute ago. The shuttle’s already in orbit so it should be landing within the next hour or so.  
  
“I hope this one has windows.” Jammek bleated excitedly, “I’d love to be able to see Skalga from orbit. I’ve always dreamed of that.”  
  
“Why we gotta go so eawly?” Mixsel yawned, the tiny Sivkit sitting on the couch as the two adults checked their bags. She looked like she was ready to fall back asleep at any second. I made my way over and picked her up.  
  
“Because you are going on an adventure.” I cooed, gently scratching her tummy with my free claw.  
  
“Why awen’t you coming Izwa?” She asked, letting out another lengthy yawn as she fought to keep her eyes open. I could see Arthur and Jammek exchange looks, a sad expression flashing across their features at that question.  
  
“We wish she could come too Munchkin.” Arthur sighed, “But the folks on Skalga are…”  
  
“They’re very easily frightened.” I finished for him, brushing a bit of fluff out of her eyes, “And Arxur are very big. I might scare them to death. So just remember that and try not to scare them too, okay?”  
  
“I’ll twy…” She answered, those eyelids finally growing too heavy and closing. I let out a deep, affectionate bellow at the sight of the cute little fluffball.  
  
“I hope you know I meant that.” Arthur said, his voice barely above a whisper, “I really do wish you could come too.”  
  
“I’ll be fine Arthur.” I huffed, “To be entirely honest I would like the alone time. Plus, I would rather not have to skulk around a planet of people who are going to see me as a cannibalistic monster.”  
  
“The universe isn’t a very fair place is it?” Jammek sighed, closing his bag and sliding it onto his shoulder. Arthur’s shoulders slumped a bit, zipping up his own bag.  
  
“It sure isn’t.” The human agreed, looking back up at me, holding the now sleeping youngling. He didn’t say anything else but simply gave a weak, close-lipped smile at me.  
  
“Don’t worry, Munchkin.” He continued finally, picking up his duffelbag and tossing it over his shoulder, “We’ll call Auntie Izra every day.” He gave me a playful wink.  
  
“Auntie?” I repeated inquiringly.  
  
“What?” He chuckled, moving towards the front door as the sound of a car horn honking came from outside, “Does that word not translate?”  
  
“No it translates.” I answered, following after him, “But I am not related to her parents in any way. It is biologically impossible for me to be her aunt.” Before I stepped out the door I grabbed my goggles from the peg beside the entryway. The sun had yet to peak over the horizon, but the streaks of orange, gold and purple that painted the sky to the east let me know it wasn’t far off, and I didn’t want to make my way back home half blind.  
  
I could see a large, blocky, black vehicle waiting for us in the road, the front lights shining on the pavement ahead of it. I heard Jammek shut the door behind us as our group walked towards the car.  
  
“Well,” Arthur retorted, “where I’m from that isn’t the only thing an auntie is. It was a term we’d use to say that we loved someone \*\*like\*\* they were family. Even if they weren’t actually related to us.” I took a moment to take that in. Humans truly were a bizarre race. So little of what they said or did made sense, and it honestly worried me how used to that fact I had gotten. At this point, I’d learned to just take whatever crazy thing came out of Arthur’s mouth and just run with it.  
  
“So you’re saying I am like family to her then?” I asked, my tail wagging a bit at the thought.  
  
“Hell! Izra,” The human laughed, opening the door and gesturing for me to hop in first, “Of course you are.” As I stepped up into the vehicle he gave me a pat on the shoulder, “If you want you can be an honorary Coldwater too!”  
  
I answered him with a snort, laughing a bit at the goofy primate before taking my seat. Mixsel, now asleep in my arms, stirred slightly and let out a soft whine. 

I quickly spotted Eva sitting in the driver’s seat up front although, from how she was positioned, I imagined the vehicle was probably driving itself. She turned around as we entered, giving me a wave.

“Decided to see these goofballs off too, Izra?” She asked. I imitated the head nodding gesture I’d seen humans do, “By the way, I have something I need to talk to you about later.” I cocked my head in curiosity at that, but the uniformed woman didn’t bother to elaborate further. Instead she looked to my left as Jammek climbed in beside me.  
  
“Morning Jammek.” She greeted, the Venlil giving her a waggle of his ears in reply. Finally Arthur climbed into the front passenger seat.  
  
“Let’s get this show on the road.” He said excitedly, “I can’t wait to get into space!”  
  
“Why?” Eva laughed as the car lurched forward and began to autonomously roll its way towards the landing area outside of the camp.  
  
“Well I want to see what it’s like, ya know?”  
  
“Arthur, you've **been** to space already.” She laughed, “How do you think you got back to Earth from the Archives?”  
  
“I mean… yeah.” The human admitted sheepishly, “But I wasn’t able to appreciate it then. This time I can!”  
  
“Fair enough.” She replied, relaxing into her seat, “Can’t say I’m not a little jealous of you two getting a whole vacation on the Venlil’s dime.”  
  
“Speaking of Venlil,” Jammek piped up, “Where’s Nalva?”  
  
“Already at the landing zone.” Eva explained, “That woman’s been going a mile a minute all morning. Making calls, checking schedules, etcetera.”  
  
The remainder of the ride to the landing zone was relatively short and, within a few minutes, I could see the flat, paved area where we had gotten on our transport just a few days prior. The sky above had brightened considerably by now, and the sun would be cresting over the top of the pine forest to the east soon. I gently shifted Mixsel out of my arms and hurriedly slid my goggles on.  
  
The vehicle came to a stop right at the end of the landing area. I could see the small, gray Venlil out on the landing zone, busily typing away on a holopad and seemingly oblivious to our approach. Arthur was the first to move, grabbing hold of the door and throwing it open before leaping out with his bag. The rest of us did the same, although, not nearly with the enthusiasm he had.  
  
The brisk chill of the air had already begun to warm as the sun steadily climbed its way up into the sky. In the distance I could already make out the soft roar of thrusters. I turned my eyes to the sky, searching for the transport, but it was still too far off to see. The noise seemed to be enough to rouse the tiny Sivkit I had been carrying though, and she suddenly stirred in my arms, squirming for a moment before opening her eyes.  
  
“Awe we in space yet?” She asked with a yawn, making me bellow out a laugh as I sat her down on the concrete below. To my right I heard Arthur begin to hum out a melody as we made our way around the vehicle towards the landing pad. I turned my head towards him, listening as he switched from merely humming to belting out a song.  
  
**\*\*All my bags are packed\*\***  
  
**\*\*Ready to go\*\***  
  
**\*\*I’m standin’ here outside your door\*\***  
  
**\*\*I hate to wake you up to say goodbye\*\***  
  
**\*\*But the dawn is breakin’\*\***  
  
**\*\*It’s early morn\*\***  
  
**\*\*The taxi’s waitin’\*\***  
  
**\*\*He’s blowing’ his horn\*\***  
  
**\*\*Already i’m so lonesome\*\***  
  
**\*\*I could die.\*\***  
  
Suddenly Eva seemed to catch on to whatever song it was that Arthur was singing and began to join in, smiling as she added her own voice to Arthur’s.  
  
**\*\*So kiss me and smile for me\*\***  
  
**\*\*Tell me that you’ll wait for me\*\***  
  
**\*\*Hold me like you’ll never let me go\*\***  
  
My human friend began to dance as he sang, picking up a giggling Mixsel and swinging her about in his arms. I could see Jammek whistling out a laugh as well, watching Arthur make a fool of himself.  
  
**\*\*Cause I’m leaving on a jet plane!\*\***  
  
**\*\*Don’t know when i’ll be back again\*\***  
  
**\*\*Oh babe, I hate to go!\*\***  
  
Eva had joined her voice to Arthur’s, although she didn’t bother dancing like he did. Arthur did a spin, clutching Mixsel tight as he twirled. Even I had to give an amused chuckle at the primate’s antics.  
  
Finally the shuttle came into view above us, slowing to a halt in the air, before beginning its slow descent. It was certainly different than the ones we had ridden in previously and, if the design was anything to go off of, I had to assume it was of Venlil design and not human. Instead of the blocky, narrow vehicle we had ridden to Arthur’s homeland, this one was quite round, with the main body of the craft almost a half circle. To either side of the bulbous middle were two, large, fat wings, with engines situated in the front and rear. The front of the vessel came to a point that reminded me of an avian’s beak.  
  
“Oh shit there’s windows on the sides!” Arthur exclaimed excitedly, “Looks like we’ll have a view!”  
  
“That’s one of Governor Tarva’s personal transports!” Nalva bleated excitedly as she looked up from her holopad. Suddenly her eyes locked onto me and I could see her freeze up, her whole body starting to tremble. I sighed in frustration. I could understand her fear, knowing what my people had done to hers, yet it didn’t make the fear hurt any less. The Venlil slowly scooted her way to the other side of our group, putting the others between me and herself. “T… that… m… means we will be tra… tra… traveling in luxury.” She managed to stammer, despite her terror.  
  
Jammek appeared to be about to say something to her when a second vehicle approached and parked beside the one we had come in. The front passenger door opened and a single figure emerged. A white-wooled Skalgan carrying a beige travel bag. Brim. I had never met him, but from what Arthur and Jammek had told me he didn’t sound like the pleasant sort. He walked up to our group and stood there, silent and purposefully avoiding speaking to anyone.  
  
Finally the shuttle completed its descent and, with a loud thud, sat down on the pavement. A moment later, a ramp lowered from the rear of the ship and a set of doors opened at the top. I could see a small, blonde colored Venlil in the entrance. They slowly made their way down the ramp, pausing only once they saw me. I could smell the sheer terror emanating off of them and, for a moment, I genuinely thought they might faint. Instead they simply froze, their yellow eyes locked straight onto me. Thankfully Arthur, Jammek and Nalva stepped between us.  
  
“She’s not a threat.” Nalva quickly assured him, “I know what it looks like. But I promise, you’re safe.”  
  
“The… the humans have… A… Arxur here?” He gasped.  
  
“I promise they aren’t anything like the Arxur you know.” Jammek insisted. I had already seen enough. I turned and headed back towards the vehicle we had arrived in. No point in terrifying the mammals any further. I opened the front passenger door and prepared to step inside when I felt a touch on my side. I turned to find Arthur standing there. Before I could ask him what he wanted, he lunged in, wrapping his arms around me.  
  
“Don’t burn the place down while we’re gone.” He teased, squeezing me tight. I froze for a moment before gently placing a claw on his back.  
  
“No promises.” I replied, letting out a laugh.  
  
“I’m gonna miss you Gojira.” He chuckled back. The last word didn’t translate, so I was forced to assume it was either a title or one of Arthur’s indecipherable references.  
  
“Enjoy your trip, friend Arthur.” I replied, as he at last relinquished his grip on me and turned back towards his transport. I climbed into the seat, scrunching up to fit. The front seats seemed to lack a lot of the leg room that the rear ones possessed.  
  
I watched through the tinted window as Eva gave Arthur a hug before  turning back to the vehicle I was in. My eyes followed the woman as she made her way around the front of it and then climbed into the driver’s seat.  
  
“I hope those two can keep out of trouble.” She laughed as she turned our ride back on and the metal box began to move.   
  
“So what was it you wanted to talk about earlier?” I pressed as our ride pulled back onto the main road. I watched as my friends lugged their bags up the ramp of the ship, before the vehicle turned and they vanished from sight.  
  
“Oh, that!” She exclaimed, her flat face lighting up with excitement, “So, since Shuyi is back, I was going to gather up a few of the ladies and have a girl’s night!”  
  
“What exactly is a… girl’s night?” I inquired, cocking my head at her curiously.  
  
“It’s a night where you gather up your female friends and we drink and gossip!” Eva explained, her smile growing even wider, “I even found a liquor you can drink, without getting sick!” She explained, “It will be great! I know it’ll make her feel better. Maybe you could even invite that Veryn girl?”  
  
“I can try,” I replied, trying to take in what the excited primate was saying, “She’s Krov’na and I worry I’ll burn her out on socializing.”  
  
“Really?” She asked, turning towards me disappointedly, “I think that it would do her some good. Her housemate, Hilvia, says she spends most of her time holed up in her room. I can’t imagine that’s good for anyone. I think finding some friends would be good for the poor girl, even if she isn’t the socializing type.  
  
“I have to agree there.” I sighed, letting out a soft growl. I’d been trying for days now to drag Veryn out of her room. She blamed her lack of desire to socialize for her refusal, but I suspected it was more than that. Betterment still had their claws in that poor girl’s mind. She second guessed everything and reacted like every movement was a blow about to land on her. If I hadn’t despised those psychopaths already, I certainly would have now.  
  
“So Frank agreed to get Onio and Iskit out of the house for us. He’s gathering up a few of the guys in the camp and teaching them to play poker, so us gals will have the whole place to ourselves!” She explained, “I just think it would be nice to show Shuyi that she has people to rely on.”  
  
“It sounds like a fine idea.” I concurred as our vehicle pulled up next to my own house and came to a stop. I opened my door, stepping out before looking back, “Just message me on the holopad when you want me to walk over.”  
  
“Sounds good Izra!” She answered with a wave, “I’ll see you tonight!” With that I shut the door and the vehicle drove off. I turned myself back towards the door, walking up and sliding my keycard up to the scanner and unlocking it. A moment later I was inside and hanging up my goggles.  
  
For a moment I considered going back to bed and getting a couple more hours of sleep. Then my stomach let out a growl. Perhaps a bit of food was in order before I lay down. I made my way into the kitchen and opened the pantry door, reaching in and grabbing a small paper carton labeled “Beef Broth”. Arthur had suggested I try it after I had tried his coffee drink and gotten sick. I poured a cup’s worth into a pot and then turned the stove burner on.  
  
With that cooking I moved over to the refrigerator and checked inside to see if we had any meat thawed. When I opened the door I was greeted by a large, covered container I didn’t recognize. I spotted a small, folded-up piece of paper atop it and pulled that out first, unfolding it to reveal a page of human writing. I peered at it a moment, doing my best to decipher the writing without a translator app. If I planned to be on this planet in the long term, I was going to have to learn the language eventually.  
  
“Hey… Izra…” I read aloud, going slow as I struggled to decipher the straight, angular writing. “I saw how much you… liked… this…” I let out a sigh, grabbing my holopad and loading the translator app.  
  
“I saw how much you liked this andouille when we were in Baton Rouge so I told Eva to grab you some! Think of me when you eat it because, from what they told me, I won’t be able to get a drop of meat until I get back to Earth! Looks like it’s gonna be nothing but rabbit food for yours truly. See you soon! Love, Arthur.”  
  
I sat the note aside on the kitchen counter, pulling out the covered container and setting it down as well. I pulled the top off the container, revealing a mountainous pile of the delicious, spiced sausages that I’d sampled in Arthur’s homeland. I grabbed one and popped it into my mouth before moving back to the stove. I silently thanked Arthur for his thoughtful gift as I took the broth off the stove top and poured the heated concoction into a mug.  
  
I turned the burner off and moved back over to the table with my mug of broth. Taking a seat I sampled some of the sausage before taking a slow sip of my drink. As I ate my meal I pulled up my holopad and looked up the song Arthur had been singing, if only to hear how it actually sounded. There were several renditions of it but I finally selected one to listen to. It certainly sounded better than Arthur’s off key rendition.  
  
I closed my eyes, listening to the music as I popped a couple more pieces of the thinly sliced meat into my maw. It was then that something occurred to me. The house was deathly silent. No Arthur or Jammek laughing. No Mixsel squealing and running about. More than that, the house simply \*\*smelt\*\* fresher. No raging mammalian hormones in the air.  
  
I took a moment to drink in the peace of it all as I took another sip. I could have never imagined in all my life that I would like being alone. I was a Drov’na. I had spent my life as the most socially minded person in any given room. I had always felt starved for companionship. Yet here? With these highly social furballs? It had honestly gotten to the point that even I needed a break. I let out a sad laugh. I suppose I understood how my sweet Isif had felt now, having to deal with me constantly pestering him to talk.  
  
I quickly steered my thoughts away from that direction though. As nice as reminiscing on the past may be, I knew it wouldn’t do many any good to do so right now. If anything it would only make me sad.  
  
Instead I turned off the music on my holopad and looked up “girl’s night” on the Terran internet. The pad quickly spat out a simplified definition for me:  
  
**A ""girls night"" is a social gathering exclusively for women, which can be a casual get-together at home or an outing to a venue. Ideas for a girls night include having a spa night, cooking a meal, playing games, watching movies, or going out for a creative workshop, comedy show, or karaoke**  
  
Interesting enough of a concept. Such a thing wasn’t familiar to me but I was certainly intrigued. I opened up the messaging app next, finding Veryn’s contact info.  
  
**“I request for you to join me tonight for an interesting Human ritual known as girl’s night.”**  
  
I sat the tablet down, not expecting an immediate response. It was uncertain whether the girl would even be awake yet. She had seemingly struggled a good deal more than myself with adjusting to this planet’s activity schedule. To my surprise I heard a quick \*PING\* come from my pad a second later.  
  
**“Would that be ok? I don’t wish to invade the human’s privacy.”**  
  
I quickly picked the tablet back up and typed in a response.  
  
**“Absolutely. They requested I invite you""**  
  
**“Really? I don’t know. I don’t want to be a bother.”**  
  
**""I insist. It would do you well to make more friends. I will message you later and let you know when to meet me.”**  
  
**“Thanks Izra. I look forward to this girl’s night ritual.”**

**Transcript Time Skip Requested. Advancing Memory by 11** 

I had spent most of the day surfing through the news. I’d hoped for some scrap of information about the state of the Arxur rebellion but it seemed the news was still mostly focused on the stunning revelations from the Farsul’s Archives. I did manage to glean a few interesting tidbits off the web though. Rumors had circulated about elevated attacks on the Dominion by the rebellion, including a bombing of the Prophet-Descendant’s own manor! It was enough to make my tail lash with joy.  
  
\*PING\*  
  
A message arrived on my holopad from Eva. I closed out the news site I had been pursuing and opened it up.  
  
**“Hey! I just got of duty. About to head to Shuyi’s house. Grab Veryn and head that way.”**  
  
I closed that message, quickly switching to Veryn’s contact and informing her to go ahead and meet me at my house. Closing down the messenger app I climbed to my feet, off the couch, attaching the pad to the belt on my waist before going to the front door. I went ahead and stood outside to wait for the young Arxur.  
  
The weather was brisk and the wind was enough to send a chill down my spine, but it was still a good deal warmer than it had been the last clawful of days. The sky was steadily darkening and the first handful of stars were starting to shimmer in the sky above. A few lines of orange and purple in the far distance was all that was left of the local star’s light. That suited me just fine. I’d rather not have to wear my goggles if I didn’t have to. 

I could already see Veryn heading down the road in my direction. The poor girl still hadn’t gotten over her nerves it seemed; I could see her constantly craning her head this way and that, as though she feared an unexpected blow might rain down on her at any moment.

“Hello Veryn.” I greeted her, putting a claw on her shoulder in an attempt to calm her nerves. The girl curled in on herself slightly at my touch before finally relaxing.

“Hello Izra.” She replied sheepishly, “You’re certain that it’s ok if I…”  
  
“I have already stated it is.” I huffed, starting to walk towards my neighbor’s house, “Leave that second guessing nonsense to the mammals.” That was enough to get a chuckle out of the girl and she hurried forward so she could walk beside me. A second later and I was rapping my claw on the door.  
  
“Izra! Veryn!” Shuyi cheered as the door opened, the woman stepping to the side and gesturing for us to come in. Her face already looked much better than the last time I had seen her. We stepped inside and I could see there were already a few other people there. I could see Triski the Tilfish and Islatta sitting on the couch, as well as Veryn’s own housemate, the Takken named Hilvia. We walked over, joining them on the sectional.  
  
“Glad you ladies could make it.”   
  
I tilted my head, finding Eva walking in from the other room with several, small, rounded glasses and placing them down on the coffee table, in the middle of the room.  
  
“The concept of a girls night intrigued me.” I admitted.  
  
“Doesn’t it sound like a delightful little ritual?” Hilvia squealed excitedly, “Leave it to the hyper-social primates to come up with something like that!” Eva hurried out of the room once more, coming back with 5 large bottles bundled in her arms, as well as two cartons which contained six smaller bottles in each.

She placed the bottles down on the table as well, right as Shuyo came into the room, carrying a large platter covered in various snacks.

“Let’s get this party started, gals!” She laughed while placing the platter down. Eva had produced a small tool from her pocket, that seemed to be little more than a metal spiral attached to a plastic handle. She drove the metal spiral into the stopper atop one of the bottles, using it to pry the barrier loose.

“I grabbed some wine from the supply cache for those of us that can consume plants and I got something special for our obligate carnivores!” Eva announced, as she began to pour the purple liquid from the large bottle out into the smaller glasses.

“What is it?” Triski asked, grabbing one of the glasses and waving an antenna over it.

“Fermented fruit juice.” Shuyi answered, grabbing one of the glasses for herself and taking a sip. Eva reached down to the small cartons holding the other bottles, pulling up a couple of them and handing one to Veryn and I.

“It’s called Kumis.” Eva explained, “It’s made from fermented mare’s milk. I know a guy in Florida who says the Arxur there love these.”

“There’s Arxur in Florida?” Shuyi inquired in shock.

“Oh yeah!” Eva explained with a laugh, “We’ve had a ton of Arxur defect from Betterment over the last few weeks. The governor of Florida is practically begging them to move there!” Shuyi giggled maniacally at that, though whatever the joke was, it went over my head.

I took a claw and gently pried the metal cap from the bottle she had handed me. I brought it up to my snout and gave it a sniff. It smelled… sour. I pulled it away from my nostrils and gave Eva a skeptical look.

“Trust me.” She said with a wink, “Just give it a taste.”

I slowly brought the bottle to my mouth and took a sip. The liquid was thicker than I expected but, despite the unusual smell, the taste was salty and refreshing with just a slight burning sensation. I let out a satisfied hiss.

Veryn, beside me, seemed to notice my reaction and took a heavy gulp of her own bottle. Her reaction was no less pleased than my own.

“Whoa!” Eva laughed, “Go easy on that Veryn! Arxur don’t exactly have a high alcohol tolerance!”

“Alcohol?” I growled disapprovingly, “The substance that rot fang Walter was drinking?”

“He was an alcoholic.” Shuyi spat, “That bastard would have sold his own mother for a drink. Just don’t drink too much of it and you’ll be fine.”

I slowly took another sip, savoring the salty drink, as did Veryn. I’d have to be sure to drink the strange fluid slowly and monitor its effects. I certainly didn’t want to end up like the scoundrel that had hurt poor Shuyi.

“Now how about we turn on some music?” Eva suggested, pulling out her holopad and connecting it to the holoprojector, “You’ve got a lot of music to catch up on Shuyi, and there’s no better place to start than a girl’s night classic… the Backstreet Boys!” 

A second later and the holoprojector came to life, displaying footage from what appeared to be a concert event. I could see what appeared to be thousands of humans filling a stadium as a group of male primates walked out onto the stage.

The sheer scale of it blew me away, even before the music began. I could never have imagined playing to a crowd of Arxur that size. There was no way we could have ever put that many Arxur in an enclosed space together! I had been a fairly popular performer in my time and the largest crowd I had ever performed for had numbered in the dozens.

Finally the music started and the crowd of humans on the projector let out a roar of excitement.

**“Show me the meaning of being lonely.”**

The quintet of humans on stage began to sing. I listened intently, finding the music decent enough. Not particularly my preferred style, but it was interesting enough at least. I chanced a look over at Veryn, only to find her eyes glued to the projection, her tail wagging excitedly behind her. It seemed she was quite enamored with it….

**\*\*Transcription Time Skip Requested. Advancing Memory by 2 Hours.\*\***

“He’s such a sweet boy!” Islatta whined, the Krokotl swaying back and forth as she tried not to cry. The glass of wine in her hand was sloshing dangerously back and forth, threatening to spill over onto the couch at any moment.

“And you’re a good… \*HIC\* Momma bird!” Shuyi assured her, throwing an arm around the unsteady avian. The Krokotl sniffled slightly, wiping one eye with her free wing.

“They’re so good!” Veryn giggled, looking through pictures of these, “Backstreet Boys” on her holopad as Eva giggled beside her. Whatever this “alcohol” substance was, it has certainly helped Veryn with her earlier nervousness. Now she was absolutely gushing over these human musicians from over a century ago.

“So as I was saying,” Hilvia continued in a slurred voice, snapping my attention back to the Takken, “I… uhh… I was just sooooo glad to get… \*HIC\* Walter out of the house. He was… was a menace!” I gave an agreeing wave of my tail. Why had it become so hard to concentrate? Was that what alcohol did? It also seemed to put me in a rather good mood, which made it all the more baffling to me why that bastard Walter had been so angry while consuming it.

Before I could formulate a response I heard the holopad on my belt go off. I reached down, clumsily undoing the strap that held it in place and brought it up to my lap. The words on it seemed to shift and blur, making it difficult to make out. After a moment though I was able to decipher that it was an incoming call from Arthur. I reached one claw down towards the screen, carefully pressing the “answer” button.

To my surprise it wasn’t Arthur on the other end, but Mixsel instead.

“Hi auntie Izwa!” She giggled, looking down at the holopad on her end, having seemingly propped it up on a table or other surface. The little Sivkit’s paws were busy holding her precious Frank on one side, and some sort of colorful candy on a stick in the other.

“Awww!” Triski cooed from where she had been laying on the floor, “She calls you auntie? That’s soooooo sweet!”

“When did… when did that start?” An equally inebriated Eva asked, grinning from ear to ear.

“Hello… little one.” I answered, ignoring the other’s comments, “How is your trip going?” I was suddenly finding it difficult to keep my voice from slurring as well.

“It’s weally hot on Skalga.” She replied, giving the colorful treat a lick, “Evewything feels heavy too. Oh! And Awfu and Jammy got in a fight on the way!”

“Oh no!” Islatta squawked, her eyes lighting up at the possibility of gossip, “A lover’s quarrel so soon?”

“That’s… \*HIC\* terrible!” Veryn agreed, leaning over my shoulder to look at the holopad on my lap, “What were they… were they arguing about?”

“I don’t know.” Mixsel replied innocently, her head tilting a bit to look at Veryn, “But the nice Venlil man said that they got they tails kicked!” She let out a giggle at that. It took a moment for my addled mind to catch up with what she was saying. Eva, however, seemed to catch on immediately.

1 feat- at the age of 3-4, she realized that Hibiki was jealous of her because she was superior to Hibiki in almost everything 
Feat 2- as soon as Hibiki broke down psychologically because Kanade killed the dog, Kanade realized that she ""needed"" to kill everyone around Hibiki, and that in this way she would bring Hibiki to a state of complete submission 
Feat 3- Controlled Hibiki's life and killed over 60+ people, planned their deaths by outsmarting the future best high school cop, it requires a lot of foreisght and planning
Feat 4- she planned a plan to kill Setsuki, apparently in less than 8 hours (I've seen it somewhere)
Feat 5- She took everything she needed to kill: sleeping pills, blood bags, a first-aid kit.
Feat 6- She knew Iroha's schedule and that she was drinking coffee, and she drugged Iroha so she wouldn't go to the meeting and became a suspect
Feat 7- She used Setsuki's handbook to confuse incoming and outgoing traffic at the gate
Feat 8- she purposely did not kill Setsuki, and used blood bags to pour over the body of the electrocuted Setsuki, luring Hibiki into this trap so that she would fall into her traumatized state
Feat 9- she took two knives, and simultaneously stabbed Setsuki in the STOMACH with Hibiki, so that there would be two culprits, in fact, Setsuki would still have died from being stabbed in the stomach by two people, this would be considered as a completely joint murder, for example, if they had both stabbed Setsuki in the chest, the one who would have hit was considered She would have been blackened because Setsuki would have died from a stab in the heart. The students couldn't vote for one, because that=death 
Feat 10- she deliberately dismembered Setsuki's body, and apparently hid the torso so that the participants could not find out that two people had done the stabbing, or so that they would not have thought of it, because if that were the case, the participants could somehow intuitively understand that there were two killers because of the old wounds inflicted at different times at the same time the sides of the stomach, and this would be an issue that would delay the trial and it would be one of the main issues for the trial to end on a timer (if there is a timer)
11 feat- she used a transfer robot to move the breast to the other side.
Feat 12- Kanade disguised Hibiki as herself using Setsuki's hand, she also used Setsuki's hands to open her directory.
Feat 13- She texted Iroha about meeting at 6 p.m. at the ghost house so Iroha could see her (and thought it was probably Hibiki), but it was probably a trap too, and she put out the fire to turn off the power 
14 feat- she used the monorail to drop 7 parts of Setsuki's body in the altar while Hibiki was in the role of Kanade along with the others, creating a dissonance of ""how is that?""
Feat 15- She poured blood inside the ghost house, creating the appearance of murder there.
16 feat- she deliberately behaved suspiciously like an arrogant jerk during the trial so that she would be suspected in court and voted for, which would be a mistake",1,1764482455.0,IntelligenceScaling,0,0.99,False
1paautp,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1paautp/best_vpns_for_turkey/,Best VPNs for Turkey,"Turkey's internet landscape has become increasingly restrictive, with almost 220,000 URLs blocked as of December 2023. If you're in Turkey or planning to visit, you've likely encountered frustrating blocks on social media platforms, news sites, and messaging apps. The situation escalated dramatically in March 2025, when authorities imposed widespread limitations on social media platforms during anti-government protests.

The good news? A reliable VPN can help you bypass these restrictions and access the open internet. However, finding a VPN that actually works in Turkey is challenging—27 popular VPN services were banned in December 2023, including household names like NordVPN and Surfshark (at least officially).

This guide reveals which VPNs still work reliably in Turkey based on recent testing, what features you absolutely need, and how to use them safely and legally.

# Quick Comparison: Top VPNs for Turkey

|VPN|Obfuscation|Speed|Turkey Servers|Price|Best For|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**ExpressVPN**|Automatic|Fastest overall|Yes|$6.67/mo|Reliability & ease of use|
|**NordVPN**|Dedicated servers|385.67 Mbps|Yes|$3.69/mo|Advanced features|
|**Surfshark**|NoBorders mode|800+ Mbps|Yes|$2.19/mo|Budget & unlimited devices|

# Why You Need a VPN in Turkey (2025 Update)

# Current Censorship Landscape

Turkey's approach to internet freedom has grown increasingly restrictive. The country is classified as ""Not Free"" by Freedom House, with a score of just 31 points out of 100, reflecting severe limitations on digital rights.

Common blocks you'll encounter:

* **Social media platforms**: Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok (intermittent blocks)
* **Messaging apps**: Discord, WhatsApp (during political unrest)
* **News sites**: Independent journalism and international news outlets
* **Other content**: Wikipedia (previously blocked for years), LGBTQ+ content, gambling sites, adult content

As recently as October 2024, Discord was suddenly blocked by Turkish authorities, and during March 2025 social media blackouts, Proton VPN recorded a spike of +1,100% in usage as citizens sought to stay connected.

# How Turkey Blocks VPNs

The Turkish government doesn't just block websites—ISPs block VPNs on behalf of the government, making it hard to get a subscription or connect to VPN servers. They employ two primary methods:

1. **Website blocking**: Preventing access to VPN provider websites
2. **Traffic detection**: Using deep packet inspection to identify and block VPN protocols

This is why you need a VPN with advanced obfuscation technology that disguises your VPN traffic as regular internet activity.

# Essential Features for Turkey VPNs

Not all VPNs will work in Turkey. Here's what you absolutely need:

# 1. Obfuscation Technology

This is non-negotiable. Obfuscation disguises your VPN traffic as regular internet traffic, so neither your Turkish ISP nor the government can tell you're using a VPN. Look for features like:

* Stealth protocols
* Obfuscated servers
* Shadowsocks support
* Traffic camouflage

# 2. Strong Encryption

AES-256 encryption and ChaCha20 are the ideal choices for protecting your data from surveillance.

# 3. Verified No-Logs Policy

Choose VPNs with independently audited no-logs policies. If Turkish authorities demand user data, there should be nothing to hand over.

# 4. Kill Switch

A kill switch cuts off your internet when your VPN disconnects unexpectedly, preventing accidental exposure of your real IP address.

# 5. Fast Speeds

Obfuscation typically slows your connection, so start with a fast VPN. NordVPN averaged 385.67 Mbps in tests, making it the fastest VPN provider on this list.

# Top 5 VPNs for Turkey: Detailed Reviews

# 1. ExpressVPN – Best Overall for Turkey

**Why it works**: ExpressVPN's obfuscation is automatically enabled on its Automatic protocol setting and is available on all servers, meaning you don't have to fiddle with settings to stay protected.

**Key Features**:

* Automatic obfuscation across entire network
* Proprietary Lightway protocol for speed
* Servers in 105 countries including Turkey
* Fastest VPN on the market, with websites and videos loading instantly
* 30-day money-back guarantee

**Performance**: In tests on both local and nearby servers, there wasn't any buffering when streaming HD and 4K videos.

**Best for**: First-time VPN users and anyone who needs reliability without technical complexity. ExpressVPN stood out as one of the few providers that reliably bypassed Internet censorship in Turkey as well as China and Saudi Arabia.

**Pricing**: Starting at $6.67/month (annual plan with extra months free)

# 2. NordVPN – Best for Advanced Features

**Why it works**: This VPN has multiple ways to beat strict digital censorship, though its obfuscated servers are quite a bit slower than the general-purpose ones.

**Key Features**:

* Dedicated obfuscated servers
* Double VPN and Onion over VPN for extra security
* 5,300+ servers in 60+ countries
* Fastest VPN provider on this list, averaging 385.67 Mbps
* Threat Protection Pro blocks ads and malware
* Up to 10 simultaneous connections

**Performance**: When tested in Turkey, it instantly unlocked blocked websites and services.

**Best for**: Privacy-conscious users who want maximum security features and fast speeds for streaming and downloading.

**Pricing**: Starting at $3.69/month (24-month plan)

# 3. Surfshark – Best Budget Option

**Why it works**: Surfshark's NoBorders mode helps maintain internet access in high-censorship regions. During the March 2025 social media blackout, many users relied on NoBorders to access platforms like Facebook and Instagram.

**Key Features**:

* NoBorders mode automatically activates in restrictive countries
* Camouflage mode for obfuscation
* Unlimited simultaneous device connections
* Speeds over 800 Mbps in US server tests, outpacing both ExpressVPN and NordVPN
* Servers in 100+ countries including Turkey
* Independently audited no-logs policy by Deloitte

**Performance**: Connecting 8 devices simultaneously to Surfshark's Istanbul server showed minimal impact on performance.

**Best for**: Families and users with multiple devices who want excellent value without sacrificing quality.

**Pricing**: Starting at $2.19/month (24-month plan)

# 4. Private Internet Access (PIA) – Best for Customization

**Why it works**: PIA's obfuscation via Shadowsocks routes traffic through obfuscation-compatible servers, with only an 18% speed drop from baseline.

**Key Features**:

* Shadowsocks and SOCKS5 proxy support
* Highly customizable encryption settings
* Port 443 routing for better speeds on Turkish networks
* 90+ server countries
* MACE feature blocks malicious domains
* Unlimited simultaneous connections

**Performance**: Using AES 128-bit provided the fastest speeds in testing, giving you flexibility to balance speed vs. security.

**Best for**: Advanced users who want granular control over their VPN settings and protocols.

**Pricing**: Starting at $2.19/month (24-month plan)

# 5. Astrill VPN – Most Reliable for Heavy Censorship

**Why it works**: Astrill is the only VPN able to connect in countries with censorship and unblock websites 100% of the time based on nine years of testing.

**Key Features**:

* StealthVPN protocol specifically designed for censorship
* 100% success rate in heavily censored countries
* Servers in 56 countries including Turkey
* Router support for device-wide protection

**Performance**: Consistently works even when other VPNs fail, though at a higher price point.

**Best for**: Users in Turkey long-term who need guaranteed access regardless of government crackdowns.

**Pricing**: Higher cost than competitors, but worth it for reliability

# How to Use a VPN in Turkey: Step-by-Step Guide

# Before You Arrive

1. **Subscribe before entering Turkey**: The Turkish government blocks access to VPN websites, making it difficult to sign up once you're in the country.
2. **Download and install**: Get the VPN app on all your devices before arriving.
3. **Test the connection**: Ensure everything works properly before you need it.

# Setting Up in Turkey

1. **Enable obfuscation**: For most VPNs, you'll need to manually activate stealth features:
   * **ExpressVPN**: Automatically enabled
   * **NordVPN**: Select ""Obfuscated Servers"" from specialty servers
   * **Surfshark**: Enable ""NoBorders"" in settings
   * **PIA**: Enable Shadowsocks and select compatible server
2. **Connect to a server**:
   * For accessing international content: Choose nearby countries (Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus) for best speeds
   * For accessing Turkish content from abroad: Connect to Istanbul server
3. **Verify connection**: Use a leak test site to confirm your IP is masked

# Troubleshooting Tips

If your VPN isn't connecting:

* Switch to a different server location
* Try changing protocols (OpenVPN → WireGuard or vice versa)
* Enable SOCKS proxy, stealth mode, or scramble if available
* Contact 24/7 customer support via live chat (most premium VPNs offer this)
* Clear your browser cache and cookies

# Is Using a VPN Legal in Turkey?

This is a critical question with a nuanced answer.

# The Legal Reality

Yes, it's legal to use a VPN in Turkey. There's no law that explicitly criminalizes the use of VPNs for personal privacy or security. VPN use does not constitute a punishable crime in Turkey. There is no law article directly prohibiting this technology.

However, there are important caveats:

1. **Government blocks access**: While VPNs aren't illegal, many of them are blocked by ISPs through technological means, not legal prohibition.
2. **Purpose matters**: If a VPN is used for illegal activities, that act is penalized. Criminal sanctions are directed at the unlawful act committed, not the VPN.
3. **Online speech is still regulated**: While a VPN will keep your internet activity private, what you say publicly is still subject to Turkish law, which prohibits any denigration of the government.

# The Disinformation Law

In October 2022, Turkey's government passed new legislation known as the ""censorship law"" making ""disseminating false information"" with ""intent to cause anxiety"" a criminal offense, with prison sentences between one and three years.

This law has been used to arrest journalists and critics, regardless of whether they used a VPN.

# Important Disclaimer

**A VPN protects your privacy, not your immunity**. If you break Turkish laws while connected to a VPN, you will be held accountable for those actions. The VPN doesn't grant you immunity from the law.

Our recommendation: Use VPNs for legitimate privacy protection and accessing blocked information, not for activities that violate Turkish law.

# What About Free VPNs?

We strongly advise against free VPNs in Turkey for several reasons:

1. **They don't work**: 23 free VPNs were tested and none offered a Turkish server. Even Windscribe, which previously had one, removed it.
2. **Weak security**: Unlike the best premium VPNs, free VPNs often lack the obfuscation features needed to ensure security in areas of high censorship.
3. **Privacy risks**: Some free VPNs may log your data or sell it to third-party advertisers, leaving you vulnerable to hacking and other cyber threats.
4. **Limited functionality**: Slow speeds, data caps, and inability to access streaming services make them practically useless.

If budget is a concern, opt for affordable premium VPNs like Surfshark or PIA starting at $2.19/month—less than the cost of a coffee.

# Can I Access Streaming Services with a VPN in Turkey?

Yes! All the VPNs recommended here work with major streaming platforms:

* **Netflix**: Access international libraries by connecting to servers in different countries
* **Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video**: Available through US servers
* **Turkish streaming services**: Use Istanbul servers to access BluTV and local content from abroad

You can watch Netflix with a VPN in Turkey, but you'll need a reliable service that works with Netflix libraries across different countries while maintaining fast speeds for HD streaming.

Important note: Using a VPN to access geo-restricted content may violate streaming platforms' terms of service.

# FAQ: VPNs in Turkey

# Which VPN works best in Turkey?

ExpressVPN is the most reliable choice for Turkey, offering automatic obfuscation, consistently fast speeds, and a proven track record of bypassing censorship. For budget-conscious users, Surfshark offers excellent value with its NoBorders feature.

# Can the Turkish government detect VPN usage?

Without proper obfuscation, yes. This is why choosing a VPN with stealth technology is crucial. When properly configured, obfuscation disguises your encrypted traffic as regular internet activity, making detection extremely difficult.

# Will a VPN slow down my internet?

Premium VPNs minimize speed loss. Tests showed only an 18% drop from baseline speeds when using obfuscation with PIA, which is minimal and worth the privacy trade-off.

# Can I access Wikipedia and social media in Turkey?

Yes, with a VPN you can access all blocked platforms including Wikipedia, Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, and YouTube—even during government-imposed blackouts.

# What happens if my VPN disconnects in Turkey?

This is why a kill switch is essential. It automatically blocks all internet traffic if your VPN connection drops, preventing your real IP address and activity from being exposed.

# Final Recommendation

Turkey's internet censorship shows no signs of easing in 2025. Whether you're a resident, expat, or traveler, a reliable VPN has become essential for basic internet freedom.

**Our top pick: ExpressVPN** offers the best balance of reliability, speed, and ease of use. Its automatic obfuscation means you don't have to worry about technical configurations—it just works.

**Budget alternative: Surfshark** provides excellent value with unlimited device connections and NoBorders mode, proven effective during Turkey's recent social media blackouts.

**For advanced users: Private Internet Access** offers the customization needed to fine-tune your connection for optimal performance in Turkey's challenging environment.

Remember: Subscribe and download your VPN **before** arriving in Turkey, as accessing VPN websites becomes difficult once you're in the country.

All recommended VPNs offer 30-day money-back guarantees, allowing you to test them risk-free and ensure they work with your Turkish ISP.

I know this is a subject some people shy away, which is strange because somehow talking about sexual themes in videogame is somehow Taboo.. Just to start off, yes I know this game isn't gonna be a sex simulator where you can have it anytime you want and its not gonna be a full blown Porn game, so no im hoping for that, because I know that's not what is gonna happen lol. One thing I do hope for is that Rockstar allows for full customizing and freedom to do whatever you want to do with your character. 

  
That being said, the two screenshots I have above show a few things.

1.  Picture one of the people on the beach - Speaking of your character, so you can clearly see how everyone's skin tone is different because of being in the Sun and how some NPCs are fat and chubby or in shape. Now the obvious thing that draws your eye is the guy looking at the woman sun bathing; and the most interesting thing is she is topless. So this either suggests that NPCs are gonna be like that and be partly naked, plus perhaps you can be as well. It wouldn't be weird at all considering there are plenty of Triple A games where you can walk around topless/naked if you want to and nobody really cares, because the saying goes, just let a player express themselves the way they want. IE BG3, Cyberpunk, Elden Ring Etc. 

  
2- Picture #2 - We obviously know what the draw of this screenshot is, the design of the characters is very life like. As i mentioned in the first picture, I hope Rockstar allows for full Customizing, Cause I cant imagine they put THAT much detail into Character models and not allow your change every single inch of them, and yes that includes the bust lol



So as i mentioned in the beginning, I know GTA6 isnt gonna be a game where you will have Full blown Sex, and you can call me a gooner if you want, but considering currently in GTA5, when you spawn in GTA online and you see yourself in the shower, youre in a bikini instead of being naked lol. I just would think that a game in which you kill 100s of people, sell Drugs, Steal Cars and do ALL sorts of crime,  but Too much Nudity would be out of bounds lol. I remember i asked this question about a year ago, and people mentioned that Rockstar doesnt wanna mess with Nudity because of what happened with hot Coffee, but as i mentioned, there are so many games nowadays that allow you to walk around naked if you really want to, and those games are still around too. 

  
Final point, considering this games main story is going to be tied around Boobie who owns Strip clubs and/or Dance clubs, that will highly suggest nudity will be a common thing. Not to mention, Lucia and Jason are together as a couple..so theres that as well. ",2,1764481998.0,GTA6,4,0.67,False

Can people please tell me their experiences and advice?

I intend to just travel around and enjoy natural things - such as pubs, coffee and looking around. The countries I intend to visit are France, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic, Italy (Alps), Netherlands and Denmark.

My reason for traveling is so that I can go watch the Winter Olympics.

I'm someone who enjoys pub and cafe culture - it's where I find the most human interaction enjoyment. I will be solo for the first three weeks of the travel.

This cafe opened in May and before that my boss had no prior experience in owning a business or working at a cafe with espresso drinks (pretty sure she’s been a stay at home mom for the last 14 years). I have been the only full time barista since mid August when the students had to start school.

*HEY! I didn’t know where to put this but there is a “Background” section about myself at the end.*

My schedule is 6:30am to around 4pm (sometimes earlier like 3:30pm if I get things closed earlier) and I work 4 days a week. Some weeks I start at 8am on two of the days. I am the only barista most of the days and I also take orders. My boss is sometimes there to help from 9am-2pm but she is usually in the kitchen. There is a girl who works with me on two of the days from 6:30am to 9am and on those days I usually start at 8am since no one comes in that early and having two people at the front is pointless.

Since I started full time my boss has been putting a lot of her stress on me in certain ways. She will expect me to be perfect in a way. If I make a mistake and apologize it’s not good enough. For example, I messed up and order and since she was gone I texted her apologizing that i messed up send asked if I should call and let them know it would be a few minutes late. She responded with “it’s blah blah, they can’t just move their lunch around.” I didn’t know what she wanted from me then because I was trying to do all I could to fix it and get the order out fast. I told her I wasn’t sure what she wanted me to do then and she responded with “well, first off I want you to read the orders.” I stopped looking at the texts at that point and continued working on the order and helping out the kitchen while also taking orders and making drinks. We got the order out only 8 minutes late and I apologized a lot to the people when they came in to grab it. They were totally fine with it being a few minutes late.

Other things she’ll say is stuff like “if we don’t make more money we will go bankrupt and we put everything into this.” Her husband is a high paid local government worker, they own a giant house with a pool and hot tub, have a vast support network of family, friends, and even from the community… theres been a lot of comments like this… ones that are not something you need to tell your employee. I told her once that things like that just put more pressure on me and stress me out and she told me that she was just sharing with me because she thought we were friends and more than just employee and employer. I want to be friends with her but that doesn’t mean you she should be putting more pressure on me just because she’s stressed. Im treated like a manager but haven’t been given a raise or title.

Recently (like 2 weeks ago) she hired a new barista to work on days that I can’t or other people cant. My boss thinks this woman is amazing. She’s worked at different jobs all over town, worked at different coffee shops all over town, knows so many people, and is in her 30s instead of early 20s like me… my boss I think kind of views me like a little sister or someone to mentor while this new lady can be a cool peer. This new lady has basically taken over all the responsibilities that I actually enjoyed. It feels like Im getting replaced in a way. I mean, it’s good that I might have less pressure on me but at the same time I don’t want to suddenly have someone be my manager after I’ve basically been the manager… it feels kinda like the time I was a senior in high school working for a fast food place and the boss hired a new girl to be the supervisor because she was a freshman in college and had worked for the company less. I hate being told how to do my job by people who have been doing my job less than me…

My sister works some Saturdays and I recently gave her one of my shifts she wanted because I wanted a day off since my stomach hurt a bit lol. My sister is in college and will have winter break off and would then be able to work week days. She told me that my boss was thinking about giving us three (the new lady, my sister and I) equal hours during winter break. So instead of working full time 4 days a week I would be reduced to 2 days a week… my sister was not happy about this for me either.

The stress of the job and how Im treated is kinda getting to me and I think I want to find a second job and just reduce my hours… the thing is…

*BACKGROUND: I have epilepsy and cannot drive and the public transportation is absolutely terrible (like I could walk and it would take less time) but it’s becoming winter and the whether can get to the negatives some days. Because of my epilepsy I wasn’t able to do an internship that I needed to graduate from college this last May… Im trying to work it out but I might not be able to do it for two or three years or even more. I have been working at coffee shops the past 4 years as a barista and do really enjoy it. I have also worked at my colleges housekeeping cleaning bathrooms and really didn’t mind that either lol… I don’t have much other experience though. I worked at a gas station for a while and at crumbl for a bit. I worked at a summer camp in a kitchen prepping food and washing dishes and also worked at a different camp as a photographer as well as social media manager.

I have more experience in photography for things like yearbooks or school sports as well as having a hobby in film photography but I don’t think I can really become a freelance photographer or want to. I like editing photos and my mom has suggested looking for jobs where I would edit photos but I don’t know where to start with that…*

There are a few restaurants in walking distance but I don’t really want a second job that I have to interact with people… there is a job I saw as a custodian nearby and im thinking about that?

I just don’t know what to do… I want to cut back my hours and find another part time job, especially if my boss is wanting to do that for winter break, but I also don’t know what I could do…",1,1764481804.0,WorkAdvice,0,1.0,False

The basement has separate entry and was previously used as separate living space. I'm wanting to turn this into a potential mid/short term rental. This would be owner/occupant, where I live upstairs and rent the basement. What regulations do I need to abide by? What are the specific building codes for a shared basement/rental?  
   
I checked the [city ordinance site](https://library.municode.com/mo/kansas_city/codes/code_of_ordinances) but could only definitions of long term resident.  

Currently no kitchen installed but a ""kitchenette"" (sink, microwave, coffee maker, mini- fridge) could be easily fashioned. There's a full bathroom, with shower & tub. It's substantially bigger than the upstairs bathroom. There are 3 very old windows but they're all about 32""x22"".  
  
I know I need to register it first but I want to address any thing that needs fixed before doing so. What do I do? What's the most inexpensive but legal route for an owner occupant to make their basement a midterm/short-term rental?   ",0,1764481698.0,kansascity,0,0.33,False

1paai6s,https://i.redd.it/i79p18hl0c4g1.jpeg,The Secret to Irresistible Chocolate Cake (And Why Yours Might Not Rise Right),"If you’ve ever pulled a chocolate cake out of the oven and felt disappointed — maybe it sank in the middle, turned dense, or just didn’t taste as chocolatey as you hoped — trust me, you’re not the only one.

Most home bakers think great chocolate cake comes from the “perfect recipe,” but honestly?
It’s the technique that makes the biggest difference.

After years of baking (and ruining plenty of cakes), I learned that a few tiny changes can take a chocolate cake from good to “who made this?!”
Here are the biggest ones to know.



1. Bloom Your Cocoa Powder

Cocoa powder by itself tastes dry and slightly bitter.
But when you mix it with hot water or hot coffee, it “blooms” and unlocks deeper flavor.

If your cake tastes weak or plain → bloom your cocoa first.
This one step instantly boosts flavor.



2. Don’t Overmix

Overmixing knocks out the air you need for a good rise.
Undermixing leaves lumps that ruin the texture.

The trick:
Mix until smooth — then stop.



3. Oil Makes a Softer, More Moist Cake

Butter adds flavor, but oil gives you that bakery-style soft crumb everyone loves.
Most rich chocolate cakes use oil for this reason.



4. Use Buttermilk for Better Texture

Buttermilk does three things that normal milk can’t:
	•	softens the cake
	•	gives the chocolate deeper flavor
	•	reacts with baking soda for a better rise

Switching to buttermilk is an instant upgrade.



5. Add Hot Water at the End

This is the baker’s secret.
Pour ½ cup of hot water into the batter right before baking.

The batter will look thin — don’t panic.
This is what creates that moist, silky, melt-in-your-mouth texture.


Why This Matters for Anyone Who Bakes a Lot

People forget most cakes they eat…
But they remember the one that was extra moist, extra soft, and extra chocolatey.

When someone tastes a cake that feels different, the first thing they ask is:

“Do you take orders?”

Mastering these simple techniques turns your baking into something people talk about.

1paabgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1paabgc/got_my_diagnosis/,Got my diagnosis...,"A week before my 40th birthday I got diagnosed with an atypical generalized epilepsy. Buckle up, cuz this will be a novel.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I'll start from the beginning. Back in July, I had my first seizure ever. Started as a normal day. Wake up at 6AM, and get ready for work. I had gotten out of the shower, and was talking to my wife while I was fixing my hair. ***This is where it all goes black for me. I don't remember anything beyond this point*** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife said that I had stopped what I was doing, turned and just blankly stared at her. Then walked in circles a few times and then fell backwards hit my shoulder on the edge of our claw foot tub which flipped me onto my stomach and started seizing(We believe it was a Tonic-clonic). She runs in screaming at me obviously terrified, and gets a towel under my face so I don't keeping smacking it against the floor and gets her phone to call 911. The paramedics eventually arrive and try to settle me so they could get me out to the ambo. They however were unable to control me (They were apparently on the smaller side, and I'm 5'9"", and 250lbs+ so not exactly ""skinny"" these poor women had to wrestle my naked ass...thank god I had just showered at least lol) they had to call in some firemen lift me out on some special stretcher. Eventually I wake up in the hospital probably first around 9am, with my wife sitting next to me and tells me I've had a seizure. I'm beyond confused, and tell her to make sure and tell my boss that I won't be in (We work at the same company) and then pass back out. I slip in and out of consciousness for the next few hours. Reiterating to tell my boss, asking for more water, and subsequently needing to pee a lot. I was finally coherent probably around 1pm. I had completely dislocated my shoulder and chipped a chunk of bone off. They put me under in the afternoon to reset it and then put it in a sling. I spent the night in hospital, and just remember having to get up to pee over and over and each step was excruciating walking to and from that bed. For whatever reason the hydrocodone that they were giving me had little to no effect on the pain. My wife came back in the morning and I got discharged to go home. I've seen plenty of seizures in movies and what not but I guess it never clicked with me that the seizing part of it are wild muscle contractions. My back was/is so incredibly screwed up that I had to sleep on the couch for the first week because our mattress is too stiff so I would just end up in pain after a few minutes. My shoulder still being extremely sore and my left arm was basically useless meant I couldn't sleep on the side I usually do. Not to mention, anytime I sat up from laying down I was out of breath for a few moments and basically had to do lamaze breathing to catch my breath because it hurt to breath so I could only take small breaths. The prevailing theory at this point is that a combination of working too much, way too stressed, not enough sleep and chugging red bulls is the culprit. So I swear off all Red Bull, coffee and I don't actively seek out caffeine anymore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about a month of physical recovery, I go back to a neurologist at the hospital and review the events and she schedules me for a couple tests. CT Scan, and EEG (We did an MRI, and CT while I was at the hospital for the seizure). I feel I should mention that as per Canadian driving law my license is by default suspended for 6 months so Uber has been making bank off me. The CT scan was boring, but the EEG test was a little more interesting she had me do a bunch of blinking, and breathing in and out of my nose test which was super unpleasant. Either way, tests are done and a few weeks later the neurologist calls me back to say the EEG showed ""signs"" of epilepsy. She puts me on a general seizure med called Keppra and refers me to an epileptologist. I'm on Vyvanse for my ADHD, and Telmisartan for my blood pressure already. But holy shit, this Keppra drug is AWFUL. The side effects of it for me at least have been depression or just an overall apathy, no sleep, ZERO energy and just way more irritable. I'm more of an introverted person anyways, but I'm a generally and easy going, positive kind of person so this is abnormal for me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of a month and a half I get pretty much nowhere with scheduling the specialist. Starting to get incredibly frustrated with this process and this drug, and one night I forget to take my PM Keppra. In the morning, I say ""fuck it, it's her birthday I'm not gunna take this and be a whiny bitch all day"" The day proceeds as usual and everything seems to go well. I tell her after dinner that I hadn't taken the Keppra and she instantly tears a strip off me...and rightfully so. We settle it, and go to our typical night cap of gaming till bed time in our offices. I join voice chat and start talking with my friends before we queue up to play Battlefield 6 and you guessed it...***This is where it all goes black for me. I don't remember anything beyond this point***.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife hears a loud thudding and looks across the hall and see me seizing in my chair. Runs out of her office screaming at me and calls 911. She got me out of my chair and onto the floor so she could flip me onto my side since I was foaming at the mouth as well. Luckily the paramedics this time were two big dudes who had to problem handling me. One of the friends heard what was happening through voice chat and, the other called his wife who was in the next town over. They both rushed over to help, one drove the wife to the hospital while the other watched over our animals. I woke up in the ambo this time and spoke to the paramedic. He had asked me if I hadn't taken my meds to which I obviously confessed and then passed back out. Woke up in the hospital a few hours later to my wife letting me know I had another seizure. Imagine that, not taking your meds like an idiot triggers a seizure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another few days of needing to sleep on the couch, I'd fractured my shoulder since I didn't really stick the landing getting out of my chair. So took like 10 steps back in the physical therapy of that injury. Also, had aspirated into my lungs so I needed some anti-biotics for that. I ate nothing but water and apple sauce for like 3 days because my stomach was like ""nah, we're good"". After a couple weeks, and I'm coherent enough I both call the neurologist to explain I've had another seizure, and then also emailed them pleading to cycle me onto a medication that doesn't make me want to die. After a week I hear back that the neurologist says she'll see me on Nov 19th to talk about switching. Then **magically** a day later the epileptologist schedules a meeting for the same day 15 mins after the neurologist. The neuro cancels so I'm left with just specialist.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally we get to last weekish, I go in and see them and we go through a battery of questions. Like has this happened before, any symptoms before this, any thing I think could be related to it, family history etc etc etc. It's all nope, nope, nope, and nope. To my knowledge there were no indications up till this point. He diagnoses me with an ""atypical"" generalized epilepsy. Atypical since I didn't actually have a seizure until I was 39. Thankfully, he agrees to move me onto Lamotrigine instead of the Keppra. So I'm now in the multi week process of cycling off Keppra and onto Lamotrigine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing we're left with is and emphatic ""um, wtf? HOW???"". How have I lived for nearly 40 years, and literally never had a TC or an absence seizure and someone was like ""Hm, that's weird. We should get that checked out"". The only thing we've thought of is that maybe I've had absent seizures all my life, and it mistakenly might've gotten bundled in with my ADHD and I was just ""spacing out"". Like I've never had a great diet, so all the triggers I've read about those don't really track. I've watched a ton of long-form YT videos, and read a bunch about the varieties of epilepsy, the medications, treatments since I had the first seizure so I'm trying to get informed. I'm just so lost, and annoyed that I've lived almost half my life not knowing about this only to find out now?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've had ADHD my whole life and have medication for it. I've worked hard at learning how to work in the confines of those limitations and build an infrastructure that works for me but I'd love to hear from some veterans about their experiences dealing with epilepsy, the diagnosis, processing it or this alleged ""aura"" I've heard about where people can feel a seizure coming as it happens. Anyways, thanks for reading if you made it this far!   
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**TLDR:** Had a seizure in July @ the ripe age of 39, and it messed up my my whole body physically. Saw a neurologist and got on meds for seizures. Drugs were awful, so tried to not take them once. Had another seizure. Pleaded with the neurologist to get me different meds. Got to see an epileptologist and diagnosed with atypical generalized epilepsy.",2,1764480623.0,Epilepsy,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Chargers vs. Raiders: A Tale of Two Teams (and Why the Raiders Need a Miracle to Win)**

The Los Angeles Chargers (7-4) and Las Vegas Raiders (2-9) are set to clash at SoFi Stadium on November 30, 2025, in what promises to be a game as lopsided as a toaster in a bakery. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this might be the Raiders’ least magical Monday of the season.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Chargers Are the NFL’s Version of Gravity

The Chargers are a staggering **9.5-point favorites**, with a moneyline of -620 (implying a **86% chance to win** per implied probability). For context, that’s like betting the sun will rise tomorrow—but with less poetic ambiguity. Los Angeles’ home record (4-2) and dominant performance as favorites (60% win rate) suggest they’re the NFL’s version of a coffee shop that *always* has your order ready.

The Raiders, meanwhile, are +411 underdogs, which translates to a **25% implied win probability**. That’s roughly the chance of surviving a game of Russian roulette with a comically oversized wheel. Vegas’ 9.5-point spread? Let’s call it the “math test” the Raiders haven’t studied for. They’ve only covered the spread once as underdogs of 8.5+ points this season (1-1 ATS), and their away record (1-4) is about as reliable as a umbrella in a hurricane.

The over/under is 40.5 points, but here’s the kicker: Chargers games average **5.2 points *****more*** than this total, while Raiders games average **4.0 points *****less***. The model predicts the **Over** will hit in 64% of simulations, meaning fantasy footballers should pack their bags for a fireworks show—even if the Raiders’ offense is about as explosive as a wet sock.

---

### Digesting the News: Herbert’s Redemption Arc vs. Raiders’ “We’re Not Even Trying” Defense

Justin Herbert, the Chargers’ star QB, had a Week 11 performance so abysmal it could’ve powered a “How *Not* to Throw a Football” seminar. But fear not! Analysts predict a rebound, with a **-122 line on him throwing over 1.5 TDs**. At home, Herbert has 12 TDs in six games—double his road total. The Raiders’ pass defense, ranked 18th in the league, might as well be a sieve hosting an open house for quarterbacks.

1paa30j,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1paa30j/i_31m_and_my_ex_24f_met_for_coffee_for_the_first/,I 31M and my ex 24F met for coffee for the first time in 9 months since the break up and I am more confused. Do I let her go or do I keep trying?,"So 9 months ago on a random afternoon my ex video called me and broke up with me. We were engaged for about year. Prior to us meeting she had been diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorders and was also taking medication for depression. Despite all of that I thought that she was the coolest, great values and such a strong character and damn she was brave. I know things were a little shaky before we ended I was working in an environment that demanded 70 to 80 hour work weeks and my time became limited. But I had been making plans to get a different job and to take care of myself better so I could be a more stable and I suppose attractive partner. In the months that followed the break up she went completely radio silent. Like what ever I felt didn't matter. I at first fell off the wagon but eventually I picked myself up and tried to keep the promises I made. I became physically active and fit and lost a lot of weight, I changed jobs which offered me more flexibility and financial stability and most of all I worked on my relationship with God and got baptized. And though I want to be in a relationship I still wanted her. And I couldn't pursue anyone else because I know the damage unresolved feeling could have. A few days ago I was working in her area and decided to call her after months of no contact to see if she would like to go an have coffee. After a few hours she agreed. When I picked her up and during the session things felt so natural like reality was not aligning to the circumstances. We talked and laughed and actively tried to avoid conversation of the past. The evening naturally had some nostalgic moments. And I noticed her anxiety flairing up. By the end she just looked emotionally drained. I on the other hand felt incredibly at peace and I was happier than I had been in a long time. I think she still loves me and she obviously cares for me but I don't think she has the capacity right now to sustain a relationship with me. I only sent one follow up message saying thanks and that I enjoyed seeing her again and she responded in a very short an controlled way. I have no idea what she is thinking or feeling and I still don't know the full reason why she broke up with me. I asked her if she would prefer me not contacting her anymore and she said she doesn't know. Neither of us have been on any dates since the break up. So I guess the advice I need is do I walk away from this person that I love because she is not capable right now to express or even know what she wants and maybe she is going through her own emotional turmoil? Or do I keep trying? and if so how do I go about it? more than my own desires I want her to be okay and happy and healthy even if it is without me. Right now it seems like either way I will lose her and if thats the case I guess I would rather lose her knowing that I shared exactly how I feel instead of pussyfooting around things to preserve some sense of useless pride.",0,1764479879.0,relationship_advice,5,0.33,False

The first day on vyvanse was pretty good and I was slightly more focused but it's been downhill ever since. 

On day 2 I had noticeably less focus, I figured it was dehydration/nutrition so I got electrolytes and ate enough protein.

Day 3 was even worse, around 1pm my family and I noticed that I was getting quite irritable, depressed and I didn't really feel like doing anything. 

Today, I tried taking it with eggs for the protein. No difference. I haven't felt this unmotivated since before starting the dexedrine. I got extremely depressed and tired around 1pm, which definitely isn't normal for me. I would also snap at every little annoyance. My mood got a little better around 5pm because I had a coffee but I've done nothing except scroll on my phone since then.

The depression is quite concerning, to the point where I'm scared it'll get worse if I keep taking it. I'm very disappointed since vyvanse seems to be a miracle pill for most.

I don't know if it's worth pushing through or trying the brand name when I don't even know if this feeling will go away... The pharmacist told me to give it at least a week but the mental health issue seems serious and it's been getting worse daily. Could the vyvanse really make me feel this horrible at such a low dose?

We’ve been texting all week. He asked me for a date tonight but I told him I work till 830. He told me to come to his place so he could cook us dinner. We have a lot of mutual friends so I figured it was safe. I asked him what he planned to cook and he said, “It’s a surprise.” He asked me if there are any foods that I definitely do NOT like, so I assumed he was putting a lot of thought into it. 

When I got there, The place was a total mess. Empty cans, empty potato chip bags, dirty dishes on the coffee table, dishes piled up on the sink and countertops, clothes thrown everywhere…like a stereotypical frat house. Except this man is 29 and lives alone. I tried to ignore it but part of me was a bit offended that he didn’t even try to make an effort to clean. I’m not a neat freak by ANY means but really? 

Anyway, he says he ordered Chinese food and it’s on its way. I casually asked if he changed his mind about cooking. He then nonchalantly told me that he planned to MAKE Chinese food, but his oven was “acting funny” all day so he figured ordering it was the next best thing. Um…ok. I get that shit happens, but kind of weird he didn’t mention that earlier in the day since he seemed so eager to cook for me in the first place. I honestly think he never had the intention of cooking but didn’t think I’d call him out on it. 

Anyway, we sit down on the couch and he’s watching a tv show. He expects me to be into it right away. He started it explaining things to me as if I had only missed the first 5 minutes, and not several seasons. No attempt at conversation about anything other than the show and a few comments about the food when it arrived. He turned on another episode after the first one was over. After an hour of watching a show I didn’t want to watch, I started to scroll through my phone and that’s when he finally said, “Sorry, I guess I’m being rude. What do you want to watch?” 

I took this as an opportunity to tell him that I was tired and wanted to go home. He looked confused but asked me what it is that I wanted to do that would make the night better. I wasn’t comfortable getting into all of that while I was inside his place so I just said I was tired  and left. However I did text him afterward and explain that he was very misleading. He made it seem like we’d have a romantic evening and he didn’t even have the decency to clean or give me a heads up that his “oven broke”. And hey, I’m cool with take out, but at least be honest. I also told him that it’s difficult to get to know someone when you’re making them watch a tv show that they’ve never seen before. I told him that it was obvious he just wanted to hook up and that’s not what I’m looking for. His response was, “My bad, I didn’t realize you were so high maintenance. You seemed cool and chill at the wedding so I figured I didn’t need to be so extra, but I really like you.” I decided not to respond but then he texted again and asked me for another chance. I haven’t answered. What would you say? AITAH?

1pa9y6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pa9y6f/to_be_or_not_to_be_friends_24f_29m/,To be or not to be friends (24F & 29M),"I don’t know really where to start this. We met in February this year on a ski trip, and he invited me to his birthday party. I remember in the car him and his best friend were talking about relationships and when they asked about me, I said I think romance is propaganda. We would see each other here and there and social situations like board game nights and other events, he even hosted a dinner party where he invited me. Things picked up as we texted and we started having sex in May. The sex was so good and I enjoyed our company and our dynamics together. I loved learning from him as he’s a walking encyclopedia to ask questions. He would often invite me to things (trivia, karoke, watchparties, coffee after sex), but I would say no in fear the attachment. We did a couple of times though like waterfront walks and I invited him to my friend’s event. We always acknowledged the fun would have to end. He had surgery in September which was a tough month and being on medical leave I saw him at some of his worst, which I anticipated. I felt like his girlfriend when I visited him and did a little of caretaking but I told him even if I wasn’t the one I’m still grateful to be here in this moment. The week before my birthday I abruptly crash out and say we should stop, but we both end up overwhelmed by our emotions as he says he doesn’t want to lose a friend and we see each other again. Then he asks me about dinner on a saturday night, but is vague about so I think it’s a date but it’s more meant to be a serious conversation about the sustainability of us. He expresses how we reverted to old habits and wanted to be more intentional, and that he tends to hold things in which can hurt people. He talks about how relationships he’s seen from his friends are the merging of two lives falling in unison together (but it’s never like he gave me a chance to do this. Maybe he thought I valued my freedom and independence too much in how I lead my own life). I acknowledge it but we still keep texting that week. He hosts a small dinner party on Friday night (that he didn’t invite me to) and then the next night I ask if I can bring leftover bread pudding. We have sex again and the morning of I confront him about what he truly wants considering I thought he wanted to break up a week ago but then wanted me the night before. I ask him if he wants this to be our last time and he says no. I ask more questions and then he says he also shares the sentiment of liking each other and caring for me, but doesn’t have feelings for me like I do. I ask him why he was still texting me and he says he was weak. In my head I wish he was assertive. I say I don’t want to be a dog following him around and I need dignity, and I need to put my foot down in no texting. Our last interaction here really upsets me because he basically keeps hugging me tightly and pouts saying he’s sorry…and it just makes me feel pathetic like he pities me. It’s been 2 weeks since and we’re still in no contact but he still shares his location with me. He may or may not attend a friend’s birthday party this upcoming Saturday and I’m nervous about seeing him in public. 

I’ve never dated before and I’m not sure if I would call this love but it definitely hurts like heartbreak. It might be withdrawals like his gentle affection and check-ins but I really liked a lot about him. I solo traveled during Thanksgiving and I know it wouldn’t solve many problems, but coming back to the city, it feels like a pendulum where my emotions keep swinging. I thought changing beds like dog sitting and being in hostels would help.  

I guess I entered the friends with benefits because I knew it would always be safe because of our age gap that it would never be logical to date. I was much more thinking with my brain before but then my heart fell in. His care sent me mixed signals because he got me a rice cooker for my bday when I burnt my rice and kind of acted like my boyfriend during my bday party. He remembered what sweater I wore the night he hosted a smores gathering. He kept my sticky note (in cursive which he can’t read), my tooth brush in his bathroom, let me borrow his clothes, calmed me down, asked me for advice, shared his troubles…amongst other things.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/1BNsgEs3Fx): **February 9, 2025**

I (31F) am at my wit's end with my husband's (32M) coworker Sarah (30F), and his complete inability to see what's happening. I'm not usually one for reddit, but I need to know if I'm going crazy here.

Where do I even start? Three years ago, my husband Mark started working with Sarah. At first, I tried to be welcoming. I invited her to our BBQs, included her in group outings, and genuinely tried to be friendly. Big mistake. She spent the entire time making backhanded comments about everything from my career (""Oh, you're just a yoga instructor? How... peaceful."") to my cooking (""I guess not everyone can master basic seasoning."").

The real problem is that Mark thinks she's ""just being funny."" Last month, she literally threw away the anniversary mug I gave him because it ""clashed with the office aesthetic."" When I got upset, Mark said I was being too sensitive and that ""Sarah just has high standards for office decor."" IT WAS A MUG WITH OUR WEDDING PHOTO ON IT.

Some greatest hits from Sarah: - She scheduled a ""mandatory"" work dinner on our anniversary - She convinced Mark not to take a promotion because it would mean working with a different team - She posts daily photos of them together with hashtags like #WorkPowerCouple and #WorkSpouse - She tells everyone at their office that she ""takes better care of him than I do"" - She changed his coffee order and now tells everyone she ""trained him right""

The worst part? My husband is completely blind to all of this. Yesterday, he actually told me about how Sarah said our new house (which we spent months searching for) was ""charming, in a starter home kind of way."" He repeated this while LAUGHING.

I tried talking to him about it, but Sarah has convinced him I'm ""just insecure."" She's managed to insert herself into every aspect of our lives. They text constantly - even on weekends. She knows his schedule better than I do. She rearranged his entire desk and office wardrobe because his style was ""too suburban husband."" THAT'S WHAT HE IS!

Last week, I suggested marriage counseling. He looked genuinely confused. He of course went and talked to Sarah about it I found out from another coworker that she's been telling people that Mark and I are ""going through a rough patch"" and that she's ""just being a good friend by giving him someone to talk to."" We weren't going through anything until she started this nonsense!

The breaking point? I stopped by his office to surprise him with lunch (I know, I know, but it was his birthday and Sarah was supposedly out sick). Guess who was there? Sarah. She'd ""miraculously recovered"" and bought him a cake that said ""To my work hubby"" with a photo of them from the office holiday party. She saw me and said, ""Oh, Amy! You came too... how nice. Mark, you didn't tell me your real wife was coming!""

I'm not crazy, right? This woman is trying to destroy my marriage while my husband stands there grinning like it's all some big joke. What do I do? Divorce seems extreme, but I'm running out of options here.

TL;DR: My husband's ""work wife"" is actively trying to sabotage our marriage while he remains completely oblivious to her obvious manipulation.

ETA: I should have stated that the promotion wasn't one that would increase his salary but his title. It would give him more leadership experience. It still blows my mind that he turned it down just so he could stay on the same team as her.

ETA: I should have told the mug story in its entirety. She ""accidentally"" broke the mug. I noticed it was gone when I was visiting him one day and I asked him about it. He said she accidentally knocked it over and then later he repeated a ""joke"" she made about how it didn't fit the office aesthetic.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** You have a husband problem. Go to counseling and get professional help to communicate your concerns. Remind him that he’s married to you, not Sarah so her opinions shouldn’t matter when it comes to your marriage. Good luck, but be prepared for the worst. 

**Commenter 2:** Sarah would not be able to sabotage your marriage if your husband wasn't allowing it.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/nLg7yjfIhN): **February 12, 2025 (three days later)**

Hi! I (31F) posted a few days ago. I really didn't expect my post to blow up the way it did. I got so overwhelmed by all the comments that I haven't responded to any. I want to address everyone who says it's fake - I understand why you think that, but this is my personal hell. I only listen to Reddit stories on TikTok, but when this reached its boiling point, I just needed a place to talk. So I made an account and tried to yell into the void. Well, the void turned out to be less empty than I thought!

Now, to why everyone is here - the update: Before I talked to my husband (32M), I decided to do some investigation. I started with his phone and read all the messages between him and Sarah. She bad-mouthed me a few times (he did nothing to defend me but didn't engage either). She was flirty; he wasn't really flirty back. They talked a lot, and he praised her frequently for her work ethic and intelligence. I didn't see anything about cheating. I checked his email - nothing. I checked his work email - nothing. I looked through our other devices - nothing. I searched high and low for a second phone - nothing. Everything I found was always dancing that line. Nothing was outright cheating, but here are the things I found that did hurt my feelings:

\• He has lunch with her, and only her, every day in the office. They don't really like anyone else, so they'll criticize others and say, ""Let's talk more at lunch, they're serving xyz today.""

\• He'd say things like ""I'm sure if you were a wife, you would xyz."" He always kept it as ""a wife"" and not ""my wife,"" but it still upset me.

\• She admitted to breaking the mug on purpose. He didn't get upset with her, just said, ""Yeah, the photo gifts are kind of corny.""

I confronted him. I laid it all out, and while he wasn't upset, he did try to brush things off. He said I was being sensitive and overreacting. I told him if we didn't have a real conversation about this, I would file for divorce. That got his attention, and he sat down with me.

He admitted that at first, he found it odd that Sarah was trying so hard - he saw her trying hard with all the men in the office. The more attention she gave him, the more he enjoyed it, and the more he responded, the more attention she gave, until she just had her sights on him. He knew some of the other men were envious, and he liked that too. He admitted that eventually, he just got too deep. He said he knew it was wrong but had gotten addicted to the attention and didn't want her to move on to another man. So he indulged her sometimes at my expense. He said it was just nice to have two women in the two major parts of his life, stating that he knew we'd rarely see one another, so what was the harm? He reiterated that he never EVER physically cheated with her but admitted it could be called an emotional affair.

It was painful, I won't hide that. I mean REALLY painful - like I wasn't enough. I told him from this point on, he needed to stop communicating with Sarah and ask to be transferred or switch jobs altogether. Now folks, I mean it when I tell you this:

He. Lost. His. Shit.

He began raising his voice, saying things like he never cheated, it was all above board, and I couldn't control who he talked with at work. He called me a narcissist and a control freak. He told me I had no idea how hard it was, how much stress he had in the office, and that his personal relationship with Sarah helps a lot - taking it away would just damage his mental health. It got so bad that I started crying. I couldn't take it anymore and decided to leave. I packed a small bag and called my MIL - she's the only family I have here. I gave her a rundown of what was going on, and she offered her home to me. I'm staying here and just hoping my husband calms down so we can revisit this. I want to work it out; I love him more than anything.

I will try harder to answer comments on this post, and I will definitely update if something new happens. This has been really therapeutic and makes me feel less alone.

TLDR: I confronted my husband about his work wife, and he lost it on me. Now I'm staying with my MIL.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** INFO: what does MIL have to say about all of this? Has she talked to her son, your husband?

> **OOP:** My MIL is on my side and told me point blank that he is wrong. However, she said she doesn't want to get in the middle bc she doesn't want to damage the relationship with either one of us. She told me I'm welcome as long as I need but she won't bring anything up to her son until he brings it up to her.

**Commenter 2:** Has he tried to contact you since you left what does your mil say about his actions it’s time he either stops contact moves to a different job he has to get away he is thriving on her attention it’s all not fair maybe counseling but he might be to far gone maybe it’s time to move on he is choosing her over you I’m so sorry I feel your pain stay strong maybe go do something nice for yourself maybe your hair or nails or a new outfit just something for YOU 

> **OOP:** My MIL agrees his actions are wrong but doesn't want things to escalate or to damage her relationship with either one of us so she is staying out of it unless he contacts her.
> 
> As for my husband he has tried to reach out. He's called left message texted. I let him know I was safe and left it at that. He will message or call every few hours but we haven't talked.

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/u/Honeybellmama/s/mFV81dS5Wg): **February 14, 2025 (two days later)**

Well, I'm back!

First, I want to address some of the negative comments. To all the people saying they're ""team Sarah"" and hoping Sarah and my husband get together – I even saw a nasty comment saying Sarah and my husband would be ""the office power couple"" – how can you sit here and say nothing's going on? You claim my husband didn't cheat and I'm being crazy, yet in the same breath wish they would get together? You're contradicting yourself because deep down you know something romantic was developing.

Now for the update.

My husband came to my MIL's house (she didn't call him). He knew I was there because I told him, and he said he wanted to talk. Some big things happened in such a short time.

He wanted to explain. According to my husband, after I left, he started to reflect, he did call his mom and they had a long talk (I didn't know any of this) She asked him if he was happy with me and he said yes but I made him extremely happy. I was a good wife and a great partner. This is kind of what it all sunk into him that he was being juvenile for wanting attention from another woman. I did ask him why he always brushed things off and never took action before. He said He couldn't explain it – it just felt good. He assured me he never wanted to sleep with her and never advanced things that way. It was just nice having someone around who was fawning over him, like a fan.

For those who said he didn't know what an emotional affair was and was just agreeing with me – you were right. He admitted he didn't really understand what an emotional affair was, but after looking it up, he agreed that's what it was, though unintentional. He said he didn't want to lose his friend, so he just went along with a lot of what she did. He admitted he was deep into a fog but me leaving And this conversation with his mom was the one thing that brought him out of it. He said he didn't want to fight. My husband is big on giving me my space so when I left he didn't chase after me because he thought it would be best for us to just cool down and think about this and hopefully come back and discuss it more rationally.

He did reach out to Sarah. Though they didn't meet in person, they had a phone call. He told her they couldn't remain as close, that their out-of-office texts and calls needed to stop, that he would get a replacement mug she wasn't to touch, and that they needed to cut back on their lunches. He wanted to handle this before talking to me, to show he was serious.

Sarah didn't take it well. She started berating me, saying I was forcing him to do this. My husband stopped her and said no – he was doing this because his marriage was important. He admitted letting things go too far but clarified he had no romantic interest in her. He told her if she had feelings for him, she needed to distance herself immediately.

Sarah ended up ruining their friendship herself. Though my husband was willing to maintain a more distant friendship, her comments about me and him, claiming she'd never want him and that everything she did was because she knew we weren't meant to be together, and she was trying to open his eyes. He said he couldn't believe he'd never seen how vindictive and awful she was – she was almost venomous. It didn't end well.

After handling that situation, he came to see me, wanting to ensure I knew he understood and was taking the proper steps. He said we could do whatever I needed.

I know some of you will say I'm wrong, that divorce is the only option because he had an emotional affair. I'm sorry to disappoint, but I'm not divorcing my husband. I told him we needed counseling for both of us. Yes, going through all his devices, emails, and texts might have been extreme – he agreed it felt like a breach of privacy but understood given the circumstances. I told him we both needed to work on things. As of right now, I guess you could say that we're separated. We're not staying in the same house. We're going to attend counseling. I don't want to just jump back into things with him. I don't want it to seem like it was okay to make me feel like I was the second option to ignore all those red flags and to brush me off. This has to be worked on. I'm leaving his mother's house and staying with a friend

I'm not sure if anyone's going to want an update after this. Sorry it's so anticlimactic sorry it's the typical. Oh you just got back together. I mean it is but it isn't. I love my husband. I know he loves me. I don't think everything is an end-all be-all yes, it's a terrible situation. Yes he did a terrible thing but I want my marriage to last so we're giving it another go.

I genuinely hope this is my last update, but if it's not, Y'all will know. Thank you for all the messages. All the support everything it really has been a huge help.

**Commenter 1:** As a female in a male dominated industry (and employer), the term work wife/work husband sickens me to no end (I've been labeled a colleague's work wife in the past, fortunately, the one who labeled me his work wife vot transferred to a different {new} location when about 18 months ago).

I have two questions for you if you don't mind me asking. Have you looked into his employer's policies on workplace romance? Have you reached out to HR about Sarah, given her patterns at his job? I ask because I fear that things will get worse before it gets better.

> **OOP:** I appreciate it. Work wife and work husband is definitely something that can quickly become disrespectful and cross a lot of boundaries. I'm glad that uncomfortable situation rectified itself for you.
> 
> I did not look into their policies because they didn't really have a workplace to romance. Emotional affairs are such slippery slopes because there's nothing physical going on so there's nothing that HR can really do. Technically in the eyes of policies and stuff they were just good friends. HR can't really control what you do on your personal time Or on your personal social media? Unless it makes the company look especially if there's no sexual component.
> 
> As far as reaching out to HR, I can't do that. I mean I could, but it's ultimately up to my husband and I'm sure he will on Monday and if he does I'll definitely update how that goes.

**Commenter 2:** Hi i'm glad that' you're not going through the typical reddit ""divorce him!"" route. This is real life with real people and real feelings. You have to see if you can work through. This is marriage. It's tough sometimes. When you go through shit like this you go through shit like this together.

Now if he had a physical affair with her, then, yeah divorce him. But since he didn't, it's more nuance than that.

And you know what I would like to hear an update because if things do or don't work out, I want to see you living you're best life with or without him. In the end you'll be coming out stronger than you did your first post.

Edit:

Also, I agree with other posters, you need to tell your husband that distant friendship isn't good enough. That no friendship is the only thing on the table. If he won't agree to that then... maybe divorce is the only option then.

> **OOP:** I know a lot of people have been saying this But you have to understand. My husband still has to work with Sarah. Yes, he could quit his job but finding another job takes time so As of now he has to work with her. So when I said he wanted to maintain a distant friendship, I was meaning that he wanted things to be cordial at work so he didn't just outright cut her off. We had a very long conversation about it and I should have added it into my update but I didn't. When I mentioned him saying distant friendship It wasn't him saying. ""I'm not cutting her off"" it was, ""I don't want this to turn into a big thing at work so I'm going to do this gradually and go ahead and set hard boundaries and then slowly will just drift apart because I'll start pulling away."" I'm not sure if that makes sense, but That was his thought process.

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/Np79inbIqq): **February 18, 2025 (four days later)**

Hi reddit, We are continuing our work wife saga. As a lot of you predicted in my last update, Sarah wasn't happy about my husband ending their friendship and trying to put a distance between him and her. I seriously thought she was going to reach out to me but she never did why? Because this was never about me. I was not even on her radar except for somebody to tear down.

I will give Sarah one thing. She is extremely efficient. She started her campaign long before Monday morning. Over the weekend she reached out to several of my husband's co-workers, (mostly male.) She told them that my husband had randomly stop being friends with her and she suspected it was my fault. She said she couldn't believe it. Everyone knew how close they were. She just felt bad for him. Wanted to be a friend for him and hopefully he help him out of our terrible marriage. She went on and on about how she couldn't believe how much this is going to affect her during her working hours that she didn't know if she can continue working at this job. One of the female workers at my husband's job messaged me all of this.

As a lot of you predicted, she is gearing up to accuse my husband of sexual harassment. Monday alone she has put herself In the path of my husband multiple times. It kind of feels like she's setting up to do and he said she said argument because she's doing a lot of odd things at least according to my husband. Think stuff like intentionally following my husband into a room or a section of the office that is somewhat closed off, accidentally emailing him or forwarding him things, going to his cubicle multiple times day for no reason, sitting close to him in meetings. It seems harmless but really it feels like she's gearing up For something.

My husband did go to HR first thing Monday morning and like I kind of thought they pretty much said they can't do anything unless it affects work or working hours. (His HR is not the greatest) He did let them know what she was doing today but honestly I don't think they took him seriously.

We've been thinking about moving. The only thing that keeps us here is really his mom. So he might just transfer jobs? We're not really sure. I hope things don't escalate anymore and since he went to HR already, I'm hoping that nothing big happens.

I'd like to give a little update about our counseling. To all the people who tell me that I'm making a mistake by giving my husband another chance and trying to work it out. I am so happy I don't listen to you. I understand it was a shitty situation. I lived through it. I know it is. I know how it felt.

But counseling has revealed a lot about my husband that I didn't even know. Apparently he was bullied severely in high school and he kind of went through a little glow up when he went into college. Sarah is definitely one of those stereotypical blonde pretty girls and my husband admits that it did kind of feel like he finally got his chance to be ""popular"" In a social setting. My husband admitted that Sarah basically mirrored everything about him. His likes his dislikes. She talked to him like he walked on water. It definitely sounded like she was boosting his ego In a manipulative fashion.

Like I said I understand this isn't just a forgive and move on kind of situation but hearing my husband talk about it how it felt the way it affected him. It made me have a lot more sympathy for him.

I still haven't come back home but we're doing it one day at a time. I went and had lunch with him on Monday and I'm going again today. I'm trying to be there for him so he doesn't feel alone.

I'm really ready for all this to die down. I'm hoping it doesn't get taken farther at work but if it does we'll deal with it.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** OP, Your husband should be documenting EVERYTHING, IN WRITING. AS IT OCCURS. And then, provide it to management.

In addition, a consultation and possible engagement of a seasoned labor law/employment attorney.

**Commenter 2:** Sounds like it's not going to die down until he leaves. Either he gets a different position in a different team away from Sarah or he quits and finds a new job. Because the way you're explaining stuff she is going to cause massive issues for him at work. And I'm hoping after you said with your counseling that your husband's being smart. I understand you said he went to HR. HR is not going to care because he's a man, since she's not physically doing anything and it's not going to be an issue until she says something he needs a new job.

I would have this conversation with him in counseling and state to him that it's only going to get worse. I've seen this happen time and time again. Nothing's going to change the way Sarah acts and for her to say that she trying to help him get out of a terrible marriage, is already telling enough. She's going to blame everything on you and then blame it on your husband and make it 10 times worse.

I honestly hope the best for you and your husband OP but he really needs to get out of there.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/dJ6EIuew46)  **May 25, 2015**

Throwaway, since my best friend is a redditor. Sorry for length! 

I've known my best friend ""Kevin"" since I was five years old. He is a great friend and a great guy. I've never felt anything but friendship toward him, and, if anything, I consider him to be like a brother to me. I'm not attracted to him physically and have always treated him platonically. I have always kept the affection to a strictly friends level (occasional hugs and whatnot, nothing more) because I don't want to send him confusing signals. 


When we were in high school, Kevin asked me to be his girlfriend and confessed to always having feelings for me. I was 15 and he was 16. I explained that I only saw him as a friend, and my feelings were not going to change. I have always been certain of this. 

After a period of awkwardness, he let it go and we became close friends again, like nothing happened. He also asked me to his senior prom, but to avoid causing confusion, I said no, and he went with someone else instead. I have told him more than once that we are just friends, and I am not looking for anything more from him.


I'm not a very emotional person and have very limited dating experience, but about six months ago I met a guy named ""Mark."" I was instantly attracted to him. We discovered that we complement one another very well and started dating about a month after we met. Mark is my first 'serious' boyfriend. He makes me very happy and even though it's early in the relationship, I am excited to see where it leads, and he is very warm and understanding. I had never really felt a 'spark' toward a guy until I met Mark. 


I waited a little while to introduce Kevin to Mark, because I was afraid of Kevin's reaction. Whenever I went on a date in high school, Kevin would get really jealous, so I stopped talking about guys with him altogether. But I wanted Kevin and Mark to meet because I want them both in my life, and I hoped if he saw me happy, Kevin would finally get over whatever feelings he had for me. I told Mark that Kevin had/has feelings for me, but I assured him that I did not feel the same way, and he trusted my word.

We all went out together (Kevin, myself, Mark, and a couple of other friends) after Mark and I became official, and it was just as I feared. Kevin hated Mark from the first moment they met. Mark tried his hardest to be friendly, and to engage Kevin in conversation, but Kevin was rude and standoffish the whole time. Even our other friends thought he was taking it too far. I had hoped he would at least give Mark a chance, since Mark was making an effort, but Kevin wasn't having it. 

Mark was upset, but I told him I would speak to Kevin about his behavior. I asked Kevin to try and be a little nicer to Mark, or at least meet him halfway, and Kevin promised to try.

Kevin didn't really try. He continued to treat Mark like he didn't exist, and would only invite me to hang out, but not Mark. One night, about a week ago, a group of us were out bowling, and Mark overheard Kevin saying some very rude things about him to one of our other friends. Mark confronted him, and things got heated. No punches were thrown, but I took Mark and we left shortly after. Mark apologized for making a scene, but I texted Kevin after we got home and I told him that I didn't appreciate how he was treating my boyfriend, and if he didn't stop, I wasn't going to hang out with him anymore.

Kevin asked me to meet with him the next day, alone, so we could talk about it. I met him at a coffee place, and he basically told me that he couldn't believe I was picking Mark over him. He ranted about how he'd always been there for me, how he's been by my side for years, waiting for me to feel the same way he does, and I basically stepped all over him for some random guy I've only known for half a year. He then told me what I've always suspected and dreaded; he's been in love with me for years and can't stand to see me with someone else.

I calmly reiterated that I have only ever considered him a friend, and have told him that before, and and he went off on a big tirade about how insensitive I am, parading my boyfriend around in front of him. He got really emotional and said that Mark will never understand me like he does, and I'm shallow and selfish for refusing to give him a chance to change my mind. And he accused me of leading him on all these years. 

I apologized to Kevin for ""leading him on"" (I really don't think I did, but if he felt that way, it was unintentional on my end) and told him that he would not be able to change my mind, because I'm with Mark, and even if I wasn't, that doesn't mean I would date him. He was pretty livid, and said that I can't have both him and Mark, and I would have to choose my friendship with him or my relationship with Mark. Then he stormed out of the coffee shop. It was the angriest I've ever seen him. Kevin was always a really sweet guy, but whenever Mark is around or mentioned he just gets really mad. 

I've had a few days to think about this. I don't want to give up my relationship with Mark. The relationship is young, but I'm happy, and we exchanged the ""love"" word about a month ago. I haven't known him nearly as long as I've known Kevin, but my feelings for him are strong, and I don't want to give them up.

I told Mark about Kevin's ultimatum, and he was angry about it. He said I shouldn't have to choose, and told me he thinks Kevin is being totally irrational. I hoped Kevin would cool down, but he hasn't texted me since we met up, except one message that said, ""You make up your mind yet?""

I've been friends with Kevin for thirteen years and I don't want to throw our friendship away. He's never acted this irrational before. However, I know if we stay friends, he might not be able to get over his feelings, and I don't want to give him any ""false hope"" about us ending up together someday. I also think he's being a total jerk-butt about everything. 

I'm going to pick Mark; I don't have any qualms about it. I know I need to cut Kevin out of my life. Mark would never make me choose like this, and I don't even recognize Kevin anymore from the way he's acting. 

But what do I say to Kevin? I'm worried about him, and don't want to hurt him any more than I already have. I feel terrible about everything and hate that Mark got tied up in all this drama, because he didn't even do anything. Kevin was really angry when we met up to talk, and I don't even know if I should meet with him again in person, especially alone. How do I end a thirteen year friendship?

Any advice?

tl;dr: Childhood best friend is pissed at me for having a boyfriend. Confessed his love for me and is now asking me to pick between him and my boyfriend. Don't know how to end a thirteen year friendship.

> Kevin sounds like a textbook ""nice guy"".

> I know you don't want to lose him, but he's not your friend. He believes he is *entitled* to you romantically because he has been nice to you. This is not a good friend to have.

**OOP**

>>I've heard of ""nice guys"" but never really thought of Kevin as one before now. Again, this is the first time he's overtly acted like THIS. But thanks for giving me this perspective, it really helps. 

**[deleted]**

>>> I've known my male best friend for years and years too. No attraction on either side. Purely friends. When I bring boyfriends round you know what he does? Nothing.
>>>
>>> And I mean nothing out of the ordinary. He's as friendly to them as he is me, laughs and jokes with them, asks after them when he next sees me.
>>>
>>> That's how a true platonic friendship is. Kevin is just waiting around for you and it's never going to happen. Ditch him and go be happy with your new boyfriend. You won't be losing a friend, you'll be losing a creep who's in love with you and can't accept you're not in love with him.

**OOP adds a little more in the comments**

> Mark isn't pissed at ME, he's pissed about the situation in general. I told him about Kevin's feelings for me right at the beginning - at that point, I didn't know how intense Kevin's feelings were, or even if he still had them, since I'd already turned him down years ago. Perhaps I wasn't clear on that, for which I apologize. 
>
> But yes, I realize that I need to end the relationship with Kevin because it isn't fair to anyone, and I was stupidly idealistic for thinking they could get along. 
>
> EDIT: Mark also originally said he would make an effort to get along with Kevin because Kevin was my best friend for thirteen years. He never asked me to cut ties with Kevin, even though that is what I am GOING to do. 

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/NcS0144biK)  **June 3, 2015 (9 days later)**

Wow, I did not expect so much feedback on the post I made about a week and a half ago, sorry if the formatting is screwed up: [Original](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/377nj5/i_18f_am_in_an_awkward_position_with_my_childhood/)

I knew the choice I was going to make before I made the post, but it was really gratifying, in a way, to see so many people support that decision, and give some insight. I really appreciate it! So many of you were very helpful!

Some things I did not go into detail about in the original post is my social life/friendships. I did mention I am not an emotional person, but what I probably should have said is that I don’t easily form emotional attachments to people and have difficulty interacting with others. I don’t want to go into details, but my parents played a big role in that.  

Kevin is the only consistent friend I’ve ever had. My social life has improved considerably over the past couple of years, and especially in the months since I’ve been dating Mark. I’ve learned to open up to people more, and I am much happier, but for a while, when I was younger, Kevin was all I had. That’s why it was so hard to come to the decision to cut him from my life.

Anyway, about four days after I made the post, I texted Kevin and told him to meet me at the same coffee place we met at before so we could talk. I was scared to meet with him alone, so I brought Mark. It might not have been the best move, and several comments told me it was better to call or text or email, but I wanted to speak to him firmly, face-to-face, so he could see how serious I was, and Mark wanted to be there in case Kevin got angry with me. He sat in a corner with a book and monitored the situation from a distance, so he could step in if necessary.
 
Prior to our meeting, I let several of our mutual friends know of the situation. Most of them were very understanding. Some were already aware, because Kevin had spoken to them. I gave them my side of things, so they at least could understand where both of us were coming from. I didn’t ask them to choose sides, I just wanted both sides to be out there. I have received a significant amount of support from them, though a couple of them seem to think I am being a “bitch,” but whatever, I’ve been called worse. Many of my friends really like Mark and have become his friends too, so I am glad that they are being understanding about this, for the most part. 

When Kevin and I met up, I said just what a lot of you recommended. I told him that I was not the one who was ending this friendship, HE was ending it by making me choose between him and being in a relationship with Mark. I told him a real friend wouldn’t do that to me, and if he really cared about me, he would be happy that I am in a relationship with someone I really care about. He said that a good friend wouldn’t ignore his feelings like I have and wouldn’t lead him on. I told him that he’s been ignoring my feelings as well, and reminded him that I told him early on that I did not have feelings for him. It was a lot of back and forth, and I reiterated to Kevin that even if I were not with Mark, I wasn’t going to date him. I then said that we needed space apart to reevaluate things, because being around one another was not good for either of us, and told him that I hoped he would find his own happiness. 

Kevin didn’t really respond well; he made a minor scene and stormed out of the coffee shop. He also called me some very not-nice names, which only reaffirmed that I made the right decision to cut him out of my life. This happened pretty quickly, and Kevin left before Mark could intervene. Mark and I left the shop soon after, and I haven’t heard from Kevin since, though he has been telling some of our mutual friends how terrible I am and what a bad friend I’ve been, so there’s that. I do not intend to contact him and will not be attending any of the same social events that he is. I have also blocked him on social media for the time being. 

I am very sad to lose my friendship with Kevin. If he is able to sort out his feelings, then I have hope we can reconnect in the future. But I do not think that will happen any time soon, and will be moving on with my life and will continue on in my relationship with Mark.

I have also apologized to Mark for the whole situation, and he’s been great through it all. I’m really very lucky to have him. I have told him I will work on communicating better with him.

Anyway, Mark recently had a non-emergency issue with his family back home and asked me to go with him to visit his family and deal with the situation. I didn’t want to intrude, but he said he will feel better having me there with him to support him. We will be gone for a couple of months, out of the country, as his family lives in Europe. We leave this weekend, and, though it’s not an ideal situation, I am glad that there will be an entire ocean between Kevin and me, so hopefully he can start sorting out his issues.
 
Thank you again for all of your help! I might update again, if anything changes. 


   
TL;DR: Have put space between myself and my childhood best friend, Kevin, and he did not respond well. I am putting my best foot forward with my boyfriend, Mark, and have gone NC with Kevin so he can hopefully sort his feelings out.

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/SitSDk3EOh)  **Aug 12, 2015 (2 months later)**

After my first update, I got a lot of supportive comments, which I greatly appreciate. I also got a few nasty PMs calling me some pretty colorful names. Fortunately, I’ve seen every episode of Game of Thrones so I am desensitized to profane language and insults. 

On the other hand, the nice messages were lovely to read and I am grateful for the feedback. I'm sorry that I didn’t reply to most, but it’s been a busy couple of months. 

Someone also linked my OP and the first update to a different subreddit. I checked it out after someone mentioned it in the comments (or a PM) and I was surprised to see my posts there. But it did offer me some insight to look through the comments there, as well as the comments on my posts here.
 
After my last post, Mark and I went to Germany and stayed there from June until the last week of July. Once his family issues were resolved, we spent a lot of time together and I got to know his family. They were very welcoming, which was a huge relief, as I tend to come off a little cold when meeting people. We got along well and it was a very enjoyable trip. His parents want us to come back for the holidays, so that’s now in our plans. Mark and I have been together less than a year, but the trip strengthened our relationship, and reaffirmed that I want to be with him. 

While I was away, I had almost no contact with friends from home, other than occasional messages. I had no contact whatsoever with Kevin. I didn’t ask any of our friends about him, and they didn’t tell me anything. Even after I returned home, I did not inquire after him or communicate with him in any way, and most of my friends knew not to bring him up, and I assume they did the same with Kevin in regards to me. If I knew he would be at a social gathering, I did not attend. 

I’ve been planning to move to a new city (for education/career purposes) since last year and I’ve been scoping out places to live and employment opportunities for a while now. With help from a few friends I have in the area, those plans have come into fruition. Mark and I have discussed it extensively and he decided to make the move with me. His whole family is in Germany, and he doesn’t have any strong connections to our current city. We’ve lined up an apartment together, Mark has a couple of interviews, I have my ducks in a row, and we will be moving in about a week. I am so excited to begin this new chapter of my life with Mark, and I am confident in the future for both of us as individuals and together.  

This past weekend, a few of our friends threw a goodbye party for me and Mark at one of our favorite local hangouts. Though many of them were aware of the whole Kevin fiasco, he was invited to the event without my knowledge. I nearly panicked when he walked in the door.

He asked me if we could talk. He seemed very calm, so I consented. We stayed in the party area because I didn’t want to be alone with him.
 
Well, reddit, he apologized for everything he said, for badmouthing me to our mutual friends, for the ultimatum, for being a total jerk to Mark, and for not listening to me when I rejected him the first time. He said that going no contact was the best thing for him, because it helped him put everything in perspective. Then he said, and I’m NOT EVEN KIDDING, “I didn’t realize I was being a Nice Guy^TM.”
 
I forgave him, no waterworks or fanfare. I also apologized to him for possibly giving him mixed signals, as it was never my intention, and he said that after he had time to think about it, he realized that he had been ignoring my feelings and he should have respected my wishes in the first place. And we both agreed that our friendship could survive, but we would never be “best friends” again. We are going to be “friendly,” but he’s going to be a few hundred miles away now, which is good for everyone involved. 

Kevin told me that he is doing well, and has even gone on a couple of dates since our big falling out. He seems really hopeful about things, and I am happy for him. I do think he has moved on from Nice Guydom (I stole that from someone in the first update) and onto a better mindset. And I’m sure he will be very happy in the future once he finds the right girl. He wasn’t always the too-intense male personification of Taylor Swift’s “You Belong With Me” song. 

When we were done talking, Kevin spoke to Mark. I don’t know the details of that conversation, but they shook hands and Mark told me that Kevin apologized to him. They’ll never be bros or anything, but as long as neither tries to kill the other when they’re in the same room, I consider it a victory. 

 Some of my mutual friends have also apologized to me for calling me names during this whole situation and listening to Kevin’s badmouthing. I’m pretty much over it; no point holding grudges now when Mark and I are moving onto a new chapter in our lives, and Kevin is starting his own.

A lot of posters commented that I am lucky to have a guy like Mark. He’s dealt with everything very well, and I couldn’t ask for a more supportive boyfriend. And I mentioned it last time, but yes, I have apologized to Mark for unintentionally dragging him into this drama. He said that he is just glad it has been resolved, and he appreciates that I told him everything from the get go. 

I hope no one has to deal with a “Kevin” in the same way I did, but if anyone else out there does have a situation like this, I hope your “Kevin” or “Kevinette” comes around and the situation is resolved. 

For those of you who sent me hateful messages, I cannot imagine how cumbersome it is to carry so much spite and vitriol for someone you’ve never met. I hope you someday learn to channel your bitterness in more effective ways, and can find a more productive outlet for your anger, apart from anonymously cussing out teenage girls on the internet. 

Thank you all for your advice and insight over my last two posts. I am very grateful!
 
**TL;DR**: Kevin apologized. We are now cordial. I am moving to a new city with Mark, our relationship is going strong, and we are all starting new chapters in our lives.

I don’t know really where to start this. We met in February this year on a ski trip, and he invited me to his birthday party. I remember in the car him and his best friend were talking about relationships and when they asked about me, I said I think romance is propaganda. We would see each other here and there and social situations like board game nights and other events, he even hosted a dinner party where he invited me. Things picked up as we texted and we started having sex in May. The sex was so good and I enjoyed our company and our dynamics together. I loved learning from him as he’s a walking encyclopedia to ask questions. He would often invite me to things (trivia, karoke, watchparties, coffee after sex), but I would say no in fear the attachment. We did a couple of times though like waterfront walks and I invited him to my friend’s event. We always acknowledged the fun would have to end. He had surgery in September which was a tough month and being on medical leave I saw him at some of his worst, which I anticipated. I felt like his girlfriend when I visited him and did a little of caretaking but I told him even if I wasn’t the one I’m still grateful to be here in this moment. The week before my birthday I abruptly crash out and say we should stop, but we both end up overwhelmed by our emotions as he says he doesn’t want to lose a friend and we see each other again. Then he asks me about dinner on a saturday night, but is vague about so I think it’s a date but it’s more meant to be a serious conversation about the sustainability of us. He expresses how we reverted to old habits and wanted to be more intentional, and that he tends to hold things in which can hurt people. He talks about how relationships he’s seen from his friends are the merging of two lives falling in unison together (but it’s never like he gave me a chance to do this. Maybe he thought I valued my freedom and independence too much in how I lead my own life). I acknowledge it but we still keep texting that week. He hosts a small dinner party on Friday night (that he didn’t invite me to) and then the next night I ask if I can bring leftover bread pudding. We have sex again and the morning of I confront him about what he truly wants considering I thought he wanted to break up a week ago but then wanted me the night before. I ask him if he wants this to be our last time and he says no. I ask more questions and then he says he also shares the sentiment of liking each other and caring for me, but doesn’t have feelings for me like I do. I ask him why he was still texting me and he says he was weak. In my head I wish he was assertive. I say I don’t want to be a dog following him around and I need dignity, and I need to put my foot down in no texting. Our last interaction here really upsets me because he basically keeps hugging me tightly and pouts saying he’s sorry…and it just makes me feel pathetic like he pities me. It’s been 2 weeks since and we’re still in no contact but he still shares his location with me. He may or may not attend a friend’s birthday party this upcoming Saturday and I’m nervous about seeing him in public. 

I’ve never dated before and I’m not sure if I would call this love but it definitely hurts like heartbreak. It might be withdrawals like his gentle affection and check-ins but I really liked a lot about him. I solo traveled during Thanksgiving and I know it wouldn’t solve many problems, but coming back to the city, it feels like a pendulum where my emotions keep swinging. I thought changing beds like dog sitting and being in hostels would help.  

I guess I entered the friends with benefits because I knew it would always be safe because of our age gap that it would never be logical to date. I was much more thinking with my brain before but then my heart fell in. His care sent me mixed signals because he got me a rice cooker for my bday when I burnt my rice and kind of acted like my boyfriend during my bday party. He remembered what sweater I wore the night he hosted a smores gathering. He kept my sticky note (in cursive which he can’t read), my tooth brush in his bathroom, let me borrow his clothes, calmed me down, asked me for advice, shared his troubles…amongst other things. How do I know if I’m emotionally mature to be friends when it’s unrequited?",1,1764478808.0,AstroSynastry,0,1.0,False

I’m a total beginner, definitely do more huffing and puffing than actual sprinting right now. I'm just looking for a running buddy who is also starting out or just doesn't mind a slower pace.
Not really looking for a serious athletic club or anything intense, just someone to keep me accountable and chat with while we jog/walk around the lake or the neighborhood.

Let me know if anyone nearby is up for it? Chai/Coffee is on me after.

We have 2 kids, house, a successful business/careers, a lake lot and lots of other incredible things that have (or should) produce a meaningful and good quality life. The issue is that my partner finds being a parent and partner optional somehow. They have not gotten up with the kids in several years, has never packed a lunch for school, and rarely attends activities, functions, parties etc. 

I looked around our house a while ago and I couldn’t pick out a single thing that just belonged to me. I don’t have hobbies or interested because I can’t due to my partners  unreliability and I feel like an empty shell of a human. And it just hit me. I carry a lot of resentment and had this moment where I realized my partner doesn’t even know my coffee order. I find myself so disconnected and carrying a lot of anger and disbelief that this is my life and I don’t know how to function here anymore. They weren’t always like this but they have slowly stopped participating in life and it doesn’t seem to bother them. I’ve approached separating as part of me thought that would be best, but they were dumbfounded at the suggestion. Not an act- actually shocked I would even bring it up. 

I find myself on autopilot the last few months and am hoping somehow that things will improve despite knowing they won’t change. I just exist- it’s the kids and I, and then my partner. Like we live on 2 different islands. I pay all expenses outside the mortgage, and they don’t contribute to any of the household or mental loads. I as dumb as I probably sound for trying to make this work? Worse, am I just a parent to 3?

TL;DR

15 yrs, 2 kids, great life on paper, but I’m a single parent in a marriage. Partner checked out years ago (no parenting, no chores, no mental load). I’m resentful, empty, and done. Suggested separation and they were shocked. I know they won’t change, but I’m still here on autopilot. Am I an idiot for trying? ",4,1764478690.0,relationships,4,0.83,False

**Part 4**

I awoke in a room with light peeking through the bottom of the door. I could hear the faint sounds of familiar voices—distant chatter making its way towards me. I was in bed.

*Was it a dream?*

I get out of bed and look at my body. I couldn’t see the injuries. Not just the ones from that night, the ones prior as well. No broken bones, no scars. I was fine. I reach for the handle to open the door as the voices continue.

Opening the door, light rushes into the room filling the darkness. The rays of light pierce my retina. I put my arm up to my eyes, shielding it from the light. I moved my arm back down as my eyes began to adjust. Looking out I could see a rich oak bar with fancy liquors and wines. Around the bar there were many people, some with familiar faces and figures sitting and discussing various topics.

I saw my friend John among them. He was a bit shaken but tried to act as normally as he could. I saw the strange man at the bar as well, drinking what looked to be scotch. My eyes wandered until they fell upon a little brunette girl with a nice dress sitting at the bar. She quickly notices me and turns to speak.

“Look who’s finally awake.”

There were six people. John was on the far right. Following to the left of John was the brunette, then past the brunette was an older balding man facing towards the bar. Behind the bar is a short girl who looked familiar, playing with the tiny umbrella in her Shirley Temple. The strange man was sitting on the other side that ran perpendicular. Past the strange man, leaning against the wall, was a tall thin man with red hair and freckles.

The brunette girl continued to speak as some of the others looked over at me.

“I’m glad you decided to join us; we’ve been waiting for quite a while.”

I stood there confused as she went on.

“I’m sorry I broke your arm. It took longer than we’d thought for it to heal.”

I looked at her in silence. The thin red-headed man spoke up, “You’ve been asleep for a month.”

He must’ve noticed my worry, as he went to reassure me, “Relax, relax, you’re perfectly fine and healthy. We took care of you.”

I stood frozen.

The red-headed man spoke again, “You don’t have any burning questions for us? Of course you do. Isn’t it blatantly obvious what we are?”

 “Are you…. Vampires?”

They all laughed, all of them except for John. The bald man looks over at me after finishing off the last of his whiskey.

The strange man spoke, “Yes, we are vampires, I’m glad you’re at least smart enough to catch on to that.”

I’m starting to grow more concerned with each passing second. The group tries to reassure me that I’m safe. The red-headed man places a hand on my shoulder.

“Jeez, lighten up. It’s not so bad. It’s not like we’re the only ones.”

He moves to hand me a drink. I was hesitant, but I needed something to take the edge off.

The brunette girl spoke again as I finished off the last of the bourbon.

“John’s been awake for a few days. Sorry it took you so long, but I broke your arm pretty bad, it took longer than expected to heal.”

“What?” I questioned.

“You don’t remember? I snapped your left arm; it broke in two different places. There was blood everywhere. We almost thought you weren’t going to make it.”

I thought back to what happened when I broke my left arm. Stepping back, I spoke, “But your eyes.”

She looked over at me batting her eyelashes, “What about my eyes? Is there something wrong with my eyes?”

She laughed. “Don’t worry about it. They’ve healed up, they’re fine.”

The group went on to share a little about themselves. They drank, they partied, they did drugs. They traveled, spending eternity as they saw fit. They went on to explain that it’s not all fun and games, they do have enemies from time to time. People that hunt vampires, some loonies, some organized, others looking for revenge for lost relatives. Even though they are strong, they’re not invulnerable. They were recently attacked and lost one of their members. A strong man who served as a kind of protector. It was decided by the Alpha; the strange man, that instead of one replacement they’d have two replacements, and they said John and I fit what they were looking for.

Of course I had to ask, “Why me? What’s so special about me?”

The Alpha said, “We have a tendency to look for people that understand power. How to use it, how it can be abused. People that have had bad experiences, that know firsthand what can go wrong. We don’t want people running around like little gods that can’t be hurt.”

The Alpha had explained that he saw me fight back in the parking lot that night I was attacked. They were impressed by my decision to stay and fight. They also saw my emotional problems begin to develop and me seeking help to try and resolve them.

The reason they picked John was different. They watched John, a smart capable young man submit himself to the servitude of others that were absolutely unworthy of it. They saw him, also self-aware of his problems, seek out help to regain his sense of self-worth and control over his life through the support group.

After the Alpha had explained why he had recruited us, I suddenly realized why the short girl behind the bar looked familiar. She was the girl working behind the counter of the Sav-A-Lot.

After putting it together I ask, “How can she go out in daylight?”

The Alpha laughed, “Don’t worry about it, we’ll explain it later. That’s not too important right now. What is important right now is that she is the only one among us who can give you a gift.”

“A gift?”

“Well, we’re kind of a pack of sorts, we have our specialties. The person that was lost was our protector. It’s my duty to keep us out of trouble.” He pointed towards the red-headed man with freckles, “That man is our Thinker. He’s a hematologist, the smartest of the group.” He pointed again, this time to the brunette, “This is our seductress, our Dominatrix.”

He sighed after seeing the confusion in my face. “When all else fails you’d be surprised how far sex can go. Though we don’t need her often, she is quite useful when we do.”

I faced towards the old man. “What about him?”

“Ahh, that’s our Businessman. He’s the man with all the money, and all the power that makes this all possible. This is a basement with a bar, extra rooms and it’s completely locked down. Nobody can get in, and more importantly no sunlight can get in. We could stay here for months and years and all the bills are paid. This kind of thing isn’t easy to do on your own. We don’t dig holes, and we don’t sleep in coffins. We don’t play that game anymore thanks to him. He takes care of all that for us.”

The Alpha said that John and I were going to meet with the short girl behind the counter to receive our gifts. Out of everyone there, she puzzled me the most. She didn’t seem self-aware like the others or interested in anything in particular. She was lackadaisical as if she didn’t really even understand where she was or the gravity of what was going on.

I talked to John before we met with her to get a gauge of what he thought. He said that while he’s on edge, he believes we’re safe.

“They had every chance to kill us. If that’s what they wanted, they could’ve made it happen. I don’t think we got that bad of a deal. We’re alive after all.”

Before I could respond I saw the short girl approach John. She took him by the hand and led him into a separate room. After five minutes or so, I see them both come back out.

John sat back down next to me, and I asked him what happened. John’s eyes wandered before he spoke. “She just gave me a kiss and told me to be strong and protect the group.”

“That’s it?”

“Yea. That’s it.”

“Why?” I asked.

“I don’t know” he said, “I guess it’s some weird custom or something. Just try to play along.”

It wasn’t a satisfying answer, but that’s all John could really tell me. Not too long after, the girl walked up to me and led me into the same room. After closing the door, she began to speak.

Pulling me close she says, “I need you to be strong, protect me, and remember your true self.”

After talking she leans in, giving me a kiss. It wasn’t anything special or romantic. It felt platonic, like an awkward procedure you’d have at the doctor’s office.

As I step to leave, she holds me back. “I need you to make me a promise.”

“What promise?” I ask.                                   

“I need you to promise before I tell you.”

“Ok. I promise.”

“Tell the rest of the group that I only told you to be strong and protect me.”

As I open the door, I’m greeted by the Alpha. “So,” he says putting his arm around my shoulder. “What did she say?”

Trying to keep my composure I speak up, “She told me to be strong and protect her.”

He smiles. “Well,” he said, “I thought that was my job, but if she’s worried and needs another, that’s fine too. I just need you to do what you were told. Protect her and the group and everything will be fine.”

I began to relax as he seemed satisfied with my answer.

“One last piece of business to attend to,” he said. “To finally join the group, you need to drink a little blood.”

John and I were taken aback, we looked at each other for a moment.

“I don’t want to kill anybody,” I said.

“Oh, don’t worry, not like that.” The Alpha reaches back behind the bar grabbing out a glass wine bottle and uncorks it. “Don’t worry, we’re not barbarians.” He grabbed two glasses from behind the bar and set them on the counter pouring two drinks.

“Here we are,” he says handing us each a glass.

He could see me pause. He rolls his eyes. “It’s from a blood bank,” he said. “No one was harmed.”

I look at the glass, noticing its strong aroma filling the air like a fresh pot of coffee. It didn’t smell like blood. It smelled good, really good. I could feel my neck pulsating as I hesitated. The hairs on the back of my neck began to rise. My mouth ran dry. Before I could come to a decision, I looked over to see John with an empty glass in his hand. I hesitate for a moment and take a drink.",1,1764478415.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

He thought about going to see a doctor quite a few times, but decided against it and relied on over-the-counter medications. Medications that didn’t do jack squat to help. When he didn’t get any sleep, Morgan decided to use this time to work on things he had put off—a mini mountain of art projects, a TBR pile of manga, and house repairs. During the night, he would stay awake, and just a few hours before work, he would crash and sleep for about four and a half hours.

Morgan fought with his arm until he finally decided to get himself out of bed and to the bathroom for a much-needed shower. He got dressed and headed into work. Walking into the hospital towards the security room, his co-worker raised his head. “Well, look who the cat dragged in,” his co-worker Phil grinned, sipping on a cup of coffee. How many had he had so far? “Good morning, Phil.” Morgan stifled a yawn, and Phil made a face.

“Man, did you sleep at all?” his co-worker questioned. Morgan laughed, shrugged his shoulders, and took a seat.

“Enough to survive.” Phil sighed, shaking his head. “You need to see a doctor about that,” his co-worker said, taking one last look at the security camera screens before heading to the door. Morgan waved a hand over his shoulder, dismissing Phil, who left without another word. Even if it sounded a bit dismissive, he did care about the advice people gave him, but it had become second nature to him. That it no longer bothered him or was an extreme concern.

That night when Morgan arrived home he kicked his shoes off at the front door and made his way into his bedroom.

Getting dressed down for bed, he tossed the things from his pockets onto the dresser and pulled on a shirt and shorts, settling into bed with his phone. Checking his social media to wind down before trying to get some sleep. Noticing it had been a while since he posted something. He went to his photos. Scrolling through until he spotted a folder labeled *The* *Sleeper.*

When did he create this?

Morgan scratched his head in confusion…what the hell is *The Sleeper*? Had one of his friends do this as a prank? Curious, he taps on it to see what random mismatch of photos were in this. A bunch of spinning circles finally load to dozens of photos taken of himself when he was asleep. What the actual fuck?!

Could it be possible that his phone camera was hacked? Shaking his head, he presses a button on the side of his phone to close the screen. Before he tossed it onto the bedside table and turned out the lamp. Getting under the covers and decided to just worry about this tomorrow. Maybe in his free time, he should get a few security cameras and set them up.

If his friends were doing this, then he would need evidence to confront them. If it was someone else, then they were breaking into his home unnoticed. Though, wouldn’t he have seen the signs or noticed if anything was out of place? Not unless they were really good at breaking in and slipping out without leaving a trace. The following day, while Morgan was out, he picked up some small home cameras and placed them throughout his house.

If there was in fact someone breaking into his home, either it be one of his friends or a stranger, Morgan would need the footage as proof that this was going on. Also, to prove that he was possibly not crazy. When he had a chance to look at some of the recordings, it would go to fuzzy grey static around 3:30 a.m. During one of those nights, Morgan awoke to a feeling of someone watching him.

As he turned over, blearily opening his eyes, he saw an inky figure above him. Face or lack of face, to be more exact, a few inches away from his. Swallowing thickly, he closed his eyes tighter and pulled the blanket up to his chin. What the hell was this thing? Where exactly did it come from?

He knew that this house wasn’t haunted, but there was definitely something supernatural going on. Morgan decided to show Phil his co-worker the video clip he had saved to his phone. Who thought it was some special effects that he had added to the others. In other words, Phil believed it to be fake and his story fabricated. Even his close friends thought the same when he sent them the clip through text message.

Why didn’t anyone believe him? Even now, when he checked his phone, there were new pictures. These ones were different from the others, though. There were of himself smiling towards the camera, his eyes solid black. A shiver went down his spine as he tried to recall when he did that.

That night, Morgan decided to stay up until 3:30 AM the time that the inky shadow itself had shown up. That time, he had woken up in the middle of the night because he felt someone watching him. Sitting up in bed, he flipped through TV channels, passing the time. It wasn’t too long before time drew closer, the room growing cold, and his phone camera made the capture click noise. Picking it up, he looked towards the direction it had flashed, seeing… himself.

His… no, the doppelgänger’s eyes were wide and unblinking. Morgan stood ready to confront them when he became light-headed and fell to the floor. When he woke up, he frantically began searching for his phone that he dropped when passing out. Morgan raised his head, looking at the wall in front of him to see a crudely drawn picture of himself on the wall in some type of black substance. Above it was written in blood, “ *I am watching,”* and just above him stood the inky figure looking down at him. 

Phil looked at the clock seeing it was past time for Morgan to be at work. It wasn’t like him to be late or not call if there was an emergency. He sent him and text and tried to call but didn’t get an answer. Phil scrolled through his phone to see if he had any contacts that could go check on Morgan. When he noticed a folder on its home screen labeled *The Sleeper.*

Looking at what was inside the folder it only contained a single item…a glitchy photo of Morgan and a tall inky figure.",1,1764478056.0,RedditHorrorStories,0,1.0,False

Then he asks me about dinner on a saturday night, but is vague about so I think it’s a date but it’s more meant to be a serious conversation about the sustainability of us. He expresses how we reverted to old habits and wanted to be more intentional, and that he tends to hold things in which can hurt people. He talks about how relationships he’s seen from his friends are the merging of two lives falling in unison together (but it’s never like he gave me a chance to do this. Maybe he thought I valued my freedom and independence too much in how I lead my own life). I acknowledge it but we still keep texting that week. He hosts a small dinner party on Friday night (that he didn’t invite me to) and then the next night I ask if I can bring leftover bread pudding. We have sex again and the morning of I confront him about what he truly wants considering I thought he wanted to break up a week ago but then wanted me the night before. I ask him if he wants this to be our last time and he says no. I ask more questions and then he says he also shares the sentiment of liking each other and caring for me, but doesn’t have feelings for me like I do. I ask him why he was still texting me and he says he was weak. In my head I wish he was assertive. I say I don’t want to be a dog following him around and I need dignity, and I need to put my foot down in no texting. Our last interaction here really upsets me because he basically keeps hugging me tightly and pouts saying he’s sorry…and it just makes me feel pathetic like he pities me. It’s been 2 weeks since and we’re still in no contact but he still shares his location with me. He may or may not attend a friend’s birthday party this upcoming Saturday and I’m nervous about seeing him in public. 

I’ve never dated before and I’m not sure if I would call this love but it definitely hurts like heartbreak. It might be withdrawals like his gentle affection and check-ins but I really liked a lot about him. I solo traveled during Thanksgiving and I know it wouldn’t solve many problems, but coming back to the city, it feels like a pendulum where my emotions keep swinging. I thought changing beds like dog sitting and being in hostels would help.  

I guess I entered the friends with benefits because I knew it would always be safe because of our age gap that it would never be logical to date. I was much more thinking with my brain before but then my heart fell in. His care sent me mixed signals because he got me a rice cooker for my bday when I burnt my rice and kind of acted like my boyfriend during my bday party. He remembered what sweater I wore the night he hosted a smores gathering. He kept my sticky note (in cursive which he can’t read), my tooth brush in his bathroom, let me borrow his clothes, calmed me down, asked me for advice, shared his troubles…amongst other things. How do I know if I’m emotionally mature to be friends when it’s unrequited?",1,1764477951.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False
1pa9g9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/2under2/comments/1pa9g9w/starting_to_see_the_light/,Starting to see the light,"A little less than a year ago, I joined this group. I was deep in the trenches. I had a newborn and a 15 mo son. I joined the group because I needed some sort of community that is going through life with two under two. One post that I remember in particular was about life with two under two as they got older and feeling like they are out of the trenches. It was extremely encouraging and extremely positive. Reading it at that moment was sweet, but in my mind, it was never going to happen for me. Here I am now. My daughter just turned one last week. My son is now almost 2 1/2. I am finally here to say I am starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Am I still stressed? Overwhelmed? On edge? Tired? Yep! But it’s manageable. The routines are getting easier. My son isn’t jealous anymore. My daughter likes to be around her big brother. My son is trying to play with her more. Overall, I’m seeing a beautiful bond being created and it just makes everything I went through so much more worth it. I am just now starting to get back to me in very small ways, but it’s progress. So I’m here to finally say if you are deep in the trenches, it DOES get better❤️. I’m sure there will be new chapters with new challenges to overcome, but I’ll cross that bridge when I get there. Just know you guys are super moms and you can do this. You’re already doing it. You are more amazing and more capable than you think. I would also like to thank coffee and wine…. It helps.🤣😅.

1pa9d17,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1pa9d17/advice_10_proven_psychological_tricks_to_make_any/,[Advice] 10 proven psychological tricks to make ANY girl find you insanely attractive,"Let’s be real. You’ve probably Googled ""how to get her to like you"" or binge-watched TikToks with cringy “alpha male” tricks that promise to make her fall for you in 10 minutes. Most of that stuff? Absolute junk. Feels like a mix of clickbait confidence hacks and manipulative behavior that never works long-term.

The truth is, attraction is psychological. It’s not about being taller, richer, or even “hotter.” Even the science backs this up. Attraction is largely emotional and subconscious. But very few people are teaching the real, evidence-based stuff that makes people bond, trust, and feel pulled toward you, and that’s what this post is about.

I compiled these 10 psychological attraction triggers from actual research in human behavior, expert dating psychology books, high-ranked podcasts, and interviews with leading behavioral scientists, not pickup artists. Think of this as your 2024 master manual to deeply shifting how people perceive you, especially women.

Let’s go.

1. Use the “Ben Franklin effect”: Ask her for small favors  
Studies show we like people more when we do things for them, not when they do things for us. This trick, backed by the psychological principle known as the “Ben Franklin Effect”, taps into cognitive dissonance. If she does a favor for you (like lending a pen or helping with something small), her brain starts telling her, “Hey, I must like this person if I’m helping them.” It’s subtle but powerful.

2. Show vulnerability, but not too soon  
According to Dr. Brene Brown and multiple relationship studies, people are drawn to those who are real, not perfect. Sharing a small insecurity or failure (in a self-aware way) increases trust and intimacy. But timing matters. Oversharing too early can come off as emotional dumping. Vulnerability works best when rapport is already being built.

3. Master the 3-second eye contact rule  
One of the strongest non-verbal indicators of confidence is warm, brief eye contact. Clinical psychologist Dr. Paul Ekman’s research on facial expressions shows eye contact of around 3 seconds, paired with a slight smile and relaxed demeanor, sparks emotional response. Too long feels intense. Too short feels indifferent.

4. Use mirroring to create subconscious trust  
This one’s straight out of FBI negotiation playbooks. When you subtly mirror someone’s posture, tone, or even speech tempo, it activates a phenomenon called limbic synchrony. According to Professor Tanya Chartrand’s research at Duke University, we unconsciously trust and like people who reflect our behavior. Keep it subtle and natural, not robotic mimicking.

5. Leave “open loops” when telling stories  
Want to be memorable in her mind? Use the Zeigarnik Effect, humans remember unfinished tasks better than completed ones. When you tell a story, tease the best part. “Remind me to tell you how I got kicked out of a wedding once” creates curiosity. Now she wants to hear more. The brain loves suspense.

6. Talk less. Listen smarter  
According to the “liking gap” study published in Psychological Science, people consistently underestimate how much others enjoy their company during conversations. The secret? Ask high-quality, emotionally intelligent questions (e.g., “What’s your favorite way to spend Sundays?” or “What’s something you’ve always wanted to do but haven’t yet?”). People love talking about themselves. Make them feel heard.

7. Use scarcity psychology like a pro  
Scarcity breeds value. Behavioral economist Dan Ariely’s research shows that people are more attracted to what feels limited. If your availability is too unlimited, interest fades. A subtle ""I’d love to hang out, I’ve just got a packed couple days"" sends the right message: you’re not desperate. You have a life. That’s sexy.

8. Highlight internal confidence, not surface bravado  
Confidence isn’t loud. The most attractive kind is quiet self-assurance. Dr. David Buss, evolutionary psychologist and author of The Evolution of Desire, found women consistently ranked self-confidence and ambition higher than flashier traits. Focus on showing purpose, direction, and emotional control over trying to flex or impress.

9. Use “shared vulnerability” environments  
Want to shortcut connection? Go do something that raises adrenaline, even mildly. Research from the University of British Columbia shows that shared highs (like dancing, trivia night, or kayaking) increase feelings of romantic connection due to the misattribution of arousal. In simple terms, her body thinks it’s you that’s exciting.

10. Be emotionally unpredictable (but safe)  
This doesn’t mean being toxic. It means avoiding being emotionally flat. Relationship expert Matthew Hussey calls this ""emotional variety."" One moment you’re thoughtful and deep, the next you're playfully teasing. This contrast stimulates the dopamine system in the brain, keeping you interesting. But always create emotional safety. Be unpredictable, not unstable.

Now, if you're serious about building long-term attraction, not just surface-level flirting, there are epic resources you need to absorb. These aren’t pick-up books. They’re backed by decades of psychological insight, and they’ll change the way you see attraction forever.

1. Models by Mark Manson  
This book will make you question everything you know about dating. Seriously. It’s the most brutally honest, no-manipulation, self-improvement-driven dating advice you’ll find. Manson dismantles shallow tactics and focuses on becoming a high-value person from the inside out. Best dating book for anyone who’s sick of pretending to be someone they’re not.

2. Attached by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller  
NYT bestseller + written by a psychiatrist and neuroscientist. This book unpacks attachment theory in relationships and explains why we chase unavailability or sabotage connection. Every insight hit me like a truck. This is the best book if you want to understand emotional intimacy, text dynamics, and why some girls seem to disappear after it’s “going well.”

3. The Art of Charm Podcast  
This long-running podcast has interviewed experts like Dr. Robert Cialdini, Joe Navarro, and Vanessa Van Edwards about charisma, social intelligence, and body language. It’s like an audio masterclass for becoming someone who naturally captivates others.

4. The Psychology of Attractiveness by Dr. Rob Burriss (YouTube)  
Short, evidence-based, non-cringe videos on why we find people attractive. It’s hosted by a real evolutionary psychologist and dives into topics like facial symmetry, voice pitch, and status cues without feeling academic.

5. Love Factually by Dr. Duana Welch  
Think of this as the science-based dating manual for the modern age. Welch compiles decades of peer-reviewed research on what makes love last and how to find someone who truly fits you, and it’s written in a super accessible, funny tone. Best book to build long-term success, not just flings.

6. BeFreed (app)  
BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that generates personalized, podcast-style lessons from top books, expert interviews, and research papers, based on your goals and interests. I use it to dive deep into dating psychology, relationship dynamics, and social behavior, way beyond the surface-level TikTok fluff. You can adjust the depth, voice, and even pause mid-lesson to ask follow-up questions. It’s built by ex-Google AI experts and Columbia alumni, and honestly, it helped me connect the dots on why certain patterns keep happening in my dating life. Highly recommend if you're serious about leveling up your mindset.

7. Dating apps: Hinge and Coffee Meets Bagel  
Hinge has voice note features, thoughtful questions, and algorithmic matching based on deep preferences. Way better for authentic connections than swipe-heavy apps. Coffee Meets Bagel gives daily curated matches, forces reflection, not mindless swiping.

8. Texting tool: the app “Charm”  
Charm is an AI-powered texting assistant that helps you craft better flirty responses and understand tone analysis. It uses behavioral psychology prompts and feedback loops to help you text with more confidence and clarity, without being weird.

9. Mindset training: “How To Talk To Girls” by Case Kenny (podcast)  
Case’s entire vibe is about being mindful, respectful, and building internal value. His podcast is great for reframing dating anxiety and rejection into fuel for growth.

All of this boils down to one truth: Attraction isn’t something you chase. It’s something you amplify by being real, centered, and emotionally intelligent. Most guys are playing checkers. These tools let you play chess.",12,1764477571.0,OdysseyBookClub,1,0.88,False

To start things off I am 37 weeks pregnant with my first child. We live together in a bought house and are over 5 years together.

We were looking at videos on his phone and I asked him to send me one (recipe to try another time). When he went to share, there was a woman I didn’t know as the first option. Now I have previously been cheated on, so alarm bells went off straight away, but in my pregnancy hormone filled brain, I didn’t confront him there and then, I decided to do some digging.

Well, I couldn’t get into his FB but did manage to come across his insta messages. One night within the last month he messaged a bunch of porn stars while drunk. Embarrassing but not something I would leave over, just a boundary / respect thing.

However, I came across a message back in January of this other woman that he knows personally. The main points were:
“Come sit on my face”
She says “you only text me when you’re drunk” (important as no other conversation above this was visible)
They plan to meet up for coffee on his suggestion
They laugh about doing it in the toilets and he says “I’ll hold you to it”
Among other flirty messages

I confronted him that night and he apologised profusely, said it was one time while he was drinking alone and horny and meant nothing and that they never actually met up. He had no other messages from her and had actually unfollowed her as a friend after.

We have made boundaries like
No more drinking alone
I get access to his phone from now on if I ever feel the need to see something, rather than snooping

With the fact it was one time, he seems genuinely remorseful, and willing to work on rebuilding the trust, should I stay and try too?

I would like to point out if I wasn’t this far along in the pregnancy I’d be out the door without another word, which is why I need advice - am I staying for a valid reason or am I vulnerable atm and staying out of fear, I truly don’t know.

I do not want to talk to my support network as I know they would say get out of there and if I do decide to stay, I can imagine they will see me as weak/foolish.  

As it was only texting and he’s being receptive to it, answering all my questions honestly and allowing me space when I need it, do you think we can move past this?

1pa92s0,https://i.redd.it/0pv7z6izmb4g1.png,Static In the Storm,"I’ve never been the type to believe in the paranormal. Ghosts, spirits, monsters ...none of that ever made sense to me. I was always the “I’ll believe it when I see it” kind of guy. Same with religion. I didn’t hate it; I just never saw a reason to think any of it was real.

That changed last night.

I live in the West End district of Shadow Falls, and I usually go jogging around midnight. It’s quiet, the streets are empty, and it’s the one time of day I feel like I can think. Last night it was raining, but only lightly at first. I almost stayed home, but I convinced myself a little rain wasn’t a big deal.

So, I put on my raincoat, tied my shoes, and headed out.

About fifteen minutes into my jog, the rain got worse. Much worse. It went from annoying to overwhelming in a matter of seconds. The thunder started up, too ... it was loud enough to make me jump once or twice. I kept going anyway, but by the time I hit Ninth Street, the rain was so heavy I could barely see what was in front of me.

There’s a small diner a few blocks from my place, and I figured I’d duck in there until the storm calmed down. I was already soaked, and the idea of standing under a roof sounded good enough. The only problem was crossing the street to get there.

I tried to look both ways, but with how hard it was pouring, I couldn’t see any headlights. It was after midnight, and the roads are usually dead around that time, so I figured the chance of a car coming was pretty low.

I stepped into the street.

That’s when a van came out of nowhere, speeding straight toward me. I didn’t even have time to react. I remember the sound of the engine, the shape of the headlights, and the sudden realization that this was probably it for me.

But then something impossible happened.

I felt this sharp jolt, like a burst of electricity going through my whole body and suddenly the world around me shifted. I blinked once, maybe twice, and the next thing I knew I was standing safely on the sidewalk in front of the diner.

No pain, no impact, no explanation.

I turned back toward the street, confused and shaking, and that’s when I saw it. A figure standing where I had been only seconds earlier. It looked like a person, but its whole body was made of some kind of glowing energy. Bright, flickering, almost like it was made of electricity instead of skin and bone.

It didn’t move. It just watched me.

And then, just as fast as it appeared, it disappeared.

I went inside the diner and sat down. I ordered a coffee but didn’t drink it. I just sat there trying to understand what had happened. I must’ve stared at the wall for an hour.

I don’t know what that thing was.  
I don’t know how it saved me.

But after last night, I can say this much with confidence that there are things in this world I clearly don’t understand.",1,1764476660.0,u_strangeshadowstories,0,1.0,False

I noticed 2-3 hrs after brushing my teeth they would ache (healthy and filled teeth) and this phenomenon only occurs just before bed. I took prenatal because I heard it is good for woman menstrual health (I still identify as a 23yr. Child 👧 so no pregnancy is not in the works) and this teeth aching has diminished by 85%, but the teeth aching is still there. I noticed that massaging my gums does help a little bit. Is there a noninvasive solution to this phenomenon I experience? What could be the cause? I have no health conditions and I don’t smoke, drink, or do any drugs. I do drink coffee but limit to 2 cups a day and I eat sugar 1x a day and afterwards follow with water rinse and xylitol gum. ",1,1764476645.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

Only a few restaurants declined the reservation requests after reading the allergy details. But to be fair, if they explicitily called out that they couldn’t accomodate, I did not send a request. Hope my post helps others narrow down their options.

Yakitori

Torisaki (Kyoto) ✅
I snagged a cancellation a few days before arriving in Kyoto through Instagram and was able to fit it in because I had mixed up the dates of another reservation (it worked out perfectly). We were the only foreigners, and they were incredibly kind and welcoming. Every skewer was excellent, but the shoulder, neck, and gizzard were my personal favorites. This is definitely a place I will return to.

Ichimatsu (Osaka)❌
The worst meal of the trip. I was really looking forward to this after seeing it praised on this subreddit, but from the very first skewer it was clear the quality of the chicken did not compare to Torisaki, and it only declined from there. Many courses felt completely out of place for a yakitori restaurant, including ricotta, grated onion with bread, chocolate, and coffee. It felt more focused on filling you up and putting on a show for tourists than on highlighting the chicken itself. Everyone dining was a foreigner, and the chef mainly talked about wanting to open a location in NYC or LA.

Kaiseki

Higashiyama Tsukasa (Kyoto) ✅
My favorite kaiseki meal of the trip. This was the most fun experience, as it was a very creative interpretation of kaiseki. The chef explained every dish in English, and along with the younger team, created a warm and enjoyable atmosphere. Despite the relaxed environment, every detail from the ceramics to the presentation to the service was flawless. We were very impressed. There was only one seating, and we were the only foreigners. The wine and sake list was also excellent. I will definitely return in a different season.

Miyawaki (Kyoto)✅
We did Tsukasa and Miyawaki back to back. This was a more traditional kaiseki experience, and every course was delicious. The best piece of wagyu beef I had during the trip was here, sourced from the chef’s hometown in Kagawa where the cows diet include olives. And same for the Uni, I never got the hype until I tasted theirs, incredible! Unlike Tsukasa, the two seatings overlapped for about an hour, which made the service feel somewhat disorganized until the first group left. Most dish descriptions were presented on an iPad, but the chef and his wife were still very engaging. Every course was very very tasty!

Myoujyaku (Tokyo)✅
We secured a last-minute reservation in their private room. I had read about their exclusive use of seawater, but tasting it firsthand was incredible. The subtlety and tenderness of every ingredient really stood out. I loved having a printed menu to follow along and read in detail about the ingredients and the story behind each course. I think the experience would be even better at the counter, as service occasionally felt awkward in the private room.

Miyoshi (Kyoto)❌
Booked through TableAll and ended up being the most expensive meal of the trip. It was good, but not worth the price. I would not return.

Sushi

We visited Sushi Sho a week before this trip, and after that experience, the two sushiya we tried in Tokyo felt slightly below by comparison. Sho earned three Michelin stars while we were in Japan, and couldn’t be more deserving.

Mizukami (Tokyo)🟨
Frequently mentioned on this subreddit and one of the few sushiya willing to accommodate a shellfish allergy, which I truly appreciated. Mizukami-san served the single local diner along with a large group from Brazil, while the remaining four guests, including us, were served by his right-hand, Nesaki-san. I prefer a more acidic shari, and this was very well balanced. They provide an English menu and point to each item as it is served. This is minor nitpicking, but our chef’s nails were dirty, and his movements lacked some of the delicacy I look for when forming nigiri. That said, it was still a very good meal. I would consider returning for lunch.

Sushiya Hajime (Tokyo)🟨
We did Mizukami and Hajime back to back for easier comparison. The shari here was less acidic and used more wasabi, which at times overshadowed both the fish and the rice. Watching the chef prepare each course was a joy. There was very little English spoken, but they used an iPad to show the fish, sometimes with helpful names and other times with very literal translations. There was only one seating, with just us two foreigners and two local salarymen. The room was silent until the two men arrived and began talking to the chef, which I appreciated.

New Japanese

L’Effervescence (Tokyo)✅
I managed to snag a lunch reservation and was initially nervous, as Michelin stars in Japan can be hit or miss. This one delivered. While every course was good, what really stood out was the hospitality and service. Some tableside elements made the experience engaging rather than just a sequence of dishes. It felt like a thoughtful expression of modern Japanese cuisine with French influence. Despite its three stars, the atmosphere was relaxed rather than stuffy. I will definitely return and highly recommend it.

Ukiyo (Tokyo)✅
A favorite on this subreddit, and it absolutely lived up to expectations. Beautiful presentation, strong execution, and well-balanced flavors. This was the only place where I genuinely enjoyed shirako. The service team was a bit reserved at first, but once we asked for wine recommendations, they warmed up and became much more conversational. There were two stacked seatings at 7:00 and 7:30, and everyone dining was a foreigner. I will definitely return on a future trip and would love to compare it with Cocon.

Creative Dining Takayama (Kyoto)✅
They were very accommodating when I mixed up my reservation date and moved us from dinner to lunch. Everything was delicious, well executed, and beautifully presented, except for the fish course, which fell a bit short. The team was friendly and engaging, which was especially appreciated since there were only two parties dining, us and a father and daughter from Taiwan. This ended up being my partner’s favorite meal after Torisaki.

Hakunei (Tokyo)❌
Our first French-Japanese restaurant of the trip. From the moment you enter the book-lined lounge, it is clear the experience leans more French than Japanese. Unfortunately, most courses were misses rather than hits. My favorites were the mille-feuille and the barracuda rice, which came with onigiri to go. The ambiance felt somewhat uptight, and the service team was difficult to connect with. Only one seating, with just four of ten seats filled, all by foreigners.

Pizza

I enjoy trying good pizza wherever I travel, and Tokyo was no exception.

400 Degrees (Tokyo)✅
Despite the crust looking large and doughy, it was surprisingly light and enjoyable. I preferred this over Da Michele in Naples, as the crust held up better. Reservations sell out quickly once released. There are around 14 to 16 seats, and during our seating, we were the only foreigners.

Marumo (Tokyo)❌
We visited this before 400 Degrees and found it solid. We ordered the Japanese Umami pizza and enjoyed how the flavors came together. Plenty of seating and mostly foreign diners.

⸻

Others

Tonkatsu Fujii (Osaka)✅
Absolutely incredible and probably my favorite meal of the entire trip. I never thought tonkatsu could be anything more than deep-fried pork. We ordered the set menu based on their recommendation, as the menu was in Japanese. Every cut of pork was cooked perfectly, and the breading was almost imperceptible. All sauces and even the salt are house-made, including the best mustard I’ve ever had. I loved this place and cannot wait to return. Highly recommended if you’re in Osaka.

Yoroniku (Tokyo)❌
The chateaubriand sando initially caught my attention, but once a roll topped with caviar and gold flakes arrived, I knew this place was not for me. The meat itself was excellent, but at this price point I would rather have more high-quality beef and fewer luxury add-ons. Service quality varied by server, and other tables with foreigners seemed to receive more attentive explanations. I would not recommend it.

⸻

Food Tours

5am Ramen Tour (Tokyo)✅
Because of my shellfish allergy, we did this tour to avoid any miscommunication about broth and ingredients. It was an excellent experience with some great ramen spots in Ueno, and I highly recommend it. We would have done the Kyoto tour as well, but it didn’t fit our schedule.

Culinary Backstreets (Tokyo and Osaka)✅
This is my go-to food tour company worldwide. In Japan, they operate in Tokyo and Osaka. The Tokyo tour is set in the picturesque Kichijoji neighborhood, while the Osaka tour focuses on street food and market exploration. Reading reviews helps identify standout guides, and having a great guide truly elevates the experience. I enjoyed the Osaka tour more than the Tokyo one.

Wine Bars

Tokyo
The largest selection of Jura wines outside of Jura is at Gout de Jaune, a tiny bar near Akasaka. There are no walk-ins, but reservations can be made through Instagram DM (@shohei_miumiu1109). This is not a place to casually have a single glass, but rather to enjoy a bottle or two with food. Best suited for a relaxed, wine-focused evening.

Kyoto
Brun Wine Bar opened about three months ago and was a standout. Reservations can be made through Instagram DM (@brun_kyoto) and are currently easy to secure. A strong bottle selection paired with an extensive by-the-glass list. The owner was very friendly, and we enjoyed talking wine despite his limited English. The food and snacks were excellent. This was my favorite wine bar of the trip.

Osaka
Lupin is a fairly new “western food” wine bar or more like a tapas restaurant. Ran by husband and wife - he used to be at a spanish bbq restaurant in Kobe and she was the somm at a Michelin restaurant. We were in great hands so we ordered a charcuterie plate where all the cuts were made in house along a steak burger pattie. Wine pairings were excellent. Perfect for a night where you want a break from traditional japanese food. Reservations can be made through instagram DM (@lupin.episode0). Food menu is only in Japanese.

Breakfast and Coffee

Sharing my favorite breakfast and coffee spots. I am by no means a coffee connoisseur, so this is based purely on my taste for pour-overs and black americanos.

Onibus (Tokyo)
Good coffee, pastries only.

Trichromatic Coffee (Tokyo)
Great coffee with an excellent egg toast and outstanding banana and carrot cake. I visited twice and it was my favorite breakfast stop.

Tokyo Little House (Tokyo)
The best americano of the trip, paired with a very good cheese toast and cheesecake. Located near our hotel, so we visited multiple times. The hosts were extremely welcoming.

Roar Coffee (Tokyo)
Good coffee and the best banana cake I had on the trip. Ask for it warmed. Any location should be solid, as they have several across Tokyo.

Style Coffee (Kyoto)
The best pour-over I had during the trip. A tiny shop near the botanical garden, with a lovely walk there through independent shops.

Goodman Roaster (Kyoto)
Very good coffee and excellent banana cake. Plenty of seating for a slow morning. Cash only.

Weekenders Coffee (Kyoto)
Probably the most popular coffee shop in Kyoto, and the coffee lived up to the reputation. I had a single-origin pour-over that ranked just behind Style Coffee. Limited seating, with some outdoor options or coffee to go.

Glitch (Osaka)
I wanted to see what the hype was about, and the line here was shorter than in Tokyo. Good coffee and a fun atmosphere with vinyl records playing.

Lilo Coffee Roasters (Osaka)
A very small space with limited room to stand inside. The coffee was good, but I generally prefer a spot where I can sit or settle in while drinking.",16,1764476606.0,finedining,7,0.95,False
1pa91ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1pa91ur/when_is_it_appropriate_to_start_dating_after_a/,When is it appropriate to start dating after a breakup?,"Tl;dr…. Just the title. 

I’m 42F. I became a widow 6.5 years ago. In that time, I spent 2 yrs with a guy that I thought I loved, but it ended up a codependency situation where my life revolved around trying to “fix” him cuz he had DID. By the end, I just had no more love to give, so had to let him go. We remain friends. I had already known him a decade prior to the relationship. 

Then, I reconnected with a guy I had gone on a couple dates with back in 2009. We were together 16 months or so. I don’t think I ever was in love with him— I wanted to be I think cuz he had wanted to date me for a decade and maybe I thought it endearing (?) so just wanted to really love him. The moment I realized I wasn’t in love was when I dreaded having to kiss him goodbye the last weekend he left my house… it just seemed like kissing a friend. This life is too short for a lack of passion I think. 

Then, I decided to spend the next 18 months single— made friends, went out and had fun with them doing new hobbies, healed, therapy, etc. In all of my single time since my husband died, I’d prob gone on first sometimes second dates with 30 different men… I just never “felt” what I was looking for. 

Sixteen years ago, before I met my husband, there was a guy I dated for 4-6 months. I never forgot the passion we felt when our eyes and lips met. There was just magic about it. He felt it too, but he wanted different logistics so found someone else and married her. I was heartbroken. In all those guys that I met up with over the past 6 years, I found myself looking for what I felt when I was with that guy— I never could find it so…. I decided to message him out of the blue one day, 15 yrs after we had last seen each other. He happened to be just separated. Not the best timing to start dating and we were unsure if we would even feel the same. When we met up, we locked eyes and both of us still felt what we had all those years ago. I was over the moon— he was too, or at least I think so. Within the past 15 months, he has broken up with me 3x. The first 2x, I was devastated… crying, etc. begging him to try again. I was so scared to lose him and that passion again, I wouldn’t accept that he just wasn’t emotionally ready for a relationship, let alone one with someone who is ready to settle down and be a partner to someone. So this time, I finally realized, even though I did not want to let him go again…. He just isn’t ready. Having to reinvent your life after a long marriage has ended is heavy. I love him so much. Idk if he loves me anymore… he said it and acted like it up until the week he pulled the plug, but there was so much emotional unrest with us cuz I wanted more quality time with him and he needed solitude and healing. I need someone who can be with me a few days a week after a year together, he needs someone that can meet up occasionally and give him his space to grow alone…. Or, actually I guess he needs no one at all maybe. Either way… what we need at this point in our lives is vastly different. 

Anyway, last time we broke up… though I was devastated, I had a coffee date with someone a couple days later. He and I were still talking cuz it’s a hard habit to not talk with someone who has been your bff for months and that you love more than anyone. Especially when the break up seemed abrupt. He was very hurt that I started dating so soon cuz it made him feel like maybe I never cared for him at all, which was not the case. I only wanted him. But, for my own emotional health, I could not just sit at home crying or it would lead to depression probably— I need to be functional. So I just jumped back into the saddle though I hated to. I also did it so soon so that I would stop bugging him and just let go already. I went on a couple more first dates and I just felt nothing. I want to feel for these people what I feel for him— that is what I need and am looking for in a partner to settle down with. I don’t want to spend the next 16 years looking for him in people only to never find it again. 

So if a couple days after breaking up is too soon… when is it appropriate then? 

I think my perspective is different too cuz I saw first hand how short life is… all the things I thought I was going to do in this life with my husband died with him that day he collapsed. A copacetic life as we knew it gone in an instant. We could all die at any moment, so I don’t want to waste time NOT being with someone I’m passionately in love with nor alone. My husband was my best friend and I rather liked living with my bff everyday. And, now I’ve spent 5 years of my life with 3 different people and none I could settle down with…. So it just seems like kind of a waste of time that for me is far too precious. ",6,1764476575.0,emotionalintelligence,5,0.87,False
