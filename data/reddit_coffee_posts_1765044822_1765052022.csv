I have an oak veneer coffee table (veneer over MDF core) that had water damage from an oil diffuser. I tried to fix it by sanding the damaged area, but I went too deep and sanded right through the veneer layer. Now there's a white/light colored area where the MDF is showing through.

I've already applied water-based clear matt varnish over it, but the white area is still very visible. The clear varnish obviously doesn't hide the color difference.

**What I've done so far:**

* Sanded the damaged area (went through the veneer - rookie mistake)
* Applied water-based matt clear varnish

I'm pretty new to furniture repair, so detailed advice would be really appreciated. I've attached photos showing the original damage and the current state after sanding and varnishing.

Thanks in advance for any help!

Generally, I avoid drama at all costs, asking to do something that will harm someone, but in this case, I simply have to intervene. The player in the screenshot, nicknamed ""coffee"" by some (I don't know why, probably because of his previous nickname?), is ruining ranked matches by going AFK. What does it look like? The player plays until his team wins – all it takes is one missed round and he goes AFK and challenges his teammates in text chat. In the last two weeks, I've matched him four times, and each time he went AFK, resulting in our loss. Is there any way to get rid of him? I can't believe such extremely harmful behavior isn't being reported by others (I report him after every match). I also ask other players to actively participate in trying to ""neutralize"" this player.",1,1765051557.0,Strinova,2,0.6,False

I don't ruminate as much, my reaction to adversity and stress has definitely improved. Baseline mood elevated.

Now in my experience 1g of Tyrosine on an empty stomach hits me like a rocket. It makes me a bit jittery unless i take a quick nap and follow with some coffee. The effects are way better when i follow up by some exercice and a cold shower. That puts me in a sweet spot with improved motivation, focus, sociability, concentration and everything i want it to be. The general mood carry out into the next day as well. However if i don't work out the effects are by far less enjoyable. Zero tolerance so far.

Interviewer: They are one of the most popular quebec bands in the world, hundreds of millions of streams across streaming platforms, never-ending tours here, in the USA, in Europe, in Asia, in South America. They played at the biggest world festivals, —lollapalooza, Coachella, Primavera sound—, in a decade, they did about 400 shows, Tyler the Creator is a fan of theirs, they opened for Billie Eilish, and all that while being independent and, almost seemingly avoiding the medias, it's very impressive, I'm welcoming the singer of Men I Trust Emmanuelle Proulx

Emma: early morning~ it's 11am for me it's still morning [laughs]

I : Its still morning, officially, so you are allowed

E : [laughs] ok cool!
I: Thank you for visiting, its the first time we meet!

E: Yes!

I: I was going through your resume because it's true, it's an incredible success, and all of that doing it your own way. Do you have an explanation for this? Is it actually your process that made you successful?

E: at first it wasn't by choice, because like everybody we didn’t have the funds and we wanted help from ? (grants) And the music in quebec at the time 10 years ago, people just weren’t interested by what we had to offer, but we were hungry and eager, so we learnt to make everything by ourselves, be it videos, we studied online platforms like how to release our music ourselves, and progressively our hyper independency became useful to us and, exactly, by the time people got interested in us, we had our system and we became comfortable with it and it became something we didn’t want to lose because it allowed us especially to stay close to the making/creation you know, like to create something and to release it immediately, to have something that just came out of the oven, fresh and close to our hearts and our minds, and to share it immediately, that's one of the reasons why we do it this way still today. Like we tried stuff, and we figured things out by ourselves without any exterior influence and we just kept doing things like this.

I: Yes and so it allows you to keep things close to your heart, and you tour a lot in 2026
Do you have the impression that you are living on the run? [Laughs]

E: Yes but it became our regular life, it's like a balance, when I go on tour, I mean me, the guys (?), but personally I don't check when I come back, sometimes I don't know where I go the next day, it's just like ""well my new life is to be on the road!"" And we have a tight system, well like the first few tours were very rock n roll like 4 of us slept in a two people room, then everything was difficult but now we have a very comfortable system, the gang is perfect, we have a very small group very close, everybody works very hard but when I stay home for too long I just want to go back (on tour) its very like that. 

I: so it's like the life at home is exceptional (unusual)

E: exact, but I mean, two years ago I laughed because I was at the pharmacy and the girl was like ""do you want to fill a form to win a coupon for a trip?"" I was like ""NO I DON'T WANT TO"" 

I: [laughs] like ""When I am on holidays I want to stay home""

E: But when the gang parted two weeks ago, we already know that in january we would be excited to go back on tour.

I: does it ever happen to you not to know where you are?

E: it doesn't! you know when you were young and you were not used to sleeping away from home, you would go to sleep and you would wake up in the middle of the night not knowing where you are, but now my body is used to sleeping in different places every night so I am not confused anymore at night, and I sleep in a lot of different places now. [Laughs]

I: is there a place where you remember, maybe it was the crowd or the show context that was the most impressive you ever lived, one show that really impacted you?

E: I would say well, it's more like milestones, it's gradual, like when you play the first time in a specific venue and you're like ""oh my god I can't believe we are playing here"" and then slowly but surely, the crowds get bigger like, I know we did a show for a crowd close to 10000 fans at the start of the summer, in Brooklyn, I was very happy... my god, one show specifically? Montreal Jazz Fest it had been such a pleasure to be at home, in front of so many people who waited under the rain, we weren't sure if the show would even happen, then having such a crowd at home, at the place des festivals, a place we don't often play, I think we never did it outdoors, and the fact that it was so full, it really made us happy.

I: We are now going to listen to one of your first big success.
[Show me How]

I believe it's a song that has 750 millions of listens, and that only on Spotify thats what I saw.
The country you played the most with MIT Emmanuelle is the US, you toured a lot there, I assume you also experienced that evolution recently between US and Canada, its not going well, do you feel a difference when you have to go tour in the USA recently?

E: yes in the paperwork, I believe there are some complications, with the passport, for instance what I remember the most, everywhere in the world, in the USA, in Japan, music is like a shield, it's like a moment where everything stops and everyone shares common values, it's like a sanctuary safe from everything that's happening around, and we feel so privileged of being at the forefront of that, in a world where everything is interactive but where there's no more human contact, the shows have even more meaning, to have so many people reunited together to live the same thing, for one hour and a half, like I would say, in our venues, I don't feel it (the things happening in the world), I see young people who love music, who are curious, who are nice, we have fans who are 18 to 40 it's extraordinary, as many boys as girls, it's such a treasure and we feel so lucky to have fans who look like us, so I don't feel it, or maybe a superior need for love or to escape 

I: we talked abt it earlier but in Quebec, there's not a lot of media coverage abt MIT, you don't give a lot of interviews. Do you think its the language barrier because you sing in English?

E: well for sure in quebec theres a system that encourages French language it's something extraordinary, I applaud all the initiatives for that, French is my mother tongue, it's close to me, I grew up with Celine (Dion) and Daniel Bélanger (?) So it's just, by choosing to use english, we are going through another system that went progressively, we explored the internet boom, to have a big audience, and then it’s like having two paths, one going to the left, one to the right, there's not one good answer, we decided to take the way on the right and it worked well for us so thats it, but you know it’s funny to do a show in montreal and im like (part in quebec french that i am not sure about 😂) ""Hello The gang! Wow there are so many quebecois [laughs]"" we are so stupid [laughs]

I: you opened for an artist who doesn’t need any introduction anymore 
[Playing bad guy from billie eilish]

You opened for billie eilish in november, so very recent, how was it?

E: it was surreal, in this field we do a lot of shows it can almost become ""banal"", but here we really got a wow moment, the production was amazing, the (?) Of this artist, we started the tour being fans but now, I speak for myself and my team, but like the lights? my light guy had his jaw on the floor, the whole production, I am speechless, but really it was an extraordinary experience for us, we had dates already planned for Florida so we couldn't do the whole tour with her, so we were heartbroken to part, incredible production, an artist with such an insane talent, very, very down to earth, with integrity.

I: because when you do opening acts for artists like billie eilish, do you spend time with her?

E: I think it's not even planned, you know an artist like her, with the popularity she has, it's a skill we can't even imagine, the security around her is crazy, we had the luck, for most people of the band (to meet her?), it's (a) funny (story): because she is vegan activist, in each venue, there was what was called a puppy room, puppies which are available for adoption, and that was where I talked with her, so when we chatted we had puppies in our arms and then she was like ""hey I like your band"" and I was like ""omg"" and we thanked her for having us, it was great to know that she knew the band, it wasn't like on a list of (suggestion), it was really her desire/wish to have us, because at her scale we assume that a lot of people work for her so that was really her who wanted us to come so the guys and I thanked her.

I: so it was really an organic meeting, and tyler the creator also wrote you?

E: yes he wrote us in our dms like ""yo I love what you do, oncle jazz is great, I was on youtube"" and overall that was it, we talked earlier abt independence, our best contacts were the ones we made from person to person, you can't buy love, with internet we can all talk to each other, each experience that came to us was direct, Tyler was that, and he was like ""do you want to come at my festival?"" I was like ""yes absolutely"" and when I met him he went to his knee and kissed my hand and I was like ""please get up"" [laughs] he was really cool, it was as simple as that. But it's too bad cause we were supposed to play a second time at camp frog but it got cancelled because of the rain so next time we hope.

I: you'll see him again! You just released two albums with similar themes, donkey and horse, that equestrian love where does it come from

E: that's not an equestrian love [laughs] well no its not true, dragos is obsessed with donkeys, I think sooner or later he's gonna have a donkey in his home [laughs] a love for Latin, language, old words, thats something very present in our music, hidden a bit everywhere in our lyrics, it was a perfect, two perfect terms to speak of two different things coming from a same genome, as you saw, we released two albums with two different energies, we just had too many songs, we liked all of them there was no... we couldnt release an album with 30 songs again, so we made two albums, and we wanted to underline they came from a same period with no confusion between them, so it was the best way for us to express ourselves. Its funny because I think (the names) It came out the first day as a joke and i was like ""ah shit im sure its gonna stay that way"" and it stayed this way [laughs] and we love the titles in the end.

[I come with mud]

I: that was an excerpt of I Come with Mud, the story of two cover pictures of the albums, is also very interesting, can you tell us abt it?

E: yes, so almost 8 years ago I think we were thrifting in a village des valeurs (charity shop). We found a book from the 80s titled ""a day in the life of Canada"" so it had been made in several countries irrc Anyway they reunited professional photographers that worked across Canada to take pictures of Canada for a day, and time and time we came back to that book, there is a lot of famous photographers in it, for our previous album Untourable Album we also took a picture from this book, it was a picture of two kids at Halifax in a school, and, we tried to find back the photographer and it happened to be someone who took photos of Michael Jackson and so for the two albums we went back to that book, its like an inepuisable well of beautiful pictures, so we went through the same process.

I: so you contacted the photographer to be able to use the pictures 

E: yes 

I: it's quite the luck 

E: yes because its from the 80s some of the photographers passed away, some people we couldn't reach because some of them dont use social media so yeah we chose those two pictures and it illustrated the two different energies well. 

I: Yes because the aesthetics we stick to an album, it dresses it up, its like choosing the clothes we decide to wear in the morning, in a way

E: yeah 100% and I think we are just, attracted by pretty pictures and we dont really overthink it, those two pictures which were almost at the middle of the book, we kept coming back to it, and the tones were similar, they were taken by the same photographers, so we chose them.

I: since you tour a lot, you meet artists at festivals, is there anyone you would dream of collaborating with? Artists you met or haven't met yet

E: me right now, right now, there's no one. And a lot of people ask us to collaborate with like, The Marias, who are a band similar to ours, and they are really nice people by the way, and I doubt they will ever listen to me in french [laughs] but I say hi to them, but we would rather work with people who are very different from us, MIT, it may not be obvious, but we have hip-hop influences like, Show me How, that was sampled by Joey Badass, that for instance was a very cool collaboration, we love rappers, we think it gives a new life to our songs, so it would probably be more this kind of collab, our instrumentals/music in a new context like with a rapper, someone with a good flow, when Joey sent us the demo we were immediately: ""oh yes we love that"". But right now, dream collab? No one.

I: yes and sometimes there are artists we love, that we admire a lot but collaborating with them is not the same thing

E: exactly, sometimes we have nothing more to add to them. But instrumental-wise i think there is a lot that we could do. But I think i would leave like, I would let someone else sing for me, I would go do something else, like go drink a coffee [laughs]

I: you have two upcoming shows in Montreal, at MTELUS, 18TH and 19TH of December, how are you gonna approach these two shows? 

E: well it's gonna be our new songs, our new shows like it's gonna be the first time we are gonna do them indoors in Montreal and we are looking forward to it, one or two new songs that we are arranging, we reworked the setlist so we are really excited. 

Cutting here because otherwise it was too long and they were only mentioning the other countries they will play in 2026 :-)

I’m 35M based around Kendal. I’ve got mates, but most of them are settled down now and rarely want to do anything, so I’m hoping to meet some new people who actually like getting out and doing stuff.

A bit about me:  
• Into hiking mostly around the Lakes, always up for exploring.  
• Love live music, especially metal / metalcore but pretty much into anything (even went to the eras tour), been in Manchester constantly for gigs recently.  
• Regular cinema goer (usually Lancaster).  
• Into online gaming, mostly FPS games.  
• Keen to try DnD at some point.  
• Creative and into photography.  
• Enjoy eating out and finding new places to try.  
• Attend the gym semi regularly and trying to be more consistent with it.

I don’t mind doing things solo, I’ve done plenty but I’ve realised I’m really missing shared experiences. Basically, I’m just trying to avoid becoming that guy who only leaves the house for work and Tesco.

Even if it’s just grabbing a coffee or catching a film one evening, I’m up for low key hangs too. Would be great to meet people to hike with, go to gigs with, try new food spots, game with, or just chill and chat.

Work a rotating shift pattern so my days off vary but i have every weekend off, I’m flexible and happy to plan things ahead.

Happy to connect with individuals or small groups the more the merrier.

For years I have been experiencing what seems like diabetes symptoms, but I am constantly assured that I in fact do not have diabetes, or even pre-diabetes.

However, I wake up anywhere from 1 (if I'm lucky) to maybe 6 times per night to pee. It's usually a full amount. If I don't get up to pee, I can't sleep. I also pee a lot during the day.

I go to bed at around 8 pm, and drink almost no water at all after around 3pm. When I wake up I usually feel pretty dehydrated, so I drink a lot of water in the mornings. For a while it was bad, and I was drinking more than 2 gallons of water a day. Now I take electrolytes and I'm probably closer to one.

I also get ravenouly hungry. There have been multiple times in my life where I've been fully convinced I had a tapeworm or something because I could just not stop eating.

I also get a lot of fatigue. And fatigue and hunger are usually worse after I eat. One of my darkest moments was when I ate lunch and had to put my head down on the table immediately after and started crying because it was the middle of the day but I was too tired to even sit up, i felt like i was literally starving to death, and wanted to go for a walk but was too tired. And I didn't even want coffee, all I could think of was more food.

I do rely a lot on caffeine though too. I can usually get by on 2 cups of coffee, but not less than that. I try to do one in the morning and one early afternoon, which usually allows me to stay up until around 8 or 9. Otherwise, I end up in bed before sunset.

I have no idea if any of these symptoms are actually connected. But either way, whats going on with me?

The reason I did this was to have better health and more energy to live my life, but I now live like a hermit. The weight is coming off but I’m so exhausted all the time. I try to sip my weak squash or protein coffee but I get sharp pains in my chest. At other times when not drinking I have a dull ache in my chest like something is sitting on it. I’m constantly thirsty and my head pounds. Often I feel faint as soon as I stand up. 

Eating is such a struggle too. I want to give up trying. A few teaspoons of soft food and I’m hurting. I then belch for an hour like Barney from the Simpsons. It’s disgusting. I’m so sick of soup and yogurt now I feel like I’d rather go without. I’ve been sick a few times and the pain in my stomach, throat and upper back is horrid. I also get watery diarrhoea if I don’t take medication every day but I’m barely having 500-600 cals a day. 

I leave the house to walk my dogs maybe 3 times a week. The rest of the time I’m in bed or trying to work from home for a few hours. I feel too tired to go anywhere or commute to the office. By now I thought I’d be out and about, but I just want to nap. I’ve done nothing for Christmas. I feel like my colleagues must think I’m swinging the lead. I also feel guilty that I’m letting my family down.

Hi everyone!
For a long time I had been planning a trip across Tunisia with my best friend where we wanted to ride a motorbike across the country and explore everything slowly. That trip is still on my bucket list, but now I have an unexpected opportunity to visit Djerba in May with my wife and our small baby. So instead of an adventure trip, this will be a family vacation and I’d love some advice from people who know the island well.

1. How is Djerba for a family holiday?
Is Djerba generally good for families with a small baby? Anything we should be aware of in terms of safety, comfort, or convenience?
2. Beaches – which ones, and are they all accessible?
We’re considering staying either on Sidi Mahres Beach or near Yati Beach.
Are these good choices ?
Are the beaches open to all tourists or are some only accessible if you stay in a particular resort?
3. Transport with a baby
How convenient are taxis for short rides with a small baby and a stroller? For example, going into Houmt Souk for a walk. Do taxis accept strollers easily? Anything to know about pricing?
4. Food recommendations
What traditional Tunisian dishes should we definitely try while in Djerba? Any family-friendly restaurants you’d recommend?
5. Local friendliness & atmosphere
How welcoming are people generally toward tourists and families? Any personal experiences would be great.
6. Typical prices
Could you give me an idea of the cost of:
A basic dinner at a restaurant
A coffee or juice in a cafe
Souvenirs
Tourist activities (rough price range)
Just trying to set a realistic budget.
7. Activities we’re considering
We’ve seen these suggestions and want to know if they’re worth it:
The Crocodile Park
Turtle spots
Pirate ship excursions
Visiting Houmt Souk
Checking out the street art around the island
Visiting old fortresses and historical sites
Any baby-friendly experiences are also welcome!
8. Weather in mid-May
If anyone has experience with Djerba around mid-May, how’s the weather usually?
Is it warm enough for swimming in the sea?
Do people typically swim at that time of year?
How likely is it to have multiple days of rain, or even a full week of bad weather?
9. Cultural etiquette
Is there anything important we should know culturally—gestures, clothing norms, or behavior that might be considered disrespectful? We want to be respectful and avoid any unintentional offense.

**Memory Transcript Subject: Drejana, satisfied Arxur, Wildlife Management, \[Colony/Vishnu Ranger Service Dispatch\]**

**Date \[standardized human time\]: October 6th, 2141**

The sky over the lake was just starting to blush when we finally let ourselves out of the bedroom.

""Sunrise"" felt like a limited word to describe the view before us. Vishnu’s star didn’t so much rise as swell out from behind the ridge line. A soft orange glow spilled across the water, turning the surface into one long pane of glass. The air still held the bite of night, cool against my scales, but it was the pleasant kind of chill—the kind that made warm mugs feel even better in your hands.

Veltep was wedged in snug against my side on the bench, his wool pressed so close to my ribs that I could feel the steady thrum of his heartbeat. His tail was looped lazily with mine where they hung off the edge of the seat, the two of them swaying together every time one of us shifted. He held his mug in both paws, with his snout hovering over the steam as if he could drink in the aroma just as much as the tea. Which, I guess, he could, actually.

Nova had claimed the spot nearest the porch post, one foot braced on the lower railing, his good shoulder resting carefully against the wood. His mug of coffee looked comically small in his claws. His tail draped behind the bench, the heavy weight of it lying over both of ours like a living blanket.

We weren’t talking. We didn’t really need to. There was a warm, pleasantly-used ache in my muscles that made words feel unnecessary and a little too sharp. I was still half-certain if I tried to move too fast, my legs would turn into noodles again, and I’d end up dragging both of them down with me.

Not that I was complaining.

A shudder ran through my body, the tingle spreading under my scales and settling into the bones. I took another sip of my coffee—fake sugar, fake cream, just how I liked it—and watched a pair of pale birds skim low over the water, their wingtips barely disturbing the surface with little ripples over the mirror of the lake.

Vel’s ears tracked them automatically, flicking up against my arm.

""What do you think those are called?"" he murmured, more to himself than to either of us.

""Breakfast?"" I suggested, and felt his wool puff in a tiny, scandalized huff.

""Drej,"" he chided, bapping my shoulder with his ear. ""I thought you said that nothing native was on the menu?""

""Neither am I,"" I said, taking another drink. ""Didn't stop you from nibbling on me earlier.""

Nova gave a quiet snort around the rim of his mug while Veltep's ears and face turned orange. I could feel the heat of it against my scales. He looked more smug than embarrassed, though.

""I only chewed on you because you gnawed on my tail first,"" he muttered. ""You started it.""

I swished my tail, tugging his and Nova's together in a little knot. My brother grunted at the tug, shifting a little so his tail wasn't tugged free of the tangle. I watched his reflection in the lake more than him directly. His scales were clean and reflecting the glow of the sun gently, his dark eyes half-lidded, and the tension in his back and shoulders was gone; the ridge along his spine was almost flat instead of bristling on some invisible alert.

That was how I knew he was relaxed—really relaxed, not the polite, careful calm he wore around strangers. The lines around his eyes were softer. The angle of his jaw had lost that tight, clenched look that made him seem older than he was. Even with his shoulder still bound in the sling, he looked… light.

Veltep followed my gaze, then glanced up at me. His eyes caught the growing light and flicked from their usual soft purple to something brighter.

""Stop staring,"" Nova said, not opening his eyes. ""Feels like you’re trying to set me on fire.""

""If I were trying to set you on fire,"" I said, ""you’d already be crispy. Besides, that Exterminator cosplay was the most downvoted; I got rid of it.""

Veltep sputtered into his tea, the sound muffled by the mug. I reached over and scritched just under his ear, fingers burying into the thick chocolate wool there. ""Kidding,"" I smirked, and he melted sideways into me, all five feet of him pressing closer along my flank. His tail tightened around mine in a lazy squeeze.

""This was a good idea,"" Nova said quietly, once he'd swallowed the last of his coffee. ""Coming out here. I know it was Jacob who pushed for it, but still. I didn’t realize how tired I was until we stopped.""

""You?"" I arched a brow ridge. ""You don’t have to chase Vanyan projections in your sleep.""

""I'm the one who has to chase the actual Vanyan!"" he protested.

""I’m the one who has to keep you two fed between projections,"" Veltep countered.

Nova huffed again, but there was no bite in it. He shifted against the post, careful, rolling his good shoulder. The injured one stayed tucked, held close to his body. I’d seen him wake up stiff and stubbornly insist he was fine, only to grimace when he thought we weren’t looking. This morning, at least, the grimace hadn’t shown up yet.

Another bird call drifted across the water—high and trilling. Vel tipped his head, ears following the sound, eyes shining.

""Think you could convince Chief Richards to transfer us here permanently?"" he asked. ""I’ll run the gift shop.""

""We’d have to drag Rosie with us,"" I said. ""She’d never forgive us if we abandoned her to the lunch rush alone.""

""And the kids,"" Nova added, finally opening his eyes. He turned his head just enough to look back at us, the morning light catching along the old scar on his face and softening it. ""Pretty sure Dominic would riot if we weren’t around for hammer games.""

My chest did a weird little squeeze at that, even if I rolled my eyes a little at the teasing jab. The thought of leaving Blue Hope behind—the kids, the diner, the way the new townsfolk had started greeting us like we belonged there—it felt wrong. This place was beautiful, but it wasn’t *home*.

Maybe someday we’d have time for a second vacation. One that didn’t involve Jacob trying to out-sing an Arxur to pop music.

I smiled into my mug at the memory of last night’s awful karaoke, then let the smile soften as I studied the two warm bodies bracketing me. Nova, too big for the bench but trying to tuck himself small so he wouldn’t crowd us. Vel, sitting in the space between us like it was the most natural thing in the world.

For a moment, I let myself pretend there was nothing waiting for us on the other side of the lake. No reports, no schedules, no corridors or predators or prey. Just us. Just this.

The illusion lasted right up until my pad started buzzing.

I flinched, claws tightening instinctively around my mug before I caught myself. Hot coffee sloshed, but didn’t spill.

""Oh, for—"" I set the mug down on the little side table with a clink and fished the pad out from between my thigh and Vel’s hip. ""If that’s Telif trying to drag us to brunch, I swear, I’m feeding him to the lake this time.""

Vel made a quiet protesting noise. ""You can’t feed Telif to the lake. I haven’t gotten his coconut dal recipe yet.""

""We’ll pry it out of his hands posthumously.""

Nova’s tail gave us both a warning tap.

""Don’t let it go to voice mail,"" he said. ""If it is him, he'll probably annoy Jacob enough to barge in here like a minute later."" He smirked behind his mug.

I huffed, already flicking the pad awake with a clawtip, ready to see Telif’s contact icon and tell him exactly what he could do with his brunch plans.

The little notification window came up, vibrating gently in my palm.

**INCOMING CALL – CHIEF RICHARDS, AMANDA**

All the loose, lazy warmth in my spine tightened at once. My tail stilled where it was wrapped around theirs. On either side of me, I felt Nova and Veltep go abruptly, completely still.

I swallowed, the taste of sweet coffee suddenly thinner on my tongue, and tapped the accept icon.

""Chief Richards, hey,"" I said, putting the pad on speaker and setting it on the little table between our mugs. ""Please tell me this is a prank call and Jacob somehow bribed you to make me suffer.""

""Morning, Drejana."" Amanda’s voice came through a half-second later, a little tinny but unmistakable. Calm, clipped, the way it got when she was trying not to sound worried. ""I wish it was a prank. How’s Aquaria treating you?""

""Wet, loud, and full of bad karaoke,"" I said. ""So you know. Perfect."" I shifted on the bench, letting my tail squeeze Vel’s. ""What’s up? We weren’t due back until Saturday, and you don’t usually call just to say you miss us.""

There was the faint sound of keys in the background, and someone walking by on tile. Amanda blew out a breath I could almost see.

""You’re right, I don’t,"" she said. ""I know you weren’t scheduled on shift until Monday. I’m sorry to cut into your time off, but we’ve got something brewing along the Vanyan–Rak corridor, and I’d rather bring you three home early than regret it later.""

Nova’s claws tightened around his mug. I watched the way his shoulders squared, the little change in posture that meant his brain had already jumped two steps ahead of the conversation.

""Define ‘something’,"" he said, before I could. ""Is this a ‘someone got lost on a trail’ something, or a ‘Rak are knocking on the back door of town’ something?""

""Somewhere in between,"" Amanda replied. ""We’ve had an anomaly in Herd Three’s projected route. Tracking data shows the Vanyan making a sudden change in direction about six hours ago. They turned almost ninety degrees and started angling toward Blue Hope instead of skirting the outer edge of the corridor.""

Veltep’s ears went stiff against my arm.

""That… doesn’t sound right,"" he said carefully. ""Did something spook them? Storm? Quake?""

""We don’t have any seismic events on record for that window,"" Amanda said. ""Weather logs look clean, too. No lightning strikes, no severe fronts. And that’s not all."" The clatter of keys stopped. I could picture her turning to stare at the big map back at the station. ""Three sensors in that slice of the corridor went offline within an hour of the change. Two started feeding corrupted data before they dropped.""

A little knot formed low in my chest. I glanced at the lake, at the birds, and at the way the water sat so perfectly calm. It felt like looking at a picture while someone described a fire just out of frame.

""So we've got a herd of animals that would make a bull moose look like a joke, and they're trundling toward population centers after making an unnaturally hard turn toward town and leaving a little patch of blind corridor right in front of them,"" I summarized. ""Any Rak pings?""

""Some,"" Amanda admitted. ""We’ve had vocalizations and spoor logged closer to the service road than I like. Nothing suggests a full pack movement yet, but it’s… messy.""

Nova’s tail tightened over ours.

""Messy how?"" he asked.

""Overlap in the readings. Gaps where there shouldn’t be."" A pause, then, quieter: ""I can’t tell you it’s natural, and I can’t tell you it’s not. I don’t have enough data. That’s the problem.""

There it was—that thin, sharp edge under her voice. Not panic, but the frustration of someone who knew exactly how bad things *could* get and didn’t want to roll those dice.

""Okay,"" I said, forcing my own voice to stay light. ""So you want your favorite Arxur and their emotional support Venlil back on planet ‘work’ sooner than planned. How soon are we talking?""

That got me a tiny huff of static that might have been a laugh.

""Ideally, this afternoon,"" Amanda said. ""I’ve already pinged Azure and Aquaria’s ranger stations about fast transport options. If you can be packed and at the dock within an hour, we can have you on a shuttle down to Blue Hope by mid-day.""

I felt Veltep shrink in against my side, just a fraction. He caught himself almost immediately and sat up straighter, but I still felt it—the little wobble under the wool.

""We were supposed to just be helping the other team,"" he said. ""The one from Azure. I thought they were taking lead on the corridor work.""

""They are,"" Amanda said. ""But these two know this slice of Vishnu better than they do. Especially Nova. You’ve walked it with him, camped in it, but he's bled in it. When I tell them something’s off, they nod. When *you* tell them,"" I could tell she was talking directly to my brother now, ""they listen.""

Vel’s ears flicked, faint orange creeping into his wool.

""Right,"" he murmured. ""Right. I just… didn’t expect ‘vacation’s over’ to be so literal.""

""We can make it work,"" Nova said. His voice had gone into that calm, practical register he used for checklists and emergency drills. ""If Aquaria can spare a shuttle and Jacob doesn’t chain himself to the cabin door when he hears we’re leaving early."" He glanced over at me. ""You’re okay with cutting it short?""

Am I okay with it? No. Did that matter? Also no.

""You kidding?"" I said. ""If we stay, Jacob’s going to have us doing another karaoke night, and my dignity can’t take that kind of damage twice in a row."" I let my tail give theirs a squeeze. ""We’ll be there, Chief. Tell us where you want us once we hit the station.""

Amanda exhaled slowly.

""I appreciate it,"" she said. ""Once you’re back, I want Nova and Veltep in the corridor briefing with Boro and the Azure team. Drej, I’ll need you on dispatch and comms. We’re going to tighten public access near the anomaly until we know what’s going on.""

Dispatch. Comms. I felt the old, familiar weight of the headset settle over my memory, even out here on the porch. The part of me that still sulked about being stuck behind a desk in a crisis puffed up; the rest of me knew exactly how much worse it could go if no one reliable was watching the lines.

""Got it,"" I said. ""I’ll make sure the board’s clean and ready when we walk in. Anything else we should know before we start packing?""

There was a brief pause, the kind that said there *was* something else, just nothing she was ready to put into words yet.

""Not yet,"" Amanda said finally. ""I’ll forward you the current tracking overlays and sensor logs. Look them over on the way, if you can."" A faint softening came into her voice. ""And… I’m sorry. I know you were looking forward to having a few more days.""

Veltep made a tiny noise that could have been a laugh or a whimper.

""It’s okay,"" he said. ""The lake will still be here.""

""So will Jacob,"" Nova added dryly. ""Unfortunately.""

""I heard that,"" Jacob’s voice shouted faintly in the background of my imagination, which was enough to make me snort.

""We’ll reschedule the ‘relaxation’ part of this trip,"" I said. ""After the corridor stops trying to freestyle its own route.""

This time Amanda’s huff was definitely a laugh.

""I’ll hold you to that,"" she said. ""Safe travels, you three. I’ll inform Azure Station. Call in once you’re on the shuttle.""

""Yes, ma’am,"" we said, almost in unison.

The line clicked off. The pad went quiet.

For a moment, the only sounds were the birds over the lake and the faint clink of Vel’s mug as his paws tightened around it.

""So,"" I said at last, staring at the reflection of the cabin in the water. ""Guess the universe saw us horizontal and decided we were too relaxed.""

Nova huffed a dry little laugh.

""Come on,"" he said. ""Let’s go tell Jacob he’s getting rid of us a day early before he tries to plan a goodbye party.""

—

The next hour blurred into the kind of fast-forward montage you only ever see when someone hits the panic button on real life.

We moved on autopilot at first: mugs rinsed and left in the little cabin sink, bags hauled out from under the bed, our clothes and scattered souvenirs swept into piles and crammed back where they belonged. Nova grabbed the printed resort map and folded it with more care than it deserved; Vel fussed over the room twice to make sure we didn’t leave any chargers or datapads under the furniture.

By the time we stepped out onto the path with our bags, the quiet of the porch felt like it had been a week ago instead of twenty minutes.

We were halfway down the stairs when I spotted a groggy human stumbling out of the bathroom, still half asleep. He stared at us for several moments like he was trying to figure out the meaning of life by looking at the bags in our hands before he finally spoke.

“Has it been a week already?” he asked with a slow blink. 

""No…"" I said. ""Chief called. The wildlife is in fact doing something stupid. We’ve got to head back early.""

For a second, I wasn’t sure what I said even registered with him, but then, I noticed the concern in his posture as Jacob’s gaze flicked from Nova’s shoulder brace to Vel’s ears and back to my face, as if he was checking for some hint of how bad it really was. Then he scrubbed a hand over his own face and let out a heartfelt, ""Goddamn ranger emergencies, but hey, what can ya do?""

And with that, he was wide awake and in full ‘dad mode.’ He didn’t even bother to argue. That was the thing about him—he complained, loudly and creatively, but, the moment he learned someone needed him, he’d already dropped everything and forced you to accept his help, whether you wanted it or not. Within moments he’d herded us back toward the main cabin, throwing open the fridge and jamming containers of leftovers from yesterday into an insulated bag like he was packing us off to college.

""You’re taking the rest of the mac and cheese,"" he said, pointing a spoon at Veltep. ""No negotiations. And the skewers. All of them. If I leave them in here, Bud’s going to ‘accidentally’ have twelve for breakfast, and I am not about to deal with a grumpy Arxur on a doctor-mandated diet again.""

Vel made a flustered noise about not needing that much food and then accepted the bag anyway when Jacob shoved it into his paws. Orange crept into his wool as he muttered something about sharing with the station.

Telif and Sivik drifted in next, drawn by the noise or the sudden scent of cold leftovers. Telif took one look at our bags, clicked his claws together, and groaned.

“So that’s how it is. I almost beat your deck *one* time, and you’re tucking your tail between your legs and running into your boyfriend's arms.”

""Back into the woods, technically,"" Nova said.

That earned a snort from Sivik, who looked, for once, almost as wrung out as we felt. He stepped closer, tail giving a small, uncertain flick, and offered me a clasped paw. I took it, careful not to squeeze too hard.

""Stay safe,"" he said. It came out flatter than he probably meant it to, but there was weight behind it all the same.

""You too,"" I said. ""Try not to let Jacob fall off a mountain or into the lake while we're gone.""

""No promises,"" Jacob said from the kitchen.

Nova growled. ""Jacob, if we get called back here ’cause an out-of-shape human needs an evac off a hiking trail, I swear to God.""

“Rounds a shape!” Jacob retorted.

Telif leaned against the doorframe, arms folded, eyes flicking between us with that too-sharp, too-amused look that always made me feel like I’d missed half the jokes.

""I’m setting up an online game night once we get back home from your little blue planet,"" he declared.

""You say that like you’re not going to get your tail handed to you,"" I shot back.

""I say that like I already have a list of deck techs picked out."" He tapped his pad. ""You can review them firsthand when you’re not being chased by wild animals.""

Veltep’s ears perked despite himself. ""Do… any of them have puns?""

""All of them have puns,"" Telif and Jacob said at the same time, but with vastly different tones.

Before I could decide whether that was a threat or a promise, footsteps thumped on the stairs. Bud had ghosted in so quietly I hadn’t noticed him until he was already at Veltep’s side, arms hooking him into a quick, hard sideways hug.

""Hey, menace,"" Vel said softly, one paw going automatically to Bud’s shoulder. ""We’re not vanishing forever. Just heading home.""

Bud huffed out a breath that was almost a laugh and scrubbed a hand over his face. Up close, the dark smudges under his eyes looked a lot like the ones Nova used to wear when sleep was optional and survival wasn’t.

""Yeah, I know,"" he muttered. ""Just… sucks you’re bailing before the rematch."" He flicked a glance at me and Nova, not quite holding eye contact but closer than when we’d first met. ""You two, uh. Take care of yourselves, okay?""

""We’ll see you again,"" Nova told him. ""You still owe me that rematch on the hammer game. And I’m not letting you pretend you ‘forgot’ your high score.""

That, at least, got the hint of a smile.

""It's called Whack-a-Mole..."" Jacob sighed. 

The rest came in flashes: Jacob hauling our bags toward the dock while Telif rattled off last-minute advice about shoulder stretches and hydration, then turned to promise he’d spam our message threads with screenshots of Jacob trying to hike a trail. Sivik hovered at the edge of the group, as if he wanted to say more and didn’t quite know how.

Too short. All of it felt too short. If I let myself think about it, I was sure I’d start dragging my feet, looking for excuses. One more hour. One more game. One more lap around the lake.

Instead, I kept moving.

The shuttle Aquaria’s ranger station had scrounged up for us was waiting at the end of the delivery dock, nose pointed toward the mountains, hatch yawning open. The lake lapped quietly at the pilings below, indifferent to schedules and sensor readings and corridor anomalies.

We loaded our bags. Jacob squeezed each of us once more, hard enough that even I felt it.

""Next time,"" he said, ""I’m picking somewhere they can't just call you back from. And with more hot tubs.""

""We'll probably need that after we finish up whatever this is,"" I said.

We traded our last, messy wave of goodbyes, and then Nova hit the hatch control before any of us could second-guess it. The ramp drew up with a hiss, cutting off the view of Jacob’s gang from the knees down first, then the waist, then everything but their raised hands.

By the time we buckled in, the shuttle was already lifting. The resort shrank beneath us: the cabins, the little crescent of beach, the firepit where we’d massacred pop songs from half the galaxy the night before. The lake spread out in sudden waves as the engines and anti-grav pushed us higher. Disturbed ripples catching the light.

—

By the time the shuttle dropped us back onto Vishnu’s dirt, the smell of lake water and cheap resort soap had gone sour under my scales.

Blue Hope didn’t have a proper landing pad—just a dirt parking lot out front, and the shuttle did its best to settle on a mostly level patch of packed ground between faded lane lines and a crooked light post. The air felt different here. Drier, dustier, cut through with the familiar mix of coffee, old wiring, and the faint must that clung to the station house. After the clean, wet stone of the resort, it hit my nose like a fist.

Maybe I was still sulking.

We clattered down the ramp with our bags slung over shoulders and across chests. Nova’s sling was back in place, his injured shoulder tucked close to his body. Veltep had stuffed his vacation shirt into his bag but hadn’t quite scrubbed all the lake smell out of his wool. Or ours, actually. And I was pretty sure I had woodsmoke still clinging to the inside of my hoodie and the knees of my jeans.

The ranger station’s screen door sang on its tired spring just like it always did, letting out a long, complaining creak as it swung inward. Nova caught it with his hip before it could snap back, nudged it the rest of the way open with his good shoulder, and ushered us in past him before letting it ease shut behind us with a clatter of coils.

Inside, the light was harsher, more utilitarian. The front room stretched long and narrow: my desk and radio console to the right, filing cabinets along the wall to the left, a row of mismatched chairs pressed up under the windows. A fan hummed somewhere in the back. The scent of stale coffee wrapped around us like a second atmosphere. We dropped our luggage near my desk and headed through the open doorway into the back room.

Amanda was exactly where I’d pictured her during the call: standing in front of the big wall display, arms folded tight across her chest, jaw clenched. The corridor map glowed in front of her, threads of colored lines tracing Vanyan movements over the last few weeks. One section pulsed faintly, an orange blink that deepened the line between her brows.

Boro was there too, leaning up against the edge of the table with his arms braced, watching the screen with the flat focus that meant his brain was already three hypotheticals deep. Petal lay at his feet, the Hensa’s long, sinuous body coiled neatly under the table, harness buckles chiming softly as her head lifted at the sound of our arrival.

Three heads turned as we stepped into the back room.

""You made good time,"" Amanda said. Her gaze flicked from Nova’s sling to the direction of the front room, where we’d dumped our luggage by my desk. ""Did you come straight here?""

""Didn’t think you’d called us back early so we could go do laundry first,"" I said.

The corner of her mouth twitched. ""Fair enough. Have a seat, all of you.""

We did as ordered, fanning out into our usual spots around the table. Nova took up a lean against the back of the nearest armchair so he wouldn’t have to wrestle his sling into a seat. Veltep perched on the edge of the couch, smoothing a paw over his chest as if he could pat himself into looking more official. I took the middle, my usual place, and tried not to think about how much my feet wanted to carry me right back out the door.

Amanda waited until we’d gathered around the map before she spoke again. Up close, I could see the tired smudges under her eyes and the half-empty mug of coffee on the table beside her.

""All right,"" she said. ""You already got the quick-and-dirty version over the phone. This is the long one."" She tapped a fingertip against a pale green line that looped neatly past Blue Hope’s marker. ""This is Herd Three’s projected route—what it should have been.""

Her hand slid, tracing the sharp kink in the data line as it cut inward.

""And this bend is what I was talking about,"" she went on. ""About six hours ago they cut in, almost at a right angle, straightening their path toward town instead of skirting the outer edge of the corridor.""

Nova leaned forward, squinting. Even with only one good arm, he slipped into the same posture he always had in front of a briefing board—weight forward, attention narrowed to a point.

""Same timestamp you sent us?"" he asked.

""Same window,"" Amanda said. ""The overlays haven’t made it any prettier.""

Boro straightened, pushing off the table just enough to reach out and tap two spots along the kinked path.

""Movement spikes here and here,"" he said. ""Enough to call them spooked, but not blind. It feels like they got shoved sideways instead of bolting.""

""And still no weather spike or quake behind that shove?"" Veltep asked. His ears were pitched forward, eyes fixed on the map. I could almost hear him flipping through what he’d learned about Vanyan and their triggers.

""Still nothing,"" Amanda said with a frustrated exhale. ""Like I said on the call: no storms, no seismic events, no lightning, no sudden temperature drops. If something hit them, it wasn’t anything our standard logs caught.""

She shifted her hand higher, to a cluster of icons along the new projected path—little sensor markers, three of which were grayed out.

""Which brings us to these,"" she said. ""Those three went offline within the same hour the herd turned. You can see here—"" she zoomed in with a flick of her fingers, bringing up tiny snippets of data alongside each icon ""—two of them started spitting garbage before they flatlined. Glitched timestamps, nonsense coordinates. The rest are still up, but you can see the gaps.""

My tail tip twitched.

Under the table, Petal let out a low, rumbling huff that set her harness buckles chiming. She didn’t like gaps either.

Boro's paw instantly went to calm her as he stared at the maps, a comfort reaction more than a conscious effort.

""And because the universe loves piling on,"" Amanda continued, ""we’ve also got the Rak readings I mentioned."" She toggled a different overlay, and red markers lit up along a maintenance road that cut parallel to part of the herd’s new path. ""These are the vocalizations and spoor logs I mentioned earlier, from the last day and a half. Same data I told you about, just uglier when you see how close it runs to where Herd Three is headed.""

For a moment, the room was quiet except for the hum of the fan and Petal’s slow, steady breathing.

""If the herd keeps angling this way and a pack decides to test the perimeter near a settlement at the same time…"" Amanda let the sentence trail off. We could all fill in the rest.

""Officially,"" Amanda went on, ""this could still be a natural shift. Animals get spooked. Tech fails. Unofficially?"" She shook her head. ""It doesn’t feel right. Not with the timing. Not with that many eyes going dark all at once.""

I swallowed around the dry feeling in my throat.

""So, what’s the plan?"" I asked.

""Recon,"" Boro said. ""Sooner rather than later. I want boots and claws on the ground between here""—he tapped one end of the grayed-out stretch—""and here. Check the sensors, see what kind of shape the corridor’s in, and figure out what the Vanyan are doing before they get too close to people.""

Petal’s head came up a little higher at that, harness jingling.

""Petal and I will take point,"" he continued. ""We’re already logged for field duty today. Nova, I want you with us. You know this slice better than anyone."" He hesitated, eyes flicking to the sling. ""We’ll keep your load light.""

His gaze slid to Veltep next.

""As for you,"" Boro said, ""this is strictly voluntary. You’re not logged as field staff, and I’m not about to pretend you are. But an extra set of eyes that knows what’s ‘normal-weird’ out there would help. If you *want* in, we can use you—on one condition."" He lifted a paw. ""You stick to me or Nova the entire time. No wandering off for ‘just a better angle’ or ‘one quick look.’""

Veltep’s paws tightened on the edge of the table. His ears did a little uncertain twitch.

""I… want to help,"" he said. ""Even if I’m not formally trained. If I end up in the way, you’ll say so, right?""

""You get in the way, I’ll park you on a rock and have Petal sit on your tail,"" Boro said, not unkindly. ""Until then, your shopkeeper’s brain is an asset. You’ve been cataloging what you see for weeks now, even if you’ve only been cramming Vanyan into neat little boxes for a few days. I want that with me when we’re looking at tracks and scat and broken branches. And you remember what I said—one of us stays in your line of sight at all times.""

Orange crept up Vel’s neck, but this time it looked more like embarrassment than panic.

""Right,"" he said. ""Okay. I can do that. And I’ll stay close.""

Nova rolled his shoulder carefully, testing range. I saw the slight hitch near the top of the motion, the way his jaw tightened for a breath and then relaxed again when he pretended nothing had happened.

""I’m good to go,"" he said. ""Just tell me how long we’ve got to prep.""

Amanda gave him a look that said she’d seen the hitch too, but she didn’t argue.

""You’ve got an hour,"" she said. ""Gear up, grab something to eat, check your kits. I want you moving before the light starts changing. We’re not going to push into anything after dark if we can help it.""

Her gaze shifted to me.

""Drej, I need you on dispatch,"" she said. ""You’ll have primary on all comms for this run. Log every call, every sighting. If a settler so much as thinks they saw a shadow where it shouldn’t be, I want it noted. If anything happens to this line while they’re out there, they’re blind.""

My scales tingled. I glanced instinctively toward the side wall, where the dispatcher’s desk sat half in shadow. The console lights were dark now, but in my mind I could already see them lit—rows of indicators, channel toggles, and the headset waiting on its hook.

The part of me that wanted to be out there, shoulder-to-shoulder with them in the corridor, made a small, sulky noise. The rest of me stomped on it.

""You’ll have it,"" I said. ""I’ll fire up the board, get the channels clean, and put out a notice to the settlements near the anomaly. If anyone so much as sneezes into a radio, I’ll know.""

""Good."" Amanda straightened, some of the tension easing from her shoulders now that there was a plan. ""Questions?""

We traded glances. Nova shook his head. Vel’s ears twitched once, then settled. I just lifted my tail in a little half-salute.

""All right,"" she said. ""Gear up and be back here in fifty. I’ll have the latest overlays pushed to your pads by then. We’ll do a last check and send you out.""

That was the dismissal. The room shifted around it: Boro pushing off the table, Petal uncoiling in one smooth motion, and Nova stepping back with the careful, controlled movements he used when he was pretending he didn’t hurt. Veltep pushed up from the couch, already running a mental list of what needed to be swapped from ""vacation"" to ""field"" as we headed back toward the front room.

I turned as if to follow them, my body already ticking off tasks: boot up the console, check the headsets, grab a fresh notepad for scratch logs. But my eyes dragged back to the map.

The corridor lines gleamed softly against the wall. Herd Three’s path pulsed at that wrong little angle, cutting in toward the orange blink where the sensors had gone dark. From a distance, it was just another icon on another screen. Data. A glitch. A maybe.

Up close, it felt like pressure building behind my ribs.

""From the outside,"" I murmured, mostly to myself, ""it’s just a blinking light.""

My tail curled tighter around my ankles.

""From here,"" I added, ""it feels like the first wobble before a landslide.""

I forced myself to turn away from the map and head for the dispatcher’s desk. If a landslide was coming, the least I could do was make damn sure the lines stayed clear long enough to yell about it.

We lived under the red star, and the star never blinked.

My name doesn’t matter. In the village they still call me by my father’s name, and that is enough.

I was nine the year the older boy hit me with the pipe.

Third grade, morning shift. Classes ended at 13:30 because the factory needed the mothers and fathers for the second rotation. 

Four kilometres of cracked asphalt and dust between the school and the block of flats. No buses; petrol belonged to the State. Children walked alone. That was the rule. 

He stepped out from the poplars that lined the irrigation canal. Fourteen, maybe fifteen. Eighth-grade uniform, red Pioneer scarf knotted like a noose. 

He didn’t speak. Just raised the iron pipe—cut-off scaffolding, the kind we stole from collective farms to fix our balconies—and brought it down on the exact same place a guard in Siberia had once broken my grandfather’s skull.

I remember the sun flashing on the metal. Then the world went red. I stayed behind, watching him walk away without a care. Blood mixed with my tears, hands pressed to my head while I asked the empty air,

“Why? Why did you hit me? What did I ever do to you?” The feeling of impotence was overwhelming. He was too big, too strong. I cried because I could do nothing else.

I made it home by walking in the ditch so nobody saw the blood. Told my mother I’d fallen off the parallel bars. She looked at me once, saw the lie, and beat me anyway for ruining the shirt. The Party gave us one new shirt every two years, so I had really done it this time.

I never told anyone who did it. Informing was for dogs. 

Six years later I was fifteen. The country still wore grey, but the grey had begun to rot at the edges. The older boys were doing their two years of “patriotic service.” They came home on Sunday passes drunk with power and plum brandy, uniforms too big for the men they hadn’t become. I was buying cigarettes behind the bus station with coins I’d stolen from the factory collection box when I heard his voice—older, thicker, but the same laugh.

He was telling his friend they would meet two girls at the old path above the hidden beach. The path the border guards had stopped patrolling after the minefield was laid farther north. 

Thirty metres straight down to rocks and black water. I knew every stone. That was the place I grew up—where we hid to smoke, where we made campfires when the militia was someone we knew or just a lazy communist.

Hearing that voice reopened a wound that had never truly closed. That night the rage came back, colder than the day it happened. I remembered my mother’s beatings, and the scar on my scalp still ached. 

I went down to the basement, took the same kind of pipe (still there, still rusted, heavy and cold), and walked to the cliffs. I hid just metres from the path, crouched in the bushes. 

Outside it was already dark, and a warm spring wind pushed the salty breath of the Black Sea into my face.

The girls arrived first, scarves pulled low, whispering about university exams they would never be allowed to take. They passed two metres from me and smelled of cheap lilac water.

A few minutes later the boys came along the same path.

I stood up behind them.

The first swing found the exact same place where he had scarred me. He dropped like a sack of maize. His friend screamed once—a thin, useless sound swallowed by the sea—and ran.

I hit until the pipe was soft with hair and the rocks underneath were wet. A strange feeling of freedom and relief surged through me. Blood boiled in my veins. I was not scared. I felt no remorse.

Then I ran.

It was 22:30 when I reached the block. Blood had dried into a second skin, but I hadn’t realised I was covered in it.

My mother opened the door, saw me, and dragged me into the kitchen by the hair. When she realised the blood was not mine, she went quiet—the way people go quiet before a storm. Then she started hitting. Not slaps; closed fists, the way her own father had taught her after crawling back from Siberia missing four toes and all mercy. 

She used the wooden spoon the Pioneer committee had awarded her for “exemplary ideological education of the child.” She slammed my head against the walls. I felt warm blood running down my back. I didn’t defend myself—she gave me this treatment every week. I only hoped one day she would hit hard enough that I never got up again. Pain had lost all meaning. Life had never had any value for me until that night.

My father came in barefoot, eyes still red from the night shift. He tried to pull her off. She bit his wrist. He struck her once—the way men hit under communism when words are no longer enough. She fell between the table and the stove and stayed there.

The kitchen smelled of blood, coffee, and fear.

My father washed my face in the sink, water running pink into the drain.

“What did you do? Why did she do this? Tell me.” Fear I had never seen before was painted across his face.

I told him everything. The pipe when I was nine. The laugh behind the bus station. The sound the skull made when it finally gave.

He listened without blinking. Then he sat for five, maybe ten minutes, staring at the blank wall.

“Tell me exactly where this happened. Tell me everything again.”

I told him again. “Behind the last train station on line 201. Just fifty metres farther.”

“And the pipe?”

“I threw it in the garbage container at the station.”

He stood, carried my mother to the bedroom, closed the door, and came back.

“Shower. Put all the clothes in a bag. And go to sleep.”

I stood under the water until my skin wrinkled. I thought about the window—fourth floor, quick. Thought about the belt—quiet. Thought about swimming out until the cold took me and the militia wrote “accidental drowning,” the way they did for everyone who disappeared.

I decided the sea would be cleaner.

I never slept.

At 05:47 the front door opened again. My father came in alone. His boots left half-moon prints of wet sand and black earth across the linoleum. He smelled of salt, pine disinfectant, and something sweeter—the chemical they used in the morgue when bodies waited too long. He went to the bedroom first. Stayed a few minutes. I could hear him speaking low to my mother. He came out with his eyes empty.

He started the coffee. I walked in.

“No school today.”

I nodded.

“This is the biggest mistake you will ever make in your life.”

“I’m sorry, father.”

“Too late.” He lit a Carpați with fingers that wouldn’t stop shaking. “His parents will never see him again. The army will write ‘desertion.’ Nobody will ever know what happened to him. You will never speak of this—not to your wife, not to your children, not in the confession booth, not on your deathbed. Never.”

He drank the coffee standing up, put on his factory jacket, and left for the morning shift.

Just another Tuesday under the red star.

Mother woke around noon.

She came into the kitchen without a word, face swollen on one side, the print of Father’s hand still purple across her cheek.

She lit the stove, put water for coffee, and sat opposite me—the same chair where she had beaten me hours earlier.

I waited for the screaming to start again. It never came.

Instead she stared at the cracked table and spoke so quietly I had to lean in.

“Your grandfather crossed a river once,” she said.

“January. Forty-nine below. The guards shot the dogs first so the barking wouldn’t carry. He walked on the bodies of men who had fallen before him. Ice broke. Water took his boots, then his toes, one by one. When he reached the other side he had no feeling left below the knees, but he kept walking because the Russians were still behind.”

She stirred the coffee and let her gaze drift toward the Black Sea through the thin window.

“He came home in 1954. Skinny, grey, eyes like holes. The first night he slept in his own bed he woke screaming that the guards were dragging him back. My mother tried to calm him. He beat her unconscious with the same fists that had carried him across the ice. Said if she was soft the Russians would smell it on her and come for all of us.”

She looked at me then. Really looked.

“I was seven. He made me stand in the yard in February with no coat until I stopped crying. Said tears freeze and give your position away. When I came inside he beat me with the belt for shivering too loud. Every time I flinched he said, ‘Good. Remember this feeling. It will keep you alive.’”

The coffee boiled over. She didn’t move.

“That is what they taught him in the camp. Pain is a language. If you speak it first, nobody can use it on you.”

She tapped the spoon against the cup. Tap. Tap. Tap. Like bones.

“I thought I was teaching you to survive,” she whispered. “I thought if I made you hard enough, the world would leave you alone.”

Her voice cracked on the last word. Not tears—she had none left. Just the sound of something inside her finally breaking after forty years.

“I was wrong,” she said. “The world doesn’t leave you alone. It just waits until you’re the one holding the pipe.”

She stood, walked to the window, and stared out at the grey blocks, the laundry lines, and the red star still painted on the water tower even though nobody believed in it anymore.

“Go to your room,” she said without turning. “Your father will say what needs to be said when he comes home tonight.”

I went.

That was the only time she ever told me about her father.

The only time she ever came close to an apology.

Later, when the regime fell and people burned portraits in the streets, I understood: the guards never left Siberia. They just came home inside the people who survived them.

And some of us learned the language so well we started speaking it to our own children.

Forty-three years passed. The regime died choking on its own flags. I married, had children, watched them grow up in a country that pretended it had never been afraid.

My father died first. Heart attack on the exact spot of the hidden beach where he once buried a boy. They found him face-down in the sand, one hand clutching a brown hat he had kept since 1956.

At the wake my mother pulled me into the same kitchen. She was eighty-three, thin as a winter branch.

“He wasn’t dead when your father got there,” she whispered. “Barely breathing, but the eyes were still moving. Your father pressed one heavy hand over the boy’s mouth and nose until the eyes stopped moving. Carried him farther down the cliff and covered him with rocks, sand, and quicklime from the collective. He went back three nights to make sure the dogs didn’t dig.”

She lit one of his old cigarettes with a match that trembled the way his hands had trembled every morning for forty-three years.

“He saw that boy’s face every single night until the day he died. Every night. Even after the wall came down. Even after they gave us passports and blue jeans and Coca-Cola. That face never left him.”

She inhaled until the coal burned her fingers. Then she stubbed it out on the same table where she had once beaten me for bleeding.

Three days after the funeral my mother placed a small wooden box on the kitchen table.

Same table. Same cracks. Same ghosts.

“Open it,” she said. “He wanted you to have this when I was gone too.”

I lifted the lid.

On top lay a yellowed newspaper from 1962. Front page. A grainy photograph of a young man in uniform, headphones around his neck, fingers flying over a Morse key. The headline screamed in red ink: BEST TELEGRAPHIST OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC – AN EXAMPLE FOR THE YOUTH!

His name underneath. My father at nineteen. The same eyes that could freeze a room without a word.

Under the paper: an Orex automatic watch stopped forever at 03:17. A stack of black-and-white photos. Father as a boy near the Russian border, barefoot in the snow, holding a dead hare twice his size.

Father in Moscow, 1964, standing stiff beside Red Square, medals he never wore again.

Father drunk at a wedding, smiling in a way I had never seen in life.

And at the bottom, folded small so it wouldn’t tear, the medical report from 1955.

I knew the story, but never the paper.

He was fifteen. Working the collective fields up north, near the Soviet border where winters eat men. A tractor turned too sharp. The driver didn’t see the boy behind. The blade caught him across the head and peeled the scalp clean off like the skin of an orange.

They carried what was left of him home on a door. The doctor told the family: “Prepare the hole.”

They dug it that same evening. Carved a wooden cross. Wrote his name, the dates 1940–1955.

Three nights later he opened his eyes.

He never spoke about the dark he saw. Only once, drunk on plum brandy when I was twelve, he told me the cold had felt like home.

After that he drank every day, but never raised a hand.

The anger lived in his eyes instead—grey, flat, impossible to meet for more than a split second. People crossed the street when he walked. Even the militia looked away.

He spoke Russian and French like a native, could solve equations in his head faster than the engineers at the factory, but he chose the dirtiest job on the line. Twelve-hour shifts, oil up to the elbows, far from any Party office that might remember the newspaper photograph.

He wanted to disappear.

The regime had made him a hero once. He spent the rest of his life running from the medal.

I turned the watch over. On the back, scratched with a nail decades ago:

Я ВИДЕЛ (Ya videl) I saw.

Mother watched me read it.

“He learned Russian in Moscow,” she said. “Six months attached to a signals unit. They taught him the language and how to hate it. When he came home he never spoke it again—except when he was drunk and crying in his sleep. Then it was always the same two words.”

She took the newspaper, smoothed it with her palm as if she could still flatten the past.

“He never hit you,” she said.

“Never. Even when you deserved it. Even after that night on the cliff. He carried enough for both of you.”

I closed the box.

That evening I walked to the cemetery. The grave was fresh, the earth still black. I opened the Orex, wound it once, twice. The second hand jerked, then moved. 03:17 became 03:18.

Somewhere under the soil he was still counting.

I left the watch on the mound. Let time keep walking for him now.

When I got home the wind had come in from the sea, carrying the smell of salt, pine, and something metallic underneath.

I stood on the balcony and listened. For the first time in forty-three years I heard two sounds at once: the pipe finding the exact same place, and a telegraph key tapping out a message no one would ever answer.

I go to the cliffs sometimes. The path is overgrown now. Tourists come for the view and never know that a young man lies dead beneath their feet.

I still wonder why he did it. What demons made him grab that pipe and break my head?

I know my demons sleep now, but they visit me in my dreams.

Are his parents still alive? Does anyone else still think of him?

Or am I the only one left carrying him?

When the wind is right I still hear it: the sound a pipe makes when it finds the exact same place twice.

Under communism we learned that some debts cannot be paid. They can only be passed on.

And the red star is gone. But the night remembers everything.

1pfy512,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1pfy512/can_tapering_really_be_this_hard/,Can tapering really be this hard?,"I'm interested in hearing others experiences with tapering. 

Context: I'm trying to cut back on caffeine because I am historically very sensitive to it and I suspect even the coffee I drink in the morning makes is cutting into my sleep at night. For at least the past 10-15 years, my minimum daily dose of coffee in the morning has been making up to the ""4"" line on my coffee pot, using about 3.5-3.75 loosely measured heaping tablespoons of coffee. I occasionally would have extra coffee around noon during the workday, but have been pretty good about not doing that recently as it definitely kept me up later.

This week, I tried to cut down to making 1/2 less ""cups"" (as measured by my coffee pot, now aiming for halfway between and 3 and 4 lines), using just 3 heaping tablespoons of coffee, forgoing the last extra 1/2 to 3/4 spoonful I used to do.

Almost a week later and I'm struggling with fatigue, lethargy, feeling down, walking around zombie like, etc... seeing as I only reduced my daily intake around 15-20%, it seems hard to believe that this tiny reduction in coffee is causing that? Or have others had the same experience trying to taper as well?

1pfy4qg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkArchive/comments/1pfy4qg/i_digitize_old_911_calls_for_the_city_one_of_the/,I Digitize Old 911 Calls for the City. One of the Tapes Isn’t in Our System.,"I know how this sounds, but our old 911 recordings all stop at exactly 37 seconds—only I can hear what keeps talking after that.

I listen to other people’s worst moments for a living.

There’s a windowless room in the basement of City Hall, three floors under the clerk’s office, past a “Records” sign that’s yellowed where the tape is. Inside that room: four metal shelves of cardboard boxes, one metal desk, a tape deck older than I am, a wheezing desktop PC, and a pair of headphones that still smell faintly like someone else’s sweat.

My job is to digitize old 911 calls. That’s it. I sit, I press play, I listen, I type a few notes, I hit save. Eight hours a day. Lights humming, vents coughing dust.

You do anything long enough, it turns into background noise. Including people screaming.

Car wrecks, home invasions, overdoses, arguments that end in sudden silence. I got used to it faster than I thought I would. After a week, I wasn’t hearing people anymore, just “a domestic disturbance at 19:42,” “possible shots fired,” “caller disconnected.”

Some calls still stuck with me, though. A road I drive past every morning. A kid’s voice. A dog that barks through the whole call and then cuts off mid-yelp. I kept a folder on my desktop for those and labeled it “anomalies,” like that made it clinical.

The one I’m writing about never made it into that folder.

We were midway through the 1998 tapes. Most boxes had neat dates in black marker — “JAN–MAR 98,” “APR–JUN 98.” One didn’t. No label, just shoved between them, dustier than the others.

I almost skipped it. Curiosity won.

Inside were five tapes in cloudy plastic cases, the kind that look like baby VHS boxes. Each case had a number written on it in ballpoint pen: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. No dates, no incident codes, nothing else.

I grabbed #1, slid it into the deck, and put on the headphones.

No three-tone beep like normal. Just a hiss of dead air and then a man’s voice, low and close, like he was talking right into my ear.

“Is this… working?”

Pause. The counter on the deck ticked up.

“Hello,” he said. “There’s no operator, is there? Okay. I’ll just… talk, then.”

No dispatcher. No “911, what’s your emergency.” Just him and the soft static under his words.

He sounded calm. Too calm.

“I’m in the archive room,” he said. “Basement level. Four shelves. One desk. Fluorescent lights. Smells like dust and burnt coffee.”

The hairs on my arms stood up.

I turned and looked around my own little concrete box: four shelves, one desk, flickering lights. The carpet by the door still had a brown ring where somebody had dropped a pot of coffee long before I worked there.

Common office setup, I told myself. Lots of basements look like this. Coincidence.

On the tape, his chair creaked as he shifted. It made the same high, whining sound my chair makes when I lean forward.

“I’m here,” he said, “because they told me to keep going until I hit the end. I don’t think there is one. I think someone lied.”

That got my attention. I glanced at the tape case again. Someone else’s handwriting, cramped and slanted.

“That’s all right,” he said. “I’ll just keep talking. It feels better than being quiet. When it’s quiet, I can hear it moving.”

My finger hovered over pause.

“It’s behind me,” he said. “Most of the time. Right now it’s in the corner, near the ceiling. I can hear the vents change when it moves. The air goes… different.”

Right on cue, the vent above my head rattled and coughed out a thin breath of cold air.

I told myself I was wound up from too much caffeine, nothing more. I opened a new note in the system and typed:

Unknown caller. No dispatcher. Self-referential description of archive room. Possible test recording?

On the tape, the man went quiet for a few seconds. I could hear him breathing.

Then, clear as anything:

“It’s okay,” he whispered. “He doesn’t know yet.”

I pulled the headphones off like they’d burned me.

The room was exactly the same: beige paint peeling at the corners, a scuff on the floor where a cabinet used to be, a water stain on the ceiling that kind of looks like Australia if you squint. The vent sat there, quiet.

When I looked back at the deck, the counter read 00:37.

Thirty-seven seconds.

I’d heard at least a minute. The “he doesn’t know yet” line alone would’ve pushed it over.

I rewound, hit play again, and watched the numbers. Beep. Hiss. Breath.

“Is this… working?”

He did the whole spiel. “I’m here because they told me to keep going…” “Feels better than being quiet…” up to “When it’s quiet, I can hear it moving.”

At 00:37, the tape clicked and stopped.

No “he doesn’t know yet.” No vents. Nothing.

I didn’t log anything else about it that day. I pushed it into the back of my head and did normal boxes. Car crashes, noise complaints, the usual.

That night, in bed, in the dark, I kept thinking about the creak of his chair.

The next morning, I came in an hour early.

Nobody was down there that early. The front desk lady was still unlocking the main doors when I walked past. The copy room was dark. My basement hallway was empty.

I closed my door, sat down, popped tape 1 back in, and this time I set my phone on the desk and hit record on its voice memos, too.

The tape spun. The counter ticked.

“Is this… working?”

Same voice. Same weird pause. Same room description. Same line about “I don’t think there is one.”

Thirty-five seconds. Thirty-six. Thirty-seven—

The deck clicked and stopped.

In my ears, he kept talking.

“I think someone lied,” he said. “That’s all right. I’ll just keep talking. It feels better than being quiet. When it’s quiet, I can hear it moving.”

Forty-three seconds.

“It’s behind me,” he said. “Most of the time…”

Fifty-four seconds.

“It’s okay,” he whispered. “He doesn’t know yet.”

Sixty-one.

“Not him. The next one.”

My skin went cold. I hadn’t moved. The deck was stopped. The counter frozen at 00:37.

“Don’t test me with your phone this time,” he said. “You already know it won’t work.”

I ripped the headphones off.

My phone’s memo app showed a 00:37 recording. I played it back with the volume up.

Beep. Hiss. Breath.

“Is this… working?”

It cut off mid-sentence at “It feels better than being—”

Everything past thirty-seven seconds was gone.

I left it at that. I did not touch that box for two days.

On the third day, I came back from lunch and found the unlabeled box sitting dead-center on my desk.

I hadn’t put it there.

When I went upstairs for my sandwich, the basement door was locked behind me like always. The sign-in sheet at the front desk showed no one else going down in that ten-minute window.

Could’ve been a prank, I told myself. Somebody with a master key. Some maintenance guy thinking he was funny.

I opened the box.

Tapes 2 through 5 sat lined up like little gray teeth. Tape 1 was missing.

There was another case in there, though. Same cloudy plastic, same kind of tape. The number “1” was written on it again, but the ink looked newer, darker.

I didn’t want to touch it. I did anyway.

The deck reset. I pressed play.

“Is this… working?”

Same voice. But this time, instead of listing the room, he said:

“You changed your password. That’s smart.”

My hand froze on the keyboard.

IT had made us change our passwords that morning. I’d picked something different from my usual, added two numbers that I always think about when I type them because they’re the middle of my phone number. Nobody watched me do it. The door was shut.

“I like this version better,” he said. “Eight characters. Two numbers. You think about your phone number when you type them.”

My fingers curled away from the keys.

“Don’t test me with your phone this time,” he said. “You already know it won’t work.”

I took the headphones off, set them down, and went upstairs to tell my supervisor I had a migraine.

Back home, I unplugged my landline and turned my cell off. I still heard his voice when I tried to sleep. Not the words, just the rhythm. The way he paused, like something else in the room had to finish breathing first.

The next morning, the unlabeled box was back on its original shelf when I came in. Tape 1 sat in its spot like nothing had changed. If you’d walked in fresh, you’d think it had never moved.

I didn’t touch it.

I spent the morning on boring calls. A neighbor’s loud music. A drunk guy who kept insisting he needed “the number for Domino’s.” A kid whispering into the phone until his mom caught him.

At lunch, I ate at my desk. When I looked up from my sandwich, the tape deck’s red counter was lit.

00:37.

The power light was off. The deck wasn’t even plugged in.

I walked around the desk and checked anyway. The plug was lying on the floor. I’d unplugged it the day before and never put it back.

The counter stayed on.

That was it for rational explanations.

I plugged the deck back in with shaking hands. Sat down. Put the headphones on.

Silence.

Then a breath.

“I don’t have much time,” the man said. Closer this time. Like he’d moved from the far end of a hall to right beside me.

“You’ll get curious,” he said. “If not today, then tomorrow. Or next month. Or the day your brain’s tired and you forget why you were scared. You’ll put in the second tape. You’ll listen to the third. You’ll wonder how far it goes.”

I looked at the box. 2, 3, 4, 5.

“You’re not the first,” he said. “We all think we’re smarter. We all think we’ll listen a little and stop. That’s how it gets inside the room.”

Something creaked behind his voice — that slow, complaining sound of metal under new weight. My own chair answered it when I shifted.

“It likes us listening,” he said. “It likes the attention.”

My tongue felt dry. “How long have you been there?” I asked.

He gave a tired little laugh.

“You’ll see,” he said. “If you keep going.”

There was a rustle, like he’d turned his head.

“It’s behind you,” he whispered.

My shoulders knotted up. I stared dead ahead at the wall in front of me: the crack near the baseboard, the embedded paperclip, a faint scuff mark from somebody’s boot.

“You’re going to be tempted to turn around,” he said. “Just to prove there’s nothing there. You’ll do it fast, like ripping off a bandage.”

The vents hummed. The air felt thicker, like it had weight.

“I did that,” he said. “I don’t remember what I saw. I remember the sound. It was like something stepping into a body and realizing it fits.”

My grip tightened on the edge of the desk until my fingers hurt.

“I don’t want to make another one,” he said quietly. “But I can’t stop you. All I can do is warn you.”

The counter still read 00:37.

“You’re wondering why it doesn’t show up,” he said. “Why the recording cuts off when you play it anywhere else. Why you can’t prove this is real. Why nobody complains about noise from down here.”

He was hitting every thought I’d been trying not to think.

“It doesn’t like being recorded,” he said. “It only likes being heard.”

The vent above me coughed. A pocket of cold air slid down the back of my neck.

“You can leave,” he said suddenly. “Right now. Stand up. Walk upstairs. Tell your boss the tapes are corrupted, request a different assignment. Quit. Move. Smash your headphones. Forget my voice.”

There was a pause that went on long enough I thought the call had dropped.

“You won’t,” he said finally. “You already put the first tape in. That’s how it starts.”

Static thickened around his words, like a crowd pressing in.

“I have to go,” he said. “It’s closer now. And you’re going to—”

The sound cut.

Not a click. Not the usual mechanical stop. Just a hard edge of nothing.

I pulled the headphones off and stood up. The room swayed a little. My hand went out toward the door automatically.

All I had to do was grab the knob, open the door, walk out. Tell someone upstairs there was an issue with the old equipment. Ask for IT.

I took one step.

Behind me, my chair creaked.

I hadn’t touched it.

The vent above my head exhaled. The air changed again — not colder, not warmer, just wrong. Like walking into a room you thought was empty and realizing someone was already standing there.

My hand hovered a few inches from the knob.

In that dead quiet, over the blood rushing in my ears, I heard the faintest sound.

Tape moving.

Not in the deck on my desk. Somewhere higher. Somewhere behind me. The soft, dry spin of spools turning.

A voice came with it, almost too soft to catch. Close enough I could feel my skin pull tight between my shoulder blades.

“Don’t turn around,” it whispered. Same man. Same tone. “Please.”

I’m writing this at home, later. On my own laptop, with no tape decks in the room. The city doesn’t let us take physical media out of the building, so the only thing I brought with me is whatever I remember.

If you’re waiting for a clean ending, I don’t have one.

1pfy2u4,https://i.redd.it/39vjqmgf0n5g1.jpeg,Bacha Coffee,"My coffee journey(atleast black coffee) started two years when I was in vietnam and my friend asked me to bring coffee beans from Vietnam for him, and i thought, what the hell I will get some for me too. I ended up purchasing “Mr Viet” and “Trung Nguyen” and when i was back home i purchased Moka pot to make them. Move forward to this week, I am in Singapore and looking around to purchase some coffee beans to take back. I find this very good looking Orangish shop named,  Bacha Coffee.
I purchased two coffee,
       1. Easy pour coffee - 
             Really liked the taste of easy pour, it was mild roast and felt pleasant to drink, not too much bitter. Tried it only Hot.  4.5/5
        2. Coffee, Orange flavour. 
              This one was little effy to me, orange taste was little overpowering plus it was bitter too. I have mixed opinions about it. Somedays i really liked the overpowering flavour and somedays it just feels bad. I tried it Hot, 3.5/5 and cold 4/5, Cold does feel better for the taste, it makes it feel like you are drinking some flavoured drink. 

Has anyone else have tried them, what are your opinions and how do you make them?

1pfy274,https://www.reddit.com/r/spongebob/comments/1pfy274/im_i_being_too_hard_on_the_ending_of_krab_borg/,I'm I being too hard on the ending of Krab Borg?,"If there was ever an episode from the early seasons of SpongeBob where I felt the episode in general was good (a score of 8/10) but completely reversed (at the very least give it a Meh) by the very ending it would Krab Borg. My conclusion is primarily based on the fact that Mr. Krabs did nothing wrong in the entire episode yet got a lot of his belongings destroyed in a mean-spirited manner by SpongeBob and Squidward and it ends rather unsatisfactory with SpongeBob just running away from his problems when he is just as guilty as Squidward. This is certainly not the worst ending of an episode from even Seasons 1-9 it's just what makes this ending leave a bad taste in my mouth is that how to fix it or end it satisfactory is so basic (SpongeBob and Squidward get comeuppance). After reading that Krab Borg is regarded as a personal favourite or the best episode by some people, I started to wonder if I'm being too hard on the ending. I watched the episode several times recently and did this analysis.

# Comedy

The comedy in Krab Borg is where people have said that while they can see where I'm coming from with the ending, the rest of the episode is so funny that they can excuse the ending. In chronological order I like the scene with the guy in the moving running and seeing how fake everything is in the movie including him screaming, SpongeBob saying "" I SURRENDER!"" makes me chuckle but isn't gutbustingly hilarious and Mr. Krabs doing the Robot Dance is funnier, my favourite part has to be when Squidward tells that pirate joke and Spongebob tells Mr. Krabs that Squidward loves him, I don't find the ""Not the Navy!"" line very funny, maybe if it was the Garbage Dump that would be more funny, I like how Mr Krabs asks ""Who's watching the cash register?!"" and when Squidward says ""We can do this all night if you want"". Lastly, I like how the movie ended with it being realized that there were no robots it was just everyone's imagination. Pretty funny in that the fear that robots were everywhere and taking over the world was so great that SpongeBob didn't realize that there were no robots until Squidward asked how the movie ended.

Overall, I can say that this episode does have good comedy, not gutbustingly to me, but enough to say that the episode can make someone at the very least chuckle more than a few times. I find Jellyfish Jam, Bubble Buddy, Dying for Pie, Sailor Mouth, Squid on Strike, The Bully, Nasty Patty, Squilliam Returns, Wet Painters, and The Camping Episode to list off a few having a lot more comedy in my opinion.

# Story

The story up till the very ending is something I can enjoy. I like how even though we the audience know that Mr. Krabs isn't a robot it plays with SpongeBob and Squidward being hysterically adamant that he is a robot in a way that can fill out a full episode without getting tedious. I will admit that Mr. Krabs was cheap and decided to give Pearl his nearly drained out batteries as a Christmas present but that's the only wrongful thing he did in the episode.

# Ending

What I need to point out here is that there are some endings from even pre-movie SpongeBob where the ending doesn't make sense e.gs. The Chaperone and MM&BB IV but they're meant to be gags so I can see where the writers were coming from. In The Chaperone, it's revealed that Pearl just went to the prom with a mannequin of SpongeBob which can somehow move and talk, and all of Bikini Bottom is smaller than Plankton in MM&BB IV even though just before SpongeBob was much taller than Bikini Bottom. However in Krab Borg it doesn't end with a gag, let alone in the same way as the other two. SpongeBob and Squidward are purposely destroying Mr. Krabs, their employers', belongings which doesn't really make it a gag. One idea that could have worked would be if Squidward and SpongeBob destroy the blender and then bring out the cash register where Krabs starts crying and then after realizing he isn't a robot and SpongeBob reveals how the movie ended, Squidward is glad they only destroyed the blender but SpongeBob reveals he destroyed everything else like the coffee maker which is to be a gag. Then the episode ends as it does.

For me, SpongeBob, our hero, who roped Squidward into this whole thing, is just as guilty for his actions as Squidward. If it was the other way around or SpongeBob expressed doubts that Mr. Krabs wasn't a robot but Squidward didn't listen then I could excuse him fleeing. A better ending would be if SpongeBob tripped over his shoes (a callback to Your Shoe's Untied) when he tried to flee leaving him and Squidward stuck in Mr. Krabs' office with him growling at them then that would have made for a satisfying ending. Or, the scene then cut to SpongeBob and Squidward tightly compacted in a robot costume until they paid off the money they owed him that attracted many customers and Mr. Krabs joked that he should make them do this all the time. SpongeBob then vows he will never watch another scary movie again.

Stupid question but: what do I do with a partner?,"As a brief summary, I can't say what I do for my career but it's a technical job that's very fulfilling and interesting to me. Outside of that I'm going to be volunteering for a crisis hotline soon. Once I get adjusted to that, I want to get back into Judo as well. I'm about halfway to black belt and I would love to finish that arc. The thrill of a Judo match is so much fun too; grabbing someone and slamming them into Earth, grappling with them...there's just nothing like it. The combination of grace and power is so compelling. I'm also gonna dabble in improv comedy, that's also something I used to do and I want to get back into it.

These are all things I need to do on my own, there's no way for a potential partner to fit into these ambitions. So if I were to date, I don't understand what to do with a partner that would be worthwhile for me and for them. What do I do; get coffee for the 100th time? Play another board game?

I want to go hike there and see if we can find fossils too."" But that's not a date. So what are some exciting dates I can suggest that won't get me rejected?

Maybe that was why i flirted in rebellion— your eyes or perhaps the beautiful hazel of your eyes, an excuse to see how far things can go, how far you'll let things go.
Looking at you with inviting eyes and a teasing smile when I should've looked up to you with respect and never invitation, asking you about your likes and dislikes when I should've asked about relevant shit and advice on things in your expertise, talking to you till 3 am, teasing you about how i can sleep in class in the daytime unlike you— things escalated pretty quickly. Forbidden things always taste good. The idea of you wanting me, falling for me felt so fucking good, empowering, and maybe that's why I couldn't stop. I couldn't stop talking to you, texting you all night, looking at you, getting extra ready in the morning and smiling at you knowing how you'll tell me i looked beautiful when you'd finally text me at night. 

You are addictive. That's exactly what I said to you and then you warned me how addictions are never good. I wittily responded how i smoke even though I know it'll fuck up my lungs so I'll be here and knowingly invite a heartbreak. You said you'll try to make it less painful for me when the time comes and i changed the topic to cofree because that's the only thing you truly love other than yourself. You're a conceited, selfish asshole and maybe that's what pulled me to you. Exchanging glances turned to exchanging books and texts changed  into voice notes. Goodness me, your voice. I could listen to you all day. The raspy voice and how you word things out and your fucking poems and sonnets and how recite it for everyone and how i get jealous because it isn't only for me. But when your eyes find me at the end when everyone's busy applauding and you look at me with that devilish smile and for a fucking second, the world disappears and you blush and look away. You are an absolute beauty, tragic how you are not for me to keep.
Conversations went on and you invited me for coffee, I joked about not wanting to third wheel between you and your only love but you said it wouldn't be a competition but two of your favourite things would be with you together and it would feel good. That was the moment I knew i was falling and i should take a step back. I did not.

When you asked me if I missed you after not talking for an entire day and i said I did, you called me a liar because i didn't text you and i said i was scared that you wouldn't respond with the same enthusiasm and I would feel rejected. You said i was in your heart and I called you a liar and you corrected the statement to me being in your memories. Should've understood then and there that I'd never actually own your heart, a part in it maybe, but never all of it.

When I told you how your eyes look ethereal when you wear the blue shirt, you said you'll never wear it again. I called you cruel because i loved to see you in it and you said how you're making things easier for me because if I could find it beautiful, somebody else would too. I laughed it off then but it's been weeks and I haven't seen you in that shirt and i miss you.

I ended things a couple days ago, you keep on trying to reach out and talk, understand why I am suddenly so far and I don't give you an answer. You find excuses to send texts, photos of sunrise because i mentioned how they make me feel better about everything, books you gave to me, dishes you were supposed to cook for me, your handwriting and random poems from your collection— anything and everything that could make me talk to you. But I don't. And you give up. 

We don't talk anymore. I don't look at you anymore. When you wore the blue shirt, you looked at me again and again, hoping I'd look and smile maybe, I don't.

It's 2 am and the typing indicator is showing me how you've been typing and deleting shit for an hour straight. I should sleep. I miss you. I'm sorry I broke your heart. I broke mine too.

1pfxym4,https://i.redd.it/t5194u77zm5g1.png,"designers are calling it ""vibe designing"" and it's actually solving the problem nobody talks about","Been watching design communities and noticed something. People keep mentioning ""vibe designing"" and at first I thought it was just hype around vibe coding. But it's different and honestly addresses a real problem.

**The problem nobody admits**

Traditional design teams have this weird gap. PM has one vision of how something should feel. Designer has another. Founder has a third. Everyone's working from different mental models about what the product actually is emotionally.

Nobody's aligned on the vibe. So you get endless revision cycles of ""make it feel more premium"" or ""this doesn't feel right"" without anyone defining what that actually means.

**What vibe designing actually is**

Teams create a ""vibe lexicon"" first. Everyone builds from the same emotional vocabulary and visual references before touching Figma.

Someone ran an experiment with Figma AI. Asked for four prototype variations of a coffee shop app. Same structure, same content. Four completely different vibes.

Clean minimal with tight spacing. Warm cozy with textures and hand-drawn accents. Modern energetic with bold typography. Premium calm with whitespace.

Same header. Same featured drink section. Same menu. Same nav bar.

But they felt like completely different products.

**Why this matters**

It flips the workflow. Usually you lock in one direction, build it out, show users, get feedback, iterate.

Vibe designing generates multiple directions upfront. You test what resonates emotionally before committing resources.

**The practical part**

Teams drop in reference images, URLs, sketches, voice notes, user metrics. Everything shapes what AI generates. Then load it with brand guides, design tokens, examples of ""the right vibe.""

Blurs traditional roles. Designers spin up functional UI fast without waiting on devs. Devs tweak visuals without touching Figma. PMs describe how they want something to feel instead of pixel-level feedback.

Collins Dictionary picked ""vibe coding"" as Word of the Year 2025. Concept started with Andrej Karpathy describing developers ""embracing the vibes, ignoring technical intricacies, focusing on essence."" Designers adapted it to UI.

**The handoff changes**

Deliverable shifts from spec document to ready-to-use interactive components. User researchers test functional prototypes faster. Iterate by describing new ideas instead of waiting for another design cycle.

AI supposedly combs through user feedback and session data, spits out insights. Teams iterate based on data rather than guesses.

**What I keep hearing**

The problem is teams using completely different mental models of what the product should feel like. Vibe designing creates that alignment first. Everything else follows.

Not seeing posts saying this solved everything. But everyone's saying it changed how they think about design handoff and how they present options to non-designers.

Has anyone actually integrated this into workflow?

Does the multiple variation approach help teams pick better directions or just create more options faster?",2,1765049903.0,CreatorsAI,1,1.0,False

1pfxv3p,https://i.redd.it/qt78dtqtym5g1.jpeg,Meet Bambi Michelle 💕,"TLDR; 6+ months out of black hole research, videos, following the sub. I made a choice: Bambino Plus & Baratza (not shown, waiting for package). 

After way too many sleepless nights obsessing over espresso research, I finally listened to the sub and went with the Bambino Plus + Baratza ESP (grinder still on the way). She’s just getting started, but I can already see the vision. Now I just need to figure out where to get great beans and all the matching accessories. 

My biggest pain points of indecision were:
1. Quality Build - buy it nice buy it twice
2. ADHD - my mornings look different each day
3. Effort - similar to #2 I just need my coffee I don’t care about tasting floral notes 
4. Saving money - No more ashtray Sbux drinks
5. Organic Coffee - I’m a health nut and went as extreme as researching PFAS, Plastics used, Organic Coffee farms - then after making myself sick from rabbit hole I decided if this is what takes me out then so be it. 
6. Aesthetics - I’m just a girl, I want something that looks nice on the counter that I can easily move around and decorate around. 
7. I hate noise so really wanted a quiet grinder and I’m fine not counting every bean BUT everything is back ordered so trying Baratza route first. 

Didn’t check every box but seems to be the perfect upgrade from Nespresso. Depending on how this journey evolves I’d wind up with an Oracle Jet or Ascaso, it can go either way. I purchased Illy pre ground  just to test it out and that was a huge flop (still cleaning particles out of my eyes and nose). 

Many more questions to come, will need all the help I can get as I was planning to be this consumed by my morning cup. Thanks for all the help! ",3,1765049654.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1pfxuv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pfxuv1/i_started_a_government_job_in_a_mine_and/,"I Started a Government Job in a Mine, and Something’s Not Right","I signed the NDA and showed up for orientation, but something about the whole setup didn’t sit right with me. The pay was sky-high, the requirements absurdly minimal, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d stumbled into something… off. I kept telling myself it was just excitement, just desperation — but deep down, I wondered if I’d been chosen for a reason I didn’t understand.  
So, a little context on how I even got this job — and why I can’t just walk away.  
 Forty-eight dollars an hour for something so mundane should’ve been a no-brainer, but I know nothing easy comes without a price. The mine had been shut down for over twenty years. Hell, my father was fired when it closed. Last week, out of nowhere, it reopened.

When I saw the pay, the minimal requirements, and the fact that they were hiring immediately, I didn’t look a gift horse in the mouth. I applied, and somehow — unbelievably — I got the job.

The interview went like this:

“Mr. Grady, why do you want this job?”

“Well, I haven’t had income for eleven months, and I have a 4-month-old at home.”

“When can you start?”

“Monday?”

“Welcome aboard. Monday morning, 8 a.m. You’ll get orientation and your suit then.”

“Suit?”

“Monday morning.”

“Your sign-on bonus will be sent to your bank on Monday night. Fifteen hundred dollars. Write your deposit information.”

And that was it.  
 The interviewer seemed rushed, like he was checking boxes, not hiring a person. I’ve never felt so much like a quota in my life. 

But this quota just got a new job and money on Monday! 



I went home to Maggie and Shaun to tell them the good news.  
 He’s only 4 months old, and I swear he could start talking any day. There’s such intelligence in those hazel eyes.  
 Maggie, in her usual fashion, seemed focused on sketching, what I can only assume is an illustration of our cat trying to get away from the baby, while Shaun lay in the playpen, stretching his tiny nub fingers toward it.

Our home is a house my father left me in his will. It’s the only thing of real value he gave me. He had his drinking issues after the mine closed, so being a father wasn’t as important to him as the bar.

But we made this our home. There’s a warmth here that I find comforting — seeing my son try to reach the cat, hearing it purr like a vibrating phone, and watching my wife smile as she sketches the scene. I’d seen this little scene countless times over the last eleven months, always coming home feeling like a failure after interviews that didn’t go my way.  
 This time was different.  
 I came home and felt like a hero.

As soon as I stepped inside, Maggie stopped what she was doing.

“WELL! How did it go??”

I tried to play coy, put on a show like there might be bad news, but my smile gave me away like a flashlight in the woods. I chuckled with excitement.

“I start Monday.”

“Oh, Alan! That’s ama—”

I didn’t let her finish. I wanted to hug her. We held each other for what felt like an eternity, her head on my chest, the sound of my cooing son nearby.



The feeling of our cat brushing against us was icing on the cake.

This was the best feeling I’d had in a long time.

Not since that Monday morning… or maybe it all seemed so distant since that very first day.

  
  
  


Monday morning came, and you best believe I was the first one in that mobile office trailer. Fresh coffee in hand, sitting at a table, I expected to see someone by 8 a.m. 

I’d gotten there eager and an hour early, 

but the longer I waited,

 the more I realized it was just, myself with three other men.

For a mine shaft. You’d think they’d need at least twenty people. Back when my dad worked there, he was with fifty men in that same mine.

Then, before I could even spark up a conversation, our interviewer walked in, folder in hand, smiling widely.

 He pulled out an old-style projector, set it up, and killed the lights.



The projector flickered to life. 

The screen was almost **too bright**, colors saturated, with the logo of the project spinning cheerfully in the corner: **Project Deep Core**. 

A perfect circle, like a cross-section of the Earth. 

The outer ring was a dark, industrial gray, the mantle a deep red-orange gradient that seemed to glow just slightly. 

At the center was the core itself, bright yellow, almost too bright, and right in the middle were the bold letters: **PDC**.

A voice boomed, almost sing-songy, like it was straight out of a government training commercial. The humming of the projector and fanfare playing almost made it seem like a fun cartoon to watch, if not for the unsettling feeling in my stomach.



“Welcome to the PDC, we are happy partners with the United States of America, to ensure our citizens have a bright and safe future!”  
  
“Mining has been an industrial staple for Americans for generations, and now we bring it back for a new purpose: to assist our new *fully automated extraction system*. It will do the hard work, you just need to be safe in doing so!” 

I stared at the imagery as it shifted, showing five Rules, each bolded and seemingly just as important as the last. I inched closer in my seat, trying to memorize every word; I couldn’t afford to mess up on my first day.



# Rule 1 — Suit Safety

“Before entering the mine, ensure your PDC-issued protective suit is **fully sealed and intact**.  
 Follow the illustrated taping technique for gloves and boots to maintain an **airtight barrier**.

**Do not remove ventilation components while in the mine.**  
 If *any* part of your suit becomes torn, punctured, or compromised, proceed immediately to **Rule 4 protocols**.”

(Cartoon worker happily tapes his boots while a second cartoon worker waves despite an obviously smoking tear in his suit.)





# Rule 2 — Communication Line Integrity

“To keep you connected, each team member is equipped with a chest-mounted communications patch.

Before entering the mine, replace all walkie batteries and test the line.  
 Press the marked indentation on the chest patch to speak.

**DO NOT remove communication cords during a mine run.**  
 **DO NOT attempt to unfasten or extract the radio during operation.**”

(An illustrated worker demonstrates plugging in a cable, smiling even as sparks fly from another worker’s headset.)





# Rule 3 — Group Tether Compliance

“All crew members must remain connected to their designated **lead tether line** at all times.  
 Check your harness clips regularly. Never detach yourself or another worker from the group tether for *any reason*.”

(Animation shows four workers clipped together, bouncing happily down a dark tunnel that seems to breathe.)





# Rule 4 — Emergency Tether Protocol

“In the event of danger, suit breach, communication failure, or disorientation, activate the **Emergency Tether Crank System**.

Hold down the lever and press the red emergency button located beside the master crank.  
 Remain braced and hold tight — the tether will automatically **retract you back to the entrance**.”

(Animation shows a smiling worker being yanked backward at high speed while another cartoon miner waves goodbye.)





# Rule 5 — Terminal Confirmation Button

“At the end of every mine run, proceed to the **Terminal Marker Station**.  
 Press the illuminated **Confirmation Button** firmly to complete your route.”

“After pressing the button, wait for the PDC Impactor System to confirm your run:”

1. **Low mechanical rumble** — “System waking.”  
2. **Sharp metallic strike** — “Alignment confirmed.”  
3. **Deep resonance through the walls** — “Impactor cycle complete.”  

“Do not leave until all three sounds have been heard.  
 Failure to complete this step may result in **incomplete logs**…  
 and an **automatic recall of your tether group**.”

(Friendly worker gives a thumbs up as the walls behind him quietly shudder.)

Just like that, the lights flickered back on, and the image from the projector burned into my eyes. I, along with what I could only assume were three other hired men, stood up—either out of seeing the others do it, or from a small shock as the door opened. A small-statured man entered, wearing the same type of suit we’d seen in the training cartoons… only now it was real.   
  
“Hello, everyone. I am Dr. Malcolm.”

His voice sounded… off. It reminded me of a foreign actor I couldn’t place, thinner and stretched somehow, and that bothered me more than the suit. 

“These are your hazmat suits, please gentlemen, follow me we have a small locker room and equipment shed located inside the mine.”  
nervously  
“Un… deux… trois… quatre…

Un… deux… trois… quatre…

Gloves and boots, tight and sure, Four wraps make the suit secure.”

  
This song echoed as Dr. Malcolm wrapped his suit, and then he sang it each time we wrapped our own. In a matter of a few minutes, the song was stuck in my brain, like an annoying nursery rhyme.

 These three strangers and I were taped up, suited up, and now we had our tethers to secure.

I stared down at my rope and the latch I had. My suit was **number 3**, and I was looking at the indentation described in the training video.

As Dr. Malcolm checked it, I heard a **click** and the sound of someone else breathing. Then another click, another breath. And one more click.

At that moment, I realized I was hearing the sounds of my fellow co-workers—the subtle differences in their breathing, the small sighs, the clearing of throats. The static made my head feel like it would explode.

Then Dr. Malcolm pressed a knob visible on the outside of our hazmat headpiece. And just like that, the voices stopped.

“There. I made it so you press to speak. You shouldn’t hear anything until people press the button. Go ahead, press the button to speak. If anything is too loud, you can lower the gain. There’s a knob on the right side of your helmet.”

I looked around nervously and pressed the button  
“Uh, hi, my name is Alan.” 

The man in the suite number 2 presses his button. 

“Sam.”



The man in the suit numbered 1. Presses their button  
  
“Mike”



I watched the man in suit 4 as they were still getting the last boot tapped on and  tiredly pressed their button while being hunched over.   
  
“Ennnnrh my name… iss... Benny!” He said as he, just now, triumphantly got his suit fully on. With both arms in the air, now showing victory. 

 We marched into the mine,

 Mike attached the emergency latch to the entrance as Dr. Malcolm had instructed.

 We followed him like sheep being led to pasture. 

Our boots squelching under the soft almost mud, but not quite ground. 

We were all approaching what seemed to be a small electric golf cart. With extra seats in tow.   
The deeper we went, the squelch of our boots sounded unnaturally loud.

That tape song hummed behind me — or maybe inside my own head.

I looked them over one by one while we each sat in the golf cart, getting settled in to drive deeper into the mine. 

Mike number 1, he has the emergency latch, 

tethered to Sam number 2, 

and then tethered to me number 3,

 and then Benny number 4. 

  
I was nervous being first in, but I wouldn’t want to be the last either. 

As the darkness of the mine swallowed us, the main thought occurred to me, reassuring myself, at least we are not alone.

1pfxs64,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pfxs64/tips_for_newcomers/,Tips for newcomers!,"Hi friends, I’ve recently entered the lovely world of espresso and just wanted to share some tips I’ve learned along the way. Hopefully this post can help some newbies who might be struggling.

1. TASTE - By far the number one most important thing to consider when making espresso is TASTE! It sounds silly and obvious, but when first starting out you will be bombarded with information regarding ratios, extraction timing, equipment, techniques, aesthetics, etc. and it will be easy to get overwhelmed. Do not lose sight of the main goal: a good tasting cup of espresso! Don’t be afraid to bend the “rules.” Trust your senses. Social media will try to convince you your espresso should look and act a certain way. Don’t fall for it. If it tastes good, then you are doing something right. At the end of the day, taste is a preference and unique to the individual.

Spend some time learning your preferences and refining your taste. Try espresso at different coffee shops to get an idea of what type of beans and roast level you prefer. Origin and roast level will have significant impacts on flavor. Avoid supermarket beans as these are often old and stale. Opt for fresh beans from local roaster that are about a week or two post roast. Learn the difference between sour and bitter, as these can be often confused and are super important to be able to identify when dialing in your extraction.

2. EQUIPMENT - You are going to see a lot of different pieces of equipment on this sub. Do your research before whipping out that credit card. You do NOT need to spend thousands of dollars to make good tasting espresso at home. In my opinion (and I think most would agree), the most important piece of equipment is the GRINDER. Being able to get a consistent, repeatable grind is key to properly dialing in, as grind size is one of the most important factors in the extraction process. Espresso machines, at their core, all operate the same way. They use pressure to force heated water through the grinds to extract espresso. Higher end models will have some nice additional features, but none of them are really necessary for beginners. If you are under a tight budget, it’s almost always better to splurge on a good grinder rather than an expensive espresso machine. It is much easier to achieve good tasting espresso with a high end grinder and a basic espresso machine rather than vice versa. 

Aside from the grinder and espresso machine, you will encounter a myriad of tools, gadgets, and doohickeys. Do not fret! Some of these can be helpful, but most are not necessary. The only truly necessary items are a scale (with 0.1g accuracy) and a good tamper. Doesn’t have to be an expensive scale, a cheap one will do fine. A self-leveling tamper can be really helpful for beginners who have a hard time achieving a consistently level tamp. While not directly necessary for extraction, tools like a dosing funnel and puck screen can significantly improve the cleanliness and make your life easier. WDT tools can help reduce channeling and improve consistency from shot to shot. Everything else is just fluff, in my opinion. But if you are really into the hobby and have the financial freedom, go ahead and collect all the gizmos your heart desires! 

3. DIALING IN EXTRACTION - Now this is by far the most difficult part for beginners. If you are looking to just press a button and get espresso, you are in the wrong place (go buy a Nespresso!). Dialing in takes patience and practice. There are several different variables that can affect your extraction, so be scientific and adjust only ONE variable at a time while keeping everything else constant. If you change multiple variables at once, it will be impossible to know which one caused the effect. Start with a common recipe like “18g in, 36g out, 30 sec.” This means grind 18g of beans and extract out 36g of liquid in about 30 seconds. Remember this is a rough guideline, not gospel. You can absolutely achieve good tasting espresso outside of these parameters. This is just a starting point to help you get a baseline, then you can tweak variables and note the differences.

It all starts with good, consistent puck prep. Make sure there are no clumps in your grinds and your tamp is nice and evenly level. This will help prevent channeling. Pull your shot and take notes. If it flows out too quickly and tastes sour, try grinding finer. If it flows out too slowly and tastes bitter, try grinding coarser. Once you hit the sweet spot, your taste buds will know. Remember, taste is paramount! The dialing in process takes time and is unique to each bean, so be patient and don’t get discouraged. A dark roast from Brazil will require completely different parameters than a light roast from Ethiopia. 

One day, everything will click into place and you will have produced a delicious cup of espresso. Cheers!

I’m 26F, looking for a partner to navigate life while having fun. This is an alt account because my other one has my IRL friends.

I’m from Chennai, but have lived in Delhi before. I’m telugu, but know Tamil & Hindi as well.

Posting on here as last resort because dating apps have been a bad experience for me and I’m one step away from taking up my aunt’s offer to move to SFO, and meet guys working in her husband’s company.

Some important points - Eggetarian, I don’t smoke, but consume wine occasionally.

Here’s something about me:

1. On work - My day job is in Operations, its a remote role. I have two side quests currently - one of which is building Ops for a US based creative agency and the 2nd one has me talking to founders fundraising, evaluating their pitch decks and mentally screaming bruh how can you make $600K ARR with a lean team of 5 people and not know how to make a proper pitch deck. So I like my work, money is decent (again decent is perspective), and I get to have work life balance. 🧿 (Nazar is real guys, so shooing away all negative energy)

2. I have high functioning ADHD, and this just means I have like 94 tabs open in my brain always. And I keep switching between golden retriever energy to a black cat, annoyed with people, it mostly depends on what stage of my cycle I am on, but I am still learning. I am also a big - let me check my calendar person, because adhd makes it draining to remember stuff and adding things, even small stuff, to the calendar helps with my mental load.

3. I am an ENFJ, if that helps. My therapist recommended I add that although I have no idea why, because I think personalities can be different and you can still hit off if value systems align.

4. Why CF: I don't think I'll ever be ready to have kids, and I more or less want the generational trauma to end with me. I could never imagine myself to be a mother frankly speaking. It is not to say that I believe I'm unfit or a bad human being, I just don’t have the maternal instinct in me. I don't think I'll ever be ready for another whole human being of my own. I think you can't be a good parent till you're emotionally fully healed, too and I am not sure if I'll ever reach the threshold. And besides, kids? In this economy? Please.

5. My non negotiables: a) A kind man with good emotional competence (EQ) who can move through life with grace. There are going to a lot of tough moments in life and I’m looking for someone who is emotionally intelligent enough to understand this and can handle the curveballs life throws at us with grace. b) Financially literate with an abundant mindset - and I dont mean in terms of a number, but more of a mentality where he’s focused and ambitious about his own career progression. c) And someone who also has a personality outside of work - someone who has his own hobbies, and habits to fill his own cup. But also someone who despite whatever number of hours he’s putting at work, can set up time to unwind and connect with me, even if it means 15 mins. d) Aged between 26-28, 29 is a stretch but we can work with it. e) I’m 5’5 so someone taller than that.

6. Amongst other things, I have a straight up obsession with ghee podi dosa and filter coffee. So if you like either of them, brownie points.

7. Also if you are hitting me up, do not ask me what I want to do with life, because first of all, I dont know the answer to that question. Let me clear that up right away. And second of all, if you have a solid answer and clarity on that - colour me impressed. But if you still want to know, the theme is to make crazy money, stay healthy, travel, and have a peaceful life.

8. I like to read a lot - econ, politics, tech, psych - all of it, so a conversation partner would be great. FWIW, my insta feed is cool and interesting so I’ll definitely be sending you a lot of reels and VN yapping away.

9. I am also a spiritual person. Not religious, but spiritual and it is important for me that you understand the distinction. I have never kept a fast or done any of those don’t cut nails on Thursday thing ever, but you will find me visiting temples and praying a lot. I took a trip to Rameshwaram this year, and its been one of the most memorable moments I had in life, was lucky enough to even go on a private tour of the temple. So I am looking for someone who would love to visit LA, Thailand and Somnath with the same enthusiasm and is on the same wavelength as me.

10. I am also a pet parent to an adorable female lab and she’s literally the love of my life.

11. I love movies like every other person out there, and do them constantly every month, but of late, I have been leaning towards Disney movies more? The feel good ones and its been ages since I last saw a regional flick in the theatre. I mean I loved watching final destination and jurassic world but had to leave halfway through a regional flick because, the hell is wrong with cinema these days man?? The plot made no sense. Apologies for the rant, but its important that you know this is the kind of person I am. Also I loved Zootopia 2 so so much, why do we women keep falling for fictional men, sigh.

12. Last, I am a bit of a grammar nazi so if you type like a 5th grader on meth, I am not continuing the conversation.

13. And if we are in a different city, but hit off well, I dont mind visiting and setting up a base to see if things work out.

Am I asking for too much? I think your partner should be a reflection of how much you love yourself, and I love myself a whole lot, as simple as that. Compatibility > perfection. If we vibe, we vibe.

Help me manifest someone, you lovely CF people.

After being laid off from my job, my friend and I built an agency. Mostly we deliver websites and this is what we offer most of the time.

**Our Expenses**  
  
We use Meta ads and Veo. 3.1  and spend around 8$ per day. We get 4 to 5 messages from potential customers. We spend around 20$ for the AI tool

Our CPC is around 2$ so far and we are trying to reduce it. If someone knows Meta ads well, we are open to feedback and would actually love to hear some tips.

**What we get:**

Our first order was from Germany. It was a wellness and massage business. The owner loved the website and paid on time.

Currently we are using different artificial UGC and influencers and trying to hook our audience. We can’t complain, it is working so far.

Tomorrow, we will reach out to coffee shops that do not have websites. No idea if it will work or not.

**Result**: It is really hard to scale as a software agency, and to get leads, you really have to burn some cash.",1,1765049011.0,AiForSmallBusiness,0,1.0,False

This will have to be group effort and participation for it to happen. For an inaugural walk I would suggest a 9 or 10 a.m. start on Sunday morning. Somewhere around 8 km for the first one and end at place such as a coffee shop, bar, etc. 


Pick a walk that avoids the main roads. U of T is nice walk, then over to Queens Park and on from there or something like Mt.Pleasant cemetery since it is beautiful walk but not for everyone.  You want the first walk to be slow so you can chat as you walk and avoid crowded side walks.


These are just my suggestions to get the walks started. 


People have made mention they would a spur of the moment walks as well so if you are interested in that this would be a good idea to meet others and maybe meet a few others do those things with. 


December 14th is probably the best day this month to give this a try. 


Let me know what people think and if we can get enough interest we can plan for it next over next few days.

1pfxjmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1pfxjmc/was_i_assaulted/,Was I assaulted?,"I just started my new job about two weeks ago. I've been enjoying it, but something happened yesterday.

My new job consists of picking up customers and we are a business that works with other small business owners. I went to a store to pick up a customer and the owner of this small business formally introduces himself to me. Being new, I've been working on talking to all the other owners of each small business. I was trying to be friendly obviously, but he kept talking to me for a long time. I thought it was weird how the owner asked me for my phone number. I then told him that I can give our store number instead and also ask to talk to my manager regarding business inquries. He said he wasn't interested and insisted to get my phone number so he could text and call me specifically. I was too scared to reject him. I have a boyfriend, but the complication was that he was an owner and our business as a relationship with his. He then waited to make sure my phone rang once I gave my phone number. I was getting scared and I felt like I couldn't say no. I have a boyfriend and this man is probably 15 years older than me. The power dynamic threw me off. He then asked me if we can get coffee together. I laughed it off, trying to be polite. I told him I can just visit his store for marketing and talking about how we can strengthen our business relationship. But it seemed like he was insistent on getting coffee with me for other purposes. He asked if I tried any resturants and also asked me at least three times on what time I get off of work. I was getting nervous at that point. I lied and said I get off an hour later just in case he would appear at work. I asked a coworker walk me back to my car after work.

I didn't say no to any of his pursuits. But I was visibly uncomfortable, awkwardly laughing, and just trying to be polite. At this point, the customer who I came to pick up as probably been waiting there for 10 minutes. Right before he leaves, he said goodbye and then put his face on my face with a cheek kiss. I froze immediately and realized what happened. Am I overreacting? Is this assault?",3,1765048873.0,TwoXChromosomes,1,0.8,False
1pfxjb3,https://v.redd.it/fvj5c42fwm5g1,Another Cracked Lahar appreciation post,"(Don’t be alarmed by my tremor — I’ve got care for it, I just had extra coffee this morning so it’s more pronounced than usual!)

I’ve loved all of y’all’s Lahar posts, and when I found out Cracked was local, I chose them for one of my BF orders, and busted it out on arrival.

I tried a cat eye on my thumb and pinky and they’re very diffuse. I used the Cracked magnet under on my index finger and over on my middle finger and I don’t see much difference. I used the round end of my wand to try to push a glass bead on my ring fingers (that’s the finish I ultimately like best — I’m going to try some of the pin-prick glass bead methods next time I use it, as an experiment).

Photos and videos just don’t do this polish justice. It’s worth the hype. I’m glad I’m not driving today, since I wouldn’t be able to keep my eyes on the road.

Also, I’m super impressed… Cracked nailed my motorcycle race team’s brand colors better than our screen printer can — my nails are more “on brand” than our merch!

1 x Cracked Sticky base coat
3 x Cracked Lahar (magnetized coats 2 & 3 per above notes)
1 x Cracked Quick Dry Top Coat. 

Haven’t done cuticle clean-up yet. I will say — the formula and brush are my HG so far. I have trouble loading brushes enough with one dip to cover the sides of my nails — I prefer to be able to do 3-4 careful swipes from cuticle to tip to fill a nail without pooling. Some of the other magnetics I’ve tried load the brush more so there is more polish to work with, but it isn’t as spreadable so I wind up missing spots especially on the tip sides of my nail (I have a strong c-curve) and have to double dip leading to bumpy or too-thick finishes. 

This brush/formula combo was perfect. One dip, full nail coverage, nicely buildable. 

After my BF orders (Cracked, Fancy, and an unplanned order from u/Mkheir01 ‘s Etsy thanks to their Phthalo Green experiment the other night) I’m on a no-buy… but I am so glad I picked this one up. It’s truly gorgeous.

Trading at ~$0.23 today (mkt cap ~$95M), it’s down 71% YTD but with insane vol (202% annualized) and volume spikes that scream “short squeeze potential.”
I’ve dug deep: Pulled daily prices back to Jan ‘25, scanned news/X/Reddit sentiment, and even sim’d some paths. This ain’t financial advice – DYOR, it’s a lotto ticket with teeth. But if defense budgets balloon $BURU could 3-5x by EOY. 



Quick Company Primer: What Even Is Nuburu?

•  Core Tech: Blue diode lasers for high-precision welding. Why blue? Deeper penetration on reflective metals like copper/aluminum – game-changer for EV batteries, aerospace, and defense (think drone frames, missile casings).

•  Pivot Story: Started in coffee pods (yep, single-serve weirdness), but post-2023 rebrand, it’s all-in on industrial/defense lasers. HQ in Centennial, CO; ~50 employees.

•  Market Tailwinds: Global laser market to $25B by 2030 (CAGR 12%). Defense slice? Exploding with US DoD’s $850B budget and EU’s €15M Tekne program for photonics.

From Reddit DDs (shoutout u/pennystockguru’s Sep post): “Tiny laser/defense penny with NATO ties – not garbage, real IP.”


Key Trend : Steady bleed Jan-Sep ($0.80 → $0.14), then Oct explosion (volume 10x avg, price 5x) on defense news. Nov pullback, but Dec vol up 20%. Cash? Recent filings show ~$10M post-raise, enough for ops but dilution watch (S-3 active).
No debt bombs (paid $4M note Oct), but burn rate ~$2M/Q – runway to mid-2026 if rev ramps.



Catalyst: Aquisition Streak + JV fire works !

Lyocon Acquisition (Closed Dec 1): Snagged Italian photonics firm for $2M ($0.5M cash + $1.5M deferred). Adds blue-laser R&D for defense apps. Ties to €15M Tekne program – EU defense grants incoming? 
[Source: StockTitan, 5 days ago]

Maddox Defense JV (By Dec 15): Binding term sheet for controlling interest in drone tech JV. Focus: Next-gen blue-laser guided drones. If finalized, rev share + IP cross-pollination. X buzz: ""BURU + drones = moonshot."" 
[OTC Markets]

Earnings/Updates: Q3 report due mid-Dec; whispers of 20% YoY rev growth from laser sales. NYSE compliance deadline Dec 31 – beat it, and uplist vibes.

Macro: US defense budget +$50B proposed; blue lasers key for hypersonics. Reddit thread: ""Only way up Q4 – re-rate to $1+?""



Sentiment Scan:

Reddit: 80% bullish in r/pennystocks DDs (e.g., ""Tekne status: Green light""). Dilution FUD in comments, but ""already baked in.""
X/Twitter: 70% promo spam, but real alpha on acquisitions (20+ posts last week, min 50 faves on squeeze calls).

Shorts: 32% interest dropping – covering if $0.30 breaks.


Technicals: Chart Says ""Coiled Spring""

Price action? Classic penny runner: Sideways grind → vol spike → fade → reload.

Line chart of closes (last 30 trading days, Nov-Dec). Shows Nov bottom at $0.20, Dec bounce on Lyocon news.


Risks: Not All Lasers Are Created Equal

Dilution Devil: S-3 shelf reg open – could flood shares. Reddit: ""Diluted pre-announce, watch filings.""
Compliance Crunch: NYSE warning Oct '25 for low price/equity. Fix by Dec or delist risk.
Execution Fumble: Acqs sound hot, but integration delays? Small cap = mgmt roulette.
Market Mood: Broader penny dump on rate hikes could drag.

Position? I'm in small (5% port) for the lotto – stop at $0.18.

TL;DR & Thesis

Bull Case: $BURU = Undervalued defense disruptor. Lyocon + Maddox JV = rev catalyst city. Shorts at 32% + vol = squeeze setup. PT: $0.75 EOY (3x), $2 '26 on contracts.

Bear Case: Dilution + vol = bagholder central.

Worth a nibble? Hell yeah, if you love lasers (pun intended). 

What's your take – loading up or passing?

Early testers report it handles multi-stop trips, landmark searches, and last-minute detours far better than the old voice system. This update makes long drives and daily commutes noticeably smoother because everything happens through simple conversation.

I remember the silence first. The whole street looked hollow, like the world had been scraped clean. My thoughts felt the same—blank, empty. But the feeling of being watched kept jabbing at my nerves.

I checked behind me.

Nothing.

Just that miserable stretch of asphalt.

The second I turned forward again, hands clamped around me. I didn’t even have time to shout. They dragged me across the pavement toward a peeling apartment door. I knew what was coming. It had already happened. Many times.

The three men said nothing. The first one raised a gun, as casual as lighting a cigarette. He put the barrel to my forehead.

The shot didn’t hurt at first. It burned. I felt metal glide through my skull and fry whatever softness lived inside my brain. I collapsed, locked in my own body, drowning in the warmth of my own blood. I couldn’t scream. Couldn’t move. I just died quietly, suffocating in myself.

Then I woke up.

Sweaty. Gasping.

For a full second, I wasn’t sure which world was real.

I went through my morning routine: shower, coffee, food.

Everything tasted wrong.

Everything felt wrong.

And every morning the same question gnawed at me:

Why do I feel my own death so clearly?

\--

**November 15th, 2029**

Sleep came slowly—four hours of preparation, breathing exercises, trying not to think about dying again. Then the dream snapped into place.

I was in a home I didn’t recognise, in the middle of an argument with a woman who felt like a wife I’d forgotten. We weren’t speaking the same language; she yelled, I said nothing.

I don’t know why I reached into the couch cushion and pulled out a knife. I don’t know why I felt like I was about to use it.

Before I could move, she stormed back into the room holding a gun. The look in her eyes wasn’t human.

She aimed. Fired.

Same spot. Same numb collapse.

Two dreams in a row—same death.

But this time I didn’t wake up.

This time I kept lying there, bleeding out, growing colder. My vision dimmed slowly, like someone lowering a lantern. Somewhere behind me, gravel crunched under footsteps.

An old man sat down beside me.

“Mind if I join you, young man?”

I woke up already sitting upright, shaking violently, like something had yanked me back into my body.

\--

**January 7th, 2030**

Two months since I saw him.

I know he was real.

Nothing in dreams ever sounds real—their physics are wrong, their voices hollow.

But his feet on the gravel were solid. Heavy. Alive.

I haven’t dreamt since.

\--

**April 23rd, 2030**

Five months of peaceful darkness.

No death. No waking up screaming.

My days felt long but bearable. I got work done. I felt human again.

Then I closed my eyes tonight, hoping for more darkness.

But I forgot falling asleep.

The dream swallowed me instantly.

A park.

Empty. Silent.

No sun. No moon. Just a dull glow leaking from the sky.

And behind me:

“Come sit down, my child.”

The old man’s face was wrong this time. Rotting. Skin crawling with tiny pale worms. His voice dripped honey and filth.

“Sit, cutie,” he whispered. “It’ll all be over soon.”

I managed to speak this time. “What the fuck is this?”

He looked almost bored.

“Do you really enjoy dying?”

“…sometimes,” I admitted without understanding why.

He studied me for a long, punishing silence.

“You know you can make it permanent, right?""

I suddenly woke up coughing blood.

\--

**May 1st, 2030**

Ten days awake.

No sleep.

Hallucinations crawling on the walls.

I can’t stay awake anymore.

I’ll die for real if I try.

Tonight I’m going back in.

The candles help. The breathing helps. I fall asleep in an hour.

The park again.

A shadow figure on the swing set.

Ignoring me.

Then the old man appeared at my side, like he’d always been sitting there.

“You know you can end everything anytime,” he murmured.

“That’d kill me.”

“Exactly.”

He pulled out a gun and shot me point-blank.

The bullet turned to ash on my forehead, but I still felt it tunnel through my mind—just for a fraction.

“So what’s the point?” I asked, trembling.

“To experience what I have. For the next five hundred years or so.”

My stomach knotted. “You’re insane.”

“I did it,” he said. “So can you.”

Two men with rifles walked out of the trees.

He didn’t warn me.

They both shot through my body.

The bullets ripped through my organs and pushed them aside, massive clots escaping my torso.

Every second of it was pure.

\--

**May 2nd, 2030**

I’m becoming like him.

A masochist of the worst kind.

Tonight I end it.

I fall asleep already gripping the decision in my mind.

Back in the park.

“So this is the one?” the old man asked.

“Yes.” I handed him a Beretta I didn’t remember holding. “Shoot me in the head. Make it real.”

“Kid,” he sighed, “if it were that easy, I’d have left this place a millennium ago.”

My throat tightened. “So what—I’m trapped here forever?”

“No,” he said gently, almost fatherly. “We can try together.”

I raised the gun to my temple.

My hand shook so violently I thought the barrel would slip.

His rotting fingers wrapped around mine.

He pulled the trigger with me.

The bullet crawled through my skull in slow motion—warm, slicing, absolute. My brain folded around it like melting butter. I felt the moment the world let go of me.

And then—

Nothing.

Real nothing.

\--

**December 4th, 2030**

It took seven months for my body to wake up.

A chunk of my skull gone.

Half a year unable to feed myself, move right, or think clearly.

Since then, I haven’t dreamt once.

Part of me misses it.

Part of me is terrified.

Every night before sleep, I ask myself the same question:

What would’ve happened if I’d stayed in the dreams?

Tonight, as the warmth pulls me under, I hear gravel footsteps beside my bed.

I used to prefer coffee over tea, but am slowly starting to prefer tea.

We’re the same age and position and went to the same college (didn’t know each other there though). When we first met, he said he remembers seeing me before at a bar because he was actually friends with one of my friends (I have no recollection of this). He’s naturally a friendly and outgoing person, but when he’s taking to me, it just seems different. We sit near each other and he is always asking me questions about my personal life. And when I answer his questions he seems genuinely interested and is like “wow I didn’t know that about you” stuff like that. When he talks to me, he usually makes eye contact for a second and then kinda looks down.

I joined a new team at work last week, and he did a coffee order with his team and messaged me and said “it wasn’t the same without you”. Yesterday, we had a holiday party with the company. He complimented the bracelet I was wearing, but he didn’t talk to me much at the party. After, a few of us went to a bar. At the bar, he wouldn’t stop talking to me despite us being in a group. He kept asking me more questions about my life and offered to buy me a drink.

I’ve looked at those posts as well and still have questions for my setup. I’m struggling between my OCD wanting a symmetrical grid, and knowing that I need task lighting as we love to cook and use the kitchen daily. 

This is the best I could come up with so far basically the 4 “outer” led wafers as general lighting, with one also being the task light for the coffee bar cabinets (bottom left) and fridge cabinet (bottom right), and the three in front of the cabinets and oven on the right wall being task lights/general lighting. Lower cabinets are 24” deep, uppers 12” deep. Cabinet above the fridge is 27” deep.

Red are the 4” LED wafers planned at 30” out from the wall (considering 27” instead). 

I do have under cabinet LED strips going in as well to assist with task lighting and eliminate shadows on the countertops. 

Blue over the island are hanging pendants and blue over the dining room will be some sort of pendant or “chandelier” type light. 

I’m wondering if I should add an LED wafer over the center of the island in line with the other two on the left side? Any other recommendations? Do the two in the pantry on the bottom look ok being offset in such a close space?

# •Several Principles to Keep in Mind

i. This is a personal reading, not a claim of truth.

My aim is to generate meaning for myself (and maybe for you, if you find it agreeable). I’m not arguing that this is the correct interpretation, just that it’s a fruitful one.

ii. Doylist explanations are not valid Watsonian explanations**.**

It’s true that some parts of the story exist because of game design needs such as pacing. But those production reasons cannot be used to explain in-universe events. Why a sudden jump from Rank V to Rank F has to happen in specific form but not the other requires a Watsonian justification. “Do you want to tediously raise it one by one then” is not a valid narrative explanation.

iii. I will frequently use mirroring as a reading method.

Events that happen later can illuminate earlier scenes, and earlier patterns can reframe later developments. Pokémon games rarely articulate character interiority directly, so interpreting repetitions, echoes, and mirrored moments is one way to uncover deeper structure.

iv. Side Notes.

I’m too lazy to change all instance of Taunie into Taunie/Urbain because I was writing as I play, but I do mean the character that would be our rival throughout the game in general.



# •Great Rogue Mega Cover-up and Corporate Stupidity

This is the spine of everything wrong with the city.

“…It was clear he (AZ) was serious about his claims, so we began our own investigations into the matter. What we discovered was the existence of a mysterious power with the potential to trigger Rogue Mega Evolution in Lumiose City. We’ve been calling it ‘Mega Power,’ but why is it accumulating here in Lumiose? That is something our efforts still haven’t been able to answer.”—CEO Secretary Vinnie’s version regarding events two years ago during our meeting at Quasartico headquarters.

“…But when we began investigating Prism Tower to plan for repairs and improvements, we became aware of something we had not anticipated. The tower was emitting a peculiar energy. That is when we also began detecting that strange power—which we call Mega Power—in all corners of Lumiose City. At the same time, wild Pokémon were flocking to the city in droves, as if drawn to this power. And now, we have Rogue Mega Evolution… If this dire phenomenon becomes commonplace, the people will abandon Lumiose once more…”—CEO Jett when questioned by Taunie after we reached Rank B.

Yes, folks, Vinnie knows very well where Mega Power is from and there’s something to do with the Prism Tower. He basically lied to us about not knowing where things came from.

This pattern of cover-up is exactly the problem, it is true that the Prism Tower is going to berserk sooner or later with or without Quasartico’s project, but they’re actively covering things up.

“We must work in lockstep to resolve this current crisis—without the people of the city coming to realize that they were ever in any danger.”—Vinnie, again, from our meeting at Quasartico headquarters.

“Specifically, though, they (Wild Zones) are intended to prevent wild Pokémon that have undergone Rogue Mega Evolution from causing widespread damage.”—Jett, again, from the same meeting after reaching Rank B.

From Mable’s words we can see it’s the Mayor that is responsible for designating Wild Zones, so we can basically see that the Mayor and Quasartico are working in tandem to cover the whole Rogue Mega Evolution crisis from the people to prevent them wanting to flee the city.

With this desire of cover-up established, it is reasonable to suspect a hidden depth in our first formal meeting with Vinnie, let’s reread it a little.

i. We’re blocked by Dedenne guards and needed to battle before the receptionist came out to ask what were we here for.

We can look at the Corbeau episode: the two grunts at the entrance block our path, forced us to battle them despite we said we come for business. After beating them, Philipe came out, claiming we were rude and humiliated their grunts and he needed to beat us. When we reached Corbeau, Corbeau outright asked why didn’t we have bruises on us to make negotiations easier for them—i.e. there was a script. They threw the grunts at us, when that didn’t work, Philipe came out, when that also didn’t work, they just accepted the script failed.

So, Game Freak essentially set an expectation here: in this game, people block doors with reasons.

Practically speaking, putting Dedenne incapable of communication as the first line of contact to expel anyone moving close to the building also doesn’t make sense. Are they going to let Dedenne attack business partners approaching for talks, simply because they don’t recognise them?

The Dedenne are the first test arranged by Vinnie, so after we cleared it, the receptionist came out, and Vinnie followed later.

ii. Vinnie offered a special promotion match to bump us directly from Rank V to Rank F.

Doylist: No one really wants to fight every Rank anyway?

Watsonian: But why in such manner? Why not, say, hold a public event/tournament with special promotion as a reward (which is also useful for testing our strength anyway), or any other ways? Why must this form be used for the Rank skip?

Let’s look at Vinnie’s explanation for the skip first.

“(After the special Promotion Match notifications pop up in our phones) While the PC may have already received a Mega Ring, we haven’t yet had the chance to his/her fitness for taking care of Rogue Mega Evolution incidents on his/her own. And as the leader of Team MZ, Taunie, it would be more efficient if you could also receive direct updates from our team going forward.”—Vinnie

“Only a handful of people are aware of the crisis that Lumiose City now faces—including we three. While Quasartico Inc. has been providing highly ranked Trainers with Mega Rings of our making, we’ve not divulged these sensitive truths to them.”—Also Vinnie, just minutes later

So, let’s see, reaching Rank F does not necessarily receive “the truths” (and naturally related updates) from Quasartico. We also don’t need Mega rings given by Quasartico, since AZ has already given us Mega rings. Vinnie basically torpedoed the need to couple Ranks and forming a team against Rogue Mega Evolutions.

So… why the promotion again? Why can’t Vinnie just ask for a battle to test our strength if he wants? If he wants to promote us no matter what, again, is there really no other means to raise our ranks besides a special Promotion Match in secret?

The answer is simple. It’s a reward in advance, also bribe to make us remain silent for the job they latter entrust us to do.

The confidentiality is not an accident, it’s the point.

And such secret bump has consequences. is that we have been scrutinised by people.

“Everyone’s talkin’ about the Trainers who shot up the ranks in a flash. I hear about this stuff ‘cause I’m entered in the Z-A Royale myself, y’see…… Feelin’ like a big shot after yer rise in the ranks? All right, let’s show this kid!”—Tarragon.

It’s basically Pokémon’s version of “did you sleep with your manager”.

It’s also possible that Vinnie’s request for confidentiality is partially why Taunie rudely leaves SBC’s tournament—her own poor communication is another part of the reason—and that backfires horribly. Turns out our Faerie Queen in human form doesn’t take rude refusal with vague explanation of “we’re protecting the city” nicely.

This lack of explanation from the Mayor and Quasartico only makes conspiracy theories take the information vacuum.

Who knows people make theories when there’s nothing being told.

President Jett being surrounded by protestors is the natural consequence of the cover-up, and it’s hard not to say she completely doesn’t deserve it.

The plot later also hammer this point harder by having Grisham exploiting the fact that AZ didn’t reveal the whole truth to Team MZ—that we’re actually handling his mess—to try paint this atoner as deceptive.



# •Taunie is Quasartico in Human Form and that’s Planned

The problem with assuming Game Freak “screwed up” Taunie’s character is that it presupposes a “real Taunie” the story failed to present. There’s no proof that some ideal version of her exists outside what we actually see on screen. A character with a flaw isn’t automatically “bad character design,” and being “one of the team” doesn’t mean you have to be a paragon.

In my opinion, Taunie’s flaw is that she behaves and thinks more like a corporation-human instead of normal human: someone whose speech and ethics sound like a company press release: good intentions on paper, zero grip on actual consequences.

i. She always has “good intentions”, yet poor in execution, essentially typical “idea guy” in a startup company. Planning is for people like Lida, muscle is for our player character, etc. She does the “networking”, and… vibes, maybe. This also leads to her behaviour during the debt arc—the team is in debt? Sorry, but I really really have good intentions in my heart.

ii. She takes Quasartico PR responses at surface value, and doesn’t question it. “If Vinnie hasn’t share us anything regarding the cause of Rogue Mega Evolution, that means they haven’t find anything.” Regarding the conspiracy theories brewing up due to the information vacuum? “These people just won’t listen to reason!” What reason? What was offered? Indeed, even Taunie doesn’t know—She has to ask Jett later is that true after we have reached Rank B. So she claimed the other side is unreasonable—even when she herself didn’t know what is reason.

iii. She can also sometimes be very blunt, especially towards outsiders. She doesn’t care what you want to hear, she only speaks what she wants to speak, not caring does she really know what she is saying. Just like a spokesperson in a press conference. You don’t like it, Jacinthe? Your problem then. Ditto for firmly believing she absolutely read the contract and couldn’t find predatory interest clause, saying it, checking the phone—cue the surprise.

Essentially, she mostly lives in her own world, believing her own truths, and wanting to be the hero.

Such behaviour can actually be seen from Jett as well. Please recall the exchange between Corbeau and Jett.

Corbeau: “So… You there, Quasartico president lady… What that rabble was going on about—how the wild Pokémon are coming here because of Quasartico… Any truth to that?”

Jett: “First, allow me to offer my thanks for your help. And what is true is that we at Quasartico Inc. aim to make Lumiose City into a place where people and Pokémon will coexist in harmony. However, we also know it is unreasonable to simply dream we can live alongside wild Pokémon with no protections needed. Our holo-tech encloses the wild Pokémon to keep Lumiose’s people safe—though I also hope to someday remove all such wall between us.”

There is no actual “yes”, “no”, “we are still investigating” to the original question at all. It’s all “our intentions are good” PR speech—as for actual effects of actions? Don’t know. This isn’t really far from Taunie’s speaking pattern.

Does that mean Taunie has completely no depth? No. Taunie actually also has her tactful moments, but towards insiders.

When we receive Jacinthe’s invitation to the SBC meeting, both Lida and Naveen suggests Taunie should wear better when rubbing elbows with the elites to promote Hotel Z’s business.

Taunie already expressed her interests to wear her normal jacket, but she didn’t push the matter at Nouveau Café, avoiding a potential clash. Instead, she waited after we get the suit and Lida wasn’t nearby—so there’s only her, Naveen, us, and clothes designer Asami (outsider)—and explained that the jacket is her mother’s legacy, so that Asami decided that is good enough for her.

Instead of starting an emotional blackmail against Lida and Naveen in Nouveau Café, she let us get clothes for ourselves and Asami not giving her clothes, and it would be difficult for Naveen to convince Asami to give Taunie clothes against Taunie’s personal wishes.

So Taunie does have her own way to try keep team harmony, just that she can also be blinded by her own personality sometimes.



# •Lida’s Spotlight is Short but it’s Okay: She’s Our Spokesperson

Roughly speaking, each Team MZ member plus Emma has their episode to shine. Naveen is in the Canari episode, Emma is in the Ivor episode, Taunie is all over the place as our main rival and Jacinthe episode probably counts.

Meanwhile, Lida just holds strategy meetings and accompanies us to Rust Syndicate’s place for negotiations during the Corbeau episode, the latter half of the episode is just us doing works alone with Corbeau popping up here and there.

But she is already lovable to many people because she often speaks with a stance closer to us than other members of Team MZ.

Indeed, she probably has the most understandable background to kids that played XY back in 2013: a girl that has a dream but can hardly pay rent.

For a person in their 20s, Lida is essentially a character saying things closer to what they think. She would have shared the same rent pressure if she hadn’t joined Team MZ and stayed in Hotel Z, and she’s also the one faces the loan shark together with us.

Indeed, debt and financial burden is the key.

From this point of view, she has already won the popularity game, Game Freak has already given her a great position.



# •From Composite Human Naveen-PC to Shy Genius Speculation

Naveen is partially a parody on contemporary streaming culture and parasocial behaviour, there’s no secrets in that. What’s interesting in the Canari episode is that when I chose an autograph instead of a promotion match during the Canari Quiz Whiz, Naveen was surprised, and he turned on the speaker and ask for a promotion match for us himself.

This causes two questions:

(i). Why couldn’t he just join the Quiz Whiz himself and ask for the same thing?

(ii). Why didn’t anyone cry cheating?

(i) is easy from storytelling and gameplay function (you’re PC, you’re meant to be the main show and do stuff), but difficult for in-game logic, a solution of (ii) can be proposed by partially answering (i).

Storytelling-wise, my suspicions is that we appearing as a composite human, with Naveen being the brain and us being the muscle, is meant to mirror “Canari” online. The real Canari is only responsible for game stream, while Tarragon is the one responsible for social, that makes “Canari” as a streamer also a composite human.

To Canari, who outright stated she knows we’re not the one answering after the Promotion Match, it’s probably because she herself is aware of the experience of being a composite and finds that to be okay, and that “biggest fan” Mani had been winning too much (he got all his plushies signed already), having a challenger checking him makes things less boring, even if such challenger is also a composite.

As for the fans, it’s probably because it doesn’t matter as long as it’s fun, and that we winning still means there’s someone behind us that has watched all the streams and known details of Canari well, and they deserves to win. Indeed, later when Gwynn met Naveen during that “cursed holovator” incident, she was aware it’s Naveen that had been answering in the quiz and challenged him that she won’t lose again.

But that still doesn’t answer the question: why couldn’t Naveen go on his own based on in-game settings?

My take is that Naveen is actually secretly shy. Or not that secret, really. He avoided joining the official fan club, preferred maintaining distance from Canari and complained we’re actually going to face Canari, and so on.

This can also be seen during Jacinthe’s episode as well. When we got our clothes from Boutique Couture, the designer Asami said “lately everyone’s been talking about this mystery designer named Naveen…but I won’t be outdone”… right in front of Naveen, who showed minimal reaction.

Naveen is the kind of person that has genius, but doesn’t want to be known clearly. He prefers just barely visible in the nameless crowd. He cheered when Canari replied to his comment in a stream, but didn’t want to get up close.

Technically, Naveen could have just denied us anything instead of offering a fight and claiming he couldn’t go down without a fight as a Canari fan. This is, of course, partially because of our friendship, but most likely also because he wanted someone to represent him in the Quiz Whiz anyway.

This sort of self-sabotaging behaviour can also be seen in Philippe’s action before the Rogue Mega Starmie fight: Corbeau had ordered him to guard the site from civilians, he wanted to let us in but he couldn’t disobey orders, so he decided to offer a fight because he wouldn’t be able to stop us if his Pokémon were down.

“It’s not that I don’t want to join the Quiz Whiz personally, but I got defeated, so I preferred staying in a secondary position and let PC took the main spot.”

But talent can’t be hidden forever, he will eventually be noticed and recognised, Gwynn has already seen him, Asami and the wider fashion design circle see his name. I think he’ll have a bright future.



# •Rust Syndicate: Yakuza Having Proto-state Function

It’s not hard to feel Corbeau is one of the most popular character in Z-A. For understandable reasons, the gap between what one expects from a Yakuza boss and what he happens to be is alluring.

Now, it’s not a secret that criminal organisations actually have relatively positive effects when compared with pure chaos, criminal organisations like Yakuza have always preferred to not sh-t where they eat and enforcing some sort of order. This kind of regulatory behaviour makes “governance” and resource extraction more efficient by building legitimacy through providing services.

I wonder if anyone recalls that post-Fukushima disaster, Yamaguchi-gumi actually ran black-market recruiting agencies and made homeless people/debt-ridden people (sometimes both, by offering food and shelter and revealing it demands money and they’re in debt later) work for dangerous decontamination contracts. This has always been how Yakuza works.

But without such disaster in the background (yet), this kind of behaviour also reveals how dysfunctional Lumiose’s government is.

Let’s see what has the Rust Syndicate done during the Corbeau episode:

i. Enforcing property rights: helping a guy to throw occupying Gengar and Ghastly outside of his will-be office. (Though that guy later shared it with Gengar because turns out throwing homeless Pokémon outside feels really bad).

ii. Maintaining public works: cleaning Lumiose sewers of Mega crystals—which should have been done by the City Hall.

iii. Keeping public peace: stopping SBC members harassing kids.

The only problem with all these is that they’re done by asking us to do so via debt slavery forced labour.

They later also actually seal up the area and block out civilians when that Starmie is about to go under Rogue Mega Evolution.

Meanwhile, what is the City Hall doing?

i. A police asks you for a Shuppet to try his idea of finding potential occurrence of crimes (horrifying idea ngl) and ends up finding his wife unhappy with him too focused on work.

ii. A police questions you over a goomy making benches sticky and happens to be next to you, battles you, and that goomy ends up owned by another kid who comes pick it up.

iii. Making Gwynn answer to noise complaints.

iv. Drawing up ever more Wild Zones for the Rogue Mega Evolution cover-up.

v. Pokémon centers, probably because their lights need to be on for the Z-A royale.

Obstacles around the city? Who cares. The tutorial in which you climb ladders onto the rooftop to circumvents road-blocking boulders caused by Pokémon moves is the accidental headline picture for Lumiose’s civil service. That police standing in front of that junction saying “if you’re looking for Hotel Z, it’s straight down this alley here” is just… Chef’s kiss.

[It’s not intentional, the NPC is stationary, but this is basically Lumiose Govt in a pic](https://preview.redd.it/ayamuftrsm5g1.jpg?width=3794&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3cfa92ba1ce3048d95a303c6de5e6420993583f1)

Rust Syndicate is not about whitewashing loan sharks—Corbeau tells you exactly not to, “I don’t think of myself as a hero, you know. Someone has to take action, that’s all”—it’s about informal power will step into the power vacuum, and the wrong people will slowly take power if the right people don’t use it.

Lumiose is a city where the official institutions are cosplay, and the Yakuza are the ones actually acting like a state.



# •The Reversed Sequence for Rust Syndicate and SBC is Crucial

By arranging us to fight him for the Rank V to Rank F jump, Vinnie has revealed us something highly important: the Promotion Match system can be rigged, Quasartico has just done it in front of us. And the reversed sequence in the Corbeau and Jacinthe matches is a hint that the Z-A Royale structure might be hijacked by powerful groups outside of Quasartico.

Now, we can look at the sequences for each Promotion Match.

For Canari, Ivor, and Grisham, they all happen in the following manner: You first get who you’re up against, then you approach them to try secure a match.

For Corbeau and Jacinthe, the opposite is true: You get their attention, they want a fight with you, and your Rotom Phone pops up, and your Promotion Match opponents just happens to be them.

And Corbeau’s Rust Syndicate and Jacinthe’s Society of Battle Connoisseurs also happen to have demonstrated their powers to make things happen. RS makes people do things for them via unreasonable interest rate and debt slavery—even a SBC member during Jacinthe’s tournament says she has fallen for it once. While Jacinthe literally has ties to secure a private holo-wall-tech, something belongs to Quasartico, for her own “Jacinthe Zone” use—she blockaded Hotel Z, locked tournament participants up, and got away with it scot-free.

It’s not outside of the realm of reasonable speculation that they both pulled some strings to ensure we will need to fight them. Corbeau saying “now isn’t that interesting. You’re my next opponent in the Z-A Royale. Fate itself is telling us we need to battle” is the funniest thing said in the episode, considering the whole episode basically involves debt-slavery, just with a human face.

One may argue the most simple explanation is that it’s good story practice to pair us with them considering we have just spent an episode worth of time for them. However, again, Doylist explanations are not valid Watsonian explanations. Once is a coincidence, twice is hardly one.



# •SBC Elitism/Vanguardism is What Others Have Been Doing Just Spoken Aloud

“It is our responsibility as elites to guide the masses, PC!”—Jacinthe during the Promotion Match when down to one Pokémon

Indeed, unapologetic elitism is what’s in Jacinthe’s mind, but others are not faring much better either, and Jacinthe is basically a mirror to what’s inside other group that have a programme for the city:

City Hall-Quasartico complex: We know what’s the best for Luminose and its people, and we’re covering things up to protect people’s everyday! Please don’t move away.

Fist of Justice: Segregation bad (true), people should just train with us to gid gud, let’s reach Rank A and just tear down the Wild Zones! …What do you mean some people like office workers and elderlies don’t have time or talent for that?

SBC: We should reach Rank A and make a wish about making each and every one of Lumiose’s residents into the strongest Trainer they can be! What do you mean there’re other ways to coexist with Pokémon and not everyone is interested in battles and I’m trying to impose a cultural hegemony where only engaging Pokémon battles with optimised strats is good taste and the right way to coexist?

It’s… honestly impressive that so many characters think for the people and the masses as something to be led, yet being so ignorant about it.

Jacinthe is a walking meme for how self-centred she is, sure, but she is basically a mirror of everyone else.



# •Grisham is More Rash than His Outward Behaviour Suggested

And no. Despite Team Flare Nouveau being the pariahs of the city, technically the lowest in the social status ladder, they aren’t any better.

Let’s look at Grisham and Griselle’s pitch regarding why we should give them AZ’s Floette again.

GH: “You must see it by now! With AZ’s special Floette, we should be able to keep Prism Tower controlled. Everything we’ve learned points to that conclusion! We must stop the tower from going on a rampage if we’re ever to achieve the kind of beautiful world Team Flare once dreamed of.”

GE: “And if WE can be the ones to protect Lumiose, then people will finally see us differently!”

GH: “Do you understand? We were mere children, born to those who chose to join Team Flare. And yet we too became pariahs in the eyes of society when Team Flare was disbanded.”

GE: “But we couldn’t just leave Lumiose! This city is our home too, and we love it as much as anyone else! The only reason Team Flare existed was to make Lumiose better! To make all of Kalos better!”

GH: “At Nouveau Café, we’ve worked hard to provide coffee to those who have little else… And as we’ve worked there, we’ve also heard the voices of Lumiose’s people. We understand this city better than anyone else. We know its people better than anyone else. So if you really want to face me in battle, you’ll need more than just a Challenger’s Ticket. You’ll need to be ready to hand over AZ’s Floette to me. I must become the strongest Pokémon Trainer by battling my way up through the Z-A Royale. I must become the strongest Mega Evolution user. Then I will be the one to restrain Prism Tower with AZ’s Floette!”

So basically Grisham’s pitch is based on several backbones:

i. We deserve a redemption arc because we’re not responsible for that fantastic nuke Lysandre tried to shoot;

ii. We love Lumiose and represent the people more than anyone else;

iii. Grisham is, indeed, the foremost Rank B trainer and has highest hope to be the strongest Mega Evolution user.

(iii) is easy, we later demolished that point through battle, let’s look at (i) and (ii) a little.

For (ii), let’s look at Nouveau Café’s description on the map:

“A café that has been the talk of the town lately, thanks to its quality roasts and its policy of not charging the disadvantaged.”

It’s still new, still being the talk of the town. And Griselle and Grisham already claiming they know the city’s people better than anyone else because they served coffee for some time.

For (i), let’s compare how other samples handle “redemption”:

AZ: maybe they do have a point about feeling unfair over AZ gets to be “weird 3,000 y/o giant” trying to atone for his mess when he literally fired the ultimate weapon 3,000 years ago and build the Prism Tower 2,000 years ago which partially resulted in the current mess when they don’t get to atone. However, AZ, also because he’s no longer capable of fighting, is willing to delegate the chance of personal redemption to those that actually can, instead of trying to force himself to do so, he also tries to be as helpful as he can. Meanwhile, “it must be me” attitude runs amok in Grisham’s idea and he already demands using Floette as the stake for the Promotion Battle—he hasn’t even prove himself to be the actual strongest Mega Evolution user yet.

Mable: Scientist of Team Flare, basically got Operation Papercliped despite being much closer to Lysandre’s plan. Gets to research what she was researching anyway in laboratory in a plea deal. Doesn’t shy when being asked about is she an ex-Team Flare member, maybe gets stigma from it but still respectable figure due to being the acting director of the lab. This, again, sounds quite unfair. However, as revealed in (ii), the time is the key here. Mable has worked under the Mayor’s (who, honestly, sounds like a dunce from all evidence) thumb for roughly five years by now. Have Grisham and Griselle poured coffee for even two years is debatable.

Despite looking way chiller than Griselle’s “PC is our ENEMY and let’s burn him/her to the ground” attitude on a micro-scale, looking at the big picture, Grisham is also ridiculously rash in trying to gain redemption as well.

Redemption is gained by sometimes accepting you will not be the one doing the spectacular work, still being helpful anyway, and let time and your track record wash things away. Not by forcing through a spectacular show to blackmail everyone else to be thankful for it.

  
These are some of my thoughts about the story up to this point. I hope this can provoke some thoughts to the plot so that we can maybe see some deeper insights—which may or may not agree with me. I just feel the story worths a deep reading from everyone, and such reading can make us appreciate it more.",0,1765048139.0,PokemonZA,3,0.5,False

**SCRIPT:**

 

*(SFX: Faint synth/electronic music in the background. Intermittent bursts of distant thunder.)*

Okay, Chloe. You can do this. You can- you’ve got this.

No, really. You can do this. All you have to do is- is open the door for him, smile, invite him to sit down with you, and then-

Wait. Should I hug him? Friends can hug, right? That- that wouldn’t be inappropriate. No, that....that’s just fine. But what if he gets spooked? What if my perfume is on too strong and gives him a nosebleed?

Oh, Chloe. Don’t be silly. Then you can just give him a napkin from this dressing room. What’s more concerning is how I look. Do I look fine? Uh....the industry seems to think so. I was on the cover of two fashion magazines last week, I mean, but like- what if- what if he doesn’t recognise me? What if he finds me *too* beautiful and stutters and trips over all his words?

Awww. That would be so cute! Come to think of it, he used to do that sometimes even when we were- even when I was just Chloe. Plain, simple, girl-next-door Chloe with a guitar and ten pages of discarded lyrics. Urgh.

But how long should I wait after he knocks? I don’t want to open the door right away. That would make it seem like I’m desperate. Maybe....maybe I should let him knock twice. Or thrice. And then slowly saunter over, and-

(Groaning) Nooooo. Stop it! He’s....he’s my best friend. He used to be. There’s no need for such games between us. I....I will just be myself.

Come on, Chloe. You were up there in front of a crowd of 50,000 just thirty minutes ago. You can do this. What’s entertaining one more fan, right?

Fan....huh....I wonder if he has actually listened to my music.....maybe I should ask him.

Okay. Breathe. Just wait for him to knock- twice- then get up, walk over casually, open the door for him, and....and....

*(SFX: Knockin’ on Chloe’s door)*

*(A little too quickly, like 0.5 seconds- SFX: Opening the door)*

(Awkward pause)

(Breathing audibly. Stunned silence, as if she’s just seen the long-lost love of her life....which, actually-)

(Almost inaudibly) Hi.

You, um, you brought flowers! Oh gosh, and they’re peonies. My favourite! (Softly) You....you still remember that.

No, it’s- it’s good to see *you!* Wow. You haven’t changed at all. And yet, your hair seems gelled and combed. And you- did you shave this morning?

Duuuude! You didn’t have to do all that! I’m- I’m Chloe! It’s meeee! What, you didn’t just drop off some date of yours to her house before circling back here, right?

Please. You could score plenty of dates.

Well, you’re still single because “my kind” is afraid of approaching *you!* It’s like- you know how you’re deathly afraid of spiders in your house? But really, that spider is even more afraid of you.

....No. I’m not comparing women with spiders. Well, maybe some of us. But then I’d also have to compare some men with flies. I mean, some of you guys do fall rather easily for sweet words and pretty eyes. Like flies trapped in a web. Or- or the other way round. It’s not a- (nervous laugh)- not gender specific.

I am making this weird, aren’t I?

Yeah. Please, come in. I’ve kept you standing outside long enough. Sorry.

*(SFX: Closing the door behind them)*

(Another awkward pause. Breathing audibly, nervously, excitedly.)

So, um....

Oh, right! Yeah. Yeah, please sit down! And you can give me the bouquet. I’ll just....yeah, I’ll set it down over here for now. Thanks.

(As if in a reverie) Hm?

No, I....I’m alright. It’s just....these flowers look so pretty. So pink, and pale, but with a quiet vibrancy of their own. I’m just feeling so many emotions right now, you know?

Yeah. Disappointment at seeing you is definitely one of them. I’m disappointed you did not give me a hug. (Pouting) What’s the matter with you, huh?

Are you....*allowed* to? Oh, sweet heavens- (sighing heavily)- no, I’m sure there’s a bunch of bodyguards hiding behind that curtain, waiting to jump you the moment you give me a friendly hug.

Well, too bad. There’s nothing stopping *me* from hugging you. Come here, dork.

*(SFX: Faint rustling of clothes, breathing up close, making content little noises)*

Mmnnn....I missed you, you know? It....it’s nice, seeing you again.

Awww! Are you blushing? You’re so *cute!* Still just as shy and easily flustered, huh?

Please. I’m not teasing you. I would never! I’m just....hugging my best friend, you know?

Hugging him for a little too long, it seems. (Fake coughing) Right. Sorry. I don’t want to suffocate you. Please, sit down. What would you like to drink? Tea, coffee, coke?

Yeah, okay. That wasn’t a suggestion. The concert lasted for 90 minutes and you don’t strike me as the kind of guy to carry around a bottle of water unless it has, like, a Ben 10 sticker on it or something. You’re parched.

Fine. Here’s some water. And then we’re having coffee I guess, because you didn’t specify a beverage. “Just water” doesn’t count.

*(SFX: Clinking cutlery, rummaging about)*

Oh? Liked my show, did you? Was the VIP lounge alright? I asked my manager to personally ensure you were comfortable and had everything you needed. What did you think of her?

Ah. I’m glad to hear that! Yes, she can be a little intimidating, but she’s also very charming when she wants to be, isn’t she? Miss Hathaway....she has really helped me a lot.

She told me she likes you already, you know? (Low, cryptic) She um, she approves of you, you might say.

Oh, I only mentioned you to her, like, a quadrillion times or so! As much as I’m grateful to her, and to *Billboard,* the recording studios, the touring musicians, and the mags and sponsors and all that, I made one thing very clear.

I....would never have come this far without you. It all began with you. All of it! You- you were pretty much the foundation stone.  

Uh- (laughing in embarrassment)- uh, yeah, I wrote that single about you. *Foundation Stone.* I’ll admit, it’s a poor phrase to sum up what I feel about your....contributions....and I’m not super proud of how I sound in that song, but like....yeah. It’s about you.

“Stepping on the stone, and shooting for the sun”- that’s, no, I didn’t mean- I didn’t mean, like, *stepping on you.* Why do you have to- (breaking into giggles)- oh gosh, you weren’t supposed to take it literally! That....hmnn, maybe it does sound sort of embarrassing in retrospect. (Groaning) God, I’m sorry. I just meant, none of this would have happened without your help.

(Lightly offended) I’m being serious. When I was writing the song, I- I thought of all the ways you had helped me, back when I was basically unknown. Just some girl with a guitar, and so many unfinished songs in her head. You inspired me to put those feelings into words, helped me pen a few lyrics even, and sat patiently for hours in my bedroom as I assaulted your ears and fraying sanity with my *music.*

(Solemnly) Success is built on sacrifice, and boy, did you make some sacrifices. History hasn’t forgotten you, my old friend.

Well, then I certainly haven’t. Listen, this is going to sound kinda cringe, but like....most of my songs, they’re....(in a small voice) they’re about you, you know?

(Lingering silence)

(Too deep in the water now to go back) I....when I was writing the lyrics, and singing, I’d find myself thinking of you. It’s actually you that’s- that’s the unseen listener, to whom all those cheesy and, at times, heartfelt words are addressed.....you know?

Right. Of course you- you didn’t know that. Uh, so I *really* did not intend to just talk about myself and my journey when I invited you- this isn’t an AMA- but my debut album, which was named-

(Embarrassed, hiding her face like a blushing schoolgirl) *New Symmetry.* Yeah. Oh gosh, you- you *listened?*

You thought it was pretty amazing? Really? (Sighing) Honey, you have nothing to gain through flattery. But in any case, here’s some cookies and coffee. Please help yourself.

Yeah, they are shortbread cookies. You always seemed to like them when we were- back when we-

Hey, are you alright? You look a little....emotional.

Oh, babe. Boys are so easy, aren’t they?

Nothing. So, about my album- (clicking her tongue, as if questioning her life choices)- *New Symmetry,* this is- gosh, this is sooooo embarrassing to admit, but you inspired pretty much all the songs in there, one way or another.

Yeah. There was this single, *Dreamer Boy.* It’s basically all you. I- I kept picturing that evening in my bedroom, when I wasn’t feeling so well. Nobody was home, and you offered to stay over and take care of me despite all my protests, simply because you had- how did you put it?- you had “nothing better to do”.

Of course I remember that. (Softly pouting) Dummy. How could I not? It was on that night I, for the first time, told you about my dream. About how I hoped that, one day, the world would listen to my music. Find something of comfort or joy, however little, in my songs and stories. And then I asked you about your dream. Do you remember what you said?

(A longer pause)

You said you had no dreams of your own. Which was a crazy thing to say. But even then, you were pretty big on the idea of dreams. You said you’d be- that you’d be happy, just watching and helping me reach mine. You took me seriously. You didn’t judge, or dismiss my silly ambitions. All you did....was sit at the edge of my bed, and smile softly, and your eyes caught the light and glowed with a fire of their own. Just like now.

(A longer pause)

(Smiling in reminiscence) You learnt to string a guitar for my sake when I was just starting out. You didn’t want me going all the way to the store. And you showed up at all my local events. Always standing there, in the front row, smiling and cheering me on. (Heartfelt, barely restraining her emotions) You....you were the one constant source of light and joy in my life.

You did more than just that, babe. I never met my mother. And dad- (sighing) dad was always distant. Busy. If you weren’t there, I- I think I’d have gone insane.

(Somewhat taken aback) Excuse me?

(Forced politeness) Glad you like the coffee. How....nice of you, to mention that. Thanks.

Uh huh.

(Sighing tiredly) Yeah. I’ve been busy these last few years. Life has been an endless whirlwind of concerts, studios, fashion magazines and the press. I imagine you must have been very busy yourself.

Of course you were. You didn’t return my texts. Or emails. I’m sure you meant to, but....

(Slowly) Right. It sort of just....fizzled out.

Hmn.

Oh no, it’s fine, really. I don’t blame you for thinking I might no longer have time for you. That’s a, um, a perfectly normal thing to think, even when we’ve been best friends for most of our teenage years.

Offend me? Now, why would you say that? Hm?

(A long, tense pause)

(Strangely distant) I could tell you were lying, you know?

Everyone has a dream. Everyone. Even you. You just didn’t want to share yours with me.

Because you were afraid. And now that I look at you, I see you’re still afraid. You....you just can’t say it to me, can you?

You know what.

(Testy silence)

All those times you came to my house, all those summer afternoons you spent in my room. All those walks through town after dark, our quiet conversations, all the times you made me laugh, the little notes you left in my locker at school. Every little jam session and rehearsal you showed up to. Was all of it simply- simply because we were friends?

Is that all you want to be in my life?

Just....a friend?

Excuse me?

(Quiet indignation) Who says that’s all you can be? I’m- (struggling for words) I’m not too distant for you to reach. I’m not- not some kind of fairy-tale goddess, alright? All it takes, is one call. One text. Anything!

The only distance between us, is what you’ve created yourself. For reasons I can’t understand.

(Vulnerable) Do you not like me anymore?

Do you think I’ve....changed?

No? Then what is it? Why won’t you- why won’t you just....?

(A long pause, both of them searching for words to fill the silence)

You’re right. Perhaps we shouldn’t be talking about this.

Yeah. Yeah, I do have....something to attend to, shortly.

It was nice seeing you again as well. I....I hope you’ll be happy after this.

It’s not that you look sad. You look- you look like you’re having a bit of trouble walking, is all.

Hey, hey! Are you alright?

Ssshhh. I’ve got you. It’s okay. I’m not going to let you fall. This- this is just a hug. You like those, right? (Smiling ever so gently) At least when they’re from me?

Nothing’s happening. Ssshhh. Do not worry your pretty little head about it, alright? Your thoughts are starting to get....sluggish, right about now. As are your muscles.

You really liked the coffee, didn’t you? It must have tasted....*sweet.*

Poor thing. You look so woozy, so helpless. So....cute.

(Voice dropping) This- I think this might be awakening something in me.

Hush, baby. I’ve got you. You’re safe. You’re with me. You’re safe in my arms. (Whispering) Always have been.

My manager’s a really nice woman, you know? And she’s also a woman of means. And she understands what I’m going through. This whole showbiz thing- it tends to mess with your mental health real bad. Miss Hathaway just wants what’s best for me. If I’m happy, I make good music. And my fans love it so much. And they’re so generous with their money.

Really, it’s a win-win for everyone if I’m happy. And do you know what’s the one thing in the world which makes me the happiest of all?

(Whispering) It’s *you*.

*(SFX: Distant rumbling of thunder)*

Do you hear it? The thunder, outside the stadium? I wonder if it has started raining on the streets yet.

A thunderstorm means fewer pedestrians. Fewer witnesses. Not that anyone’s going to be able to see you anyway. We’ll be out in a jiffy, and then you’ll be inside my car. I had the windows tinted with the darkest shade they had available.

(Shushing him gently, crooning softly) It’s okay, babe. I’m only taking you home. Your real home. (Whispering) With me.

I have waited so, so, so long for this. You don’t even have a clue. I wouldn’t have had to do this if only you were- (sighing)- if only you could’ve been honest with me.

But it’s alright. This- (light, innocent laughter)- this is kinda fun!

Awww, is it lights out already? Can you still see me? Can you see my face?

What a shame. (Sighing morosely) Wanted to keep talking to you for a while longer. But you’re barely conscious.

The drug....the medicine, it- it suppresses your adrenaline response. You’re nice and relaxed, if confused. (Frowning softly) Afraid, even.

(Pecking his forehead) Don’t be. Nothing’s going to happen to you. I won’t ever let something happen to you. (Gleeful) I can finally- *finally*\- take care of you now, the way I’ve always wanted to.

I wanted to kiss you on your lips, not just your forehead. But our first real kiss shouldn’t be like this. I’ll kiss you properly when you’re awake.

Look at you. So sweet. So....very....precious. Like a baby.

I’m sorry for mixing that medicine in your coffee, baby. Tell you what- once we’re in my car, you can rest your head on my lap, alright? I’ll play with your hair, and give you more forehead kissies. (Pecking his forehead again) Just like this. What do you say?

Ssshhh. I know, baby. I know. You can’t talk right now. It’s okay. I....I already know.

You chose to come to my show. You wanted to see me. You have missed me too, haven’t you?

You came to see me. You....

(Whispering, fervently, over and over)

1pfx33n,https://i.redd.it/zv0rk6q4tm5g1.jpeg,I have a food trailer but little operational experience — what would you do in my situation?,"Hi everyone,
I’m looking for some outside perspective because I feel too close to the problem to see it clearly.

I bought a food trailer (Located in LA) with the idea of selling smoothies, fruit bowls, and fresh juices. I have the equipment, branding, menu prototypes, and the vision. I’m also considering expanding the menu into cold sandwiches and coffee, which could open more opportunities throughout the day.

The issue is that I don’t have much experience actually operating the business, and I’ve realized that the day-to-day side of it (towing the trailer, dealing with permits, troubleshooting, low sales days, and stress) is way heavier than I expected.

I also have a stable job that I can’t afford to risk because it pays my bills. I really like the business concept and I don’t want to give up, but it’s becoming clear that I can’t scale it alone. Ideally, I’d like someone who could help operate it or even run it day-to-day, while I invest, supervise, and work on growing the brand.

So my dilemma is:

• Should I look for a partner?
• Someone to operate it and get paid a percentage?
• Should I rent out the trailer to someone with experience who runs it under my brand?
• Or should I sell it and focus on something less demanding?

I feel like my limitation isn’t the concept — it’s my lack of time and operational experience.
What would you do if you were in my shoes, and how would you structure something like this?

Thanks for reading.

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long.

I don't use the build-in grinder, I use a Comandante grinder with the Red Clix.

I don't have a WDT and I have the regular tamper from Sage (gear from Normcore is on its way).

The coffee I use was roasted on the 24th of november. The roaster recommended that I wait until the 4th of december. It's a natural coffee from Brasil, catuai variety, medium roast.

My workflow is as follow :
- 16g in, 32 g out
- double espresso basket, single wall (non pressurized)
- shake the basket to even it out, then tamp, always the same pressure
- press the ""double espresso"" button (60g out) and stop it manually when it reaches 32 grams in the cup

I went through 100g of coffee, just changing the grind. Here are the (depressing) results :

- 16 clicks (so 8 regular comandante clicks) : coffee starts coming out at 10 seconds, I reach 32 grams in only 14 seconds.

- 20 clicks : coffee comes out at 8 seconds, 32 g out at 14 seconds.

- 28 clicks : coffee starts coming out at 7 seconds, done at 13 seconds.

- 30 clicks (way out of espresso range) : starts coming out at 7 seconds, done at 12.

And every time it's super watery. It basically goes straight through. 

Espresso is a bit long to start coming out (manual recommands 4-7 seconds), but then is done way too quick. 

So it should be channeling right ? 

But I don't get rid of it by grinding coarser (comandante website says espresso range on the red clix is 14-26 clicks).

I'm getting a bit desperate here. My leads are :

1) I tamp too hard ? Which would explain the channeling even when grinding coarse ?

2) using the double espresso program (60g out), even when stopping it early, is somehow using too much water too fast ?

3) I didnt try grinding super fine and I should try with idk, 10-12 clicks (5-6 on a regular comandante)

4)  ...WDT will solve everything ?

I also gave it a try with the pressurized basket and the single espresso program (30 grams out), 16 clicks. It started flowing at 7 seconds, went out super thick, but the program ended at 20 seconds with only 13 grams in the cup. Progress I guess, but what does it say about what I'm doing wrong ?

Thank you so much if you took the time to read all of this. I'm gonna calm down with a V60. What a trip.

And I am grateful for 3 encounters within 24 hrs that were so random. 
The first encounter was a from a man that approached my car with a voucher in his Candace’s down so that I couldn’t see. I was told it was a free meal I font know from where but not being ungrateful I declined the meal without knowing any details My fear was not being able to use it since I am a vegetarian and chancing it going to waste! I suggested giving it to someone who could really use a meal. I felt horrible incase he thought that I was being ungrateful where infact it was the opposite!
A few hours later this cad with catchy plates backs up beside Me. I don’t pay attention but out of the corner of my eye I see a little girl waving hi and holding out a coffee. 
Cup with the other. She said hi we (her dad was in the driver’s seat watching the whole exchange through the open door). Bought you this French vanilla and this gift card  I was crushed. I know longer felt the guilt of refusing the free meal but this girl was getting so much out of her random acting kindness. I graciously played along with the same level of enthusiasm. When I told her that was my favourite well she gleamed the brightest smile with a wee giggle effect. Mission accomplished and she quickly jumped in her car and after the chorus of thank you and Merry  Christmas, they drove out of sight. That exhange ment the world to me not becsuse of what I was getting but because what my reactions meant to her! Seeing her joy and her seeing mine was a win win for the Christmas spirit. The third interaction happened rather quickly and thus car pulls up beside me and are extended held out a coffee cup. To me. Hear Merry Christmas, this French vanilla is for  you then they said Merry Christmas and drove away. 
Now I think these three interactions were the spirit of Christmas teaching me a lesson 
A) don’t take away from someone that you might nit be able to use and might waste 
B) receive graciously you might make someone’s day by doing so. 
C) kindness occurs sometimes in a split second and out of the blue. 
I do enjoy doing spontaneous stuff myself so these three events found me and I want to continue the trend and do the same ! Not because it is Christmas and the Christmas's spirit is upon us but I want  to spread Rangoon acts of kindness among others the whole year through.

All the reviews mention how heavy it is, but my first thought unboxing it was ""wow! it's heavy!""  LOL.  I've watched many YouTube videos on the 9Barista so felt prepared to use it.

I've been using a Moka pot to make strong coffee for faux cortados and cappuccinos but wanted to also be able to make real espresso without the complexity of a regular pump espresso machine (some sort of lever machine might be in my future).  The 9Barista seemed like a good, if rather pricey, solution.

I received my Mk. 2 9Barista (Standard + steel basket cap) less than 48 hours ago so I have had limited time to work with it.  I'm using a 250g tin of Illy Classico beans as a starting point & grinding with a 1Zpresso X-Ultra. My first shots were way too fast and one was way too long.  None tasted particularly good but helped me zero in on the right grind setting.

My latest attempt (maybe 6th total) was a success! 18g coffee => 42g liquid in about 22 seconds.  It tasted wonderful!  I am very happy with the result!  Next shot will have to be tomorrow as I am already over-caffeinated lol (I will go just one click finer for it). 

Other thoughts: the wooden handles do get quite hot even though they are not over heating element.  I am considering ordering the anodized aluminum ones from the pro.  I am using an electric stove top and found that I need to turn the smaller element up to the maximum setting.  I don't put the device on the heat until it is glowing red.

Back to the issue, one of the regulars, a guy in his early 60s was asking the owner when next time (pretty server in her early 30s) was scheduled to work and he just gave it away to the semi drunk regular old dude, without even a hesitation.. 

I feel really bad for the girl because this guy is obviously gonna be a problem at some point, or he probably already is.

1pfwoha,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pfwoha,🍁Fall Exchange 2025: Thank You to My Wonderful Nova Scotia Partner u/BrJean19!🍁,"I opened my Fall Exchange box and immediately had to laugh, because my partner u/BrJean19 and I apparently share one brain cell when it comes to snacks. The first thing I pulled out was a Peace by Chocolate bar, which I had been debating sending myself - and then the cow chips with “just trust me” written across the front. I had thought several times about including those too! The synchronicity had me grinning before I even got to the rest of the package.

From there it kept getting better...

My partner sent so many Nova Scotia-made items that the whole package started to feel like a little tour of their region. A lot of the goodies tied back to things we’d talked about throughout the exchange.

They included books, which were one of my favourite parts of the package:

They sent **Bluenose Magic** by *Helen Creighton* and **Even More Ghost Stories** **of Nova Scotia** by *Vernon Oickle*.

**Bluenose Magic** seems to be a folklore collection full of old maritime beliefs, charms, superstitions, and strange stories that have been passed down through families.

***Even more Ghost Stories*** seems to be a collection of regional ghost stories told in a casual, conversational way that seems like it will be a lot of fun to read!

During our conversations we exchanged photos from our areas - I shared pictures from northern Ontario lakes and islands where I spent my summer, and they shared the beautiful ocean views near their home. We also spent a lot of time talking about local legends, ghost stories, folklore, and history. Receiving these books felt incredibly personal because of that. Getting items tied to Nova Scotia made it feel like we were trading little pieces of our homes, it made everything in the box feel even more connected to our conversations.

And to go with the books, they included a bag of local **Just Us! Chasing Tides** light roast coffee, which is so smooth, as well as a **Coastal Cove** candle made in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia,  in the scent Pink Sandy Beach. They mentioned it's one of their favourites, with notes of *jasmine, frangipani, and white musk*. Both will pair perfectly with the new reading stack!

I also received two large, beautiful[ soup bowls with cozies](https://i.imgur.com/O1w672w.jpeg), a couple of tea towels, three soup mixes from **Mitchell’s Soup Company**, and a jar of delicious candied jalapenos from Nova Scotia’s, **The Candied Jalapeno Company**. They’re perfect - sweet and spicy.

Throughout the exchange we talked a lot about hair and skincare, and my partner sent items that lined up with all of those conversations. They added two products from **Tweak’d by Nature** \- a brand based in Quebec - a hair restoring treatment balm and an everything balm, both with really pretty notes of *vanilla, coconut, almond milk, honey, and amber.*

They also included a peppermint moisturizing bar soap made in Nova Scotia by **All-Ways-Us**. It smells super refreshing - I adore peppermint around this time of year. There was also a handmade scrunchie, a cute extra that is already being used.

I also received a Klavuu Lavender sunscreen, a Korean sunscreen. I love trying new sunscreens, so I’m excited to see how this one wears.

Another item was a **Pearl Beauty Cosmetics** bronzer stick - a UK indie makeup brand I’ve been wanting to try. The shade looks beautiful and very wearable, and I’ve heard great things about the formula too. And tucked in as well, was an Hourglass cream cleanser, one of my partner’s favourite brands, which makes me even more excited to try it.

An honorable mention goes to the “Black Cat Energy” sticker. I even got my own black cat, Bud, to pose with it - his energy was very on point. My tabby, Juniper, decided she wanted in on the action too, so she’s in there as well for your viewing pleasure.

As if everything else weren’t already amazing, my partner also curated a stunning selection of perfumes, with full sizes and samples from houses entirely new to me. Some of the scents included were:

# Sorce:

*One of my exchange partner’s fave houses! I finally get to try Match Made in Heaven and also her favourite, Falling Stars!*

**Match Made in Heaven (FS) -** matcha, vanilla soft serve, cherry blossom, almond, waffle cone, powdered sugar, creamy sandalwood

*First thoughts: There's a lovely sweet matcha note and the waffle cone is loud at first, then settles into creamy vanilla with a hint of cherry blossom. Cozy and edible without being heavy.* 

**Witch’s Valentine (FS) -** marshmallow, Moroccan rose absolute, raspberry purée, white chocolate, suede

*First thoughts: Marshmallow and rose right away\~ The raspberry is bright and delicious. The suede note gives it a soft, almost ""blurred"" base. Its surprisingly wearable and delicious.* 

**Falling Stars Mean You Are With Me (Salted Vanilla Cream) (FS) -** black coffee, almond cream, sandalwood, natural oud, palo santo, tonka bean absolute, vanilla bean

*First thoughts: On my skin it opens with a soft coffee note but its not bitter or harsh at all.. the almond cream melds well with the coffee note so it smells warm and rounded, rather than sharp. The vanilla and tonka show up early for me, making the opening feel creamy and slightly sweet without veering into any sugary territory.* 

*The wood notes make their appearance slowly.. The sandalwood and palo santo are super lovely and seem to keep the scent grounded - they keep the vanilla note from ever feeling too heavy. The oud in this is soft and never turns animalistic - It adds depth but stays in the background. Everything smell incredibly balanced and well-blended.*

*As this dries down, the salted vanilla cream becomes the main focus to me (which I love). Its milky, and a little warm. The saltiness keeps the sweetness in check and from ever feeling cloying, and the tonka note tops it all off leaving it with a smooth finish. The coffee has faded almost completely by the end, leaving me with a cozy vanilla+wood base that sits close to the skin. I can see why this is one of my partners favourites! Once it settles, the mixture of coffee, soft woods, and vanilla feels perfect and so beautiful on the skin.* 

**Between the Sheets -** fig, cream, beeswax absolute, cashmere, wool, skin musk

# Olivine Atelier:

*A perfume house my partner really loves! I do love their style and themes a lot too - I had never heard about them before the exchange.*

**Amethyst Moon (FS) -** Tahitian gardenia, coconut palm, vanilla orchid. LE.

*I really enjoyed what I got from this while I was opening everything. I will need to try it more soon.*

**More Than Stars -** Stargazer lily, almond, gardenia, Egyptian musk, sandalwood, vanilla, vetiver.

**Wolf Moon -** Amber, vanilla, soft musk.

# NAVA:

*Another one of my partner’s favourite houses. I’ve seen them mentioned on IMAM for years but had never tried them before. My partner helped explain their catalogue system and some of their favourite notes, which I really appreciated. They were so helpful and knowledgeable!*

**Dream Time (FS) -** Italian lavender, French lavender, California sweet grass, cedarwood, ginger absolute, cardamom absolute, hinoki wood, white sage, Envie Parfum Saphir absolute

**Eternal Ankh Pastel Candy Corn -** Candy Corn Accord, Butter Musk Accord, Vanilla Sugar, French Vanilla, Crystalline Vanilla Musk Crème, Vanilla Fleck Marshmallow, Bastet’s Musk Absolute, Studio Limited Original Moonstone (African White Vanilla/Crystalline Vanilla), Bastet's Musk Absolute, White Amber, Egyptian Vanilla Husk, Vanilla Fleck, African White Vanilla, and NA Egyptian Sands Accord

**Faboolous -** Toasted Coconut Crème Brulée Accord, Caramelized Sugar Accord, Brown Sugar Accord, Rum infused Sugar Accord, Vanilla Bean Fleck, Vanilla Musk, Crystalline Vanilla Musk Absolute, Tonka Bean, Vanilla Cordial Accord, French Vanilla, Bastet’s Musk Absolute, Jasmine Essence, Patchouli Essence, Cardamom Absolute, Cardamom Seed Extract, Vanilla Caramel Custard Accord, Amber Sugar Accord, and Amber Musk

**Ma’at Amber -** Cashmere Wood Accord, Sweet Red Patchouli Accord, Sweet Red Tobacco Accord, Bastet’s Amber Absolute (essential oil of Rare and Exotic Guiacwood, Crystal Benzoin, and Crystal Frankincense), Amber Musk Accord, Egyptian Lotus blossom Absolute, White Patchouli absolute, Jasmine Essence, Rose Essence, French Lavender, Oakmoss Accord, Himalayan Cedarwood, Skin Musk, White Cinnamon, Lemon and Mandarin Zest, White Pepper Essence, Sweet Frankincense, Languid Amber Accord, and Golden Amber Incense Accord.

**Etherian Vanilla -** Vanilla Absolute, Labdanum Absolute, Vanilla Bean Cordial Accord, Tahitian Vanilla Absolute, Marshmallow Accord, White Cinnamon, Benzoin, White Pine Essence, Lemon and Orange Zest, Lemon Crème Accord, Pomegranate Seed Accord, Peony Accord, Raspberry Seed Essence Accord, Frankincense Incense, Studio Limited Moonstone Absolute (African White Vanilla, Crystalline Vanilla Musk), Bastet’s Musk, Custard Accord, and White Sandalwood.

**Polyphemus -** Vanilla Bean Cordial, Benzoin Absolute, Tonka Bean Absolute, Vanilla Marshmallow, Toasted Vanilla Bean, Burning Woods Essence Accord, and Studio Limited Original Kobalt Absolute (Vanilla Orchid blend).

**Cotton Candy Salted Caramel Pumpkin & Fig Vanilla Musk -** Sea Salt Caramels, Raw Pumpkin Flesh, Fig Skin, Sweet Musk, Crystalline Vanilla Musk Absolute, Sweet Vanilla Milk Accord, Cotton Candy, Strawberry, French Vanilla, and Vanilla Bean Fleck Marshmallow.

*And yes… my partner wrote all of these notes out BY HAND Please press* ***F*** *for their carpal tunnel. The dedication was UNREAL.*

# Osmofolia:

*I’ve been wanting to try this indie house for a long time. I love how many perfumeries I was introduced to!*

**Marshmallow -** Fluffy puffy marshmallows, fresh and soft, reminiscent of sugar cubes, vanilla bean, orris root powder, heliotrope, and fluffy, powdery musks.

**And Life and the Fields -** Tonka beans and timothy hay drying in the sunlight, warm amber, bees zooming away from the orange blossoms back to their honeycomb hives, juicy apricots ripening in the heat, and dusty fields of of wild oats and wheat waiting to be harvested.  (The name and notes just triggered ""Another Diamond Day"" by vashti Bunyan in my head 🎶)

**Sungrown -** Fresh cut grass, wild blueberries, dandelions, mimosas, patchouli, and distant bonfire smoke.

# Lucky #9:

*Cat-themed perfumes! So cute and absolutely fitting*

**Catsuma -** Sweet candied tangerine, white musk

**Fireside Floof -** Toasted marshmallow, smoldering woods, fire-roasted vanilla, crystallized amber

# Pulp Fragrance:

*Toasted Marshmallow is one I've really wanted to try but always end up removing from my cart to be responsible - I swear my partner can read minds!*

**Toasted Marshmallow -** Sweet, gooey marshmallow with just a touch of caramel and woody smoke.

# Wylde Ivy:

*So many Wylde Ivy scents! I was actually thinking about ordering some for my partner, so the fact that they didn’t work for her and she passed them on to me feels oddly perfect.*

**The Owl -** crystallized wildflower honey, smoked vanilla beans, raw amber, birch wood

**Lost Lenore -** dewy pink roses, faded parchment, ambergris, dried heather, white amber sugar.

**In Love With Melancholy -** crushed vanilla beans, aged cedarwood, port-stained parchment, fireplace embers

**Thaleia -** acai berries, pomelo fruit, white tea, sugared amber

**Abominably Adorable -** fire-scorched marshmallows, steamed vanilla milk, warm white amber, crushed alpine flowers

**Witch’s Tea -** Black tea leaves, birch wood, vanilla sugar, clove, dried amber, pumpkin, currants, dried apples, black heliotrope, bonfire smoke

Everything in the package felt deeply personal. It touched on so many things we’d shared - snacks and food, hair and skin care, folklore and regional stories, our scent preferences, and the houses we both love. It made exploring each item feel meaningful.

This was my partner’s first exchange, and I truly feel lucky. What started as simple messages turned into one of the most fun and meaningful conversations I’ve ever had online. We wandered through travel, food, baking, movies, shows, music, politics, history, fashion, and every small topic that comes up when you really click with someone.

We even lived through the Canada Post strike together, watching our tracking freeze and unfreeze like a suspense movie. Somehow it made the whole experience even more memorable.

I signed up at the very last minute, and she only joined because I needed a partner, but it honestly felt meant to be.

# A HUGE THANK YOU to u/BrJean19 for making this exchange so special! From the thoughtful items to the conversations we shared, you turned this into an experience I’ll remember for a long time. I appreciate you so much, and I can’t wait to share even more my thoughts with you as I explore everything. 💜",35,1765046741.0,Indiemakeupandmore,6,1.0,False

My boyfriend makes quite a bit more than I do. 

So, a few weeks ago I had $15 dollars in my purse (3 5’s) and was using it as coffee money. This purse stayed in the living room for about a week. One day while my boyfriend was home, I went to take a 5 out and noticed 2 of them were gone. I dug around my whole purse and then asked “did you take 10 bucks out of here?” Just genuinely confused about where it went. He got quite angry at me for “accusing” him of stealing. I figured since I genuinely have no recollection of it that somehow I could have spent it and apologized and moved on. 

Yesterday, I got $300 from my grandma as a gift (all in 50s). I left the card with the money in the living room and when my boyfriend got home that night I casually brought up how I got some money. Anyways today I was going to deposit it, so I opened up the card and went to check my money. I know only have $250 in it. Nobody as far as I know has been in our apartment since yesterday, so naturally I’m coming to the conclusion that he took it. I brought it up again and he got extremely angry for accusing him again. 

Now, the only logical explanation besides my boyfriend taking the money is that for some reason my mom and/or aunt somehow broke into our apartment either when we went for dinner that night or while we were sleeping (for context my mom does have a key). But also, WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT. The most baffling thing to me is it’s not a large amount of money, it’s only 6 bills. So whoever took it would have had to have know. That I’d figure it out. 

So, am I the asshole for coming to this conclusion? ",3,1765046275.0,AITA_Relationships,2,1.0,False

When I (F34) drink a single cup of coffee with cream and sugar, I feel like I cannot think straight. I am more argumentative and hypomanic. I then eventually crash within about 3 hours. At this point, I feel incredibly hungry, achy, and ill as if I had a minor virus. I generally feel mildly yucky for the rest of the day.

I regularly drink tea between 8-24 oz a day with minimal to no issues. I only sometimes add sugar and milk to my tea. We live in interior Alaska and my coffee sensitivity seems to get worse this time of year when we get about 4-5 hours from sunrise to sunset. I also typically develop an aversion to sweets and desserts. My uncle who has the strongest reaction lives around Detroit. I spent much of my life before this in Texas and while not drinking much coffee, never noticed this extreme issue until moving to Alaska at age 30.",0,1765045944.0,NoStupidQuestions,4,0.33,False

Apologies for the long post. It's a throwaway account for a reason. Thank you in advance for reading and providing thoughtful comments.

Background:

I'm a male immigrant who's worked and lived in the US for almost 10 years. The first time (4 months for work) that I was in the US, I was located in a smaller city in the Midwest and became friends with a family (husband, wife and an infant) through a common friend. We hit it off, hung out a lot, and over that summer I was introduced and became friends with the entire extended family (parents, siblings, siblings' spouses and kids on both sides).

We kept in touch even after I returned home from my work travel and remained great friends.

Eventually, a couple of years later, I moved to the US permanently but lived in a different city. I would see them a couple of times every year but definitely over the holidays as they had now become more like family than just friends.

Over the years, we have taken trips together. They've, along with some family, and friends, visited my home country a couple of years back and we also went to Europe earlier this year during their son's (the infant I met is almost a teenager now) Spring Break.

My parents and sibling really likes them even though they've hardly spent much time in person. They're also grateful that I've a family away from home in a country that I didn't grow up in. I'm also extremely fond of them and love both their sons (they have a younger son who's school-aged and I've known him his whole life).

They've been extremely helpful over the years helping me with questions, with life, and everything that comes with moving to a completely different country as an adult. During that work trip when I first met them, they had taken me grocery shopping, helped me find a cell phone connection, answered all my questions, and of course made me feel welcome and like family. When I moved permanently, even though they weren't in the same city, they helped by answering questions, providing recommendations and providing social and cultural context when I had questions. (They have never had to help me financially. This is just for context as I'm sure people might wonder. Also, I'm not an exchange student thus they're not my host family or anything like that). I am beyond grateful for their support and have always been thankful to God/universe/higher power for this connection.

Present:

Earlier this year, I had the opportunity with work to move to their city. They weren't the only reason but a major reason that I chose to relocate. Work and career goals were the other reasons.

Even though we live in the same city, I live close to work and in downtown as I'm in a long-distance relationship, middle aged, no kids, in upper management at work so extremely busy, no drama, no toxic relationships/dating etc. I live close to work so that I can walk there daily, which provides me the right balance of exercise, social connection, and sunshine (not for the next 5 months apparently lol). I enjoy volunteering, trying new restaurants, travelling, working out, learning new things, credit card points and miles, and various other things. My gf lives in a major city that's a 3 hours drive, 30 minutes flight and we're trying to bridge that gap in the next year.

Issues:

Several years back, during Christmas when I was visiting my friends, I found a small brown Santa soft toy in my stocking. I thought it was a gag gift. I'm pretty easy going and look at the lighter side of things so even though I thought it was weird, my friends were laughing and so I took it as funny. It didn't stop there. Over the next years, I got brown Santa coffee mugs, brown Nutcracker statues, brown Santa things to hang, brown Santa ornaments, brown Santa figurines etc. These gifts always made me feel weird but my friends kept thinking it is funny. I told myself that it's not something for me to get upset about and ruin our friendship however they also got me a brown Nutcracker when they visited my home country. I was aghast and told them that I don't want any more of these gifts. I said it politely but firmly. They just laughed and said that the items were cute etc. Since I made it clear, they keep sending me photos of brown Santa/Christmas items while they're holiday shopping and asking me if they can get them for me. Things like brown Santa portraits, figurines, mugs, signs, etc. Every time I politely and firmly decline. Every time, it is met with ohh but it would look great in your apartment kind of texts and comments. I've actively reduced the time I spend with my friends and their family for several other reasons (I won't delve into those) however I don't feel comfortable or welcome as I used to. 

Last evening, I went to celebrate Christmas with their family. They celebrate early as their parents are snow birds. I got presents for most of them who I interact with and have a great friendship with. I like thoughtful presents and spend hours researching or asking for recommendations. Since I didn't grow up here buying presents is stressful for me as it is not just expensive but also very time intensive as I want those presents to be meaningful, somewhat useful and something that will bring happiness to the receiver. (I've made mistakes with not so good/useful gifts in the past but my friends have never complained).

I was handed a present yesterday by the older son and I gave him a hug and thanked him. The gift was wrapped and his mom (my friend) wanted me to unwrap it. She told me he picked and wrapped it himself. I was very moved as I've known this little human since when he was an infant. The gift was a brown Santa soap dispenser. I cannot describe my emotions when I saw it. In spite of several times and a couple of years of telling them that I don't want such gifts they thought it was totally okay. I've never felt this disrespected and my boundaries overstepped. I didn't say anything except for the fact that I didn't need this. My friend kept speaking about how they were not allowed by me to get me these things but they figured their son can. She also added that at this point it's a joke!!! I left the party wondering if it was not a joke at some point of time and they wanted me to feel racially attacked and I didn't?

Questions for this community:
1. What do you think is the best course of action from here onwards?
3. Can this situation be redeemed or do I continue to choose to ignore things to maintain our friendship?
4. Should I eventually show this post to them?

(2025),"Hello everyone! As always, I'd like to thank you all for your votes and comments under my last post about Irene Fleming- I hope that she will be found soon.

  
Today I'd like to highlight a very recent disappearance case.



BACKGROUND

  
Jonathan Hong was 21 when he went missing from Arlington, Washington, USA.

  
He lived with his parents and one of two sisters.

  
Jonathan was enrolled in a transition program at Weston High School in Arlington, meant to help disabled students.

  
Jonathan was autistic, and described to function on the level of 8-9 year old. His parents acquired emergency guardianship over him, as it was determined that he will need some level of assistance his whole life. Jonathan's family gave him different opportunities to move away from home while still having assistance in his daily life, but Jonathan prefered to stay with his parents. His older sister was ready to look after Jonathan if/when the time came. Jonathan was very much a homebody and his home was the place he wanted to be- he never ran away or expressed any desire to leave. 



He was described as ""verbal"", as he was capable of responding to his own name or having a simple conversation or asking for food/water/to use the restroom, but he struggled with problem solving or asking for complex help. Jonathan had sent his first text message only two weeks before he went missing. He learned that skill in his transition program in high school. Jonathan set up a personal email acoount with the help of his teachers shortly before he went missing- his teacher said that Jonathan lacked the executive functioning to create a personal email account without assistance. 



He didn't know how money works, or how to read a map; He also didn't have a bus pass and didn't know how to drive. Jonathan was capable of eating food from the pantry, heating up prepared food and making sandwiches, but he didn't know how to make food without assistence. He struggled with complex problem solving and had a tendency to shut down when stressed.

  
His interests included ""walking, relaxing, and food & drink"". Jonathan's favorite restaurants and food were ""Red Robin, Buffalo Wild Wings, Olive Garden, Starbucks, coffee stands, root beer floats, banana shakes, lotus drinks, Italian sodas, and any kind of snack"". When his loved ones asked him about what he wanted for birthday or chrismas, he often wanted to go out to eat.

  
Jonathan was also a gamer. He had an IPad (though all the apps he used required parental permission to download). He also owned a nintendo switch- his favorite game series were Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros, and Legend of Zelda. Jonathan also loved minecraft. His parents said that he didn't have a roblox or discord account.

  
In the past, Jonathan has faced online bullying through his IPad. His family tried to convince him to stop engaging with people online.

  
His other interest was cryptids and modern folklore. Jonathan liked to reaserch them on youtube (though he didn't have his own account).

  
Jonathan's favorite books were Captain Underpants, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and Last Kids on Earth. He had a silly sense of humor and deeply loved the family dog, a yorkie named Lady.

  
Ever since he was a child, Jonathan prefered the company of adults over other children or peers. His social circle was very small- it only included his family (extended and immediate), teachers and school staff, his classmates, and his neighbours. He was encouraged to expand that circle, but he was quiet among strangers and rarely initaited a conversation. He was described as ""trusting"" and viewed all adults as authority figures- he'd often ask for permission to, for example, go on a walk when he was at home, or to drink water when he was at school. His father, Theo Hoang, said that his son was very ""submissive"" to figures of authority, and if an adult told him to do something, he'd do it.

  
Like many autistic people, Jonathan didn't like loud noises, but he wasn't very reactive- his coping mechanism was isolation in cozy, quiet places, like his bedroom. When he got anxious, Jonathan usually went on a walk or paced. 

  
He had a habit of going on daily walks, always going by the same route (from his home to the school bus stop and back). Jonathan never deviated from that route, and even crossed the street in exactly the same spots in exactly the same way. He was always respectful of other people's property and never left the road.

  
Jonathan's family said that he was ""gentle, kind, funny, and so loved"".

  
Thao Hoang described his son as a ""gentle soul — a happy, kind, polite young man with no ill feelings towards anybody. He just doesn’t have a, you know, anything bad ever to say about anybody. I think he always think the best of people. I wish I’m more like him; I’m not. So, I guess, in a nutshell, he’s the kind of person that you wish there’s more people — or souls — like him in the world.”



DISAPPEARANCE

  
Jonathan was last seen on the 30th of March at 7:30 PM at his home at the 18500 block of 114th Drive NE in Arlington. He approached Thao, who was doing his daily run on the threadmill, and asked if he could sleep in the guest bedroom downstairs that night, arguing that the threadmill was noisy and that he won't be able to fall asleep. Thao said that the run will only take an hour and that he will be done before Jonathan's bedtime- after that, Jonathan went back to his room.

  
Later that evening, Jonathan came to his father again and asked him if he can stay home from school tomorrow due to not feeling well. Thao told him that they'll see how he'll feel next day and decide then. Jonathan agreed and went to his room. 

  
Around 8 PM, a few minutes after Jonathan last came to Thao, he tried to get downstairs. Thao, who was finishing up his threadmill exercise, asked Jonathan where he was going, to which Jonathan answered ""I'm going to bed"", like he decided that he will sleep in the guest bedroom after all. Thao found it a bit odd, but didn't think much of it.

  
Around 6:30 AM on the 31st, Thao got a call from his wife. She asked if he'll take Jonathan to the bus stop so that he could go to school, but Thao was already at work by then. The two hung up, but a few minutes later Thao's wife called him again, saying that Jonathan wasn't in his bed. Thao told her that he's probably sleeping in the guest bedroom. After another few minutes, Thao's wife called him again, saying that she can't find Jonathan anywhere. That is when Thao told her to call the police. 

  
Thao left work and went straight home- he arrived around 8 AM. The police was already there when he got there.



At some point during the night, Jonathan had left the house, most likely using the back doors. He left with his mother's slip-on shoes and his IPad (which was unusual, since he only took it outside for long car or plane rides). His family would've been notified if the IPad connected to wi-fi, but by the 2nd of April, police believed that it was out of battery- it's currently described as being in ""lost"" mode. There has been no activity at any of Jonathan's known Apple, Google or Microsoft accounts, and Apple was unable to track the IPad using the ""Find my"" app. 



Jonathan also left all of his jackets behind; It's unusual for him, as he always had one when outside, even in 90F (32.2C) heat. He used them as a sort of security blanket and pulled up the hood when he felt overwhelmed. A pair of wired earbuds he used when he used his IPad was also missing from home.

  
An Endangered Missing Persons Alert went out on the 3rd of April, 5 days after Jonathan went missing.

  
Local searches for Jonathan spanned for 10 days. They were called off due to a lack of leads. The SCSO said that they've followed up on all the leads and looked through the cellphone and computer Jonathan left behind at home, but found no interesting info.

  
On the 23rd of June, Jonathan showed up on a security cameras of three homes in Kirkland, about 43.2 miles (\~70 km) from Arlington, in the South Juanita area near 105th Avenue Northeast and Northeast 112th Street, between 11PM and 12AM. Jonathan appeared to be confused and lost, but is notably clean and groomed. He was also seen making vocal stims (repetitive sounds some autistic people make to calm themselves). Notably, one of the houses had a similar address to his home address; Jonathan was still learning his own address, but it seems plausible that he would be drawn to a home with a similar one and get confused, given the fact that it was in a different city.

  
CONCLUSION

  
Jonathan's family believes that he was lured by someone and kidnapped. They don't want people to dismiss his disappearance as ""elopment"", which some autistic people do, as Jonathan never showed that paticular trait. He was always set into his routines and prefered being in familiar environments. The family believes that he was in Kirkland with someone, but they somehow split (Jonathan ran off, was released, or was allowed to walk up to the homes). They have stated that they harbor no ""ill will"" or ""malice"" towards his abductor, and that they only want their son and brother back. 

  
After the June sighting was confirmed, it's speculated that Jonathan was under the care of someone since the 30th of March to 23rd of June. From then on he's either still under someone's care or he's on his own. It's technically possible, but highly unlikely, that he made it to Kirkland by himself.

  
On the 11th of April, Jonathan's family filed a formal complaint against the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office regarding their handling of the case. In a chain of emails a Snohomish County sergeant named Det. William Westsik told the Washington State Patrol’s Missing and Unidentified Persons Unit that Jonathan “is not being considered an endangered missing person,” adding that he “is able to effectively navigate public transit"", which is blatantly false to anyone who knows Jonathan. The press and police have consistently refered to Jonathan as ""high functioning"", which might've distorted the way the public percieved Jonathan and how much support he actually required.

  
Jonathan's family have contacted ICE, but they have stated that nobody fitting Jonathan's description or name is being held at one of their facilities. The family doesn't believe in ""psychics, tarot card readers, highly intuitive premonitions, visions, or any other metaphysical manifestations"", and doesn't want their help, as they prefer to focus on concrete leads.

  
There is a $100,000 reward for information leading to his location.

  
Jonathan Hoang was 21 when he went missing and would be 22 now. He's a mixed race (White/Asian) man, 5'10"" (70 inch / 178 cm) and 135 lbs (61 kg). He has brown hair and brown eyes. He has a large mole on his right inner forearm and two moles on the left side of his face. He walks with a distinctive gait (but this is more easily identified by those who know him). Sometimes, Jonathan will walk with his hands held behind his back, or he will have them straight forward with bent arms and clenched fists.

  
If you have any info about Jonathan's whereabouts, contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)

  
If you see Jonathan, take a photo or a video for eventual use later. Then, approach calmly and ask him if he's Jonathan- if he confirms, call 911, and then contact Crime Stoppers, IN THAT ORDER! Stay with him or keep him in your sight untill help arrives. Keep in mind that he might be scared or confused- tell him that you're here to help get home and see his family. Be calm and kind, don't intimidate him. Don't assume that he's travelling alone. He might appear homeless, disoriented, or like he has mental illness. Occasionally, Jonathan will talk to himself.

Last week I walked into Google’s Hyderabad office because of a startup I’ve been building for a few years. It still feels bizarre typing this.

I wasn’t there as an employee or visitor. I got invited for a Telangana startup event. They picked a few startups from the Northeast and mine somehow made the cut.

Inside Google, I ended up talking to product managers and regional heads. Not in a “motivational event” way but actual back-and-forth conversations. They asked about the problems we’re facing and gave real advice. That part hit me more than the office itself.

Because honestly. I’ve been building my startup, Fueler, from random apartments and coworking spaces, coffee shops. No funding. No fancy founder lifestyle. Just a lot of rejection emails and figuring stuff out on the go.

So sitting in that room. Coming from where I come from. It messed with my head a bit. In a good way.

For anyone from a small town, tier-2 or tier-3 city, or any place where “big opportunities” don’t show up easily. I just want to say this: the internet is your cheat code. You don’t have to wait for permission or a location advantage. It’s not easy, but it’s possible.

If anyone here is building something from a place where most people don’t dream big. I get you. If you have questions about the Google visit, the startup program, or building from a small town, happy to share //

Also. If you're working on your career and need to show your work somewhere, Fueler lets you build a portfolio for free. It’s my attempt at making things a bit more fair for people like us who come from small towns

This is a throwaway account,and also my first time posting, as i’ve been having some issues and feel like this is a safe space to put this up.  Also, sorry this is so long. I (16Nonbinary), and Lisa (fake name,16F) are classmates. I came out to her, as she used to be my best friend, last year as nonbinary and bisexual (which was very hard for me).  That was, in January. In Febuary, I broke up with my at the time boyfriend of a 8 months, as i felt I was a little suffocated.  
For some context, Lisa and i go to the same school, and have been friends since 3rd grade. My school is very small, so everyone knows everyone. I also do theatre (yes im a theatre kid) with Lisa, and some of the kids from my theatre group are in my class.

Now, back to the story. In March, I had some issues with my friends, and march-april had close to no friends. It was around this time, when i got diagnosed with my anxiety disorde, and Lisa  knew this. In May, i met Mark (16M) at a coffee shop, and we instantly hit it off.  A few weeks later, he asks me to be his girlfriend (i was not out to him), and the (literally) first thing I did was call Lisa and tell her. She was, extatic. This was when, I also reconnected with some old friends of mine. Me and one of those friends, went shopping, and they were trying on some clothes. Lisa called me, and I answered, while shopping with that friend. At some point in our call, she heard me say, That looks so good on you, and Your so cute in that. That was innocent shopping with my friend. She misunderstood that, and guess what?! The next day, i get a call from Mark, who was practically yelling at me, and told me we were over. I was on vacation at the time, and only saw the text from Lisa later, who was apologizing and saying how she didn’t know and thought i cheated. These texts will be provided.

The next week, one of my theatre group friends had a party, where I left a couple hours early. The next day, after that party, as i’m reading our group chat, i realized someone said something about me at the party. I texted Lisa, who told me “Whatever happens in Marks house, stays in his house”. Yes, that was Marks party. I texted Mark, who hadn’t blocked me, who told me the same thing. By that point, i had already figured out that they were badmouthing me about me being Bi.

This is where it gets interesting. On Monday in school, Lisa, as she’s in my class, told some other classmates that i’m Bi. I came up to her, when i found out she did that and practically yelled “What is wrong with you” in her face. She also said that same thing (referring to my gender and sexuality). After that we went no contact for a little while. Later , I texted her, asking why she did it (all of that) and she said it’s because I told my class about her and her ex boyfriend. For some more context here, Lisa had a boyfriend, and she got mildly bullied for it at school, with people teasing her about him. I told her I did no such thing, and that if anything, I have the right for being mad at her, as I got teased for my ex (yes she told my class about him). I got mad at her, and haven’t texted her since. Come September of this year, and she hates me now. She has started making comments, about my appearance (i have a more Alt style, and dyed hair) and practically turned my entire class against me. Because of this my mental health has gotten really bad. Yesterday, i couldnt take it anymore, and snapped. When she made her first comment, i told her how she was wierd for saying that and that i got used to it and she should too, and some other things. She started crying and ran out of the classroom. I feel kinda bad, but idk, so here i am.

Any recommendations for a spot to go?","Well lads, as the title suggests, I’ve broken free from the cycle of dating apps and algorithms and done something scientists have thought impossible for Neanderthals like myself… Asked a girl out in person. Not only that, asked her out in the gym too. Was a bold move and I think my arse fell out of my jocks mid-conversation only to be sucked back up once she said yes. I think my brain started buffering like a YouTube video as well but listen we got there in the end. She said she normally doesn’t date people from the gym but I guess my fairly bang average workouts, lack of cardio, and 3 gym shirts have impressed her enough.

I don’t want to put her under loads of pressure or come off strong but she seems really lovely (and is also incredibly gorgeous) so I’d like to have a nice first time to get to know each other. 

My usual dating apps first date is a couple of drinks and then for a second date (if there is one), do an activity/dinner etc.

I don’t want to fall victim to overthinking here so should I play it safe and go for something similar or maybe a coffee? Is dinner a bit much? Keep it simple with drinks? 

I’m located on the Southside near enough to town so there’s a good few places around, but if anyone has particularly good recommendations, I’d love to hear them. Also maybe a Christmas themed date perhaps?

On a sidenote: I’d also like gym recommendations in case this goes poorly and I have to disappear into the night like Jason Bourne.

• Kingrinder K6 (hovering between 80-90 clicks for this roast)

• 1 cup plastic V60

• Crystal Geyser water

• 250g to 15g water, ~198F - 205F. Bloom, pour to 150g, wait 10 seconds then pour the rest. Drawdown finishing between 2:30 and 3:00 depending on grind. 

I have a feeling it comes down to pour technique, as is almost the case for me.. just having a hard time dialing it in. My adjustments have been to go a bit coarser, lower temp and with less agitation (gentle, slow spirals) and while that’s given me a bit more sweetness, the bitter aftertaste remains.

I take the same bus to work every morning, and I always sit in the same seat, second row, window side, because the sunlight makes me feel less like a zombie. One day I get on, and some guy is sitting in my seat. Not a big deal, but you know how it throws off your whole routine?

He looked up at me, smiled, and said, “Oh, sorry, is this yours?”  
I laughed and said no, but inside I was like… yes. Yes it is.

The next day, he was there again. Same seat. Same smile.  
And somehow we ended up sitting together, talking about random things, music, the weather, how both of us pretend to like mornings.

This turned into a regular thing.  
Same bus.  
Same seat.  
Same guy.

He started waiting for me at the stop. I don’t know if he meant to, but every time I arrived he’d look relieved, like he wasn’t sure I’d show up. We didn’t exchange numbers. We didn’t even know each other’s last names. But the conversations became the best part of my day.

Then… he disappeared.

Three days. No him. No smile. No seat thief. I felt stupid for noticing, but I caught myself checking every stop, every face, hoping he’d get on.

On the fourth day, he rushed onto the bus out of breath, saw me, and said:

“I’m sorry. I thought you might think I just stopped caring.”

Stopped caring.  
Not “stopped talking,” not “stopped sitting with you”, caring.

My heart did something I’m pretty sure wasn’t medically safe.

We ended up getting off at a coffee shop instead of going straight to work. And we talked for over an hour. He told me he had wanted to ask for my number for weeks but didn’t want to “mess things up.”

We finally exchanged numbers… but here’s the part I need advice on:

He’s sweet. He’s gentle. He makes me laugh without trying.  
But he’s also a little shy. And I can’t tell if he wants something real or if this is just a cute bus thing we both romanticized too much.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Houston Rockets vs. Dallas Mavericks: A Tale of Two Teams (One Has More Legs Than the Other)**

The Dallas Mavericks, currently nursing a 8-16 record like a bad cup of coffee, host the Houston Rockets in a back-to-back showdown that’s less “clash of titans” and more “please don’t let the Mavs’ injury report write the script.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a stat head and the humor of a guy who’s seen too many NBA timeouts.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Rockets Are the Obvious Choice (Unless You’re a Sadist)

The Rockets enter as a **-8.5 favorite** on the spread, with moneyline odds hovering around **1.27** (implying an 81% implied probability). For Dallas, the 3.85 odds (25% chance) are about as comforting as a seat cushion made of cardboard. But let’s not just take the books’ word for it.

* **Houston’s Defense**: The Rockets are allowing a mere **106.4 points per game** over their last 10, led by a defense that steals the ball more than a toddler in a candy store (**9.6 steals per game**). Their focus on containing stars like Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengün (both out for Dallas) means the Mavs’ offense—already a leaky faucet—will likely turn into a full-blown flood.
* **Dallas’ Injury Crisis**: The Mavericks are missing **Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, and four other rotation players**, including Daniel Gafford, who might as well be on loan to the injury reserve. Their starting five could be a mix of “here’s hope” and “good luck, kid,” with Ryan Nembhard (15.6 PPG, 68% from three) trying to fill multiple roles. It’s like asking a toaster to run a marathon.
* **The Spread**: Rockets -8.5 is a number that screams “cover this, or explain to the universe why you bet on the team with 10 injured players.”

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Rebounds, and Why the Rockets Are Still Standing

* **Houston’s Absences**: Alperen Sengün (out) and Tari Eason (out) are missed, but the Rockets have depth. Reed Sheppard, their rookie guard, is expected to shoulder more offensive load—good news for him, less so for the Mavericks’ porous defense. Dorian Finney-Smith’s January debut is a distant dream, so Houston’s perimeter defense will rely on… well, not much.
