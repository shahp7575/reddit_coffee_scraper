1ij18bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1ij18bl/coffee_culture_sucks/,Coffee culture sucks,"I should preface this by saying I‚Äôm in my mid 30‚Äôs and still don‚Äôt like coffee. Never liked it. My wife has made me try several coffee types/styles/brands because ‚Äúno THIS will be the one you like!‚Äù And no. Have yet to find anything that my palette enjoys unless it‚Äôs some Frappuccino loaded with chocolate made for a 5 year old at Starbucks. Every coffee I‚Äôve had always tastes watered down and just not enjoyable.

But that‚Äôs not what this post is about! I‚Äôm talking about the culture. To me it‚Äôs maybe like how most non smokers now view smokers at work. ‚ÄúWait they get a 15 min break whenever they want to go smoke?‚Äù (I know they don‚Äôt get unlimited smoke breaks but in practicality‚Ä¶ they do). Coffee drinkers are like that to me. Like are you that addicted and obsessed? 

‚ÄúCoffee breaks‚Äù at work. 
People ‚ÄúNEEDING‚Äù their coffee in the morning to function. 
‚ÄúOh yeah Larry can be kinda tough to get along with until he gets his first coffee in him‚Äù. 
I work in the airlines and it‚Äôs like insane to be a pilot without drinking coffee. It was sort of the same when I worked in the corporate office environment. Now we‚Äôre like running late to the gate and the other guy has GOT to stop and grab a coffee. 

Like a lot of you coffee drinkers have an actual problem. How do you know when an addition is a problem? When it starts affecting your day to day or those around you. If you‚Äôre a known douchebag in the morning until you get a coffee, it‚Äôs a problem. If you‚Äôre making people wait on you at work for a meeting or something, it‚Äôs a problem. We have 1000 errands to run today but we HAVE to stop at Starbucks first. It‚Äôs a problem. And unlike drugs and alcohol addictions, it‚Äôs totally normalized in today‚Äôs society since physically you‚Äôre not doing any personal harm to your body‚Ä¶. Except of course the caffeine addiction part or making your body filter all that crap. My dad has prostate issues and had to cut out coffee‚Ä¶ so it can‚Äôt be ‚Äúthat‚Äù harmless.

Sana wag to ipost sa ibang socmed please.
Last quarter of 2024, i decided to play ML. Hirap makaayat ng mataas na rank since wala akong kasama. In other words pabuhat ako yes pabuhat ako ü§£. Then last December i started to chat sa world chat i  said, pabuhat ako‚Äù 
Then may nag chat sakin bubuhatin daw ako sus tank din sya, eh support din ako. Naglaro kami isang beses. ang bigat nya kasama promise. 

In any case pagkatapos naming maglaro. Di na ako nakipaglaro sa kanya pro ini.invite parin ako usap lang daw kami sa labi. So ayun nag chat kami getting to know each other. Then i found out na single sya (which is a lie) tapos 2 hrs away lng sya sa place ko. And he knows that too. Told him i was single mom. His working as a bodyguard. I dont discriminate his job. Since i dont care. Until lumalim usapan namin. Napunta kami sa ilang ang body count ko which is 2. I asked the same thing to him. He said 7. Tsk. 

After that we went too far like i told him what i do, whats my business. What i do in a boring day, linis bahay, gym, at ml lang ako pag walang kailangan sa business. Ayun nag cha-chat kami araw araw until,

Until napunta kami sa fb(naka profile lock ang gago) humingi na sya sakin ng nudes. Ako naman im not confident sa start di ko pa nagawa yun. But i did it eventually, it started with just no bra with tshirt, nasarapan ang gago malaki daw utong ko. Syempre may anak na ako. 
Then next i gave with bra but just wearing singlet, sabi naman nya malaki daw. (Di po talaga malaki at di rin maliit, nah push bra lang) until wala na talagang takip. So i gave it then i ask him kng okay lang bah ang utong ko gustong gusto nga at ma pink pink daw, nag jakol then sya pucha ang sarap ng nutz nya maugat. Napansin ko rin parang na mamaniac na ako sa tt nya. Sabi ko yawa namimiss ko na ang oten. Nagjajacol sya habang nag sesex chat kami ang daming tamod. Pro na tuturn of ako sa face nga üòÇü§£‚úåÔ∏è. Pro masarap tignan titi nyah. Pag nag bibidyokol kami pinapakita ko mountains ko walang mukha cuz im scared na ma blackmail. Di ko din binigay real fb ko since i used that for my business. In other words he dont know me but he still wanted to know me and have vsex with me. Humingi narin pala sya ng video ng v ko, di ko binigay kaloka. Sabi nya unfair daw sa kanya, nagbibigay at nagpapakita sya na nagjajakol at alam nyang nasasarapan ako oo namimiss ko talaga oten eh, pinigilan ko lang. may mga times na basang basa na ako di ko alam gagawin. Naghuhugas na ako ng puke ko at pinapasiritan ko ng shower üöø nalalabasan din ako. Tapos umaalis ako nag rirides kahit saan stop over coffee shop. Or punta ako sa gym para ma de stress.

Until one time i ask him to accept me as a friend sa fb. Sabi nya di raw poide. Pucha married na pala yung gago found out this december bago mag bagong taon, nawalan na ako ng gana sa kanya.
Nagsesend parin sya ng nudes (alam nya kahinaan ko üòÖ nag rereply padin ako. Sorry nah) 

Sabi nya sakin. Sa akin na raw sya titira tanggap nya ako at ang anak ko, magbagong buhay na daw sya kasama ako. Sya na daw mag maintenance sa business ko. (Tsk ako din ata i me maintenance nya ) dito daw kami sa place ko since wala sya masyadong kakilala dito. Sa akin na raw sya magtratrabaho, as in nainlab ako sa gago. O malibog lang siguru ako. Oo naging malibog ako nung nakausap ko sha. I started to watch porn. Naadik na ako tapos nag shoshower. Hahays ang hirap.
Before new year i told him nah we should stop this. I dont want to be a mistress. Its not my worth. I dont want to be a reason of ruining his family. Then sabi nya wala silang anak. Di daw magkakaanak asawa nya. Sa akin nalang kamo sya at bibigyan ko daw sya ng anak? Lala ng isip. Sabi ko ayaw ko nang magkaanak, malaki na anak ko tapos na ako jan.
The whole end of December is on and off chat kasi nakokonsensya ako sa asawa nya. At the same time gusto ko ng titi nya. Sorry girls i made a mistake. (Online)

But bago nag bagong taon. Yung papunta sya sa province he wants me to come with him. And i didnt i have my own party in my place and my parents and siblings are coming. And prepared for everything so he thought of coming to my place. Which is i did not allowed. I dont want to disappoint my parents again.

Tapos nag sisend parin sya ng titi nya. Ako naman patay malisya. And i finished him. I told him nah change yourself be a better husband to your wife. I can‚Äôt do this anymore. Let‚Äôs move 2025 and repent for sins we made.(online) 

Now it‚Äôs been like 37 days since i block him. I am thinking of him, sorry po. In that 37days nag watch ako ng porn and tinatapos ko parin sa shower. I am planning to buy a toy, still a thought cuz i dont know how.

Honestly nakakaadik sya. Di ako ganito nalilibog ako ng wala sa oras specially when i touch my nipple yes i do touch my mountains. I love that feeling, feeling ko ang sexy2 ko char,

Yun lang confession ko. And i am thankful na nakapagpigil ako. Pro ang maniac ko magwawatch ng porn üò∞ one day i will stop. ",1,1738844153.0,MayConfessionAko,0,1.0,False

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Clich√© Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing clich√© in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clich√©s with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

1ij14gc,https://i.redd.it/1zcofg3xfihe1.png,DevBlog #54: Post engine rework bug-fixing,"‚ÄãHello and welcome to another WalkScape devblog!
‚Äã

Last week we released the massive work that had been going for the last couple months, reworking the game engine, our servers and more. As expected, this amount of changes came with some bugs that were not spotted in our internal testing. For the next week or two, we'll focus on fixing the issues. A list of the issues that are currently known is here: 
‚Äã

[Reddit post of known issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/s/DaAjuWriX3)
‚Äã

This development blog post will be a bit shorter one than usually, as post-release our main priorities are to fix any issues or bugs that arise, so there aren't much news to share.


# Buy Me a Coffee fix


Buy Me a Coffee had an issue due to their APIs being quite buggy. We've now deployed a fix to this, and anyone who were previously having an issue with their BMAC supporter tier not showing up should now have it working. The speed that BMAC is connected to WalkScape account should also be quicker.
‚Äã

Please let us know if you still have an issue with BMAC by contacting our email!
‚Äã
# Anti-cheat improvements


With the engine rework, we've also released our improved anti-cheat. 
‚Äã

The new system has shown some really great results, and we've banned a bunch of players that we've caught cheating in the game. We're very happy with the new system, and it should support hundreds of thousands or even millions of players, so definitely a lot more scalable than our previous solutions. Our new anri-cheat also can be more easily improved over time, which is also a great things.
‚Äã

Most of the time, I like to stay quite tight lipped about our anti-cheat development so that potential cheaters can't prepare for what we're working on. However, a lot of people are always quite skeptical if fitness games are able to run anti-cheat measures effectively. I think it's mostly due to people's experience with Pokemon Go, and how badly it was handled there.
‚Äã

We take cheating very seriously, and will keep improving our anti-cheat as much as possible, and already have some effective solutions in place. And  it's definitely possible to build anti-cheat solutions for games like these!
‚Äã

# Short term plans


Like covered in the previous development blog post, we'll be fixing the bugs for next week or two until we have the game stable again. Then, I'll be moving onto building our new improved development tools (devtools 2.0) so we can start delivering new content again!
‚Äã

We already have art and designs for multiple new content updates, and our goal with devtools 2.0 is to remove any bottenecks from developing and releasing new content of the game. Maxchill and floursifter have been hard at work, and we can't wait to get these things released!
‚Äã

# Until next time


That's it for this time!
‚Äã

Considering how massive this rework was:
[Github merge](https://i.postimg.cc/4dCxy36K/image.png)


It goes without saying that we were expecting a lot of issues, but I'm actually surprisesurprised how few there were. The biggest and most tricky issue to solve is the issue we have with the new server tech, where there's a memory leak. This results in the server restarting every 5 hours or so, so if you're having hard time connecting it's often resolved if you try again in few minutes.
‚Äã

Thanks for the patience, and we'll keep working on fixing the new issues! I might include a couple small QoL improvements here and there too - we have a pretty good list of suggested small improvements that wwouldn't take that long to implement. I already implemented a few in this update: banking from the bank button in inventory, starting actuvities from the world map, wardrobes in all settlements, and so on.

I never thought I'd be posting here, but I desperately need to vent. My husband of 12 years has transformed from a reasonable conservative into what I can only describe as a Trump cult member, and it's destroying our marriage.

Our house has become a literal shrine to Trump. I wish I was exaggerating. There's a 6-foot Trump cardboard cutout in our living room that he talks to every morning like some sort of religious ritual. Our walls, once decorated with family photos, are now plastered with Trump flags. He even replaced our American flag with a ""Trump 2024 or Death"" banner. My kids are embarrassed to have friends over.

Last week was the final straw. He spent $3,000 of our savings on ""limited edition"" Trump gold-plated coins and a ""certified authentic"" piece of Mar-a-Lago toilet paper. THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. When I confronted him about taking money from our children's college fund, he said ""Trump University will be reopened and make education great again."" I couldn't make this shit up if I tried.

Every dinner conversation somehow turns into a Trump sermon. He'll randomly shout ""STOP THE STEAL"" during family meals. When our 15-year-old daughter got an A+ on her history project about the Civil War, he accused her teacher of being a ""communist infiltrator"" for not teaching ""the truth about Trump's victory.""

Our bedroom... God, I'm mortified to even type this. He insists on keeping a giant Trump portrait above our bed because ""Trump watches over us."" He even got a Trump tattoo on his chest and keeps trying to convince me to get one too. He calls it his ""Mark of Patriotism.""

His entire personality has been consumed. He changed his wardrobe to only red clothing. He refers to himself as a ""Digital Soldier"" and spends hours posting on Truth Social. When I asked him to help with our son's homework, he said he was too busy ""fighting the deep state online.""

The paranoia is getting worse. He installed cameras around our house to ""watch for Antifa."" He thinks our neighbors are ""deep state agents"" because they have a pride flag. He threw out our coffee maker because ""Starbucks is funding the radical left."" He even accused our golden retriever of being ""suspiciously woke"" because she didn't bark at a Biden commercial.

Our sex life? He insists on playing Trump rally speeches in the background and keeps trying to get me to wear a Melania mask. I wish I was joking. He has different MAGA hats for different occasions - including one specifically for ""bedroom patriot time."" I'm dying inside.

I found receipts showing he's donated over $15,000 to various Trump-related causes this year alone. Money we needed for our mortgage. When I showed him our overdue bills, he said ""Trump will fix the economy and make us rich."" We're facing foreclosure, but he keeps buying Trump merchandise.

Yesterday, he announced he's legally changing his name to ""Donald J. Trump Smith"" and wants our kids to follow suit. Our 10-year-old son started crying, and my husband told him ""real patriots don't cry"" and made him watch four hours of rally footage as ""testosterone training.""

I've tried everything - marriage counseling (he called the therapist a socialist), family interventions (he disowned his own mother for suggesting he get help), even pleading with his Trump-supporting friends to tell him he's going too far. Nothing works. He just goes deeper into the rabbit hole.

The worst part? Under all this Trump worship, I know my real husband is still in there somewhere. Sometimes, late at night, I catch glimpses of the man I married. But then morning comes, he puts on his MAGA hat, salutes the Trump cutout, and the cycle begins again.

Edit: Please stop DMing me about joining your ""Trump Wives Support Group."" I appreciate the thought, but I'm not interested in your MLM scheme selling Trump-themed essential oils.

Edit 2: Yes, I've already hidden our important documents and started a secret savings account. And no, I won't sell you his ""rare"" Trump toilet paper, even if you're offering Bitcoin.

Edit 3: To the people saying ""this can't be real"" - I wish I was creative enough to make this up. Come visit for dinner sometime. Hope you like hamberders while watching Tucker Carlson reruns on loop.",3,1738842810.0,copypasta,0,0.8,False
1ij0spk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ij0spk/i_need_to_complain_about_my_wife/,I need to complain about my wife,"My wife has the day off today. She dropped her daughter off with a friend's mother who took her and her daughter to school. My wife and I then were at home alone, and we had a nice time together for about an hour.

She then went to coffee with the girl's mother a couple hours later. I stayed home and did some work and also looked for cockatiels online as we have been looking for a bird. I happened to find a really good option, but I know they go fast, so I needed my wife to call soon since I don't speak Polish.

My wife told me the other day that it is okay for me to ask her for her help in finding a bird. So, when she got home, I told her about the bird and that I was very interested, and I asked if she could call the guy, get more information, and perhaps set up an appointment. She immediately started complaining. She complained that she had no time to herself, and then I was demanding all of her time. I literally needed five minutes of her time for something that was really important to me (I had a 15 year-old cockatiel who died last year that I was very close to) and for something that she explicitly offered to do. When I took her up on her offer, and she complained. The other day when she offered, I told her thank you, and but I was concerned she would complain if I asked for her help, so I was hesitant to ask her. She said not to worry and that it was okay if I ask for her help. But, exactly as predicted, she in fact did complain the moment I asked. I don't feel safe, asking this woman for help. And quite frankly, I don't want anymore help from her. Part of the reason for involving her was also to connect with her -- she has asked me so many times in our relationship to rely on her more, but when I do, I have to listen to her complaints. This is exhausting.

And when I call her out on this, she totally turns it around on me, saying that she never has time for herself and that I always expect everything now. In reality, she texts me often while I am working and asks me for help with things, and I'm helping even before I start working (I work evenings).

This is where her daughter learns her behavior -- from her mother; she models my wife's behavior. This is why her daughter complains all the time -- because my wife complains all the time. I also called my wife out on this.

Seriously, when my wife tells me that I can ask her for help, I don't trust her. I don't want to ask for her help. Most times when I do, she complains. I'm sick of this. I'm seriously sick of this crap.

Honestly, I'm extremely hesitant to go get a bird. I feel like we're going to break up soon after, and then I will have to get rid of the bird (I cannot take it across country borders if I leave).

I once again find myself asking: Do I really want to remain in a relationship with this woman? Yes, there are a lot of good times, but there are also an equal number of bad times. It's absolutely exhausting. It's like playing Russian roulette where the odds are 50%; there is a 50% chance she will explode.

I knew I shouldn't have asked for her help. She just explodes out of me out of nowhere. We have a nice time, and then she just is a total b**** to me. Seriously, I cannot stand this. I really do not look forward to the prospect of having to continue to deal with this b**** for the rest of my existence. And on top of that, having to deal with her daughter, who is even worse than her. Why the hell did I put myself in such a situation? I want out.

Jesus. And we were having such a nice day.

This happens 1-2 times per week. Everything is going great, and suddenly, out of nowhere, she just snaps. And then she complains that we fight often.

I have recently been trying to fast for 21 days, but I seemingly cannot get over the overwhelming urge to eat. If I don't eat, my brain will start constantly thinking about food, eating food, and craving food. Since I work around food, this eventually causes ego depletion and I can't seem to continue longer than three days fasting no matter how much I try to focus and ignore the desire to eat.

Strangely, I don't actually get hungry. Even up to day three, which is as far as I managed to fast. It's just a mental urge to eat. What I tried:

\* Drinking tea whenever I get a desire to eat  
\* Putting a single spoonful of powdered dry milk into my coffees. This did not work and in fact had the opposite effect of making me reason ""well I already had a bit of milk, I may as well eat.""

\* Writing down what urges I was having and trying to ""leave them behind"" on the paper.

\* Keeping myself busy. This fails because eventually I can't be busy anymore for whatever reason (e.g. sleep)

What do you do to overcome your desire to eat?

I'm religious and spiritual. I myself believe in certain superstition stuff which doesn't harm anyone but I oppose certain stuff which is totally insane . 
So one among my staffs is this guy who's job is to get coffee , get people seated and to do grocery shopping. He's illiterate and from rural area. He's a very innocent man with simply pure intentions.  We have provided him a house like 4 streets away from ours and he lives with his wife. 

Recently his brother along with his wife had come over to stay . They had never been to bigger city  and I thought it was for that reason .. ukn just roaming around etc etc . But then some of the neighbours over there dialled us telling "" ukn , u guys might wanna check on them because yesterday we heard a woman screaming non stop and a man yelling at her"" . Knowing our staff very well , we knew he would never do something like that but still when we enquired he said it's his brother's wife. 

So here's the thing . Apparently the girl ( brothers wife) gets possessed every night. She just beats the husband up and screams aloud saying she's gonna kill him etc etc.  The reason they bought her here is because they were told that in bigger city  people can easily get rid of the spirit possessing her. 

Hearing that I just went straight upto him and was like "" you shld probably get her checked with a psychiatrist not with someone who claims to shoo a spirt away"" but they wouldn't listen.  They firmly believe that it's a ghost n not a mental sickness.  

They have taken her back to their village since I was constantly asking them to stop doing whatever they were doing to that girl . Like literally they shoved a slipper in her mouth because some guy asked to , they have beaten her , made her eat chillies , given her cold showers in the middle of the night and what not !!! 

The staff refuses to tell me anything bout her now and ive stopped asking but ikn I could have done smtg there but only if they had kept her here more.  I'm planning to make my dad talking to him sooner bout it

But I personally feel that 
1) she's depressed and is in bad mental state 
2) she doesn't like the guy and maybe this is her way to keep him out of her bed as she might not wanna get intimate because she's just 21 and hes 40.  

Yeah they don't wanna take her to doctor because for them even having depression is equal to a person who lost entire mental stability and they would just abandon her , get the dude remarried.

The clock by my bedside glows 7:47 AM.

The sun should be up. The birds should be screaming. The world should be waking.  

I hear nothing.  

I rise, slow, deliberate. The floor is cold beneath my feet. I walk to the window.

I press my palm against the glass.

I blink.

The light outside is **wrong**.

Not morning, not night. Just. Wrong.

The sun is bleeding out. Hurt. **Screaming.** A raw wound, throbbing in a dying sky.

I stumble back. Try my phone. Dead. The wrong light illuminates my hands. I close the curtains.

I do not understand what this means.

*And my head throbs.*

I go to the bathroom, splash cold water on my face. The faucet runs. I feel it against my skin, slipping through my fingers. But it does not make a sound. I do not hear the water hit the sink.  

I do not hear my own breathing.  

I do not hear my own heartbeat.

I stagger into the living room, touching, seeing, feeling. Desperate.

The objects look familiar but feel alien under my fingertips. 

A coffee mug cold with yesterdays lies. A book whose words swim and squirm like drowning things. A clock that's run out of time.

*My skull is splitting.*

Then, in the corner of my eye.

A photo. In a frame. On a desk.

I stare.

The eyes inside stare back.

**They sing.**

*I slam my head against the wall.*

Memories begin to surface like bubbles in thick syrup. A dream about falling. The taste of mint toothpaste. The sound of a door closing. Normal things. Safe things. 

*Again.*

I cling to them. A drowning person to driftwood.

This must be a dream. Of course. Dreams don't have sound. Dreams don't make sense. Dreams feel real until you realize they're not.

*And again.*

I let out a silent laugh that tastes of copper and relief. How strange that I didn't see it sooner. Any moment now, I'll wake up. 

*Over.*

And the world will remember how to make noise.

*And over.*

It will right itself, will remember its own name, will remember mine.

*And over.*

The wrong light seeps under my eyelids like jaundiced honey. 

*And overagainoveragainoveragain‚Äî*

I feel my consciousness fade. Feel reality rising like a tide.

**Relief.**

\*\*\*

I wake up to silence.

 I'm 21 and I go outside and see people doing drugs, drinking a lot, etc. I just moved to a new city and girls I've tried making friends with largely are looking for sugar daddys which aren't my thing. The men have their own issues but one guy I briefly dated told me he felt like I was wasting my life and was a sad person because I wasn't having sex. I've been told I was wearing too many clothes and needed to show more because I looked marriedüò≠ 

I know it's just a difference of life habits, I think people can do what they want, but I usually end up crying over this stuff like it feels very overwhelming for me and I don't know why. 

It's like all I want is to be married and have a family, not in the weird way. Just a normal family and a simple life. Not immidately or anything but it's the goal, but it's like people think that's stupid now and I get shamed for liking my life the way it is. I walk my dog, i take photos throughout my day, i take my online classes at coffee shops, cook, go running, etc. Obviously not so simple, but it's my usual day. 

It's hard because I feel like even men avoid me for this. I've asked guy friends if there's something wrong with me that's deterring people because i rarely get approached and the ones that do arent really stable, if its maybe my apperance, but I've gotten responses like I'm one of the last few people that gives them hope, or I don't seem to realize how beautiful I am. 

One guy who... its a weird situation. He liked (likes?) me, I like him. He pursued me but i wasn't interested because he was promiscuous. The emotions were there but it just didnt make sense at the time. We've known eachother 5 years and when I asked if we could sleep together he didn't even want to *suprise Pikachu face* which like yes men can say no, but this man used to fuck anything that walked so i was like bruh rejection damage times 100, he's changed now, but when I confided in him about my issues in the new city he told me to just ""keep your values and try to stay the same, you're a good person"" 

Like i don't understand it's people telling me one thing but doing the other. They themselves doing ___ activity but telling me not to do it. It's stressful. I dont know what to believe or what to do or anything. I just feel like I'm missing this random code to life that everyone else seems to be following. ",1,1738841677.0,Life,1,1.0,False

About a week ago she saw me again and asked me for My # and If I was married or had kids,I said no to both,gave Her My # and she Immediately started texting Me,

Later on She asked If we could hang out on My days off,I said Yes and I decided to take Her snowmobiling up at the ski Hill. We continued to text throughout getting to know eachother(we do not live in the same town) and on the day I picked her up I remembered to bring Her some socks and a pair of boots because I knew it was cold up there and I didnt want Her to be cold,she seemed to be taken back by the act of kindness and we had fun snowmobiling and after we went for dinner,she asked me to sit beside her and we had a good meal,she insisted to pay talked some more and bonded more (I thought) on the drive home. Dropped her off and she gave Me a hug.(She actually kept wearing my boots another day because Her Shoes were in My vehicle)


We continued to text and she asked to hang out again on the day before she left and we did,got coffee and it was short because she had an appointment,a caveat to before we were hanging out that day I went down and got her a yoga scent cleansing bracelet and also wanted to gift her a grounding mat for sleep because I knew she was into energy reiki and yoga,and she also told Me she Was going to gift Me some Saffron (which I know is expensive,I am sure she is well off though not sure how) so I put it in a box for Her when I picked her up She gifted Me a large amount of supplements and things she would not be taking with Her, when I told Her I had a gift for Her she was taken aback and thanked Me,Because I was driving I didnt really explain how the bracelet was not expensive and It was related to Her interests etc,I also asked a girl friend If that would be ok to do and she said Yes,thats very thoughtful.


That night after we had hung out she sent Me a text asking If I could fix Her computer I said I could and went up to fix it,I got it working completely and we made small talk,she said she needed to lose wait,I told Her she did not and she looked good,also throughout she would always compliment Me on how I am very sweet and kind and smart,these seem to be the things she liked about Me,when She would put Herself down I would always tell Her we are all smart in our own way,and she seemed to agree.she also made a comment on Her clothes and I said the outfit she wore at dinner looked nice,she seemed taken aback by this and that I remembered.

Shes the type of girl who thinks out loud which I adore its really cute How I can pick out the things she says and then have a deeper convo with Her,I guess this is why this hurts like it does. Shell also mention that she was told She needs someone to care for Her(not financially just be there for her) I feel like when she calls Me sweet and nice and smart that she likes Me....and I liked that feeling having not had it in soo long.

Ok so that night I fixed the laptop and knew Her flight left Early I offered to drive Her to the airport because some of the cabbies in our town are perverts,and I wanted to make sure she got there. She agreed but said she could take a cab,but I insisted Id take Her.

I picked Her up the next am and took her to the airport,she told Me she may have lost a necklace at out property I asked if she had a description and I could enquire (I know the people that run it) she seemed to get suspicious as I didnt explain that and then we discussed that she should call and enquire,also when I picked her up I had red on My face from My gum (sometimes it comes off when I hold the gum in My hand) I am starting to panic think Maybe she thought it was lipstick, anyways I dropped Her off unloaded Her luggage and she asked for a hug. Then I left.

An hr later she texted Me saying she is taking off and thanked Me for the ride. I didnt see it right away because I had to sleep for work. When I did answer I explained these things and mentioned I missed your texts a bit,but text to speech made it say I kinda miss you a bit. Then I asked Her to text Me once she landed (2 flights) so I knew she was Home safe (she did not) the next am(yesterday) she sent Me an fb link but it didnt work so I left a question mark (was half awake) she made some comments about greece and told Me to get some sleep before work(I told her I had slept all night to which she repled ""good"" I told Im glad she made it home and that I was worried abit after that she texted Me on more time about the weather,I replied and she has not replied since, last text i sent was at 11pm asking how Her day was and she didnt reply.


Background on Me: Im a bigger guy not great looking not ugly definately have potential,but I do find Myself lacking confidence sometimes, had a terrible relationship years back and it put Me off of dating,this was the first time ever a women initiated so it felt really good(and confusing). Im kind Im thoughtful and I care about people(so Ive been told)


I know She likes space and I dont want to bother Her Im pretty sure I scared Her off by being too nice but the way she was complimenting Me I thought she liked it, maybe the bracelet was too much,Maybe it was something I said,I just dont know,either way shes a great women and I want Her to be Happy from what she tells Me she seems to Have alot on Her plate and I dont want to force Her to talk to Me,but since she left it seems like such a 180 going from always talking to being ghosted.",1,1738841137.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Okay so August 2023 (I weighed 70kg) I made a pasta dish that had heaps of cherry tomatoes and cream, it was nice and I ate almost a punnet of cherry tomatoes. Next day I coughed up bright red blood and went to the GP who said it might be acid reflux and the acid stayed in my esophagus overnight hence the blood. I was prescribed omeprazole but GP said it was optional as it was a once off and told me just to watch my diet. 

March 2024 (70kg again) i had some dull pain on my left middle abdomen. Idk what made GP said it was gastritis but she prescribed omeprazole 20mg for 2 months. I took it for a month.


September 2024 I had a really bad flare up. Burning in my chest, no pain though, but the sensation didn‚Äôt go away until a couple of weeks. Took omeprazole 40mg for a month. Then gp extended 40mg for another 4 weeks (October) 20mg for 4 more weeks (November)

Dec-Jan - ok. No symptoms

Last saturday Feb 1 - flare up again. I think the culprit was the instant coffee I drank on friday. Back pain 5-6/10, same dull pain on my left middle abdomen, pain on my arm. Went to Emergency and they said GERD.
I‚Äôm now on omeprazole for 2 weeks.

My question is do you have to make permanent dietary changes for Gerd? Cause for me once the symptoms were gone I went back to my normal diet. I have eaten a lot healthily now since November 2024, I was 72kg in November 20 2024 and now 64.5kg. ",1,1738840833.0,GERD,4,1.0,False

We texted almost everyday initially and some of our text included personal questions like how many exes we had. In essence, I am positive he was physically attracted to me but we did not raised the topic of us dating as workplace romance is something to be dealt with carefully. But we did agree on being subtle about flirting (if any) as we want to keep things professional. However, lately, he has been very close to another female colleague of mine, and I suspect the other girl is interested in him as well. Called it female‚Äôs intuition because she is very giggly around him and approached him for conversation on several occasions that people from my department started teasing about them dating. It also doesn‚Äôt help that he‚Äôs quite gentlemen, so he will definitely not reject the girl‚Äôs advances or approaches. So he accompanied the girl for coffee breaks a few times and he is also responsive to her jokes and humor. That got me upset because while we agreed on being discreet about flirting (if we do), he was openly flirting/ having a good time with another girl colleague. So I showed him cold shoulders and look of annoyance a few times, and I believe he is aware that I‚Äôm annoyed by the 2 of them. However, he ignores my question when I asked if they are close. Lately, he has left my message on read for 3-4 days, and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because he knows im angry at him, or he‚Äôs starting to date the other girl colleague. In a way, I do feel that my jealousy and anger has kinda pushed us further from each other but I don‚Äôt want to invalidates my feelings. He was the one who started hitting on me initially (low key). He could have also gave me reassurance on text privately by being concerned on why I am angry ( I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs that dense) or even texted more consistently as of late if he was seriously interested. I‚Äôm disappointed and felt like he was just playing with me initially.  They say people usually show their best performance early on and if he‚Äôs already showing such red flags early on, I will drop him indefinitely and cut interactions as much as possible from now on.


TLDR: a guy colleague who I was flirting with subtly has recently been very close to another girl colleague.

---------------------------------------------------------

Maximalism in home decor, especially in the kitchen, is all about embracing bold patterns, vibrant colors, and a variety of textures. Unlike minimalism, which promotes a ‚Äòless is more‚Äô philosophy, maximalist home decor allows you to go wild with your creativity. If you love eclectic styles that challenge conventional design, then maximalist decor in the kitchen might be your perfect match.

To get started, consider the color palette. Choose bright and lively colors that ignite energy. Don't shy away from mixing hues like deep blues with sunny yellows or rich reds with emerald greens. When it comes to accents, think beyond the basics. You can use playful shades on cabinets or walls that truly reflect your personality. Paint one wall a daring color to create a striking focal point or opt for multi-colored cabinetry for a truly immersive look.

Next, let‚Äôs talk about patterns. Maximalism thrives on visual excitement. patterned tiles, wallpaper, or even dishware can enhance your kitchen's character. Here are some ideas:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/maximalist-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Tiles:** Choose vibrant patterned tiles for your backsplash or flooring. Look for designs with intricate motifs that captivate the eye.
- **Wallpaper:** A bold floral or geometric pattern can transform your kitchen instantly. Consider placing it on an accent wall for a stunning effect.
- **Dishes and Pots:** Display colorful plates and pots on open shelves. Mixing various designs can create an artful display.

Maximalism is all about curating a collection. Instead of hiding your kitchen gadgets, ornaments, and utensils, showcase them with pride. Hang your favorite pots and pans on a wall. Use open shelving to exhibit your colorful mixing bowls and fun coffee mugs. You might even want to create a gallery wall with framed artwork, photos, or quotes that reflect your taste and personality. This not only adds visual layers but invites conversation in your space.

Textiles play an essential role in maximalist decor. Look for tablecloths, curtains, and cushions that feature bold designs and rich textures. A vibrant table runner can set a lively tone for your dining area, while patterned curtains can add depth and warmth. Mixing and matching prints is encouraged in the world of maximalism. Just remember to keep a cohesive color scheme to tie everything together.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/maximalist-home-decor-kitchen  
  
Lighting is a crucial component of a maximalist kitchen. Consider unusual or large-scale fixtures that draw attention. A dramatic chandelier or an oversized pendant light can act as a centerpiece, enhancing the overall decor. Think about using warm, inviting bulbs to set a cozy atmosphere, and don‚Äôt hesitate to hang multiple light sources at different heights for added depth.

When choosing your furniture, go for pieces that encourage conversation and creativity. Bold-colored bar stools or a quirky dining table can become standout features. Choose materials and styles that offer contrast; for example, pair modern metal chairs with a rustic wooden table. The goal is to create a playful and welcoming environment that invites family and friends to gather.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/maximalist-home-decor-kitchen  
  
Don‚Äôt forget about the plants! greenery adds life and freshness to your maximalist kitchen. Choose bold planters that match or contrast your color scheme. Hang plants, place them on windowsills, or use them as centerpieces on your dining table. Fresh herbs like basil or mint can not only look good but also be practical for cooking.

One of the best things about embracing maximalist home decor in your kitchen is that it reflects who you are. Don't be afraid to experiment. Your kitchen should be a space that makes you feel excited and inspired. Mix and match ideas, colors, and textures to see what resonates with you. Allow yourself to take risks and, above all, have fun. After all, your home is a canvas, and the kitchen should be one of the most vibrant areas to express your personality!

Maximizing your kitchen decor involves a bold approach to colors, patterns, furniture, and accessories. This style not only makes your cooking space more functional but also transforms it into a lively heart of the home.

- Mix patterns through tiles, curtains, or table linens for added depth.

Remember to avoid overwhelming the space. A unified color scheme can help maintain a cohesive look while allowing each color to pop.

### Layer Textures

Texture plays a vital role in maximalist decor. Mixing different materials adds richness to your kitchen design. Try these ideas:

- Integrate wood, metal, and glass elements.
- Use textiles like rugs, cushions, and curtains for softness.
- Add ceramic or marble accents to create contrast.

Layering textures not only beautifies the space but can also visually section areas in your kitchen, making it feel welcoming and inviting.

### Incorporate Art and Personal Items

Your kitchen can be a mini-gallery filled with art and personal memorabilia. Consider these tips:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/maximalist-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- Hang quirky framed pictures or colorful artwork on the walls.
- Display your favorite cookbooks on open shelves for both functionality and decoration.
- Choose decorative items like a unique clock or artistic utensils that reflect your style.

Make sure to arrange items in an interesting way. Grouping them in odd numbers or varying heights can create a visually appealing display.

### Maximize Storage Solutions

In a maximalist kitchen, having ample storage is essential for keeping your space organized. Here are some ideas:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/maximalist-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- Utilize open shelving to showcase beautiful dishes and jars.
- Invest in multi-functional furniture, like an island with built-in storage.
- Use decorative baskets and boxes to store items stylishly.

A well-organized space will prevent clutter, allowing your vibrant decor to shine without feeling chaotic.

### Choose Unique Hardware and Fixtures

The small details can significantly impact the overall aesthetic. Consider the following:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/maximalist-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- Select bold cabinet knobs and handles that stand out.
- Opt for an eye-catching faucet or sink that serves as a focal point.
- Look for unique lighting fixtures, like chandeliers or colorful pendants, to enhance your kitchen‚Äôs character.

These unique touches connect functionality and aesthetics while ensuring that every element in the kitchen serves a purpose.

### Mix Vintage and Modern Elements

Combining different styles can create a unique maximalist vibe. Be sure to mix:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/maximalist-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- Old and new kitchen appliances for a curated look.
- Vintage-inspired furniture with contemporary designs.
- Classic patterns with modern prints.

This blending of styles keeps the kitchen fresh and engaging, while also providing you with the functionality that modern appliances offer.

### Stay Practical with Layouts

Functionality starts with a good layout. When designing your maximalist kitchen, consider:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/maximalist-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- Keeping the work triangle in mind: the distance between the stove, sink, and refrigerator should be optimized for ease of movement.
- Creating separate zones for cooking, cleaning, and socializing.
- Ensuring enough counter space is available for food preparation and serving.

A practical layout allows you to enjoy your space fully while still displaying your maximalist style.

Remember, achieving a maximalist kitchen is about expressing yourself while keeping it functional. By blending colors, textures, personal items, and practical storage solutions, your kitchen can become both a work of art and a place where cooking is a joy. Your kitchen should feel vibrant and alive, making it a heartwarming gathering area for family and friends.

### Conclusion

Maximalist home decor in your kitchen is all about embracing bold colors, unique patterns, and a mix of different styles that come together to create a vibrant and inviting space. By incorporating daring choices like eclectic dishware, patterned textiles, and artwork, you can turn your kitchen into a reflection of your personality. No longer a place reserved solely for cooking, your kitchen can be a canvas for creativity, celebrating the beauty of abundance and variety.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/maximalist-home-decor-kitchen  
  
However, it's essential to strike the right balance between aesthetics and functionality. A practical approach ensures your maximalist kitchen remains user-friendly. Start by prioritizing storage solutions that blend seamlessly into your bold decor. Use open shelving to display your most colorful kitchen items, while hidden storage maintains an organized atmosphere. Consider the flow of your workspace, ensuring that vibrant decor does not hinder your daily cooking routines. Specific zones for cooking, prep, and entertaining can enhance usability and keep clutter at bay.

Ultimately, a maximalist kitchen is not just about filling a space with items but curating a joyful environment that feels alive and lived-in. By thoughtfully blending both style and function, you can create a space where inspiration thrives. Every detail, from the smallest dish to the grandest display, contributes to a kitchen that‚Äôs as practical as it is visually striking. Let your imagination soar, and don‚Äôt shy away from mixing and matching to find what truly resonates with you. Embrace the maximalist mindset and transform your kitchen into a hub of creativity and warmth!

Finally , every character in this show lacks boundaries. I could never in my life hang out with people like this, except Harry. Harry has more boundaries and maturity then every other character, and he's supposed to be an Alien!

1iizwtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_johnsmithmath89/comments/1iizwtv/is_coffee_healthy_discover_the_sciencebacked/,Is Coffee Healthy? Discover the Science-Backed Benefits of Your Daily Brew,"Coffee is more than just a morning ritual or an energy booster‚Äîit‚Äôs a beverage packed with health benefits, backed by scientific research. Over the years, coffee has transitioned from being viewed as a guilty pleasure to being recognized as a potential superdrink. So, is coffee healthy? Let‚Äôs dive into the science and explore the numerous benefits your daily brew can offer.

# 1. Rich in Antioxidants

Coffee is one of the largest sources of antioxidants in the average diet. Antioxidants help fight free radicals, reducing oxidative stress and lowering the risk of chronic diseases. In fact, studies have shown that coffee contains more antioxidants than fruits and vegetables combined. These compounds, such as chlorogenic acid and polyphenols, play a key role in protecting your cells from damage.

# 2. Boosts Physical Performance

The caffeine in coffee is a natural stimulant that increases adrenaline levels in your bloodstream. This hormone prepares your body for intense physical exertion, improving endurance and performance. Research suggests that drinking coffee before a workout can enhance physical performance by up to 12%. This makes it a favorite among athletes and fitness enthusiasts.

# 3. Enhances Mental Alertness and Focus

One of the most well-known benefits of coffee is its ability to improve mental alertness and concentration. Caffeine blocks adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep, leading to increased firing of neurons and the release of dopamine and norepinephrine. This enhances mood, reaction time, memory, and cognitive function.

# 4. May Lower the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes

Several studies have linked regular coffee consumption to a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Coffee helps regulate blood sugar levels and improves insulin sensitivity. Both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee seem to offer this benefit, indicating that compounds other than caffeine are responsible for this protective effect.

# 5. Supports Heart Health

While coffee was once believed to contribute to heart problems, recent research has debunked this myth. Moderate coffee consumption (3-5 cups per day) is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke. The antioxidants in coffee may help reduce inflammation and improve blood vessel function, contributing to better cardiovascular health.

# 6. Protects Against Neurodegenerative Diseases

Drinking coffee regularly has been linked to a lower risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs. Caffeine helps maintain the health of brain cells and prevents the buildup of harmful proteins associated with these conditions. Studies suggest that coffee drinkers have up to a 65% lower risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.

# 7. Aids in Weight Management

Coffee can support weight loss and management by boosting metabolism and promoting fat burning. Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, increasing the metabolic rate by 3-11%. Additionally, it can enhance fat oxidation, making it easier to shed those extra pounds, especially when combined with regular exercise.

# 8. May Reduce the Risk of Certain Cancers

Some research indicates that coffee consumption may lower the risk of certain types of cancer, including liver, colorectal, and endometrial cancer. The antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds in coffee help protect cells from damage and inhibit the growth of cancerous cells.

# 9. Promotes Liver Health

Your liver loves coffee! Regular consumption has been linked to a lower risk of liver diseases, including fatty liver disease, hepatitis, and even liver cancer. Coffee drinkers have up to an 84% lower risk of developing liver cirrhosis, especially alcoholic cirrhosis.

# 10. Improves Mood and Fights Depression

Coffee can act as a natural antidepressant. The caffeine boosts the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which improve mood and decrease the risk of depression. Studies have shown that people who drink coffee are less likely to suffer from depression and are at a lower risk of suicide.

# 11. Extends Longevity

Here‚Äôs some good news for coffee lovers: drinking coffee may help you live longer. Studies have found that regular coffee consumption is linked to a lower risk of death from all causes, including heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. The combination of antioxidants, anti-inflammatory properties, and metabolic benefits contribute to this longevity effect.

# 12. Provides Essential Nutrients

Coffee isn‚Äôt just about caffeine; it also contains essential nutrients like B vitamins (B2, B3, B5), manganese, potassium, and magnesium. These nutrients play vital roles in energy production, muscle function, and overall health.

# How Much Coffee is Healthy?

While coffee offers numerous health benefits, moderation is key. The ideal amount varies from person to person, but most studies suggest that 3-5 cups of coffee per day can provide the maximum health benefits without adverse effects. Too much caffeine can lead to insomnia, jitteriness, increased heart rate, and digestive issues.

# Potential Downsides of Coffee

Despite its benefits, coffee isn't for everyone. Some people may be sensitive to caffeine and experience anxiety, restlessness, or sleep disturbances. It can also lead to acid reflux in some individuals due to its acidity. Pregnant women and individuals with certain health conditions should consult their doctors about coffee consumption.

# Decaf Coffee: Is It Still Healthy?

If you‚Äôre sensitive to caffeine but still love the taste of coffee, decaf is a great option. While decaf coffee contains less caffeine, it still offers many of the same health benefits due to its antioxidant content. It‚Äôs an excellent choice for those looking to reduce their caffeine intake without sacrificing flavor or health perks.

# Final Thoughts: Should You Keep Drinking Coffee?

So, is coffee healthy? Absolutely! When consumed in moderation, coffee offers a wealth of science-backed health benefits, from boosting mental and physical performance to protecting against chronic diseases. Whether you‚Äôre sipping it to start your day or enjoying it as a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, your daily brew can be a powerful ally in your health journey.

However, like anything, balance is crucial. Pay attention to how your body responds to caffeine, choose quality coffee, and avoid overloading it with sugar and unhealthy creamers. By doing so, you can enjoy all the benefits coffee has to offer while minimizing potential downsides.

I can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a community for this - then again, I was looking for it so clearly it‚Äôs a universal question we ask! :)

I (24F) was talking to a guy, J (24M) online, however, it was super casual. We‚Äôve met once for 30 minutes for a coffee, and he asked for another ‚Äúmeet‚Äù for tea after work today. 

Context for me: I was previously dating someone of a different nationality, told my parents, they became extra controlling and now monitor every move of mine. So meeting J was risky, an after work thing, in a very small window.

Context for him: Well he was working from home, and said that he‚Äôd meet me at a spot 20 mins from my work (more cause peak hour traffic) because that‚Äôs where he‚Äôll go to gym after work. 

Anyways, I had to rush a patient out the door 10 minutes sooner so I could make it in time. I said 6:20, and I was there by 6:12 PM. We decided for him to be there by 6:10 so he could place an order and so we could spend more time talking. He messaged me at 6:11 saying that he‚Äôll be leaving soon, and that it‚Äôll take him another 15 minutes.

I had to be home by 7 so my parents didn‚Äôt become suspicious, so I said I was heading back home. To which he replied, ‚ÄúRip‚Äù and ‚ÄúYour window was so tight, how do you ever get anything done‚Äù‚Ä¶instead of a simple sorry‚Ä¶

Maybe it was OpenAI investors, who were bored of the same thing and unimpressed with Operator, their browser-based AI framework. Maybe he just had a bad dream.

[Link to I am among the first people to gain access to OpenAI‚Äôs ‚ÄúOperator‚Äù Agent. here are my thoughts.](https://ai.plainenglish.io/i-am-among-the-first-people-to-gain-access-to-openais-operator-agent-here-are-my-thoughts-65a5116e5eaa)

But something within Sam‚Äôs soul changed. And AI enthusiasts are extremely lucky for it.

Because OpenAI just quietly released *Deep Research*\*\*. This thing is really fucking cool.\*\*

# What is Deep Research?

Deep Research is the first successful real-world application of ‚ÄúAI agents‚Äù that I have ever seen. You give it a complex, time-consuming task, and it will do the research fully autonomously, backed by citations.

This is **extremely useful** for individuals and businesses.

For the first time ever, I can ask AI to do a complex task, walk away from my computer, and come back with a detailed report containing exactly what I need.

Here‚Äôs an example.

**A Real-World Research Task**

When OpenAI‚Äôs Operator, a browser-based agentic framework, was released, I gave it the following task.

[Pic: Asking Operator to find financial influencers](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*BEegN-Jv70paZhRF.png)

>Gather a list of 50 popular financial influencers from YouTube. Get their LinkedIn information (if possible), their emails, and a short summary of what their channel is about. Format the answers in a table

It did a horrible job.

[Pic: The spreadsheet created by Operator](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*ENkoQE80Zx5YsfXX.png)

* It hallucinated, giving LinkedIn profiles and emails that simply didn‚Äôt exist
* It was painstakingly slow
* It didn‚Äôt have a great strategy

Because of this, I didn‚Äôt have high hopes for Deep Research. Unlike Operator, it‚Äôs fully autonomous and asynchronous. It doesn‚Äôt open a browser and go to websites; it simply searches the web by crawling. This makes it much faster.

And apparently much more accurate. I gave Deep Research an even more challenging task.

[Pic: Asking Deep Research to find influencers for me](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Pw6ttvvQRbQeSZOWP7JVNQ.png)

Instead of looking at YouTube, I told it to look through LinkedIn, YouTube, and Instagram.

It then asked me a few follow-up questions, including if it should prioritize certain platforms or if I wanted a certain number of followers. I was taken aback. And kinda impressed.

I then gave it my response, and then‚Ä¶ nothing.

[Pic: My response to the AI](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Q4QwqKEqJw8cVCxrXFUJHQ.png)

It told me that it would ‚Äúlet me know‚Äù when it‚Äôs ready. As someone who‚Äôs been using AI since before GPT-3, I wasn‚Äôt used to this.

I made myself a cup of coffee and came back to an insane spreadsheet.

[Pic: The response from Deep Research after 10 minutes](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*9gNHi_JbEhGs5mO1ZFBGPw.png)

The AI gathered a list of 100 influencers, with direct links to their profile. Just from clicking a few links, I could tell that it was not hallucinating; it was 100% real.

I was shocked.

This nifty tool costing me $200/month might have just transformed how I can do lead generation. As a small business trying to partner with other people, doing the manual work of scoping profiles, reading through them, and coming up with a customized message sounded exhausting.

I didn‚Äôt want to do it.

And I now don‚Äôt have to‚Ä¶

This is insane.

# Concluding Thoughts

Just from the 15 minutes I‚Äôve played with this tool, I know for a fact that OpenAI stepped up their game. Their vision of making agentic tools commonplace no longer seems like a fairytale. While I still have strong doubts that agents will be as ubiquitous as they believe, this feature has been a godsend when it comes to lead generation.

Overall, I‚Äôm extremely excited. It‚Äôs not every day that AI enthusiasts see novel AI tools released by the biggest AI giant of them all. I‚Äôm excited to see what people use it for, and how the open-source giants like Meta and DeepSeek transform this into one of their own.

If you think the AI hype is dying down, OpenAI just proved you wrong.

1iizmx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/1iizmx8/is_this_a_bad_partner_or_cultural_difference/,Is this a bad partner or cultural difference?,"TL;DR: I recently ended a relationship and felt it was one-sided, with me doing most of the work and paying for everything. While I tried to support my partner financially and emotionally, she rarely contributed. Friends suggest it might be due to cultural differences, but I'm seeking feedback on whether this dynamic was inherently problematic or just a mismatch. Any insights would be appreciated!

Background:
Both of us: Well-financed, working in tech.
Her: Single mother of three, several past marriages.
Me: Single professional, never married, no kids.

Financially:
I covered all our outings, coffee, drinks, dinners, etc., while she never contributed financially. Despite understanding the dynamic of a man being a provider, it felt one-sided as she didn't reciprocate in other ways. She declined to help with chores like laundry and only made the bed occasionally. On the other hand, she spent lavishly on herself.

Romantic Gestures:
While I frequently showed romantic gestures like flowers, date nights, and special gifts, she only gave me a card once. She mentioned that these were just ‚Äúdoing something for someone‚Äù and not love languages, which I found offensive. Her idea of contributing was making me feel ""seen and heard.""

Planning and Support:
I planned most dates and hosted our gatherings. She once took me to a park where my car got towed, which I resolved myself. I supported and encouraged her during difficult times, but she didn‚Äôt reciprocate emotionally when I was upset.

Intimacy:
I am affectionate, whereas she wasn't, even with her children. Although our physical relationship was good, she disclosed her STD only after we were intimate, which was concerning.

Question:
Does this sound like a one-sided dynamic, or am I not understanding a proper provider role or potential cultural differences? Relationships should be mutually beneficial to some degree. Some friends blame me, while others don‚Äôt. I would appreciate any feedback.

The relationship ended abruptly when my card declined at dinner, and she left without speaking to me again. We were supposed to discuss my unhappiness, but the situation escalated. I texted her, asking for an apology, but received no reply.

It involves travelling to and from locations in a company vehicle. 

Recently I was on his MacBook, with permission, and messages from his coworker Lucy (similar age?) popped up. I found out that this coworker has given him a lift home several times despite him telling me they are not allowed to in company cars (the mileage is recorded). 

This woman had messaged him over the last 2/3 months asking where he is or telling him where to meet- I‚Äôm assuming this is work related. She also wished a merry Christmas to him and his dog and family. He said it back. At this time her number wasn‚Äôt saved on his phone so at the time he told me he didn‚Äôt know who the number was. 

After he saved her number, he had deleted all of these messages from his phone. The other Sunday she messaged him ‚Äúare you free for a call‚Äù. He said this was about the location of a meeting they had the next day.  

Obviously I was annoyed when I found out he had hidden and deleted this, but we are due to sign a tenancy for a new house in 2 days so I put it in the back of my mind. 

Earlier today, I was using his MacBook again and messages came through. Last night she  messaged him at 10pm saying:

1iizixd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SophiaWisdomOfGod/comments/1iizixd/the_life_of_st_xenia_of_petersburg_january/,The Life of St. Xenia of Petersburg. January 24/February 6,"https://preview.redd.it/6xyrecs3xhhe1.png?width=260&format=png&auto=webp&s=28b17c238bedcbbada9d43352dba3755fedcb06d

St. Xenia was the wife of Colonel Andrei Feodorovich Petrov, who served as a court chanter. At the age of 26, Xenia was widowed and, appeared to have lost her mind from grief: she distributed her possessions to the poor, dressed herself in the clothes of her reposed husband, and, as if having forgotten her own name, called herself by the name of her proposed husband - Andrei Feodorovich.

These eccentricities were not indicative of a loss of reason, however, but signified a complete disdain for earthly goods and human opinion, which places them at the center of existence. Thus, Xenia of Petersburg took upon herself the difficult podvig of foolishness for Christ's sake.

Having come to know the inconstancy of earthly happiness through the death of her beloved husband, Xenia strove toward God with all her heart, and sought protection and comfort only in Him. Earthly, transitory goods ceased to have any value for her. Xenia had a house; but gave it over to an acquaintance under the condition that it be used to shelter paupers. But Xenia herself, not having a refuge, would wander among the paupers of Petersburg. At night she would go out to a field, where she spent the time in ardent prayer.

When they began to build a church in the Smolensk Cemetery, Xenia, after the onset of darkness, would secretly carry bricks to the top of the construction, and thereby helped the masons erect the walls of the church.

Some of Xenia's relatives wanted to take her in and provide her with all necessities, but the blessed one replied to them: ""I do not need anything.""

She was glad of her poverty, and when visiting somewhere, would at times remark: ""I am all here!"" When her reposed husband's clothing wore out, Xenia clothed herself in the poorest clothing, and wore torn shoes without stockings on her feet. She did not dress warmly and forced her body to suffer from the severe cold.

Sensing the greatness of Blessed Xenia's soul, the inhabitants of Petersburg loved her, because she despised the earthly for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. If Xenia entered anyone's home, this was considered a good sign. Mothers rejoiced if she kissed their children. Cab drivers would ask permission of the blessed one to drive her a little, since after this the earnings would be guaranteed for the whole day. Merchants in the bazaars would try to give here kalach \[cracknel bread\] or some food; if Blessed Xenia took something from what was offered, all the wares of the seller were quickly bought up.

Xenia had the gift of clairvoyance. On the eve of the Nativity of Christ in 1762, she walked about Petersburg and said, ""Bake blini! Tomorrow all Russia will bake blini!"" The next day, the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna, suddenly died \[blini is traditionally made at someone's death\]. A few days before the murder of the royal youth, John VI (Antonovich, the greatgreatgrandson of Tsar Alexis Michailovich), who in infancy had been proclaimed the Russian Emperor, the blessed one wept and repeated, ""Blood, blood, blood."" Within a few days after Mirovich's unsuccessful conspiracy, the young John was killed.

Once, Xenia came to a home where there was a grown-up daughter. Turning to the girl, she said, ""Here you are drinking coffee, while your husband is burying his wife at Okhta."" After a certain time, this girl married that very widower who at that moment had been burying his first wife at the Okhta Cemetery.

Blessed Xenia died at the end of the eighteenth century, but tradition has not preserved either the year or day of her decease. She was buried in the Smolensk Cemetery, where she had helped build the church.

Pilgrimages to her grave began shortly after her decease. Blessed Xenia often appeared in visions to people in difficult circumstances, forewarned of dangers and saved them from calamities. The righteous one has not ceased to show compassionate love toward all who with faith have called upon her, and many instances of her help for the suffering and those in desperate situations are known.

A civil servant, Nicholas Selivanovich Golovin, had lived in Grodno approximately until 1907. He often experienced unpleasantness at work. He came to Petersburg to put his affairs in order, but they became even more entangled. Golovin was very poor, caring for his elderly mother and two sisters. In despair, he walked along the streets of Petersburg, and, though he was a man of faith, the thought to throw himself into the Neva stole into his soul. At this moment, some unknown woman stood in front of him. He was struck by her appearance, which was reminiscent of a poor nun. ""Why are you so sad?"" she asked. ""Go to the Smolensk Cemetery, serve a panikhida \[a requiem service\] for Xenia, and everything will be settled."" After these words, the unknown woman disappeared. Golovin fulfilled the advice of the mysterious nun, and his affairs were unexpectedly settled in the best manner possible. He joyfully returned home to Grodno.

Emperor Alexander III, when he was the heir, became ill with a serious form of typhus. The Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna was very alarmed by her spouse's illness. One of the valets, seeing her in the corridor, related to her how Blessed Xenia helps the sick, gave her sand from the cherished grave and added that he himself had been healed from illness by the prayer of the righteous one. The Grand Duchess placed the sand under the pillow of the patient. That same night, while sitting at the head of the bed, she had a vision of Blessed Xenia, who told her that the patient would recover and that a daughter would be born in their family. She should be called Xenia. The prediction of the blessed one was fulfilled exactly.

In the Pskov province, a relative from Petersburg came to stay for a while with a landowner and counted how they revere Blessed Xenia in the capital. Under the influence of this account, the pious landowner prayed before sleep for the repose of her soul. At night, she dreamed that Xenia was walking around her house and pouring water on it. In the morning, the hay barn on the country estate caught on fire, but the fire did not spread further and the home remained whole.

A colonel's widow arrived in Petersburg to enroll her two sons into the Cadet Corps. She did not succeed in this. The money borrowed for the trip had come to an end, and the widow walked along the street and wept bitterly. Suddenly, some woman of the common people came up to her and said: ""Serve a panikhida for Xenia. She helps in sorrows."" ""Who is this Xenia?"" asked the colonel's widow. ""The tongue \[that asks the way\] will lead to Kiev,"" she answered, quickly vanishing.

Indeed, the colonel's widow easily learned who this Xenia was. She served a panikhida for her at her grave in the Smolensk Cemetery, and shortly after receiving the unexpected news that both her sons had been accepted into the Cadet Corps.

A multitude of similar instances of Blessed Xenia's help is also known in our days.

**TROPARION, TONE 4**

Having renounced the vanity of the earthly world, / Thou didst take up the cross of a homeless life of wandering; / Thou didst not fear grief, privation, nor the mockery of men, / And didst know the love of Christ. / Now taking sweet delight of this love in heaven, / O Xenia, the blessed and divinely wise, // Pray for the salvation of our souls.

1iizi5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/1iizi5k/brown_butter_white_loaf/,Brown Butter White Loaf,"Everything started while talking to a friend who also dabbles with sourdough, and were talking about the brown butter we had at a restaurant we visited together. So, I told her ""why not a sourdough bread with brown butter in it?"". Here is the recipe and the execution,

Ingredients

* 540gr manitoba flour with 14% protein
* 380gr water (initial temp at 40C)
* 110gr starter
* 6gr freshly-ground pink salt
* 65gr brown butter

Execution

1. I started by browning around 100gr of butter in a pan. However, because it got burned a bit, I passed it through a coffee filter.
2. While that was cooling and getting filtered, I mixed the flour and the warm water in the stand mixer on low until no dry spots remained and let it sit for about 30 minutes (autolyse).
3. After the 30-min autolyse, I put on the dough hook and added the starter to the mix. Mixed for a couple of minutes on low (setting 2 out of 6) and then I added the salt. I, then, mixed again for a couple of minutes.
4. After around 3-4 minuted had passed, I started streaming the butter on the wall of the bowl. I did that 3 times because I was waiting for the mixture to absorb the butter.
5. When I added the last portion of the melted butter, I turned the mixer to 3/6 and mixed for another 4 minutes.
6. I then transferred to an oiled plastic contained to begin bulk fermentation.
7. For 1,5 hours, every 30 minutes I did 4 sets of stretch and folds. Then, I let it ferment in the oiled container covered for 6 hours at which point the dough had doubled.
8. After bulk fermentation, I took the dough out of the container, stretched it to a sheet, folded and shaped into a ball, then transferred into a bowl lined with a floured towel and left to rise for another 2 hours.
9. Finally, I baked into a Pyrex bowl covered for 40 minutes, then another 5 for colour. The oven temp was around 200 to 220C.

Some thoughts,

1. Must be more careful with browning the butter, as filtering it took most of the taste and the aromas out of it.
2. It rose significantly in the pyrex bowl, so I think of splitting the dough next time. I'm also thinking of a solid 75% hydration.
3. In my opinion, white flours can handle a bit more salt, so next time I'm thinking of increasing the salt to 2%, i.e. around 10-12gr.
4. Still improving my shaping and scoring techniques, as I think scoring could have helped the dough rise more uniformly.
5. Next time, I need to bake for 20-25 minutes at that oven temp with the lid on, and then another 20 at a lower temp without the lid and fans.

What are your thoughts and feedback?

   * Works well in modern, bohemian, and minimalist spaces
   * Pairs beautifully with plush sofas and textured rugs

At Home and Soul Dubai, we offer cloud coffee tables crafted from high-quality materials like marble, rattan, and metal ensuring durability while maintaining a luxurious look.

* **Why a Large Coffee Table Works Best:**
