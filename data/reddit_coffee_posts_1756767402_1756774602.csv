This may be long, I apologize in advance. I’ll try to keep it short. It was my ex, like 20 years ago ex we’ve had no contact in that time at all and tbh I assumed I was long forgotten in his world. Back story we were young, he was the love of my life in my young naive mind and I stupidly ended it thinking it would illicit the response I felt I needed at the time. Again young and stupid. He was only the second guy I had dated and I lost him after that and rightfully so. Fast forward 20 years and there he was reaching out to reconnect. I’m single and have been by choice for a couple years now, he had been married and was separated his marriage was long over, or so I was told. After our initial “catch up” chat, it was only a few days before he asked if I wanted to go out for a drink or coffee sometime and chat more about the past 20 years. We did and the connection was instant, like no time had passed. Our lives it turned out had so many crazy coincidences that made it feel fated. We had unknowingly both moved to another near by city, kids in the same schools, both had our first child within a month of the other and were basically neighbours for years with two blocks between us. It was insane. We reminisced over the past and it was honestly really validating to know how much I actually meant to him back then. Things were progressing and there was a sense of comfort since we had been together before. It was fun, we were acting like a couple of kids again who couldn’t get enough of each other, he was far more open than I recall and made it very clear he wanted a future with me, bringing me to meet up with his friends that I had previously met and so on. All these things gave me more comfort and made my guard drop. We had kissed and had been intimate in other ways but it took a while for us to have actual sex (a few weeks). When that happened I had this feeling that I couldn’t shake. Then there was a definite shift in behaviour (I’m not that naive so I get all this very well was just for sex)but now I’m concerned the story I was told was just that, a story. We don’t have enough mutual friends for me to be able to confirm if he’s actually still married or not. I do know who he was/is married to, but neither of them have much of a social media presence for this to be obvious. I have this guilt and I can’t shake it. Like I was the other woman and I had no idea. If they are I don’t want to go reaching out to her to say hey I slept with your ex but if they’re not and she still thinks they’re happily married, she deserves to know. I know I would want to at least. I just need advice. Do I tell her or do I leave it? Any suggestions at all would be great. I really don’t need any lectures or anything but I just need an outside perspective to give me the clarity that I need. I want to do the right thing and I could care less about his reaction. I’ve been cheated on and wish they had told me so that’s where I’m leaning I’m just concerned that if they’re actually not together. Please help ",1,1756774406.0,TwoXChromosomes,0,1.0,False

**Memory Transcription Subject: Balo, Student of the Arts**  
*Date \[Standardized Human Time\] October 14th, 2136*

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I watched as the human--apparently named Claude--rushed out of the train. They (*he?*) had longer hair than the others I had seen. Though that was a small detail compared to the fact that I had an *intelligent conversation* with them about art. My father would be amazed at that… after being livid at me for being so close to them.

*I even asked to keep in touch!*

I must be predator-diseased now, if not before. The train doors shut seamlessly. I was still sitting on the train seat, heading towards the University. I would normally trace my way back through the city, but I had spent too long in the park. I ran my claws through my fur. The train moved to the next stop, but my mind was still.

*A predator-diseased artist? A human WITH predator disease?*

I scratched my fur with that thought. As we headed into the denser part of the city, the buildings started to blur together. I sat alone with my thoughts. I looked to where Claude had sat. They were reading something, I remember, on their pad. It scratched at my head.

*What is human art?*

I mean, I’ve had the taste of one particular fruit of labor from an old artist, who had predator disease, or the predator equivalent to it. The gentleness with which the artist viewed the world must be a consequence of it. It has to, or everything I learned was wrong. I started to pull out my pad, but the train started to pull into the University station. I put it and my thoughts away for the time being.

My next class was Studio. It wasn’t the best of workspaces. I mean, the arts are particularly high on the funding list, and besides, we’re going to a community college. It was dimly lit, and the room was cluttered with expensive art supplies--the most expensive of which was locked in a closet, and only used by the seniors.

We had a claw to work with, and we started with a quick warmup with a model, who was there for a quarter-claw. The professor was having us focus on value (the difference between light and dark), proportion, and shape. The entire class worked in silence, the model stood stiff, and we viewed them. I set up my canvas on the easel and got to work with the clumpy paint. I started with a layer of beigeish-tan. The studio faded, and the sharp clatter of palettes and brushes into tins of paint thinners mellowed out into dull thuds, which then stopped being registered by my ears. The talking of the professor and the curses from my neighbor dulled into a light babble. The fan creaked above us, too slow to provide any sort of cooling in the stuffy studio.

The model had white fur, fluffed and styled. Their face was emotionless, focused, probably, on keeping still and constant. My mind drifted to Claude, and that art piece that I saw.  The striking brush strokes, the colors that expressed what it was, rather than relate exactly what is. That artist, Vincent van Gogh, had an eye for color, an eye for the underlying reality beneath the facade of the real. Perhaps I could do something like that.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Claude Schmidt, Aspiring Artist**  
*Date \[Standardized Human Time\] October 14th, 2136*

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I approached the stale looking building, double checking the address I had gotten. The part of town we were put in was not the best looking. The clean white buildings had shrunk, and the streets got more cluttered. A metaphor for the locals' dislike of us, I guess. They think we’re dirty, so we belong in dirty.

The receptionist shifted his eyes just above the computer to see me, before looking back to the screen. He was muttering under his breath. I briskly walked towards the desk, taking off my mask as I approached. In front of the computer, he had a nameplate, written on with what looked to be a Sharpie, saying his name was “George Wright.”

“I don’t recognize you,” he said. He had a soft British accent. Not a posh one, but more of a down-and-out guy from the East End. “What’s your name?”

“Claude Schmidt,” I stated, “I was told that this is where I was staying.”

He shifted his eyes from the primary computer monitor to a smaller secondary one. I shifted my head to see what was on it. It was a database of the apartment complex. He typed my name in, and leaned back. 

“Hold on,” he said, “This takes a while.”

I nodded and shuffled back. I took stock of the lobby while the computer did its thing. It was a drab, off-white box. The ceiling felt too short. Paint was flaking off the wall where it met the trim. There were a few paintings on the walls, mainly landscapes. One was a portrait, situated behind the receptionist's desk. It was one of the sheep folk, and below it was a plaque in their language. The translator spat out, “Kadev, Prestige Exterminator.” It was a rather old portrait. I don’t know the sheep's body language, but they were stern-looking, their mouth a grimace. They had short wool.

The man at the reception laid back and pulled a cigarette from one of his pockets and began to smoke it. He was a tad short, balding, with thick square-rimmed glasses. He had a walrus mustache that covered the entirety of his upper lip, though it was shaven at each end neatly.

“Why’re you late?” he asked.

“Train troubles,” I stated simply.

“Ah, happens to the best of us,” he shrugged, “I remember taking the train for my mum’s funeral up in York. I was living in London at the time. So I go to the station, ‘cause I’ll be fucked if I’m driving 4 hours there, and another 4 back.” He took a drag of his cigarette. “I was going to take the LNER ‘cause it was cheaper than what others wanted. But when I got there, a massive rail strike had shut down the trains.”

“That’s gotta suck.”

“It did suck.”

“Did the workers get what they wanted?”

“No, most of them got replaced by scabs or fired.” He flicked the cigarette ash onto a plate, a saucer, not an ashtray. The ash pile was overflowing the indentation in the middle of it. “The lines were always looking to cut costs. The workers were biting the hand that fed them.”

“Were they paid well before the strike?”

“God no, barely enough to cover rent in London.”

The computer dinged, and the man sat up straight. He looked at the monitor, mouthing along with the words it said, and turned to me. “Alright, Mr. Schmidt, we do have you in our system. We got you in room 21, looked for the poorly painted signs on the front of the doors.” He opened one of the desk drawers. “Let me get you your key.”

It took a few minutes of grabbing a key, reading it, and dropping it back in for him to find the right one. “Alright, here it is.” He handed it to me.

“Thanks, man,” I said. I started down one hallway.

“Hold on,” He said, “Not that one, mate, the other one.” He pointed across the lobby.

I gave him a nod and went on my way.

I left the lobby, waving goodbye to George. The hallway was cramped. The walls felt a bit too close to me. The paint was an off-white color, though that might just be the lighting. It was dim, too. The lights were a musty, dirty yellow. It felt like home, honestly. I ran my finger down the wall, feeling the bumps and dips of the paint. When I pulled it back, it was covered in dust.

The hallway was symmetrical, a door matching another on the other wall. The lights were centered in the middle. No pictures lined these halls. The building was sturdy, I’ll give it that. One of the doors--number 15--opened a bit in front of me. It was a shorter man with a thick beard, and he came down the hall. I shuffled to one wall, and he to the other, and we slid past each other, with nothing more than a nod and a quiet “Excuse me” from me, and a “Pardon” from him.

I shuffled back to the middle, dusting off my arm. Another door--number 18 now--opened, and a familiar shape came out. It was Arthur, from the evac ship. He was still dressed in that white tee and jeans. He looked brighter than when we met, his hair seemed to have been tamed since. He looked at me, his eyes widening a bit.

“Well, looky here,” he said, his voice echoing off the walls, “If it ain’t the resident artist.” He had a broad smile.

A door opened a bit down, and the head of a young lady popped around the corner, “Can you quiet down a bit? Some people are trying to figure out their lives here.”

“Sorry, Syd,” Arthur apologized, his voice lower a few decibels, “Anyways, Claude! Good to see you again. I thought you’d been assigned to a different building.”

“Nope, just late is all,” I replied.

“Better late than early, I’d say, it was pandemonium when I got here.” He pointed down the hall. “Reception was swamped, doesn’t help that the computer they got seems like it was new when the Satellite War happened.”

“I had a whole ass conversation about a rail strike in England before it got done.” We chuckled.

“I would invite you inside, but it is a mess there.” He pointed to the open apartment door. “Like someone threw a flashbang in it.”

“Damn, it’s that bad?”

“Yea, I think the apartment owners just made the minimum effort to be considered by the UN.” He shrugged. “Can’t complain, it’s better than some places I’ve lived.”

We chuckled.

“Well, you’ve convinced me,” I said, “I’ve just got to move in.”

“Which room are you staying in?” Arthur asked.

“21, just down the hall here.” I pointed down, where I can barely just see my door. I shifted the weight of my bag, which had slipped down my shoulder during our chat, back up. “I should probably get some sleep anyway.”

“Yea, I should too,” he sighed, “It’s been a long day.”

We waved goodbye, he went into his apartment, and I did so too. The door was a plain board with only a knob, a bit low for me. I grabbed the key from my pocket and inserted it. It went in with a clink, and it turned, the lock protesting each degree. It was stuttery and stiff, and took a bit of effort to turn all the way. 

The lock finally clicked, and I was in. It was a small room, in the shape of an L. A small kitchen was to the left of the door, and the living room was right ahead. I headed in. It was bare. Not much to note. I set my bag on the counter and closed the door. It smelled musty, like my Grandma’s room in the nursing home. There was a small window on the far side of the room, opposite the door, and I opened it, letting the constant gentle breeze come in and liven things up a bit.

I took a look around. There is a small chair against the wall, with a coffee table in front of it, facing a television set. I grabbed the remote from the table and turned it on. A newscast from Capital News was the first channel. The headline at the bottom asks, “Humans, Empathetic Allies or Deceitful Predators?"" 

I rolled my eyes, but continued watching. It was a debate of some sort. There were three Venlil and a porcupine-looking creature (I looked it up during a lull in the debate, and found that they were called Gojids). I seemed to have caught the end of one of the questions.

“Finish your answer, Jarlo,” said the mediator, “Your time is up. Next is the local Chief Exterminator Remlek. What do you think of the claim that Humans are empathetic?”

Remlek was prepared to speak. He had a mean face, with short-cropped wool, like a buzz cut on a sheep. He had a booming voice, deeper than the other Venlils’ voices. “In my experience, predators are sneaky. They like to hide and wait for the opportunity to attack. The humans’ tactics are an extension of that. Faking empathy is the easiest way to lure prey. Simple as.” Some cheers came from the audience.

The Gojid spoke up, “While I am not experienced with predators in the same way that Remlek is, I must agree.” He shifted his weight as the spotlight came to him. “As a medical professional, I cannot envision that humans have empathy, it would not make sense for a predator to have it.”

“Now, Dr. Berlin (*Berlin? I thought*),” said Jarlo. He was short, even for the sheep folk. “We must be willing to open our minds to the fact that maybe we were wrong.”

“Hundreds of years of established science is wrong?” Berlin rhetorized, “We must simply throw out the rigor just because one of those creatures says that it does? That does not make good science, Aiva.”

“If I may add to this debate?” asked the Venlil that, up to this point, been silent.

“Yes, Professor Birlo?” said Remlek.

“I, as a professor of the arts, have an affinity for new art,” he began, “and I must say that humans, in the resources that they have given, have shown that they are more than capable of producing art.” He was quiet, soft-spoken.

“And how does that relate?” asked Berlin.

“I say that, because to produce art is one of the things that Remlek has said that differentiate prey from predators, and that predators are incapable of producing art. If I recall properly,” he fell silent, looking through his mind, “Remlek specifically said… ‘prey, as an act of empathy, connect with each other through art. Predators simply cannot relate to one another, and thus cannot make art.’ Is that correct, Remlek?”

“I do believe that I said something along those lines, yes,” replied Remlek, “I do not believe that the data dump that the humans’ UN is genuine, though.” He held himself in confidence. 

“I am not arguing one way or the other, I am arguing from the data I have,” Birlo cleared his throat. “I do not believe that humans are, or are not, empathetic, I am simply saying that from my point of view, that they have a capability to do the same as prey.”

“I have seen the things that they pass for art,” Remlek continued, “I am not impressed. I have sent to all of you, and the station, one of these horrid things. If you will now, open it. I will warn you, it is horrifying.” A [picture ](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/55/The_Beatles_-_Butcher_Cover.jpg)briefly flashed on the screen, before quickly being replaced by a censor \[PREDATORY VISUALS; visuals will return when graphic content is dropped.\]

The station returned, with each of the debaters slack-jawed. “Now,” Remlek continued as if nothing had happened, “My mate and I are enjoyers of art. We have ten or twelve pictures of art, all of which I like. But we don’t have any bit of meat stretched out on a table.” He took a pause for effect. “If we have sunk so low as to consider this art, I am sad to say that we have failed as a society.”

“T-that’s all the time we have for the debate,” the moderator stuttered their words out, “We will return to regular broadcasting soon.”

*That is enough TV for one day*, I thought, before I shuffled to the bedroom. I laid down and waited for sleep to take me.

I was still hungry, so we drove to a ""Arepa"" stand and I ordered one, a side of ""taqueños"" and a drink. Guess what? I was still hungry. Decided to get an iced coffee. Surprise, surprise, I was still hungry. After a little while we got pizza and you know what? I...was...still...hungry. I stopped myself from eating more, but I started to wonder about this sudden hunger. 

On the 27th, I decided to take a home pregnancy test....Shocker....It was positive, two panic attacks later I told my husband. (He told me it was probably a false positive to ease me and helped me breathe). We went to the lab and got blood work done, also positive. I still couldn't believe it, called my OBGYN, I thought like a fool they would do the gel ultrasound thing like in the movies. NOPE...Wand up, no sexy music and in it went. Then...I saw it... like a little firefly glowing on the screen. After all that, I couldn't deny it any more, I was going to be a mother. 6 weeks the doctor said.

It's been only five days since I received the news. Thank the stars I haven't had morning sickness, but the hunger...THE UNCONTROLLABLE HUNGER!!!. I've never felt it like this...This pain makes me cry if I don't eat...and when I do, I feel so full it hurts... it's like the food got stuck at the esophagus or something. It will sit there for a while and then the whole process will start again. Hunger, pain, eat, pain, rinse and repeat. This was not the fun experience I was promised 😅

1n65skf,https://www.reddit.com/r/warsaw/comments/1n65skf/regarding_all_the_recent_day_game_posts_is_it_a/,Regarding all the recent day game posts - is it a social taboo only because of the recordings? Isn't that how people meet naturally?,"Recently, there's been a number of posts about day gaming in Warsaw, and many females expressed discomfort or disgust.

I am genuinely curious though - is ""day gaming"" or ""pick-ups"" a social taboo only because the other party is being recorded?

Because IMO, isn't this how humans are naturally supposed to meet? You see someone interesting, you strike up a convo, ask some Qs to find out about their life, read some social cues - if the other party seems interested, congratz, maybe ask them out for coffee?

This IMO, is WAAAYYY healthier than Tinder / Bumble, where people have unrealistic expectations, where ghosting is encouraged etc.

A common argument I hear is that you can join a hobby group etc, and meet people that way, but isn't that creepier? Joining a hobby group like a Yoga class just to meet females. At least approaching people on the streets makes your intentions clear.

Isn't it also hypocritical that it is socially acceptable to ""pick-up"" at clubs where the other party is usually INTOXICATED and not making rational decisions, while being brutally honest in the day is a social taboo...?

So in conclusion, and out of genuine curiosity:

1. Is day gaming a taboo only because the other person is being recorded

2. Isn't this how humans are naturally supposed to socialize and meet? Pretty sure our grandparents didn't have Tinder and made use of small-talk whenever they met to make connections...",1,1756774090.0,warsaw,0,1.0,False

Smoked at 225 like the recipe said. 6hr total cook time turned into 7hr before the wrap. The stall came earlier than expected: ~132 degrees. At 160, I pulled, wrapped in butcher paper, and put in the oven at 350 til 195, let rest in the warming drawer for an hour. 

My first non-potroast chuck so my expectations may be skewed, but it’s slightly less tender than I’d expected. Still, it came out moist and flavorful with an ok bark.

Perched at the kitchen window in Stevie's apartment with a cup of coffee, Braydon watched the city come to life with the rising sun. He would be late for work either way, but that wasn't the reason he stayed. He kept surprising himself, and frankly, he didn't know what else to make of it — other than to ride the rhythm of the present. He made the deliberate choice to stay, perhaps as an apology for the many times he left. He still wasn't about the ""boyfriend thing,"" but he had made a commitment to simply show up — not just for her, but it inevitably started with her. She was a kind and caring person who deserved more than he ever offered. He stayed to brighten her day — and of course, he always enjoyed her witty company. In a way, he valued the fact that she still didn't judge him, not even after yesterday — or the countless 'yesterdays' before.

Ultimately, he stayed to thank her for who she'd always been — even if it had taken him that long to see it.

A tired grumble came from the doorway. Stevie leaned against the frame rubbing her eyes, making sure the morning light wasn't playing tricks on her. She paused there for a moment, \[...\]

Looking to meet new people (25–31) who actually want to hang out & build a real friendship... don't be a serial killer or trying to like start off killing people with me as your first victim

Hey there 🌸

I’m at a point in life where I’d really love to make some genuine connections. I’m looking for people around 25–31 who are open to chatting, hanging out, and hopefully building a friendship that lasts. I’m pretty chill and respectful, and I really value the same in others.

A little about me:
	•	Lately, I’ve been really into podcasts. If you have recommendations, I’d love to hear them. I even dream of making my own one day—who knows, maybe you could even be a voice in one of my stories.
	•	I’ve recently started getting back into anime—it feels like rediscovering an old comfort.
	•	K-dramas are my thing. If you love them too, we should definitely trade lists and have mini-watch parties.
	•	Fall is my favorite season 🍁—there’s just something about the crisp air, cozy vibes, and all the colors.

What I’m hoping for is pretty simple: I want to meet someone kind, genuine, and respectful—someone who doesn’t just chat online but is actually open to hanging out, grabbing coffee, exploring the city, or just chilling and talking about random things until we lose track of time. I’m not in a rush, but I’d love to find friendships that feel real and lasting.

If you’re in that 25–31 age range and any of this sounds like your vibe, I’d love to hear from you.",1,1756773840.0,Charlotte,0,0.67,False
1n65oen,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1n65oen/praise_for_seattle_coffee_gear_repairs/,Praise for Seattle Coffee Gear repairs,"I know this is the Internet, so we complain more than we praise, but I've got to give a public word of thanks to Seattle Coffee Gear.

I bought a Lelit Mara X from Seattle Coffee Gear in November of last year. It developed a few issues, such as hissing (steam escaping internally from somewhere), other noises (like the pump operating too frequently), and the water valve no longer functioning. It was within the 1-year warranty window, so I contacted Seattle Coffee Gear, which is the West Coast repair center for Lelit.

Long story short, my machine was damaged during UPS shipping. The damage to the frame and water dispenser valve would cost around $900 to replace with new parts plus labor. However, the store refused to honor the $1000 of insurance I purchased. As it turned out, it wasn't either UPS insurance or third-party insurance, but... more like an assurance given by the store? The store owner said the clerk made a mistake, since they only insure packages that they packed. After they initially said they would cover the repairs, they saw the bill. Suddenly, the damage was my problem, and they said that ""we only insure our own packages,"" yet ""none of the packages we pack ever get damaged."" (Yes, I know none of this makes sense... what is the point of insurance, then?) The owner offered me $100 (which was less than the shipping cost), then later in the same conversation, said he would give me the full amount, but I would be banned from his store... for trying to collect on insurance I was sold!

I was at my wits' end with this store and dealing with a serious family health crisis. My partner has stage 4 cancer, and her treatment requires visits to the hospital for chemotherapy treatments and emergency stays of 3-5 days if a problem arises. Let's just say my little espresso machine problem wasn't my biggest worry at the time, and I had my hands full with more important family issues.

I settled with the owner for a modest portion of the repair cost. Because I didn't have the money to repair the Mara X, I assumed I would ask Seattle Coffee Gear to send me back the machine as is, and it would become a hobby machine for me to repair and maintain.

After explaining the basic (although confusing) insurance situation to Seattle Coffee Gear, Heidi, Corey, and Myles were beyond understanding, despite the fact that this was 100% NOT a problem of their creation. They somehow repaired the shipping damage on my machine by bending the bent frame back into shape and locating a used, yet functioning, replacement valve in the shop. Then they addressed all the initial problems that I sent the machine in for, all under warranty. The hissing was the result of bad gaskets, and the hot water valve had stopped working due to scale build-up. (Lesson learned: I'll be using the correct water and descaling regularly from now on.)

I don't know exactly how they did it, but my baby arrived last week looking nearly as good as new! It actually sounds BETTER than new... thinking back on when it first arrived, it sounds much quieter now, even accounting for the increasing hissing from the gaskets over time. I'm thrilled, and although I wish to use my Lelit Mara X for a few more years, I will send my business to Seattle Coffee Gear when I'm looking for a new machine.",4,1756773753.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I found out about this through those youtube channels that do these kind of stories so this is my last resort.

Basically i'm a 34 year old woman, and my husband is 36. We've been married for just under two years and i'm pregnant with our first. Only around three months so far but super excited and nervous.

So, my husband who i'll call Noah just for this, doesn't drink tea. He makes a point not to. Because i'm pregnant and a coffee lover, i've started drinking peppermint or ginger tea when i'm stressed, but only like once a day still to calm me down or wake me up. He calls it 'gross flavoured water' and only drinks coffee, which is fine by me.

Anyway i've had a weird feeling for a while, he's been staying late at work a few times than I thought he would with odd excuses. He's been going out for just a 'drink at the bar' more times than often leaving me at home by myself. I asked him to stay home more and he kind of shrugged it off and half-heartedly apologised.

What made me nervous was last Friday. I came home early from a girls dinner because I was feeling really nauseous, so came home at 10pm exhausted. I enter the house and don't even call for him. There weren't any other shoes or anything so I know no one else was in the house at that time, probably. I just want to have a calming peppermint tea and go to bed.

I go over to our little drinks area and see that the tea box has been swapped with the coffee pods and was at a weird angle. This immediately confuses me since i'm a very particular person about this stuff and he usually doesn't dare touch it. I shrug it off, just thinking he nudged it or something or I don't even know. I open the box and count the tea bags, just to make sure i'm not having more than two a day bc I heard it's bad when you're pregnant? I don't know I get nervous. Anyway I counted 7 in the morning, and now there were 6. Something in me just immediately sets off every single warning bell. I know Noah didn't drink this he hates tea, did he have a friend over? Oh and also I like even numbers, which dictates how many tea's I have in a day, so it was 8 and I had one so it was 7 in the morning etc and was gonna make it 6 myself. Yeah I have OCD, and Noah I don't think would make it uneven. He's usually careful about stuff like that. I make myself the tea, I also notice the kettle is still warm so has been used recently too, I notice this stuff. And we have an espresso machine. 

I go upstairs and find him on his phone in bed, he stands up and gives me hug before i get ready for bed. When i'm in bed I ask him if he had a friend over, he says no pretty quickly. Saying he 'just got home' when I know that isn't true. I don't know I just feel really nervous. I've been thinking about this all weekend, am I just anxious? Is it the pregnancy hormones? I don't know i've been cheated on before and I really don't want this to happen to me when i'm pregnant. Am I Overreacting?",4,1756773537.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

1n65lna,https://www.reddit.com/r/dan_markel_murder/comments/1n65lna/standout_information_in_jeffrey_lacasses/,Standout information in Jeffrey Lacasse's unredacted police interview.,"I just watched the [unredacted third interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVpGpA-Qbno) Jeff Lacasse did with the Tallahassee police on March 6, 2015, 8 months after the murder of Dan Markel. The interview is nearly 2-1/2 hours of Jeffrey speaking very rapidly and there are so many salacious details he gives the cops about Wendi's character. I wonder if any of these allegations will ever see the light of day in court. Here's a list of all the details that stood out to me. I find them fascinating since Wendi has been a stone wall in public and these details, if true, paint a picture of a woman who is a complete psychological mess.

1. Jeffrey repeatedly says he thinks Wendi is a sociopath and a narcissist.
2. He also says that, while going through their divorce, Dan Markel described Wendi to mutual friends ""in a semi-joking manner"" as ""a pathological liar and a mentally ill, narcissistic sociopath.""
3. Jeffrey says that when he began dating Wendi in December of 2013 or January of 2014, his friends warned him, ""Be careful with Wendi. She's a little unbalanced."" But he just thought Wendi was upset about her divorce and thought Dan was out of line saying those things about her.
4. However, by May of 2014, Jeffrey says he knew exactly what Dan was talking about. ""This is a very troubled person, Wendy Adelson. A deeply troubled person,"" he says.
5. He also says that she's very easily influenced by others because she doesn't have a very good sense of self. This is why he worries that she could have something to do with the murder. ""One of the things I worry about is that somebody came up with this idea and she went along with it because she doesn't know how to say no and she hates confrontation,"" he says.
6. He agrees with Dan when he says in divorce court documents that Wendi is a very manipulative person and a pathological liar.
7. Jeffrey says that Wendi was an alcoholic while he was dating her. She ""drank her dinner most nights.""
8. She was very fragile and depressed according to Jeffrey and would fall apart emotionally at the slightest hint of criticism. As an example, he says that a couple of times he pointed out that she was always very focused on herself and asked if they could talk about him, too, sometimes. At this, she would break down crying for two hours, throwing a tantrum. ""I'd never seen anything like it,"" he says.
9. She was on Lexapro, an SSRI class of antidepressant, but taking twice the usual dose prescribed to most people. Later he says that her father the dentist was the one prescribing them. (I had no idea a dentist could do that.) And she was fucking around with the doses and eventually took herself off of them very quickly around March 12 or 13 of 2014 while they were on that alternative spring break trip, without any medical supervision. (Which will fuck you up.) At that point, he says she went from fragile to having total meltdowns at the drop of a hat over anything. He claims that she once had a 6-hour meltdown over a cake not turning out right in the oven. This was the state she was in as the time of the murder approached, he says.
10. He says one of the reasons he went with her on that alternative spring break trip (which was a law school event) is because Wendi is so incapable of managing life on her own. ""She's very childlike. Very much like a 13-year-old girl. I don't know if she could have handled it on her own. I had to do an awful lot of things for her,"" he says. He says that this is why her mom always went up to Tallahassee whenever Wendi needed to go to Miami so they could drive down together. At first he thought her parents were overbearing but after getting to know Wendi, he realized he felt the same way, not wanting her to go on trips on her own because she couldn't handle it.
11. He talks about Charlie and how weird it was that, 20 minutes after meeting him, Charlie was bragging to Jeffrey and Wendi about his sexual escapades with minors in South America. As well as a particularly unsavory story about taking revenge on an Asian woman (in Florida, I think) after he was treated poorly at a wedding at which he was her date. (I don't care to give the gross, SA details because Charlie's already in prison. Jeff's point was that this family is fucking weird and without boundaries.)
12. As I said, during the entire interview Jeffrey is rambling at top speed, so this is a direct quote from him about the fucked up dynamics in the Adelson family. ""There's this odd dynamic between them. The whole family is real weird. Most people that spend time with them say this is, you know, social workers like consider incest in this family, it's violence in this family, something's up with this family.""
13. Once Wendi came off the anti-depressants in April of 2014, her drinking increased. ""She had times where she's just losing her mind. With the kids in the house, drinking a bottle and a half of wine by herself, falling down in the bathroom, bruises,"" Jeffrey says.
14. Jeff gave the cops a long list of men that Wendi was seeing and either definitely sleeping with, or he suspects she was sleeping with behind his back. I guess early in their relationship, it was casual and she was open with Jeff about seeing other men. By March of 2014, he says they were supposed to be in a committed relationship and he eventually realized she was cheating on him the whole time with ""5-10 other men"" that he was in denial about. One of those was David Sack, an ex-boyfriend she supposedly broke up with in September of 2013, before she and Jeff met.
15. Jeff says that he discovered towards the end of their relationship that Wendi continued to sleep with Sack behind his back through May of 2014. Sack was into polyamory and is bisexual and he encouraged Wendi to be more sexually experimental. Jeff says that Wendi is very easily influenced by others because of her weak self-image and so she was partaking in this new lifestyle.
16. He says that Wendi would go to conferences and come home and gloat to Jeff about the men she was seeing and the fun sex she was having. He even went so far as to detail that she'd have red marks on her ass where she'd obviously been spanked.
17. He says it's no crime to sleep around but that Wendi could be very impulsive and engage in risky behavior without thinking things through and then worry about the consequences later. (This sounds to me like some of the symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder. Disclaimer: I am not a medical professional.)
18. She was covering up her cheating pretty well, but then in May he ran into her at a coffee shop with Daniel Sack and he now thinks she might have done it on purpose because she later tried to spin it to their social circle as Jeffrey stalking her. But he says he truly just went there to get some coffee or whatever and ran into them. They got into a fight about what she was doing there with this ex-boyfriend and after that she started being more sloppy about hiding her cheating.
19. Jeffrey says Wendi talks *a lot* and always about herself. (Sounds like Charlie!) Over the course of about a month, he noticed her stories about why she was spending time with Daniel Sack kept changing and he eventually figured out Wendi was cheating on him with Sack.
20. It was also during this time that Wendi said the only way she could relocate from Tallahassee was ""if something happened to Danny.""
21. Jeffrey says that this was the time period that Wendi told him, ""You know, Charlie did look into having him \[Danny\] killed last summer \[2013\]. He was told it would cost about $15,000."" Jeffrey first says this conversation happened sometime between June 20, 2014 and July 13, 2014. Later he remembers that it happened after June 27, 2014 and if he had to put money on it, he says it was probably on July 13, 2014, the Monday before Danny was murdered.
22. Jeffrey says the way Wendi relayed this information felt like the same kind of ""speech pattern"" that she used when she would say something like, ""Daniel Sack and I had coffee yesterday."" ""Well that means her and Daniel Sack had sex all day,"" Jeffrey says. ""That's what that means. That's how she lies. So the fact that she would leak a little bit of it out scares me."" ""It's kind of like, 'I told you half a truth instead of half a lie,'"" says the cop. ""That's how she lies,"" Jeffrey confirms.
23. The weekend of June 27, 2014, Jeffrey caught her cheating again ""with one of her boyfriends"" when he saw on the car GPS that she'd been at a Hilton in Orlando when she wasn't supposed to be anywhere near Orlando. He let her have it (verbally) and, ""she ended up in the fetal position sobbing like a three-year-old.""
24. During this big blowout fight, Jeffrey was crying and Wendi was vacillating between being in the fetal position and, ""laughing and describing some of the experiences she had with other men and making it appear they were very enjoyable,"" Jeffrey said. He said he was ""struck by how cold and callous and basically sociopathic she was. Here I am, I was crying. I was very upset and I said you know, 'You're not a sociopath. You must feel bad about this on a certain level.' And she goes, 'I don't know if I'm a sociopath. I don't feel bad about any of this.'"" Then, he says she would insist that she never said any of it and that he needed to forget the whole topic. He likened her behavior to that of some psych ward patients. ""One minute Wendi was confessing literally telling me, 'I wanted to sexually experiment with people. I wasn't ready.' You know, all this kind of stuff. The next minute, 'I never did that.' I mean, it was like insane.""
25. When they continued this argument later over email, Jeffrey says all she was concerned about was whether Jeffrey was going to tell anyone else in their social circle about her behavior because it's very important to her that she's perceived a certain way. He said she has a public image as a humanitarian who does work to end human trafficking and she doesn't want anything to sully it.
26. After all this, Wendi tells Jeffrey she needs some time to figure out what she wants. (Imagine the nerve.) Since they were on a break, Jeff changed his plans to drive to Atlanta on Friday July 18, 2014 at 10 or 11 am (the date and time of the murder) and instead left on Thursday, July 17, 2014. (This part of the story where Wendi seems to have tried to set Jeff up for the murder is already well known.)
27. That same Thursday, the night before the murder, Jeffrey says that Wendi changed her Facebook pic for the first time in ages to one where she's wearing a purple Victoria's Secret dress that Jeff thinks is really hot. He theorizes she did this because she thought she might be on the news.
28. After Dan Markel was shot, no one in Jeffrey's social circle reached out to him. His friends later told him it was because Wendi was telling them in the days leading up to the murder that Jeff was acting like a jealous stalker and they were worried he might be a suspect.
29. Jeff mentions that he was told that the police found a note in Wendi's calendar that said, ""Talk to Jeff about stalking."" (Lol.) ""If somebody was stalking you, would you need to write yourself a note to remind yourself to talk to somebody about it?"" he asks.
30. Jeff says, ""I talked to her three or four times"" since the murder. This is a list of strange things Wendi said to Jeffrey after the murder.

* Wendi told Jeff, ""I love Tallahassee. I wanted to remain in Tallahassee for the rest of my life.""
* Jeff says, ""I've never heard any sympathy from her one time about Danny. She still seems enraged, obsessed and defiant about Danny.""
* Jeff says, ""Wendi and Charlie went to dinner maybe 3 weeks after the murder and Charlie called it a 'celebration dinner' via text.""
* Jeff says that Wendi puked on the table during that celebration dinner after Charlie said something that she wouldn't tell Jeff. ""She said, 'Charlie made a remark and I just puked everywhere.' (This we already knew.)
* Jeff says when Wendi was recently in town, ""She was cracking jokes about Danny getting his head blown off.""
* Wendi told Jeffrey that the kids are having problems but not because of Danny's murder. ""So the kids are peeing the bed and having natural kid stuff not because of Dan's Murder. That's a really weird thing to say. Most people would say they're upset cuz their father just got killed. It seems to be important to her that they not be because of that.
* She got very upset that Jeffrey attended Danny's memorial service.
* When Jeffrey started dating someone new, Wendi called her up and told her something that blew up the relationship. Jeffrey doesn't know what Wendi told her.
* Jeffrey said Wendi was still telling people he's stalking her at the time of the  interview and that he left town last time he heard she was coming because he fears her.

1. About an hour into the video, the detective leaves the room and [Jeffrey appears to be talking to himself](https://youtu.be/WVpGpA-Qbno?si=4ORkrfL_izfRi2_B&t=3621) saying, ""I love you,"" and then answering, ""I know,"" and raising his hand.

I have the brightest lights installed throughout the house, multiple light panels, infrared / IR panels, blue light glasses, to say I regularly exercise would be an understatement, and I eat exclusively nutritious and excellent homecooked meals complete with tasty treats and coffee. I don’t have a grueling job and I have a sunroom. But as soon as the heavy clouds move in, I get this fog that’s unshakable.

I really want to move to California. I had SAD growing up near Chicago, so I know that climate isn’t suitable even though it’s better than Seattle. But my partner hates every city he’s been to in California and complains when it’s warmer than 65°. Nowhere in the world is sunny and under 65° consistently.

We can’t afford to snowbird. We can probably afford a rundown fixer house in a mid-tier California city though. We would have to leave our community here, and there won’t be another one where we go (I’m not being dramatic this is a fact). So we would be on our own doing this niche activity that Seattle is really the place for, and that is better done in community.

I just feel so backed into a corner and want to give up.

1n65f2c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n65f2c,Reviews from the weekend,"Viva La Vida (Robusto, 11 wks rest)
- Packed, stout cigar with overall nice construction. Rich leather and barn aromas with the distinct Cuban-seed funk coming from the Criollo ’98 fillers. Leathery and earthy, flavors pop about an inch or two in with creaminess and honey up front. Black pepper and the usual bold AJ profile is present. Rather dry and oaky in the second half, joined by a much-welcomed touch of maple sweetness and toasted caramel. Full strength in the last third. A very good cigar.

Don Pepin Vegas Cubanas (Corona, 4 mos rest)
- Great vitola, well-constructed. Cedar and spice-heavy, standard corojo fare. Red and black pepper more in flavor than heat. Bready, nutty, honey notes come and go. Toasty towards the finish. Decent smoke but nothing I’ll be rushing to return to. 

Adventura Blue Eyed Jack’s Revenge (Corona, 2.5 mos rest)
- Mottled, gritty, fairly oily wrapper with a couple blemishes and soft spots. Cold draw is very sweet and chocolatey. Initial flavors are extremely light, cedar and a touch of coffee. Linear through the first half. Flaky ash, frequent touch-ups needed. A bit of earth joins halfway but largely flavorless so far. Burn troubles accelerate in the second, eventually unsmokable. Cigar does not seem over-humidified but simply will not burn. Will chalk this up to a dud and give the other 2 sticks I have extended humi time.

EP Carrillo Pledge (Toro, 6 wks rest)
- First time smoking one of these, amazingly. Mottled, rustic (not pretty) look akin to other blends in the line. Very earthy, dry smoke in the first 3rd. Leather, toasted caramel, umami, espresso. Toasty charred meat flavors join along with some baking spice and cinnamon. Second 3rd is very savory, reminds me a lot of Le Careme by CH. Meaty, smoky bbq flavors explode with a few inches to go. Salt, oats and granola notes present as well. Very complex and tasty cigar. Burn is fairly wavy but does self-correct. Excellent stick that will be in regular rotation.

Diesel Rage (Corona Gorda, 4.5 mos rest)
- Packed solid, even roll. Smooth, paper-like wrapper with a touch of oil. Dark cocoa, coffee, earth from the start. Black pepper is strong on the nose. Astringent quality to the smoke. In the second third malts jump to the front. Finish continues to lengthen and is very bold. Creaminess and vanilla bean join. The chocolate malts are absolutely screaming by halfway. Espresso moves up front too. The entire second half is a sweet spot, I’ve never had such a rich chocolate malt profile. Delicious cigar, highly recommend. Extended rest is need for these, like all Diesel sticks.

An Expert Guide for Bahrain Company Formation in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business people professional, businessmen meeting, corporate professionals.. The rush is palpable as owners and consultants hover, hoping for a quick stamp, knowing that every minute lost means a queue forming in Seef District’s Sijilat lounge. The air buzzes—new digital signage everywhere promising faster licensing… if, and only if, your business supports mandatory digital payments.\
But a coffee shop owner from Bahrain Bay I knew—let’s call him Yousif—leans in, asking if he really must offer credit card payments for every transaction, or if certain small setups can run cash-only. This question is everywhere these days, as Bahrain tightens its digital payment requirements, especially after the 2025 regulatory update widely covered by Reuters and Forbes Business.\
I’ve worked through these regulations firsthand more times than I can count. Today, I’ll show what actual exemptions exist for digital payments, who qualifies, and the real cost-benefit breakdown for your Bahrain company formation journey.\
\
Bahrain’s 2025 Business Environment: Digital, Dynamic, and Still Human\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting. and Reuters reports, Bahrain’s non-oil sector grew over 5.2% in Q1 2025, led by fintech, hospitality, and logistics. Government initiatives—backed by Tamkeen and EDB—have fueled a surge in new business registrations, with over 18,500 entities established as of June 2025.\
Digital transformation is at the heart of this boom. The 2025 mandate from the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) now requires many businesses to offer at least one digital payment method at the point of sale, and electronic invoicing is becoming the norm.\
However, Bahrain still values its traditions. Business in a majlis often starts with dates and coffee before you ever see a laptop. During Ramadan, business hours shift and digital response times suffer. Yet, the push for financial inclusion remains relentless.\
For a deeper dive into Bahrain’s growth metrics and business policy, visit Gulf News Bahrain and the official Bahrain government site.\
\
What Are the Digital Payment Requirements in Bahrain?\
The basics: Since 2023 and reinforced by the new 2025 CBB circular, all commercial entities with a point-of-sale interface—be it a fixed store, kiosk, or e-commerce checkout—must enable at least one recognized digital payment channel (debit/credit card, BenefitPay, or approved payment gateway).\
\
In practice, this requirement aims to cut cash handling, reduce tax evasion, and encourage transparency—clear priorities if you’ve ever navigated Sijilat’s compliance queue at 11 a.m. on a Sunday.\
\
Who Enforces the Rules?\
\
Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB)\
Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism (MOICT)\
National e-Payment Gateway (BenefitPay)\
\
Key 2025 Policy Update\
On March 1, 2025, the CBB increased on-site inspections and instant fines for non-compliant retail setups. Non-compliance now carries a BHD 500 penalty per incident, up from BHD 250. All new CR applications in Sijilat must declare and, if required, prove their digital payment setups before license activation.\
\
Are Any Business Types Exempt from Digital Payment Requirements?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.\
A. Micro/Small-Scale Businesses in Designated Areas\
\
Street vendors with no fixed premises (e.g., Adliya’s evening food stalls)\
Traditional souq vendors with annual turnover  Tip: If you’re unsure, MOICT’s Sijilat web portal now provides an “Exemption Request” button. Don’t skip this—fines are automate.\
\
\
Practical Examples Based on Firsthand Experience\
Take my client from the Diplomatic Area, operating a law consultancy. He believed digital payment requirements didn’t apply since most clients paid via bank transfer. MOICT disagreed—any firm advertising walk-in consultations must accept at least one digital payment channel, even if only 5% of transactions are walk-in.\
Example: Local Carpet Weaver in Hamad Town\
\
Annual revenue: BHD 8,000\
Business model: cash sales to walk-in clients\
Application: Sijilat exemption request, supported by neighborhood majlis head’s letter\
\
Outcome: Approved. However, exemption limited to 2025 renewal period, subject to CBB review.\
Example: Food Truck at Bahrain Bay\
\
Revenue: BHD 80,000 (high season)\
Attempted exemption: denied—CBB considers high-volume mobile vendors “retail outlets,” trigger digital payment requirement\
Fix: Enrolled with BenefitPay, monthly cost BHD 12\
\
\
Key insight: any business “mobile but high turnover” triggers compliance. If you’re scaling up, plan accordingly.\
\
\
Cost Considerations: How Much to Budget for Digital Payment Compliance?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.\
\
BenefitPay merchant onboarding: BHD 30 setup + BHD 10-25 monthly fee, transaction rate ~1.5%\
Bank POS terminal: BHD 50-150 installation + 1.75% transaction fee, refunded after one year if minimum volume met\
Online payment gateway (Tap, PayTabs, etc.): Setup BHD 25-50, monthly fee BHD 15-35, transaction rate 2.2%-2.9%\
\
Budget range for micro-businesses:\
Initial: BHD 50-200, Monthly: BHD 10-30\
For retail/foodservice with more than one POS:\
Initial: BHD 250-400, Monthly: BHD 30-60\
See here for a full breakdown of Bahrain company formation costs.\
Money-Saving Insider Tips\
\
Apply for Tamkeen’s “SME Digitalization Package”—rebates up to BHD 500 for eligible startups.\
Register with two payment providers to compare rates; some banks waive three months’ fees for new merchants (I once saved BHD 75 on a single license cycle this way).\
For quick setup, schedule Sijilat application between 9:45-10:30 a.m. Tuesday—lowest queue (personal observation after 130+ filings).\
\
\
Step-by-Step Guidance: Navigating Compliance and Exemption Requests\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation. copy\
- Lease agreement or landlord’s letter (for micro/home-based exemptions)\
- Financial summary (turnover statement, last 12 months)\
- Proof of business type (trade license, event permit, NGO certificate)\
- Letter from a local authority or majlis leader, if applicable\
Shortcut: In most Sijilat requests, uploading a PDF bank statement with revenue summary plus a photo of your setup (stall, workroom) speeds approval by 2-3 days.\
2. Apply via Sijilat Portal (Commercial Registration in Bahrain)\
\
Log in, select “Digital Payment Exemption Request”\
Upload docs, select business type, justify request (be concise; “seasonal, cash-only, low turnover” works best)\
Receive SMS/Email notification on approval or further document request\
\
3. Follow Up in Person (If Urgent)\
\
Head to the MOICT Sijilat office in Seef District\
Bring originals—sometimes, verbal explanation in Arabic helps (my Arabic isn’t perfect, but showing up in person cut my last review from 5 days to 40 minutes).\
During Ramadan, go before 11 a.m.\
\
4. Digital Payment Registration (If Required)\
\
Connect with local banks or BenefitPay partners immediately after CR approval\
E-invoicing setup (most providers offer 2-hour training sessions)\
\
\
Mistake alert: Many skip the “activation” step—be sure your device is tested and prints digital receipts before opening. Inspectors often check by midnight on launch day.\
\

\
Compliance, Accounting, and Post-Formation Nuances\
!(\
- Annual renewal requires digital payment compliance confirmation\
- Randomized site inspections (MOICT/CBB cross-check)\
- Bookkeeping: All digital payment transactions must be reconciled with monthly accounts\
I recommend outsourcing to a Bahrain-based accounting provider with strong digital capabilities—KeyLink’s accounting and bookkeeping services are reliable and priced better than most boutique consultancies.\
\
Side note: Bahrain’s regulatory culture prioritizes relationship-building. I once accelerated a delayed exemption by following up with a short, respectful WhatsApp message to the Sijilat desk manager after meeting him at a Bahrain Bay networking breakfast (don’t underestimate in-person rapport).\
\
\
Business Structure Choices: How They Impact Payment Compliance\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.: Rarely exempt—seen as commercial by default.\
- Single Person Company: Micro-entities allowed to apply for exemptions, but rare success in retail/hospitality.\
- Branch/Subsidiary: Parent company’s payment protocols required.\
- Sole Proprietorship:** Odds of exemption slightly higher, especially in home-based/seasonal models.\
Learn more about Bahrain business type structures to match your business model to compliance ease.\
\
Ownership, Sponsorship, and Digital Payment Implications\
\
Foreign Ownership (up to 100%): See activities list—some activities allow 99% or 100% foreign ownership. No impact on digital payment requirement; compliance is universal.\
Local Sponsorship: Required only for certain regulated sectors. See local sponsorship guidance.\
\
Surprisingly, free zone companies (Bahrain Logistics Zone, BAPCO Free Zone) face identical digital payment rules. Avoid assuming a free zone means flexibility—see free zones info.\
For foreign owners considering Bahrain vs. UAE or Saudi Arabia: Bahrain’s digital payment enforcement is less aggressive than the UAE’s (where fines are higher and enforcement is rigid), but more thorough than in Saudi, where cash transactions remain common in some areas.\
\
Insider Perspectives on Bahrain’s Business Culture\
\
Majlis-Style Meetings: Building trust is as important as compliance. Bring small talk, accept coffee, and listen before making requests.\
Ramadan Adjustments: Expect slower government response after 2 p.m., but early-morning visits often yield surprisingly fast paperwork approvals (I learned this after weeks of late-afternoon dead ends).\
Traditional Coffee Service: Accepting a cup before official business can open doors—in one case, a refused coffee meant a delayed file review.\
\
\
A Tangent (That Matters): Why Bahrain’s Coffee Culture Actually Influences Digital Payment Adoption\
One might think this is off-topic, but bear with me. The age-old tradition of serving coffee before business talks has led to a unique dynamic—in smaller businesses, especially in areas like Muharraq or the souqs, the slow pace of traditional interaction shapes attitudes toward cash and digital. These cultural nuances are why the CBB softened digital payment mandates for micro-entities and why, if you watch closely, cash-only coffee stalls still thrive in Bahrain Bay’s weekend markets.\
\
The intersection of custom and policy is where Bahrain’s business charm and regulatory flexibility truly meet.\
\
\
Recommended Resources and Service Providers\
My go-to for expedited digital payment setup: BenefitPay’s team at Bahrain Financial Harbour—they accept walk-ins before 11:15 a.m., and processing is 50% faster than most bank branches. For accounting, KeyLink’s professional team consistently solves digital transaction reconciliation—with far less headache than DIY solutions.\
\
Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\
Mistake: Delaying Digital Setup Until Opening Day\
\
Prevention: Start application process at least 7 working days pre-launch. Test system live—don’t wait until Sijilat inspector arrives.\
\
Mistake: Underestimating Document Proof Needs\
\
Prevention: Always bring physical and digital copies of all supporting documents, including proof of business area and turnover.\
\
Mistake: Relying on Verbal Exemptions\
\
Prevention: Get every promise in writing from MOICT/Sijilat; verbal guarantees may not stand during inspections (I learned this lesson after a client’s cash-only license was revoked without appeal).\
\
\
Practical FAQ: Digital Payment Exemptions and Bahrain Company Formation\
1. Can I apply for a digital payment exemption after my business launches?\
Yes, but approval is limited. Submit your request directly through the Sijilat portal and be prepared for a site visit and revenue audit.\
2. Do free zone companies receive special exemptions from digital payment rules?\
No. Free zone or not, all businesses with direct customer sales must comply. See benefits and limitations of Bahrain free zones.\
3. Can 100% foreign-owned businesses operate with cash-only policies?\
Only micro-entities in specific circumstances may receive exemption, regardless of ownership. Standards are enforced equally; check allowed activity codes for details.\
4. What’s the fastest way to get digital payment facilities activated?\
Visit BenefitPay’s Bahrain Financial Harbour desk before 11 a.m.; bring your CR number, copy of bank account details, and stamp. Approval usually takes under an hour.\
5. Where can I find a detailed guide on Bahrain company formation with compliance tips?\
Explore the KeyLink Bahrain company formation resource for updated, step-by-step professional support, fee structures, and compliance checklists.\
\
\
Expert opinion: Building a Bahrain business means embracing both the digital future and the personal—sometimes analog—present. With preparation, the right resources, and a respectful nod to local customs, navigating digital payment requirements (and exemptions) saves both time and money, while opening the door to Bahrain’s rapidly growing market.\

Yeah, I like you. You’re exciting. Cute. I was foolish to mistake my affection for love, but hey, I never claimed to be smart. I live with the faeries sometimes, it’s just my nature.

I was asking myself earlier “what do I *actually* desire?” And I came to a beautiful conclusion.

I desire a fat spliff and a face to ride. Hot coffee. Strong hands to hold me in place. I need attention. Adoration, darling. Can’t live without it.

I desire teasing chats, jokes that make me laugh until my sides ache, interesting conversations. Solid friendships. Cats that come to say hello when I’m outside. Pretty shoes that make me 5 inches taller. People who start dialogue with me first and enjoy my presence. Scented candles that never last long enough. Fresh bread that takes too long to make.

I’m a highly social introvert. I love connecting with people, but prefer one-on-one. I enjoy trading life stories and weird ideas. Equal parts nerd and jock. (It’s a false dichotomy!) Left-leaning politics. I’m a chill stoic in public, but real loquacious when the right person gets me going.

I’m 6’2” and 175lbs. I have a trim salt & pepper beard, a shaved head, and piercing blue eyes. One earring, a couple of tattoos, and one cool scar. I’m on the fit side of dadbod. I lift big weights and run around outside a lot, and it shows. But I like baking too much to ever have abs. Happy to trade photos right away.

I’ve had a wild ride making lots of unusual life choices that have worked out really well for me. Some things I’ve been:

* Molecular biologist
* Library page
* Nuclear reactor operator (not the evil kind!)
* Street fair artisan
* Indie game dev
* Software engineering manager
* Co-founder & CTO

I’m incredibly lucky to be my own boss, work from home (or coffee shops), and set my own hours.

In my free time I’m equal parts nerdy and athletic:

* In the last year I’ve hiked/biked/kayaked more than 2,800 miles, the width of the contiguous US.
* I recently took up indoor climbing.
* Read a lot, mostly sci-fi and fantasy. Trading media recs is a love language.
* Big coffee nerd. I own a totally sensible number of espresso machines. Working on my latte art.
* D&D. More often a DM, but currently a player in a Candlekeep campaign.
* I do a little 3D printing.
* Occasional gamer. Just started HZD:FW.
* I’ve been SCUBA certified.
* I play the violin passably well. I know a handful of songs on guitar, and maybe two on piano.

This list goes on and on. I collect hobbies & skills, and would love it if you teach me something.

I’m an experienced kinkster. A slow burn dom — I prefer to get to know each other as people before we dive into a dynamic. But once we dive in, I’ll go as deep as you want. Though I don’t come across aggressively toppy at first, it is definitely part of my personality, and some experienced subs clock me right away.

Cats love me. All cats. I was raised by a pack of wild house cats (true story) and speak their language.

***The poly stuff:***

I’ve been poly since I was a teenager. All my relationships have been ENM. I’m out to friends and family.

I’m married and nesting. We date separately. I’m good with parallel, but also down with KTP if you want to introduce me to your polycule. One of my best friends started as a meta.

What I can offer:

* Frequent dates
* Even more frequent communication
* Overnights, weekends, vacations
* Feelings (that’s kinda the point!)
* Responsible hinging. My time, commitments, and boundaries are my own.

What I can’t offer:

* I’m not looking to cohabitate, combine finances, or reproduce any more.
* My house is primarily where my kids live. So for me “hosting” looks like nice hotels and airbnbs. If you have a place that is more conducive to sharing, I’m also more than happy to contribute groceries, cooking, cleaning, etc.

I’m best suited to partners with some natural hierarchy in their own lives. E.g. you have a spouse, a nesting partner, kids, a high-powered career, or are married to the sea. Or you’re solo poly and value your independence. 

***What I’m looking for:***

Fellow nerds, outdoor adventurers, and neurodivergents. A good communicator, especially other extroverted introverts. I get along well with artists & writers, engineers & scientists, and eclectic witchy types.

***If this all sounds good to you:***

1n65an1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1n65an1/i_was_obsessed_with_reading_until_i_became_an/,I was obsessed with reading until I became an adult,"I remember as a child, I was obsessed with books. I grew up really sheltered with strict parents, so I didn’t get out of the house much to hang out with friends, etc. Rather than watching movies or TV shows, I preferred reading and getting lost in a book. I would wake up and immediately start reading, even when I was eating, peeing, showering (I would put my book in a ziplock bag and would wipe my hand to take out the book and turn the page, and I’d do this for like over an hour), and pull all nighters until I finished my book. I’d often read 1-2 books a day. 

But once I became an adult, I had way more obligations, responsibilities, and overall less time. And that’s when I felt the aversion to reading. I have discovered I still love reading, but I can only do it if I know I can finish or read most of it in one sitting. Which is why I would happily start a book while at the airport, knowing I’d be able to finish on my flight. 

My husband is the type of reader to nibble on a book. Like read a few chapters before bed, or while at a coffee shop. I want to be like that because I love books and I have so many in my backlog, but the thought of picking it up, knowing I cannot dedicate the next 24 hours to it, makes me have almost an ick to reading. Also, if I start reading a book I like before bed, I will not sleep until I finish it (and I have adult things to do like work, and I truly need sleep in order to not feel overwhelmed or burnt-out), so that’s also another reason why I avoid it.

1n658ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiReviewInsider/comments/1n658ix/exciting_ai_breakthroughs_of_2025_top_advances/,Exciting AI Breakthroughs of 2025: Top Advances You Need to Know,"2025 is already shaping up to be the year AI shifted from being a buzzword into a daily, life-changing force. For years, headlines promised us everything from miracle medical tools to robots that could clean your kitchen, but most of those stories ended up being hype, half-baked demos, or projects locked in research labs.

This year is different. We’re finally seeing **AI breakthroughs that are not just theoretical but real, tested, and scaling into the world**. Doctors are running trials with AI-powered stethoscopes that can detect heart problems in seconds. New brain-inspired reasoning models are closing in on human-like problem-solving efficiency. And the long-awaited GPT-5 is here-smarter, multimodal, and emotionally intelligent in ways earlier AI systems couldn’t pull off.

On top of that, Nvidia is rewriting the rules of AI hardware, the UK is putting a **public supercomputer** into service for healthcare and climate science, and AI scientists are literally publishing peer-reviewed research without human authors. Robotics, art, creativity, and autonomous AI agents-everything is moving at breakneck speed.

If you’ve been following AI casually through TikTok demos, Reddit threads, or tech news, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Which breakthroughs actually matter? Which are smoke and mirrors? And which ones will quietly reshape your job, your health, or your daily life?

This blog breaks it all down. No jargon. No sugarcoating. Just the **most important AI breakthroughs of 2025 explained in detail**, with proof from clinical trials, benchmarks, and real-world applications.

# AI-Powered Medical Diagnostics at Breakneck Speed

Healthcare has always been the proving ground for whether AI is truly useful or just hype. In 2025, it’s clear: AI-powered medical diagnostics are crossing the line from *interesting research* to *life-saving tools*. And at the center of this shift is something deceptively simple: an **AI stethoscope**.

**AI Stethoscope Diagnosing Heart Conditions in Seconds**

Imagine walking into a primary care clinic. Instead of waiting weeks for referrals, tests, and cardiologist reviews, a nurse places a stethoscope on your chest. Within **15 seconds**, the device’s AI model not only hears your heartbeat but also analyzes subtle waveform patterns and flags possible **heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or structural issues**\-conditions that traditionally required complex tests like echocardiograms.

This isn’t a prototype. As of early 2025, **clinical pilots are running across the U.S. and Europe** with AI stethoscopes trained on millions of annotated heart sound recordings. According to results reported on **Trustpilot and G2 from early adopters in hospitals**, both clinicians and patients describe it as “transformative” because it reduces **diagnostic bottlenecks** and brings cardiology-level insight directly to frontline care.

For comparison:

* Traditional stethoscopes rely on physician interpretation (which can miss early-stage issues).  
* AI-enhanced stethoscopes detect **micro-anomalies invisible to human ears** by combining acoustic analysis with deep-learning heart models.  

This is the same shift we saw with **AI in radiology**, where computer vision models began outperforming radiologists at detecting early-stage tumors-but now it’s moving to **point-of-care devices** that can be used anywhere, not just in labs.

**Clinical Trial Results for Accuracy in Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation**

The credibility of any medical AI rests on **clinical trials**, and the AI stethoscope has cleared early hurdles impressively.

* **Heart Failure Detection**: In a multi-center trial across 12 hospitals, the AI model reached an **AUC (Area Under the Curve) score of 0.94**, outperforming many cardiologists’ initial assessments.  
* **Atrial Fibrillation**: When compared to ECG-confirmed diagnoses, the AI stethoscope achieved **91% sensitivity and 89% specificity**, making it reliable enough to recommend immediate follow-up testing.  
* **Scalability**: Since the stethoscope is portable and cloud-connected, it’s already being tested in **low-resource regions** where access to cardiologists is scarce.  

Published datasets on **Papers With Code** and **clinical preprints on arXiv** confirm that AI stethoscopes are not just demos but **replicable, benchmarked systems**.

Reddit discussions in r/medicine and r/futurology highlight an important cultural shift: doctors who were once skeptical are now sharing case stories of patients diagnosed early thanks to AI assistance. That’s the kind of **grassroots validation** that usually predicts large-scale adoption.

**Impact on Primary Care and Early Intervention**

Primary care is often where **preventable conditions slip through the cracks**. Patients present vague symptoms, general practitioners are overloaded, and subtle heart issues go unnoticed until they escalate.

AI stethoscopes change this dynamic:

* **Early Intervention**: A flagged diagnosis means earlier cardiology referrals, preventing hospitalizations.  
* **Reduced Costs**: Detecting heart failure early saves **tens of thousands per patient** in emergency and ICU costs.  
* **Democratization of Expertise**: Clinics without cardiologists gain frontline diagnostic power.  

This aligns with the trend of **AI decentralizing expertise**, allowing frontline tools to bridge the gap between generalists and specialists. The **WHOIS and BuiltWith scans** of startups in this space show they’re not fringe players-they’re backed by significant venture rounds, validated by regulatory sandboxes, and scaling globally.

**Personal Experience**

When my own father went for a routine check-up earlier this year, his doctor casually tested an AI stethoscope as part of the pilot program. It flagged possible atrial fibrillation. He had never noticed symptoms. Follow-up ECG confirmed the issue-and it was caught early enough to avoid a hospitalization that could have easily blindsided us. Seeing that play out made me realize these tools aren’t “future healthcare,” they’re already **quietly saving lives**.

**Famous Book Insight**

In *The Innovator’s Prescription* (Clayton Christensen, Chapter 3), Christensen explains how **disruptive technologies in healthcare thrive when they decentralize expertise and lower costs** without reducing quality. The AI stethoscope embodies this idea perfectly: it doesn’t replace cardiologists but shifts powerful diagnostics earlier in the chain, making advanced care more accessible.

# Nvidia’s Push in Next-Gen AI Hardware & Robotics

If AI models are the “brains,” then hardware is the “nervous system” powering them. Without massive GPUs and optimized chips, GPT-5, HRMs, and liquid networks would remain stuck in labs. Nvidia knows this - and in 2025, it has rolled out a **triple wave of breakthroughs**: the **Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin AI chips**, a new robotics model called **Isaac GR00T N1**, and an entire safety/coordination platform called **Cosmos AI with Halos**.

This is the section where compute, robotics, and infrastructure collide - and it explains why Nvidia’s stock price, community buzz on Reddit, and adoption in enterprises all exploded this year.

**Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin Chips**

Nvidia’s **Blackwell Ultra GPUs** are being touted as the most advanced AI accelerators in history. Built for **trillion-parameter model training and edge deployment**, they outpace the H100 and B200 generations with staggering improvements:

* **Compute Efficiency**: Blackwell Ultra delivers **4.5x higher FLOPs per watt** compared to Hopper chips, reducing training costs dramatically.  
* **Low-Latency Edge Use**: With architecture tuned for **low-power inference**, the chips are already being used in hospital servers and autonomous robots.  
* **Bandwidth Scaling**: Integrated **photonic interconnects** mean GPUs communicate faster with each other, solving one of the biggest bottlenecks in distributed training.  

Alongside Blackwell Ultra, Nvidia launched the **Vera Rubin chips** \- designed not for cloud giants but for **scientific computing and public-good projects**. These chips are optimized for **climate modeling, cancer detection, and space simulation**, showing Nvidia’s ambition to power not just AI startups but global science initiatives.

On **PitchBook and Crunchbase**, funding announcements reveal dozens of startups building on Vera Rubin’s architecture specifically for **medical imaging and weather prediction markets**. On Reddit, r/hardware enthusiasts describe these chips as *“the GPUs you don’t flex in your gaming rig but the ones saving lives.”*

**New Isaac GR00T N1 Robotics Model**

While GPUs are headline grabbers, robotics has been Nvidia’s **quiet second front**. The release of **Isaac GR00T N1** in 2025 is a landmark: a foundational model for **robot intelligence** trained on massive multimodal datasets of motion, physics, and human demonstrations.

Key capabilities:

* **Universal Motor Skills**: GR00T N1 can control robotic arms, quadrupeds, and drones with the same core model, instead of task-specific training.  
* **Simulation-to-Real Transfer**: Robots trained in Nvidia’s Omniverse simulations seamlessly adapt to real-world physics, cutting costs of robotics deployment.  
* **Integration with Liquid Networks**: GR00T N1 is optimized to run hybrid architectures, making robots both flexible and context-aware.  

One industrial case study: A logistics company integrated GR00T N1 with robotic pickers. Within days, robots learned to handle fragile items like glassware and textiles - tasks that usually break traditional automation systems.

On Reddit’s r/Futurology, clips of humanoids controlled by GR00T N1 stacking boxes, climbing stairs, and reacting to humans are sparking debates: *“Are we entering the Tesla Bot moment, but with real software behind it?”*

**Cosmos AI Platform and Halos Safety System**

Nvidia didn’t stop at hardware and models. Recognizing safety concerns, it rolled out the **Cosmos AI platform** with an embedded **Halos safety system**.

* **Cosmos AI** is essentially Nvidia’s “operating system for AI robotics.” It manages fleets of robots, optimizes workloads across GPUs, and integrates vision-language-action (VLA) models for real-world decision-making.  
* **Halos Safety Layer** continuously monitors robot behavior, flagging dangerous actions before they happen. Think of it as an **AI co-pilot for AI robots**, ensuring alignment with safety protocols.  

Why this matters: if robots are going to scale beyond factories into healthcare, retail, and homes, **safety oversight cannot be an afterthought**. Nvidia’s Halos is earning early praise on **Capterra reviews from enterprise users**, who report that it reduces accident risk in warehouses by dynamically adjusting robot policies in real time.

On Reddit’s r/technology, one upvoted comment summed it up: *“For once, safety isn’t a slide deck - it’s in the system itself.”*

**Personal Experience**

I recently attended a robotics expo where Nvidia demoed GR00T N1 running on Blackwell Ultra chips. Watching a humanoid robot adapt to unscripted tasks - like catching a ball thrown by an audience member - was surreal. What struck me wasn’t the spectacle but the **smoothness**. No jerky motions, no obvious lag. It looked… normal. For robotics, “normal” is the revolution.

**Famous Book Insight**

In *The Second Machine Age* (Erik Brynjolfsson & Andrew McAfee, Chapter 5), the authors describe how major economic shifts often occur not from flashy inventions but from **infrastructure breakthroughs that enable dozens of industries simultaneously**. Nvidia’s 2025 hardware and robotics stack is precisely that kind of infrastructure shift - not just GPUs for AI models but the **foundation for embodied intelligence at scale**.

# UK’s Isambard-AI Supercomputer for Public Good

When people think about cutting-edge AI, they usually imagine OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. But in 2025, the UK surprised the world with **Isambard-AI**, Europe’s most powerful publicly accessible AI supercomputer. With a staggering **5,400 GPUs** in its initial deployment, it’s built to push forward **scientific research and healthcare innovations** \- not just corporate profit.

This move matters because it signals a **shift in AI accessibility**. Instead of breakthroughs being locked in Silicon Valley data centers, scientists and researchers across Europe can tap into Isambard-AI for projects with massive social impact.

**5,400 GPU Power for Science and Healthcare**

Isambard-AI is powered by **Nvidia’s latest Blackwell Ultra GPUs**, optimized for **scientific AI workloads**. Its raw numbers are eye-popping:

* **5,400 GPUs**, linked with advanced photonic interconnects.  
* **Exascale performance levels**, ranking it among the top five supercomputers globally as of mid-2025.  
* Designed for **AI + HPC (high-performance computing)** hybrid workloads, combining simulation and deep learning in one platform.  

What does that mean in practice? It means researchers can run models that would have been impossible on university clusters before:

* **Genomics**: Mapping genetic variants linked to disease at population scale.  
* **Drug Discovery**: Screening billions of compounds against protein structures using AI-accelerated simulations.  
* **Climate Modeling**: Generating localized climate predictions at resolutions never before possible.  

This isn’t speculative - published reports on **Papers With Code** and EU-funded research show Isambard-AI already accelerating breakthroughs in **cancer diagnostics and climate resilience models**.

**Applications in Cancer Detection and Agriculture**

Two areas stand out for early applications: **healthcare** and **agriculture**.

1. **Cancer Detection**
   * Research groups in London are training multimodal diagnostic models that combine radiology scans, biopsy images, and genomic data.  
   * With Isambard-AI, they can train these models at scale, achieving accuracy levels that rival private medical AI startups.  
   * One project published in *Nature Medicine (2025, Vol. 31)* showed a **15% improvement in early-stage cancer detection rates** compared to traditional radiology methods.  
2. **Agriculture**
   * AI models trained on Isambard-AI are already being used to optimize **crop resilience under climate stress**.  
   * By integrating satellite imagery, soil samples, and weather predictions, these systems help farmers adjust irrigation and fertilizer use dynamically.  
   * Field trials in East Anglia report **20% higher yields with reduced water usage**, according to UK government press releases.  

On Reddit’s r/ukpolitics and r/futurology, the public response has been overwhelmingly supportive - with many users framing Isambard-AI as “finally, AI for people, not just for shareholders.”

**Ethical Oversight and Access Policies**

The most significant differentiator between Isambard-AI and corporate labs is **ethical oversight and accessibility**.

* **Open Access Model**: Universities, non-profits, and startups can apply for compute credits at subsidized rates, ensuring small teams aren’t priced out.  
* **Ethical Review Boards**: Research projects must undergo approval to ensure compliance with privacy, data ethics, and safety standards.  
* **Transparency**: Unlike private AI labs, Isambard-AI publishes compute usage reports and makes datasets accessible where legally possible.  

This sets a precedent: **governments can build public AI infrastructure with accountability baked in**. It’s a stark contrast to controversies around closed AI models that hoard data and hide training practices.

On **Trustpilot and G2**, early feedback from researchers emphasizes not just the power of the system but also the **fairness of the access model** \- especially compared to commercial cloud platforms charging premium rates.

**Personal Experience**

One of my closest friends is a PhD student in computational biology at a UK university. For years, she struggled with limited GPU access, waiting weeks for her models to run. In 2025, her team got access to Isambard-AI. She told me she trained models in **two days that would’ve taken three months before**. That acceleration didn’t just save time - it meant she could iterate, experiment, and push her research forward in ways that were simply impossible before.

**Famous Book Insight**

In *The Wealth of Nations* (Adam Smith, Book V, Chapter I), Smith writes about the responsibility of governments to invest in **public works that private interests may neglect**, especially when they serve long-term societal benefit. The UK’s Isambard-AI embodies this principle: it’s not built for immediate profit but for **public-good research that private corporations often sideline**.

# Autonomous General-Purpose AI Agents

If GPT-5 is the leap in intelligence and multimodality, **Autonomous AI agents** are the leap in *action*. Instead of waiting for humans to prompt them, these systems can **reason, plan, and execute tasks across domains** with minimal supervision. They bridge the gap between AI as “conversation partner” and AI as “co-worker who gets things done.”

The star of 2025 in this space is **Manus AI**, a system designed to unify reasoning with task execution, enabling AI to operate independently across industries from healthcare to finance.

**Manus AI Uniting Reasoning with Task Execution**

What makes Manus AI remarkable is its **integration of symbolic reasoning with practical action systems**:

* **Reasoning Core**: Built on a variant of hierarchical reasoning models (HRMs), Manus AI can break down complex objectives into modular steps.  
* **Execution Layer**: Connected to APIs, robotic systems, and enterprise software, it can *act* on those steps directly - not just suggest them.  
* **Autonomy**: Manus AI runs continuous feedback loops, monitoring outcomes and self-correcting without constant human oversight.  

Example use case (reported on G2): A hospital integrated Manus AI into its patient management system. Instead of staff manually scheduling, re-ordering, and chasing records, Manus AI coordinated across systems automatically, cutting admin work by **40%**.

Reddit’s r/artificial community has been buzzing with real-world experiments: small businesses deploying Manus AI as an “operations manager,” individuals running it to manage their personal finances, and developers using it to run code-debugging tasks overnight.

**Cross-Industry Applications in Healthcare and Finance**

1. **Healthcare**  
   * Manus AI handles **clinical trial coordination**, pulling data from labs, scheduling follow-ups, and updating regulatory forms.  
   * Hospitals use it for **inventory management** \- forecasting shortages of critical supplies and reordering without human intervention.  
2. **Finance**  
   * Banks are deploying Manus AI for **fraud detection workflows**, where it autonomously investigates flagged transactions, compiles reports, and escalates only when needed.  
   * Asset managers use it for **portfolio balancing**: Manus AI integrates live feeds, evaluates risks, and executes trades within guardrails.  

The key is that Manus isn’t a domain-specific bot. It’s a **general-purpose agent** that can jump from analyzing spreadsheets to controlling robots - something LLMs alone couldn’t manage.

Benchmark results on the **LMSYS Agent Arena** show Manus AI outperforming GPT-4-based agents on long-horizon planning tasks, with a **37% higher completion rate** on multi-step objectives.

**Bridge Between Human Intent and Machine Action**

One of the biggest problems with AI before 2025 was the **intent gap**. Humans expressed vague goals, but AIs struggled to translate them into concrete actions without micromanagement. Autonomous agents like Manus close this gap:

* **Intent Parsing**: They convert high-level commands (“optimize my logistics chain”) into detailed task lists.  
* **Cross-Tool Execution**: They use APIs, databases, and even robotic controllers to carry out those tasks.  
* **Outcome Reporting**: Instead of overwhelming humans with logs, they summarize outcomes, highlighting exceptions or unexpected events.  

This makes agents like Manus feel less like a chatbot and more like a **junior colleague** who takes responsibility for outcomes.

On Reddit’s r/Futurology, users have started threads describing Manus as *“the first AI that feels like a project manager, not a calculator.”*

**Personal Experience**

I tested an early Manus AI build on a research project. My intent was simple: “collect the latest 2025 AI benchmark papers, summarize their results, and format them into a shared document.” Normally, this would take me a weekend. Manus handled it end-to-end: pulling data from arXiv, cross-checking results on Papers With Code, generating tables, and dropping a formatted draft into Google Docs. It wasn’t perfect - I still had to polish - but it saved me 80% of the work. That’s the first time I felt like AI wasn’t just *helping* me, it was *working alongside me.*

**Famous Book Insight**

In *Life 3.0* (Max Tegmark, Chapter 5), Tegmark explores scenarios where AI transitions from tool to autonomous agent, highlighting the tension between empowerment and control. Manus AI is a concrete example of this shift: it empowers humans by taking on real-world tasks, but it also underscores the growing importance of **alignment and oversight** in autonomous systems.

# Vision-Language-Action Models for Humanoid Control

For decades, humanoid robots have struggled to live up to science fiction dreams. They could walk, maybe pick up boxes, but the moment the environment changed, they failed. The missing piece was **unified intelligence** \- the ability to connect *what robots see*, *what they’re told*, and *how they move.*

In 2025, **Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs)** are filling that gap. By combining perception (vision), reasoning (language), and embodiment (action), they enable humanoids to **understand instructions in natural language, interpret the environment visually, and translate that into real-world movement.**

**Helix Enabling Full Upper-Body Humanoid Control**

One of the most striking VLA breakthroughs is **Helix**, a model unveiled in early 2025 that controls **full humanoid upper-body dexterity.**

Key capabilities:

* **Complex Manipulation**: Helix can perform two-handed tasks like folding laundry, using tools, and assembling electronics.  
* **Instruction Following**: A user can say, “Stack those three books by size,” and the humanoid interprets the vision input (the books), reasons through the language command, and executes the action.  
* **Safety Awareness**: Helix integrates real-time feedback loops, preventing accidents like gripping too tightly or mishandling fragile objects.  

What makes Helix different from older robotics models is its **compositional reasoning**. Instead of memorizing motions, it decomposes tasks - “pick up object,” “evaluate orientation,” “place carefully” - the same way humans do.

On Reddit’s r/robotics, videos of Helix humanoids tying shoelaces and pouring drinks are drawing hundreds of thousands of upvotes, with comments like: *“This isn’t Boston Dynamics acrobatics - this is actual usefulness.”*

**Dual-System VLM + Visuomotor Approach**

Helix and similar VLAs work by integrating **two complementary systems**:

1. **Vision-Language Models (VLMs):**  
   * Interpret the environment: objects, spatial layouts, constraints.  
   * Translate human instructions into structured task goals.  
2. **Visuomotor Controllers:**  
   * Handle the physics of motion: torque, grip, and trajectory.  
   * Adapt dynamically to small errors (like dropping an object mid-task).  

This dual-system setup mirrors human cognition: our **prefrontal cortex plans actions (language)** while our **motor cortex executes them (movement).**

Benchmarks reported on **MLPerf Robotics 2025** show that VLA-driven humanoids achieve **task completion rates above 85%** in messy, real-world environments - compared to \~45% for traditional robotics models.

That’s not incremental progress - it’s the difference between robots as staged demos and robots as everyday assistants.

**Nvidia GR00T N1’s Role in Robotic Intelligence**

Nvidia’s earlier breakthrough (Isaac GR00T N1) ties directly into VLA success. GR00T N1 provides the **training base** \- massive multimodal datasets of vision + action sequences. VLAs like Helix then **fine-tune** on this data for specific humanoid control.

In practice:

* GR00T N1 supplies foundational “common sense” motor skills (grasping, balancing, carrying).  
* Helix adapts these into task-specific intelligence (tying knots, using tools).  

The synergy between foundational robotics models and task-specific VLAs is why 2025 is being called the year **robots finally gained real-world intelligence.**

On **Capterra enterprise reviews**, companies piloting humanoid VLAs in logistics centers report a **30–40% reduction in manual labor hours**, while maintaining safety standards.

**Personal Experience**

At a demo in Munich this year, I watched a humanoid running Helix VLA pour coffee into a cup, stir sugar, and hand it to an audience member. Simple on the surface, but anyone who knows robotics understands this is a holy grail. The robot adapted when the spoon slipped slightly, re-gripping it naturally without freezing or crashing. It didn’t feel like a demo - it felt like competence.

**Famous Book Insight**

In *The Body Keeps the Score* (Bessel van der Kolk, Chapter 2), van der Kolk highlights how human intelligence is not just cognitive but **embodied**, with the body and mind deeply intertwined in perception and action. VLAs embody this principle for machines: true intelligence requires **integration of vision, language, and motor control.**

# Breakthroughs in AI Visual Art and Creativity

For years, AI art tools like DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, and MidJourney sparked heated debates about originality, copyright, and creativity. In 2025, however, the conversation has shifted - not because the controversy is gone, but because the **tools themselves have evolved to the point where their outputs are indistinguishable from high-end human artistry.**

With the release of **GPT Image 1, MidJourney v7, and Imagen 4**, AI visual creativity has crossed into a new tier of **fidelity, multimodality, and creative control.** Instead of just spitting out pretty pictures, these systems can respond to **complex creative prompts that combine text, image, and even audio inputs.**

**GPT Image 1, MidJourney v7, and Imagen 4**

Three flagship tools dominate AI visual art in 2025:

1. **GPT Image 1** (OpenAI)  
   * Fully integrated into GPT-5.  
   * Can generate images not just from text but also from *conversations* \- refining images iteratively in the same chat where you brainstorm.  
   * Example: A game designer can describe a character across multiple sessions, show reference sketches, and GPT Image evolves the art consistently.  
2. **MidJourney v7**  
   * Focuses on aesthetics and surreal creativity.  
   * The v7 engine supports **photorealism indistinguishable from DSLR shots** and **illustrations with painterly depth rivaling oil masters.**  
   * Reddit’s r/MidJourney is exploding with side-by-sides where even professional artists admit they “can’t tell which one’s real.”  
3. **Imagen 4 (Google DeepMind)**  
   * Prioritizes **scientific and educational visuals**: scientific diagrams, architectural renderings, and medical illustrations.  
   * Universities are already licensing Imagen 4 for **biology and physics visualization**, replacing expensive graphic outsourcing.  

Together, these systems don’t just create images - they reshape industries from indie games to textbooks to marketing campaigns.

**Multimodal Creative Prompts**

A defining trend in 2025 is **multimodal creative prompting.** Instead of just typing text, users combine multiple inputs:

* **Text + Image**: Upload a rough sketch and describe the vibe (“make it cyberpunk neon”), and the AI outputs a finished artwork.  
* **Text + Audio**: Say aloud, “Imagine a concert poster with a thunderstorm theme,” and the system generates art influenced by your vocal tone.  
* **Iterative Refinement**: You can have a “conversation” with the artwork - tweak colors, add objects, shift styles - in real time.  

This changes the **creative workflow**: instead of painstaking iteration in Photoshop or Blender, creators can **ideate faster** and spend more time curating, directing, and polishing.

On Reddit, r/StableDiffusion and r/Art are full of posts from indie creators saying they’ve **cut concept design time from weeks to hours.**

**Higher Fidelity in Digital Artistry**

One of the harshest critiques of early AI art was its lack of **fidelity** \- mangled hands, distorted faces, nonsensical details. In 2025, these flaws are largely gone:

* **GPT Image 1** nails anatomical precision at medical-grade quality.  
* **MidJourney v7** renders light, shadow, and texture at cinema-level realism.  
* **Imagen 4** outputs schematics so precise they’re already being used in peer-reviewed journals.  

This higher fidelity has ripple effects:

* **Film and TV**: Storyboards and concept art are now AI-generated as the first draft.  
* **Advertising**: Agencies use AI to create dozens of campaign variations instantly.  
* **Education**: Textbooks now include AI-generated diagrams that update with the latest science.  

According to **Capterra reviews from design firms**, productivity in concept art pipelines has doubled, while costs have fallen by 30–50%.

**Personal Experience**

As a writer, I once spent hundreds hiring illustrators for speculative story concepts. This year, I tested GPT Image 1 by describing a character I’d imagined - “a lone traveler carrying a lantern through a flooded city at dusk.” The AI refined it across three sessions, integrating feedback about mood and architecture. By the end, the output felt like it had captured my imagination *better than my own sketches ever could.*

It didn’t replace human artistry for me - but it became the **collaborator I’d always wished for.**

**Famous Book Insight**

In *The Creative Act: A Way of Being* (Rick Rubin, Chapter 12), Rubin argues that creativity is about **removing barriers between imagination and expression.** AI visual tools in 2025 embody this - they collapse the technical gap, letting ideas flow directly into images. Instead of replacing creativity, they expand access to it.

Meanwhile, humanoids powered by **VLA models like Helix** can follow natural-language instructions, interpret their environment, and execute tasks with full dexterity - tying shoelaces, pouring drinks, or assembling parts. Nvidia’s **GR00T N1 robotics model** supplies the training backbone, making 2025 the first year robots feel competent outside of staged demos.



# Q4: Can AI now conduct scientific research independently?

**A:** Yes. The release of **AI Scientist-v2** in 2025 proved that AI can autonomously **generate hypotheses, design experiments, interpret results, and publish peer-reviewed papers.** Using **agentic tree search and vision-language feedback loops**, AI Scientist-v2 has already co-authored work in *Nature Physics* and *Science Advances.* This doesn’t mean human scientists are obsolete - it means they now have **AI collaborators that compress years of research into weeks.** On Reddit’s r/science, researchers call this “a jetpack for science.”



# Q5: What role does the UK’s Isambard-AI supercomputer play?

**A:** **Isambard-AI** is Europe’s most powerful publicly accessible AI supercomputer, running on **5,400 Nvidia GPUs.** Unlike private labs, it’s dedicated to **public-good projects** in healthcare, agriculture, and climate science. Early applications include **15% improved cancer detection accuracy** and **20% crop yield boosts under climate stress**. Importantly, Isambard-AI operates under **ethical oversight boards** and an **open access model**, ensuring universities, non-profits, and startups can benefit. It’s the clearest example yet of **AI infrastructure for society, not just for profit.**



# Final Takeaway

2025 is the year AI stopped being a futuristic buzzword and became a **living infrastructure across medicine, robotics, science, creativity, and enterprise.** From AI stethoscopes catching heart issues early, to Manus AI agents managing workflows, to humanoids powered by VLAs tying shoelaces, these breakthroughs are not theoretical. They’re happening right now.

And while questions about ethics, safety, and long-term impact remain, the trajectory is clear: **AI is no longer just about intelligence - it’s about action, embodiment, and real-world change.**

If you’ve been watching AI from the sidelines, 2025 is the year to pay attention. Because the breakthroughs we’ve covered here aren’t hype slides - they’re reshaping daily life, work, and science in real time.",1,1756772508.0,AiReviewInsider,0,1.0,False

""Please chief, I'm sure I can just issue a public apology and it'll be fixed, can't I?""

""Miss Garcia..."" the police chief turned around and sighed. She was desperate, there was no way she could be transferred to the *department of complex cases*. What might sound like a very interesting career development was actually a stain threatening her very promising cv. This place was where cases went to go cold and remain unsolved forever. Subsequently most detectives being transfered here were facing their career end. 

""I'm not repeating myself. This is my final word.""

After collecting herself she stepped out into the busy air streets of the city. As always it was raining, and her neural implant didn't even bother to try to filter it. She took an aerial cap and drove down towards level 12 where the department was located. Three more levels down and they would be in the crime controlled underworld of the city. Considering no one from down there seemed to bother about a police department being so close just went to show how insignificant this department was.

When Valeria had found her way towards her new office she entered and saw a man about her age sitting behind the desk. The office was incredibly messy, with case files all over the place, old coffee cups, and a dead plant in the corner. His apperance, while in line with the departments guidelines, was equally messy. 

""Oh, hi! You're the new one, detective Garcia right? So what did you do that they sent you down here? Doesn't matter really, you might be in luck since for the first time we got a case that could be actually interesting!""

[OOO]

Hi there! Hope you've enjoyed this little introduction. My idea is simple in essence (and strongly inspired by the x-files): a promising detective is demoted to a department that is usually not that interesting, only to be involved in a complex case that'll have a lot of twists and turns. 

All that in a city of the future, inspired by blade runner, ghost in the shell, and cyberpunk. The city and setting will be a big part of the plot of course, and I'd love to build it together with you :)

Three days ago I crashed my car and I don’t really know what to do. I’ve been handling everything on my own and I’m starting to feel a little over my head.

Basically, I was in Toronto at like 3am after working a 12-hour shift and I was planning to stay the night at my friend’s. My mom suddenly started calling and pressuring me to come home. The train home wasn’t available at that time and before I got into my car I looked at getting an uber but it was $150 and I just paid my car insurance and didn’t have enough. I told her I was too tired but she kept pushing, so I got in the car. I tried to make it, grabbed a coffee, but I ended up nodding off on the highway going about 114km/h and swerved into the median. Side airbags went off, my ear was ringing, but I walked away okay. Thank god I didn’t hit anyone.

The cops showed up, were honestly really nice, took the report, asked if I wanted to warm up in their car until the tow came. I just blurted the truth right away, said I fell asleep, it was my fault. They asked if I wanted EMS and I said no, and the toll truck guy picked me up and I asked him not to drop it off at my house and he agreed but said he wanted to take me home. I asked him if he could drop me off 2 blocks away from my house so my mom wouldn’t see the car, he agreed. When I got in my mom was shouting at me and yelling and I didn’t want to tell her, but I told her what happened and she said “great, you destroyed your car how brilliant” and went to sleep. I brushed my teeth and went to bed. The day after my mom asked me what I told the cop and I told her I told him the truth and she called me an idiot for not lying and saying “your tire blew.” That kinda messed with my head because I thought being honest was the right thing.

Now I’m stuck in insurance hell:
Tow + storage fees were already ~$600 but apparently insurance covers that.

I do have collision coverage. I had to call and open the claim myself. They said I need to strip my plates and grab my stuff, then they’ll move the car to one of their shops Wednesday.
Deductible is $2,000 (I had to google what that even meant).

Rental car is covered somewhat but Enterprise told me deposit is $50–200 plus $0.25/km. Insurance wasn’t super clear on what exactly is covered.
Car is a 2015 Civic. Side airbag went off, side damage. I’m bracing for them to just total it.
All of this would be annoying enough, but I also have a concussion. I walked to the doctor this morning and he said it’s “minor,” but my head rings, I’m light sensitive, get headaches. And meanwhile I’ve been on the phone with insurance people, tow companies, rental people. It’s exhausting.

To top it off, my university classes start Wednesday. I need to move my stuff to London this week and I don’t even know if I should take the rental that far or just wait.

My mom hasn’t helped at all — she just told me “maybe this knocked some sense into you.” So it’s been me figuring this out. My dad’s been away on a business trip and doesn’t know. Honestly I don’t want to tell him because it’s embarrassing and he’s stressed enough. I also feel guilty as hell for crashing the car he bought me as a graduation present, I feel like shit. I can pay the deductible out of savings I put aside for school. Like I’d rather figure this out, and pay the deductible and tell him when he gets back and it’s all cleaned up. My dad’s not the yelling type, he’s just reserved and quiet, but I feel like I piece of shit for listening to my mom while knowing I was too tired and crashing the car. (My parents are divorced and hate each other just to add context)


Questions:
Should I tell my dad, or just keep dealing with it myself? If you were a parent, would you want to know?
Do you think insurance will cover the damages or just write it off as a total loss?
Am I being dumb for not resting more with the concussion?
If they total the car, do they pay me pre-crash market value, or post-crash “wreck value”?

I'm mainly having trouble keeping the rubber soles of them clean. The rubber holds on to the stains so badly! There are black scuff marks and some dark brown/yellow staining (probably coffee 😅), especially bad on the heel of one of the shoes. 

So far, I've tried Magic Eraser, dish soap, and Peroxi like I did on the leather part, which worked really well for the leather. And I was scrubbing with a toothbrush, for anyone wondering. 

What's the next step? Tide pen? Diluted bleach? I'm also hoping to lighten up the stiching as well. All the stitching was white, but it all looks brown now.

One for the house when power goes out and we recently picked up the Predator 5000 inverter generator for camping with our 26 -foot travel trailer.

Been very happy with it (only used it twice so far) and it’s very quiet, compact and portable. It is a beast to lift by myself, but with my wife’s help, no problem.

My question is about the remote start/stop key fob. I have relied on my BIL who has had generators and camped for 25+ years and he highly recommends when stopping the generator to go out to the generator unplug the cable first and shut it down by turning off the on/off switch and he also turns the gas line off.  This might be more of a habit for him but I’m guessing the technology nowadays would allow you to keep the cable attached and the generator in the on position while camping (off-grid) to be able to utilize the remote start/stop key fob device. Otherwise, what is the point of the remote key fob.

I do keep the generator turned off and the gas line off when not using for extended periods or when in storage, but looking for, reassurances I guess, or confirmation that I can leave it in the on position and cable attached while camping .

It would sure be convenient to NOT have to get dressed to go outside and turn it on just to run the coffee pot and microwave in the morning. 😀

1n64s63,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkinitalian/comments/1n64s63/how_to_say_right_away_with_subito_in_italian/,"How to say ""right away"" with ""subito"" in Italian","**""Subito"" in Italian: My Journey with Students**

Hey everyone! I've been teaching Italian for a while now, and one of the words that always gets my students excited (and sometimes a bit confused) is _subito_. It's one of those words that you'll hear **everywhere** in Italy, and trust me, once you start using it, there's no turning back!

**Understanding ""subito""**

So, here's the scoop. _Subito_ is an adverb that means ""right away"" or ""immediately"". It's like the Italian version of a superhero, swooping in to save the day with its sense of **urgency** and **efficiency**. Whether you're in a café or at a business meeting, _subito_ is your go-to word for getting things done pronto.

**Real-life scenarios**

I often tell my students about how my mom used to tell me, _""Fallo subito!""_ (do it immediately) when I was a kid. Let's just say I wasn't the tidiest daughter around!

**Politeness and enthusiasm**

But wait, there's more! _Subito_ isn't just about speed; it's also about showing **politeness** and **enthusiasm**. Imagine you're at a restaurant, and you ask for a coffee. The waiter responds with a cheerful _""Subito!""_ It's like they're saying, ""I've got your back!""

**Using ""subito dopo""**

And then there's _subito dopo_, which means ""right after."" It's perfect for storytelling or planning. Picture this: ""We'll go dancing _subito dopo cena_"" (right after dinner). It's all about keeping things in order, like a well-organized sock drawer.

So, have you ever used _subito_ in a fun or unexpected way? Share your stories in the comments!

I'm hoping a lot of this still holds. Good luck! 💕✨ (I graduated in 2023, for context)

**Classes**

1. Show up, even when you don’t quite feel like it. Netflix will always be there and you’ll have done more than those who chose not to show up.
2. Make class friends. These are the people you will reach out to for notes if you are absent one day. Bonus points if they’re in your graduating class and major. Even more bonus points if you hang out outside of class. Also! Professors do not always publish their notes on Canvas— either before/after class or at all. Class friends can come in clutch if you miss a day.
3. If you are mentally unwell and cannot go to class, I recommend a day of self-care and texting your support system. If you are at all unsafe, text 988. That is the mental health crisis hotline. 
4. Take notes in the way that helps you best. I hand wrote all of mine in a physical notebook because I wanted the muscle memory of writing things down, but I’m old school that way.
5. Participate. Sometimes it is part of your grade. For me, it helped me solidify knowledge and refresh my memory.
6. Take classes at the times that work best for YOU. If you’re not an early morning person and you can take a required class later in the day, do that. If you need to take a class that is only offered in the early morning, grab a coffee from the Grind and push through. You got this.
7. Be a good student to your professors. They can and will serve as networking connections as you go through school, and are mostly good-hearted people working in a complicated system. 
8. On the first day of classes, feel free to introduce yourself to your professors. I had to do that to start the conversation about my academic accommodations (which we can talk about later), but it builds rapport, especially if you participate and really put in the effort.
9. Make sure you are able to walk from building/class to building/class in a decent time frame. The class selector software you use during Orientation will give you warnings if it believes two consecutive classes are too far apart to be on time for. I recommend walking the distance and timing yourself. Is it corny? Maybe. But will you become more familiar with the campus layout and how long it’ll take you to get from one place to another across campus? Definitely.
10. Take an elective/class outside your major early on. See what other programs at UWM have to offer via their classes. You may develop a niche interest. It’s good to expand your horizons, even if your initial interest in the subject is small. Your interest may not grow any bigger than it is, but it’s worth trying rather than shutting out the option completely. 

**Extracurriculars/Involvement**

1. Clubs and events (as well as professors) are vital for building your social community and professional networking opportunities— try some out! Student Involvement fairs are put on by different groups that span broad interests across campus.
2. If you stumble upon an event being held in the Union concourse/Spaights Plaza, check it out! You don’t have to commit to literally anything if you don’t want to, but indulge your curiosity and see what happens!
3. If you’re unsure where to start in finding clubs to join, see if there is a club aligned with political affiliation (if you have one), religious participation (if you participate with one), your career goals, your hobbies, interests, etc.
4. Some professors oversee clubs and groups as faculty advisors. They may advertise their club/group in class and if you’re interested, give them a try.
5. Look around you— people post flyers and posters all around campus advertising clubs, groups, and even new classes you may be interested in trying.
6. You will get this shoved in your face over and over, but if there’s an undergraduate research project you want to be involved in, I recommend doing what you can to participate. I never participated because none of the projects ever interested me, but who knows what you’ll find!
7. I know next to nothing about UWM Greek life. If there’s a sorority that you’re interested in, talk to them and get to know the sisters and their mission!
8. UWM has numerous D1 sports and club sports— give them a try!
9. Go to homecoming at least once. 
10. If there are tables set up along the Union and they’re a cause you follow, feel free to write down your school email to get on their email list! Unsubscribing is easy as a click, and you’ll be one of the first to know about upcoming events.

**Academic Advisors**

1. I recommend meeting with your advisor at least TWICE a semester. Once at the beginning, and once at the end. You want to build rapport with these people. They’re the one guiding your success plan! At the first meeting, you set the lay of the land for what the semester will look like and you can talk through any challenges or fears you may have that they can help with. At the second meeting, you can talk about what was most effective and what needs to happen for the next semester to go smoothly. 
2. Know where their office is, and what building it’s in. My advisor worked between two buildings throughout the week, so knowing which building she was in helped me orient my time/schedule effectively.
3. Don’t be afraid to tell them about any academic issues you’re having. They can help! You never know until you ask.
4. It is possible to switch advisors, but I only recommend doing this IF you have tried working out the issues you have with your current counselor to the best of your ability.
5. Advisors know about minors and certificates you can receive within your major, so ask them about those minors and certificates if you’re interested!
6. I recommend keeping a paper/digital copy of your academic plan on hand so you know which classes to sign up for, when.
7. Advisors also know what you need to do in order to meet prerequisites for a class— ask them and they will get you on the right track. 
8. If you want to change your major, tell your advisor and they will get you on the path you’re changing to.
9. Don’t throw problems in your advisor’s lap without possible solutions or ideas to get the ball rolling.
10. If your advisor asks you to meet them halfway when it comes to accomplishing something between you two (such as advocating for yourself with a professor), do the thing. Help them and they will help you.

**Adult Things**

1. Do NOT accept a drink from anybody that you did not see get poured into a cup. You cannot detect roofies by taste. 
2. When out and about— cover your drinks with your hand. You don’t know what kind of weirdos are out there. They will roofie your drink.
3. Know the signs of a drug overdose. Just because certain drugs are illegal, doesn’t mean people won’t take them. Best to be prepared for anything.
4. Know where within Sandburg you can access Naloxone (Narcan) kits. These save people from dying of a drug overdose. Know how to use Narcan!
5. Use condoms when you have sex. If a guy gives you an excuse (he can’t fit, they hurt, etc), that’s a HUGE red flag. Do not give in. They’re lies used to manipulate you into possibly getting pregnant. Stay safe.
6. If you’re sexually active, get tested for STDs. And regularly. I think you can get them at the Student Wellness Center AKA Norris Health Center. I don’t know how much they cost, if anything, but BE SAFE. There is also a local Planned Parenthood where you can get them done.
7. Know how to use the morning-after pill/Plan B if a condom breaks.
8. Know where to get the morning-after pill/Plan B.
9. Know where to get condoms (the Women’s Resource Center, The LGBTQ+ Resource Center, even me!)
10. IF YOU GET PREGNANT, do NOT leave a digital trail. No DMs, no texts, nothing. In-person conversations with trusted people ONLY. Social media will rat you out. Cell phone companies can, have been, and will continue to be subpoenaed for peoples’ text records. Keep it away from technology.

**Dorm Living/Campus Safety**

1. Keep your living space clean. Clean your living space if you have some downtime.  Even if it’s just putting dirty laundry in its place or organizing your shower tote, you’ll thank yourself when you come back to your dorm exhausted, or finish a study session and can only think of getting into your warm, comfy bed.
2. Do not engage the abortion protesters. They are doing things exactly by the extreme pro-life zealot playbook. They want you to get angry. Do not give them what they want.
3. There’s a guy who stands outside the Gold Meir Library and hands out pens. He attaches religious scripture to them, which I always threw out. He’s pretty harmless, I’ve never stuck around to talk to him, but if you’re in a pinch for pens and you see him, take a pair!
4. Get involved in dorm activities! If Sandburg/Cambridge is hosting an event, I highly encourage you to go to it. You’ll meet new people there, it’ll keep you busy, and who knows? You might have fun. 
5. I have never used the BOSS (Be On \[the\] Safe Side), but know it’s a good tool to use if you need to travel across \*longer\* distances at night around campus. 
6. If you need to walk somewhere across campus at night and you don’t feel safe, you can use the RAVE Guardian (RG) app as a virtual safe-walking companion. I don’t know if there are human SAFE walkers still, but you can ask the UWM police.
7. On the same note, use the RAVE Guardian app to get updates about potential issues across campus. Sometimes students can be victims of armed robberies, and they will tell you via text, email, and the RG app. Stay. Safe.
8. Keep your bathroom clean. You share it with at least three other people, am I right? Take care of your stuff and always wash your leg/armpit hairs down the drain. Do not leave them in the shower for your suite mates to find. That is bad room-sharing etiquette. 
9. If your roommate becomes a problem (not respecting your boundaries, stuff, schedule, etc), you can request a new roommate, BUT. I recommend trying to work things out with them first and talking to your RA. That is part of why your RAs are there. 
10. Vehicles have sped through campus streets without regard for pedestrians. I have endured it, and you must be aware of what’s happening around you at all times. 
11. Cops are a reactionary force within the criminal justice system. You MUST protect yourself preemptively. Knives and guns are not allowed in school buildings, but other tools exist for your protection. Get one, especially if you’ll be having late nights studying outside your dorm. You cannot control people victimizing other people, but you have some control of lessening your risk to be victimized.
12. Hide your valuables. Always know where your backpack, laptop, books, phone, chargers, and whatever else you deem valuable are. Apple AirTags and Tile Tags (Amazon) help you keep track of items via GPS on your phone. Consider investing in some if that is of interest to you.

**Dealing with/the UWM Police**

1. The UWM police are separate from the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD), but they will collaborate especially on larger cases and more imminent threats. 
2. Know where the UWM PD headquarters are. Hint: the Northwest Quadrant, Building D. First floor.
3. If the police search your room, they are not allowed to search any of YOUR PERSONAL belongings UNLESS you give consent. There is a legitimate exception for consent found in policing. (I literally majored in this. Sorta.) They are allowed AT ALL TIMES, however, to search university property. The desks in the dorms? Belongs to the university. They can search those. The built in closets? Don’t leave your drugs/paraphernalia there. That is university property. Your great-grandmother’s unassuming jewelry box? They need consent. Your free-standing shelf of drawers? Consent.
4. As a word of caution, do not let the cops in. Ever. If there are drugs/illegal things out on the desk/coffee table/whatever, they are given what is known as a plain-view exception to confiscate and charge you with a possession crime (at the very least, probably). Do not let them in, especially if you or your roommate leave that stuff lying around.
5. If you say that the cops are not allowed to come into your dorm, but your roommate grants them permission, the cops are allowed to come in. You and your roommate must be on a consensus of saying “NO” if you want to keep the cops out. I don’t like letting cops into my house, so if you feel different then disregard this.
6. Feel free to go to Coffee with a Cop and just talk to them! Build some rapport with them, get their perspective on the job, and ask them any and all burning questions you have. I feel some ways about cops but it’s better to know about who’s supposed to protect you, rather than a preconceived notion of them.",7,1756771116.0,UWMilwaukee,0,1.0,False

I’m 26, 5’10, with an average/dad bod build. Based in London. I work out 3–4 times a week, love coffee, music, films, shows, and I work in IT. I’d say I’m a bit nerdy, career-focused, and grounded.

I’m looking for a long-term relationship, not just something casual. While there’s of course a sexual undertone to this, I want to build something meaningful and lasting. I don’t intend to give up my responsibilities as a man but I want to share my life with someone dominant, who enjoys both the sweet and the possessive sides of a dynamic.

As a Muslim, I believe we should think in terms of longevity. I don’t see myself rushing into marriage, ideally I’d want at least a year to truly know each other, unless things progress naturally. I’d like to take time to build a foundation, but I’m open to discussion on timelines.

I don’t intend to keep things online forever. After some texting, I’d want to meet in person maybe for coffee, something casual but real.

What I’m Attracted To:

I’m insanely drawn to affectionate, possessive, and obsessive women; the kind who want to blow up my phone, demand pictures, use me whenever they want, and crave me. I love clinginess, obsession, and intensity, mixed with sweetness: holding my face, kissing my cheeks, being both perverted and loving. 

That balance is what drives me.
As a submissive, I don’t just “bottom” I enjoy giving as much as receiving, and I’m very open to exploring.

Kinks & Interests:

CNC
Bondage
Body kissing / worship
Edging, orgasm control/denial
Overstimulation / post-orgasm torture
Forced or ruined orgasms
Giving oral, dry humping
Pegging / anal play (including strap-on sucking)
Spanking, gags, blindfolds
Exhibitionism
Gentle femdom, mommy domme dynamics
Praise & degradation, neck kisses, making out, nipple play

Limits:

Cuckolding, extreme ballbusting, knives/cuts/needles, scat, piss, forced bi.

Who I’m Looking For:

22–29 years old
Any height / background
Based in London or able to travel
Career-minded / professional aspirations
Naturally dominant (sexually or otherwise)
Serious about a long-term relationship
If this speaks to you, please introduce yourself properly, tell me a bit about you so I know you’re genuine. I can share face pics and would appreciate a pic (SFW) in return.",1,1756770954.0,flrdating,0,1.0,False

The audit is run. I've restocked our guest store. And the coffee is made. Now it's just counting down the last two hours with almost nothing to do before the next shift comes in and I can go home. Then the phone rings.

A guest wants to know where the sifter in the room is. I don't understand what he means, and he says he's gonna make cookies for his kids, but he needs a sifter to mix the dry ingredients. Now I know what he means. I tell him that the rooms don't have those, but I can check with the breakfast attendant when he gets there in the next few minutes, and if they have one, he can bring his ingredients down and we can mix them for him really quickly. He doesn't like the idea of waiting but he says okay. And he hangs up.

Maybe it was me being tired from being awake all night, but my mind suddenly clicks and I call him back immediately and confirm that he was going to bake cookies and well...

Me: Sir, you said you were making cookies?

Guest: Yes.

Me: May I ask where you're going to bake them?

Guest: In the oven.

(All our rooms have kitchenettes)

Me: Sir, there's no oven in the room.

Guest: Sure there is. It's under the counter next to the sink.

(Now I'm thinking, oh dear God no.)

Me: Sir, that's a dishwasher.

Guest: WHAT!?!

The wall between the living and the dead was filled with cracks and holes. The builders did the best they could, but it was required to span across the fabric of space and time itself. Flaws and crevices were to be expected. They didn’t appreciate people coming and vandalizing it, but there was nothing to be done. There was all the money in the world for constructing large projects, but there was no money for their maintenance. And don’t get them started on the coffee budget.

On one side of the wall, the dead bustled to see the world of the living. Their desire for love hadn’t been fulfilled, their lives never found their purposes, and their neighbors never gave them back their lawnmowers. They hungered for the existence they once had that would be denied to them. The living mostly ignored the wall as they preferred not to think about their inevitable crossing. Some did approach it without caution. These were the people who held seances.

Jim, Frida, and Reid sat around a circle made of flour. They wanted salt, but Shannon had high-blood pressure. She was also on a low sugar diet. As such, the three hoped the ghosts were bread aficionados. They couldn’t find candles so they placed three lamps in a circle and plugged them into Frida. She adjusted the amount of power until it was sufficiently dim. In the middle of the circle, Jim had attempted to carve the alphabet. They didn’t bring chalk, and Jim was semiliterate. The result would be viewed as a sign of a curse long after the exorcism. 

“So what do we do now?” Reid was sitting the furthest from the circle because his sweat was ruining the circle. 

“Shh.” Jim closed his eyes. A small part of Reid considered punching Jim for this indiscretion, but the uncertainty overwhelmed him. The supernatural was the only thing that could break Reid’s ego. It was a true miracle.

“Uhmmmmmm, uhmmmm.” Jim repeated these chants to enter a state that would connect him to the spirit realm. “Spirits from beyond. Make your presence known. Tell us why you walk the Earth.”

The room was still. Jim and Frida waited for a reaction, but the world stayed silent. 

“I beg you to communicate with us. Pierce the veil between living and dead. I am your conduit,” Jim said. There was no change in the room. The dead stayed quiet.

“What do I smell or something?” Jim asked. Reid twitched and jerked dramatically. His eyes rolled back in his head. A gravelly voice emerged from his lips.

“Yes,” it said. Frida gasped, causing the lights to flicker. Reid’s eyes returned to normal, and he panted.

“Oh my god, what happened. It felt like I just fell into a cold tub of water,” Reid said. Jim closed his eyes.

“Spirits, I offer my friend as a conduit for communication,” Jim said.

“Wait, I didn’t agree with this,” Reid said. His whole body shook. His arms flailed wildly. Books floated and spun around the three of them. Ghosts had to make an entrance.

“What do you want?” Reid asked with his eyes rolled back and his voice lower.

“First, may I ask the name of whom I am talking to?”

“You may not. We don’t share that with weirdos.”


“Okay.” Jim’s eyes darted back and forth. “I am speaking to one ghost or many.”

“We are many, and we are one. We are all who came before, and all who will be,” the ghosts said.

“So at least three of you,” Jim muttered. Frida watched this conversation enraptured.

“Oh spirits, why do you choose to torment Shannon?” Jim asked.

“She bought this house knowing it was haunted. It’s her own fault.” 

“Yes, but why do you do it? What harm befell you in life? Why were you denied a peaceful rest?” The ghosts were quiet for several reasons.

“Nothing bad happened. We are just bored.”

“Wait, that’s it,” Jim blinked.

“Must there be a deeper reason for our actions?”

“Well, I kind of expected there to be one. I was going to help you find peace.”

“We have observed you over the past few days.” Reid’s face was twisted into a smile. “You would be horrible at helping us resolve their traumas.”

Reid’s body shook, and the ghosts left his body. The lamps overloaded and shattered. The flour was blown away. Reid gasped.

“What happened?” Reid asked.

“Nothing,” Jim wept. “Absolutely nothing.”

TLDR: 
Outdoorsy heart, geeky brain, animal lover. 🎮🖼️
Thoughtful, caring, and ready for someone loving, funny, and full of life.
Make me laugh, beat me at Halo (if you can), and let’s see where it goes.

The Long Version:
I’m someone who believes the best relationships are built on laughter, kindness, and genuine connection. Friends would describe me as thoughtful, caring, and the kind of person who remembers the little things. I love the outdoors, whether it’s a peaceful hike, a day at the park, or just watching the sunset.

When I’m not outside, you might find me exploring my love for computers and video games, visiting a museum, or appreciating art in all its forms. Animals hold a special place in my heart, and I’m happiest when I’m sharing life with a fellow good-spirited soul.

What I’m Looking For
I’m hoping to meet someone loving, funny, and full of life, someone who’s up for adventures big and small, from deep conversations over coffee to spontaneous weekend getaways. A good heart and a great sense of humor are always welcome here.

If you’re looking for a partner who will listen, laugh, and grow with you, I’d love to hear from you.

1n64f43,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureretention/comments/1n64f43/what_leads_to_urges/,What Leads to Urges?,"Like many of you, I have been battling with urges for years, not always winning...  
Sometimes on a long streak, I would thought myself immune to them, then, out of nowhere, the biggest urge would come and possess my entire being. This lead me to analyze the origin of urges and these are, in my opinion, their major cause:

**Fluid Build-up**

The primary cause of urges is simply the pressing of fluids against the seminal vesicals and prostate. If we have the habit of releasing every 2-3 days, these glands will work hard to supply for our “matting” rhythm. These fluids are also backed by strong sexual energy. When starting SR, it’s logical to gradually increase the interval at which we release so as to habituate the body to our new rhythm.

**Sensory Stimulation**

Anything sexually arousing has the potential to trigger an urge, but in my opinion, purposefully looking at content or fantasizing is far more dangerous than walking onto a beach. Sometimes, our biology pushes us toward crowded environment just to kind of look for potential mates. We scan women’s body, we interact (or not) and we may get a little aroused. Desire for the opposite sex can be strong, but in my opinion, a pure mindset makes this instinctual reality very manageable. Though, we don’t want to be hanging out in front of nightclub every night just to look who’s there... Constant flooding with objects of desire would inevitably weakens one’s will.

I would like to add that overstimulation of any kind can also induce urges. Arousal is a nervous state that apply not only to sexuality. Constant music, noise and screens irritate the nervous system and make it impossible to reflect and relax. Spices, coffee and certain foods also can trigger sexual stimulation. My last point is up for debate, but I would argue that a lot of things we do to “transmute” can too work against us. Excessive exercise or activities of any kind really can leave us jittery and vulnerable. Balance is key.  
  
**Emotions**  
  
Emotions, mostly the unpleasant ones, are a huge cause of urges for many of us. This is because we learn early to use sexuality as a coping mechanism for our emotions. Though, the heavy hitter here is porn. Masturbation alone is mostly use to relieve tension or irritability, but porn offer the perfect escape for all other “negative” emotions: guilt, shame, sadness, jealousy, melancholy, etc. If one never learn to be with these unpleasant and heavy emotions, the urge to escape will be too strong. The secret is to become resilient to more and more of the unpleasantness of life. It all passes... Break-ups, loss, illness and conflicts are all major tests of fortitude.  
  
**Circumstances**  
  
The last cause of urges in my opinion are simply circumstances. There are times when the circumstances save us from a relapse and others when it precipitates it .A house full of people, per example, can prevent us from acting out, but people unexpectedly leaving can amplify a latent urge.  
Letdowns of any kind can be a trigger. They frustrate us (generate negative emotions) plus they let us faced with nothing to do. It’s always good to have a plan B and be ready for letdowns.  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
An urge is usually backed by many causes. It’s manageable to have full balls when the mind is pure and the senses are quiet. It’s another story to have full balls after a weekend dancing salsa and with the stomach full of spicy tacos and coffee. Causes stack themselves and the urge get stronger. In this process, the mind is always the one offering the idea. Catching the mind’s tricks is therefore our best defence, but in the meantime we can reduce stimulation, learn to be with our emotions and manage circumstances. Best luck to you all and don’t beat yourself up if you fail sometimes!

I am no longer attracted to my husband, feel like we have been in the “roommate” stage of our relationship for around a year now, and that we don’t have really any common interests anymore since we’re different people now than when we first were together in our twenties. He doesn’t seem to make much of an effort anymore when it comes to his physical appearance in terms of regular haircuts and self-grooming and feels like he doesn’t always prioritize how he looks when he is around me like he used to even though I still make an effort.

He doesn’t seem to enjoy having new experiences together and quality time for us together was watching television, which was not enjoyable for me.

He recently got laid off from work and was in the middle of job searching which has been stressful for both of us. Even though I am an equal contributor to our combined income, he frequently gatekeeps our shared finances and makes me feel guilty when I spend money (like to go out to eat with a friend or get coffee or even for necessary medical expenses for myself).

He does make it a priority to get out of the house to go to the gym 3-4 times per week where I am stuck with our infant for those 2 hours that he is gone. When I have asked for a situation where I have equal time for myself apart from our newborn he got upset with me and the compromise was me having one day a week away for 2 hours. I was not allotted a similar amount of time or days of the week which made me feel incredibly weird about things. 

I frequently feel like I am cleaning up after both him and our kids and oftentimes feel like he is a third child. Instead of looking around the house to see what needs to be done he  asks me. It puts a lot of the mental load of our house and kids on me which is incredibly exhausting. I am also for the most part in charge of caring for our six month old infant and he rarely offers to help with things like putting her down for bed or helping with nighttime feedings so that I can also get some sleep at night. 

It feels like our interactions are generally about the kids and our to do lists and whenever he talks about other things it feels like he is always complaining and is focusing on the negative things which is hard to be around.

We’ve done multiple rounds of marriage counseling all to the same end where things improve for a short period of time only for things to return to “normal” after a few months. When I recently told my husband that I was thinking about a separation he said that he didn’t feel the same way about things and that he was caught off guard by me even bringing it up or going there.

I feel bad for wanting a separation when our kids are so young, but I also feel like I want to be in a relationship with someone who will appreciate me and will want to enjoy life while we are still in our prime. I feel like I still have so much more to offer besides being a parent and want to be with someone who feels similarly.  

TLDR: AIO by wanting to separate from my partner? I’m not attracted to him anymore, we feel like roommates, we don’t have much in common anymore, he doesn’t prioritize his physical appearance like he used to, he is controlling about our finances, he doesn’t equally contribute with helping with things around the house and our kids, and he is frequently negative when we talk about things other than our kids or work (which is pretty much all we talk about together anymore).

Finally tested negative multiple times. The final combo was doxy then azithromycin then minocycline.

Hey guys, this is a message to not give up and not lose hope. I first contracted this disease in July of 2023. I had burning and itching, and had a fever for a few days. Planned Parenthood was stumped, their tests were showing negative for the ""big 4"" and they gave me a generic antibiotic and sent me on my way. Symptoms calmed for a while.

October I had burning while urinating. went to my primary care doctor and they tested me again and found nothing. Told me to stop drinking coffee and sent me with some generic abx (I forget which kind)

Symptoms came back. Finally in February of 2024 I tested positive for mgen at an urgent care. They gave me doxycycline or azithromycin, I forget which. Not both. Obviously not the correct treatment.

In July of 2024 the infection was the worst it had ever been. I was tired, my skin and hair were frail, I had lots of anxiety and light headedness. Went to a different urgent care and they sent me doxy/azithro but didn't tell me to take them in order. I took them at the same time. This probably screwed up the treatment entirely, but I had no idea.

Regardless, I tested negative with a urologist in August of 2024. Little did I know that this was a CULTURE which is not as reliable as a PCR or NAAT test. Thinking I was cured, I wondered why I felt weak and sick at times all winter and spring.

April 2025 I thought maybe the infection was still lingering. I was getting dizzy like I had the previous year. Weak and anxious all the time. Tested again, POSITIVE.

Did doxy and azithromycin again just as a long shot.

May 2025 positive again.

I was afraid to take moxy due to potential side effects, so I ordered minocycline online. I tried for a couple days and realized I wouldn't be able to function due to the vertigo and brain fog, and I was going on a big trip so I stopped temporarily.

July I decided to take the rest of the minocycline, but wanted an extra layer of security in case I couldn't finish the whole course.

Did 7 days doxycycline, 3 days azithromycin, then did as much minocycline as I could handle. The guideline is 14 days, but the side effects were unbearable after 6 days. I could barely walk, talk, or think, I was just so groggy and my joints + muscles were tightening up, I believe this is called drug-induced lupus. I stopped after just 6 days out of the recommended 14.

Anyway, went back to the same urologist, got a negative result, but this is from a urine culture, which is frequently a source of false negatives. Cut ties with this doc as I could no longer trust them.

Urgent care results from a PCR/NAAT test 4 weeks and 6 weeks after the antibiotics - NEGATIVE. I still have some pelvic floor tightness but this can coexist without the bacterial infection. See the pinned posts for more info here.

This is not medical advice, you should follow what the CDC or what the experts recommend. But this is a call to RESEARCH and ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF. Ask questions, be skeptical. A lot of docs are clueless and will just give you a generic answer that they Googled. And don't give up! I was cured by a random combination, and while I don't recommend it exactly, it's proof that sometimes you will just get lucky and things will work out.

Mod would make me feel less worse while being productive but then sometimes it would cause sleepless nights + the long term effects of it are understudied made me feel hesitant.

so about 3 months ago after feeling super wired and crashing + getting sick for a week, i decided to go off of it and thankfully haven't felt a strong urge to use it. I think generally the 3-4 things that have worked best are:  
\- getting good sleep as much as possible

\- For level energy through out the day, I switched from coffee to drinking yerba mate traditional way with bombilla. it has given me more even energy through out the day + i like the ritual

\- for things I am really putting off that i hate doing (manual computer work or tedious debugging that can drag on for days), i just decided to either outsource it on upwork or ask for more help from colleagues when i feel stuck and that seems to work better

After my initial appointment with a clinician, I was prescribed 30mg to be taken daily for 2 weeks then 50mg for a further 2 weeks and a review in the form of a telephone call after that.

I am going on holiday today so it was agreed that I would start taking the medication regularly when I get back on the 10th, but I decided to trial a 30mg dose yesterday while I had work to see how it affected me.

I am also prescribed 40mg fluoxetine daily and I took the elvanse on an empty stomach, followed by breakfast and fluoxetine. I had a cup of coffee with my breakfast as well as when I arrived at work.

When the elvanse started to take effect I could tell, as I was laser focused on my tasks while listening to music. However, a couple of hours later I started to feel very lethargic, and I didn’t have any appetite suppression which is one of the most common side effects, I ate my lunch without issue at 12:30pm which was meant to be the peak effects as I took the elvanse at 7am. After I had my lunch, I was reading a book for the remainder of my lunch break and I could focus on the book but it was like my eyes were forcefully being closed, I did not feel stimulated at all.

Later in the day I got even more tired and I’m pretty sure I started falling asleep and getting minor hallucinations and delusions such as seeing a black stick man running across my computer screen and thinking there was someone next to me when there wasn’t. These effects concerned me but I believe it was more due to the sleep deprivation than the medication as I am now aware it is more effective if you get proper sleep.

So my question is, when I start taking elvanse regularly, assuming I try get 7-8 hours of sleep every night from then on, will I still keep feeling drowsy or will that side effect fade and I will start to feel more stimulated as my body adjusts to the medication?",2,1756769683.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False

""Elaine."" She said, as Elaine opened the door, but Elaine refused to *see* her face.

""Mrs. Infinity."" 

""You can call me Claire now dear, I'm not your kindergarten teacher any longer, nor your kid's school teacher, today.""

""Claire,"" the first name felt awkward in her mouth; calling the most famous super on the planet - and pretty much everyone's kindergarten teacher - by her first name felt... rude, but Elaine continued. ""Why are you here?""

Mrs Infinity had done this enough times to know it was better to not beat around the bush too much. ""Did you know that Henry has powers?""

Elaine scoffed, ""I hardly think making his fingertips glow counts as powers in this world. There's folks with laser eyes and time stopping powers, and an infinite number of you.""

Mrs Infinity sighed, ""If that's all he could do, then I'd agree with you.""

She shimmered off another copy of herself that said, ""Sorry, gotta go rescue a cat in a tree a few blocks away.""

""Oh lord."" Elaine said, but then she took a moment to realize who she was talking to, and how concerned her face looked. ""Wait, is Henry safe? Is he Okay? What did he do?""

""He may live. It's touch and go right now. He's in Super Hospital getting put back together by a team of the finest super doctors around.""

Elaine dropped to her knees, and started crying. 

""Nope, we're not there yet Elaine, he's still alive, and he'll need you to be strong for him, *when* he makes it."" Mrs Infinity split another two copies of herself off and they scooped Elaine up from under her armpits, while the initial one continued talking. ""We're going to drive to Super Hospital. I'll drive while we sit in the back to comfort you, but you need to know what a hero your boy has been, and you're going to need to be there for him afterward.""

Elaine tried to keep it together as they walked to the fancy black car out front, where two Infinities shuffled her into the back seat, and another took the driver's seat. As they left the neighborhood there was a Mrs Infinity coming down a ladder with a cat in her arms. 

""So Henry has been moonlighting as a hero. It isn't uncommon for kids his age with powers."" The Infinity that was driving said, ""His powers are a whole heck of a lot more than just making his fingertips glowing. He can shoot lasers too, Elaine, only from his fingers not his eyes. Far more useful than eye lasers.""

""Oh, really?""

""Yes, only he got mixed up in something way over his head. Henry uncovered a plot to use some sort of mind controlling serum on the population of New York, and he decided that he needed to stop it. I think he may have been right that he was the only one who could have stopped it when he did but... He called it in, Elaine, for the first time ever he called in backup, but we weren't fast enough.""

""Backup? You KNEW he was out there moonlighting and you didn't tell me?!""

""Much like I didn't tell your mother when you were hanging out with Susan Stanley in high school. He wasn't generally getting up to anything that was too much trouble. He stopped an armed robbery here and there, popped the tire of a stolen car by pointing at it, that sort of thing. Hell, even you and Susan had a little vigilante period. I know that you girls gave Jacob his justice, Elaine, and it was better that it came from you than me.""

Elaine's anger faded, if her own mother had found out what they'd done to Jacob that summer she'd *still* be grounded. Mrs Infinity had a point, she isn't responsible for telling people's secrets, even if she knows most of them. ""So who was running the lab that Henry broke up?""

""It was being run by the Baleful Brotherhood.""

""No,"" Elaine gasped. 

The Baleful Brotherhood was the most dangerous villain group on Earth. Unlike the Villainous League of Villains or the Gentlemanly Group of Gangster, the Baleful Brotherhood didn't play by the rules. They killed heroes and civilians without a care. They even put out a video once telling people they will gleefully kill their dogs if they get in the way of their plans. The Villain, Kristof Gnome was their spokesperson at the time, but after the dog murder comments pissed off the entire world, he was captured and imprisoned when someone saw him getting a coffee out of costume. Surprisingly hard to hide in public as an 28 inch tall villain with a noticeably melted face.

""Henry, 'Finglasers' as he was calling himself, destroyed their stockpile of serum with a ten-finger blast... but they made him pay for it before we could get there to help. We caught a lot of them, Elaine. Henry not only saved the entire city of New York, but he helped us to catch six of the eight remaining members of the Brotherhood. Henry is a real hero."" The Infinity pair in the back both patted her on the back, and deshimmered back down to only one Infinity in the back. 


""Is? How's surgery going? I know you're at least a couple of nurses in there."" 

""I am, and it is going well. Doctor McMedicine has just landed, flown in personally by Madam Hermes. He's going to scrub down and come help us finish.""

""Okay,"" Elaine leaned back into the seat in the back, worry writ large across her face as the car raced along the highway toward the city proper, toward Super Hospital.

Elaine closed her eyes and let herself get lost in the hypnotic hum of the car's tires on the highway, and suddenly they vanished. She opened her eyes and was surprised to see the car was flying. 

""Henry is back in one piece, and breathing on his own again, but still not entirely out of the woods,"" The Infinity in the front said. She had her hands off the wheel. ""It appears we have acquired a lift, to avoid some traffic.""

Madam Hermes set the car down on the roof of Super Hospital and opened the door for Elaine, ""Your son is a Hero, Ma'am. This way.""

""I'll take her,"" A Mrs Infinity that was waiting on the roof said. ""You go put the car some place it can leave on its own, please. I still have more driving to do in it.""

""Oh, right. Sorry."" A soon as Elaine stepped out, Madam Hermes hoisted the whole car onto her shoulders and flew away. 

Elaine followed this Mrs Infinity off the roof, down a set of stairs to the non-emergency elevator which only went down a few floors before opening to a waiting room. 

She waited.

And waited.

And waited.

She paced back and forth, while waiting until an old white haired 'mad scientist' looking type wearing wizard pajamas walked out of a portal that had suddenly sprung forth in the wall. 

""You the mother?"" the Alchemizer asked, brusquely.

""Yes? Of Henry. Is he alright?"" 

The ex-super villain didn't answer, he just snatched her by the hand and dragged her through the portal, into the operating room. 

""Listen, kid's gonna die here, but I can save him, just need your permission."" The old villain said. 

""BUT!"" A Mrs Infinity cut in. ""He will live forever, as far as we can tell. And never age another day.

""Yea I really wish I'd figured this one out fifty years sooner! Hah! eternal youth. At least this kid I'm giving it to will have some cool scars forever!"" The Alchemizer cackled. 

""The Alchemizer has offered his immortality serum to save Henry, there are... consequences for this decision, but Henry is in no state to make it himself,"" Doctor McMedicine said. ""I prefer using the serum because sticking my finger in Death's eye is a hobby of mine, but the decision is legally, yours to make, Ma'am.""

""I don't want to lose my boy, but..."" Elaine turned to Mrs Infinity, to Claire,"" What do I do?""

""Henry seems like a nice boy, better company for eternity than that madman."" She hooked a thumb at The Alchemizer. ""But you should do what you think is best for Henry, would he want to live forever, covered in potentially painful battle scars?""

""Not the be insensitive,"" The Alchemizer said,""But there is a limit on how long he'll last, sooo... tick tick.""

A few extra Mrs Infinity's appeared and muzzled the Alchemizer with their hands while Elaine thought.

""Okay, Do it. But promise me, Claire."" Elaine grabbed the nearest Mrs Infinity and looked her dead in the eyes, ""Promise me. You'll make him take a better hero name than Finglaser.""

Mrs Infinity laughed, and the ones of her holding the Alchimzer vanished, and he got straight to work. 

""I promise.""

My boyfriend is at work and I just watched a fantastic anime film, Belle (2021). 
It's such a gorgeous movie, not only the mix of animation styles but just the message. ""Be yourself"" is such a cliche and I get that, but it's so beautifully executed in this film. The similarities to Disney's Beauty and the Beast are undeniable, but this film's take on it is fresh and heartwrenching. The ending in particular left me in bittersweet tears, bitter because of the abuse Tomo and K endured, and sweet because of the courage all three children showed. Sure the ending had some plot holes but the emotional effect it had on me far outweighed whatever logical errors those plot holes made me think about. 
But now I've seen the movie, don't really have anyone to recommend it to because all my friends aren't really interested in that genre of film, and might as well talk about it for the internet to see.

More context below

I feel bad even asking this, but I'm 16 and my mother forces me to get up every Sunday and go to the pentecostal church that she likes, and I'm just going to be honest, I hate it. The church itself isn't like, terrible or anything, but it's not great either, and I swear every time I tell my mom I don't want to go, not because I don't like church in general, but because I don't like this specific church, she gets so mad and acts as if I've declared that I hate God or something. Also, I'm not even sure my money will go to a good cause, because from what I've seen, my church sure loves to host an awful lot of fellowship coffees and """"""""mission trips"""""""" that are just glorified vacations, where they don't actually serve/help anyone more than they sip mai tais and have worship music concerts. Matter of fact, the whole church seems to have this exclusionist attitude and an air of superiority over those who aren't christian, and if that's such a problem you'd think that they'd make more of an effort to spread the gospel, but no, they just pat themselves on the back for the bare minimum of believing in christ and fantasize about the day where all the woke people and muslims or whatever will burn in hell for eternity. I know that tithing also helps them like keep the lights on and stuff, and is in turn giving back to God by keeping his church alive, but they seemed just fine without my money when I was like six and got 20 bucks a year from my grandparents, and they are definitely not interested in expanding the church to more people, so I know for a fact my money is probably going to something frivolous and stupid.   


I know this makes me seem like a greedy pig, but I'm genuinely glad to give money to good causes whenever I get the chance, because if someone is suffering, often for no reason other than random circumstance, and I can make their life better with money that I don't need, why wouldn't I help them? Last year I found this charity where you could give money for kids to go to school, and I had enough money to pay for this one girl going off to kindergarten so I paid for it and didn't think much of it. A few months later they sent a picture of her on her first day of school, and she looked so happy that I legit burst into tears and questioned why I had been such a selfish idiot and not done more things like that. I got paid from my summer job a few days ago and I have a lot more money, but instead of helping children go to school I have to pay for my church elders to go to outback steakhouse.

I've asked my mom numerous times why I can't just donate what I'm supposed to tithe to charity, or even to **another church that I think would actually do something worthwhile with it,** but she insists that because it's 'my' church (that she dragged me to), I have to give them money that they apparently have no use for other than trips to rich neighborhoods in brazil. 

I need to know if I'm overreacting because genuinely she will have pry my money out of my cold dead hands before I give another cent to that church. Lord forgive me if I'm wrong but I just can't.",0,1756768771.0,Christianity,4,0.5,False

Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who shares quick recipes. seriously, they’ve saved me so many times on my crazy workdays.

I’m a nurse, and sometimes I get called into the hospital late at night when they’re short-staffed or something urgent comes up. That totally throws off my eating routine. Even when I pack food, I usually end up with just snacks, and honestly, they never leave me feeling great.

I’ve been doing intermittent fasting and keeping my carbs low to help with weight loss, and it’s been working. But with night shifts, sticking to it perfectly isn’t always realistic.

So I’ve been digging through YouTube and Reddit for easy smoothies and salads I can bring with me fresh stuff that actually works with my schedule. Out of all the smoothies I make, this one’s my favorite because it keeps me going through a shift way better than the usual coffee + ice combos.

1n63s7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreMemes/comments/1n63s7x/gilmore_girls_fan_fest_october_1719_2025_in/,"Gilmore Girls Fan Fest October 17-19, 2025 in Guilford, CT (a few tickets remain)!","
If you are a “newcomer”—defined as someone who had never attended a fall fan fest or did not attend in 2024–then today (September 1) is the last day to purchase tickets for Gilmore Girls Fan Fest IF you want to be eligible to attend the Friday afternoon special invite-only ambassador reception with the cast and crew guests (sans Kelly Bishop).  Why?  The organizers have set today as the cutoff for determining winners of the ambassador contest and those newcomers who are in the top 15 or who name a top 15 ambassador when purchasing a ticket are the only ones who can attend the reception.  I have included a screenshot to show where you enter the name of your ambassador(s) (hopefully my husband, Sean Mack, and me, Meghan Brooke Phillips) when purchasing your ticket.

Gilmore Girls Fan Fest (technically the Fan Fest Society’s Firelight Event) is being held for the second consecutive year in Guilford, CT.  (It’s the 10th Fan Fest and they have also held smaller GG events; I have attended every GGFF except the first and have attended every Fan Fest “smaller” event.). The dates are October 17-19, 2025.  

Guilford’s town green and the businesses, restaurants, town hall, and churches nearby are about as Stars Hollow as it gets, especially in the fall.  

You’ll be surrounded by fellow fans and immersed in a world of Gilmore Girls, which includes cast and crew guests who will often just chat with you on the street, outside of the event tent, near the fire pit, or even in line for the restroom (seriously, I met Kathleen Wilhoite, who played Liz Danes, in line for the restroom at GGFF in 2022).

This is not a traditional convention.  Although the $417 ticket (this includes a 3% transaction fee, which is labeled as a “ticketing fee”) may not be affordable for everyone, what you get is a bargain.  You pay for your own transportation, food, and lodging (if applicable), but all meet and greets, photos, and autographs are included.  (Note, due to stamina constraints, Kelly Bishop is doing a 90-minute panel but no meet and greets, autographs, etc.)

Guests 

Kelly Bishop (Emily Gilmore) 

Aris Alvarado (Cesar from Luke’s diner)

Olivia Hack (Tanna, one of Rory’s freshman year suitemates at Yale) 

Shelly Cole (Madeline from Chilton)

Emily Kuroda (Mrs. Kim) 

George Bell (dialogue coach and extra and featured extra on Gilmore Girls, including Professor Bell at Yale and one of the tombstone delivery people in A Year in the Life)

Vanessa Marano (April Nardini)

Matt Newton (son of the Harvard alum in the episode where Rory and Lorelai go to the Harvard alum’s house for lunch)

Kathleen Wilhoite (Liz Danes)

Nick Holmes (Robert from the Life and Death Brigade; Rory is his date to the LDB Tarantino party) 

Stan Zimmerman (Gilmore Girls writer) 

Valerie Campbell (key set costumer for all but the first 10-11 episodes of the original series and costume supervisor on A Year in the Life)

Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have—it’s an honor to help spread the word about Fan Fest.  (Also, I’m not an organizer or owner for Fan Fest.  I make no money off of this.  I’m just a fellow fan who is externally grateful for the experiences I have had attending Fan Fest and the lifechanging experiences, including being part of the Fan-Mily).

If you decide to purchase tickets, I have a favor to ask.  There is a line for “ambassador.”  If you have never attended a Firelight Event or did not attend in 2024, then you are eligible to list an ambassador.  If I place in the top 15, there are perks for both of us.  (I was 2nd in 2024 and tied for 3rd or 4th in 2023).  More than the perks, it would just mean a lot to me.  (Regardless of whether you list me as an ambassador or if you purchase tickets, I’m here to answer questions.)

If you have Gilmore Girls obsessed friends and loved ones (or even someone who would come with you just to see you happy in Gilmore Girls heaven), tag them in this post, too!  (My fiancé has attended with me since 2022 and even proposed during Nick Holmes’ meet and greet in 2024.)

The taste pre light (cold draw I think is the term) is pepper and wood but creamier than a Fuente and less in your face.

The first puffs are a bit peppery and it immediately got a earthy note. 

Pretty quickly it settled into a coffee and very slight cream note. Not much pepper and not any drastic changes for a while. 

The back third or so had the familiar ""cigar leather"" many get becoming the eventual lead note.

Burn was fine, needed a touch up once or twice but nothing bad. No unraveling/or any canoeing, etc.

Verdict: medium strong. Nicotine seemed a hair high (but I'm in the mountains and hiking every morning so maybe I need to eat more). Good flavors and Great value.

I only have a couple days left and yet it feels like a lifetime and I just need to vent. I really can't stand working here and idk how anyone can. The couple coworkers I've told I'm quitting have been shocked, probably because I 'seem' happy. But I'm not. I carry a smile throughout the day for the sake of my clients, even though working here is misery I can still feed off their energy and have a good time interacting with them. That doesn't equate to happiness. I do it for my clients. That's it.
I really don't think I have the patience it takes to work a strict memory care facility where everyone's demented. I've worked in memory care units of assisted living facilities many times and I could do that any day, which is why I thought I'd like working here, but it's so drastically different than a full facility being memory care. I don't feel happy for my clients the way other caregivers are (ex: a chronically constipated client finally having a BM, a client that never wants a shower wanting a shower etc) because all it means to me is even more work than we're already overworked with. We're responsible for laundry, showers, serving food and cleaning the dining room, making coffee etc on top of client care it's TOO MUCH. I don't feel that same level of attachment and passion I usually do for them because I'm always stressed out. When clients don't listen and continue doing things that can get them hurt despite reminders I find myself on the verge of mental breakdown. Oh and pagers? Don't get me started. I don't even know what their use is since most of these folks are too far gone to know how to even use their call lights and a majority of the time we're watching them anyway. But these things go off for the SMALLEST THINGS, such as a community door being opened. It buzzes like crazy all the time and we have to keep resetting it. It's like having an annoying, un-fun tomagachi. And the walk-e-talk-e's are basically just tools so management can harass us throughout the day. There is ZERO patience. They'll call us because D2 or C1 needs assistance and when we tell them we're in the middle of care, they keep calling every few seconds.

I use up all my patience at this place to the point I don't have any patience left for things outside of work. I never have any energy to do anything for myself, like cleaning my living space, doing my own laundry (I don't until I literally HAVE to) etc. My living space is a mess and I hate looking at it but I'm too chronically tired all the god damn time to do anything about it.

1n63mnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1n63mnp/breaking_news_admin_solves_burnout/,[BREAKING NEWS] Admin Solves Burnout,"**Abstract:**  
Admin has finally cracked the code: the cure for clerkship fatigue is a *mandatory 3-hour wellness lecture* and a reflective essay. Mid-rotation. In this non-consensual trial, preliminary data suggests a statistically significant increase in exhaustion, antidepressant use, and caffeine dependency. 

**Introduction:** Burnout has plagued medical students for decades, often attributed to long hours, lack of autonomy, and crushing debt. While prior interventions have focused on improving sleep, mentorship, and workload reduction, these approaches require systemic change and thus were deemed “infeasible”. Instead, we hypothesized that a single PowerPoint-based intervention would not only solve burnout, but also generate new metrics to justify additional tuition fees.

**Methods:**  
Third-year medical students were forcibly extracted from wards, studying, and ""resident-only"" free lunches. They were then exposed to:

* **3 continuous hours** of lecture, tailored to be perfectly irrelevant to reality.
* **1 reflective essay** assignment with a minimum of 500 words requiring introspection on “how can you identify burnout and what can *you* do to fix it?”

**Results**:

**Table 1. Post-Intervention Symptoms**

|Symptom|Pre (%)|Post (%)|p-value|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Exhaustion|89|92|<0.001|
|Caffeine Consumption|70|96|<0.001|
|Antidepressant Use|32|57|<0.001|
|Gratitude|12|0|NS|

*Figure 1 (not shown): Graph of admin self-satisfaction, which spiked to 100% after rollout.*

**Discussion**:

This intervention conclusively demonstrates that **the most effective way to address overwork is by adding more mandatory work.** Students initially suggested alternatives such as “accessible call rooms for 24 hour shifts”, ""fixing the only coffee maker students are allowed to use"", or “protected time off,” but these were rejected for being logistically inconvenient and not in line with the budget funded by *your* tuition. Future directions include a **mandatory wellness quiz** with a greater than 80% required  or students face a remediation course and a **reflection survey** about your reflection essay.

**Conclusion:**  
Burnout officially cured. Please submit your essays by Friday at 5 PM EST (yes, we know our school is in PST) or you’ll fail professionalism.

**TL;DR:** Admin decided the solution to burnout was… *more things to do.* Inspired by a true story. ",56,1756768040.0,medicalschool,2,0.99,False

I've been addicted since i was 15 and didn't really clue in to the problems it was causing until recently when i went a few weeks without. I sadly started back up since i do love the taste of coffee, but in the past week of drinking it all my symptoms have returned.

Symptoms i've had since high school more or less.

**Symptoms:**

* Lack of focus
* Emotional Numbness
* Stress
* Inability to find motivation
* increased fear of failure/rejection
* Can't even do things i enjoy doing (like video games. I will just browse the web endless for no reason.)
* lack of energy (ironically)

All of these symptoms vanished after 1 week of no caffeine and were fully gone by the end of 3 weeks. I super regret starting up again.

Another thing i've noticed is they're worse now and i think that's cause as a teen i only drank 2 cups per day max (starbuck lattes) which is way less caffeine that i have been drinking recently (7 cups). 

  
Overall the lack of focus/anxiety/disociation has followed my since i was 15ish. So i firmly believe it has been caffeine this entire time.

  
Wish me luck guys <3

1n63gcj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n63gcj,Officially 1 week as Vegan Update.,"Took a couple of pics when I remembered throughout the week.  Apologies for the poor camera angles I was very hungy.

For context, I am 6'7, 240 pounds. Doing 18:6 intermittent fasting ( 4 : 00 PM - 10:00 PM Eating), sleeping 10:00 PM - 5:30 AM and working out twice a day, every day but the weekends. I've pretty much eaten healthily my whole life, like whole foods ( not the store), but ate pretty much anything if I felt like it from blue takkis to alligator meat as I loved trying new foods. I would like to stay committed long term to veganism as well as gain muscle mass. I would like to stay away from vegan alternative meat products like the impossible burger, and focus more on quality home cooked meals and possibly good vegan restaurants. 

For anyone thinking of doing anything similar, or just switching over, I can confidently say that as long as you prepare and hold yourself accountable at least the first week will be a breeze, a very pleasant soothing breeze. 

I've had no trouble digestively, with my sleep or energy levels. If anything I've had more consistent energy levels throughout the day. (However, I do have to note that I've stopped vaping, drinking alcohol and coffee, and any other stimulants other than loose leaf green tea on July 17th - idk how much those changes are impacting the energy levels as well) 

  
Just wanted to share my short 1st week story, and thank the community for helping me along this first week.

I've tried many recipes that were absolutely delicious, however, I will say that the dip I made in the second picture was a stand out BANGER. Can't take credit for it, my mom found the recipe on insta, and I'll post that below. Be warned, if you don't like the smell of sour cream and onion chips you won't like this.

1n63g2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1n63g2s/did_i_handle_this_customer_wrong/,Did I handle this customer wrong?,"Hello first time doing this job and started in july, today at lunch I had a sir that didn’t finish his meat because he called me and told me that the meat was hard and was definitely not fresh and if the cook wanted it he could eat it (sarcastically), I said I was very sorry and usually I would offer to make it again but considering he was questioning the quality of the meat I found that useless so instead I asked if I could offer him anything else but he only wanted a coffee. At the time of paying he criticized the cook again so I asked if he didn’t want to pay for it and he said “no I can pay for it but I will go down to the reception to complain” so I gave him the preview bill as I always do to make the client check if everything is ok and then he paid, I thanked him and wished him a good day but he didn’t say anything and went away. Turns out he came down to the reception to complain about the fact that he had to pay it, he said that I made him pay it while somewhere else if he left a plate they wouldn’t make him pay and that we weren’t even sorry.

I don’t understand why he did this, I thought I did everything right so I don’t understand why he complained about me, I feel sorry about it. What do you think? Should have I acted differently? Did I make a mistake?",4,1756767570.0,Serverlife,10,0.84,False
1n63ec7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1n63ec7/i_used_atomic_habits_for_studying_and_it_actually/,I used Atomic Habits for studying and it actually worked,"Okay, so I finally read Atomic Habits (I know l'm late) because I was tired of cramming and feeling stressed. I gave a few things from the book a shot, and two weeks later, I've been way more organized with my studying and not freaking out before every quiz or exam. Here's what I did from the book:

1. ﻿﻿﻿Habit Stacking - Started studying right after my coffee every morning. Now I can't make coffee without automatically studying for a bit. Weirdly works.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Bribing myself - I’ll watch a 10-minute YouTube vid after studying a chunk of my notes every hour or so. Super motivating.
3. Identity Shift - Instead of saying, ""I should study,"" I'm like, ""I'm the type of person who studies every day."" Makes skipping feel wrong.

4 Fix Your Space - Cleaned my desk, hid my phone, and used a website blocker every single day. No more zoning out for hours. ﻿﻿

Results:

* Actually finished an essay early (who am l?)
* studying feels part of my day now, not forced.
* Stress has been way lower for exams and quizzes
* now I’ve been getting excited to study

Definitely not a miracle, but honestly, it's been so much better than before. If you struggle with procrastination (like me), this might help. Anyone else tried it?

My only other hack is using a Google chrome extension called Study AI by Edu Space to help me study, just like any resource tho make sure you’re not just cheating with it and actually learn.
