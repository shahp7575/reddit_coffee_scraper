He also enjoys bitter tea and coffee, which I enjoy as well, and he needs his quiet time too.!<

1lyjysb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lyjysb/help_how_to_deal_with_disrespectful_relatives/,Help! how to deal with disrespectful relatives?,"Hey everyone, so we've been away for a couple of days off of city staying at my cousin's apartment. To start off my sister, my mom and I are not very found of my dad's side of family I can't disclose the reasons in here but they can be condensed to displays of covert disrespect disguised as playful jokes. I'm disappointed to admit that same thing can't be said about my dad, he assumes that they're not ill intended, his judgment is clouded by their wagtail behavior. My mom didn't come with us because she knew the disrespect is bound to happen again. Last time she had visited she was subjected to blatant disrespect and belittling from my dad infront of my cousin's family. It is a delicate matter since my dad has deepest affection to his niece and his family (his niece is the father of the family and he is actually my cousin and his kids are closer to us age wise) and we don't want to upset that's the sole reason we tolerate this behavior. Since our visit these two things has happened 

1- today we went to a mall my sister my nieces wife and I, we ended up at Walmart as our last stop everything was going well until that point. So my nieces wife let's call her Jane, picked up some groceries saying that we need some stuff for tomorrow's meal (since we'll go out tomorrow she's gonna prepare a meal for all of us) we went to checkout and pay for what we got. I should emphasize that we come from a culture where hospitality is highly regarded and putting the guests in any situation where they might feel like a burden is very disrespectful and make them pay for their stay is super distasteful. So we went to checkout and I'm about to pass her and my sister is already waiting while she's frantically looking for something inside her bag she's shouting that she doesn't have her phone and that the only way to pay is by her wallet application she's shouting at us if she has forgotten it somewhere and to call her. So we're just standing there dumbfounded thinking she'll at least have some emergency cash in her bag to pay for the groceries. So some moments go by which was consisted of me looking at my sister and the poor cashier lady who's just waiting for the completion of this transaction. Me and my sister are shocked at this point and lastly my sister offers to pay but Jane refuses and says we will return the items. I need to make it clear that my sister and I didn't mind paying, earlier we got gift's for Jane's daughter which costed more than these groceries. But in the slim chances that she might've really forgotten her phone and she doesn't carry her physical wallet and the fact that she neither possess an emergency cash I let that slide. Shit happens and you find yourself in unpredictable embarassing situations and thinking that's the case I didn't take it to heart. 

2- we come home from mall within 10 minutes of arrival she asks how much my sister weights now I taught nothing of it afterall who asks this question with malicious intent right? She makes my sister go on the scale just to make sure and after five times she insists that my sister is using the scale the wrong way. Now I don't know if she was trying to prove that my sister was weighing less or more of what she told him. But then after coming back to the room that I was now, she rants about how my sister had gained weight and kinda linking that to her own weight? My sister said Jane was comparing her weight to hers and make her feel bad about it. Now this was intentional and inexcusable if you let this level of disrespect slide you've disrespected yourself. Earlier when we were in McDonald's I we took coffee for ourselves and I got a sweet too. Now my sister is a coffee addict and this was her second coffee of the day we sat at the table and for a while she didn't stop telling me sister to stop drinking so much coffee as if she's a doctor who's advice should be highly regarded. Mind you my sister has the common sense but she was going on and on with this concern of hers until I changed the subject. So I started eating my cookie and Jane and I are sitting next to each other with my sister on the opposite side when Jane turn to me with a maxim torso twist that her body could master and analysis my face then comments as if it's the most groundbreaking discovery of her life that I have acne and I should stop eating sweets. I laughed it off cuz I don't know how one can possess a satisfactory answer to this question. 

3- she (the whole family possibly) is plain racist. When we were on our way to the bus stop after exiting the mall and we were waiting to cross the street when a black lady passes by with a stroller this is her comment "" black women show so much skin...they wanna show off......but there's nothing interesting to see..... but when white people dress this way it looks good on them"" mind you we're in Mississauga, Ont. Where the temperature was 32 degrees at that exact time. The lady's outfit was too revealing for her taste but she wouldn't have criticize the outfit had the lady been a white women. Then she adds that when they were in Germany the government would take the black people and send them away to distant towns because they would ruin the beauty of the city? She said this in a tone as if this attitude towards black people should inspire other nations. Now I was utterly disgusted with this woman. 

I need y'all's advice because quite frankly my sister and I have never associated with people the likes of Jane. Now that I think about it my mom did a good thing for not coming with us I'm disgusted by her behavior. Specially in the Walmart incident, I'm not upset about the fact that my sister paid it's the sheer audacity of hers to think that we're stupid to believe her excuse that she did actually lost/forgot her phone. Mind you we spent like three hours walking around the mall and going to the bathroom and you're telling me it never crossed her mind to check her bag for her phone? Also funny enough when we arrived at their apartment she hadn't forgotten the key like what are the chances? This situation was so ridiculous that it was funny like there's no way this women did that and she's deadass serious about this. We were laughing about it but sad thing is we're not in charge of the situation. Had it been up to my sister and I we'd leave right after she forced my sister to set foot on the scale. But truely it's disgusting never in my life I've heard of people like this as guests. Mind you when they visit us they couldn't ask for more. The food is always ready the best meals, we moved them around to Montreal when they come to visit us in Quebec. We went to Quebec city and ended staying overnight because my cousin seemed to love the city even though it wasn't financially convenient for us but because they're so precious to my dad we ended up staying. My mom said Jane has a reputation for being stingy so I'm skeptical that the incident was a mere unfortunate coincidence. Please help guys right now I should be sleeping but I'm writing this because I'm so uncomfortable with the whole thing and we're staying for another whole day. She's intrusive and her comments makes us uncomfortable as I said I'm tolerating out of respect for my dad. ",1,1752380903.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I doordashed some Pepto and the pain subsided a little bit but when I went to the bathroom an hour later my stool was black. The pain came back full force a few hours later and not even a hot bath was helping with any kind of relief so I ended up drinking more Pepto around 2am. I mean this was the worst pain I think I’ve ever felt in my life. I ended up going to bed around 6am when it calmed down a little bit.

It’s now 11:20 the next day and my stool literally looks like coffee grounds but I took Pepto twice and I know that can make it black? It’s also tender to touch in the upper right part of my abdomen and my back and front part of my abdomen feels heavy. Not super painful, but def cramping. Headache all day.

I’m thinking of putting the tv on the back wall (bathroom wall) to the right of the door, with it on a bracket so it can be pulled out. Display case/bookshelf behind the stairs on the left side of the bathroom door. Then I’m kind of stuck with the lounge & armchair. Lounge in front of the window?

For colour, I need something that will suit the bathroom tile but I want something dark & then I don’t know if I should do the skirting boards & window trims as well or leave them white.

⸻

Hello. My name is Diamond Ball.
Also known as “bitch,” “slut,” “whore,” and “cunt” — by the woman who gave me life.

If she was ever a good mother, it must have been before I started forming memories.
Because I can’t recall a single moment of selflessness.
No protection.
No peace.
Not once — not from her.

⸻

I remember when I was eleven.
It was a Saturday — one of the few mornings we were allowed to sleep in after five long days of school.
But I was woken up at 7 a.m. by my mother.

She wanted me to ride with her down the street so she could grab a coffee.
I was tired. I said I didn’t want to go.

She threw a coat in my face and snapped,
“I’m not going by myself.”

I told her again — softly, honestly — that I was tired.
She punched me in the face.

I fell backward onto her bed, stunned.
She walked away like nothing had happened.

From down the hall, she called,
“Get up and put the coat on.”

I did.
Tears staining my cheeks, I put on the coat and followed her to the car.

We drove in silence.

She went into the store and came back with two coffees —
one for her, and one for me.

That was her apology.
A coffee.
For her 11-year-old daughter.

That was the first time she hit me.
It wasn’t the last.

⸻

I’m the oldest of four.

I was born in 1998.
My brother Jimmy came a year later, in 1999.
Dustin followed in 2001, and Isaiah, the youngest, in 2006.

But before any of us, there was Destiny —
my mother’s first daughter.
She was born on March 18th, 1996 —
exactly two years before me.
She was born with a heart defect.
She passed away on March 27th, 1996.

She didn’t even make it to two weeks old.

And then, two years later to the day, I arrived.
Same birthday. Same gender. Same place in the family.

Sometimes I wonder what that meant to my mother.
She lost one daughter…
and was handed another.

A chance to love.
A chance to heal.
A rainbow baby.

But she didn’t treat me like a gift.
She barely treated me like I was hers at all.
Not even like a child.
Not even like a human being.

And that kind of rejection…
haunts me.

⸻

From Monday to Friday evening, we had a sober parent.

But once the sun went down on Friday,
whatever shred of “mother” she’d been holding onto during the week —
it disappeared.

It was like clockwork.
She became a loud, provocative, vulgar, sloppy mess.
And those “motherly instincts” she claimed to have?
They were only ever reserved for my brothers.

I was the oldest.
I was the daughter.
And I was invisible.

I can’t even count how many times I had to wake her up —
passed out on the toilet,
pants down, body limp, mouth half open.

That was my mother.

That was my Friday night.

⸻

Our weekends?
They were all about my brothers and their baseball.

Practice.
Games.
Trips to the field.
Every Saturday and Sunday was reserved for them.

I remember once — I told my mom I wanted to try cheerleading.
Just one thing for me.

She let me go to the tryouts. I was excited.
Hopeful.

Then she heard the price.

And just like that, it was over.
No explanation. No apology.
Just silence.

I never went back.
And I never heard another word about it.

Meanwhile, my brothers?
They got everything.

Uniforms.
Cleats.
Gloves.
Bats.
Whatever they needed, they had it — no questions asked.

I learned pretty quickly that wanting something was a setup for disappointment.
Especially if you were me.
Especially if you were the girl.

⸻

My father worked religiously —
long hours, always gone.
So it was usually just us with her.
Mostly just my brothers with her.

I was only ever relevant when she was drunk.

She didn’t want to drink alone.
And for some reason… I became her audience.

She’d let me stay up late —
until the early hours of the next day.
Not out of bonding.
Not out of love.
She just didn’t want to be alone.

And when I got too tired, she’d bribe me to stay awake.
Sometimes with food.
Sometimes with promises.
Other times… with threats.

She’d flick her lighter on and hold it near me —
laughing, saying it would “wake me up.”

And once… when I was sixteen,
she followed through.

She burnt my thigh.
With her lighter.
Because I was tired.
Because I didn’t want to sit with her and watch her destroy herself.

⸻

The first hit — physically — came when I was eleven.
But the first mental hit came then, too.

I went through premature puberty.
My body changed faster than I could understand it.
By third grade, I had C cups.

While other girls wore cute little training bras,
I was stuck in adult bras — stiff, tight, and impossible to hide.

I hated them.

Every woman knows the relief of coming home and finally taking off her bra.
That first deep breath. That little bit of peace.

I wasn’t allowed that.

I wasn’t allowed to take mine off —
not even at home.
Not around her.

But it wasn’t embarrassment.
She wasn’t ashamed of my body.

She was jealous.
And she was outraged.

The sight of me — a young girl trapped in a woman’s body —
infuriated her.

Instead of protecting me…
she punished me.

⸻

I slept in a full-on bra for years.

Because if I dared to take it off — even for a second of relief — the comments would start.

“That’s disgusting.”
“They’re too big.”
“They swing around like apes on trees.”
“Why are they shaped like that?”
“They look like torpedoes.”

But then came the worst one — the one that changed everything.

“You’re not gonna walk around like that in front of my husband.”

My biological father.

Like I was some threat.
Like I had chosen to look this way.
Like I should be ashamed for existing in my own body.

“If anyone is gonna walk around like that, it’s me.”
“You look like a slut.”

She hated me for developing.
She hated me for growing into a body that she couldn’t control.
And so she did the one thing a mother should never do —

She made me hate it too.

⸻

Then it moved on to shorts.

I couldn’t wear them.
Not in public.
Not even around the house.

If I ever tried,
I’d feel the sting of a smack —
sharp, sudden, intentional.
Or I’d hear the words that cut deeper than any slap.

The message was always the same:
You don’t deserve to be comfortable.
You don’t deserve to be seen.

That was the consequence
for showing too much skin
in the house I was raised in.

⸻

My mother’s weight fluctuated severely while I was growing up.
She’d gain, then lose, then gain again.
And the heavier she got, the worse her treatment of me became.

It was like every pound she carried turned into more resentment,
more jealousy,
more rage —
and she projected it all onto me.

I became the target.
Not because I did anything wrong,
but because I represented everything she hated about herself.

My changing body, my youth, my femininity —
they didn’t make her proud.
They made her furious.

And I paid for it.
With my comfort.
With my safety.
With my self-worth.

⸻

There’s more.

So much more than what I’ve written here.
More memories.
More pain.
More truth.

But for now, this is where I pause.

This is just the beginning of Mommy Issues —
a space where I will speak,
unravel,
and heal on my terms.

When I’m ready, I’ll share more.
Until then, thank you for reading the parts of me I wasn’t supposed to say out loud.

Let me know if you want pt.2

1lyjsk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1lyjsk0/unpopular_opinion_your_best_content_ideas_happen/,Unpopular opinion: Your best content ideas happen when you're NOT trying to create content.,"I've noticed this pattern everywhere - in coffee shops, during commutes, in random conversations. People share the most insightful thoughts when they're just... talking.

But then they sit down to write a LinkedIn post and suddenly it's like pulling teeth.

**The problem?** We treat content creation like formal writing when it should feel more like conversation.

Think about it:

* You explain complex concepts perfectly to colleagues
* You have strong opinions during team meetings
* You share valuable insights in casual conversations

But somehow when it's ""content creation time,"" we freeze up.

**The voice-to-text shift is happening.** More professionals are using voice notes not just for messaging, but as their primary way to capture and develop ideas. It's faster, more natural, and honestly captures personality better than typing.

Working for Will (AI LinkedIn ghostwriter for busy professionals via WhatsApp) has shown me how powerful this approach is. People who struggle with writing suddenly become articulate when they just talk through their thoughts. No pressure, no editing paralysis - just capturing ideas as they happen.

*Even with writing longer-form articles, when you’re too close to the task, you miss things.*

One day at preschool we learned about making collages. I was so excited to try making a collage at home. So after school I asked my mom if I could make a collage on the coffee table. She smiled and said I could. She got me some supplies like glue and colored paper and glitter, and I also went to my bedroom and got some of my small toys like my McDonald’s happy meal toys. Mom left the room and I went to work creating my masterpiece. I started by making a river of glitter. The table was glass, so it looked really cool when I squirted the glue onto it and then poured on some glitter. Next I ripped up some paper and glued it next to the river to make some flowers. Then I put some glue on one of my toys and put it near the flowers. My collage was already so pretty! But then my mom came in and looked mad. She told me that I was supposed to make the collage on the colored paper, not on the coffee table. But I literally asked her if I could make a collage on the coffee table and she said yes!

Context: Yesterday, nag date kami ng BF ko sa isang sikat na coffee shop sa Makati. Honestly, may gagawin talaga ako kahapon pero since nagsabi sya na gusyo nya akong makita at makasama, pumayag na akong kitain sya.

Before kami magkita, nag message na ako na masama yung pakiramdam ko pero tutuloy ako (that's my way of saying na ""medyo habaan mo yung pasensya mo sa akin dahil gusto din naman kitang makita kesa mag pahinga.""). May argument na agad kami dahil hindi pala malinaw sa kanya yung meeting place namin at for the nth time hindi rin nasunod yung oras na sya mismo yung nag set.

Dumating sya sa meeting place dala-dala yung work nya (laptop). The whole time na magkasama kami, lagi lang syang nakaharap sa laptop. Humingi ako ng pasensya na sana pala hindi na lang ako pumayag na kitain sya dahil feeling ko nakaabala pa ako. Sinabihan ko rin sya na gusto ko munang maglakad-lakad at babalik na lang ako sa coffee shop. Kasi more than 1 hour na kaming nakaupo tapos wala man lang ginagawa. Pero ayaw nya. Kapag umalis daw ako sa kinauupuan ako, lalayasan daw nya ako. Kaya hindi na ako umalis.

And since masama nga yung pakiramdam ko, hindi ko namalayan na hindi na pala ako sumasagot kapag kausap nya ako. Out of nowhere, hindi na sya nagsalita. Kinausap ko sya kung anong problema. Sinabi nya na ginagantihan nya raw ako. I explained my side na baka dahil masama yung pakiramdam ko kaya siguro ako gano'n. Ilang segundo lang pinakita nya sa akin na nag bu-book na sya ng MoveIt. Ibinabalik nya yung regalo na ibinigay ko sa kanya.

Sa parteng 'yan, nainis na ako. Tumayo at nilayasan na sya. Umupo ako sa isang bench kasi hindi ko na makita yung nilalakaran ko dahil sa mga luha. Noong huminahon na ako, nakita ko bigla yung message nya. Imbis na mag apologize o kausapin ako, sinend nya yung location ng MoveIt. Sinabi rin nya na iniwan nya sa staff ng coffee shop yung regalo ko at pinalabas na may nakalimot ng gamit. I decided to go.

Ilang beses syang nag chat, text, at tumawag sa phone ko. Hinahanap ako. Pinababalik. Binabawi lahat ng sinabi nya. Naaawa ako at gusto kong bumalik pero merong pumitik sa utak ko na parang kailangan ko nang protektahan yung sarili ko. Kaya hindi ko na inisip yung 50+ messages nya ng ""Nasan ka?"" at ""T*ngina nasaan ka?!"" Umuwi ako from Makati papuntang Bulacan.

TL;DR: I just know that something snapped in me. I think I was emotionally tortured, again. Kaya nag walk-out na lang ako (for the first time) at umuwi ng Bulacan.

Previous attempts: Around 12am kanina, nag usap kami. Sinabi ko na feeling ko ako yung mali kasi nag expect ako na maiintindihan ako kahit na sinabi ko na masama yung pakiramdam ko.

Okay, buckle up theres alot and here’s the backstory. I’m a 20 year old female and my now ex-boyfriend, a 22 year old male, and I had been dating since I was 14 and he was 15. Things worked well for a while. For years, I really believed we were good together. But about a year ago, everything started to change. He started acting downright mean toward me. Not just passive-aggressive, straight-up cruel. One time, I texted him and asked if he wanted to go out to eat, just something casual, and he texted back, “Why the f\*\*k would I be seen in public with you?” Later, he apologized and claimed he was “going through a lot since he stopped smoking.” Like an idiot, I forgave him, thinking maybe it was a one-time thing and he really was just having a rough day. It wasn’t.

From that point on, every single day, he was mean as hell to me. He always had a problem with something I did. If I went out with my friends, even for a quick coffee, he’d blow up my phone, call me a slut, accuse me of cheating, and tell me I was embarrassing him. He made me feel like I couldn’t do anything without him finding a reason to lose his shit.

Then Christmas of last year, it got even worse. We were at my best friend’s house, a girl I’d known since fourth grade. Let’s call her Mia. All of our other friends were there too. Everyone around me was drinking, but since I’m underage, I didn’t. About halfway through the night, Mia came up to me and said, “Me and the others are heading to a bar. You can’t come, obviously.” She basically kicked me out of her house. Then she started begging my boyfriend to come with them. She looked right at me, rolled her eyes, and said, “Don’t be a f\*\*king Debbie-downer. If you don’t come because of her, we’re gonna be pissed.” And he went. Without even hesitating. He pulled a crumpled $20 from his wallet, threw it at me like I was nothing, and said, “Get your ass an Uber,” as he walked out with them.

The only other person still at the house was my boyfriend’s best friend. Let’s call him Jake. Jake was drunk, laid out on the couch like a corpse. Since he was my boyfriend’s best friend, and because I didn’t feel right leaving him like that, I offered to pay for his Uber too. I already knew that $20 my boyfriend threw at me wouldn’t cover my ride home, so I was already prepared to pay more. Jake mumbled a thank you and said he appreciated it, promising to pay me back the next time he got paid.

I went to Mia’s room to grab my purse and jacket, planning to order the rides and head out. That’s when I suddenly heard the bedroom door lock behind me. I’m not going to spell out what happened next, but you can guess. Finally, when he was done, or when he passed out, he fell asleep like nothing happened. I had to shove him completely off of me, grab my things, and run. I left him there, still asleep, and I don’t regret that for a second.

When I got back to my apartment, shaking and crying, I called my boyfriend. I was hysterical, trying to explain what had happened, my voice cracking and my heart pounding. On the other end, there was silence. The only thing I could hear was the bass from whatever club they were at and Mia’s voice in the background, screaming some song. Then, finally, he scoffed and snapped, “That’s your fking fault, dumbass. You should’ve left when I told you to. What the fk did you expect staying there?”

I was speechless. My boyfriend of years, the person I thought loved me, just said that to me. He hung up without saying another word. A minute later, he texted me, “I’m not coming home tonight.” I texted back, “Don’t f\*\*king come back at all.” I called my mom, sobbing and shaking, and by 6 AM the next morning, she was banging on my apartment door. She threw all of his shit outside, changed the locks, and begged me to go to the police. But before my mom even got there, Jake texted me. He said, “Yo, why the hell’d you leave me there?” Then claimed he blacked out and didn’t remember anything. As if that excused what he did.

Then Mia texted me. She called me an “attention-seeking psycho bitch.” She accused me of making everything up for drama, told me I was a f\*\*king liar, and threatened me. She said, “If you even think about going to the cops, I’ll beat your ass so bad you won’t be able to leave your apartment.” And the sick thing is, I was, and have always been, scared of her. Mia and I had been friends since the fourth grade. She was always the violent one, always in fights over dumb middle school drama, always suspended, and ended up getting kicked out of school at 16. So when she threatened me, I knew she meant it. I didn’t respond for a couple of days. When I finally did, I snapped. I cussed them all out, told them to stay the hell away from me, and said if they didn’t contact me, I wouldn’t contact them.

Fast forward to two weeks ago. I was at the mall shopping with my mom and sister, trying to have a normal day for once. That’s when I spotted Mia and my ex-boyfriend together, basically dry-humping in the middle of the damn mall. I thought I was going to throw up. I tried to avoid them, kept my head down, and stayed out of sight. But later on, when I went to the bathroom alone, I ran into Mia. She grinned at me and said, “Hey there, bitch.” I didn’t say a word, just kept walking. She grabbed my shirt, yanked me around to face her, and started screaming in my face. “You fking liar. I still can’t believe you broke up with him over that stupid shit. Making up some sick story like that, acting like a fking victim. You’re f\*\*king pathetic.” Thank God my sister walked in right then. She pushed Mia off me, grabbed my arm, and pulled me out of the bathroom. We left the mall immediately. Since then, I’ve been getting a million texts every day from all three of them. They’re cussing me out, calling me every name you can think of. Mia even sent me another message saying, “Next time I see you in public, you won’t have that pretty f\*\*king face left.” Am i the asshole?",1,1752379673.0,AITAH,7,0.6,False

Orioles starter Brandon Young (6.14 ERA) has been the definition of unreliable, friends. Baltimore has lost 4 of Young’s last 5 starts, and their opponents have scored at least 5 runs in 4 of his last 5 outings. To be frank, I won’t be surprised if the Marlins offense gets to the Orioles pitcher early on; Trevor Rogers was a much tougher arm than Brandon Young, and even he couldn’t keep the Miami offense at bay in the second game of this series. My money’s on the Marlins to score at least 5 here.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/T5hvQZvotD): **May 13, 2025**

The title pretty much tells the outline of the story....

I am a 16F, and I am living with my Dad who has 100% sole custody of me. He has had custody since I was 2.

My parents had me when they were quite young (my Dad was 18 and 'Mum' was 20), and 'Mum' couldn't cope with how my existence inconvenienced her education and social life. She wanted to enjoy university, and my existence got in the way of all of that. Therefore she upped sticks and left my Dad to raise me by himself.

And my Dad is the complete opposite and has more worth in one of his pinky fingers than her entire existence.

He has been both the mother and the father in my life. He has showered me with the love and affection that I needed. He has been strict with me when needed, and has guided me to be the person that I am today.

And he has never missed a day or an opportunity of letting me know how much he loves me. He is my hero, and I doubt that I will ever love anyone else as much as I do my Dad. I am unashamed to admit that I am a Daddy's Girl.

Our life has been very stable, and he has done an amazing job of raising me throughout my childhood and into my teenage years. But now the egg donor (I won't apologise for calling her that, because just the thought of calling her 'Mum' turns my stomach), is trying to rock the boat.

She's contacted me, asking if we could meet up, because she wants to reconnect with me... She gave a sob story about how she's spent years regretting her decision of not being in my life, and how she's now at a point in her life (mentally and financially) where she wants to give me what I am owed from her. She also has 2 children (7 & 5), and she is hopeful that I can develop a relationship with my 'siblings'.

This is where I feel that I might've been an AH. Because in an outburst of sudden anger at suddenly being contacted, I told her to f\*\*\* off, and that nothing that she says could convince me to have anything to do with someone who I only consider to be an egg donor and incubator in my life.

I thought that I gave up on my anger and resentment towards her a long time ago. But it felt like the dam broke, as I let out all of that anger and resentment that built up all those years ago, as I unleashed all of my pent up feelings towards her.

Because the anger that I felt wasn't only for myself and how she abandoned me. I also felt anger for the hurt, pain and struggles that she caused for my Dad. And here she is, trying to reopen those old wounds that both myself and my Dad have suffered at her selfish hands.

I told her all of that, and how I consider myself to be the child of one parent, as the other one has been dead for most of my life.

I'm not ashamed to admit that I took some joy in telling her how much of amazing father and man that my Dad is, and that both myself and my Dad had a lucky escape getting away from someone who is as narcissistic and toxic as she is.

And the only point where I remained somewhat civil, was when telling her how I don't want anything to do with her children. Because despite my anger and resentment towards her, those children are blameless and innocent. And if she tries to use them as an emotional weapon against me, or selfishly drags them into all of this, then that would only make me angrier than I already am.

I blocked her from all of my socials. Though I know that this won't be over any time soon, and my Dad is preparing to lawyer up if she does try and drag this to the courts.

But for now I am going to try and re-focus on my GCSE exams, and looking forward to the upcoming trip away with my Dad to celebrate the end of my exams.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA, Really, you did what any sane person would do after years of neglect, and to be honest, you deserve a medal, because it takes a lot of courage to stand up for yourself, and I hope you find a way to move forward with peace of mind and a renewed sense of strength.

>**OOP:** Thankfully my Dad has a big heart, and he has given me the love of two parents :)
I doubt that I'd have the courage to stand up for myself if it wasn't for the way that he's raised me.

**Commenter 2:** NTA. She’s waited 14 years to contact you, while she’s had other kids for what? 7 years? Nah. She could have reached out at any point, the fact that she waited until you’re old enough to babysit is suspicious as hell. You owe her nothing.

> **OOP:** She tried reaching out last year, by contacting my Dad. He spoke to me at the time about it, asked what I wanted to do, and he respected my decision of not wanting anything to do with her.
He gave my response to her, but she's now bypassed him and contacted me directly.

**Downvoted Commenter:** I can't stop wondering who told you the reasons for her leaving. If it's not her I would like to hear the reason from her own mouth.

> **OOP:** She told me herself as a part of her sob story. It was always difficult for my Dad to give an appropriate response whenever I did ask him why she left us. But he did his very best to tell me in an age appropriate way.

**Commenter 3:** NTA, your egg donor wants a free babysitter
> 
> **Commenter 4:** That was my first thought. But the threat of a lump-sum payment of all the back child support she owes should scare her off
> 
> > **OOP:** It might sound silly, but I wouldn't want the back payment on the child support that she owes. I know that it'll probably sound like mental gymnastics, but I feel that accepting her money would give her a reason to believe that she would now have a say in my life.

**Is there any chances that OOP's dad can ask for child support if her 'Mum' is in a better place financially?**

> **OOP:** My Dad isn't struggling for money, and he's been placing money into a fund that I use for uni expenses. And the topic of back payments on child support has come up. But I am reluctant to accept any money from her, as I don't want to give her a reason to believe that she'd now have the right to have a say in my life because we've accepted money from her.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/UQOMosdc6h): **July 6, 2025 (almost two months later)**

This is an update on a post that I made more than a month ago.

For more information, you can find it here AITAH for telling my Mum that I didn't want to know her after she walked out 14 years ago.

But the TL;DR.

I am a 16F, and I am living with my Dad who has 100% sole custody of me. He has had custody since I was 2.

My parents had me when they were both quite young (my Dad was 18 and 'Mum' was 20), and 'Mum' couldn't cope with how my existence and having to be a mum inconvenienced her education and social life. She wanted to enjoy university, going out drinking, and my existence got in the way of all of that. Therefore she upped sticks and left my Dad to raise me by himself.

She's made a few attempts over the last couple of years to reenter my life. Her first attempt she tried through my dad, and when he spoke to me about it, I told him that I didn't want ot know her. He returned that message her.

And the most recent attempt by her occurred the other month. Only this time she bypassed my dad and messaged me directly.

I admittedly blew up at her and took a lot of my frustrations out on her.

Eventually though she respected the fact that I needed to concentrate on my GCSEs and she asked if we could meet up after I was done.

I then spent a while trying to figure out what I should do. I spoke to my dad about it and he gave me his full support on whatever my decision would be.

In the end I did agree to meet my mum in a public place and we met up yesterday at a coffee shop.

My dad dropped me off and I asked him to stay close by to pick me up when I was done, so he went and did a bit of shopping for our upcoming trip away together.

I understand that this is getting to be quite a long ready now, so I will try and keep it as simple as possible.

But basically my mum started giving me an emotional story on how she has spent the last 10+ years regretting not being in my life.

She told me that she was young when she walked out and was really unsure what she wanted in life.

I responded that I can understand that she was young and becoming a mum at her age must've been incredibly difficult.

But I pointed out that my dad was also young, younger than her in fact. But he stepped up and became a single parent, to the detriment of his own future dreams and relationships.

So whilst I could sympathise with her, I still couldn't accept it as being a good enough reason.

I could see that those words really stung her and whilst I knew that she was being genuine, I still couldn't forgive her for that and I did tell her that.

She then informed me that her children (my half siblings) would really like to meet their older sister and she showed me their photos and was telling me stories about their life.

This honestly felt like a stab to the heart. Because a mum talking about her children, sharing photos of them, etc is what I spent my life wanting.

In the end I had to ask her to stop talking about her children. Because hearing these stories was bringing up the pain of the mum that I always wanted but never had.

I also told her that no matter how much she tries, I wouldn't ever see her children as being my siblings. We didn't grow up together and we don't know each other. They are nothing but strangers to me and no different to the children that I see walking past me in the street.

My emotions did get the slight better of me here and my mum did see my agitation growing.

I won't bore you with every thing that was said. But by the time that we were done with our conversation and were getting ready to leave, my mum got the wrong assumption thinking that this wouldn't be the last time that we'd meet up. Because she thanked me for giving her this opportunity to spend time with her eldest daughter and how she hopes that we can continue to heal our relationship.

I had to stop her there, and this is where I am now second guessing on whether I was too harsh.

Because I told her that under false illusion does this mean that we will one day have a mother/daughter relationship.

I only gave her this time with me so that we could both say what needed to be said for the closure that will allow us to move on from each other.

I don't right now and never will I consider her as my mum.

Yes she is the woman who gave birth to me and I will always be thankful to her for how she carried me for 9 months and gave birth to me. However that doesn't mean that I will ever see her as my mum.

She began to get rather emotional at this point, but I just had to ignore her so that I could finish what I wanted to say when I told her that I consider myself as only having one parent, my dad.

And before we went our ways whilst she was still trying to get her emotions under check whilst begging me to reconsider giving her a second chance, I felt that I had to be brutally honest when I requested that she doesn't contact me or my dad again. And that if I ever wanted to speak to her again, that I would be the one to reach out to her.

I'm not heartless. The pain was honestly eating away at me as I watched my mum getting more and more emotional, and I was struggling to keep my own emotions under control. Because I wanted to cry, but I couldn't. I knew that I had to make my message crystal clear to her that I don't want anything to do with her. Not now or any time in the future.

It was only when I met up with my dad and got into the car that I finally broke down and cried hysterically.

My dad has given me his full support. He's reassured me that he'll always respect my decision. Whether I want my mum in my life, whether I want to go LC or completely remove her from my life. He will always support me and I really appreciate his support.

His support has given me reassurances that I've done the right thing. However whilst speaking to my best friends, they've been conflicted on the matter.

They feel that I've been too harsh on my mum and that I should've been more responsive towards repairing a relationship with her. They believe that I should try and give her a second chance otherwise I might one day regret it.

I asked them to change the subject because I didn't want to talk about her anymore. But it did leave me wondering whether I was too harsh on my mum when she was trying to give me a genuine apology for all of her wrong doings. Because she has accepted full responsibility for what she did and that there is nothing that could excuse what she did 14 years ago.

That makes me feel like my friends were right and I was an AH to my mum when we met up. But I am just confused right now.

My dad has offered me the chance of seeing a therapist for everything that I've been through, but I am reluctant.
I am foolishly hoping that once I've been on this holiday with my dad and when we return home, these events with my mum will be in the distant past.

Oh and to finish off.

In my last post, I had a number of comments telling me that my dad should chase my mum for child support.

I did discuss this with my dad, but it's not something that he wants to do.

He says that we're fine financially and he doesn't want to deal with the stress of going through the legal system (which can be slow) and end up in a prolounged legal battle with her.

He's also got concerns that this would maybe give my mum more of incentive to try and forceably be more involved in my life. Because she's now 'invested' money into me and that would give her a legal right to having some form of access to me.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA,

She said she regretted last 10+ not being in your but didn't even contact you even once until now?

She made her bed when she abandoned you, now let her sleep on it.

Actions has consequences.

> **OOP:** She's made a few attempts the last few years. But I always made it clear each time that I didn't want to have contact with her.
> 
> I only agreed to meet up with her yesterday with the intention of telling her that I don't want her in my life regardless of what she had to say.
> 
> But seeing her getting as emotional as she got did hit me in a way that I didn't expect.

**Commenter 2:** Wow talk about throwing it in your face when she describing “Her Children” you know the ones she wanted to be a mother too!

Some things can never be fixed no matter how hard you wish it, and that’s a lesson your egg donor is learning.

> **OOP:** I know that she was just hoping that I might want to have a connection with my half siblings. But it was incredibly hurtful the way that she brought them up in the conversation.
> 
> She could've gone about addressing them to me in a much better way.
> 
> And it's not like I am 100% against the idea of knowing them one day. But I couldn't do it whilst they are still living at home and under the influence of their mum.

**Commenter 3:** Still NTA

If she had regrets 10yrs ago when you were 6, then a mother daughter relationship might have happened if she was introduced to you slowly and you had a chance to build that bond and relationship.

This isn't what's happening here.

She's expecting an almost adult to be falling over yourself at the chance to have a relationship with her and her family, that's why she's already told her kids about 'their big sister' who they are now excited to meet. Any rational person would build a relationship with you first without adding into more people with expectations that you didn't sign up for.

I do think speaking to someone is a good idea. If you're not comfortable with that, journal.

Good luck with your GCSEs! I remember how tough they were.

> **OOP:** That's the really sad thing. Up till around the age of 10-12, I was still hoping for a chance of my mum re-entering my life. And I would've welcomed her back into my life. That little girl inside of me would've forgiven her.
> 
> But I am almost an adult now. My dad has done the hard grafting of raising me and getting me through school.
> 
> My childhood is over and it's too late for her now.
> 
> I am receptive to the possibility of one day forming some kind of a relationship with my half siblings.
> 
> Because I can't hold them to blame for their mum's past behaviour towards me.
> 
> But I couldn't do it before we're all adults and they are no longer under the control of their mum.
> 
> And thank you :)

**Commenter 4:** So at 20 she was too young for a baby but dad wasn't? Your mum wants something. Maybe her new family/in-laws found out about you and questioned how she has no contact? Honestly, you did the absolute right thing for you. You got closure and saw her 1 last time. She had all those wonderful stories about her kids, but she couldn't, most likely, even tell you what your favourite colour is. (Not saying this to hurt but for clarity) She is not your mum she is just the person that gave birth to you. A mum is someone who raises you, sweats, bleeds, and agonized over every decision about you. Worries about you and what you are doing. This woman didn't do any of that, and your dad did/is. Kudos to dad for being a man when he could have run.

> **OOP:** My dad said the same thing.
> 
> My maternal grandparents were both deceased before I was born (which is why they aren't in the picture). But word of my existence probably has got out to her husband's family.
> 
> ""A mum is someone who raises you, sweats, bleeds, and agonized over every decision about you. Worries about you and what you are doing.""
> 
> And this is why I show appreciation towards my dad on both Mother's Day and Father's Day. Because he took on the duty of being both my mother and my father (including certain stages of a daughter's life where a mum is needed).
> 
> He has enough love to ensure that I've never gone without.

**Commenter 5:** NTA. She’s only doing this now bc her younger kids want to know you, and now you’re basically grown, no longer a “burden.” Fuck her.

But your dad should file for child support the week before you turn 18. She owes you that money, you could use it for uni or a house. And once you’re 18, the court can’t force a relationship.

> **OOP:** I do suspect that she used her children to try and 'guilt' me into having a relationship with her via her children.
> 
> She is aware of the fact that I have a soft spot for children and my future career ambition of becoming a pediatrician.

**OOP on her father trying to keep her mother updated on her life**

> **OOP:** My dad would always share updates on my life milestones (first day of school, my birthdays, etc) but she never showed an interest in the updates that my dad would send her. She blanked my entire existence, so birthday & christmas presents from her were never a thing.
> 
> I have had people previously warn me that if I did decide to make a connection with my mum and spend time with her, that it would hurt my dad's feelings. But rest assured, there is nothing that she could offer which would make me want to spend time connecting with her, let alone make me want to choose her over my dad. Because I'm not the only person who she hurt with her selfish actions.
> 
> My dad struggled a lot, and I saw a lot of his struggles whilst I was growing up. He did his best to hide his struggles from me, but I saw them. And every time that I saw he was upset, I would always give my dad a cuddle and a ""i love you"". And I'd always feel a great feeling of happiness when I saw just how happy that made him. I could never forgive the person who caused all those struggles and pain to my dad.
> 
> It's my daily habit. I don't miss a day when it comes to giving my dad a hug and telling him that I love him 🥰

""Get the OR ready. Remove her womb. Make sure it’s done before she wakes.""



The pack healer went rigid with shock.



""Alpha... Remove her womb?!""



""Alpha—you don't have an heir! You do this, the pack will have no heir. The pack elders will never accept it!""



Cassian's voice was ice-cold, devoid of emotion.



""I don’t need an heir from Evelyn Carter. Annabelle delivered my heir yesterday. He will inherit everything. Evelyn’s womb is a threat.""



The healer's face crumpled with disbelief.



""But that boy will carry another man's name, call another man Alpha. After seven miscarriages, The chances of Luna carrying another are barely there.""



Cassian lit a cigarette, his voice bitter.



""Annabelle is my true mate, I’d do anything for her, I don't care some Moon Goddess pairing.""



""Alpha, but—""



""Enough."" He frowned. ""Do it.""



Just as Cassian got up to go, his phone buzzed. He hit speaker by mistake.



""Alpha, got the cash. Hell, after seven jobs, I could do this shit in my sleep. Next time, I’ll wear a vampire disguise—really carve up that Luna's belly—""



""No next time. Take your money and disappear from Moonvale.""



Footsteps approached from deeper inside.



I stumbled back to my room, barely making it to the bed before Cassian entered.



""Evelyn, you're up. When did you wake up?""



Sweat beaded on my forehead as I fought to appear normal.



""Just woke up. You weren't here, so I thought I'd stretch my legs.""



His eyes narrowed slightly, studying my face.



My wolf whimpered with terror. Just when I thought he'd caught me, he scooped me up and settled me back on the bed.



""Baby, you scared the hell out of me. We already lost our pup—I can't handle losing you too.""



He dared to mention our pup.



Thinking of all the puppies he'd murdered, I pressed a hand to my chest as grief threatened to overwhelm me.



Those accidents, the attacks, the fall—all of it orchestrated by my own mate.



""The heal needs to do a follow-up procedure. Just to make sure everything's healing properly.""



""I know losing the baby hurts, but we'll try again. We'll have the most beautiful pup—strong like their Alpha, gentle like their mother.""



Cassian handed me a vial of potion. In the brief moment he turned away, I saw a thick, dark liquid shimmer as something else mixed in and vanished.



He pulled me close, his expression soft with false concern.



But I could see through the mask now. Every gentle touch was a lie.



""Do I really need to drink this? I'm not very thirsty...""



Cassian, you've slaughtered seven of my children. Now you want to steal my very ability to be a mother?



He didn't even pause, stroking my hair with that practiced tenderness.



""Come on, don't be difficult. You need your strength to heal. You want your Alpha to worry himself sick?""



""Let me help you with that.""



He pressed the glass to my lips, his grip firm enough that refusal wasn't an option.



I closed my eyes, each swallow feeling like liquid fire burning down my throat.



As the drugs took hold, I saw the healer slip into the room through my blurring vision.



""Begin immediately. And...""



Cassian's voice dropped to barely a whisper.



""Make sure she can’t walk again.""



Chapter 2



""Alpha, is this really necessary? Isn’t that… a little too cruel?""



""Do it!""



I knew Cassian was always calculating and paranoid, but I never imagined that just seeing me awake early would push him to such cruelty.



My puppy, my chance at motherhood, and now even my ability to walk—he was taking everything.



Cassian, is this how you treat the mate the Moon Goddess chose for you?



My wolf howled inside me, wild and silent with fury.



I screamed silently in despair, struggling to sit up, but the darkness pulled me deeper.



As the anesthesia began to wear off, I heard the healer's voice through the haze:



""Alpha, her womb has been removed. And... she'll never walk again.""



Cassian's voice was filled with satisfaction. ""Good. Perfect.""



When I fully awakened, tears were falling onto my hands—his tears, so convincingly real.



""Evelyn, the healer says infection damaged your womb. You'll never be able to have children.""



I ignored him, frantically trying to move my legs.



Nothing. No sensation at all.



I broke down completely, sobbing as I demanded:



""Cassian, what did you do to my legs?""



Tears streamed down his face, his voice breaking with practiced grief.



""There were complications with the anesthesia. You're paralyzed from the waist down.""



""Don't be scared, baby... no matter what happens, I'll never leave you. I'll always love you.""



I'd never realized what a gifted actor my mate was.



He dismissed the nurses, personally feeding me soup, cleaning my body, even tending to the post-surgical bleeding himself.



He worked tirelessly until evening, then kissed my forehead tenderly.



""You've suffered so much for our pack. I promise I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.""



I studied his exhausted face, then looked away coldly.



""You should rest if you're tired.""



""I'll stay right here with you. Just call if you need anything.""



Once he was asleep, I reached for his second phone.



I'd always known about Cassian's other device—his ""work phone""—but had never thought to check it.



The password worked on the first try.



Annabelle's birthday.



The lock screen showed their wedding photo.



A wedding photo... He'd married her in secret. The white dress seared my eyes.



With trembling fingers, I opened his messages. He called her ""baby"" in every text.



Endless conversations that grew more horrifying with each scroll.



Every business trip had been a lie—excuses to be with her.



All those times I'd been hurt that he never came to my doctor appointments.



When physicians asked about the Alpha, I'd smile awkwardly and say he was busy with Alpha duties.



His standard response was always the same:



""I’ve been tied up with pack affairs. Check-ups aren't a big deal—I'd just be in the way. You can handle routine things yourself.""



But he'd attended every single one of Annabelle's prenatal appointments. No matter how busy, he never missed one.



He wrote about how excited he was for their child, calling them the most precious thing in his world.



Scrolling further, my heart shattered completely.



Every time I got pregnant, they planned how to kill my child.



Even the car accident from a year ago—Annabelle had been behind the wheel.



She'd said she wanted to experience the thrill of hitting someone. Cassian had eagerly agreed.



His only instruction: ""Try not to kill her outright.""



They discussed hurting me and murdering my children as casually as commenting on the weather.



My nails dug into my palms until blood dripped between my fingers.



The photo album contained thousands of pictures—all of Annabelle. Candid shots, selfies together, morning scenes, walks, intimate dinners where he'd prepared special meals for her pregnancy...



There were 99+ videos. I switched to that section and felt ice water flood my veins.



Countless recordings of their intimate moments, like they were documenting every encounter.



Even role-playing scenarios that made my stomach turn.



I pressed my hand to my mouth, fighting nausea.



But worse were six videos labeled ""First,"" ""Second,"" all the way to ""Sixth.""



Realizing what they contained, bile rose in my throat as blood filled my mouth.



Chapter 3



I bit down hard on my lip and opened the sixth video.



Cassian and Annabelle were laughing together.



In front of them lay...my unboren puppy.



The blade might as well have been cutting into my own flesh. My wolf howled in agony, the pain causing my stomach to cramp violently.



I couldn't hold back anymore, leaning over the bed rail as dry heaves wracked my body.



I didn't sleep that night, my wolf pacing restlessly in my mind as tears soaked through my hospital gown.



The next morning, Cassian brought me breakfast as usual—an elaborate spread he'd personally selected.



Pancakes, fresh fruit, coffee, pastries...



I'd once thought this was his way of showing love. Now I knew it was just thoughtless guilt, buying his way out of actually caring.



Remembering the videos, I dry heaved again.



Seeing my distress, Cassian's expression filled with concern:



""Still feeling sick? Damn it, this is all my fault. I hate seeing my mate like this.""



""I'm fine. I want to go home.""



Something flickered across Cassian's face—a moment of tension.



""You just lost another pup. My mother isn't... handling it well. If you go back to the pack house now, you'll just walk into a shitstorm. Maybe we should wait until things cool down.""



I said nothing, but his expression told me everything I needed to know.



That afternoon, while he was gone, I packed my things and wheeled myself to the pack house.



I rolled through the front door to find Annabelle curled up in Cassian's lap, both of them cooing over a baby whose scent carried unmistakable traces of Graves bloodline.



Margaret emerged from the kitchen with a bowl of bone broth, personally feeding Annabelle spoonful by spoonful.



The three of them looked like the perfect family unit.



The moment Margaret caught my scent, her eyes flashed with her wolf's displeasure.



""Well, well. Look what crawled back to the den. You've got some nerve showing your face here after what you've done.""



""My Alpha son treats you like a precious mate, and this is how you repay him? Another dead heir. You're cursed, and you're bringing that curse into our pack!""



""Annabelle is the one deserves to be Luna of the Moonvale Pack. Get out of my territory—you're poison to this pack.""



Annabelle followed Margaret's gaze to me, her eyes glittering with the triumph:



""Luna Margaret, don't be so harsh. What if Evelyn gets upset and starts spreading lies about Alpha and me to the other packs?""



""Let her try. No pack leader gives a damn what a barren she-wolf has to say.""



I knew Margaret had always despised me. She thought I was too headstrong for an Alpha's mate, too independent—that I'd challenge her son's authority instead of submitting properly.



Annabelle was everything she wanted: beautiful, submissive, making Cassian the center of her universe like a proper Luna should.



She'd only wanted Annabelle as her son's mate, but then Annabelle married into another pack, and I'd given up everything to be the perfect Alpha's mate.



Margaret had reluctantly accepted me into the pack.



But years of failed pregnancies had pushed her resentment to the breaking point.



Now that Annabelle was back—with Cassian's heir—Margaret felt free to unleash every bit of venom she'd been storing.



If only she knew that every one of those lost pups had been orchestrated by her beloved Alpha.



Every grandchild she'd mourned had been murdered by the woman she was now treating like precious pack treasure.



In the past, Cassian would have used his Alpha command to intervene. Now he sat there holding Annabelle's child, acting like he couldn't hear a word.



Annabelle nestled deeper into his arms:



""Cassian, you're paying more attention to the pup than to me. Your wolf is making mine jealous.""



Cassian's expression melted with adoration as he nuzzled her neck, scenting her:



""You know you're my true mate. But look what I have for you.""



I followed Annabelle's delighted gaze to a document on the coffee table: ""Pack Territory Transfer Agreement.""



""Oh my God, Cassian! You're giving me pack lands?""



She kissed the corner of his mouth, shooting me a triumphant look over his shoulder.



I smiled back coldly, my wolf finally going still in my mind.



Enjoy it while you can.



Soon enough, you and your precious Alpha will be crawling back to me, begging.

1lyjapg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteriesRP/comments/1lyjapg/a_day_off/,A day off,"After arriving in Poster City, I hadn’t had any fun. My days were filled with missions or attempts to develop myself. With the tournament approaching, I needed a break—to explore the city and, along the way, maybe even act a bit like a normal person.

First of all, I needed new clothes. A woman wouldn’t just wear the single dark cloak I had. While doing the last mission, I saw a small boutique—the kind of shop where you don’t have to pay with your liver.

Inside, a kind old woman, around sixty years old, was counting the money in the cash register. Apparently, the business wasn’t very profitable. When she looked at me, she immediately asked what I needed, but in her eyes, it felt like she was already thinking it would be a waste of time.

The most honest answer would’ve been something like “I don’t know,” but I couldn’t appear like a poor woman who doesn’t even know what she wants. So, the words that left my mouth were simply:  
“Give me some recommendations. I can spend around six pounds.”

As soon as I said that, the seller’s expression changed instantly—this time, with greed.  
“I’ll go get some dresses. Daily wear, I suppose.”

While she was gone, I walked around the boutique, looking for anything nice—maybe a perfume or something like that. After about 20 minutes, she came back with a huge pile of clothes: a beautiful two-piece blue cotton dress that matched my eyes perfectly, a simple pair of black shoes, three pairs of underwear in different colors, a slightly lighter blue bonnet, and white gloves.

“The total is six pounds and ten soli, but if you buy a perfume, I can round it all to seven pounds.”  
She said this while holding the only perfume I had already smelled and liked.

After paying and spending a suspiciously long time changing clothes, I was finally ready to explore the city.

The first place I visited was a bakery. It was around noon, and I hadn’t eaten anything since last night at the bar. The bakery was owned by someone called “Bread Boy”—a strange name, admittedly, but the place itself was charming. Cozy and inviting, it felt like somewhere you could easily lose track of time. The only downside was the limited menu: just bread and drinks—bread with butter, jelly, and a few other variations.

Still craving something sweet, but not something ordinary, I decided to visit The Café at the End. I had been there before, but last time I just read some books. This time, I wanted something different.

Upon arrival, the local cat was sleeping between the bookshelves, while the bartender—who looked like he knew every secret of every customer—was preparing someone’s coffee. Strangely, the cat now gave off the same aura as the bartender. Once I reached the counter, I ordered vanilla ice cream, and the bartender’s eyes sparkled with recognition. The best part of this place was that if the owner knew a secret, he never shared it.

The rest of my afternoon was spent reading random books, petting the cat, and ordering more ice cream.

Back in my hotel room, I faced the sad truth that I had spent all my savings in a single day. Now I finally understood why women love spending money so much—the feeling really is wonderful. The only thing I need to focus on now is the upcoming tournament. If I win, money won’t be a problem for a few months.",2,1752378673.0,LordofTheMysteriesRP,0,1.0,False

He's yhe type to say or do something very hurtful and get upset that you're upset ""It's just a joke!"", then give an hour long lecture about how you shouldn't be so sensitive.

My father has occasionally done this thing where he puts his mouth on me and my siblings' ankle or hand and sort of blows a bit? He does it to surprise us, maybe he's trying to mimic an animal? Idk. He would laugh so hard even when no one else is.

But the three times he's done this I would get so extremely upset. Utter shock and horror overwhelms me, and I sort of black out (may not be the right term?) a little? I rush to the bathroom, sobbing and hyperventilating and I wash that portion of skin until it's red. Even then it doesn't feel clean.

I'm sobbing uncontrollably and I don't know why. I don't know why I feel so violated, it wasn't even that bad of an action. 

The thing is, I overreact whenever my skin touches him at all. Sometimes he tries to surprise me by suddenly putting his hands on my shoulders from behind, or shouting suddenly by my ear. 

And every time, I get so upset and I have to control myself from breaking down. 

I don't drink coffee or take any medication.

1lyj30x,https://v.redd.it/9bhox0ldbkcf1,Anyone knows about this problem?? [Delonghi Dedica arte 885],"Hi everyone,

I recently purchased a second-hand Dedica Arte machine from Facebook marketplace and have been testing it out, but I’ve run into a couple of issues.

First, when pulling a shot, a few drops of espresso come out first before the actual extraction begins.
This seemed unusual, so I searched for videos of others using the same machine, and none of them had this issue.
I thought it might be a settings problem, so I performed a factory reset following the manual.
I also used the finest grind setting (Baratza Encore) and tamped firmly, but the issue still persists.

Second, the machine extracts an unusually large amount of espresso.
When dosing around 14g of coffee, it pulls about 70–80g of espresso, which seems excessive.

Since it’s my first time using this machine, I’m not sure if the issue lies with the machine or if I’ve set something up incorrectly.
However, the first problem seems clearly related to the machine itself.

I’d really appreciate any advice or insights on what could be causing these problems.",2,1752377976.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1lyj0q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/expo/comments/1lyj0q8/what_if_linkedin_had_a_lets_grab_coffee_button/,What if LinkedIn had a “Let’s grab coffee” button?,"Hey folks,
I’m building out a concept called #LinkDate — something I think solves a gap in professional networking.

🧠 The idea:

> If LinkedIn had a button that said “Let’s meet for coffee” — and it connected you with nearby professionals based on interests, calendar availability, and intent (networking, mentoring, freelancing or maybe professional date 😁).



So instead of endlessly “connecting” online and ghosting, you'd meet like-minded people IRL — startup founders, devs, designers, freelancers — anyone in your professional orbit.


📊 I shared this on LinkedIn and got early signals:

256 impressions

8 likes

10 votes on a poll:

5 said “will try”

5 said “maybe try”

0 said “no”



That’s not product-market fit — but it’s not rejection either.
I’m now trying to validate this beyond LinkedIn’s bubble.


Would love your take:

Would you ever use a tool like this?

For what kind of connections?

What would make you actually meet someone?


If you’re interested in testing or shaping this, drop a comment or DM — I’m gathering feedback before building a focused MVP.

Thanks for reading!

🔥 Evenings are for cozying up together by the fire, sharing quiet conversations they don’t always get time for at home. By day they’re hiking scenic trails, fishing in clear lakes, and exploring all the beauty Granite Falls has to offer.

📸 They’ve been snapping photos to remember it all, but Haruki says his favorite part is just being with Aiko—no chores, no crying toddler, no responsibilities except making each other smile.

Went like this as a reminder:
AJ: I did like having someone home all the time, like Marie would bring me coffee (etc). 
Brittney: There was a period before my (business), what was I like before then?
AJ: You did everything. Breakfast, lunch dinner, everything was always cleaned and taken care of. I know that person is still inside you somewhere.

Was in shock how calmly Brittney handled this - if a partner of mine truly believed that and said that to me it'd be over. Am I being crazy? Haven't seen anyone else mention it on this thread and bothers me this was skated over

My challenge with jumping in on the medium format,  if I increase the shots, I want to do it at home. I have access to a lab that can develop and print, but I would much rather do it myself. Development is pretty straightforward. Scans on the other side, it’s not like 135 film where a plethora of good options exist and at a reasonable price. 

My idea was scan everything, host and archive. From those, print the ones I feel tell a story. Or print a book and quite literally tell the story. 

I like the fact that nowadays we have great technologies, and can keep the best of both worlds. Follow a process to capture the images, keep them all digitally and the preferred ones can live on the coffee table, around the house or hell, I’ve seen them printed on canvas as well. 

Would love to hear your ideas.

1lyir6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1lyir6o/do_you_have_consistent_perfect_conditions_for/,"Do you have consistent ""perfect conditions"" for productivity, or does it change day by day?","I am trying to figure out if my situation is normal or not.
 
Basically, every day it seems I require different conditions to be productive (working/studying).
I have been paying attention to contributing factors such as diet, physical exercise, mental state, light and temperature, caffeine, sitting vs standing, how long my sessions are, how much sleep I get, etc. I've been experimenting a lot to find what feels good, but it always changes. 

For example: one day I'll do a light workout, then put on a cozy sweater and drink a coffee, and I can sit and work for a few hours at a time in the morning with the pomodoro method. All good. 
The next day, that routine will not work for me at all; I wake up with no energy to work out, the warm sweater makes me fall asleep in my chair, the caffeine doesn't help at all, I can't make it to the next time chunk without needing a break, and then after struggling for the first half of the day I suddenly get a burst of energy in the late afternoon/evening. I stay up late to capitalize on it, but then it just throws everything off for the next day. 

I guess it's not entirely a bad thing to just be in tune with myself and adapt as needed, but it's kind of exhausting that I can't just do my routine on autopilot. Plus it's demoralizing that I can't seem to get the same amount of work done every week. I'd love to know what other people's experiences are in creating their ""perfect conditions"". Have you got your needs down to a science? If so, how did you do it? If not, how do you cope? Is it a bad thing that I can't find consistency?

It feels like I waste so much time playing detective with my own mind/body, but at the same time I can't just force myself to study when the conditions aren't right. If you've read this far and you know what I mean, please let me know I'm not alone. Thanks. ",2,1752376888.0,selfimprovement,1,1.0,False
1lyir2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lyir2e/i_f_31_believe_my_husband_33_m_is_having_an_affair/,I (F 31) believe my husband (33 M) is having an affair.,"Edit: anytime I refer to the coworker, he is supposed to be a male.

Hello,

I have been with my husband for 15 years, married for 3. We have 2 children (4 and 2). 

He has begun working 5 hours away on the weekends for over a year now. He has a teaching position and it is great extra income since I am a stay at home mom (and am completely financially dependent on him)

I believe he's having an affair with a woman in this city he's working in, but he is denying it heavily.

This is what has happened over the last year (and tonight) that has really solidified my hunch, but again I have no concrete proof so please let me know what you think:

1. 1 year ago I found a woman's shirt wrapped in the arm sleeve of his sweater in his luggage after he came home from his trip. He did have a friend with him and ""claims"" his friend hooked up with someone and has no idea how it got there. I felt extremely uneasy about that... why was it in his sweater?

2. A few people began commenting on all of his videos (he posts YouTube content and Instagram content) and after I clicked the profiles, they are both from that city and he is also following them.

3. I get an email notification saying a woman has joined our Google family and is using our YouTube premium. Of course it's the girl commenting/liking everything for months from that city. I lost my shit and he cried saying I'm making things stressful and that he's out here working for our family and she is a friend of the guy he is working with. He also begins ""staying"" at this guys house for free accommodations, since he has a 3 bedroom and said it was OK 

4. A few months ago I found a coffee cup in the back of our car with his name on it, a mocha latte (which he would never get, he only drinks black coffee) and lip stick all over it. I question him and he claims he has no clue where it came from. At this point I told him I'm struggling to trust him and believe he is having an affair on me. He breaks down crying again saying he is not. Still cant tell me where the cup came from. Says he ordered coffee for his coworker and himself.

5. This is the final series of events that have me spiraling. My 4 y/o underwent a series of tests at a hospital and as a treat my husband said he'd take him to the city because our 4 y/o has been begging to go. He has a great time, stays at a high rise condo that my husband said his coworker invited them to stay at. They come home and my husband sends me a bunch of really cute photos of things they did. My husband goes back to work the next day(stupid to take our 4yo and come back just to leave the following day, I didnt understand that part, but wasnt going to spoil it for my 4 y/o)

Husband says his coworker is getting a new phone contract and that he needs a new phone so is going to pay out the 350 he owes. I say great (he did need one). He comes home and I find a handwritten note in our car about a phone plan, including how much it is per month, and a number registered to that city. It was woman's handwriting. Again, he has no clue where it came from... i call the number anonymously and it was declined goes to voixemail but the voicemail is automated so idk whose number it is.

Here's the finale: I'm putting our 4 y/o to bed tonight and he was going through my pictures. Pulls up the pics from his trip with daddy and starts telling me all about it. He says him, daddy, and mickie were doing everything together. There's a photo of my son and this man who I thought this whole time was mickie. I said oh is this mickie? Did you guys have fun? 

He tells me ""no mom, mickie is a girl""...

I ask whose house they stayed at and he told me mickie's house.

You guys know the girl I was concerned about? Guess what her middle name is on her Instagram handle..... you got it. Mickie.



Fuck. Ive been shaking. Im disgusted. 

Do all of these add up?

1lyiq8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Zandalf_the_Blue/comments/1lyiq8d/black_coffee/,Black Coffee,"
   Possession can take many forms. Thanks to Hollywood Humans have a pretty good grasp on the basics. It primarily involves a person, animal or object. In many cases it’s easiest to possess whatever is near or the focal point of negativity. The abused and neglected child desperate and vulnerable, the home that has housed decades of family trauma and violence or the doll that is simply a witness to it all. For a Demon it’s far more than just a chance to torment and drag an unlucky soul back into the fires. It’s an opportunity. A chance to prove to all of Hell what you can do while also being able to escape it for as long as you can. The closest thing we have to a miracle.

  I’d introduce myself but my name is unpronounceable by man and I wouldn’t even know where to begin with spelling it. To be honest I haven’t heard it in so long I sometimes forget it. I am a lower ranking demon only permitted in the less actiony sides of Hell. I don’t get to see to the torture of the damned or anything fun. I mainly herd souls and preform the bidding of the higher ranks. Subject to abuse and carrying out tasks no one wants to do like making sure the rivers continue to flow and aren’t being too clogged up from all the bodies stacking up and thrashing desperately in the current. 

   Today Ive been tasked with breaking up large ice formations from relentless rains here in Beelzebub’s territory. One of the most horrifically uncomfortable lords to speak with but I stay on his good side by having an offering ready for every meet. He might not love what you have to offer but he’s not exactly picky either. I watch the damned roam aimlessly through the storm while I chip away at the ice. Eyes frozen shut with the fierce winds peeling back their frostbitten flesh exposing the blackening muscle and bone beneath. If the ice formations get too large the humans will use them to try and escape the elements. Pointless really. I chuckled to myself at their expense. I hacked away at the ice revealing long abandoned fingers, limbs and strips of faces past souls weren’t able to free from the structure’s cold grip. That was when I saw it. A glimmering thread appeared from nowhere just in-front of me.

   These threads are doorways so to speak. A bridge to something from the mortal plane that is essentially available for possession. Exceptionally rare especially in these parts and just within arms reach.. it was beautiful. “HEY”! I snapped my head around. “Don’t you fucking move, Imp”. I had stared for too long, I should’ve known higher ranking demons would be alerted and drawn to its location. I froze, my whole body clenched and vibrating violently with fear and excitement of what could be. If I were to disobey I can’t imagine the suffering I would endure. Once I was through though who could reach me?

   My head felt heavy at the thought but my eyes were forcing my focus on the thread. It’s right here! Right in front of me! The opportunity and escape I’ve yearned for, for centuries. I couldn’t ignore this moment, I had to take the chance and finally become everything I knew I could be. I inhaled sharply and quickly grasped the thread and with my last sight being the absolute rage of the demon rushing towards me everything went dark.

   I felt light as I regained my consciousness. Floating in a pool of blackness when I began to hear distant mumbling. It slowly grew louder, less muffled as I opened my eyes. It was bright and took a moment to focus. “What is.. Where am I?” I looked ahead at a man staring back at me with frustration in his eyes. “COME ON!” He gave a short but forceful shove into me. “Damn thing never works right.” He stormed off. “What the fuck was that about?” I asked myself. I took a moment to focus and learn what I had become a part of. As the full picture of my possession came into view my jaw dropped. “No…NO!…. NO NO NO, FUCK!” It wasn’t true, it couldn’t be! My heart raced with confusion, panic and sheer embarrassment as my situation became more and more clear to me…. It was a coffee machine… I have possessed a God damned coffee machine.

   After a few hours or so of trying to calm myself down I was able to look around and listen to people coming and going and have  drawn the full unfortunate picture of my situation. I am now a large coffee machine in the break room of some machine company. Bearings I think is what I heard they make here. “It’s fine, this is fine” I thought. “I’ll just bail! Return to Hell and explain myself.. They’ll probably all laugh!”But I knew this wouldn’t be the case. 

   To back out of a possession was considered dishonorable. Not that honor exists where I’m from but it was looked at as failure or cowardice. Should I return I’d be subject to tortures and humiliations far worse than what most humans receive. I was stuck here in the decision I’ve made. My thoughts were interrupted by another man staring at me blankly deciding on what type of coffee he wanted. He pressed A3 and a lukewarm black coffee was dispensed. He took a sip, let out a unsatisfied sigh and left. “Maybe… maybe there’s hope here” I thought. It’s not what I had envisioned but there is opportunity here. I just needed to think. “These people… drink from me. I can dictate what they ingest.. I can have a direct effect on them internally!.. Not sure where it could go from there but it’s something”. With this clarity I’ve decided to stick it out and have gained a new excitement for what could be. 

  The first work break of the day has started. A few people sitting around at the lunch tables rambling about their pathetic lives and what a shithole place they think this is. Finally my first target has approached me. An older fat woman breathing heavily and biting her disgusting nails as she looked over her options. “We really need more options in this ol thang”. She chose E4, a cappuccino. Admittedly I was caught off guard a little. I was so taken back by this putrid ogre I hadn’t even thought of a plan for the drink. Quickly I allowed many small and sharp, hair sized, shards of plastic to peel from the dispenser into her coffee. In time my strength will grow but for now it’s the best I can muster. I was so excited watching her I didn’t realize I was holding my breath as she walked back to her table. She took a few sips each one followed by a low grunt clearing her throat. The grunts grew louder and were eventually followed by coughs that became too rough for her to ignore. At this point the whole break room had taken notice. “Excu- *cough* excuse me” she said standing up quickening her pace to the restroom. She placed a hand on the door and coughed a wonderful red and brown mist all down the face of it. 

   A few jumped out of their seats while most seemed stunned or unable to register what had happened. Her knees buckled, she gripped her stomach and let out a gasp that sounded as if her lungs were filled with rust and spit. Her forehead hit the floor while she unleashed a painful broken up shriek like a toddler. Two men grabbed her up and ran her out the door frantically with trickles of muddy crimson behind them. Just like that the room had gone from chaos to silence with nothing but the confused and terrified faces of her coworkers. Sweet ecstasy in my veins.

   By lunch time I’ve found out the ogre woman had been rushed to the hospital. No word on her condition but I hope for the worst. Some are still worried but things went back to normal here pretty quickly. The janitor had cleaned the mess and it became just a story. Gossip for these oblivious apes. It was when I heard someone mention it could’ve been the cappuccino that I decided to change up my strategy. I want to stick around here and perhaps the best way to do that is to make people actually enjoy their coffees. That’ll ensure my progress. Unfortunately word about the cappuccino got to higher ups and the next day an inspector had come to check the machine. I made sure to have the inside spotless as if brand spanking new. So much so that the inspector looked puzzled as to why he’d even been called. Supervisors gave the ok and the workers were back to ordering their drinks again. Lucky for them I knew exactly how to keep them coming back.

   Three days have passed since inspection and business has been booming. So many delighted faces ordering, pressing their gnarled oily fingers against the console grinning ear to ear. Some coming back three to four times a day even. It’s all thanks to an extra little ingredient. Enough time has passed for me to have grown a bit stronger and allow me to reach into Hell for resources to help aid me. Nothing major but I’ve found that I can acquire liquids. In this case, the blood of aborted fetuses and infants fresh from Moloch’s mountain. 

   A breathtaking sight to behold, I’ll show it to your goofy mustached ass when you get down here after reading. The babies plummet into Hell slamming down onto each other and the hot jagged rocks blistering their skin as the blood is continuously pulled from them down the mountain feeding into Moloch’s moats. I had always been attracted to their pain the most. Older children and adults are able to relate their pain. Should they be impaled on hot iron they’re aware of what is happening. They understand the source and feeling of their torture. Infants however are unique in their suffering. 

   They can’t process or avoid the pain let alone form a single intelligent thought as to what is happening and why. It is the purest form of anguish there is. The blood of a tortured infant also has rejuvenating effects. Makes you feel and look younger and just happier in general. Humans with power and influence love to partake in its effects but are unaware of how rapidly it rots the already condemned soul. They’re basically stomping on the gas pedal to eternal damnation just to feel a bit more energetic. Even better it’s far more addicting than any drug and the withdrawals are immediate. Ever seen an extremely attractive celebrity look shockingly old and worn out seemingly overnight? Well now you know. 

  “Hey hurry the hell up, Tom” Joe yelled from the back of the line. “I’m goin I’m goin just give me a second! Now do I want the espresso.. or cappuccino.. orrr..” Tom mumbled. Joe is one of my favorites here. Ex military, extremely short tempered and paranoid. Blames it on his years of service even though he never stepped foot into a combat zone. He spends most of his day sucking on his tongue looking for what other people are doing wrong. And Tom! Sweet simple Tom. A knuckle dragging slob whose mind moves slower than his feet. A big softy. Susan steps in: “knock it off you two it’s not goin nowhere”. The company’s token sweet old lady who can’t help but make the occasional racist remark here and there. The janitor is an interesting one too. Deeply religious and lately I’ve seen him nervously fiddle with the small crucifix around his neck whenever he enters the room. God had gifted man with a sense for danger that they  like to call gut feelings. Such a simple and powerful thing yet the majority of them simply ignore it and go on to ruin their lives or others’. 

   With every cup they consume I can feel myself connecting with them more and more. Not enough to take full control but enough to follow and observe them within the building. Joe however I’ve easily built an influence on. His depression and anger practically served as a damn welcome mat. I like to make him uncomfortably warm and forget where he would place things now and then. Small things that build up in an attempt to spark some violence. Nothing yet but he’ll snap, he just needs more time. Now that I’ve essentially created a building of addicts it’s time to shake things up. I’ve brought the temperature of the coffees down to just barely passable as warm and have completely replaced the infant blood with swamp water from Aeshma’s circle. 

   Filled with the blood, sweat, bile and waste from hateful souls condemned to endlessly beat each other to the death they wish would come but never arrives. Obviously I’ve tweaked the flavor to make it more tasteful but it should help to liven things up around here. The first to partake in this new blend is Frankie. A new father of twins and without paid paternity leave is forced to work all day while facing sleepless nights at home. A perfect cocktail of frustration and exhaustion. “Ughh what the fuck dude” he dumped his cup and hit to refill hoping it was just a bad batch but was pissed and saddened to taste the same result. “Damnit man, I was really looking forward to this.”

   Disappointment all around this morning. 
Tempers are beginning to flare as some curse the company and supervisors names. Around the building you could see how sluggish and upset everyone was. I decided to spend time with Sasha, a somewhat new hire. She’d always stop by to order hot tea or the decaf options. Who the hell gets a decaf coffee by the way?.. Anyways.. 
She was still training on these machines, Bihlers they’re called. Massive machines meant to cut and shape metals of various thicknesses. She’s got the hang of it but today is special. She is tired, agitated and unfocused making simple mistakes. 

   The machine is running, pulling a long strip of steel into it at a quick rate. I’ve had her overthinking this job and just as she was about to step back I forced her head in the direction of a small piece of tape on the line traveling towards the Bihler. I leaned forward into her ear and softly whispered: “If you don’t remove the tape in time it will ruin this job and the tooling in the machine”. She lunged forward without a thought gripping the tape but before she could rip it off the speed and pull of the line yanked her arm into the machine’s flattener. 

   Seven large metal wheels gripped her finger tips crushing and splintering the bones as her arm was passed from one to another. Skin flattening, ballooning and popping open to release blasts of blood and muscle as the bone ripped its way through any available openings it could find. Her screams filled every nook and corner of the building until she was elbow deep into the hungry machine. Instead of feeding in straight now the mashed mess of what was once her arm is being fed downward forcing her further in until her upper torso was forced sideways through the small opening in the side. Her raspy wails were silenced in an instant as her neck was snapped and her face imbedded into the opposite shoulder. The lead operator had finally reached the emergency stop button but it was far too late. It took only seconds. 

   It’s been sometime since anyone’s been called back into work. Past few days have been only police, managers and clean up crews trying to piece together what had happened. On camera it’s clearly a horrific case of operator error but it’s also been discovered that the machines error sensors had been turned off at some unknown point in time. Had they still been on she would’ve only lost a hand or some fingers. Management keeps pointing out her actions clearly more concerned about the potential lawsuit than saddened by the young woman’s death. Seems the case will be getting wrapped up soon. It’s been far too quiet and boring here. My mind wanders thinking of the workers. What they’re doing and what I could plan for them upon their return. 

   I thought of Frankie probably relieved to have time at home. A bummer really. He was getting to such a low point, so vulnerable. My mouth salivated at how close I was to taking him next but now who knows. I started hearing muffled voices. I had started to wish the police would move on elsewhere but.. it wasn’t their voices. When I opened my eyes I was stunned to see that I was standing over Frankie in his own home! He was rocking one crying child while the wife fed another. Before I had a chance to take it all in I was back in the coffee machine. Back in that silent cold colorless room. I began laughing. A quiet chuckle that quickly grew into hysterical euphoria. My body shook with the excitement with the realization of how far I’ve come in my work. Though he’s had time at home Frankie has yet to gain any real rest and I had completely forgotten the withdrawals he must be feeling on top of everything else. The bridge isn’t strong enough yet but I’m so close. I clinched my fist tightly and began to drool “you’re mine.. all of you”.

   It’s been nine days since Sasha’s death and everyone has returned to work. Many upset saying it’s far too soon and distasteful considering what happened but when a major companies losing millions sooner or later they’re going to crack that whip. Seems the Janitor quit too! Suppose he listened to that gut of his. It’s a shame though, I really wanted him. There’s a beautiful smell in the air this morning. Everyone scowling, pissed as hell, ready to go into a rage from the swamp water and extreme fatigue from blood withdrawal. I’ve changed nothing with the swamp mix other than serving some cold and others scalding hot. The smallest inconveniences can drive many to their breaking point. 

   Two fist fights have already happened in the parking lot and one worker, Ray, has been in a screaming match with HR and a supervisor. I’ll have to check in on that later. Frankie is walking this way and I see a golden opportunity with having just poured Susan a boiling hot green tea. As the two begin walking towards each other down the hall I blocked her from his view and quickly lifted his hand outward. In one swift motion Frankie not only palmed Susan’s entire right breast but also delivered a hard shove forcing her into the wall. Susan yelled as she tried to catch herself: “what the hell are you doing pervert”? Frankie was almost too surprised to speak. “Nn.. what? where did you come from? I- I didn’t mean- “
Susan interrupted “you just assaulted me you damn pig” she delivered a weak but quick slap to his left cheek. Frankie snapped back “fuck you, you old goat, no one would ever want to touch your disgusting raisin ass body”! Susan then threw her tea into Frankie’s face and marched away as he dropped to one knee burying his face into his shirt screaming. Frankie had to be driven to the hospital while Susan was fired shortly after. 

   After a long drawn out argument with the supervisors Susan stormed out of the building and climbed into her car unaware that I was tagging along. She sped down the interstate ranting to herself “stupid arrogant assholes.. thirty eight fucking years I gave that company!! They wouldn’t be anything without me those damned fools”! With a hard blink she was no longer in her car. Susan was now standing in a void. Blackness and silence in every direction other than her own echoed breathing. She stepped forward, surprised at the small splash from her foot. The shallow liquid under her feet was as black as the space around her. 

   In a low heavy sigh I breathed her name aloud. “Susan..” She spun around releasing a mix between a gasp and shriek. “Wha… who’s there?.. Where am I”? 
“Its alright Susan, everything’s going to be ok…. You’re home now”. Hundreds of tar soaked pruning arms tore out of the abyss beneath her grabbing onto her with the intensity of someone drowning, desperately trying to lift themselves over whatever they could for a single breath. Her screams and struggles were pointless as the overwhelming hoard of arms pulled her down slowly. Shoulder deep at this point with every inch of her covered by hands digging their cracked nails into her flesh, hair and clothing. She managed to look up and gazed into my eyes staring back down at her. I placed a finger on her forehead and delivered a gentle push down. Tears streamed down her face and her muffled whimpers were silenced as she sank below the surface. Susan gasped awake back behind the wheel of her car on the interstate and collided with an oncoming sixteen wheeler at ninety three miles an hour. There was nothing left.

   Back at work not much has changed. We’re early into the next morning and things are slow. A police officer, a detective, a company supervisor and some fancy suit are all speaking at one of the tables. “I can assure you gentleman nothing is out of the ordinary here. We’re running as smoothly as ever! All of theeeeese… incidents are just unfortunate luck”. 
The detective spoke: “incidents? Mr Fuller two of your employees have died. Another two are in the hospital, three are missing and the rest are frighteningly angry! All within a month! Now maybe this IS all just a hell of a bad luck streak or something very serious is going on here”.
The officer looked over: “Y’all do work with a lot of hazardous chemicals here. Maybe it’s having a violent effect on the workers”? 

   The fancy suit stood up with a sigh and made his way over to the coffee machine. I smirked. Here’s another tally mark for the scoreboard. The detective called to him: “getting bored of the conversation, sir”? The suit chuckled: “Bored of you three maybe. But no this whole thing has caught quite a bit of attention back at base”. 
Mr Fuller was sweating making sure not to say anything that could bring suspicion on the company. The detective leaned back: “I’m sure we’ll get to the bottom of it, sir”. 
“Oh I’m sure you will. I’ll be keeping an eye on your work, detective”. The suit said looking back. A tall pale man, he wore a confident half smile and had the calmest expression while looking over the drink options. “We’ve been watching your progress you know. Impressive stuff”. He pressed H3, French vanilla coffee. I wanted this mortal for sure so I made sure to heavy up the dosage of tortured fetal blood along with an alluring fragrance found in the iron briar patches of Asmodeus. 

   He took a large gulp a released a satisfied exhale. “Damn good coffee. Tastes just like home.. am I right”? He looked up making direct eye contact with me. I froze. “There’s no way.. is .. does he see me”? I looked behind him, the others were like mannequins. The clock on the wall, the birds outside the window. All frozen in time. “Hey relax in there, I just thought I’d swing by and pay a visit. It’s been a long time since I’ve been so eager to see someone’s next move”. He made his way to the window looking out at what might as well have been a photograph. He took another large sip from his coffee. “I knew I had better keep an eye on you after seeing you blatantly disobey a higher up to get here”. He looked back at me with a sharp intensity. “Try not to disappoint”.
He was gone before I had a chance to speak. The birds continued by and the now three men were continuing on as if there had never been a fourth at all. The world was back in motion and I was filled with pride for knowing that I had finally been seen. But by who I wonder.

   The pressures on now. I’ve got eyes on me from Hell and who knows where else. Everyone in this God forsaken building is right where I want them though. I’m doubling down on the swamp water, keeping the pleasant aroma and adding one new ingredient. The pulverized, nearly liquified, meat of the souls trapped within Beelzebub’s lower jaw. They’re scooped up from the chasm he resides in and forever mashed and churned between the many rows of his molars. You’d think in this state there’d be nothing left of the body or soul but everything remains. Even while mush, spread out between the grooves of the teeth, the pain of being chewed feels to them like the very first crunch every single time. We’re four hours into the work day and it’s time for lunch. The room is packed tight. Everyone sitting scarfing down their food in between agitated breathes, most on their fifth or sixth drink of the day. The air is thick with a menacing tension.

Joe slams open the door entering the break room and marching over to Tom sitting shakily over his meal. “Tom! Hey shit head, you wana tell me why I’ve got all your scrap by my machine”? I noticed Joe was gripping a small screwdriver lightly coated in oil and metal dust. He bent down, now an inch from Tom’s face. “Answer me you fat slob! All you do is wreck everything and leave behind a mess and food crumbs everywhe-“! Joes verbal assault is suddenly cut short. Wide eyed with a confused and frightened look Joe chokes up blood and slowly grips the hefty plastic knife Tom has imbedded deep into his jugular. 

   Deafening silence lasts for mere seconds before Tom slams him to the table and begins pounding his fist into Joe’s temple repeatedly. Spurts of blood hit Samantha’s face who was sitting across from Tom. She licks the splattered blood off her lower lip and a cold dimness overtakes the eyes. She lunges across the table removing the knife from Joe’s throat and digging her fingers deep into the slit desperately removing and devouring whatever she can. All hell breaks loose as a bloody free for all erupts between the workers. Derick has Steven in an arm bar as he eats away at the wrist. Beth is sobbing uncontrollably beating her head against the concrete wall. The rest are caught in unrelenting fist fights and crazed self mutilation. I walked slowly between the symphony of carnage I had orchestrated. I nearly shed a tear witnessing the beauty of it all. Oh and I finally found Ray! He had locked himself in a storage closet eating away and the bloated corpses of the HR lady and supervisor he had dragged in days earlier. He clawed at the side of his face while crying quietly and nervously to himself between each bite. 

  As I was soaking it all in I quickly realized that Frankie was missing out on all the fun! I shut my eyes, focused and opened them back up to see that I was standing beside Frankie in his bed. Face bandaged up unable to sleep and recover. His mind racing with bills, self doubts as a father and provider. The list goes on and on. I can hear his wife and children in the next room. The sounds of crying and hushing rattling his eardrums. I knelt down beside him and whispered thoughts into his mind. “There is a way out. A way to quiet all the stress and be rid of it”. His eyes shifted downward slowly. “You know exactly what you have to do. It would only take seconds.. Merciful really.. you can finally bring peace to this family”. He sat up out of bed and made his way to the closet. He hesitated a moment before opening the door to reveal a loaded shotgun amidst coats and old moving boxes. 

   He had never really been interested in guns. It was a paranoid purchase thinking he’d need it for the protection of his family. I made the shrill cries of his children ring unbearably loud in his ears. Shaking violently he grabbed the shotgun and burst into the next room. His wife jumped in shock unable to process what just entered the room. “FRANKIE?!” she yelled. “Wha- what are you doing”? She grabbed both babies and held them tightly to her chest. “Honey.. please.. I- I know things haven’t been great lately, we’ve been through so much but please y- you have to calm down”! Her words went unheard. Muffled by the ear piercing ringing and cries I’ve locked in his head. Tears streamed down his face. “Im.. Im so sorry” he said. I gently helped him to raise the gun and wrapped my hands over his. Both our fingers planted on the trigger. She tried to speak but fear kept anything other than short panicked cries from escaping her mouth. My eyes grew large, I clinched my teeth hard with the largest smile I had ever worn. We planted the stock  of the shotgun firmly into our shoulders and as he screamed out we squeezed the trigger. 

   With a powerful kick and loud bang we put a hole straight into the ceiling. Silence. She stared at him unblinking, mouth open. Frankie dropped the shotgun and I felt a hard shove back from him. “What the fuck?!” I yelled. He dropped to his knees sobbing “I’m - I’m so sorry! I don’t know what’s wrong with me! What’s happening to me! I can’t think I can’t do anything I.. I”.
She scooted forward with the babies now on both of their laps and wrapped her arms around him crying. “It’s ok!.. It’s ok.. I know.. I love you.. WE love you. We’ll get through this together”. He looked down. His two perfect baby girls, his entire world right in his lap. He held his wife and children and a bright light slammed against my face with a force that felt as if it could have easily killed me right then and there. 

   I awoke back in the coffee machine dazed and weak. The break room was dark and empty. Faded blood stains everywhere throughout. “How… how long have I been out?.. What the hell hit me”? I tried to leave the machine but couldn’t. My body felt in shambles. From the look of the stains it’s been at least four, maybe six weeks I thought. Voices grew loud quickly. In walked the officer and detective from before along with a few others wearing some type of hazmat cleanup suits. 

  “Tell you what I’ll be happy to never step foot in this place again” said the detective. “Tell me about it. The demolition crew can’t get here soon enough”. My heart sank. “This is it.. I’ll be buried in this rubble and returned to Hell”. I was worried but my body ached too much for me to act out or draw them in. I slumped down defeated. 
“Alright everyone let’s clear out of here. The boys will be here soon to finish this place off”. One by one I watched as they left out the door single file. Their hurried paces reminded me of how quickly it all went by. I relaxed accepting my fate. Perhaps I’ll be welcomed home with praises and a new rank. I grinned and closed my eyes to the satisfying thought. And then I felt it… *A3*. ",1,1752376804.0,u_Zandalf_the_Blue,0,1.0,False

The Phobos and Deimos Cabin, which he affectionately refers to as the Fear Cabin, because the Dread Cabin sounds dumb, has a reputation to keep up, as does he. He’s a terrifying and impressive figure, despite certain recent bird-related events, and he needs to show that. 

The cabin is decked out, as much as Mohamed feels willing to do anyway. The common room is clean, the door is opened, and little plates of zaalouk and pita chips decorate the end tables and coffee table. He’s even asked Rudy to clear out the cats. Or at least, he’s asked him to keep an eye on them and *please* put them out for the extent of the meeting. Does he expect them to do so? No. If they’re bothersome, he’ll deal with it himself. He’s as in-tune with cats as she is, he just doesn’t make a thing out of it.

Anyways, he’s even put out little posters around Camp with drawings done by himself, as well as directions or advertisements for the open house. Translations offered in Arabic first, then English in small lettering, of course.

With that, everything should be in order. He need only wait for his cousins and siblings, all informed, to arrive. When they do, he will not have too much to say to them, beyond just informing them that the cabin will see some more traffic in the coming season. He likes having an open house, as is his culture, and Mohamed intends to host a few events here if he can. He wants easy targets, of course.

1lyinjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Potential_Cold_2783/comments/1lyinjy/celiac_journey_neuro_symptoms_and_myoclonus/,Celiac Journey Neuro Symptoms and Myoclonus,"Hello.
I am a 31/F diagnosed with Celiac just over 2 years ago by blood test and biopsy confirmed.

I had weird symptoms since I was 10 years old. Severe anxiety, eczema, asthma, joint pain. Inflammatory symptoms waxed and waned. In my 20s I continued to have severe panic attacks, sometimes right after eating. My heart rate would spike. I had stomach aches and I took ginger gravol all of the time. I completed a pretty rigorous undergraduate study program (dont know how). 

I noticed severe acid reflux around 26, where I was prescribed proton pump inhibitors from an ENT. I felt hungry ALL of the time *probably nutrient deficient. Eventually my acid reflux was so bad I couldn't swallow and went to emergency, nothing helped except for natural supplements like slippery elm and taking out dairy and wheat for a while (as per my naturopath). I also want to add that I felt like I had to pee 24/7 / has cystitis. Horrible irritable bowel and pressure on my bowel made me think I had a UTI- and I took 3 or 4 rounds of antibiotics.

The non responsive acid reflux got me a referral to GI finally at 28! At this time I also suffered with horrible enamel, dental infections, multiple root canals, and an abscess that required an oral max surgeon. I was on about 5 or 6 courses of antibiotics and my lymph nodes would get huge. It took over a year to resolve this.

When I saw GI he was only worried about EoE because I had asthma and issues swallowing. Anywho by the this time I was quite ill, and also had 2 rounds of Covid, hair falling out and brain fog, blood was often in the toilet after using the washroom. I was anxious all of the time and total wreck but somehow working 50 or 60 hours a week. 

Scope revealed Celiac Disease (he didnt stage it but apparently my intestinal tract had mostly no villi). A lot of the cells were flat. He said I probably had it for a long time. I was relieved but upset- I had NO idea what I was in for at the time of diagnosis.

Diagnosed April 2023, and by June 2023 I never felt worse. I was itchy and had a rash, felt completely depersonalized, horrible constipation, anxiety, and I started experiencing twitching in my neck. I saw 2 allergists who said I had no allergies - this was all quite concerning. 

July 2023
I started having ataxia, brain fog, felt dizzy and off balance. And everytime I ate almost ANYTHING my neck would twitch and I began to experience full blown facial spasming and twitching and myoclonus in my legs and arms. I went to the ER 3 times, they all thought I was having focal seizures. Mind you I was not being careful and was definitely eating cc of gluten which I was unaware of *shared fryer. Or shared kitchen.

I saw a neurologist within only a few weeks *shocking for Canada that I got in so quickly. He told me to take keppra and magnesium which both made it ALOT worse after only a dose. So I never took it again. I was also told not to drive until I had an MRI in case they were seizures (I was terrified).

August 2023 I had 5 MRI's C spine T spine 3 different brain views *infused and non.

They came up clear!! 
I was relieved but confused 
I did so much research about leaky gut, lyme, celiac disease, candida blah blah. I ended up at another naturopath which was little help my neurologist actually said to take high dose vit c (slow release) and vit d plus a few other things. Which I did for a bit including vit b12. I was also a vegetarian at this time for 2 years.

I went crazy with diet pretty much an elimination diet. I was eating green apples with peel off only, soy meat(I know surprising but I dont have major issues with it) coconut yogurt plain, sweet potato and cooked broccoli, occasionally eggs. I lost 30 lbs in 3 months. I saw another naturopath no real answers just an IGG food test which was kinda helpful kinda not.

I found out corn nuts dairy were HUGE reactions from trying them. Nuts in particular were worse than gluten with the neurological symptoms (no idea why). After a few months of hell..

I slowly tried adding some things back in and I did get some twitching for a minute with some foods but it would subside. My tolerance seemed to increase to certain foods. Its like my body had to be re programmed? I started to improve a lot within the first year, but always felt off. I slowly started to eat meat again. Mostly due to lack of options.

fast forward. The symptoms all improved by 1 year I was able to tolerate coffee even and eat a lot of different foods, and tolerated corn starch. After a lot of waiting my EEG came back normal / no seizure activity. My neurologist said I had central nervous system hyperexcitation which could be immune related but he said hes never seen a case that severe due to celiac. Only leg twitching.

I noticed I had residual brain fog symptoms EVEN 1.5 years later and I stopped oats and really limited my cc with restaurants. I still cant eat dairy (major lactose intolerance) maybe casein as well not sure. And I cannot eat nuts. I also can get twitching from severe heat or cold exposure, flashing lights, and gluten is horrible. I noticed more improvements.

2 years and I've been doing ALOT better
I've really tightened my diet up with cross contact limits and cut out chips and sugar because I had to get 2 more root canals...

This last week 
I had gluten in some sort of contamination recently and within 10 or 15 minutes my whole face was twitching horribly again for an hour, my stomach hurt, horrific brain fog, IBS, crying, rage, depressed, joint pain, asthma flare, reflux, burning skin again. Residual symptoms have lasted 6 or 7 days now, I am feeling better, I still see neurology and am getting a second opinion on this weird trigger myoclonus reaction from mostly gluten nuts flashing lights / overstimulation.

Its a very bizarre and isolating experience. but overall I have to say I am healing and now I'm getting major reactions to gluten if I get even a small amount (ive been removed from it for a while). So that part is difficult but my baseline is getting a TON better. Just really noticing I have to eat more healthy whole foods to really experience true health as there has been years of damage.

I wanted to share my story because I know how challenging this can be and isolating!

1lyijjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1lyijjm/do_you_have_consistent_perfect_conditions_for/,"Do you have consistent ""perfect conditions"" for productivity, or does it change day by day?","I am trying to figure out if my situation is normal or not.
 
Basically, every day it seems I require different conditions to be productive (working/studying).
I have been paying attention to contributing factors such as diet, physical exercise, mental state, light and temperature, caffeine, sitting vs standing, how long my sessions are, how much sleep I get, etc. I've been experimenting a lot to find what feels good, but it always changes. 

For example: one day I'll do a light workout, then put on a cozy sweater and drink a coffee, and I can sit and work for a few hours at a time in the morning with the pomodoro method. All good. 
The next day, that routine will not work for me at all; I wake up with no energy to work out, the warm sweater makes me fall asleep in my chair, the caffeine doesn't help at all, I can't make it to the next time chunk without needing a break, and then after struggling for the first half of the day I suddenly get a burst of energy in the late afternoon/evening. I stay up late to capitalize on it, but then it just throws everything off for the next day. 

I guess it's not entirely a bad thing to just be in tune with myself and adapt as needed, but it's kind of exhausting that I can't just do my routine on autopilot. Plus it's demoralizing that I can't seem to get the same amount of work done every week. I want to feel like a have a routine that I can rely on to meet my goals.

I'd love to know what other people's experiences are in creating their ""perfect conditions"". Have you got your needs down to a science? If so, how did you do it? If not, how do you cope? Is it a bad thing that I can't find consistency?

It feels like I waste so much time playing detective with my own mind/body, but at the same time I can't just force myself to study when the conditions aren't right. If you've read this far and you know what I mean, please let me know I'm not alone. Thanks. ",1,1752376207.0,GetStudying,0,1.0,False

They didn’t put a label on anything. At first, Mira liked it that way—fluid, open. It felt spontaneous, almost cinematic.

Braden would show up late, unannounced but never unwelcome, carrying takeout and a bottle of red wine. They’d eat on the floor, laugh between bites, and fall asleep tangled in limbs and lazy conversation, old movies flickering light across her walls.

He kissed her like they had forever.
And she let herself believe that maybe this was love—natural, unforced. A slow unfolding.

But love doesn’t disappear when the sun rises.
And that’s when the shadows started to creep in.

At first, it was little things.
Texts left unanswered during the day. Calls that rang once, then died into voicemail. The second call? Blocked.

She reasoned with herself—everyone gets busy. Phones die. Batteries run low. Maybe he was just distracted. Maybe she was just overthinking, like always.

But when she asked, his answers came too fast.

“Sorry, dead battery.”
“Back-to-back meetings.”
“Signal’s trash at my office.”

He’d chuckle, kiss the top of her head, and change the subject before the question fully landed. His smile was soft. Reassuring. But something about it made her stomach tighten instead of settle.

That inner voice—the one she’d trained herself to ignore—started whispering again. Not loud. Not clear.
Just a faint pulse of knowing.
A quiet itch beneath the skin.

Then came the moment she couldn’t forget.

It was an ordinary Tuesday. Late afternoon. Mira was running errands in sweats, no makeup, her hair scraped into a bun. She clutched a small basket of lemons and parsley, calculating dinner in her head, when she looked up and froze.

Braden.

He was just a few feet away in the produce aisle, alone, carefully inspecting apples like the earth wasn’t shifting under her feet.

Her heart lifted before her thoughts could catch up.
“Braden!” she called, smiling, her arm rising mid-wave.

He looked up. Their eyes met.

And then—
He turned.

Just turned and walked straight out the automatic doors.

No smile.
No nod.
No explanation.

Mira stood frozen, hand still mid-air, basket clutched like a shield.

The moment passed in silence, but her body felt it like an earthquake. Her stomach dropped. Not from heartbreak—
Not yet.
But from something colder.

Recognition.

Not of him.
Of the pattern.

She wanted to believe it had been a mistake. That he hadn’t seen her. That he was distracted or late for something.

But she saw it. The flicker in his eyes.
That moment of recognition—followed not by joy, but calculation. Panic.
A decision.

And he chose to disappear.

Maybe he was hiding her.
Or maybe… she was just a fool.

But something inside her shifted.
Something small. Something sharp.

A seed planted in silence.
A thorn of doubt that would only grow.
And like all things buried too deep, it didn’t stay quiet for long.

Days passed.

Mira buried herself in routine—folding laundry she didn’t care about, cooking meals she didn’t taste, working late just to avoid the stillness that came after. Her apartment stayed clean, the candles always burning, the TV murmuring into the silence like a lullaby for the lie she was living in.

Braden was distant again, but not gone. He always came back, always with that lopsided grin and a kiss that stole her breath. Always with just enough charm to reset the doubt.

So she told herself not to spiral. Not to dig too deep.

Until that night.

She was curled up on the couch, bowl of cold leftover pasta in her lap, wrapped in a soft blanket and the dull glow of candlelight. A crime show played halfheartedly on the screen, but she wasn’t watching. Her eyes were heavy. Her thoughts are heavier.

Then her phone buzzed on the coffee table.

Unknown Number.

She almost didn’t pick up.

But something in her gut twisted. A strange tightening in her chest. A signal. Like her body recognized the storm before her brain caught the scent of lightning.

Her thumb hovered.

Then she answered.

“Hello?”

The voice on the other end was calm. Too calm. Feminine. Precise. It didn’t match the chaos Mira felt instantly rise in her throat.

“Hi. Is this Mira?”

She sat upright, the pasta forgotten.

“Yes. Who is this?”

A pause, deliberate.

“My name is Rebecca,” the woman said. Her tone had no tremble—just the measured control of someone who had rehearsed this moment. “I’m Braden’s girlfriend.”

Mira’s world lurched sideways. The words hit like a slap, sharp and surreal.

“I’m sorry… what?”

“I just thought you should know,” Rebecca continued, unmoved. “You’re not the only one. You never were. He’s been with me for over a year.”

Everything went quiet.

No sound. No breath. Just the dull roar of blood in Mira’s ears and the weight of something snapping loose in her chest.

“I found your texts,” Rebecca went on, her voice still maddeningly calm. “The way he talks to you… I figured you deserved the truth.”

Then the line went dead.

Call ended.

No further explanation. No rage. Just a quiet detonation.

Mira stared at the screen.

Rebecca.

A name she’d never heard. A truth she couldn’t argue with. A bomb that didn’t leave smoke—just silence.

Her hands trembled as she set the phone down. She couldn’t feel her limbs. Her skin felt wrong. Too tight. Her body was in the room, but her mind was a thousand miles away, floating somewhere cold and dark.

She didn’t cry.

She couldn’t.

She just sat there—still as stone, her pulse pounding like a siren in her throat.

I keep hoping that the complete lack of awareness or care for anyone but herself will go away with time, but I’m starting to doubt it will ever happen. I know teenagers are narcissistic as a developmental thing, I just wonder at what point it transitions into being abnormal and we begin to expect accountability for the selfish behaviors.

I bought us (me, husband, SD) food and coffees this morning on our way to do activities I thought SD would enjoy. I ordered ahead and we went in to grab the food and drinks off the counter. Instead of helping us, SD stood on the other side of the place, messing with a necklace she had brought inside, I think trying to put a pendant on it or something. Nothing that was urgent or couldn’t have been done in the car.

SD asked me if I knew of a good nail place around here for acrylic nails. I’ve never worn acrylics before in my life, but even if I was aware of a place, I wouldn’t tell her. Wtf. This isn’t something her dad would do with her and something she can do when she’s back home. She’s only here for 3.5 days.

She doesn’t seem to really care about anything we’ve brought her to—things she said she wanted to do while she was here. We bought tickets for the Japanese garden and she was ready to leave after about 30 minutes without even seeing all of it. She spent more time in the gift shop on the way out. It all just feels like a waste of time, money, and energy. 

Is this normal behavior for an 18 year old? I know they are small things, but it’s stacked on top of years of this same type of behavior along with much bigger things that have transpired in the recent past.

Chapter 1 Let's Divorce

The night before their third wedding anniversary, Cary Gibson emerged victorious from a high-end auction, securing a pair of rare sapphire earrings.

He said softly, ""This is for the person I owe the most-my beloved.""

From home, his wife, Evelina Marsh, felt tears pooling as she watched the auction on television. Tomorrow was their third anniversary, and maybe, at long last, Cary had realized her devotion.

Cary's grandmother, Demi Gibson, exhaled in quiet satisfaction. ""At long last, Cary's learned how valuable his wife truly is.""

The next evening, Evelina had barely set the finishing touches on an extravagant dinner when Cary stepped through the door.

She hurried to greet him, swiftly taking his briefcase before reaching out for his coat.


""Quite a feast tonight,"" he said lightly. ""Did something happen?""

Tall and captivating, Cary carried himself effortlessly. Even the simple act of loosening his tie appeared like a polished gesture from a high-fashion shoot.

Yet, somehow, he always managed to chill Evelina with just a few words. Her fingers paused uncertainly, and she quietly said, ""You didn't forget, did you?""

No, that couldn't be right. He had purchased those priceless sapphire earrings to make amends, hadn't he?

Cary's eyebrows knitted together slightly. ""Forget what exactly, Evelina?""

""The sapphire earrings... you bought them, didn't you?"" Her heart trembled with unease, but hope stubbornly remained.

""How do you know about those earrings?"" Cary appeared genuinely startled. He clearly didn't expect his mild-mannered, invisible wife to keep

tabs on such extravagant things.

A faint smirk tugged at his lips, hinting at contempt.

Certainly, Evelina possessed natural beauty-gentle features, eyes soft and expressive-but she refused to flaunt it. She dressed plainly, appearing perpetually dull and overlooked, like a flower that had ceased to bloom.

Even the Gibson household maid seemed more refined than Evelina.

Yet, Evelina gathered her courage, eyes shining cautiously. ""I saw the auction broadcast. Those earrings are really lovely-""

Cary interjected her abruptly, ""They're for Esme.""

At the mere mention of his first love, Esme Barton, Cary's voice softened noticeably. ""She's finally agreed to return to me. Naturally, I needed something special to welcome her back.""

Evelina felt her chest tighten painfully, her breath hitching.

So, the one he felt indebted to was Esme Barton,

the very woman who had abandoned him?

And what did that make her-the devoted wife who had stood beside him for three years without complaint, never even asking for recognition?

Unable to bear it, Evelina's voice wavered with hurt. ""Cary, have you forgotten whose fault the accident was-the one that blinded you?""

On that terrible day, Esme had thrown a tantrum over something insignificant, distracting Cary and causing him to crash.

When news broke that Cary's sight was likely permanently lost, Esme swiftly disappeared, crafting a flimsy excuse before fleeing overseas the same day. She left no trace, vanishing completely.

Their wedding had already been announced, invitations sent. Neither Esme nor her family could be located.

If Evelina hadn't courageously stepped in at the final hour, the Gibson family would've been the scandalous gossip of the whole city.
""You know nothing about it!"" Cary retorted harshly. ""Esme wasn't to blame!""

He refused to tolerate any criticism directed at his so-called true love. ""Esme arranged the surgeries for my eyes,"" he replied defensively. ""If someone hadn't accidentally revealed the truth, I would never have known everything she secretly did for me.""

Stunned, Evelina could barely form words. ""What... are you saying?""

It was Evelina herself who performed his surgeries. His grandmother had practically begged her for help. She had conducted three critical procedures, pushing herself to exhaustion. Countless sleepless nights she spent tending to him, never revealing she was the renowned Sight Weaver, devoting herself entirely to Cary.

How had Esme ended up with all the credit?

""Are you certain? You trust every rumor you hear?""

""Absolutely. Esme was Professor Landen Mitchell's last apprentice-the only person on Earth qualified to perform those surgeries,"" Cary responded with
unwavering pride and gratitude.

But wasn't Evelina actually Professor Mitchell's final apprentice? How long had Esme been pretending to be her?

Evelina desperately wanted to expose Esme's deception right then and there, but she quickly recalled her mentor's death six months earlier.

Of course, Esme would choose now to make her return.

With Landen gone, no one could challenge Esme's claims. And Cary, fully healed through Evelina's care, now held significant influence as head of the Gibson Group. Esme's timing was impeccably strategic.

Evelina had no evidence, no way to reveal the truth.

Quietly, bitterly, she asked, ""Then what are you even doing here tonight? Shouldn't you be celebrating with Esme?""

Removing her apron abruptly, Evelina felt despair gnawing painfully at her heart

Cary's answer was casual and indifferent. ""I'm exhausted, Evelina. Let's end this marriage. We agreed on three years, and I've endured it long enough.""

Endured it long enough? How dare he casually dismiss all her sacrifices?

Three long years she'd sacrificed, pouring everything she had into nursing him back from blindness, making him the powerful man he had become.

Without even acknowledging the anguish on her face, Cary calmly took out a set of divorce documents, obviously prepared ahead of time. ""Review them. If you have no objections, sign. I've wasted enough time already. I won't make Esme wait anymore.""

Glancing over the papers, Evelina focused bitterly on the divorce settlement an apartment far from the city center, the worn-out car she'd driven for groceries, and a mere three million dollars.

Incredible. His audacity was astonishing.


He'd gifted sapphire earrings worth three hundred million to the woman responsible for his blindness, yet offered a paltry three million to the wife who had saved him.

Three million wouldn't even cover the cost of one of her surgeries, let alone make up for the countless procedures she had rejected during these three years spent hidden away, caring only for him.

""If you want more..."" Cary anticipated tears or pleading from Evelina.

Instead, she scoffed softly, picked up the pen decisively, and signed her name with determination.

Cary faltered, bewildered. He hadn't expected her to surrender so quickly. Evelina was an orphan-would she really walk away from a life of comfort?

Handing back the signed papers, Evelina said coldly and clearly, ""It's done. But Cary, you'd better not regret your choice.”

Chapter 2 The Queen Returns

Momentarily startled, Cary recovered quickly. ""Of course I won't regret this. But since you accepted the settlement, it's your responsibility to explain the divorce to Grandma.""

Cary knew perfectly well that Demi only recognized Evelina as her true granddaughter-in-law. If news of their divorce reached her ears, he'd face her wrath.

And naturally, Cary expected Evelina to shoulder the blame.

Without raising her gaze, Evelina calmly replied, ""I'm not explaining anything to her. In these past three years, I've settled my debt with Demi in full. Aren't you madly in love with Esme? What's wrong-can't even muster enough courage to face your own grandmother?""

Growing up in an orphanage, Evelina owed her education entirely to Demi's generosity.

So when the Gibson family urgently needed a

substitute bride, she'd readily stepped in.

She didn't flinch when Cary lost his vision. Instead, she fulfilled her duties faithfully, cared tirelessly for him, and managed the household without complaint.

She had one modest request-a three-year trial. If Cary failed to fall in love with her by the end, they'd peacefully part ways.

Now, finally, her freedom had arrived.

""True love conquers everything,"" Evelina replied dryly, sarcasm lightly coating her words. ""I genuinely hope your perfect fairytale lasts forever.""

Reaching for her car keys, she found her path abruptly blocked by Margot Gibson, Cary's younger sister.

""Evelina, I heard you're divorcing my brother. That car is Gibson family property-you can't take it!""

Evelina laughed coldly. ""I paid for this car myself. Honestly, Margot, you're just as brazen as Cary.""

Drawn by the commotion, Cary stepped forward.

""What's happening here?""

Immediately, Margot complained petulantly, saying, ""Cary, Evelina is taking the car, and I was planning to use it!""

His brow creased slightly. ""Evelina, hand over the keys to Margot.""

""Absolutely not,"" she replied coldly. ""Why should I?""

""You're unbelievable!"" Margot lunged forward to grab the keys.

Suddenly, an old suitcase flew into the vehicle, followed swiftly by several lit firecrackers.

In moments, sparks flew and thick smoke billowed as the firecrackers erupted, sending Margot shrieking in panic.

""The car is yours-I don't want it,"" Evelina responded coolly, brushing off her hands as she turned decisively away.

Everything she'd used or worn in the Gibson household would remain. She wanted nothing to remind her of this place.
She quickly dialed her closest friend, Kristina Anderson.

As Evelina reached the villa gates, a sleek, understated luxury car awaited her.

Kristina's jaw dropped dramatically. ""Well, if it isn't the real Queen Evelina herself!""

Feigning astonishment, Kristina rubbed her eyes. ""Three years, Evelina. Every call I've made, you were too preoccupied tending to that ungrateful husband. I honestly couldn't tell whether I'd attended your wedding or your funeral back then.""

Leaping forward, Kristina embraced Evelina tightly. ""Finally done with that 'blind' fool? Good. Now we start living for real.""

Kristina snapped her fingers theatrically. ""Wait, no -I need to stock up on fireworks! Your grand return demands a proper celebration.""

""You're too late,"" Evelina said coolly, gesturing casually over her shoulder.

Just. then, an explosive bang split the peaceful

night. The old car erupted spectacularly into flames.

Sparks scattered brilliantly, lighting up the darkness in a vivid display.

""How's that for a farewell gift?"" Evelina asked with a playful grin, her eyebrow arched mischievously.

Kristina erupted into laughter. ""There she is! Queen Evelina is finally back! Time to party!""

Sliding into the passenger seat, Evelina gave an exhausted sigh. ""Another day, perhaps. I just desperately need sleep.""

She had spent the last three years caring tirelessly for Cary's recovery, barely managing to rest properly. Fatigue weighed heavily on her now.

Inside the villa, Margot was stamping her foot furiously.

""She nearly scared me to death! Has Evelina lost her mind? She destroyed our car! Cary, you have to do something about her-""

""That's enough!"" Cary interrupted sharply.

Exasperation lined his voice as he scolded, ""Is this childish tantrum how a Gibson should behave?""

Margot quickly shifted to a pleading, wounded tone, saying, ""Are you actually scolding me over that woman? Wait until I tell Esme-she'll see how much you've changed!""

""Don't talk nonsense,"" Cary retorted irritably, though privately dismissing Evelina as compared to his sister. insignificant

He quickly softened his voice to reassure her. ""Have you forgotten Jasper Russell is arriving in Aglonard soon?""

The Russell family, among Ireah's most influential families, dominated politics, business, and military circles, making them untouchably powerful.

And Jasper Russell, their youngest heir, wasn't only extraordinarily charismatic but also managed the immense Russell Group. His slightest gesture sent ripples across high society.

Most importantly, he was the only bachelor among the Russell heirs. Every wealthy young woman in

Aglonard and beyond fantasized about becoming Mrs. Russell.

""I haven't forgotten,"" Margot murmured shyly, blushing deeply at the mention of her admired figure.

She clung affectionately to Cary's arm, adding eagerly, ""He's visiting for his niece's eye treatment. If Esme successfully heals Miss Florrie Russell's eyesight, she'll become indispensable to the Russell family-and undeniably valuable to us. Even Grandma will have to accept her then.""

Cary gave a thoughtful nod.

Esme's supposed medical talent had drawn the Russells to Aglonard, presenting them with a perfect opportunity to solidify powerful alliances.

""And if you assist Esme during the operation and gain Miss Russell's favor... perhaps Jasper himself will notice you,"" he suggested encouragingly.

""Oh, thank you, Cary!"" Margot's eyes sparkled as dreams filled her head.

But Cary's thoughts wandered unexpectedly. The image of Evelina striding confidently away, fearless and poised, lingered stubbornly.

He had dismissed her as plain, passive, even boring.

This daring, fierce version of her was entirely unexpected.

Perhaps... he needed to reassess the woman he'd overlooked for three years.

Chapter 3 The Wife Versus The Homewrecker

Evelina spent three uninterrupted days catching up on sleep in Kristina's luxurious presidential suite.

Aside from brief intervals of nibbling on snacks, she barely moved, with Kristina even applying rejuvenating face masks for her.

On the fourth morning, Demi called unexpectedly, requesting Evelina's presence at the Gibson Mansion.

It wasn't difficult to guess the reason behind the call-no doubt it concerned the divorce.

Kristina, however, suspected something deeper.

She said, ""I doubt it's that simple. Apparently, Florrie Russell, the eldest granddaughter of the influential Russell family, recently went blind after suffering a severe head injury. The family has exhausted their options with renowned specialists

and is now desperately seeking Landen Mitchell's elusive protege-the Sight Weaver.

Jasper Russell himself is arriving in Aglonard to oversee the search personally. Demi is the only one aware of your true identity, and I'm concerned she might try to-""

Evelina quickly reassured her. ""Demi vowed never to expose my identity. Don't worry.""

Kristina remained cautious. ""Just make sure the Gibson family don't take advantage of your skills again.""

""I'll be careful,"" Evelina replied firmly.

Still unconvinced, Kristina said decisively, ""You won't be meeting them looking like this.""

Immediately after breakfast, Kristina summoned her private beauty team. ""Your mission: revive our sleeping beauty.""

And they did. After ample rest, Evelina resembled a wilting flower that had finally received sunlight. Her skin was luminous, her features radiant, and the
tiredness that had dimmed her gaze for years completely disappeared, replaced by clarity and allure.

With a refined cocktail dress and minimal yet tasteful makeup, Evelina transformed dramatically.

Kristina stood speechless for several moments before exclaiming, ""Cary must've been utterly blind to trade a goddess for someone like Esme.""

Precisely on time, the Gibson family's chauffeur-driven vehicle arrived outside the hotel.

Asher, the family's longtime butler, personally came to escort her. Initially, he didn't recognize Evelina at all.

He stared uncertainly until she greeted him, causing recognition to dawn suddenly. ""Ms. Marsh?"" He stumbled over his words. ""You look absolutely extraordinary.""

Within half an hour, the car pulled up at the Gibson Mansion, with Asher quickly stepping out to courteously open her door.

Yet when his gaze landed upon Evelina, he stopped abruptly, utterly captivated.

Just a few days had passed-how had she transformed so stunningly? Evelina radiated an effortless, compelling beauty.

Noticing Cary's astonishment, Esme's jaw tightened, though she maintained her gentle smile. ""That's your ex-wife, isn't it?"" she said softly. ""Since we've run into her, you might as well say hello. It must have been challenging for an orphan like her to follow you all this way.""

Esme spoke softly, but each word stung sharper than a slap-acting as if she, not Evelina, was the genuine Mrs. Gibson.

Startled out of her reverie, Margot immediately exploded in anger. ""Evelina! Where did you get the money to dress up like this? Did you drain Cary's accounts for your new face and that designer dress?""

Even Esme had opted for simplicity today, avoiding unnecessary attention. Seeing Evelina effortlessly steal the spotlight was unbearable for Margot.


She hesitated briefly before hissing spitefully, ""Look at you, dressed like a tramp. Trying to win Cary back? You're delusional!""

In a rage, Margot lunged forward, claws reaching viciously for Evelina's dress and hair.

Quickly stepping in, Asher intervened firmly, ""Miss Gibson, please! There are esteemed guests today -this isn't appropriate behavior for a Gibson.""

Ignoring Asher's plea, Margot shouted furiously, ""I'll rip that smug face of yours apart!""

Remaining composed, Evelina calmly raised her phone, recording Margot's tantrum. With cold confidence, she replied, ""Keep going. Let's show Jasper Russell exactly how refined you really are.""

Margot froze instantly, eyes wide. Her threats died in her throat, replaced by a scorching glare. ""You wouldn't dare!""

Switching tactics, Margot theatrically leaned against Esme, feigning vulnerability. ""Esme, please protect me. We'll be family soon-you have to defend me.”

3

She emphasized ""family"" deliberately, aiming to needle Evelina.

Tenderly, Esme stroked Margot's hair as if comforting a child. ""It's alright. Nobody will harm you as long as I'm here.""

Evelina scoffed sharply, ""Where are Demi and Elora Gibson? Since when do outsiders dictate rules in this house?""

Esme's expression turned rigid.

This wasn't the gentle Evelina they all expected. How had she developed such an unexpectedly sharp tongue?

Margot quickly retorted, ""Who's the outsider? You're the one who doesn't belong here!"" Turning to Cary, she said, ""Did you hear what she said to Esme? You can't let her bully us like that!""

With practiced grace, Esme sighed softly. ""It's okay. Evelina didn't have parents to teach her manners-it's not her fault. Cary, please don't blame her.""

Evelina rolled her eyes, clearly irritated by Esme's
implication.

Yet Cary saw none of Evelina's frustration. In his eyes, Esme's gentle tolerance only amplified her perfection.

Stepping protectively toward Esme, Cary embraced her tenderly before turning coldly to Evelina. His voice was cutting, saying, ""If you think causing trouble will win you points, you're mistaken. It's pathetic. Apologize to Esme right now.”

Chapter 4 Demi T

Without even sparing Cary a glance, Evelina replied curtly, ""Maybe fix your own judgment before trying to lecture me.""

Determined to avoid further nonsense, she brushed past them swiftly, eager not to keep Demi waiting.

""Don't you dare walk away from me!"" Cary's temper flared, readying himself to berate her once more-but his words vanished as his gaze caught her retreating figure.

Her tailored dress embraced her flawless curves perfectly, her hair cascaded effortlessly down her elegant back, accentuating her slender shoulders and defined waist-details he'd somehow overlooked until now.

Every confident step she took radiated strength, poise, and elegance.

Even the mere outline of her form seemed captivating enough to linger in his thoughts indefinitely.

It struck him painfully: this extraordinary woman was about to become his ex-wife, yet he hadn't even touched her once.

Noticing Cary's intense stare, Esme felt a wave of irritation surge through her, and she sharply pushed herself out of his arms, storming away.

Margot immediately panicked, tugging frantically at Cary's sleeve. ""What are you doing, Cary? You've upset Esme, and now she's leaving!""

Cary blinked, momentarily disoriented, and by the time he regained his senses, Margot was already chasing after Esme.

Inside the mansion, Demi sat in solitude, leaning tiredly against her ornate pearwood chair, glancing anxiously toward the entrance every few moments.

Spotting Evelina, she brightened instantly, rising to welcome her affectionately. ""Evi, my dear girl, you've endured so much.""

""Please don't worry yourself, Demi."" Quickly approaching, Evelina gently helped her sit again, kneeling beside her to carefully massage her aching knees. ""The weather is getting chilly-are your joints troubling you again?""

Demi sighed deeply. ""Same old pain, dear. No one eases it like you do; your treatments are irreplaceable.""

""You've treated me like family all these years, Demi. This is the very least I can do in return,"" Evelina replied sincerely.

Her honest kindness only deepened Demi's regret.

""That foolish grandson of mine-blindly letting go of such a gem! He deserves a beating,"" Demi replied softly.

Evelina gave a gentle shake of her head. ""It's alright, Demi.""

Tenderly, Demi pleaded, ""Evi, sweetheart... just once more, can you give Cary another chance-for my sake?”

""I've waited three long years for him to see me. He never did. Another chance wouldn't change anything,"" Evelina answered quietly.

She had offered countless opportunities, but Cary had repeatedly wasted them. It was finally time to let go.

Demi sighed heavily, sorrow evident in her tone. ""Perhaps it's just fate... our family wasn't fortunate enough to hold onto someone like you.""

Her eyes glistened with tears.

Just then, Margot and Esme entered noisily, chattering cheerfully alongside Cary's mother, Elora Gibson.

Demi's temper erupted immediately.

She snatched up a nearby coffee cup and threw it furiously toward Esme's feet.

Fragments of porcelain scattered violently, coffee splattering across Esme's luxurious heels and the delicate fabric of her custom-made gown.


A sharp cry escaped Esme's lips as she stared, utterly horrified. Though appearing deceptively understated, every stitch of her attire was meticulously selected from exclusive boutiques-her dress alone carried a hefty price, deliberately crafted to exude graceful elegance.

Predictably, the Gibson mother-and-daughter pair, notorious for their lack of fashion sense, were oblivious to its true value.

""What was that about, Grandma?"" Cary exclaimed, swiftly stepping forward to shelter Esme once more, flashing a bitter glance toward Demi.

Demi, however, remained fiercely unapologetic. ""How dare you even ask? Without this woman's antics, would you have had your accident? Would you have lost your sight?""

More painful to Demi than Esme abandoning their engagement was the reality that Esme had almost irreversibly ruined Cary's bright future.

Demi had always seen Cary as her greatest pride-Esme hadn't just harmed her grandson, she'd damaged the entire Gibson legacy.

""I've said this countless times,"" Cary responded in exasperation. ""Esme wasn't responsible for that accident. Why can't you trust me?""

His accusing stare shifted pointedly toward Evelina, who was quietly comforting Demi, gently rubbing her back to ease her breathing.

It had to be Evelina causing trouble again-poisoning Demi's mind.

Without restraint, he said sharply, ""Evelina, have you been whispering lies to Grandma, stirring things up behind our backs?"" (1

Seizing the opportunity, Elora, who had always despised Evelina's modest upbringing, immediately spat venomously, saying, ""Of course it's her! That orphan would do anything to cling onto this family. She may act sweet, but beneath the surface, she's utterly despicable!""

Before Evelina had the chance to defend herself, Demi interrupted harshly, ""Enough! Evelina is the granddaughter-in-law I chose personally. Do you
dare disrespect her right before my eyes? Are you openly challenging my authority?""

Elora blanched visibly, quickly stammering, ""Demi, I didn't mean-""

Seeing his mother close to tears, Cary intervened protectively, ""Grandma, please stop scolding Mom. Let's just face reality-you simply don't want me to leave Evelina.""

Turning deliberately, he took Esme's hand firmly into his own, fingers intertwined intimately. ""But that's non-negotiable. Esme is the one I love-she is my only future.""

""Excellent. Marvelous. Absolutely perfect,"" Demi responded bitterly, each word dripping with harsh sarcasm. Anger visibly surged through her, shaking her frail body.

Reacting swiftly, Evelina retrieved a vial of heart medication, administering it carefully to Demi.

After a brief pause to regain composure, Demi said with cold certainty, ""Then let me be clear. Divorce Evelina, and you must immediately surrender ten
percent of your Gibson shares directly to her. And Esme? She will never set foot inside the Gibson household again while I'm alive.""

Cary's eyes widened in alarm. ""Grandma, you can't mean-""

With fierce authority, Demi's frail hand slammed against her chair's armrest, the sharp noise resonating clearly. ""I've spoken, and my decision is final,"" she replied resolutely. ""Defy me, Cary, and you forfeit your place as a Gibson.”


Chapter 5 Imposter

""Grandma, are you serious? Shares for her?"" Margot immediately protested, indignation coloring her voice. ""She's nobody-just some orphan without parents-""

Margot's rant was swiftly silenced by Demi's piercing glare, causing her to retreat sheepishly, shrinking like a scolded child.

Quiet sobs emerged from Elora. ""Demi, Cary is your own grandson...""

With a dismissive snort, Demi retorted sharply, ""I have more than one grandson. If he insists on chasing love blindly, let's see how deep his pockets run.""

She intended to expose the harsh reality to Cary-if Esme had abandoned him during his blindness, she'd undoubtedly vanish once he was penniless. Esme was trouble incarnate, certainly not the kind of woman who'd stick by him through hardships.

Muscles tense, Cary's jaw tightened noticeably, his temple pulsing with barely contained anger. Directing his resentment at Evelina, he said bitterly, ""Satisfied now?""

Though Evelina was deeply moved by Demi's fierce support, she remained composed, gently supporting the elderly woman to help stabilize her breathing.

Demi battled chronic blood pressure issues, a weak heart, and aching joints sensitive to seasonal changes.

Had Evelina not worried these ungrateful relatives might push Demi toward a heart attack, she would've already walked away.

""Ma'am-Ma'am!""

Abruptly, a flustered servant hurried into the room, gasping for breath. ""Mr. Russell... he's arrived!""

""Bring him in."" Demi straightened quickly, regaining her composure to receive their distinguished guest.

""Bring him in."" Demi straightened quickly, regaining her composure to receive their distinguished guest.

Margot scrambled anxiously, nearly stumbling over


herself. ""Mom! Am I perfect? Is my hair okay? Makeup flawless?""

With maternal pride, Elora reassured her daughter warmly. ""You're stunning, sweetheart. Absolutely flawless-"" Her thoughts darkened instantly, wishing fervently Evelina wasn't present.

Sharply pivoting toward Evelina, Elora said, ""We're expecting an important guest. Shouldn't you discreetly leave through the back entrance?""

Still holding Demi gently, Evelina smiled serenely, unfazed. ""Thanks for reminding me. Actually, Cary and I haven't officially divorced yet. Legally speaking, I'm still his wife-a rightful member of this family.""

She cast an indifferent glance toward Esme, still melodramatically crying into Cary's chest. ""But Miss Barton here... she's merely the mistress. Hardly appropriate company to welcome a respected visitor.""

""How dare you!"" Esme gasped, tears streaming theatrically down her cheeks.

Cary immediately stepped forward protectively, his expression stormy. ""Mind your tongue, Evelina! Mr. Russell came specifically for Esme. She's exceptional-the only one skilled enough to restore his niece's eyesight.""

His words halted Demi's departure. Slowly, she turned back, astonishment evident. ""Who did you say could cure blindness?""

""Esme,"" Cary said proudly, his chest puffing with pride. ""Renowned as the Sight Weaver herself. She was personally trained by Professor Landen Mitchell-she even cured me.""

At that moment, Demi finally got it-why Evelina had decided to give up on her grandson.

Honestly, she wouldn't blame her one bit.

""Esme, is this true?"" Demi's tone sharpened dangerously, her eyes narrowing.

Unable to meet Demi's piercing gaze, Esme remained nervously silent.

Yet Cary, unaware, kept lauding Esme's supposed
talents, with Elora and Margot eagerly chiming in, elevating her to almost mythical status.

A low, commanding voice smoothly interrupted their exaggerated praise. ""Seems I've arrived at the perfect moment.""

Standing confidently at the end of the hallway was a tall man, his broad shoulders and authoritative aura instantly capturing everyone's attention.

Elora instantly beamed with anticipation. ""Мг. Russell, you're finally here-we've been waiting eagerly!""

Though she'd never personally met Jasper Russell, a single glance at his immaculate attire, particularly the sophisticated handcrafted shoes, confirmed his identity.

Overwhelmed with excitement, Elora practically dragged Margot along as they rushed to welcome him.

Margot, blushing fiercely and visibly nervous, nearly stumbled in her eagerness.

Just as she opened her mouth to greet him, the man strode right past her without acknowledgment, stopping purposefully in front of Esme. ""You're the renowned Sight Weaver?""

Esme felt her pulse quicken painfully.

She was all too aware of the consequences of deceiving someone of Jasper Russell's caliber-there was absolutely no room for error.

""I... I apologize,"" Esme stuttered hastily, desperation evident. ""My dress got stained. I need to change immediately.""

She quickly spun around, eyeing the nearest doorway for escape.

However, Evelina's composed voice stopped her cold. ""Miss Barton, surely you're not running away already? Could it be because you're pretending to be Professor Mitchell's student?""

Evelina's calm accusation sliced through the tension like a sharp knife.

If Esme was set on snatching up a cheating jerk like

Cary, she could have him-no one was stopping her.

Yet, shamelessly exploiting her mentor's reputation to climb the social ladder crossed an unforgivable boundary.

""That's nonsense!"" Esme retorted furiously, glaring daggers at Evelina.

Aware all eyes were on her, Esme continued her charade desperately. ""I studied under Professor Mitchell in graduate school, while you were busy playing housewife and folding clothes.""

""Oh?"" Evelina's soft smile was deceptively gentle. ""If that's true, then surely you know how many surgeries Cary underwent to regain his vision?""

She had personally conducted three major surgeries, alongside one subtle corrective procedure she'd never publicly mentioned.

After a hesitant pause, Esme confidently replied, ""Three, obviously. I performed each myself.""

""You're lying."" Demi's voice sliced sharply through the air. ""It was four.”
Esme visibly paled before hastily correcting herself, saying, ""R-right, four! Of course it was four.""

""Make up your mind, Esme-was it three surgeries or four?"" Demi asked coldly, her voice dripping with disdain.


Chapter 6 The Bet

Esme visibly recoiled under Demi's demanding glare, her palms suddenly slick with nervous perspiration.

Desperately, she stammered an excuse. ""There have been countless surgeries... I honestly can't recall each one clearly-""

""A surgeon who forgets the procedures she has performed?"" Evelina smoothly interrupted, her voice tinged with mockery. ""It seems you're nothing but an imposter. Care to prove me wrong with a little wager?""

Margot burst out indignantly. ""Who are you to challenge Esme like that?"" But she instantly fell silent when Elora silenced her sharply, reminding her of decency.

Completely unfazed, Evelina's eyes sparkled with quiet defiance as she addressed Esme again, saying, ""Miss Barton, if your claims are legitimate, surely this won't faze you?”

""Fine! I accept your ridiculous bet."" Esme tightened her grip around Cary's arm, convinced she saw right through Evelina's game. ""You're clearly desperate to win Cary back, aren't you?""

""Pathetic,"" Elora sneered disdainfully.

For Elora, wealth equaled respectability. Those lacking it deserved neither acknowledgment nor courtesy.

Refusing to be provoked, Evelina coolly fixed her gaze on Esme, her tone deceptively gentle. ""Here's the bet-prove you can restore Florrie Russell's sight.""

""Enough of your slander!"" Cary growled angrily. ""Esme reviewed Florrie's medical records herself and assured me she can treat it!""

Earlier, Cary had handed Esme the detailed medical reports sent by the Russell family. She had confidently declared Florrie's condition manageable.

Privately, Esme cursed Cary's gullibility. She'd made those promises purely to sound impressive, not expecting they'd be seriously tested.
""Wonderful,"" Evelina responded calmly. ""Then let's be clear-if you fail, you'll apologize publicly at Professor Mitchell's grave and confess your deception to the global media.""

She looked forward to seeing Esme squirm her way out of that scenario.

""You're shameless,"" Cary scoffed dismissively. ""You'll do anything to tarnish Esme's reputation. What if she succeeds-what then?""

Without skipping a beat, Evelina responded confidently, ""Then I'll openly admit my error for everyone to see.""

""Not good enough!"" Margot interjected fiercely. ""If Esme wins, you'll vanish from my brother's life forever!""

""Agreed,"" Evelina affirmed without hesitation. Her eyes scanned the room thoughtfully before settling deliberately on one individual. ""Would you witness our bet?""

Looking up to meet her unwavering, clear gaze, the distinguished man hesitated briefly, then agreed
simply, ""Certainly.""

Flashing an effortless, radiant smile, Evelina replied confidently, ""Good. With a credible witness present, no one can wriggle out of this later.""

Instantly defensive, Esme retorted bitterly, ""Who exactly are you accusing, Evelina?""

""Enough!"" Demi's voice thundered decisively, silencing the room immediately. ""Esme, remember your place.""

This impostor dared present herself as the legendary Sight Weaver in front of the prestigious Russell family? She risked dragging the entire Gibson lineage through disgrace.

Gratefulness washed over Demi as she realized Evelina's presence was their only saving grace.

Evelina leaned close to Demi, whispering reassuringly, ""Leave Miss Russell's treatment to me but it will be the final favor I ever grant the Gibson family.""

With quiet resolve, Evelina turned gracefully and
exited without another glance.

She was done wasting her time in this toxic environment.

Elora rejoiced at her departure. Worried the Russells might confuse Evelina for family, she loudly called after her, ""Cary will handle the divorce papers first thing tomorrow. Don't you dare delay!""

Intently, the handsome man observed Evelina's departure, his thoughtful eyes narrowed with intrigue.

Unaware, Elora pivoted to him with exaggerated politeness. ""Mr. Russell, please stay for lunch-my daughter has prepared a special performance in your honor.""

He barely acknowledged her offer, dismissing it curtly. ""No, I have other matters to attend to.""

Fixing Esme with a steely, unreadable gaze, he continued evenly, ""Miss Barton, since you've confidently claimed you can treat my niece, I expect you to be fully prepared. The first operation is scheduled in one week's time.”
Only one week?

Panic surged through Esme immediately. ""I-1 might need more preparation time-""

""That's your concern, not mine,"" he replied coldly.

""You'll have top-tier equipment and a skilled medical team at your disposal. Just ensure your success. State your fee.""

He wasn't expecting miracles instantly-but if she couldn't even begin the procedure, her deception would be blatantly clear.

As he turned away, Margot hurried forward, eager to accompany him.

Within a few steps, the bodyguards swiftly redirected her, sending her back in embarrassment. Angrily, she stomped her foot, sobbing dramatically as she rushed to Cary and Elora for comfort.

Demi leveled a stern glare in Margot's direction.

""The Russells are beyond your reach-accept it. And you-"" She turned sharply on Elora. ""Teach your daughter some dignity.”


Chapter 81 A Thought Of Marrying Her

Cary collapsed into his seat, visibly defeated and silenced, his face a mask of humiliation.

Yet internally, he boiled with fury. Evelina had betrayed him, and he was determined not to let her escape consequence.

For Evelina, Cary's feelings were a distant concern. Even as Jasper declared her his, she only briefly registered surprise before focusing on the crisis at hand.

Upon receiving the purser's update on the co-pilot's injury, Evelina's expression turned grave. She immediately requested lan to fetch a windproof jacket for Jasper.

The purser, who had planned to send Evelina into the cockpit because the co-pilot was confined to his post, was taken aback by her request.

He makes coffee all day and is a shift lead. He has always gotten along with women and is friendly and has a lot of sisters. It has never bothered me that he makes friends with women. At his old job he has a few female friends but also his main friend was a guy, they would all hang out and it was fine to me. But now that we live here none of the men he really connects with. There is two girls one is Jovi and the other is Jodi. I always get them mixed up but never thought much about it. The other night he told me he was gunna go hang out with a group of co workers and he did they hung out for hours and around 1 am I was like where are you I thought you’d be home and he was like oh I’m still here but everyone left and I asked who he was with and it was with Jovi ( which I thought was a lesbian but apparently that’s JODI ) and he was playing Roblox with her in the park at fucking 1am?! So they came back home and I was clearly upset and he just thinks I’m being irrational. So I dropped it. But as my friend is staying for a week this week, around Wednesday he tells me he’s going to hang out with Jovi again on Saturday and I told him it hurts my feelings because she’s 19 and I’m wondering why he wants to hang out with a 19 year old. He told me she has issues at home and just wants a place to be at night where her family isn’t yelling and I’m like why doesn’t she have friends she grew up here to hang out with? Also they send each other reels on Instagram and yeah like he is in a lot of group chats with his family too but why is he also sending her reels?? I have to mention too we don’t fight all the time, we have such a healthy communicative relationship and we are very active in the bedroom. When I confronted him about it right now as he was getting ready he looked so hurt and was like really?? “ Can I not be my own person and go hang out with friends?” Which he’s never spoken to me like this before but I still can’t help but feel really hurt he’s going to hang out with a girl. Also it’s my friends last day here and we are getting ready to go to the Cheesecake Factory but he’s walking the dog and coming back to go hang out with her. 
Am I over reacting? I know it’s healthy for him to have other friends but I feel seriously insecure and jealous because this feels like something that happens and I don’t wanna be blind and act fine when what if she’s attracted to him or he’s attracted to her.

1lyhvx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lyhvx2/the_hobbit_by_j_r_r_tolkien/,The Hobbit  by J. R. R. Tolkien,"Chapter 1 An Unexpected Party  
  
  In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.  
  
  It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats - the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill - The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it - and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.  
  
  This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but he gained-well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.  
  
  The mother of our particular hobbit. . . what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be at in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this hobbit - of Bilbo Baggins, that is - was the fabulous Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbit-like about them, - and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer. Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo's father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly with her money) that was to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to the end of their days. Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his makeup from the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. The chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his father, which I have just described for you, until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably.  
  
  By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed) - Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort I of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion. He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not since his friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like. He had been away over The Hill and across The Water on business of his own since they were all small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls.  
  
  All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots. ""Good morning!"" said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat. ""What do you mean?"" be said. ""Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is morning to be good on?""  
  
  ""All of them at once,"" said Bilbo. ""And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine! There's no hurry, we have all the day before us!"" Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill.  
  
  ""Very pretty!"" said Gandalf. ""But I have no time to blow smoke-rings this morning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it's very difficult to find anyone. ""  
  
  I should think so - in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them, said our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smoke-ring. Then he took out his morning letters, and begin to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.  
  
  ""Good morning!"" he said at last. ""We don't want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water. "" By this he meant that the conversation was at an end.  
  
  ""What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!"" said Gandalf. ""Now you mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off. ""  
  
  ""Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don't think I know your name?""  
  
  ""Yes, yes, my dear sir - and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name, though you don't remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I should have lived to be good-morninged by Belladonna Took's son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!"" ""Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows' sons? Not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve. S  
plendid! They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!"" You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. ""Dear me!"" she went on. ""Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures. Anything from climbing trees to visiting Elves - or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter - I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business. "" ""Where else should I be?"" said the wizard. ""All the same I am pleased to find you remember something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, land that is not without hope. Indeed for your old grand-father Took's sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for. ""  
  
  ""I beg your pardon, I haven't asked for anything!""  
  
  ""Yes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go so far as to send you on this adventure. Very amusing for me, very good for you and profitable too, very likely, if you ever get over it. ""  
  
  ""Sorry! I don't want any adventures, thank you. Not today. Good morning!  
  
  But please come to tea - any time you like! Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow!  
  
  Good-bye!""  
  
  With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door, and shut it as quickly as he dared, not to seen rude. Wizards after all are wizards.  
  
  ""What on earth did I ask him to tea for!"" he said to him-self, as he went  
  
  to the pantry. He had only just had break fast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do him good after his fright. Gandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the door, and laughing long but quietly. After a while he stepped up, and with the spike of his staff scratched a queer sign on the hobbit's beautiful green front-door. Then he strode away, just about the time when Bilbo was finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he had escape adventures very well.  
  
  The next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf. He did not remember things very well, unless he put them down on his Engagement Tablet: like this:  
  
  Gandalf 'a Wednesday. Yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of the kind. Just before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and then he remembered! He rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and saucer and an extra cake or two, and ran to the door. ""I am so sorry to keep you waiting!"" he was going to say, when he saw that it was not Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, and very bright eyes under his dark-green hood. As soon a the door was opened, he pushed inside, just as if he had been expected. He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and ""Dwalin at your service!"" he said with a low bow.  
  
  ""Bilbo Baggins at yours!"" said the hobbit, too surprised to ask any questions for the moment. When the silence that followed had become uncomfortable, he added: ""I am just about to take tea; pray come and have some with me. "" A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation?  
  
  They had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, when there came another even louder ring at the bell. ""Excuse me!"" said the hobbit, and off he went to the door. ""So you have got here at last!"" was what he was going to say to Gandalf this time. But it was not Gandalf. Instead there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open, just as if he had been invited. ""I see they have begun to arrive already,"" he said when he caught sight of Dwalin's green hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it, and ""Balin at your service!"" he said with his hand on his breast.  
  
  ""Thank you!"" said Bilbo with a gasp. It was not the correct thing to say, but they have begun to arrive had flustered him badly. He liked visitors, but he liked to know them before they arrived, and he preferred to ask them himself. He had a horrible thought that the cakes might run short, and then he-as the host: he knew his duty and stuck to it however painful-he might have to go without.  
  
  ""Come along in, and have some tea!"" he managed to say after taking a deep breath.  
  
  ""A little beer would suit me better, if it is all the same to you, my good sir,"" said Balin with the white beard. ""But I don't mind some cake-seed-cake, if you have any. ""  
  
  ""Lots!"" Bilbo found himself answering, to his own surprise; and he found himself scuttling off, too, to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and to the pantry to fetch two beautiful round seed-cakes which he had baked that afternoon for his after-supper morsel.  
  
  When he got back Balin and Dwalin were talking at the table like old friends (as a matter of fact they were brothers). Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them, when loud came a ring at the bell again, and then another ring.  
  
  ""Gandalf for certain this time,"" he thought as he puffed along the passage. But it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards; and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade. In they hopped, as soon as the door began to open-Bilbo was hardly surprised at all.  
  
  ""What can I do for you, my dwarves?"" he said. ""Kili at your service!""  
  
  said the one. ""And Fili!"" added the other; and they both swept off their blue hoods and bowed.  
  
  ""At yours and your family's!"" replied Bilbo, remembering his manners this time.  
  
  ""Dwalin and Balin here already, I see,"" said Kili. ""Let us join the throng!""  
  
  ""Throng!"" thought Mr. Baggins. ""I don't like the sound of that. I really must sit down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a drink. "" He had only just had a sip-in the corner, while the four dwarves sat around the table, and talked about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins, and the depredations of dragons, and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for they sounded much too adventurous-when, ding-dong-a-ling-' dang, his bell rang again, as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. ""Someone at the door!"" he said, blinking. ""Some four, I should say by the sound,"" said Fili. ""Be-sides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance. ""  
  
  The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands, and wondered what had happened, and what was going to happen, and whether they would all stay to supper. Then the bell rang again louder than ever, and he had to run to the door. It was not four after all, it was FIVE. Another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, be-x)re they were all inside, bowing and saying ""at your service"" one after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were their names; and very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to join the others. Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee, and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while. A big jug of coffee bad just been set in the hearth, the seed-cakes were gone, and the dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones, when there came-a loud knock. Not a ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit's beautiful green door. Somebody was banging with a stick!  
  
  Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and altogether bewildered and bewuthered-this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More dwarves, four more! And there was Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before. ""Carefully! Carefully!"" he said. ""It is not like you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, and then open the door like a pop-gun! Let me introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!"" ""At your service!"" said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they hung up two yellow h  
oods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself, who was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted ""pray don't mention it,"" and stopped frowning.  
  
  ""Now we are all here!"" said Gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods-the best detachable party hoods-and his own hat hanging on the pegs. ""Quite a merry gathering!  
  
  I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What's that? Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think, for me. "" ""And for me,"" said Thorin. ""And raspberry jam and apple-tart,"" said Bifur. ""And mince-pies and cheese,"" said Bofur. ""And pork-pie and salad,"" said Bombur. ""And more cakes-and ale-and coffee, if you don't mind,"" called the other dwarves through the door.  
  
  ""Put on a few eggs, there's a good fellow!"" Gandalf called after him, as  
  
  the hobbit stumped off to the pantries. ""And just bring out the cold chicken and pickles!""  
  
  ""Seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as I do myself!"" thought Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house. By the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, he was getting very hot, and red in the face, and annoyed.  
  
  ""Confusticate and bebother these dwarves!"" he said aloud. ""Why don't they come and lend a hand?"" Lo and behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door of the kitchen, and Fili and Kili behind them, and before he could say knife they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlour and set out everything afresh.  
  
  Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen, dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away), and trying to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and. not in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. At last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and glasses. ""I suppose you will all stay to supper?"" he said in his politest unpressing tones. ""Of course!"" said Thorin. ""And after. We shan't get through the business till late, and we must have some music first. Now to clear up!"" Thereupon the twelve dwarves-not Thorin, he was too important, and stayed talking to Gandalf-jumped to their feet and made tall piles of all the things. Off they went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on the top, with one hand, while the hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with fright: ""please be careful!"" and ""please, don't trouble! I can manage. "" But the dwarves only started to sing:  
  
  ""Chip the glasses and crack the plates!  
  
  Blunt the knives and bend the forks!  
  
  That's what Bilbo Baggins hates-  
  
  Smash the bottles and burn the corks!  
  
  Cut the cloth and tread on the fat!  
  
  Pour the milk on the pantry floor!  
  
  Leave the bones on the bedroom mat!  
  
  Splash the wine on every door!  
  
  Dump the crocks in a boiling bawl;  
  
  Pound them up with a thumping pole;  
  
  And when you've finished, if any are whole,  
  
  Send them down the hall to roll !  
  
  That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!  
  
  So, carefully! carefully with the plates!""  
  
  And of course they did none of these dreadful things, and everything was cleaned and put away safe as quick as lightning, while the hobbit was turning round and round in the middle of the kitchen trying to see what they were doing. Then they went back, and found Thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a pipe. He was blowing the most enormous smoke-rings, and wherever he told one to go, it went-up the chimney, or behind the clock on the man-telpiece, or under the table, or round and round the ceiling; but wherever it went it was not quick enough to escape Gandalf. Pop! he sent a smaller smoke-ring from his short clay-pipe straight through each one of Thorin's. The Gandalf's smoke-ring would go green and come back to hover over the wizard's head. He had quite a cloud of them about him already, and in the dim light it made him look strange and sorcerous. Bilbo stood still and watched-he loved smoke-rings-and then be blushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the smoke-rings he had sent up the wind over The Hill. ""Now for some music!"" said Thorin. ""Bring out the instruments!""  
  
  Kili and Fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles;  
  
  Dori, Nori, and Ori brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats; Bombur produced a drum from the hall; Bifur and Bofur went out too, and came back with clarinets that they had left among the walking-sticks Dwalin and Balin said: ""Excuse me, I left mine in the porch!"" ""Just bring mine in with you,"" said Thorin. They came back with viols as big as themselves, and with Thorin's harp wrapped in a green cloth. It was a beautiful gold-en harp, and when Thorin struck it the music began all at once, so sudden and sweet that Bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept away into dark lands under strange moons, far over The Water and very far from his hobbit-hole under The Hill. The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of The Hill; the firelight flickered-it was April-and still they played on, while the shadow of Gandalf's beard wagged against the wall. The dark filled all the room, and the fire died down, and the shadows were lost, and still they played on. And suddenly first one and then another began to sing as they played, deep-throated singing of the dwarves in the deep places of their ancient homes; and this is like a fragment of their song, if it can be like their song without their music.  
  
  ""Far over the misty mountains cold  
  
  To dungeons deep and caverns old  
  
  We must away ere break of day  
  
  To seek the pale enchanted gold.  
  
  The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,  
  
  While hammers fell like ringing bells  
  
  In places deep, where dark things sleep,  
  
  In hollow halls beneath the fells.  
  
  For ancient king and elvish lord  
  
  There many a gloaming golden hoard  
  
  They shaped and wrought, and light they caught  
  
  To hide in gems on hilt of sword.  
  
  On silver necklaces they strung  
  
  The flowering stars, on crowns they hung  
  
  The dragon-fire, in twisted wire  
  
  They meshed the light of moon and sun.  
  
  Far over the misty mountains cold  
  
  To dungeons deep and caverns old  
  
  We must away, ere break of day,  
  
  To claim our long-forgotten gold.  
  
  Goblets they carved there for themselves  
  
  And harps of gold; where no man delves  
  
  There lay they long, and many a song  
  
  Was sung unheard by men or elves.  
  
  The pines were roaring on the height,  
  
  The winds were moaning in the night.  
  
  The fire was red, it flaming spread;  
  
  The trees like torches biased with light,  
  
  The bells were ringing in the dale  
  
  And men looked up with faces pale;  
  
  The dragon's ire more fierce than fire  
  
  Laid low their towers and houses frail.  
  
  The mountain smoked beneath the moon;  
  
  The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.  
  
  They fled their hall to dying -fall  
  
  Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.  
  
  Far over the misty mountains grim  
  
  To dungeons deep and caverns dim  
  
  We must away, ere break of day,  
  
  To win our harps and gold from him!""  
  
  As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands  
  
  and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the desire of the h  
earts of dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick. He looked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly in the wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up - probably somebody lighting a wood-fire-and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and kindling it all to flames. He shuddered; and very quickly he was plain Mr. Baggins of Bag-End, Under-Hill, again. He got up trembling. He had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp, and more than half a mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the beer barrels in the cellar, and not come out again until all the dwarves had gone away. Suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at him with eyes shining in the dark.  
  
  ""Where are you going?"" said Thorin, in a tone that seemed to show that he guessed both halves of the hobbit's mind.  
  
  ""What about a little light?"" said Bilbo apologetically.  
  
  ""We like the dark,"" said the dwarves. ""Dark for dark business! There are many hours before dawn. ""  
  
  ""Of course!"" said Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. He missed the stool and sat in the fender, knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash. ""Hush!"" said Gandalf. ""Let Thorin speak!"" And this is bow Thorin began. ""Gandalf, dwarves and Mr. Baggins! We are not together in the house of our friend and fellow conspirator, this most excellent and audacious hobbit-may the hair on his toes never fall out! all praise to his wine and ale!-"" He paused for breath and for a polite remark from the hob-bit, but the compliments were quite lost on-poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no noise came out, he was so flummoxed. So Thorin went on:  
  
  ""We are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy and devices. We shall soon before the break of day start on our long journey, a journey from which some of us, or perhaps all of us (except our friend and counsellor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object is, I take it, well known to us all. To the estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps to one or two of the younger dwarves (I think I should be right in naming Kili and Fili, for instance), the exact situation at the moment may require a little brief explanation-"" This was Thorin's style. He was an important dwarf. If he had been allowed, he would probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath, without telling any one there 'anything that was not known already. But he was rudely interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn't bear it any longer. At may never return he began to feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang Bp knocking over the table. Gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his magic staff, and in its firework glare the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the hearth-rug, shaking like a jelly that was melting. Then he fell flat on the floor, and kept on calling out ""struck by lightning, struck by lightning!"" over and over again; and that was all they could get out of him for a long time. So they took him and laid him out of the way on the drawing-room sofa with a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark business.  
  
  ""Excitable little fellow,"" said Gandalf, as they sat down again. ""Gets funny queer fits, but he is one of the best, one of the best-as fierce as a dragon in a pinch. ""  
  
  If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realise that this was  
  
  only poetical exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to Old Took's great-  
  
  granduncle Bullroarer, who was so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a  
  
  horse. He charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of the  
  
  Green Fields, and knocked their king Gol-firnbul's head clean off with a  
  
  wooden club. It sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole, and in this way the battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment.  
  
  In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer's gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing-room. After a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the parlour. This is what he heard, Gloin speaking: ""Humph!"" (or some snort more or less like that). ""Will he do, do you think? It is all very well for Gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement would be enough to wake the dragon and all his relatives, and kill the lot of us. I think it sounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it bad not been for the sign on the door, I should have been sure we had come to the wrong house. As soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing on the mat, I had my doubts. He looks more like a grocer-than a burglar!""  
  
  Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The Took side had won. He suddenly felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce. As for little fellow bobbing on the mat it almost made him really fierce. Many a time afterwards the Baggins part regretted what he did now, and he said to himself: ""Bilbo, you were a fool; you walked right in and put your foot in it. ""  
  
  ""Pardon me,"" he said, ""if I have overheard words that you were saying. I don't pretend to understand what you are talking about, or your reference to burglars, but I think I am right in believing"" (this is what he called being on his dignity) ""that you think I am no good. I will show you. I have no signs on my door-it was painted a week ago-, and I am quite sure you have come to the wrong house. As soon as I saw your funny faces on the door-step, I had my doubts. But treat it as the right one. Tell me what you want done, and I will try it, if I have to walk from here to the East of East and fight the wild Were-worms in the Last Desert. I bad a great-great-great-granduncle once, Bullroarer Took, and -"" ""Yes, yes, but that was long ago,"" said Gloin. ""I was talking about you. And I assure you there is a mark on this door-the usual one in the trade, or used to be. Burglar wants a good job, plenty of Excitement and reasonable Reward, that's how it is usually read. You \^an say Expert Treasure-hunter instead of Burglar if you like. Some of them do. It's all the same to us. Gandalf told us that there was a man of the sort in these parts looking for a Job at once, and that he had arranged for a meeting here this Wednesday tea-time. ""  
  
  ""Of course there is a mark,"" said Gandalf. ""I put it there myself. For very good reasons. You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins. Just let any one say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like, or go back to digging coal. ""  
  
  He scowled so angrily at Gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair; and when Bilbo tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he turned and frowned at him and stuck oat his bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap. ""That's right,"" said Gandalf. ""Let's have no more argument. I have chosen Mr. Baggins and that ought to !6te enough for all of you. If I say he is a Burglar, a Burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you guess, and a deal more than he has any idea of himself. You may (possibly) all live to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my boy, fetch the lamp, and let's have little light on this!""  
  
  On the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shad he spread a piece of parchment rather like a map.  
  
  ""This was made by Thror, your grandfather, Thorin, he said in answer to the dwarves' excited questions. ""It is a plan of the Mountain. "" ""I don't see that this will help us much,"" said Thorin disappointedly after a glance. ""I remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about it. And I know where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the great dragons bred. ""  
  
  ""There is a dragon marked in red on the Mountain, said Balin, ""but it will be easy enough to find him without that, if ever we arrive there. "" ""There is one point that you haven't noticed,"" said the wizard, ""and that is the secret entrance. You see that rune on the West side, and the hand pointing to it from the other runes? That marks a hidden passage to the Lower Halls.  
  
  ""It may have been secret once,"" said Thorin, ""but how d  
o we know that it is secret any longer? Old Smaug had lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves. ""  
  
  ""He may-but he can't have used it for years and years. ""Why?"" ""Because it is too small. 'Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast' say the runes, but Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he was a young dragon, certainly not after devouring so many of the dwarves and men of Dale. ""  
  
  ""It seems a great big hole to me,"" squeaked Bilbo (who had no experience of dragons and only of hobbit-holes) He was getting excited and interested again, so that he forgot to keep his mouth shut. He loved maps, and in his hall there hung a large one of the Country Round with all his favourite walks marked on it in red ink. ""How could such a large door be kept secret from everybody outside, apart from the dragon?"" he asked. He was only a little hobbit you must remember.  
  
  ""In lots of ways,"" said Gandalf. ""But in what way this one has been hidden we don't know without going to see. From what it says on the map I should guess there is a closed door which has been made to look exactly like the side of the Mountain. That is the usual dwarves' method - I think that is right, isn't it?"" ""Quite right,"" said Thorin.  
  
  ""Also,"" went on Gandalf, ""I forgot to mention that with the map went a key, a small and curious key. Here it is!"" he said, and handed to Thorin a key with a long barrel and intricate wards, made of silver. ""Keep it safe!"" ""Indeed I will,"" said Thorin, and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck and under his jacket. ""Now things begin to look more hopeful. This news alters them much for-the better. So far we have had no clear idea what to do. We thought of going East, as quiet and careful as we could, as far as the Long Lake. After that the trouble would begin. "" ""A long time before that, if I know anything about the loads East,"" interrupted Gandalf.  
  
  ""We might go from there up along the River Running,"" went on Thorin taking no notice, ""and so to the ruins of Dale-the old town in the valley there, under the shadow of the Mountain. But we none of us liked the idea of the Front Gate. The river runs right out of it through the great cliff at the South of the Mountain, and out of it comes the dragon too-far too often, unless he has changed. ""  
  
  ""That would be no good,"" said the wizard, ""not without a mighty Warrior, even a Hero. I tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in distant lands, and in this neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply lot to be found. Swords in these parts are mostly blunt, and axes are used for trees, and shields as cradles or dish-covers; and dragons are comfortably far-off (and therefore legendary). That is why I settled on burglary-especially when I remembered the existence of a Side-door. And here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. So now let's get on and make some plans. ""  
  
  ""Very well then,"" said Thorin, ""supposing the burglar-expert gives us some ideas or suggestions. "" He turned with mock-politeness to Bilbo. ""First I should like to know a bit more about things,"" said he, feeling all confused and a bit shaky inside, but so far still lookishly determined to go on with things. ""I mean about the gold and the dragon, and all that, and how it got there, and who it belongs to, and so on and further. "" ""Bless me!"" said Thorin, ""haven't you got a map? and didn't you hear our song? and haven't we been talking about all this for hours?""  
  
  ""All the same, I should like it all plain and clear,"" said he  
  
  obstinately, putting on his business manner (usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money off him), and doing his best to appear wise and prudent and professional and live up to Gandalf's recommendation. ""Also I should like to know about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time required and remuneration, and so forth""-by which he meant: ""What am I going to get out of it? and am I going to come back alive?""  
  
  ""O very well,"" said Thorin. ""Long ago in my grandfather Thror's time our family was driven out of the far North, and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this Mountain on the map. It had been discovered by my far ancestor, Thrain the Old, but now they mined and they tunnelled and they made huger halls and greater workshops -and in addition I believe they found a good deal of gold and a great many jewels too. Anyway they grew immensely rich and famous, and my grandfather was King under the Mountain again and treated with great reverence by the mortal men, who lived to the South, and were gradually spreading up the Running River as far as the valley overshadowed by the Mountain. They built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings used to send for our smiths, and reward even the least skilful most richly. Fathers would beg us to take their sons as apprentices, and pay us handsomely, especially in food-supplies, which we never bothered to grow or find for ourselves. Altogether those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just for the. fun of it, not to speak of the most marvellous and magical toys, the like of which is not to be found in the world now-a-days. So my grandfather's halls became full of armour and jewels and carvings and cups, and the toy-market of Dale was the wonder of the North.

1lyhuhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lyhuhj/sea_swept_by_nora_roberts/,Sea Swept  by Nora Roberts:,"Cameron Quinn wasn't quite drunk. He could get there if he put his mind to it, but at the moment he preferred the nice comfortable buzz of the nearly there. He liked to think it was just the two-steps-short-of-sloppy state that was holding his luck steady.  
  
  He believed absolutely in the ebb and flow of luck, and right now his was flowing fast and hot. Just the day before, he'd raced his hydrofoil to victory in the world championship, edging out the competition by the point of the bow and breaking the standing record for time and speed.  
  
  He had the glory, and the hefty purse, and he'd taken both over to Monte Carlo to see how they held up.  
  
  They held up just dandy.  
  
  A few hands of baccarat, a couple of rolls of the dice, the turn of a card, and his wallet weighed heavier. Between the paparazzi and a reporter from Sports Illustrated, the glory showed no signs of dimming either.  
  
  Fortune continued to smile—no, make that leer, Cameron thought—by turning him toward that little jewel in the Med at the same time that popular magazine was wrapping its swimsuit-edition shoot.  
  
  And the leggiest of those long-stemmed gifts from God had turned her high-summer blue eyes on him, tipped her full, pouty lips up in an invitational smile a blind man could have spotted, and opted to stay on a few days longer.  
  
  And she'd made it clear that with very little effort, he could get a whole lot luckier.  
  
  Champagne, generous casinos, mindless, no-strings sex. Yes indeed, Cameron mused, luck was definitely being his kind of lady.  
  
  When they stepped out of the casino into the balmy March night, one of the ubiquitous paparazzi leaped out, snapping frantically. The woman pouted—it was, after all, her trademark look—but gave her endless mane of ribbon-straight silvery-blond hair an artful toss and shifted her killer body expertly. Her red-is-the-color-of-sin dress, barely thicker than a coat of paint, made an abrupt halt just south of the Gates of Paradise.  
  
  Cameron just grinned.  
  
  ""They're such pests,"" she said with a hint of a lisp or a French accent. Cameron was never sure which. She sighed, testing the strength of that thin silk, and let Cameron guide her down the moon-dappled street. ""Every place I look is a camera. I'm so weary of being viewed as an object for the pleasure of men.""  
  
  Oh, yeah, right, he mused. And because he figured the pair of them were as shallow as a dry creek after a drought, he laughed and turned her into his arms. ""Why don't we give him something to splash on page one, sugar?""  
  
  He brought his mouth down to hers. The taste of her tickled his hormones, engaged his imagination, and made him grateful their hotel was only two blocks away.  
  
  She skimmed her fingers up into his hair. She liked a man with plenty of hair, and his was full and thick and as dark as the night around them. His body was hard, all tough muscle and lean, disciplined lines. She was very choosy about the body of a potential lover, and his more than met her strict requirements.  
  
  His hands were just a bit rougher than she liked. Not the pressure or movement of them—that was lovely—but the texture. They were a working man's hands, but she was willing to overlook their lack of class because of their skill.  
  
  His face was intriguing. Not pretty. She would never be coupled, much less allow herself to be photographed, with a man prettier than she. There was a toughness about his face, a hardness that had to do with more than tanned skin tight over bones. It was in the eyes, she thought as she laughed lightly and wiggled free. They were gray, more the color of flint than smoke, and they held secrets.  
  
  She enjoyed a man with secrets, as none of them were able to keep them from her for long.  
  
  ""You're a bad boy, Cameron."" The accent was on the last syllable. She tapped a finger against his mouth, a mouth that held no softness whatsoever.  
  
  ""So I've always been told—"" He had to think for a moment as her name skimmed along the edges of his memory. ""Martine.""  
  
  ""Maybe, tonight, I'll let you be bad.""  
  
  ""I'm counting on it, sweetie."" He turned toward the hotel, slanted a glance over. At six feet, she was nearly eye to eye with him. ""My suite or yours?""  
  
  ""Yours."" She all but purred it. ""Perhaps if you order up another bottle of champagne, I'll let you try to seduce me.""  
  
  Cameron cocked an eyebrow, asked for his key at the desk. ""I'll need a bottle of Cristal, two glasses, and one red rose,"" he told the clerk while keeping his eyes on Martine. ""Right away.""  
  
  ""Yes, Monsieur Quinn, I'll take care of it.""  
  
  ""A rose."" She fluttered at him as they walked to the elevator. ""How romantic.""  
  
  ""Oh, did you want one too?"" Her puzzled smile warned him humor wasn't going to be her strong point. So they'd forget the laughs and conversation, he decided, and shoot straight for the bottom line.  
  
  The minute the elevator doors closed them in, he pulled her against him and met that sulky mouth with his own. He was hungry. He'd been too busy, too focused on his boat, too angled in on the race to take any time for recreation. He wanted soft skin, fragrant skin, curves, generous curves. A woman, any woman, as long as she was willing, experienced, and knew the boundary lines.  
  
  That made Martine perfect.  
  
  She let out a moan that wasn't altogether feigned for his benefit, then arched her throat for his nipping teeth. ""You go fast.""  
  
  He slid his hand down the silk, up again. ""That's how I make my living. Going fast. Every time. Every way.""  
  
  Still holding her, he circled out of the elevator, down the corridor to his rooms. Her heart was rapping hard against his, her breath catching, and her hands… well, he figured she knew just what she was doing with them.  
  
  So much for seduction.  
  
  He unlocked the door, shoved it open, then closed it by bracing Martine against it. He pushed the two string-width straps off her shoulders and with his eyes on hers helped himself to those magnificent breasts.  
  
  He decided her plastic surgeon deserved a medal.  
  
  ""You want slow?""  
  
  Yes, the texture of his hands was rough, but God, exciting. She brought one mile-long leg up, wrapped it around his waist. He had to give her full marks for a sense of balance. ""I want now.""  
  
  ""Good. Me too."" He reached up under her excuse for a skirt and ripped away the whisper of lace beneath. Her eyes went wide, her breath thickened.  
  
  ""Animal. Beast"" And she fastened her teeth in his throat.  
  
  Even as he reached for his fly, the knock sounded discreetly on the door behind her head. Every ounce of blood had drained out of his head to below his belt. ""Christ, service can't be that good here. Leave it outside,"" he demanded and prepared to take the magnificent Martine against the door.  
  
  ""Monsieur Quinn, I beg your pardon. A fax just came for you. It was marked urgent.""  
  
  ""Tell him to go away."" Martine wrapped a hand around him like a clamp. ""Tell him to go to hell and fuck me.""  
  
  ""Hold on. I mean,"" he continued, unwrapping her fingers before his eyes could cross. ""Wait just a minute."" He shifted her behind the door, took a second to be sure he was zipped, then opened it.  
  
  ""I'm sorry to disturb—""  
  
  ""No problem. Thanks."" Cameron dug in his pocket for a bill, didn't bother to check the denomination, and traded it for the envelope. Before the clerk could babble over the amount of the tip, Cameron shut the door in his face.  
  
  Martine gave that famous head toss again. ""You're more interested in a silly fax than me. Than this."" With an expert hand, she tugged the dress down, wiggling free of it like a snake shedding skin.  
  
  Cameron decided whatever she'd paid for that body, it had been worth every penny. ""No, believe me, baby, I'm not. This'll just take a second."" He ripped the envelope open before he could give in to the urge to ball it up, toss it over his shoulder, and dive headlong into all that female glory.  
  
  Then he read the message and his world, his life, his heart stopped.  
  
  ""O  
h, Jesus. Goddamn."" All the wine cheerfully consumed throughout the evening swam giddily in his head, churned in his stomach, turned his knees to water. He had to lean back against the door to steady himself before reading it again.  
  
  Cam, damn it, why haven't you returned a call? We've been trying to reach you for hours. Dad's in the hospital. It's bad, as bad as it gets. No time for details. We're losing him fast. Hurry. Phillip.  
  
  Cameron lifted a hand—one that had held the wheel of dozens of boats, planes, cars that raced, one that could show a woman shuddery glimpses of heaven. And the hand shook as he dragged it through his hair.  
  
  ""I have to go home.""  
  
  ""You are home."" Martine decided to give him another chance and stepped forward to rub her body over his.  
  
  ""No, I have to go."" He nudged her aside and headed for the phone. ""You have to go. I need to make some calls.""  
  
  ""You think you can tell me to go?""  
  
  ""Sorry. Rain check."" His mind just wouldn't engage. Absently he pulled bills out of his pocket with one hand, picked up the phone with the other. ""Cab fare,"" he said, forgetting she was booked in the same hotel.  
  
  ""Pig!"" Naked and furious, she launched herself at him. If he had been steady, he'd have dodged the blow. But the slap connected, and the quick swipe. His ears rang, his cheek stung, and his patience snapped.  
  
  Cameron simply locked his arms around her, revolted when she took that as a sexual overture, and carted her to the door. He took the time to scoop up her dress, then tossed both the woman and the silk into the hall.  
  
  Her shriek rattled the teeth in his head as he threw the bolt. ""I'll kill you. You pig! You bastard! I'll kill you for this. Who do you think you are? You're nothing! Nothing!""  
  
  He left Martine screaming and pounding at the door and went into the bedroom to throw a few necessities into a bag.  
  
  It looked like luck had just taken the nastiest of turns.  
 cam called in markers, pulled strings, begged favors, and threw money in a dozen directions. Hooking transportation from Monaco to Maryland's Eastern Shore at one o'clock in the morning wasn't an easy matter.  
  
  He drove to Nice, bulleting down the winding coastal highway to a small airstrip where a friend had agreed to fly him to Paris—for the nominal fee of a thousand American dollars. In Paris he chartered a plane, for half again the going rate, and spent the hours over the Atlantic in a blur of fatigue and gnawing fear.  
  
  He arrived at Washington Dulles Airport in Virginia at just after six A.M. eastern standard time. The rental car was waiting, so he began the drive to the Chesapeake Bay in the dark chill of predawn.  
  
  By the time he hit the bridge crossing the bay, the sun was up and bright, sparkling off the water, glinting off boats already out for the day's catch. Cam had spent a good part of his life sailing on the bay, on the rivers and inlets of this part of the world. The man he was racing to see had shown him much more than port and starboard.  
  
  Whatever he had, whatever he'd done that he could take pride in, he owed to Raymond Quinn.  
  
  He'd been thirteen and racing toward hell when Ray and Stella Quinn had plucked him out of the system. His juvenile record was already a textbook study of the roots of the career criminal.  
  
  Robbery, breaking and entering, underage drinking, truancy, assault, vandalism, malicious mischief. He'd done as he'd pleased and even then had often enjoyed long runs of luck where he hadn't been caught. But the luckiest moment of his life had been being caught.  
  
  Thirteen years old, skinny as a rail and still wearing the bruises from the last beating his father had administered. They'd been out of beer. What was a father to do?  
  
  On that hot summer night with the blood still drying on his face, Cam had promised himself he was never going back to that run-down trailer, to that life, to the man the system kept tossing him back to. He was going somewhere, anywhere. Maybe California, maybe Mexico.  
  
  His dreams had been big even if his vision, courtesy of a blackened eye, was blurry. He had fifty-six dollars and some loose change, the clothes on his back, and a piss-poor attitude. What he needed, he decided, was transportation.  
  
  He copped a ride in the cargo car of a train heading out of Baltimore. He didn't know where it was going and didn't care as long as it was away. Huddled in the dark, his body weeping at every bump, he promised himself he'd kill or he'd die before he went back.  
  
  When he crept off the train, he smelled water and fish, and he wished to God he'd thought to grab some food somewhere. His stomach was screamingly empty. Dizzy and disoriented, he began to walk.  
  
  There wasn't much there. A two-bit little town that had rolled up its streets for the night. Boats bumping at sagging docks. If his mind had been clear, he might have considered breaking into one of the shops that lined the water front, but it didn't occur to him until he had passed through town and found himself skirting a marsh.  
  
  The marsh's shadows and sounds gave him the willies. The sun was beginning to break through the eastern sky, turning those muddy flats and that high, wet grass gold. A huge white bird rose up, making Cam's heart skip. He'd never seen a heron before, and he thought it looked like something out of a book, a made-up one.  
  
  But the wings flashed, and the bird soared. For reasons he couldn't name, he followed it along the edge of the marsh until it disappeared into thick trees.  
  
  He lost track of how far and what direction, but instinct told him to keep to a narrow country road where he could easily tuck himself into the high grass or behind a tree if a black-and-white cruised by.  
  
  He badly wanted to find shelter, somewhere he could curl up and sleep, sleep away the pangs of hunger and the greasy nausea. As the sun rose higher, the air grew thick with heat. His shirt stuck to his back; his feet began to weep.  
  
  He saw the car first, a glossy white 'Vette, all power and grace, sitting like a grand prize in the misty light of dawn. There was a pickup beside it, rusted, rugged and ridiculously rural beside the arrogant sophistication of the car.  
  
  Cam crouched down behind a lushly blooming hydrangea and studied it. Lusted after it.  
  
  The son of a bitch would get him to Mexico, all right, and anywhere else he wanted to go. Shit, the way a machine like that would move, he'd be halfway there before anybody knew it was gone.  
  
  He shifted, blinked hard to clear his wavering vision, and stared at the house. It always amazed him that people lived so neatly. In tidy houses with painted shutters, flowers and trimmed bushes in the yard. Rockers on the front porch, screens on the windows. The house seemed huge to him, a modern white palace with soft blue trim.  
  
  They'd be rich, he decided, as resentment ground in his stomach along with hunger. They could afford fancy houses and fancy cars and fancy lives. And a part of him, a part nurtured by a man who lived on hate and Budweiser, wanted to destroy, to beat all the bushes flat, to break all the shiny windows and gouge the pretty painted wood to splinters.  
  
  He wanted to hurt them somehow for having everything while he had nothing. But as he rose, the bitter fury wavered into sick dizziness. He clamped down on it, clenching his teeth until they, too, ached, but his head cleared.  
  
  Let the rich bastards sleep, he thought. He'd just relieve them of the hot car. Wasn't even locked, he noted and snorted at their ignorance as he eased the door open. One of the more useful skills his father had passed on to him was how to hot-wire a car quickly and quietly. Such a skill came in very handy when a man made the best part of his living selling stolen cars to chop shops.  
  
  Cam leaned in, shimmied under the wheel, and got to work.  
  
  ""It takes balls to steal a man's car right out of his own driveway.""  
  
  Before Cam could react, even so much as swear, a hand hooked into the back of his jeans and hauled him up and out. He swung out, and his bunched fist seemed to bounce off rock.  
  
  He got his first look at the Mighty Quinn. The man was huge, at least six-five and built like the offensive line of the Baltimore Colts. His face was weathered and wide,  
with a thick shock of blond hair that glinted with silver surrounding it. His eyes were piercingly blue and hotly annoyed.  
  
  Then they narrowed.  
  
  It didn't take much to hold the boy in place. He couldn't have weighed a hundred pounds, Quinn thought, if he'd fished the kid out of the bay. His face was filthy and badly battered. One eye was nearly swollen shut, while the other, dark slate gray, held a bitterness no child should feel.  
  
  There was blood dried on the mouth that managed to sneer despite it.  
  
  Pity and anger stirred in him, but he kept his grip firm. This rabbit, he knew, would run.  
  
  ""Looks like you came out on the wrong end of the tussle, son.""  
  
  ""Get your fucking hands off me. I wasn't doing nothing.""  
  
  Ray merely lifted a brow. ""You were in my wife's new car at just past seven on a Saturday morning.""  
  
  ""I was just looking for some loose change. What's the big fucking deal?""  
  
  ""You don't want to get in the habit of overusing the word 'fuck' as an adjective. You'll miss the vast variety of its uses.""  
  
  The mildly tutorial tone was well over Cam's head. ""Look, Jack, I was just hoping for a couple bucks in quarters. You wouldn't miss it.""  
  
  ""No, but Stella would have dearly missed this car if you'd finished hot-wiring it. And my name isn't Jack. It's Ray. Now, the way I figure it you've got a couple of choices. Let's outline number one: I haul your sorry butt into the house and call the cops. How do you feel about doing the next few years in a juvenile facility for badasses?""  
  
  Whatever color Cam had left in his face drained away. His empty stomach heaved, his palms suddenly covered in sweat. He couldn't stand a cage. Was sure he would die in a cage. ""I said I wasn't stealing the goddamn car. It's a four-speed. How the hell am I supposed to drive a four-speed?""  
  
  ""Oh, I have a feeling you'd manage just fine."" Ray puffed out his cheeks, considered, blew out air. ""Now, choice number two—""  
  
  ""Ray! What are you doing out there with that boy?""  
  
  Ray glanced toward the porch, where a woman with wild red hair and a ratty blue robe stood with her hands on her hips.  
  
  ""Just discussing some life choices. He was stealing your car.""  
  
  ""Well, for heaven's sake!""  
  
  ""Somebody beat the crap out of him. Recently, I'd say.""  
  
  ""Well."" Stella Quinn's sigh could be heard clearly across the dewy green lawn. ""Bring him in and I'll take a look at him. Hell of a way to start the morning. Hell of a way. No, you get inside there, idiot dog. Fine one you are, never one bark when my car's being stolen.""  
  
  ""My wife, Stella."" Ray's smile spread and glowed. ""She just gave you choice number two. Hungry?""  
  
  The voice was buzzing in Cam's head. A dog was barking in high, delighted yips from miles and miles away. Birds sang shrilly and much too close by. His skin went brutally hot, then brutally cold. And he went blind.  
  
  ""Steady there, son. I'll get you.""  
  
  He fell into the oily black and never heard Ray's quiet oath.  
  
  When he woke, he was lying on a firm mattress in a room where the breeze ruffled the sheer curtains and carried in the scent of flowers and water. Humiliation and panic rose up in him. Even as he tried to sit up, hands held him down.  
  
  ""Just lie still a minute.""  
  
  He saw the long, thin face of the woman who leaned over him, poking, prodding. There were thousands of gold freckles over it, which for some reason he found fascinating. Her eyes were dark green and frowning. Her mouth was set in a thin, serious line. She'd scraped back her hair, and she smelled faintly of dusting powder.  
  
  Cam realized abruptly that he'd been stripped down to his tattered Jockeys. The humiliation and panic exploded.  
  
  ""Get the hell away from me."" His voice came out in a croak of terror, infuriating him.  
  
  ""Relax now. Relax. I'm a doctor. Look at me."" Stella leaned her face closer. ""Look at me now. Tell me your name.""  
  
  His heart thundered in his chest. ""John.""  
  
  ""Smith, I imagine,"" she said dryly. ""Well, if you have the presence of mind to lie, you're not doing too badly."" She shined a light in his eyes, grunted. ""I'd say you've got yourself a mild concussion. How many times have you passed out since you were beat up?""  
  
  ""That was the first."" He felt himself coloring under her unblinking stare and struggled not to squirm. ""I think. I'm not sure. I have to go.""  
  
  ""Yes, you do. To the hospital.

No."" Terror gave him the strength to grab her arm before she could rise. If he ended up in the hospital, there would be questions. With questions came cops. With cops came the social workers. And somehow, before it was over, he'd end up back in that trailer that stank of stale beer and piss with a man who found his greatest relief in pounding on a boy half his size.  
  
  ""I'm not going to any hospital. I'm not. Just give me my clothes. I've got some money. I'll pay you for the trouble. I have to go.""  
  
  She sighed again. ""Tell me your name. Your real one.""  
  
  ""Cam. Cameron.""  
  
  ""Cam, who did this to you?""  
  
  ""I don't—""  
  
  ""Don't lie to me,"" she snapped.  
  
  And he couldn't. His fear was too huge, and his head was starting to throb so fiercely he could barely stop the whimper. ""My father.""  
  
  ""Why?""  
  
  ""Because he likes to.""  
  
  Stella pressed her fingers against her eyes, then lowered her hands and looked out of the window. She could see the water, blue as summer, the trees, thick with leaves, and the sky, cloudless and lovely. And in such a fine world, she thought, there were parents who beat their children because they liked to. Because they could. Because they were there.  
  
  ""All right, we'll take this one step at a time. You've been dizzy, experienced blurred vision.""  
  
  Cautious, Cam nodded. ""Maybe some. But I haven't eaten in a while.""  
  
  ""Ray's down taking care of that. Better in the kitchen than me. Your ribs are bruised, but they're not broken. The eye's the worst of it,"" she murmured, touching a gentle finger to the swelling. ""We can treat that here. We'll clean you up and doctor you and see how you do. I am a doctor,"" she told him again, and smiled as her hand, blissfully cool, smoothed his hair back. ""A pediatrician.""  
  
  ""That's a kid doctor.""  
  
  ""You still qualify, tough guy. If I don't like how you do, you're going in for X-rays."" She reached into her bag for antiseptic. ""This is going to sting a little.""  
  
  He winced, sucked in his breath as she began to treat his face. ""Why are you doing this?""  
  
  She couldn't stop herself. With her free hand she brushed back a messy shock of his dark hair. ""Because I like to.""  
  
  they'd kept him. it had been as simple as that, Cam thought now. Or so it had seemed to him at the time. He hadn't realized until years later how much work, effort, and money they'd invested in first fostering, then adopting him. They'd given him their home, their name, and everything worthwhile in his life.  
  
  They'd lost Stella nearly eight years ago to a cancer that had snuck into her body and eaten away at it. Some of the light had gone out of that house on the outskirts of the little water town of St. Christopher's, and out of Ray, out of Cam, and out of the two other lost boys they'd made their own.  
  
  Cam had gone racing—anything, anywhere. Now he was racing home to the only man he'd ever considered his father.  
  
  He'd been to this hospital countless times. When his mother had been on staff, and then when she'd been in treatment for the thing that killed her.  
  
  He walked in now, punchy and panicked, and asked for Raymond Quinn at the admission's desk.  
  
  ""He's in Intensive Care. Family only.""  
  
  ""I'm his son."" Cameron turned away and headed for the elevator. He didn't have to be told what floor. He knew too well.  
  
  He saw Phillip the moment the doors opened onto ICU. ""How bad?""  
  
  Phillip handed over one of the two cups of coffee he held. His face was pale with fatigue, his normally well-groomed tawny hair tousled by his hands. His long, somewhat angelic face was roughened by stubble, and his eyes, a pale golden brown, shadowed with exhaustion.  
  
  ""I wasn't sure you'd make it. It's bad, Cam. Christ, I've got to sit down a minute.""  
  
  He stepped into a small waiting area, and dropped into a chair. The can of Coke in the pocket of his tailored suit clunked. For a moment he stared blindly at the morning show running brightly on the TV screen.  
  
  ""What happened?"" Cam demanded. ""Where is he? What do the doctors say?""  
  
  ""He was heading home from Baltimore. At least Ethan thinks he'd gone to Baltimore. For something. He hit a telephone pole. Dead on."" He pressed the heel of his hand to his heart because it ached every time he pictured it. ""They say maybe he had a heart attack or a stroke and lost control, but they're not sure yet. He was driving fast. Too fast.""  
  
  He had to close his eyes because his stomach kept trying to jump into his throat. ""Too fast,"" he repeated. ""It took them nearly an hour to cut him out of the wreck. Nearly an hour. The paramedics said he was conscious on and off. It was just a couple miles from here.""  
  
  He remembered the Coke in his pocket, opened the can, and drank. He kept trying to block the image out of his head, to concentrate on the now, and the what happened next. ""They got ahold of Ethan pretty quick,"" Phillip continued. ""When he got here Dad was in surgery. He's in a coma now."" He looked up, met his brother's eyes. ""They don't expect him to come out of it.""  
  
  ""That's bullshit. He's strong as an ox.""  
  
  ""They said…"" Phillip closed his eyes again. His head felt empty, and he had to search for every thought. ""Massive trauma. Brain damage. Internal injuries. He's on life support. The surgeon… he… Dad's a registered organ donor.""  
  
  ""Fuck that."" Cam's voice was low and furious.  
  
  ""Do you think I want to consider it?"" Phillip rose now, a tall, rangy man in a wrinkled thousand-dollar suit. ""They said it's a matter of hours at most. The machines are keeping him breathing. Goddamn it, Cam, you know how Mom and Dad talked about this when she got sick. No extreme measures. They made living wills, and we're ignoring his because… because we can't stand not to.""  
  
  ""You want to pull the plug?"" Cam reached out, grabbed Phillip by the lapels. ""You want to pull the goddamn plug on him?""  
  
  Weary and sick at heart, Phillip shook his head. ""I'd rather cut my hand off. I don't want to lose him any more than you do. You'd better see for yourself.""  
  
  He turned, led the way down the corridor, where the scent was hopelessness not quite masked by antiseptics. They moved through double doors, past a nurse's station, past small glass-fronted rooms where machines beeped and hope hung stubbornly on.  
  
  Ethan was sitting in a chair by the bed when they walked in. His big, calloused hand was through the guard and covering Ray's. His tall, wiry body was bent over, as if he'd been talking to the unconscious man in the bed beside him. He stood up slowly and, with eyes bruised from lack of sleep, studied Cam.  
  
  ""So, you decided to put in an appearance. Strike up the band.""  
  
  ""I got here as soon as I could."" He didn't want to admit it, didn't want to believe it. The man, the old, terrifyingly frail man, lying in the narrow bed, was his father. Ray Quinn was huge, strong, invincible. But the man with his father's face was shrunken, pale and still as death.  
  
  ""Dad."" He moved to the side of the bed, leaned down close. ""It's Cam. I'm here."" He waited, somehow sure it would take only that for his father's eyes to open, to wink slyly.  
  
  But there was no movement, and no sound except the monotonous beep of the machines.  
  
  ""I want to talk to his doctor.""  
  
  ""Garcia."" Ethan scrubbed his hands over his face, back into his sun-bleached hair. ""The brain cutter Mom used to call Magic Hands. The nurse'll page him.""  
  
  Cam straightened, and for the first time he noticed the boy curled up asleep in a chair in the corner. ""Who's the kid?""  
  
  ""The latest of Ray Quinn's lost boys."" Ethan managed a small smile. Normally it would have softened his serious face, warmed the patient blue eyes. ""He told you about him. Seth. Dad took him on about three months ago."" He started to say more but caught Phillip's warning look and shrugged. ""We'll get into that later.""  
  
  Phillip stood at the foot of the bed, rocking back and forth on his heels. ""So how was Monte Carlo?"" At Cam's blank stare, he shrugged his shoulder. It was a gesture all three of them used in lieu of words. ""The nurse said that we should talk to him, to each other. That maybe he can… They don't know for sure.""  
  
  ""It was fine."" Cam sat and  
mirrored Ethan by reaching for Ray's hand through the bed guard. Because the hand was limp and lifeless, he held it gently and willed it to squeeze his own. ""I won a bundle in the casinos and had a very hot French model in my suite when your fax came through."" He shifted, spoke directly to Ray. ""You should have seen her. She was incredible. Legs up to her ears, gorgeous man-made breasts.""  
  
  ""Did she have a face?"" Ethan asked dryly.  
  
  ""One that went just fine with the body. I tell you, she was a killer. And when I said I had to leave, she got just a little bitchy."" He tapped his face where the scratches scored his cheek. ""I had to toss her out of the room into the hall before she tore me to ribbons. But I did remember to toss her dress out after her.""  
  
  ""She was naked?"" Phillip wanted to know.  
  
  ""As a jay.""  
  
  Phillip grinned, then had his first laugh in nearly twenty hours. ""God, leave it to you."" He laid his hand over Ray's foot, needing the connection. ""He'll love that story.""  
  
  in the corner, seth pretended to be asleep. He'd heard Cam come in. He knew who he was. Ray had talked about Cameron a lot. He had two thick scrapbooks filled to busting with clippings and articles and photos of his races and exploits.  
  
  He didn't look so tough and important now, Seth decided. The guy looked sick and pale and hollow-eyed. He'd make up his own mind about what he thought of Cameron Quinn.  
  
  He liked Ethan well enough. Though the man'd work your butt raw if you went out oystering or clamming with him. He didn't preach all the time, and he'd never once delivered a blow or a backhand even when Seth had made mistakes. And he fit Seth's ten-year-old view of a sailor pretty well.  
  
  Rugged, tanned, thick curling hair with streaks of blond in the brown, hard muscles, salty talk. Yeah, Seth liked him well enough.  
  
  He didn't mind Phillip. He was usually all pressed and polished. Seth figured the guy must have six million ties, though he couldn't imagine why a man would want even one. But Phillip had some sort of fancy job in a fancy office in Baltimore. Advertising. Coming up with slick ideas to sell things to people who probably didn't need them anyway.  
  
  Seth figured it was a pretty cool way to run a con.  
  
  Now Cam. He was the one who went for the flash, who lived on the edge and took the risks. No, he didn't look so tough, he didn't look like such a badass.  
  
  Then Cam turned his head, and his eyes locked onto Seth's. Held there, unblinking and direct until Seth felt his stomach quiver. To escape, he simply closed his eyes and imagined himself back at the house by the water, throwing sticks for the clumsy puppy Ray called Foolish.  
  
  Knowing the boy was awake and aware of his gaze, Cam continued to study him. Good-looking kid, he decided, with a mop of sandy hair and a body that was just starting to go gangly. If he grew into his feet, he'd be a tall one before he was finished sprouting. He had a kiss-my-ass chin, Cam observed, and a sulky mouth. In the pretense of sleep, he managed to look harmless as a puppy and just about as cute.  
  
  But the eyes… Cam had recognized that edge in them, that animal wariness. He'd seen it often enough in the mirror. He hadn't been able to make out the color, but they'd been dark. Blue or brown, he imagined.  
  
  ""Shouldn't we park the kid somewhere else?""  
  
  Ethan glanced over. ""He's fine here. Nobody to leave him with anyhow. On his own he'd just look for trouble.""  
  
  Cam shrugged, looked away, and forgot him. ""I want to talk to Garcia. They've got to have test results, or something. He drives like a pro, so if he had a heart attack or a stroke…"" His voice trailed off—it was simply too much to contemplate. ""We need to know. Standing around here isn't helping.""  
  
  ""You need to do something,"" Ethan said, his soft voice a sign of suppressed temper, ""you go on and do it. Being here counts."" He stared at his brother across Ray's unconscious form. ""It's always what counted.""  
  
  ""Some of us didn't want to dredge for oysters or spend our lives checking crab pots,"" Cam shot back. ""They gave us a life and expected us to do what we wanted with it.""  
  
  ""So you did what you wanted.""  
  
  ""We all did,"" Phillip put in. ""If something was wrong with Dad the last few months, Ethan, you should have told us.""  
  
  ""How the hell was I supposed to know?"" But he had known something, just hadn't been able to put his finger on it. And had let it slide. That ate at him now as he sat listening to the machines that kept his father breathing.  
  
  ""Because you were there,"" Cam told him.  
  
  ""Yeah, I was there. And you weren't—not for years.""  
  
  ""And if I'd stayed on St. Chris he wouldn't have run into a damn telephone pole? Christ."" Cam dragged his hands through his hair. ""That makes sense.""  
  
  ""If you'd been around. If either of you had, he wouldn't have tried to do so much on his own. Every time I turned around he was up on a damn ladder, or pushing a wheelbarrow, or painting his boat. And he's still teaching three days a week at the college, tutoring, grading papers. He's almost seventy, for Christ's sake.""  
  
  ""He's only sixty-seven."" Phillip felt a hard, ice-edged chill claw through him. ""And he's always been healthy as a team of horses.""  
  
  ""Not lately he hasn't. He's been losing weight and looking tired and worn-out. You saw it for yourself.""  
  
  ""All right, all right."" Phillip scrubbed his hands over his face, felt the scrape of a day's growth of beard. ""So maybe he should have been slowing down a little. Taking on the kid was probably too much, but there wasn't any talking him out of it.""  
  
  ""Always squabbling.""  
  
  The voice, weak and slurred, caused all three men to jolt to attention.  
  
  ""Dad."" Ethan leaned forward first, his heart fluttering in his chest.  
  
  ""I'll get the doctor.""  
  
  ""No. Stay,"" Ray mumbled before Phillip could rush out of the room. It was a hideous effort, this coming back, even for a moment. And Ray understood he had moments only. Already his mind and body seemed separate things, though he could feel the pressure of hands on his hands, hear the sound of his sons' voices, and the fear and anger in them.  
  
  He was tired, oh, God, so tired. And he wanted Stella. But before he left, he had one last duty.  
  
  ""Here."" The lids seemed to weigh several pounds apiece, but he forced his eyes to open, struggled to focus. His sons, he thought, three wonderful gifts of fate. He'd done his best by them, tried to show them how to become men. Now he needed them for one more. Needed them to stay a unit without him and tend the child.  
  
  ""The boy."" Even the words had weight. It made him wince to push them from mind to lips. ""The boy's mine. Yours now. Keep the boy, whatever happens, you see to him. Cam. You'll understand him best."" The big hand, once so strong and vital, tried desperately to squeeze. ""Your word on it.""  
  
  ""We'll take care of him."" At that moment, Cam would have promised to drag down the moon and stars. ""We'll take care of him until you're on your feet again.""  
  
  ""Ethan."" Ray sucked in another breath that wheezed through the respirator. ""He'll need your patience, your heart. You're a fine waterman because of them.""  
  
  ""Don't worry about Seth. We'll look after him.""  
  
  ""Phillip.""  
  
  ""Right here."" He moved closer, bending low. ""We're all right here.""  
  
  ""Such good brains. You'll figure how to make it all work. Don't let the boy go. You're brothers. Remember you're brothers. So proud of you. All of you. Quinns."" He smiled a little, and stopped fighting. ""You have to let me go now.""  
  
  ""I'm getting the doctor."" Panicked, Phillip rushed out of the room while Cam and Ethan tried to will their father back to consciousness.  
  
  No one noticed the boy who stayed curled in the chair, his eyes squeezed tightly shut against hot tears.

  they came alone and in crowds to wake and to bury Ray Quinn. He'd been more than a resident of the dot on the map known as St. Christopher's. He'd been teacher and friend and confidant. In years when the oyster crop was lean, he'd helped organize fund-raisers or had suddenly found dozens of odd jobs that needed to be done to tide the watermen over a hard winter.  
  
\>   If a student was struggling, Ray found a way to carve out an extra hour for a one-on-one. His literature classes at the university had always been filled, and it was rare for one to forget Professor Quinn.  
  
  He'd believed in community, and that belief had been both strong and supple in deed. He had realized that most vital of humanities. He had touched lives.  
  
  And he had raised three boys that no one had wanted into men.
