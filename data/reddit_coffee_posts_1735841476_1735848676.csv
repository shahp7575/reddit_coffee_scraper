1hs31le,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hs31le/does_athome_teeth_whitening_actually_work_my/,Does At-Home Teeth Whitening Actually Work? My Experience and Results,"Teeth whitening is one of those things that always sounds great in theory but feels risky to try. Will it actually work? Is it safe for your enamel? Can you trust an at-home kit to deliver noticeable results? These were all questions I had before diving into an at-home teeth whitening kit. Here’s a detailed look at my experience and what you can expect.

# Why I Decided to Try At-Home Whitening

Professional teeth whitening treatments are expensive and often leave people dealing with sensitivity for days. While they promise dramatic results, the cost (upwards of $500) and time commitment can make them impractical for many.

At-home whitening kits seemed like a more affordable and convenient option, but I was skeptical after hearing mixed reviews online. However, when I found a kit with a **dentist-formulated whitening gel** and an LED mouthpiece, I decided it was worth trying.

# The Whitening Process: Step-by-Step

This particular kit had a simple process that fit easily into my daily routine:

1. **Prepare Your Teeth**: Brush and dry your teeth to ensure the whitening gel sticks effectively.
2. **Apply the Gel**: Use the applicator to evenly coat your teeth with a thin layer of the whitening gel.
3. **Use the LED Mouthpiece**: Insert the mouthpiece, turn it on, and relax for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse and Repeat**: After removing the mouthpiece, rinse your mouth and clean the device for the next session.

The instructions were clear, and the whole process was surprisingly easy to follow.

# Day-by-Day Results

Here’s what I noticed during my six-day whitening journey:

* **Day 1**: No major changes, but my teeth felt cleaner after using the gel.
* **Day 3**: By the third session, there were visible improvements. The stains from coffee and tea were starting to fade, and my teeth looked brighter.
* **Day 6**: By the end of the cycle, my teeth were noticeably whiter—about 6–7 shades brighter. The results were natural and evenly distributed, with no weird patches or overly white spots.

One of the biggest surprises was the **lack of sensitivity**. I’ve tried whitening strips before, and they always left me cringing at cold drinks. With this kit, I had zero discomfort, which was a huge relief.

# What Sets This Kit Apart?

There are countless teeth whitening kits on the market, but this one stood out for a few key reasons:

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: The gel was designed to be both effective and safe for enamel, tackling both surface stains and deeper discoloration.
2. **LED Activation**: The LED mouthpiece helps the gel penetrate deeper into the enamel, speeding up the whitening process and delivering more even results.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients**: The gel is stored in controlled conditions to ensure it remains potent and effective when it arrives at your door.

Check it out** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# How Does It Compare to Other Whitening Methods?

Having tried a variety of whitening options, here’s how this kit measures up:

* **Whitening Strips**: These are easy to use but can leave uneven results and often cause sensitivity.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Great for maintaining a white smile but not powerful enough to tackle deeper stains.
* **Professional Treatments**: Extremely effective but costly and often uncomfortable.

This kit offered a perfect middle ground: affordable, effective, and gentle.

# Common Questions About At-Home Whitening

Here are some common concerns I’ve seen online and what I found during my experience:

1. **Does it damage enamel?** Not with this kit. The gel is formulated to protect your enamel while lifting stains.
2. **Is it effective on deep stains?** Yes, it worked on both surface stains and older discoloration caused by coffee and tea.
3. **How long do results last?** This depends on your habits, but avoiding staining foods and drinks can help extend the results for several months.

# Tips for Success

If you’re planning to try an at-home whitening kit, here are some tips to get the best results:

1. **Be Consistent**: Stick to the recommended daily routine for the full six days. Skipping sessions can lead to uneven results.
2. **Avoid Staining Foods**: Minimize coffee, tea, and wine consumption during the whitening process to prevent new stains.
3. **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene**: Regular brushing and flossing will help keep your teeth bright and stain-free.

# Final Thoughts

At-home teeth whitening kits have come a long way, and this one proved that you don’t need to visit a dentist to get noticeable results. It’s easy to use, gentle on sensitive teeth, and delivers a brighter smile in just six days.

While professional treatments are still the best choice for instant, dramatic whitening, this kit is a fantastic alternative for those looking for a cost-effective, gradual approach.

The drip tray for my coffee machine kinda stinks and I designed a better one. It's basically a 132x113x60mm rectangular prism (with soft corners) and a few precise (measured to nearest 0.5mm) \~60mm cylinder cuts in the middle to fit some metal pieces I have. I can use standard resin for this one unless anyone has suggestions about other materials. I live in Manhattan, happy to pick up from the NYC area, or open to shipping!

Thank you for your support, the follows, and kind words. 

I am wishing you a Happy and Prosperous New Year! I am not going to make a forecast on 2025, but I will say this. My approach is bottom-up, sifting through thousands of stocks which are seeing positive money flows into them on a daily basis. If one industry falls out of favor, there will be another one, and that is where I will put my money hopefully ahead of the crowds and exit before they start selling.

If 2025 ends up being a shoppy sideways or a slightly down year, it will be great for selling options and making regular income, so stay tuned for an upcoming post on how I trade options and the realted mechanics.

Here is a quick note on my current holdings:

BIOA - I am in the money on this one, and I plan on holding it.

BOLT - Same as above.

NOVA, WOLF and IBRX - I still own the original positions but unfortunately I was heavier on IBRX than the other two, so in this set of heavily shorted stocks I am near break even overall. NOVA is a great winner with some more room to run, in my opinion.

I am testing a quantitative model which uses the logic and implications of the post I wrote on pennystocks, and as a result, I picked these stocks today from the model, albeit after some quick manual review. My goal is to quantify as much as possible of the analytics, so I am taking this slowly.

One of the stocks in it was $ZOM, and the other 3 are available on my kofi for my reddit supporters who are enjoying my DD and trades before the are posted publicly. For my reddit followers I have a 90% of the Premium tier offer, so for only $10 coffee/beer/tip a month you can also get those alerts in near real time. Here is the link with today's trades: [https://ko-fi.com/post/Todays-trades-and-notes-4-new-picks-U7U718DB1I](https://ko-fi.com/post/Todays-trades-and-notes-4-new-picks-U7U718DB1I)

Hope you are having a good week, even after the tax loss harvesting mania. I did not expect people would sell so much before the end of the year, else I would have posted an options trade on SPY as I usually do on r/options and r/algotrading.

Thanks for your support, and always keep your trades small, take quick profits or losses, and be careful when trading penny stocks.

Welcome to 2025 and the first Weekly Recap of the year! Let's see how we rounded out 2024!

**NEWS AND ISSUES**

* Reddit was having an issue loading comments just a little while ago today. It should be fixed at this time, but it may take a little while before all comments have caught up. We posted about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1hs1wsw/all_platforms_were_investigating_reports_around/) in r/bugs and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hs1ye8/all_platforms_were_investigating_reports_around/) in r/help.

* There is an experiment that is currently running some tests on in-app swiping gestures for iOS, including the comment collapse swipe. I responded to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1he3e4r/swipe_to_collapse_in_ios_app/) with this information. 

* Some users are experiencing an issue with iOS where the buttons become unresponsive. Our friend u/Goldennuggets-3000 made a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hhwslu/unresponsive_navigation_on_ios_app/) in r/help and I crossposted over in r/bugs. A fix is in the works! 

* Some users are unable to load chat. The chat team reached out to me about this and let me know the situation and I made posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hhbe6q/chat_is_failing_to_load_for_some_users/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1hhbcjd/chat_is_failing_to_load_for_some_users/) to let you know the situation. The workaround is to use mobile data instead of wifi. This, apparently, does not work for everyone, so unfortunately, it's not a guaranteed fix. I'm sorry about that! 

* The sort option on the desktop site is not being respected. It is likely that this feature will be removed to avoid confusion and frustration while a solution is worked on. When that happens, the sort will default to hot, though you will be able to change it. 

* No update to the apps this week. It looks like the next updates will be January 13 (if I'm reading the schedule correctly). 

**ONGOING ISSUES**

* If your account gets the ""server error"" banner or you can't update your profile, I can fix that sometimes! Just let me know and I'll take a look and get you all taken care of! Please note that I cannot give any information or assist with any account unless contacted directly from that account. 

* If no one else can see your posts or comments across Reddit (not just in one sub) and you are unable to post here in r/help, you can file an appeal [here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000600232). 

* Please check the [Help Center](https://www.reddithelp.com/) to see if you can find the answer to your question there. Also, check this sub for stickied posts regarding outages and downtime. 

* If your account is marked as NSFW and it is not NSFW, you can check out [this Help Center article](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043471131-Why-was-my-profile-marked-as-Not-Safe-for-Work-NSFW-and-how-can-I-change-it) for information on how to change it back. If you're unable to change it back, feel free to make a post and we'll help you out. (Team effort, this one is! Thanks to all of the helpers who flag me for this.) 

**IMPORTANT REMINDER ABOUT 2FA** 🚨

2FA adds an extra layer of security to your Reddit account. You can learn more about 2fa in [this Help Center article](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043470031-What-is-two-factor-authentication-and-how-do-I-set-it-up). 

**Once 2FA is enabled, Reddit can’t help you regain access if you lose your authenticator app or backup codes. Keep them safe!**

So if you're switching phones, plan ahead! 

Got a new phone over the holidays? Don’t forget to disable 2FA on your old device first and re-enable it on your new one. Skipping this step could lock you out of your account.

Best Practices for Keeping Your Account Safe 

**1. Save Your Backup Codes Securely**

When setting up 2FA, you’ll receive backup codes. Store them in a secure location (not on your phone). You can access codes anytime in your account settings as long as you're in your account.

**2. Use a Cloud Backup App**

If you’re not sure which authenticator app to use, we’d suggest [2FAS](https://2fas.com/) or Google Authenticator for standalone apps. Or you can use password managers with built-in 2fa management like[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) or [1Password](https://1password.com/). 

**3. Use Single Sign-On (SSO)**

Connecting your Reddit account to Google or Apple SSO provides additional login options which can help you regain access if your 2FA fails.

**Pro Tip:** Take 5 minutes now to review your 2FA setup. A little preparation today can save you from a lot of frustration and heartbreak tomorrow. 

**WEEKLY STATISTICS**

Over the past 7 days, r/help had 1,574 posts, which is 83 more posts and a 5.5% increase from the 1,491 posts in the previous 7 days. And there were 4,159 comments which is up/down 58 comments for a 1.4% increase from the 4,217 comments the previous seven days. 1,900 new users subscribed to r/help last week and there were over 1.2 million views, which is about the same as the 1.2 million views last week. 

I'm working on some yearly stats for r/help in 2024! Look for those in a future Weekly Recap or it's own standalone post! 

**TOP POSTS**

* **[Why do people just downvote posts or comments that are genuinely asking for help](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hq57wr/why_do_people_just_downvote_posts_or_comments/)**

Sometimes, things get downvoted. It happens. It's not fun, but we've all been there. And not all downvotes are unwarranted, so that's one thing to consider. If you are getting downvoted for ""asking a question"", consider if you're asking in the correct subreddit, or if that information is on the sidebar or has been asked before and can be found by searching. Regardless, the good news is that if you continue to post quality content, the upvotes will outweigh the downvotes and you'll see your karma start to climb! 

* **[I can't un-NSFW my account](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1horwbu/i_cant_unnsfw_my_account/)**

A user was having trouble removing the NSFW tag from their SFW account. This is the issue that I mention pretty much every week in these recaps. If your account is not NSFW, you can go into your Settings and change that. If it doesn't change, you can create a post and one of the helpful helpers will, wait for it, help! 

This particular post generated a bit of discussion about things that a user could have done to trigger that tag. As u/jgoja pointed out ""You can subscribe to as many nsfw subreddits as you want without it affecting your account. You just can’t post or comment on anything nsfw."" Also, if you're the mod of an NSFW subreddit, your account will likely be marked as NSFW. 

* **[I often have to switch to old reddit to make post and comments because they will disappear or throw an error on the default set up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hp2l4k/i_often_have_to_switch_to_old_reddit_to_make_post/)**

This was upvoted a lot, but there weren't a lot of comments and OP did not follow up with the suggestion that was provided, so it's hard to know what's going on here. I haven't seen this issue repeatedly come up, so I don't know if it's widespread at this time or what troubleshooting measures may have been able to help this user.

Please help! I know I’m so dumb for being the cause of my problem in the first place. We have a brand new higher end coffee table and today my daughter had a black washable marker that she smudged on the coffee table. She’s 2.5years old so it was an accident. It was not a big area by any means, but I smudged it more by using the dry eraser end of the marker to “erase it off”.  It removed most of it but kind of spread it out a little bit more in smudge form even though it was much lighter at that point. I should’ve left it as is because to anyone else, it wouldn’t have been noticeable but I personally couldn’t unsee it. My biggest mistake to continue fixing it was then to get on Google to see how to clean a black marker smudge off a wood table. One of the options was nail polish remover and like an idiot, I applied some nail polish remover to the small area without even thinking about it. Huge mistake. It clearly made the entire thing worse and removed the wood/stain. I am at a loss of what to do and just devastated because this is a brand new table. I think the area is too big to be hidden by a wooden marker touch up. Do I need to just find a wood stainer that is a close enough match to apply to the flawed area? Or am I just completely screwed at this point?. Please help if there’s any suggestions you have! Pictures posted for reference ",1,1735848145.0,finishing,0,1.0,False

To make these keto snickerdoodle cookies, all you need to do is mix up your ingredients, roll the cookies into balls and dip in the cinnamon and sweetener mixture, then flatten slightly and bake for 15 minutes.

I tried freezing these low carb snickerdoodles to see how they would hold up and they were just as good if not better than before I'd frozen them. They keep perfectly at room temperature in a sealed container for up to four days (that's how long ours  inside texture of the cookies got a little chewier every day, while the outside stayed toasty and crisp - it was awesome! I implore you to make these keto snickerdoodle cookies ASAP, and then report back as to what you thought of them! I have a feeling that once you try them, you'll be making them over and over again like I have!

Is there something I may have missed?

2. I've been doing light research and heard a 2:1 ratio is ideal for most shots, is this right either?? If I'm putting in 14g dry ground, 28g out is like half a shot of espresso and takes like 3 seconds (vs recommended 24-28) to fill up half an espresso shot cup.

Sweetheart, you’re basically a human game of “Don’t Touch the Lava,” except the lava is *everything*, and you’re face-planting directly into it. I bet your furniture lives in constant fear, bracing for impact every time you stumble into the room like a drunk baby giraffe. Your coffee table probably has a dent shaped like your shin, and your doorframes are *traumatized*. Honestly, you’re the only person I know who could lose a fight with a stationary object—and that’s *before* you’ve even had your morning coffee.

But let’s be real, your coordination isn’t just physical—it’s mental too. Your brain must be like one of those old Windows 95 computers: constantly buffering, freezing, and occasionally shutting down for “updates” that never actually improve anything. I bet you’ve walked into a room, forgotten why you were there, and then walked out only to remember halfway down the hall—only to trip over your own feet on the way back. Your inner monologue must sound like a chaotic bingo hall where all the numbers are called at once. Honestly, how do you even survive? Is there a guardian angel following you around, facepalming every time you try to exist?

And let’s talk about your social game. You’re the kind of person who tries to fist-bump someone and accidentally punches them in the shoulder. Or you go for a handshake, miss entirely, and somehow end up holding their elbow. I bet you’ve apologized to a mannequin at least once in your life. You’re probably the reason self-checkout machines have a “Help” button. If awkwardness were a sport, you’d not only win gold, but you’d trip over the podium, knock the medals into the crowd, and somehow set the Olympic flame on fire *again*.

You’re like a walking sitcom episode that never ends. Every step you take is a cliffhanger, every sentence you start is a plot twist, and every object in your vicinity is a stunt double waiting to get destroyed. Honestly, it’s impressive how someone can be both the main character *and* the comic relief in their own life story.

So, Reddit, let’s give a round of applause to this beautiful disaster. They may be a clumsy, chaotic mess, but at least they’re *our* clumsy, chaotic mess. Now go out there and try not to trip over anything, you magnificent wreck. 😏",2,1735847593.0,ChatGPT,3,1.0,False

First, we can't thank you all enough for an amazing close to 2024. This is a small shop, and it's an uphill battle selling comics in VT already. The support you all have given us has been staggering and we are so so so grateful to have all of you as a part of this.  
  
Now the fun bit, the cafe owners have abruptly vacated the shop and will not be returning. Given what we have learned in the past few days, this is a very good thing for the business.  
  
Well... we now own the cafe outright and can start running it the way it always should have been!  
  
We are already sorting out donuts, coffee, and working with a phenomenal chef with the aim to get breakfast and lunch rolling.  
  
The coffee side is already back up and running, but please be patient as we sort out a new relationship. We are working with a VT based roaster, and are very excited to get that all sorted.

I’ve been to the little 5:17 cafe in Drayton a few times- the staff are nice, good prices and coffee etc, but when I look a little deeper I’m sus. 


The shop is run by ‘Teen Challenge’ which is an international Christian organisation which runs rehab facilities to help people get over addictions (not just drugs, porn and other things). Seems like these lads live on the compound at Drayton Manor and have  very little contact with the outside world whilst part of ‘The Program’… no phones… no TV… working in the cafe- for free as far as I can tell. The Program itself seems fairly secretive - the Wikipedia article about Teen Challenge org says it was created in the 1960’s in the USA and little is known about what happens in the ‘facilities’. There’s also a fair few posts on r/troubledteens about their experiences with Teen Challenge. 

The guys themselves seem friendly and nice enough. There’s around 30 or so of them in Drayton but I think you have to be fairly advanced in the program to work in the cafe.

The cafe is also linked with bread source and blue bear coffee (coffee and justice) - seems to be Christian wheels within wheels.

Earn Your Screen Time!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/achieve-earn-your-screen-time/id6466824356) It’s been a wild ride, and while it may not sound like much, this first milestone feels nice.

So what’s *Achieve!* about? Imagine your phone telling you, “Nope, you haven’t done anything productive, so you don’t get to check Instagram.” Harsh, but fair, right? It’s an iOS app I built that *literally blocks distractions* on your phone until you *earn* screen time by crushing your goals. Yeah, that’s right – you want to scroll? Better check off a goal first. 💪

A few months ago, I thought, “What if my phone were like a strict parent?” And here we are. The app is pretty simple: you set goals, achieve them, and voilà – you unlock your screen time. No goals? No social media binge for you, my friend. Tough love, but it works. 😊

Here’s the full story of how I went from giving the app away for free to actually making a little cash.

# Phase 1: The Free-for-All Experiment 🆓

I started out by offering the app completely free. My genius plan? Get as many users as possible, rake in that sweet feedback, and improve the app. Spoiler alert: the feedback part didn’t exactly go as planned. I tried emailing people… and mostly heard crickets. Turns out, asking strangers to tell you why your app sucks is a harder sell than I expected.

**Lesson learned:** real-world conversations > email black holes. I actually did way better feedback-wise when I guilt-tripped friends and random acquaintances into trying the app on the spot. Talking face-to-face, I finally got the insights I needed to make *Achieve!* something useful.

# Phase 2: The Paid Plan that No One Paid For 😅

Once I got the app to a place where it was genuinely solving a need (for both myself and a handful of others who got hooked on it), I decided to introduce a paid subscription plan to unlock more features. My inner genius thought, “People love choices, right? So let’s give them a whole buffet of customizable settings!”

Reality check: people don’t love choices. At least not a million of them in an app that’s supposed to be simple. The more I added, the more confused people got. And user retention? Hoo boy, it was rough. Nobody was subscribing to the premium plan, and I was starting to wonder if I’d gone overboard.

# Phase 3: Taking It All Away (and Weirdly, Making Money) 🤯

Here’s where things got a little counterintuitive. I decided to rip out most of the customization options and offer just a dead-simple, bare minimum experience that anyone could pick up and use instantly. I gated almost every other feature behind the premium membership, making the free version stupidly simple – like “press this one button and don’t overthink it” simple.

And wouldn’t you know it? Almost immediately, retention went up, and so did my subscription sign-ups. It’s like I had to “un-fancy” the app to make people want to stick around – go figure! After a few days, I saw my first dollars roll in, and eventually, I hit $69. Not life-changing money, but definitely a motivational boost!

# Next Steps: Marketing Magic 🎩✨

Now that I know people are willing to pay for *Achieve!* (and that they really, really don’t want a million options to set up), I’m starting to look into marketing on different channels. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll be rolling in enough cash to buy… another coffee. ☕

So here’s to that first $69. I know it’s not much, but it’s proof that people out there are actually willing to pay to let my app guilt-trip them into being productive. And honestly? That’s priceless.",1,1735846712.0,indiehackers,1,1.0,False

Since becoming a mom a few years back, my annual birthday gift is a one-night stay somewhere by myself. I usually go to Chicago because it's familiar, I love the vibe of the surrounding neighborhoods, and the public transit rocks. 

This year I'm thinking of going somewhere different but still in the midwest, so Milwaukee came to mind. I've never visited. This would be in early spring. Here's my criteria for a successful trip: 

* Decent thrift/vintage/antique shops
* Museums, ideally with historic exhibits (I understand you have a great local museum)
* A neighborhood or street with small businesses to do some shopping
* Lodging in a safe area (32F, I don't make stupid choices when traveling solo, but would rather not stay in a dodgy spot)
* Good coffee/fun restaurants
* Not a big drinker

Based on the trip I'm seeking, would Milwaukee be a good fit? And if so, I'd appreciate any suggestions on the above points! And if your sweet city isn't the best fit, any other midwestern recommendations would be great.",0,1735846688.0,milwaukee,0,0.33,False

I love coffee so had dived in recently into specialty coffee and enjoying tools, workflow, of course coffee.

I am based in UK. I am using Sage Bambino plus and Niche Duo as my daily workhorse for brewing coffee. I have been trying to so far some speciality coffees from Rave, Origins, and Union coffee. I prefer medium roasts coffee and milk based.

Enough of the background build up, so I am going straight to the question and need your honest opinion. whatever coffee beans I have used so far, I was checking taste notes and was expecting the same or close to while tasting final output. I don’t get those fruity flavours or other specific notes mentioned on the packet but just nice coffee smell. My question is - am I not blessed with great nose or taste buds to differentiate those notes mentioned on the coffee packet or I am having some process issues?

I use different grinding numbers for each coffee bean based on standard formula , 18g, 1:2 ratio, 25-30 sec for a yield of 36g.

Three years ago, he went onto the Iced Coffee Hour podcast as a guest—it went viral. Alex was clearly something the viewership found instantly interesting. Charming, well-spoken, and inhumanly jacked. You wouldn't expect someone who looks like him to have a well-developed psyche, but he did. At some point the conversation switched from genius entrepreneur reveals his secrets to extreme existential theory—and it remained the topic for the final 25 minutes of the video. 

Alex spent the majority of the podcast sharing stories and anecdotes on how he became successful, but towards the end, he started \*demonstrating\* how he rewires his actual nervous system for success.   
  
""When you admit that you just want to be happy, then what happens is you create a deficit between your current reality and happiness""

""A desire is a contract we make with ourselves to be unhappy until we get what we want""

""Everyone is unhappy because they say they want to be happy—rather than just saying f\*ck happiness""

""How we say things is how we think things""

""Most people, in my opinion, that I have witnessed, who are unhappy are weighed down by the chains of their parents, their friends, their siblings—of people who they believe are casting judgement onto them—and they care so much about that person's disapproval that they don't do the things they want to do.""

""My instant self-help whenever something bad happens is—I'm gonna die and it's not gonna matter""

Alex's perspective on happiness and desire resonated with me deeply, but I'm curious to hear how others interpret it. Do you think happiness is about breaking free from societal expectations, as Alex suggests? Or is there more to it? How have you rewired your mindset or approached similar struggles in your own life? I'd love to hear your thoughts!

Been working for small construction company for a couple of months. First job in this field and went in with no prior knowledge. Already checked my states DoL and ADA resources but would like some further insight.  
First time navigating a situation like this so please excuse any ignorance.

TL;DR:

**OT / Wages**

* Recently went through my pay stubs and time sheets and noticed hours worked and OT that were not paid out. Was given cash a few times with no further explanation as to what it was for.
* Required to show up 15 minutes before start of shift, often required to perform minor maintenance on vans during this time as boss avoids all OT. Not sure if this counts as work.
* Recent memo states that if boss expects a certain tool to be in van and is not, employee went who to look for part is responsible for replacing it.
* Employees that need to leave early have to use their own vehicle if they need to leave early, will not be compensated for gas or tolls.

**Harassment**

* Have been subjected to sexual harassment, bullying, threats of violence, sexism, and a hostile work environment. Boss has taken no action to remedy issue.
* Have been sexually harassed, bullied, threatened with bodily harm, and humiliated by a single coworker numerous times. Boss has taken no actions to mitigate issue.
* Recently diagnosed with ADHD, boss knows, and am hesitant to ask for reasonable accommodation because of ‘lol snowflake’ attitude.
* Have extensive documentation for everything. Planning on emailing boss when I get a little more insight.
* Panning on leaving ASAP, not going to give notice.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**OT / Wages**

* I recently went through all of my pay stubs and time sheets and noticed hours worked and OT that were not paid out. When I first started I was given an envelope of cash a few times with no further explanation. I do not have any documentation of receiving this money and am not sure if the company has kept any records of it.
* The employee handbook states that employees should show up 15 minutes before their scheduled work time to prep tools and, since the boss avoids OT at all costs, check the vans for any minor maintenance that should be needed, such as adding oil (that is not provided to us), getting gas, etc. I am not sure if this counts as ‘working’.
* A memo was recently sent out that if any tool that the boss expects to be on the van is not, the employee responsible looking for the tool is expected to replace it, regardless if they were the last one to use or not.
* If an employee has to leave by a certain time (Dr.’s appt, etc.) they must use their own vehicle and will not be compensated for tolls or gas.

**Harassment**

* I have been subjected to sexual harassment, bullying, threats of violence, and a hostile work environment since day one. One employee is responsible for 95% of this behavior. He has humiliated me in front of coworkers more than once with name calling, sexist comments, and threats of bodily harm. This behavior is starting to become prevalent in my boss. I’ve informed my boss **numerous times** of how uncomfortable I am working with this employee, but no disciplinary actions have been taken. He did sit down with me one time and asked if I wanted to leave the company, but I (stupidly) decided to stay as he had previously told me I’d be the “coffee bitch” in any another other shop.
* I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, which I’ve mentioned to my boss several times. I have asked him to speak slower, ask for clarification, reading back what I was told, etc. and is visibly irritated/angry that ‘I am not listening to him’. I am hesitant to officially ask for reasonable accommodations because he is a ‘Don’t bother me with your bullshit’/‘No ExCuSeS’ kind of guy.  I am aware that I can still be fired for lack of performance, etc.

I'd be hungry, I hadn't eaten anything or had a decent meal, but nothing sounds good or appetizing or like it's worth making.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Using beige in your home is a fantastic way to create a warm ambiance. This versatile color can serve as a neutral background that complements various styles, allowing you to design a cozy and inviting space. Here are some creative ways to incorporate beige into your home for that warm, welcoming feel.

### Layer Your Textiles

One of the simplest ways to use beige to create warmth is through textiles. Consider layering different beige fabrics to add texture and depth to your space. Here are some ideas:

- **Throws and Blankets:** Drape a rich, beige throw over your sofa or chair for added comfort.
- **Cushions:** Mix and match beige cushions with various patterns and textures to make your seating arrangements more inviting.
- **Rugs:** A plush beige area rug can anchor a room, making it feel cozier.

### Accent Walls with Beige Tones

Painting an accent wall in a warm beige tone is an excellent way to infuse warmth into a room. You can choose a deeper beige for a dramatic effect or a soft, pale beige for a subtle transition. Here are some suggestions:

- **Living Room:** Use a rich beige to highlight a fireplace or create a focal point behind a piece of art.
- **Bedroom:** A gentle beige can set a relaxing tone for your bedroom, promoting a restful atmosphere.
- **Dining Room:** Richer beige hues can enhance a welcoming dining experience, making guests feel at home.

### Add Beige Furniture Pieces

Integrating beige furniture into your home can significantly affect the overall warmth of the space. Here are some furniture options that can radiate coziness:

- **Sofas and Chairs:** A beige upholstered sofa can serve as the centerpiece of your living area, inviting family and friends to gather.
- **Coffee Tables:** A wooden coffee table in a soft beige finish adds warmth and character to your living room.
- **Bed Frames:** A beige bed frame or headboard can create a serene and stylish master suite.

### Incorporate Natural Elements

Using beige alongside natural elements can amplify the warmth of your home. Connect with nature by adding these items:

- **Wood Accents:** Light beige wood furniture or decor can bring in an organic feel that complements your warm palette.
- **Plants:** Green plants juxtaposed with beige offer a refreshing contrast, making your spaces feel alive.
- **Natural Fabrics:** Consider linen or cotton in beige hues that add comfort and tactile appeal throughout your home.

### Artwork and Accessories

Incorporate beige through art and decorative pieces. Here are some ways to achieve this:

- **Framed Art:** Choose artwork with beige tones to create a cohesive look and evoke a sense of calm.
- **Decorative Pillows:** Use beige pillows with texture or prints on your sofa or bed to create layers without overwhelming colors.
- **Wall Decor:** Beige wall hangings or sculptures can serve as stunning accents that enhance warmth and sophistication.

### Lighting Choices

Lighting plays a critical role in setting the ambiance. Using beige shades in your lighting can further enhance warmth in your home:

- **Lampshades:** Consider using beige fabric lampshades to diffuse light softly across your space.
- **Light Bulbs:** Opt for warm-toned light bulbs that mimic the gentle glow of natural sunlight, enhancing the beige hues in your decor.

By creatively integrating beige into your home, you can foster a warm, inviting ambiance that feels cozy and comfortable. Remember to mix different textures, tones, and elements to create a harmonious space where you’ll love to relax and entertain.

The Psychological Effects of Beige in Interior Design
-----------------------------------------------------

Beige is often seen as a neutral color, but its role in interior design goes far beyond mere background support. When strategically used, beige can create a warm and inviting atmosphere in your living space. The psychological effects of beige are profound, influencing how you feel when you enter a room. Discover how beige interacts with our senses and emotions, making it a compelling choice for enhancing your home.

### The Comforting Qualities of Beige

Beige is linked to feelings of warmth, comfort, and relaxation. Unlike stark whites or overly bright colors, this soft hue doesn’t demand attention. Instead, it invites you in, making you feel at ease. This subtlety can help to lower stress levels, which is particularly beneficial in areas where you seek calm—like a bedroom or reading nook.

### Creating a Warm Atmosphere with Beige

In interior design, creating a warm ambiance is crucial for making spaces feel inviting. Beige works wonderfully with various accessories and materials:

- **Textures:** different textures, like wool throws or linen cushions, can enhance the warmth of beige without overwhelming the senses.
- **Lighting:** Soft lighting, such as table lamps with warm bulbs, complements beige beautifully. It casts a gentle glow that enhances the color's soothing qualities.
- **Natural Elements:** Pairing beige with wooden furniture or plants can create an organic feel, reinforcing the warm and inviting nature of your space.

### The Versatility of Beige

One of the most appealing aspects of beige is its versatility. It harmonizes with a range of colors and styles. Here are a few examples:

- **Classic Elegance:** Beige blends well with whites and soft pastels, creating an understated but elegant atmosphere.
- **Modern Aesthetic:** When paired with bold colors like navy blue or emerald green, beige can balance the visual weight, creating a modern yet cozy feel.
- **Earthy Vibes:** Combining beige with browns and greens evokes a natural, earth-toned palette that enhances the feeling of tranquility.

### Why Beige Boosts Mental Wellness

Colors can have varying effects on our mental health. Beige promotes relaxation and comfort, leading to enhanced mental wellness. Here’s how:

- **Reduction of Anxiety:** The neutrality of beige provides a sense of safety and calm that can be particularly soothing for people dealing with anxiety. It creates an environment where the mind can rest.
- **Increased Focus:** In workspaces or study areas, beige can help maintain concentration without being distracting. Its soft tone reduces visual noise, enabling better focus.
- **Encouragement of Social Interaction:** Because of its warm nature, beige can create a welcoming environment that encourages conversation and interaction, making it perfect for living rooms and dining areas.

- **Balance:** Use beige as a primary color but balance it with darker or brighter accents to avoid a washed-out look.

- **Personal Touch:** Add personal elements, such as art or photos, that pop against the beige backdrop to create focal points.

Beige is more than just a color; it is an emotion and an experience. Its ability to foster warmth, comfort, and tranquility makes it an excellent choice for various interior spaces.

By thoughtfully selecting how and where to use beige, you’ll create spaces that not only look beautiful but also feel inviting and peaceful. Embrace this timeless hue, and let it work its magic to enrich your home’s ambiance. With the right touches and combinations, beige can indeed help craft an environment where you and your loved ones feel at ease and connected.

Spite Vanilla Frost: This was decent.  I'm not much for Sprite to begin with but I wouldn't mind this flavor sticking around.  If they're going to bottle Coke Freestyle flavors I'd prefer the Barq's Root Beer + Vanilla and the Cream Soda Coke.  

Frostie Blue Cream Soda: This was okay, I guess.  A bit simplistic and oversweetened.  Not great.

Fanta Haunted Apple: The Beetlejuice Beetlejuice tie-in.  REVOLTING.  One of the worst sodas ever, tasting like burnt brown sugar more than anything else.  Could somebody time travel back to 1988 and get me a case of Apple Slice?  Hell Fanta themselves had a Green Apple flavor that was great.

Mountain Dew Purple Thunder: Generic and disappointing fruit flavor.  Tastes like several others they already did.  ""Plum"" my rosey red ass.

Mountain Dew Freedom Fusion: Generic.

Mountain Dew Liberty Chill: Don't even remember what this tasted like.  You know what Dew I liked?  Fruit Quake.  Everyone else hated it.

Mountain Dew Star Spangled Splash:  This red berry Dew was one of the few recent flavors they've tried that I liked.  At this point I think banana is the only fruit Dew hasn't tried yet.  Get it over with!

Mountain Dew Baja Laguna Lemonade: Disappointing.  Not very lemonade-y.

Mountain Dew Point Break Punch: Disappointing. Prefer the movie of the same name.

Sprite Cherry Pineapple Punch (Coke Freestyle machine flavor): Bearable, but with Sprite I'm sticking to vanilla.  Won't really miss this when it's gone.  

**CHIPOTLE:**

Chicken Al Pastor: Very good, though the king of Chipotle limited-edition meats remains Carne Asada.  I only had this in tacos, not quesadillas.

Smoked Brisket: Had this in tacos and quesadillas.  It was pretty good in both, but Chipotle needs to take a cue from Qdoba and try Birria, which is the ultimate taco meat.

**TACO BELL:**

Cheesy Street Chalupas: Pretty good, though I had them take the onions out of mine.  Wish these had stayed around longer.

Cantina Chicken Tacos/Quesadillas: I prefer Doritos Locos as the best Taco Bell tacos but in general these were very good, I'd keep them around like the Nacho Fries, though to be fair if Taco Bell permanently did away with Nacho Fries I'd never eat there ever again.

**TACO JOHN'S:** 

Quesadillas: Had steak and ground beef, they were okay, the Potato Oles seem to be the only great thing about Taco John's.  The fried chicken as a quesadilla/taco meat didn't really work either.  These guys seem to be a lesser Qdoba.

**QDOBA:**

Habanero Lime Steak: Too spicy for me.  Had it in tacos.

Cheese-Crusted Quesadillas: Good but I cannot tell the difference between this and their normal quesadillas.  Didn't really taste the ""cheese crust.""  Qdobas makes good quesadillas though, they're one of the few places that have birria.

**ABELARDO'S:**

Tacos: Bearable, but too similar to taco truck tacos.  Quesadillas: Way too flour-y and dusty.  And drippy.  Rolled tacos: A JOKE.  These damn things are diamond-hard and I swear to God they're just heating up rolled tacos from Wal-Mart.  Quesabirrias: Okay, they had to do one thing right out of the four that I tried, but quesabirrias aren't hard to get right.  This place is basically a taco truck in a restaurant building.  Will probably not be coming back.

**TACO LOCO:**

These guys actually ARE a taco truck and the best one around here that I know of.  Just for hard shell tacos though, they had all sorts of meat choices like a good taco truck would, including the almighty birria.  Good to have now and then.  

**BASKIN-ROBBINS:**

Egg Nog: Had this before, I think?  If it was new for this year, it's one of their better flavors.

Beach Day: They brought it back, and in pint form too, to take home.  Great flavor, the graham cracker swirl is glorious.

Marigold Dreamsicle: Only had this once, but would kill to bring this flavor back.  Who knew flowers could make nice ice cream?

Monkey Business: I never got to try this banana flavor, they yanked it after like two weeks.  DAMMIT!  I love Chunky Monkey B&J, so I should've loved this.  

Winter White Chocolate: Pretty good!

Brie My Guest: Another near-five-star flavor, BR working \*cheese\* into their flavor, to evoke cheeseboards.  I like, I like!  Too bad it was gone after a month.  Just like Summertime Lime, Ube Coconut Swirl, etc...

**LITTLE CAESAR'S:** 

Crazy Puffs: You can have 'em.  I mean, not bad to have once, but once was enough!

**PIZZA HUT:** 

Deep-Dish: I had this in Meat Lovers and Pepperoni.  You have to eat it in store, though they let me take the first one home in a box.  Not great but not bad either.  With the tomato sauce all gooed up on top it's like those store brand deep dishes that I could never cook right.  

Bacon Cheddar Cheese Sticks: Really good, though not all that different tasting from their usual cheese sticks.  Good to have every now and then.  I liked stuff like the P'Zone and Stuffed Cheez-It and Toasted Asiago crust, though, so don't listen to me.

**DOMINO'S:**

Pepperoni Stuffed Cheesy Bread: Too greasy for me.  Will probably not have again.

New York style pizza: I would have liked somewhat better sauce in this, I had it three times, double sausage, bacon cheeseburger and pepperoni & sausage.  Probably not bad to have maybe once a year, assuming they keep it.  Will be associated with the movie *Risky Business* which I finally watched for the first time.  Good film!

**PAPA JOHN'S:**

XLNY Pizza: eaten over the course of about three days.  Uh...pass on having this again. I think I had sausage & meatballs (wish Pizza Hut had kept meatballs as a topping.)  I did not try the Shaq A Roni, that'd probably be the same thing.

Calzone Stuffed Crust: Not that much different than having plain ol mozzarella as the stuffed crust.  I love pizza calzones but after this it's looking like I vastly prefer Papa John's for their Papadias than the pizza.

Cuppy Pepperoni: Had this on pizza AND as ""papa bites.""  It was better with the bites somehow.  I do like the cuppy pepperoni idea as a gimmick, I buy Hormel cuppy pepperoni and put it on frozen four cheese pizzas all the time.

**ARBY'S:** 

Loaded Chicken Bacon Ranch Fries: Passable.  I'm not wild about Arby's in general.  Had to try these once.  A bit overloaded.

Bacon Beef & Cheddar sandwich: Ditto.  Decent to have once.  I'm not an Arby's guy, I went there last time because of the Andes Candies shake.

**IHOP:**

Wonka pancakes: Visually appealing with that royal purple syrup but not that different tasting than their usual pancakes.

Wonka taco: I forget what the actual name of this was.  Okay, but very sugary.  Guessing Timothee Chalamet didn't load up on these.

Wonka hot chocolate: had strawberry in it, whatever it was called.  Decent.

Anytime tacos: I really loved these, one of my favorite new things to try in 2024.  Would probably weigh 500 pounds if I had them every week but was willing to pay the extra $$.  Had shredded beef, bacon and chicken & egg, all good.  Will have them probably once every two months or so from now on.  In recent years I'd kind of taken to eating at iHOP only once a year after being in love with them as a kid.  

""Long Lost"" Cookie Butter Shake: Cookie butter anything is pretty good, IMO.  Really liked this, especially with the tacos.  Hope it stays, though it probably won't (it's some kind of Indiana Jones tie in.)

**POPEYE'S:** 

Apple cranberry tea: Not that impressed with this.  They had several other new drinks in the fall and this is all I tried.  Popeye's is great though.

**SONIC:**

""Dirty"" drinks: Had Coke, Dr. Pepper & Barq's root beer ""dirty.""  This was okay but will probably not try it again unless someone threatens me to.

Groovy Fries: yeah, big whoop, they're fries but really crinkly.  Big deal!

Smashburger: Not that impressed with this.  Smasher sauce doesn't change the flavor of a burger much for me.

Cheesy Bacon Stacker: Pretty good but again, having toast for burger patties doesn't make that much of a difference.  I like their regular bacon cheeseburgers fine, even though they already seem kinda squished.

Blackout Slush: This was just weird.  And sugary.

Rainbow Slush: Meh.  Didn't taste very rainbow-y.  Just fruit-slushy generic.

Classic Cruiser: I guess I liked this the best of the six weird drinks they introduced.  It's just cherry vanilla soda though, don't be fooled by the name.

Twisted Flamingo: Decent.

Lemonade Cream Cooler: Lemonade & vanilla ice cream.  Fairly good.  Didn't Baskin Robbins try this for Stranger Things?  ""Elevenade""?

Paradise Sunset: Blood orange is...not that much different than regular orange.  This tasted fine though

Grape Escape: this is just grape limeade, which I've already ordered, as grape limeade.  Tastes fine, but why is it a special drink?

**WENDY'S:**

Pretzel Baconator: Quite good, though it's a Baconator so it can't go wrong.  Who do I have to snarl at to get them to bring back the Italian Mozzarella burger/chicken sandwich?  That was the best thing Wendy's ever did!

**FREDDY'S STEAKBURGER:**

Grilled Cheese Steakburger: I guess I should've had this with the tomato paste layer in it?  I had them take it out.  Maybe that marred it.  I dunno.  Edible enough but didn't see the big deal, had it with cheese curds too, those are always nice to have.

**SUBWAY:**

Footlong Dippers: I had pepperoni and something else and I forget what.  Meh.  Not impressed.  Subway creeps me out because of Jared anyway.

**FIREHOUSE SUBS:**

Thanksgiving Turkey Sub: Godawful.  Had yellow greasy stuff dripping out of it that turned it into soggy glop.  The meat tasted fine but the stuffing was ruined.  Just wet and gross, the sogginess made it look like dog food left out in the rain. Would never eat this again even for a million bucks.  Had a cherry limeade with it from their fountain and that's the worst fountain drink I've ever had.  

**BLUE BELL ICE CREAM:**

Gooey Butter Cake: actual gooey butter cakes are better.  I didn't mind this but will probably not have it again.

A&W Root Beer Float ice cream: Their Dr. Pepper vanilla float ice cream was a bit better, but this is still fairly good, I'm on the fence with Blue Bell in general.  The Schwan's man who came by as a kid had vanilla ice cream with root beer ice swirl in it as a kid, in cup form, and those were GLORIOUS.

**HAAGEN-DAZS:**

Irish Cream Brownie ice cream: Pretty good, creamy mango is still the best H-D flavor.

**BEN & JERRY'S:**

Churn Out The Vote: Wasn't expecting this to be that good, but the pretzel flavored swirls really saved it.  Considering I was not impressed with Impretzively Fudged, this was a pleasant surprise!

**VAN LEEUWEN'S:**

Coffee Affogato: Just coffee & sweet cream ice creams mashed together, but REALLY GOOD.  Their best flavor so far (and I'm a big supporter of these guys for getting interesting ice cream flavors into mainstream grocery stores.)  In fact it's the best coffee flavor ice cream I've ever had from anyone and I'm not forgetting Jamoca Almond Fudge!

Praline Bun Cake: This was fairly good too.  I don't really like pralines but this was nice.

Brown Sugar Chunk: Not bad but not the best either.

**FROZEN-AISLE GROCERY STORE ITEMS:**

Kroger brand Spicy Salami N'duja Sausage & Burrata frozen pizza: Not bad but not as good as it could've been.  I think I'd prefer it in a thin crust.  Kroger's was also selling take home crispitos for awhile in their restaurant area, would like to bring those back.

Louisa's Sausage & Cheese toasted ravioli: probably their best flavor, I usually preferred plain old beef but this is a welcome substitute.

Tombstone Tavern Thin pizza: Pepperoni & sausage to be precise.  Average.

My name is Jordan and I'm a 27M who actually works in Real Estate, is super kind, and friendly. 

I'm looking to live in a luxury building in FiDi near the Fulton Stop. They tend to be a bit pricey, so usually what they do is take a larger one bedroom and put up a flex wall, so it works as a two bedroom. The flex wall can go up to the ceiling like a regular wall, and functions as a real wall. I really want to live in a luxury building because of of amenities including doormen, rooftops, lounges, and gyms. I'd also love to have an in-unit washer / dryer! I'm a real estate agent so we don't need anyone and I'm really great at my job. I actually have found some great spots, just need someone to live with me! 

I’m a born and bred New Yorker grew up on upper west side and have been living in Clinton hill bklyn for 2 1/2 years. I write musical theater and am a real estate agent. Running around the city trying to make deals happen. I love going to the movies, theater, concerts, and hiking! 27 y/o not a big partier. Looking to be roommates with someone who is chill and friendly (obviously :) ) -- Ideally someone who doesn't work full-time from home. Wanting to live near trains for better access. I’m very clean and don’t really cook that often. Move in date is either Feb 1 or March 1.

Was diagnosed ADD as a kid, was on meds (not sure which one) as a kid but stopped due to it upsetting my stomach. 

Adhd has been negatively impacting my life worse as time goes on (work, school, relationships, friendships, etc), so now I'm giving meds a try. My doc put me on a baby dose of 5mg, Xr. I feel that high feeling, but it's not too intense. What's concerning me is my heart rate. I was simply doing some house cleaning, nothing strenuous, and my HR was 115 (according to my smartwatch). I've been lounging on the couch now for over an hour and it's still at 90. 

I'm very sensitive to caffeine, and have high anxiety. Those two mixed together are terrible lol, but right now I feel like I drank too much coffee. If an energy drink has 150mg caffeine, I split it with my husband so I don't feel like I'm having a panic attack. It's stupid how sensitive I am :/

I've been reading through here and see that almost no one feels the 5mg, which is making me feel even more ridiculous. 
 
I otherwise really like it so far! My head has never been so quiet, which is helping me be so much more present with my family. I don't feel like I'm in that constant race against time. My intention today was to do some house cleaning, and I actually stuck to it! (Until I got that ~too much caffeine~ feeling)

Basically, I'm just wanting to know if this is typical when starting on it? If not, I'll be contacting my Dr tomorrow.

Started yesterday where I had eggs, bacon, and sausage for breakfast, snacked on a block of Parmesan throughout the day, had 2 pork chops for lunch and then tried cooking steak for dinner but got major ick and settled for 2 eggs…. Which I also barely finished and got the ick. Later that night I had a horrible headache and caved had 3 tiny tangerines and went to bed. I intended to be strict carnivore but now not so sure. 

Today so far I’ve just had heavy cream with my coffee and a big fillet of salmon and a pickle. Everything else is repulsing me. Don’t know what I’ll eat tonight. Been drinking hella water, adding electrolytes and also have my zero sugar sodas I cannot give up. 

Also my biggest thing I’m freaking out about is going to the movies without popcorn. I have a membership to AMC so I usually go pretty often and get the kids pack (extra small popcorn) with butter. I’m wondering if it would be detrimental to allow that as my guilty pleasure when I go. 

All in all, just struggling a lot more than I initially expected and it’s only day 2. Feeling guilty because I told everyone I was doing this and desperately want to experience the results everyone talks about. Just want to sleep all day and escape my headache.

My gf and I dated when we were in our late teens, early 20s, and broke up when I was assaulted. At the time, I was not as mentally and emotionally as aware of manipulation, coeersion, and assault as I am now, and even though I knew I didn't want it, at 19, I didn't think that mattered. I told my gf I had cheated and we broke up. Months later I was able to tell her the truth, followed by 2 years of not dating but toxic connection. I ended the toxic cycle and we parted ways, staying friends on Facebook but not having much of a relationship. 

Fast forward to 13+ years later, we began talking in the summer of 2023 and shortly after began dating again. We had multiple conversations about our breakup and how even though she understood, for a long time she believed I cheated on her and it would take time to fully trust me. I get that. That lack of trust doesn't just sit in the area of cheating though, it's permeating into other parts of our relationship. 

More consistently, what has been happening is she will make an assumption about something, and will not change her mind or feelings despite finding out new information.  I don't expect her feelings to magically change, but they don't change at all. 

For example, we had an argument last night and went to bed in silence. When I went to leave for work this morning, she was in the bathroom brushing her teeth. I knocked on the door and she stopped brushing (electric toothbrush, I could hear it) and I told her I was leaving. There was a moment of silence and then the toothbrush turned back on. Later, while continuing our argument from last night, she states that I came to the bathroom door, knocked, said nothing, and then just left. I asked why I would do that and she said something like, ""So you could say you tried."" 

It's not just in arguments either. The other day we were speaking about getting housing with a service animal or emotional support animal, which I have experience doing multiple times and in many different states. She insisted that it couldn't be done the way I said, despite my personal experience on many occasions. 

It seems like, quite often, the things I say are not trusted or taken at face value. 

I do understand trust takes time and effort and I have done what I can, and what she's asked. My phone is accessible for her 24/7 should she choose to go through it, which she has less than a handful of times. My notifications are on so she can hear when I get messages and I always tell her who is messaging me and typically what the message is about. I play videogames and when playing with others I play in her discord channel in a public voice channel. She has access to my location at all times. 

I answer every question she asks. I never lie to her. I don't pretend with her. But now, over a year after we've started dating, it just feels like the mistrust isn't going anywhere. I try and rationalize things because I can see a difference in how things are now versus how they were before, and in some ways she's gotten more trusting of me, but it seems like now it's not just one thing she doesn't trust me with/about, it's everything. 

I am on anxiety medication and I was going to therapy, but money and relocating to move in with her had put a pause on that. I have begun looking for another therapist but have yet to go to one. I had been in therapy for years prior to moving, and though there was a significant gap in treatment, I was in therapy in my teen years as well. She has not gone to therapy, doesn't read books or articles or watch videos or TikToks. Other than attempting, in the moment, to try and diffuse an argument differently, she does not try and educate herself on her own emotions and triggers, let alone coping mechanisms for them. I feel like I am burnt out on trying to use coping mechanisms with someone who consistently shuts them down in arguments and I know for a fact it's made me more defensive, which obviously makes things worse. 

She's been insisting that I don't listen to her when she tells me how she's feeling, and I do try to hear her. I try and ask questions to clarify when I don't understand. But a lot of her feelings are based on assumptions of scenarios that didn't happen. To her, I knocked on the door just to say I did it, then sent a text saying I was leaving because I was late, which was obviously a lie because I had time to get coffee. 

To me, I knocked and said I was leaving and she ignored me. I went downstairs and put her lunch out, then text her I had to leave because it was late and that her lunch was out and not to forget her laptop for work. When I gpsed the drive to work, it was significant faster than usual; I'm assuming because of the holidays. There's a coffee shop on the same street where I work and I stopped for coffee before going to work. 

When arguing, she said I lied about having to leave because it was late, because I couldn't leave because it was late and still get coffee. When I explained that normally leaving at that time did make me late, which she knew, and that I didn't know until I was already in my car that it wouldn't take that long. She asked ""You couldn't GPS it and find out?"" Like, implying I knew beforehand I left and was intentionally trying to lie to her. 

I don't know what to do. It's becoming exhausting. She tells me I never listen to her but I don't understand how knowing that something else happened, doesn't change how she feels at all. When the roles are reversed, I do give her the benefit of the doubt. If I think something happened a certain way and I find out information I was missing, I adjust accordingly. Feelings don't immediately go away, but I'm able to better understand and empathize with the situation. I don't feel like that's reciprocated. 

How do I become a better, more receptive listener when I'm triggered? How can I better address her feelings even when they stem from partial or assumed realities? I feel like I constantly under attack and I don't know what to do.

However, carrying bulky equipment and dealing with messy grounds can be a hassle. Enter No Normal Coffee, a unique coffee paste in a tube designed for on-the-go convenience. But does it live up to the hype? Let’s dive in.

Their USP – Coffee paste, easy to dispense and convenient.

**Product:** No Normal Coffee

**Price:** £14

**Verdict:** 7/10 

**Short Description:** A tube of coffee paste for outdoor adventures.

**Pros:**

* 100% Fairtrade Arabica beans
* 20 cups of coffee per tube (I got about 10, but I must like it strong!)
* Extremely portable and convenient. (Same size as a toothpaste tube)
* Versatile – can be mixed with water or eaten directly.
* Long shelf life and no refrigeration required.
* Ethically sourced ingredients.
* Reduced waste.
* Unique and enjoyable flavour profile.
* Built-in sugar content. No need for sweeteners.

**Cons:**

* Sweetened – may not appeal to those who prefer unsweetened coffee. (The company has indicated they may consider unsweetened versions in the future).
* Slightly higher cost per cup compared to some other coffee options.
* Two-week consumption recommendation once opened might be challenging for solo adventurers who only have coffee occasionally. But obviously the coffee can be enjoyed at home for breakfast.
* It can be messy – Thick paste, sticks to the cup etc.
* Needs a good stir!



# What is No Normal Coffee?

No Normal Coffee is a concentrated coffee paste packaged in a resealable aluminium tube, much like a toothpaste tube. Made from 100% Fairtrade Arabica beans from Colombia, sweetened with organic Swiss beet sugar, and thickened with natural ingredients, it offers a novel approach to enjoying coffee in the great outdoors. Simply mix a teaspoon (or more, I went for more) of the paste with hot or cold water and stir for an instant cup of coffee. Each tube provides up to 20 servings.

I've been getting incredibly sour or bitter shots with medium to medium light roast beans and nit sure what's going wrong.

I've been grinding finer to try to increase extraction, and also been trying longer ratios, higher pressures, but can't seem to get anything that is tasty on its own. 

My current recipe is 18g in, 45g out, a 2 bar pre infusion until I see the first drops, then ramping up to around 8 bar, and holding it until the puck degrades and then descending pressure. I do not use paper filters. I am also using RDT method before grinding and WDT as puck prep, then tamping relatively lightly. 

I also preheat the portafilter and basket on the top of my kettle, and am using the peak filter to condition my water. 

When grinding more coarsely with more traditional shot times of 5s pre infusion 40s total the coffee is unbearably sour. 

Even with shot times as long as 12s pre infusion, 55s total, sometimes over 1 min, the shot still tastes incredibly sour. When I go further it gets to being bitter, not sour anymore but not pleasant either.

When grinding more coarsely with more traditional shot times of 5s pre infusion 40s total the coffee is unbearably sour. 

Please let me know of any tips you have if you've had this problem as well! Relatively new to espresso, robot is my first machine and only just starting using regularly since I got the DF64 V2.

Thanks!

It should probably be a good thing but he's extremely independent. I can't really criticise him because I would probably be the same. We both had to be growing up in the foster system. 

But I feel like it's wrecking our relationship. He can't let things go. The way I see it, my success is his too. He was the guy making me food and bringing me coffee as I was cramming for my professional exams, the one who calmed me down when i said I wasnt good enough etc.

Where do I start?

Back in 2022 I (22F, at that time was 20) started seeing this guy Z I worked with. We only went out for about two months. We went out on a couple of dates, all was going well. One day we slept together and in the morning, I know I was acting weird but I was so on guard from previous times that he was going to completely lose interest after we slept together. After I leave I then do kind of shut down for the next couple of days waiting for the moment he tells me he’s no longer interested - so I understand I didn’t deal with things correctly here. Well well well, three days later he lets me know that he doesn’t think we are the right match. 

Two months later he’s in a relationship. 

My issue is, I’ve never been as infatuated and seemingly “into” someone since him. Like I would genuinely be imagining our life together and we weren’t ever even officially together. 

Since then I’ve been out with a few people but even ended things because I don’t feel my feelings are developing at all. 

Recently 4 months ago I met someone called A (24m) and we live about 2.5hrs apart so don’t get to see each other much. But he’s never been in a relationship before so I think he’s very eager for this to turn into one. I do like him a lot and we get on but the thing that’s holding me back is I feel he lacks a lot of motivation which is really important to me. He even asked me to be official and I said I want to get to know him better first so things aren’t off the cards. But he’s so nice and literally tells me I’m perfect. 

Two weeks ago Z messages me catching up on what we’ve been doing, jobs, life etc and then he also says that he realises he didn’t handle things right those couple of years ago and if i can forgive him if I’d like to meet up for a coffee. 

I told him I’m seeing someone and (he was always a bit too confident) asks me how serious and that if needed he will wait for me!

I wouldn’t meet up with Z while still seeing A, but I feel now I know Z wants to see me it’s really clouding my judgement with A. Still after all these years I can safely say I’m into and attracted to Z and he has that motivation in life! But am I putting him on a pedestal? 

Do I try things properly with A and if not see Z? But I feel my judgement is always going to be bias now I know Z wants to see me again 

Tl;dr guy I used to date has asked me out again and making me question current guy I’m dating. ",0,1735845388.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

It’s Ernie Castro here, back with another blog post.  I'm writing to you from Seattle, Washington, where the air is crisp and the coffee is strong. I've been thinking a lot about the City of Tacoma’s annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration, coming up on January 20th.  It's an event that always reminds me of the power of community and the importance of building bridges, literally and figuratively. ✊

I’ve lived in Seattle for a while now, but my roots are in the Philippines.  Growing up, I learned about the importance of community through countless fiestas and barangay gatherings. These experiences taught me the power of coming together, sharing stories, and supporting one another.  That sense of community is what makes me feel so connected to Tacoma, a city that embraces diversity and celebrates its unique cultural tapestry.  

This year’s theme, “Building Bridges,” speaks to the heart of what Dr. King stood for.  It's about understanding and acknowledging our differences, while recognizing the common ground that unites us.  It's about finding ways to bridge the gaps that divide us, to work together towards a common goal.  It’s about building a stronger Tacoma, brick by brick.  

The celebration will feature the presentation of the Lifetime Service Award and the Emerging Leader Award. It’s a chance to recognize the individuals who embody Dr. King’s vision of service and leadership. I’m excited to see who will be honored this year!  

The event also includes a community outreach fair, a chance for local organizations to share their missions and connect with the community.  It’s always inspiring to see the different organizations working together to make Tacoma a better place.  It reminds me of my time working at Zulily, where we were constantly collaborating with local businesses to create a platform that supported small businesses and entrepreneurs.  

If you’re in the Tacoma area, I highly recommend checking out the celebration. It’s a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the legacy of Dr. King and connect with your community.  It's a chance to reflect on our values and recommit to building a more just and equitable world, one bridge at a time. 😊",1,1735845333.0,Testaimediaplatform,0,1.0,False

or should I say, are you absorbing enough calories?


digestion is everything. here are the things you can do to improve digestion


ㅤ


diversify your microbiome

you do that by eating fermented foods like saurkraut, kimchi, pickles, plain whole yogurt and apple cider vinegar or take a probiotic supplement with a high strain content

ㅤ



feed your microbiome

you do that by eating prebiotics(fiber) like extra virgin olive oil, coffee, kiwis, asparagus, artichokes or take a prebiotic supplement, ideally inulin

ㅤ


improve gut lining

your gut wall is what absorbs your nutrients, damaging it, results into poor nutrient absorption and leaking
nutrients into your bloodstream, causing inflamation. you can fix that by eliminating foods that destroy the gut wall, like anti nutrients in foods, antibiotics, pesticides in our foods, processed sugar, and seed oils

ㅤ


 here are 3 supplements that I personally take to support digestion

-[digestion enzymes](https://a.co/d/a7zbWOh)(specifically take this one) 600 mg

-[betaine HCL](https://a.co/d/3MlmkF4) 650 mg (lower your dosage if you feel a burning sensation, vise versa, if you don't feel a burning sensation, you might want to increase your dosage)

-[glutamine](https://a.co/d/aXRU1Ng) 5 grams

take these with your meals, these supplements are very effective

ㅤ


if you take protein powder you're wasting your money if you aren't taking digestive enzymes

Today I have realised that I have now too become that person. Explore my living space and you would walk in and see good furniture, clear worktops, artwork on walls that has been carefully chosen and well placed lamps and candles along with a few plants. 

Behind closed storage doors though... it's bad. Very bad. A sideboard full of plant pots, years of letters and wine I'll never drink. A hall cupboard with dozens of bedding sets and towels, hundreds of bags for life, the overflow of toiletries from the bathroom and an ironing board without a cover. Oh, and two broken cat carriers. 

Head to the bathroom and there's a set of drawers full of all the toiletries known to man. In the spare room is a big cupboard full of books, paperwork, Christmas decorations, board games and general tat. The bedside table is full of random crap and loads of full notebooks. The desk is full of yet more notebooks and a drawer of random rubbish. A jar of used pens sits atop it. There is a storage unit full of DVDs, CDs and photos that never gets opened. 

The main bedroom had a long wall with fitted cupboards. One is full of many, many blankets and cushions. The two wardrobes are fit to burst with clothes, only about 2% of which I wear. Under the clothes are more cushions, a suitcase and two old fans. Oh, and a big plastic box of childhood belongings I took from my mums house. 

The living room is spared apart from the two cupboards and a drawer that I have packed full of half burnt candles, batteries, fairy lights and old appliances such as Roku sticks and Alexa devices. 

Then we have the kitchen... dear god, the kitchen. Two full cupboards or foods that would get me through a five year famine. One full of tuppaware that is missing either the lid or the tub along with devices I thought I needed but didn't. Smoothie maker, soup maker, soda stream amongst many others. There is a cleaning cupboard full of lovely smelling cleaning products that never get finished as I find a nicer new one. A cupboard filled with enough plates and bowls to cater a wedding. Then the many saucepans, baking dishes, cake tins and odd metal objects. There is also a small cupboard where random objects just go to die. Then there are the storage tubs on top of the fridge containing cat and dog food and treats. 

The main culprit can be found in the final cupboard... so many glasses and mugs. I really needed the vintage tea cups. So many funny mugs, mugs from holidays, mugs that look pretty, glass mugs, travel mugs. Glasses and wine glasses of various materials and colours and themes. Pumpkin shaped mugs, mugs with lids and straws for iced coffee. You get the idea. 

The mission to clear it all has begun. There have been moments of being close to tears. There are a lot of trips to the tip, charity shop and clothing bins ahead. 

Are you a fit to burst full of tat cupboard owner or are you a minimalist tidy hero? Anyone else going a new year clear out and already regretting it? ",18,1735845222.0,AskUK,35,1.0,False

Hi friends,

How do I add warmth and balance? Here are my ideas, from simplest to most drastic, I appreciate you comments/critique:

1. **Add small single seater on window side:** there isn't that much space so it'll have to be compact. Thinking a warm color like burnt orange or dark sage green or something
2. **Add additional warm color throw blanket on couch**
3. **Add large tall plant to the far side of the TV console**, with a dark colored pot
4. **Get rid of couch, switch to much more compact and low-level 2 seater:** so there is more space to add a chair on the window side, and even one on the side opposite of the window
   * Thinking of switching everything to low-level seating so I can use floor cushions too. Would also consider swapping to a lower level coffee table too.",1,1735845018.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

For the past 3 or so years, my sister (F21) has been making a mess of my (M18) home. She is a college dropout (after paying tuition fees) and can best be described as a self centered hoarder.

Every day over those three years I've been arriving to a mess, like a bomb was detonated in every room. I'd try to relax and avoid it, but the moment my mom comes home id be scolded and forced to clean it by myself.

My sister constantly ignores it or just forces me to do it (because if I don't, my mom will.) She has actually never done a single chore over this time period (not even exaggerating, laundry, dishes, NOTHING.)

Despite all this cleaning my mother refuses to confront my sister about it. I've tried time and time again to tell her what she's doing and how it affects everyone (my mom gets stressed out very easily and is a insane clean freak) but she just ignores me and always hits me with the same line: ""get a job."" This is the part that pisses me off. She always tells me ""I had a job at half your age!"" Then proceeds to tell me how stressful and terrible her childhood was.

I won't draw this out longer, but I am like an academic god compared to what she did in highschool (and you'd have to kill me to get me to drop out of college.) So I genuinely haven't had time to secure a job outside of the summer.

She sees me as inferior, and never speaks well of me in any situation just because I dont have a job. Then expects me to do everything for her? Just today I had to throw out month old chip bags, toss leftover eyelashes left on the table in the LIVING ROOM, throw out 2 half full coffee cups, clean a massive mess she made on the couch, and plenty of other common chores she refuses to do.

All of these messes are her and only her, my mom and I take time to make sure everything is clean and even dedicate Sundays to cleaning up the house for a fresh start on Monday. And after all this she still complains that her life sucks and cries to us about it. There are hundreds of other things I can be petty about, but this is the worst.

So...  AITA for not wanting to clean up after my careless sister?",2,1735844973.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False
1hs1kqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaticSnails/comments/1hs1kqn/dumbfounded_by_ebay_snail_seller/,dumbfounded by ebay snail seller.,"Hey reddit. Someone slap me back to reality. I'm looking for supportive snail-minded group snark.

I purchased some giant Ramshorn snails on ebay. Please don't ask why; I like snails. On 12/16 the seller shipped them. They arrived 12/19. I work from home, and I watched the mail carrier set them on the porch, so I grabbed them and unwrapped the package. I could smell something was amiss. 

I finished unpacking the poor snails outside in a snow bank and emptied the bag of brown shell water (yes, water) into a white pho bowl 🤢

Despite my senses telling me otherwise, I didn't have the heart to throw the stinky mess away until I had 24 hours proof. I waited and my husband rolled his eyes, avoiding the corner of the house where the bowl sat. My stupidity paid off because one sad snail poked an eye stalk out and proved me right. I moved him to pho bowl #2 and he won Snail Game. The rest didn't make it.

In the meantime I emailed this seller asking him why he sent so many large(!) snails in a crowded, sealed bag of water without air. There wasn't any  air. This was 12/19. FF to today. I didn't hear from him that whole time. I've since been refunded because I opened an ebay case and all that, game over.

Last night I'm watching Squid Game and I get 17 notifications in a row and my son is like, ""some dick is blowing you up"". He should not be watching Squid Game but he's the first born, it's okay. I pause Mingle only to see this seller sending me nonsense about using breather bags and how he's the most professional seller out there. He sends me a bunch of pictures of breather bags. He will not shut up about breather bags, it's all he'll talk about. Like 14 fucking messages about how professional he is, he pays extra, blah blah blah.

So maybe I am wrong about the breather bag but who the hell ships a grip of snails in a crowded bag of water? I'm now bickering with this guy because I'm punitive and autistic, I'm avoiding work, and I want him to stop harming these harmless creatures. Keep me honest! Is he wrong?

Another hit argument he made: he blamed the holiday mail delays for the snails' deaths, as if i can't reconstruct the tracking and see the story laid bare. On 12/9 a label was created. On 12/16 the post office received the Priority Mail package, and on 12/19 it was delivered. He needs to stop gaslighting Uncle Sam for every snail death.

By the way, Mingle was very stressful.

Someone chime in. Please. I have to fire someone in 1 hour and 51 minutes and I'm avoiding work until then. I'll make a coffee and BRB.

1hs1k5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1hs1k5z/thinking_about_facebook_ads_for_your_startup/,Thinking About Facebook Ads for Your Startup? Here’s What You Should Know ,"You’re hyped. Your startup’s ready to shine. Facebook has billions of users, and you’re thinking, *“I’ll just scoop up a few customers from there. Easy.”*

So you whip up a funnel—quiz, freebie, or some magical offer. You sprinkle in tracking pixels, spend hours writing *killer* ads, and convince yourself, *“Yeah, I’m about to crush this.”*

*“Let’s start small—£20/day should do it,”* you tell yourself. (Translation: *Just enough to get excited but not cry if it flops.*) Be patient, you think. *The algo needs to learn how to serve me.* At least, that’s what all the YouTubers say.

You write the copy, hooky AF. You design the visuals (Thumbstopping). You even record a video or two or yourself speaking. You’re app / site / tool is solving problems left and right in these ads. *“How can they NOT want this?”*  
  
You hit publish. Woop! Now it’s just you, the refresh button, and the sweet anticipation of clicks pouring in like confetti at a parade. It's working, it's working!!!!

Then… *oh.*  
  
Clicks are coming, sure, but… no sign-ups. People are bouncing off your page faster than you can say *“CPC.”*

Okay, no problem. Time to put on your ad-optimization cape. You tweak the targeting, swap out creatives, even whisper to the algorithm, *“Please, just ONE sale?”*

But still… nothing.

You figure, *“It’s just the start. Gotta give it time.”* After five days (and a lot of coffee and fretting), you shut it down, muttering, *“What a failure. Nothing I do is going to work”*

Turns out, Facebook ads aren’t the magic wand you thought they’d be. It’s more like solving a puzzle where the pieces keep changing shape—and some are missing.

Because here’s the truth: ads don’t just sell stuff; they *expose the cracks in your funnel.* Maybe your offer isn’t landing. Maybe your site’s confusing. Or maybe your dream audience isn’t ready yet.

Welcome to digital marketing.

But here’s the thing: this first campaign it’s not failure—it’s *feedback.* And after a few days you regroup, you re-test, you tweak. You figure out what works and what doesn’t. And then you try again. And again. And again and you fail over and over and over.

Until something works - A green shoot, an audience, a bit of creative.... and you being you.... you capitalise.

**The Takeaway:**

Running Facebook ads is like learning to ride a bike without handlebars—except the bike’s on fire, the ground’s icy, and you’re somehow still excited to keep going.

So if you’re diving into ads, keep your sense of humor, stay curious, and don’t forget: even the flops get you closer to figuring it out.

And you? You’re not just running ads. *You’re becoming a legend.*

I made some little moodboards and will add some commentary for each! Could you please help me with my roots?

1: Warm weather - Summer is my favorite season and I love the clothing that goes with it. I love bright and airy, comfy and feminine. Upper left is basically what I’d wear around the house, a snug small top and loose pants. Upper mid-left is a “wear anywhere” for me, a tank top and palazzo pants with a fun design. I always like my outfits to have a little spark/interest. Upper mid-right is when I want to feel a little clean girl/princessy/preppy. I love the looseness of the top, very breezy, and the tennis skirt is cute and has shorts underneath. Upper right, the bird dress, is just fabulous and fun. I would wear it with flip flops and have a great day. Lower left shorts look so comfortable. I don’t always love shorts so I was really happy about these. Lower mid-left is another lovely sundress. I adore pink and I love how it’s so easy but pretty. I can pop it on in 10 seconds but also feel flouncy and pretty. Lower mid-right is something I would wear to go do errands, especially at the beach. Lower right is cute and easy. I like the sweet details on the top. I also appreciate the iced coffee.

2: Cold weather - cold is less my favorite but hey I try to have a good time anyway. Upper left has a comfy jacket with great colors. I would also wear the whole outfit. It looks practical, comfortable, and fun. Upper mid-left is cute and cozy. I love the flowers and thick fleece. The magenta pops make me smile! I like a soft hat in the winter, as well. Upper mid-right has a little less color than I would usually go for but I really like the casual and slightly beachy feel of it. I like a sweater that is not too fuzzy/woolly/hairy. I didn’t always like jeans until I found wide leg jeans. I prefer them very relaxed! And I kind of live in Uggs in the cold. Upper right: I love a black or white snug base layer with loose sporty layers on top. Lower left: speaking of, I always feel happy and comfortable in sporty ski wear. I like the loose and puffy fits, not the new sleek pants. I like a snug top, though. Lower mid-left is my lazy go-to, a fun hoodie, loose jeans, Uggs. Lower mid-right echoes a kind of coat I have for work, a little dressier. Though I do dress it up a little more. Lower right is a comfy outfit for mild days.

3: DRESSES 😍 - sorry I repeated one by accident. I love dresses. I like feeling “dressed up” but I don’t like feeling restricted or like my clothes are so delicate they’ll rip and tear. These are some styles I adore. I love little flowers, bright colors, ruffles, stretchy lace, non-fuzzy knit, and fun prints like fruits.


**Overall:** I think maybe I have 🌸 but it might not be first. I don’t think I have any 🌙 because I don’t like when things feel destructed/decayed and my black is usually very clean and/or soft.

-------------------------------------------------

Black decor can create a striking and sophisticated ambiance in any space. However, to elevate the aesthetic appeal of black decor, choosing the right color pairings is essential. The goal is to complement black's intensity while adding warmth and vibrancy to your environment. Let's explore some of the best color options that work beautifully alongside black decor.

### Classic White

One of the most timeless pairings is black and white. This classic combination offers bold contrast, creating a crisp and clean look. White helps to lighten the space, making it feel airier. Use white furniture, trim, or accessories to enhance the sharpness of black elements. Consider a white rug under a black coffee table for a stunning focal point.

### Bold Red

Red is a powerful color that energizes spaces. Pairing red with black decor adds drama and sophistication. You can use red accents in pillows, throws, or artwork to bring a touch of passion into the room. This combo is perfect for a chic living room or stylish dining area.

### Soft Pastels

For a softer approach, pastel colors can create a beautiful contrast with black. Think light pink, baby blue, or mint green. These colors introduce a refreshing vibe without overpowering the elegance of black decor. Use pastel shades in accessories like curtains, cushions, or wall art for a balanced look.

### Metallic Gold

Gold adds a touch of luxury when paired with black. This duo creates a glamorous environment that exudes opulence. Consider using gold lighting fixtures, picture frames, or decorative accents to incorporate warmth and richness into your decor. The shimmer of gold against a black backdrop can create an eye-catching focal point.

### Deep Jewel Tones

Jewel tones like emerald green, sapphire blue, or ruby red pair incredibly well with black. These vibrant colors bring depth and sophistication, enriching the overall decor palette. Use jewel-toned rugs or statement furniture pieces to add character to spaces adorned with black. The lushness of these colors can create a striking contrast that feels both inviting and luxurious.

### Cool Grey

Grey is a versatile neutral that can perfectly complement black. Light greys can add subtle contrast, while darker greys create a more monochromatic look. This pairing offers a sleek and modern aesthetic. Consider using grey curtains or furniture to balance the intensity of black while keeping the space feeling contemporary.

### Bright Yellow

For a playful and energetic approach, bright yellow is a cheerful companion to black decor. This pairing can create a fun and lively atmosphere. Use yellow in accent pieces such as cushions, art, or decorative vases. The brightness of yellow juxtaposed with black creates an eye-catching visual that can energize the entire room.

### Earthy Tones

Colors such as terracotta, burnt sienna, or olive green offer a natural and grounding effect when combined with black. These earthy tones introduce warmth and a sense of coziness. Consider using these colors in larger pieces like sofas or area rugs to soften the starkness of black decor.

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
### Neutral Beige

Beige and black create a chic and timeless look. The warmth of beige balances out the boldness of black, resulting in a harmonious setting. Use beige fabric in furniture or art to tie the space together naturally. This color combination works wonderfully in both traditional and modern interiors.

### Choosing the Right Pairing for Your Space

When selecting color pairings for black decor, consider the mood you want to create. For an elegant ambiance, go for gold or jewel tones. If you're aiming for a light and refreshing feel, explore pastels or cool greys. Use these strategies to enhance your black decor and craft an inviting, stylish space that reflects your unique personality.

In your design journey, remember that the right color pairings can completely transform the aesthetics of black decor. Whether you prefer classic, modern, or vibrant styles, you have numerous options at your fingertips. Explore these combinations, and don’t hesitate to mix and match to find what works best for your space.

The Psychological Impact of Color Combinations in Interior Design
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Color is more than just a visual stimulus; it's a powerful tool that can influence mood, emotions, and even behaviors. When it comes to interior design, the combination of colors can set the tone for a space, impacting how you feel and interact within it. Understanding the psychological impacts of various color combinations can help you create a home or office that not only looks beautiful but also fosters the right emotional environment.

### Understanding Color Psychology

Colors can elicit strong emotional responses. Here are some common associations:

- **Red:** Energetic and passionate, often used to stimulate excitement.
- **Blue:** Calming and serene, associated with trust and stability.
- **Yellow:** Cheerful and vibrant, promotes happiness and creativity.
- **Green:** Refreshing and balanced, connected to nature and tranquility.

- **Black:** Elegant and modern, can create a sense of sophistication and depth.
- **White:** Pure and clean, promotes simplicity and spaciousness.

### How Color Combinations Affect Spaces

Combining colors can either harmonize or clash. Here’s how specific pairings can change your interior environment:

#### Elegant Monochrome

Using varying shades of one color, such as different tones of blue or gray, can create a soothing atmosphere. It adds depth while maintaining harmony. Monochrome schemes work well in bedrooms and living rooms where relaxation is key.

#### Bold Contrasts

Pairing contrasting colors like black and white or blue and orange can energize a space. This method captures attention and inspires creativity. You might consider using two strong colors in a home office or a creative studio to stimulate innovative thinking.

#### Nature Inspired

Combining earthy tones like brown, green, and soft blue can create a calming, natural feel. This combination connects you to the outdoors, promoting relaxation and harmony. Such palettes are ideal for living rooms and spaces meant for social interaction.

#### Warm and Cozy

Colors like reds, oranges, and yellows can create a warm and inviting atmosphere. These hues stimulate conversation and a sense of belonging, making them perfect for dining areas and family rooms. However, it's essential to balance these warm tones with cooler accents to avoid overwhelming the space.

#### Serene Spaces

Cool colors like soft blues and greens create peaceful environments that are perfect for rest and relaxation. These combinations are ideal for bedrooms or home offices where concentration and tranquility are paramount.

### Choosing the Right Color Combinations

Here are a few tips on how to choose the right color combinations for your interior design:

- **Consider the purpose of the room:** Identify what you want to achieve in each space. A calming palette works for bedrooms, while lively colors can energize home offices.
- **Test with samples:** Before making a final decision, paint a small section of the wall to see how the colors look in different lighting throughout the day.
- **Consider natural light:** The amount and direction of natural light will affect how colors appear in your space. South-facing rooms will have warmer tones, while north-facing rooms will typically feel cooler.
- **Use accents wisely:** If you desire a bold look, consider using bright colors in accessories or smaller furniture, allowing you to easily change the look without committing to a full-wall color.

### Final Thoughts

Your interior design choices can significantly impact your mood and mental state. By understanding the psychological effects of color combinations, you can create spaces that reflect your personality, enhance your well-being, and improve your daily life. Remember, the right colors can help foster a soothing sanctuary, a creative workspace, or a vibrant gathering place. So choose wisely, and let the colors transform your space!

### Conclusion

Choosing the right color pairings for black decor not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of your space but also touches upon the psychological aspects of how colors interact and influence our emotions. The dynamic nature of black allows it to serve as a versatile backdrop that can adapt to various color schemes, fostering unique atmospheres that cater to your personal style.

When exploring color pairings, consider the boldness of white, which creates a classic contrast and radiates sophistication. Soft pastels like blush or mint are also excellent for adding a gentle, calming touch, balancing the intensity of black without overwhelming the senses. Earth tones like olive green or terracotta introduce warmth, bringing an inviting essence into your space while retaining an air of modernity.

It’s essential to remember the significance of color psychology in your choices. Colors can evoke feelings of tranquility, joy, or sophistication, significantly shaping how you perceive your home. Therefore, aligning your color selections with the desired mood will ensure your space is not only visually appealing but also emotionally supportive.

Ultimately, the best color pairings for black decor hinge on your personal preferences and the atmosphere you wish to create. By understanding the impact of different colors and their relationships with each other, you can transform your space into an inviting haven that reflects your unique personality and taste. Embrace your creativity, and let your design journey be guided by colors that inspire and resonate with you.",1,1735844612.0,BesteDekoSchwarz,0,1.0,False

Leftfielders

2004: Manny Ramirez

One of the finest hitters in baseball history having arguably his best season--certainly while in Boston--Manny led the league in home runs (43), slugging percentage (.613) and OPS (1.009). This season also included a [particular highlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCdp-pSA8kc) on the glove side of his game, the most impressive gem of his long, undistinguished career as a fielder.

2007: Manny

2007, on the other hand, was Manny’s worst season in Boston. While his batting statistics at first glance look excellent, if not to his usual standard (126 OPS+ compared to 155 overall for his Boston tenure), this relative down year at the plate combined with increasingly nigh-unfathomable. execrable defense as well as decreasing availability to produce an overall season only slightly better than replacement level (1.1 rWAR, 1.2 fWAR).

2013: Jonny Gomes

Saying Gomes played left field for the Red Sox in 2013 is misleading in two different ways—firstly, Gomes equaled Manny in his butchery with the leather (-62 career DRS for Gomes, -129 for Manny in twice as many games). Secondly, he was a platoon player, a masher of southpaws but weak against same side pitching. His declining abilities (at 32 he had only two more seasons left in a big league uniform) combined with a relative uncharacteristic split to bring his numbers against either handed pitchers into near parity (.795 OPS against LHP and .745 against RHP). Of course, Gomes is still foundly remembered by Boston fans, for his exuberant personality that embodied the ragtag miracle team, as well as not a few clutch hits.

2018: Andrew Benintendi

The best season of Benintendi’s career remains both a fond and bittersweet memory. Following a strong rookie campaign that likely would have won him the annual award if not for a certain behemoth in New York, Benni improved slightly in every aspect of his game, including career highs in WAR, doubles, walks, stolen bases, OPS, OPS+, slugging, runs scored, hits, even triples. He even made a legendary catch in the ALCS against Houston that earned the cover of Alex Speier’s *Homegrown*. At only 23 his first two seasons in front of the Wall matched more than favorably against Carl Yastrzemski’s, and every observer could have reasonably expected that left field would be a lock for at least the next decade.

Centerfielders

2004: Johnny Damon

“Looks like Jesus, throws like Mary, acts like Judas.” Damon, the last major acquisition of Dan Duquette before the sale to John Henry was effected before the 2002 season, happily coincided his best season in Boston with the 2004 championship. Damon made up for his declining speed with career highs in home runs and walks to continue to act as the prime catalyst for baseball’s best offense. Indeed, he showed no long-term complications from his frightful concussion in the 2003 playoffs outside of a pronounced resemblance to the GEICO caveman. On the other side of the ball, Damon’s ever-weak arm was still somewhat mitigated by his range in center (though that too was declining, down to -5 runs according to UZR) and even facilitated the aforementioned iconic display of defensive hustle by Manny Ramirez.

2007: Coco Crisp

Crisp, the anointed successor to Damon in both center and, ostensibly, in the leadoff spot, had already suffered through an atrocious first season in Boston, equally beset by injury and ineffectiveness on both sides of the ball. 2007 showed little improvement at the plate (83 OPS+ instead of 77), though his excellent defensive work (15 DRS, 25 UZR) kept him in place as the starter until the September debut of Jacoby Ellsbury. Unfortunately for both him and the Red Sox, Crisp’s 2005 breakout season in Cleveland failed to resurface until he reached Oakland in 2010. Still one of the best names in baseball history, let alone in Boston’s.

2013: Jacoby Ellsbury

Ellsbury’s preference for odd numbered seasons doubly served the Red Sox in good stead this year. He not only had the best campaign of his career outside of that anomalous 2011 but cashed in on it to deprive the Yankees of 158 million dollars over the next eight years. More specific to 2013, he led the league in stolen bases (52) for the third time, which would be impressive enough to warrant special mention, but he accomplished this feat while only being caught four times. That success percentage ranks third all time among those with fifty attempts, bested by Jimmy Rollins’ 2008 and of course Shoehi Ohtani. ([Credit to reddit user allthatglittersis](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1fb4w8t/shohei_ohtani_has_the_5th_highest_single_season/)\_\_\_\_)

2018: Jackie Bradley Jr

If wildly inconsistent from month to month, if not week to week, JBJ displayed a stolid skillset by 2018—in exchange for a slightly below league average bat, he was the best centerfielder in baseball in a time beset with great centerfielders. Owing to this remarkable constituency he but once won the Gold Glove, albeit that having come in the year under examination. With his penchant for sudden hot streaks, he also provided more offense than typical of from a glove-first batsman ensconced at the bottom of his team’s lineup. A particularly timely display against Houston, of course, earned him the ALCS MVP.

Rightfielders

2004: Gabe Kapler

Kapler, of course, was not supposed to take the majority of time in right field, and would have functioned as a serviceable fourth outfielder if not for Trot Nixon’s injury-plagued season. As a result, the Red Sox received replacement level production; Kapler himself “contributed” a .238/.294/.305 slash against right-handed pitchers, which made up roughly sixty percent of his plate appearances.

2007: JD Drew

Depending on who you ask, JD Drew was either an expensive disappointment or a strong supporting character while in Boston. 2007, his first season after signing a four-year, seventy-million-dollar contract, perhaps best exemplifies his tenure: excellent on-base percentage, surprisingly decent defense for a guy with degenerative knees playing the worst right field in baseball, and a grand slam in the ALCS. Though maligned throughout his career as injury-prone and a wimp, Drew played in at least 137 games in three of his five seasons in Boston and made the all-star team in a fourth.

2013: Shane Victorino

Another veteran National League outfielder who hits a grand slam in the ALCS in his first season in Boston, Shane Victorino had an excellent 2013 on both sides of the ball. Formerly a Gold Glove centerfielder for the Phillies, Victorino moved into right field and won his fourth and final such award for Boston to go with his usual above-average offensive package. By WAR, this was actually his best season (6.0); nonetheless, in hindsight it is easy to see the quick decline that soured his next and final two years as a Red Sox, given his age (already 32), drops in walks (53 to 25, or from eight percent to 4.7), stolen bases (39 to 21), triples (16 to 7 to 2), games played (154 to 122), and isolated power (.157, compared to .212 in 2011). He *did* have a league-leading 18 hit by pitches.

This has nothing to do with anything, but Victorino had more HBP in his career than double plays grounded into: 81-60.

2018: Mookie Betts

Too soon? The best season of one of the two best players in baseball that doubled as one of the best seasons by *any* Red Sox player ever, Betts led the league with 10.7 WAR, 129 runs scored, a .346 batting average, .640 slugging, won a Gold Glove, and had surprisingly the only 30-30 season of his career.

Designated Hitters:

2004: David Ortiz

All Papi did was smash forty-one homers, drive in 139 runs, and slash .301/.380/.603 (145 OPS+). He was second in slugging, total bases, home runs, RBI, and third in doubles. Overall, one of his weaker seasons in Boston. Oh, he also had a couple of game-winning hits against the Yankees in the ALCS.

2007: Big Papi

This time he led the league in walks and on-base percentage, while finishing sixth or higher in WAR, batting average, slugging, OPS, runs scored, total bases, doubles, home runs, and runs batted in. As in 2004, he also ranked fourth in MVP voting. No particularly iconic post season hits, however.

2013: “This is our f\*cking city!”

Here we go again: eighth or better in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS, total bases, home runs, RBI, walks, and led the league with a ridiculous 27 intentional bases on balls. Obviously, he won the Silver Slugger in all three seasons, but finished a mere tenth in MVP voting this time. Did have a few more postseason displays, as well as that year-defining expletive.

2018: JD Martinez

Clearly just copied Papi’s 2007, down to finishing fourth in MVP voting.

Bench

2004: Youkilis, Nomar, Cabrera, Doug Maribelli, Dave McCarty, Trot Nixon, Doug Mientkiewicz, Dave Roberts

Maribelli, Wakefield’s personal catcher, had his career year (.281/.368/.525 slash, nine homers in only 182 plate appearances). Dave McCarty was a glove-first first baseman and sometime left-handed reliever. Mientkiewicz was just a glove-first first baseman. When healthy Nixon was his typical self, smacking right handed pitchers around enough to put up excellent rate stats (.315/.377/.510). David Roberts’ Steal is baseball legend, but he also functioned as a strong fourth/fifth outfielder down the stretch (94 OPS+ in 101 plate appearances).

2007: Alex Cora, Eric Hinske, Wily Mo Pena, Maribelli, Tacoby Bellsbury

Your typical light hitting reserve infielder, Cora’s 2007 is best remembered for what he did not do—take over second base from a struggling rookie. Well into the utility player phase of his career, former 2002 Rookie of the Year award winner Eric Hinske hit slightly better than Cora while fielding considerably worse. Wily Mo Pena had been acquired for Bronson Arroyo and waived to the Nationals for a player to be named later (Chris “Not the one that played for the A’s and Astros” Carter). Maribelli’s bat was as dead as Marley, and he would prove it by never playing another game. Tacoby Bellsbury had such an excellent cup of coffee that he was Boston’s primary center fielder in October.

2013: Daniel Nava, Mike Carp, Iglesias, David Ross, Jackie Bradley Jr

Signed out of indie ball, Nava hit a grand slam in his first major league at-bat in 2010. For 2013 he had the best season of his career as Boston’s fourth outfielder/Gomes’ platoon partner. Mike Carp played the role of Eric Hinske, except he actually hit; his 139 OPS+ was second best on the team, behind only David Ortiz. David Ross played the role of Doug Maribelli, except this time he was Jon Lester’s personal catcher and hit decently for a backup backstop. JBJ was actually the Opening Day center fielder, but was not yet ready for the majors.

2018: Brock Holt, Christian Vazquez, Blake Swihart, Hanley Ramirez, Steven Pearce, Ian Kinsler

Brockstar came back from a career-threatening concussion to not only put up his best hitting numbers of his career but also to become the first player to hit for the cycle in a postseason game. Swihart had gone from Catcher of the Future to fringe player by 2018, and would be DFA’d the next spring. Vazquez had gone from Catcher of the Future to oft-injured backup backstop, though he had a career year out of nowhere in 2019. After a solid April, Hanley Ramirez hit poorly (and allegedly became the sole negative presence in the clubhouse) and was released by June. Steven Pearce and Ian Kinsler were both stretch run pick-ups, the first to cover southpaws in Moreland’s stead and the other to fill the gaping hole at second base. Pearce of course did so well in the regular season and World Series that Dombrowski would bring him back in 2019 for 6 million dollars.

Not so fun fact: 2019 was the last season for Swihart, Ramirez, Pearce and Kinsler.",3,1735844339.0,redsox,5,0.64,False

Firstly, I am on warming and register and I was trained to take orders then get warming. I usually am fine by myself since I’ve tried to master the multitasking of flipping back and forth.

Today it was such a jumble. In my head it made more sense to ring up a customer and if they had no food items, grab the next customer, but I wouldn’t go beyond 2-3 customers before I stopped them and went back to warming to do 1-2 items and then rotate.

I did this because my sv was yelling for me to “get the line down” and hurry up taking orders.

This is all while I am also focusing on coffees printing. I have bad adhd but I try not let that stop me because once I get the rotation going I’m fine.

Apparently though, I got “multiple orders from customers wrong” but the only order I messed up was a lady and after that I made sure to be strict and read the orders back.

My lead said she didn’t hear me but chaos was ensuing on the bar and I highly doubt she’d hear me read anything while she was dealing with drinks (even if she wanted to).

My other barista kept running back to warming to help me but that threw me off because **just let me do my shit bro** I get it I may get a little behind but seriously this was irritating me. 

I mean I was grateful until my lead said that the other barista should stop coming to help me. When I told her it was fine and I could handle it and was, she said, “No you weren’t.”

The irritation worsened.

Then to pour fucking salt on the wound she said, “The rush I dealt with isn’t something you can handle.”

I nearly lost my shit. Bro I have done rushes before and been told by my other sv that I crushed it. So for her to say that felt like a slap in the face.

I then go back to register and a younger lady and old woman are coming from opposite directions at the register. The younger lady allows her first and I beckon her over only to hear: “Do you know what this is?” And shows her cane.

I blink and ask, “Excuse me? I don’t understand.” 

She walks closer and asks, “Are you stupid? This is cane and you’re asking me to run?”

At this point I just feel my entire soul deflate and take her order as kindly as possible. 

I hate when people treat me like I’m disabled and can’t do shit. It drives me up the fucking wall. One day I mess up and my reputation I worked so hard to build and bust my ass for goes up in smoke.",3,1735844322.0,starbucks,2,0.8,False

1hs11rr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hs11rr,Butchers block small crack. Help needed ,"I'm new to woodworking of any kind and decided to take on a L shaped coffee bar after my contractor ran off.

I purchased 1.5 in butchers block from lowes for the counter and back splash. Made sure to let it acclimate for over week. 

I sanded it at 120 in preparation for finishing, everything was fine, nothing out of the ordinary but when I went to sand at 220 for my final go I notice that a crack had formed about 3.5 inches long starting from a knot in the wood and ending at the glue seem. There are no screws or holes made anywhere near that crack, it's dead center on the long side of the counter. 

Is this something I can fill and then sand with wood glue or are there other, better options to remedy this before finishing my project. Is this something I should worry about. 

Any advice or tips would be appreciated and I apologize if my terminology is wrong.

hardcore mode:

* cold showers in the morning (sounds like torture but hear me out). started with 30 seconds, now at 2 mins. feels like hitting ur brain's reset button
* deleted all my bookmarks/saved posts. ur brain is like a browser w too many tabs open, sometimes u gotta force close that
* switched from coffee to green tea w l-theanine. way cleaner energy, no more feeling like a crackhead by 3pm
* started doing ""dopamine detox sundays"" where i literally just sit with my boredom. first few weeks were hell but now my brain actually enjoys doing normal again

the weird but effective stuff:

* breathing exercises but not the meditation bs everyone talks aboutt. look up ""box breathing"" - literally takes 2 mins and stops ur brain from going 300mph
* bought one of those light therapy lamps bc i live somewhere where the sun forgot to exist. use it while working, brain actually feels awake now ( also works on the morning)
* started writing shit down by hand instead of typing. something about it makes ur brain process stuff better, idk the science but it works
* got a time-locking container for my phone. sounds extreme but it works. lock that up for 4 hours and watch ur brain come back online

social media detox but make it realistic:

* instead of deleting apps, made my phone grayscale. suddenly tiktok/insta looks boring as hell. i dont even wanna scroll naturally
* unfollowed everyone except actual friends and like 5 accounts that make me learn stuff
* blocked reddit during work hours 
* turned off all notifications except calls/texts from actual humans. ur brain doesn't need to know every time someone likes ur tweet

big brain hacks:

* found out most of my brain fog was from mouth breathing at night . fixed my nose breathing, sleep actually works now
* started taking lions mane supplements (not the sketchy kind). took like 2 weeks but memory got way better
* learned about ""ultradian rhythm"" - basically work in 90 min blocks then take actual breaks. stops ur brain from feeling fried
* started doing ""mind dumps"" before bed - write down everything in ur brain so it stops spinning when ur trying to sleep. game changer 

the most underrated tips:

* fix ur posture. ur neck position affects blood flow to ur brain. got one of those laptop stands + better chair and it helped more than expected
* get ur eyes checked  had minor vision problems i didn't know about, fixing that reduced my headaches by like 90%
* started using ""binaural beats"" while working (sounds like some hippie thign but there's actual science behind it). helps me focus way better

bonus tip that sounds fake but trust: chew gum while studying/working. increases blood flow to ur brain (i guess) . works surprisingly well when u need to focus",188,1735843586.0,getdisciplined,31,0.97,False

1hs101x,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1hs101x/help_boyfriend_has_serious_adderall_addiction/,Help! Boyfriend has serious Adderall addiction issues,"My bf has ADHD and has been taking Adderall for many years. I don’t know exactly how long but we’ve been together for 3 years and he was already taking it for some years before meeting me. 

At first his doctor prescribed him 10mg daily but he often took two pills, i.e. 20mg. So even though he got 30 pills monthly, one bottle finished in 15 days. When he doesn’t take the pills, he suffered from withdrawal.

The withdrawal symptoms were: he sleeps all day long (going to bed at midnight and waking up at 3-4pm), extremely depressed, not willing to do anything and says he can’t do anything without Adderalls.

He discussed his problem with the doctor, then the doctor prescribed him 15mg. But he still often took two pills a day, which makes it 30mg. So he still had the same problem.

The doctor finally increased his dose to 20mg. Maybe he followed that for the first few days, and soon started taking two pills again, i.e. 40mg. 

He finally admitted that he has addiction issues and asked me to hide the pills from him and give him one pill a day every morning. 

At first I hid his bottle somewhere in the house, but we live together and he easily found the bottle and took more pills. So eventually I took the bottle with me to my work and brought him a pill every day when I come home so that he takes it the morning after.

It seemed to be working for a while. Then I found out that he got a new refill which he didn’t tell me about, and has been taking 3 pills (60mg) a day. 

He gave the second bottle to me, so I was hiding two bottles from him. When the first bottle he gave me was about to finish, he got a third bottle and gave it to me. 

One day, I decided to count the number of the pills in the third bottle that I haven’t opened yet. It should have been intact as I was still giving him pills from the second bottle and supposedly he gave me the third one as soon as he received it.

Turned out that there were only 15 pills, instead of 30 he gets prescribed. Right, he kept 15 pills from the bottle and gave me the rest. I asked him about it and he admitted that he’s been taking 60mg daily — one pill I bring him everyday, and two pills out of the 15 pills he secretly kept.

I read that “The maximum Adderall IR dosage for ADHD is 40 mg per day.” and “Studies have looked at dosages of up to 60 mg per day and haven't found additional benefits to taking over 20 mg per day.”

I am seriously worried about his health. Once he had an extreme chest pain and he suspected a heart attack. He said it could be a side effect of Adderall. We went to ER but gave up after waiting for 3 hours at night. The next day, he went to ER by himself and didn’t find out much.

Also he suffers from a headache pretty much everyday and takes Tylenol and Advil all the time.

Adderall gives him eating disorder as well. From Monday to Friday, he barely eats anything. He says it’s because Adderall makes him not hungry. He drinks a coffee with lots of espresso shots in the morning, skips lunch, and has dinner with me but eats smaller portion than me. (Fyi, I’m a skinny 5’3/90lbs girl and he’s a 6’ guy and he eats half of what I eat.) On weekends, he usually doesn’t take Adderall so he does binge eating. It can’t be healthy.

I have repeatedly communicated my concerns with him, but he doesn’t make enough effort to fix his addiction issues and shows this attitude of “it’s not a big deal.”

What can I do? I considered talking to his doctor as he is not telling his doctor that he’s taking 60mg a day. But I have no idea who the doctor is and not sure if it’s the right thing to do. Anybody has had similar issues? How did you overcome it? Thank you.

Edit: fyi, he is taking Adderall XR. (lasts 12 hours)

Single, childfree with a bit of the social anxiety. It's not completely terrible because I have been working on it for a long time. My current job actually made things better for me.


Not looking for an immediate meet if you're local, I would like to spend time getting to know you and your mind.


Interested in a long term friendship, relationship, companionship with a passionate, very assertive, and hopefully nerdy type of woman. Totally, completely not perfect. I have my imperfections and flaws. 


I enjoy science fiction, horror, and dramas. Reading about mysteries and the unknown. I play some games in my spare time, which I have a lot of lol, but it's not important that you do.


My favourite food is pizza, I may or may not have a coffee addiction (I totally do). I don't live alone, but with a roommate who is also a sibling. I am not into music as much as I used to be, but will definitely enjoy receiving a recommendation. I grew up listening to so many styles, but indie rock, metal, punk an hardcore were my preferred genres.


I no longer drink alcohol, I have quit smoking cigarettes and feel better for it, I don't do any drugs except for a bit of cannabis - but that's not a lot and I don't need it really.


I am employed full time, and aside from work I don't really go out much any more. I am a homebody and looking forward to meeting another person who maybe shares that. It's not that I never want to go out, obviously I would love to spend time with you going for walks, eating a tasty treat in a cafe, or window shopping for the afternoon. I prefer simplicity and would be very content just having you by my side.


Looking to engage in hand holding, giving neck massages and back massages, terms of endearment, cuddling, long deep conversations about everything, and humour to keep it positive.


I am totally not perfect, and I am very excited to possibly meet my perfectly imperfect match. I don't want fancy style, or big lavish lifestyle. I don't have particular needs for appearance and I am not superficial. I would like to say that I am not an athletic type, and enjoy the company of another person who is also that way. I don't want to be disrespectful, but I do prefer the plus size type.


5'10, white, very short brown hair, glasses, 165, casual style and very easy going.


I'm open to friends and LDR. Seeking monogamy, childfree only, pet friendly, chat, sharing huge cozy blankets, compassion, mutual respect, and love.


If anything here is standing out to you, or you're bored and just want to engage in conversation, reach out and say hi!

We are currently trying to sort out our monitoring situation and deciding on investing in a wireless IEM (or wired) setup or using floor wedges.

Some complications:

\- Our environment is small spaces, bars, coffee shops, weddings, etc. We don't have a drummer - yet - but may add one in the future.

\- We are an acoustic duo playing mostly acoustic instruments and singing.

\- We both own high-quality IEMs (Ultimate Ears) but no transmitters or receivers.

\- One of the players is an electric fiddle player that uses processing to manipulate the pitch of their instrument. For this, total isolation works best so they don't hear the acoustic sound of the fiddle. However, a very loud floor monitor works as well we have found as long as it is LOUD.

Concerns I have are:

\- My concerns about the IEMs are just that it adds more complexity and stuff we have to wear and deal with for what are pretty small, intimate gigs. Just using the PA itself for monitoring doesn't work for us for several reasons, the least of which is the pitch issues for the fiddle player mentioned before.

\- I'm worried the IEMs will be too isolating for small gigs

\- They are a PITA to use during practice, but the monitoring situation has to be there during practice.

\- Love that it will handle feedback issues, but pretty sure I can sort that out either way.

I'm just looking to get some advice on what the best way to handle this is. I'm prepared to get a decent wireless rig or some P2s for a wired rig. Not crazy about adding all the tech if I don't have to and since we aren't using clicks and all that stuff I'm worried wireless IEM is just overkill honestly.

The one advantage of the IEMs in my view is just that I think people in general perform much better with a very clear IEM setup. Especially for vocals.",2,1735843349.0,livesound,3,1.0,False

I’m not really sure how to start this. My (32M) and wife (29F) have had some rough patches this past year. Married 3 years, together for 7 years. When we got married, we planned to have kids after a few years. Now that a few years is here, she told me during summer of 2024 she didn’t think she wanted kids and would understand if I wanted to leave. I was shocked, not really sure what to say or think. People change and I don’t fault her for that but it hurt. Can I leave my wife just because she doesn’t want kids? Can I picture myself without her? I’m not sure and it’s not as if our relationship has been perfect. 

I should give some background to our other issues. It’s mainly around me not feeling desired or wanted or not feeling like she’s putting in effort to our relationship.  In the beginning of our relationship she would initiate sex, make me feel wanted, put in effort to our relationship, etc. That hasn’t been the case for maybe 3-4 years. At one point we even got into a schedule that we would be intimate every Sunday. She said this worked better because during the week she’s too stressed from work, too tired, etc. I should mention we both work corporate jobs from home, no kids, no activities consuming us after work, we mainly get off work, cook dinner, maybe play some cards, and then watch TV. The scheduling intimacy hurt and made it feel like a chore but I agreed just hoping for some type of intimacy and connection in that way. Well, the scheduled times are always clunky and don’t feel natural. Eventually, as expected, the schedule didn’t stick and now sometimes we are going 2-4 weeks without any intimacy. If I try to flirt, pull her in for a kiss, etc. I can feel her pulling away from me and giving me the slightest peck of a kiss. This has been going on for a while. Beyond this, I tried explaining to her that intimacy could be just us sitting closer on the couch, snuggling, having good deep conversations, etc. but none of these seem to happen. 

Anyways, back to the kids topic. After she told me this, I said I needed time to process. Still in that process, reading some books, talking to a therapist. But now over the holidays her sister announced she’s pregnant. Now my wife wants to see how the pregnancy goes and how her sister likes being a mom. I get it, pregnancy is scary, can change a women’s body, emotional state, etc. it’s a big deal. But she’s told me she’s considering kids now but I kind of feel hurt? She didn’t want kids before but now she does because her sister is? I just want her to want children because it’s something we both want, not because a sister is doing it. On top of that, she has initiated intimacy with me, probably 3 times in the last 4 years. Every other time is me. It just feels weird she’s even bringing that topic up when it doesn’t appear she actually desires me sexually. 

I don’t know why I’m saying all of this but I feel stuck. I want children but I also want a healthy sex life where we both feel desired in our relationship. 

I’ve brought up our intimacy issues before and it’s met with “guys just want sex more than women”, “I’ll work on it” but never does, “I just don’t like to initiate, I get turned on by touch” but any time I try to flirt or anything it’s met with her pulling away and saying “don’t get any ideas”. Another common response is “I don’t think it would matter to me if we didn’t have sex”. It hurts. I’ve also brought up the lack of “trying” in our relationship. It could be as simple as a birthday card. Hers is always a day or two late for me and my birthday is spent with her family. Meanwhile, I just booked a private party for her birthday with her closest friends, sent her to get a massage, and we went to see her favorite show. All with a surprise note and her favorite breakfast treats waiting for her when she woke up. 

I feel like I meet most of her needs. I’m not lazy, I work out, cook her meals here and there, bring her coffee in the mornings, do the activities she wants to, help her when needed, be there for her emotionally. I’m not perfect but I really try. Whenever something is really important to her or she flat out says “I really want to do this, it’s important to me” I’ll do it. It could be skiing, going on a vacation, going for a hike, reading a book together, I’ll do anything so she’s happy and feels desired. For example, she really enjoys feet massages and massages in general. This used to be a way for her to get the touch she needs to be intimate. Now it just results in her putting her feet on me while watching TV and nudging me with them until I start massaging them. I always massage them, play with her hair, whatever she needs to feel relaxed. But it’s just not met on the other side and it’s taking its toll on me. One of the biggest times this gets to me is when we take big vacations to Europe (her need) and I always agree because I know it’s something she wants. Well, there’s no intimacy on those trips unless I ask and 99% of the time I get a “no”. If you can’t be relaxed enough on vacation, feel taken care of after we spent the day at a beach club, feel connected to me, when will she?

For some more background, we both have similar interests and get along great minus me holding something inside when I don’t feel desired or like she’s putting in effort to our relationship. She’s a great person, we both workout, both like to do outside activities, we’ve got similar hobbies, and all of that. 

I don’t want to divorce but I’m also not happy and nothing ever seems to change. 

tl;dr Husband (32M) doesn’t feel desired or wanted by his (29F) wife. Wife doesn’t want or initiate intimacy, wife decided 3 years into marriage she doesn’t want kids and says it’s ok if I leave. Now she possibly wants kids because her sister is pregnant but she still doesn’t initiate intimacy with husband.

I’ve had great results with IF in the past, it’s helped with weight loss as well as completely stopping chronic indigestion and regular headaches! I eased up on it over the last few months as I’ve been going to the gym and trying to bulk up a bit, but I’m going back into it as I look to cut weight for the summer. I eat between 12:00 and 20:00. 

My question is, would a spoonful of creatine and a multivitamin interrupt my fast? I’d love to make it part of my routine, black coffee and my supplements, just so I don’t forget. With working at the office as well as spending time with the kids on a weekend, I often find myself out and about at midday when I usually take them, and often then just forget to take em. Having them first thing in the morning would negate this, but I don’t want to interrupt the fast and trigger and insulin response.

Anyways, back to the kids topic. After she told me this, I said I needed time to process. Still in that process, reading some books, talking to a therapist. But now over the holidays her sister announced she’s pregnant. Now my wife wants to see how the pregnancy goes and how her sister likes being a mom. I get it, pregnancy is scary, can change a women’s body, emotional state, etc. it’s a big deal. But she’s told me she’s considering kids now but I kind of feel hurt? She didn’t want kids before but now she does because her sister is? I just want her to want children because it’s something we both want, not because a sister is doing it. On top of that, she has initiated intimacy with me, probably 3 times in the last 4 years. Every other time is me. It just feels weird she’s even bringing that topic up when it doesn’t appear she actually desires me sexually. 

I don’t know why I’m saying all of this but I feel stuck. I want children but I also want a healthy sex life where we both feel desired in our relationship. 

I’ve brought up our intimacy issues before and it’s met with “guys just want sex more than women”, “I’ll work on it” but never does, “I just don’t like to initiate, I get turned on by touch” but any time I try to flirt or anything it’s met with her pulling away and saying “don’t get any ideas”. Another common response is “I don’t think it would matter to me if we didn’t have sex”. It hurts. I’ve also brought up the lack of “trying” in our relationship. It could be as simple as a birthday card. Hers is always a day or two late for me and my birthday is spent with her family. Meanwhile, I just booked a private party for her birthday with her closest friends, sent her to get a massage, and we went to see her favorite show. All with a surprise note and her favorite breakfast treats waiting for her when she woke up. 

I feel like I meet most of her needs. I’m not lazy, I work out, cook her meals here and there, bring her coffee in the mornings, do the activities she wants to, help her when needed, be there for her emotionally. I’m not perfect but I really try. Whenever something is really important to her or she flat out says “I really want to do this, it’s important to me” I’ll do it. It could be skiing, going on a vacation, going for a hike, reading a book together, I’ll do anything so she’s happy and feels desired. For example, she really enjoys feet massages and massages in general. This used to be a way for her to get the touch she needs to be intimate. Now it just results in her putting her feet on me while watching TV and nudging me with them until I start massaging them. I always massage them, play with her hair, whatever she needs to feel relaxed. But it’s just not met on the other side and it’s taking its toll on me. One of the biggest times this gets to me is when we take big vacations to Europe (her need) and I always agree because I know it’s something she wants. Well, there’s no intimacy on those trips unless I ask and 99% of the time I get a “no”. If you can’t be relaxed enough on vacation, feel taken care of after we spent the day at a beach club, feel connected to me, when will she?

For some more background, we both have similar interests and get along great minus me holding something inside when I don’t feel desired or like she’s putting in effort to our relationship. She’s a great person, we both workout, both like to do outside activities, we’ve got similar hobbies, and all of that. 

I don’t want to divorce but I’m also not happy and nothing ever seems to change. 

TLDR: Husband (32M) doesn’t feel desired or wanted by his (29F) wife. Wife doesn’t want or initiate intimacy, wife decided 3 years into marriage she doesn’t want kids and says it’s ok if I leave. Now she possibly wants kids because her sister is pregnant but she still doesn’t initiate intimacy with husband.

I just wanted to share my experience because a lot has changed for me over the past few months – especially when it comes to my sleep and my skin.

I used to be a total energy drink addict. In the morning, I’d start with two big cups of coffee, and throughout the day, I’d easily go through 2–3 cans of Red Bull or other energy drinks just to keep going. Sure, they give you a quick boost, but over time, they completely drained me. I couldn’t sleep properly, was constantly tired, and my skin reflected all of that: pale, full of breakouts, and just looked stressed all the time.

At some point, I realized I couldn’t keep going like that. I decided to quit energy drinks completely and cut down on coffee. Instead, I now have a morning drink that gives me a more natural energy boost while also providing nutrients. In the evening, I take something that helps me relax and fall asleep more easily.

The result: I finally sleep through the night, feel more energized during the day – and my skin has improved so much! No more breakouts, and I actually have a fresh, healthy glow again. I never thought cutting out those artificial pick-me-ups would make such a difference.

Has anyone else gone through something similar? Or does anyone have tips for making it easier to transition away from energy drinks?

1hs0o25,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonAgeVeilguard/comments/1hs0o25/finally_completed_veilguard_and_i_took_notes_on/,Finally completed Veilguard! And I took notes on what I noticed with the writing...,"I felt so conflicted during/after the ending of the game, not because of the ending itself (which was pretty well written) but there was a constant feeling of potential in the game that was let down by something Gaider himself called out when he left Bioware years back- that when you don't value your writers, it's all going to fall apart.

Especially in a game series that is so dependent on amazing, complex writing like Dragon Age. 

One thing that bothered me throughout the game was not JUST the use of ""tell, don't show"" overall- but that a lot of times, I actually NEEDED to be told what the hell is going on because the dialogue was so vague and confusing. 

I even wrote down a note about the encounter with Butcher in Treviso- I had no idea what he was talking about or what he meant during that entire conversation, and it was only afterwards when a companion just explained it all in a single background sentence that I finally got it... That part was sad to me because that was such an interesting encounter! Especially in a game that had so little morally grey spots and relied purely on a ""good guys vs bad guys"" dichotomy, it was cool to actually speak with someone we viewed as an enemy and get insight into his motivations, somewhat.

Writing isn't just the writing we see or the dialogue itself, obviously, but that was one of the issues I faced a lot in the game- that there was simultaneously way too much repetitive, obvious dialogue but when it would really matter, the dialogue was lackluster, vague, or just outright confusing in structure to me. 

When there were these huge drops of lore, it would get totally rushed through- and I was left confused with so many unanswered questions that I'd have to look up for an explanation of. Yet we have about 300 conversations about coffee, or superficial expressions of emotions that are resolved within 3 minutes- over and over again...

And that bulldozing over lore drops connects to another gripe I immediately had when I was playing the game- which is that it seemed so little of the world was actually *Dragon Age*. 

It really felt like the game was structured to just be a very basic, bog-standard ""fantasy"" game with elves, dwarves, and tieflings that completely got rid of the institutions and politics that made Dragon Age what it was, and very special within the fantasy genre! This game genuinely felt as if they had erased all of what they had spent 3 entire games creating- FAR MORE than just erasing player choices. It felt like they had erased the world of Thedas itself from Veilguard, relegated only to sudden and un-explored drops of lore thrown like scraps to a dog... 

I do want to say though that Solas' scenes (and all the lore within), Antoine and Evka, and Emmrich- along with Manfred and Assan- were the absolute best things to come out of this game. Those were the only characters to me who felt somewhat fleshed out and well-written, with interesting dialogue and complex stories. And I'm so glad Assan and Manfred weren't ""jar-jar-binks""-ified and made to be slapstick sidekicks- especially Manfred can have such an emotional character arc!!

So that's what reminded me about what Gaider said about Bioware not valuing their writers anymore, and not putting effort into supporting their writers and giving them enough to create the game that it could've/should've been.  I really despise that a lot of the critique of Veilguard is full of superficial gripes with specific scenes or interpretations- when the real issue needs to be Bioware trying to sell a game that had such terrible support for its writers and with a constant changing of teams as they laid off so many foundational people, or forced them to quit!! 

I don't know if corporate overreach and greed can be reversed, but I do think that it would be the only way for Dragon Age to return to form and become the series that was adored for it's complex writing and intricate world design. ",0,1735842731.0,DragonAgeVeilguard,13,0.41,False

1hs0ne6,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1hs0ne6/what_are_some_vegan_ways_to_interact_with_media/,What are some vegan ways to interact with media that may not be strictly vegan and/or related to animal rights? ,"I recently read one of PETA's articles about how to play 'Animal Crossing: New Horizons' while keeping animal rights in mind. Since I became an activist and my transition into veganism, I have been, for example, allowing my virtual characters to follow choices similar to my own in the ""real world."" I have tapered off making and consuming animal products in the game, and if a villager wants a bug or fish, I don't catch one for them, with the exception of giving a scallop to Pascal, and with the exception of the Thanksgiving celebration, which...Having a turkey character express concern about ""real"" Thanksgiving but also eat fish tracks, since turkeys are known to eat fish in the real world. Similarly, even though Harvey is a vegan, I do, on some level, mind that Pascal the Philosopher asks for scallops, uses langauge related to animal products, and hasn't seemed to address what it means to ask for a scallop in a world of anthropomorphized animal characters. I do, on some level, mind that the villagers do not object to having their houses and businesses moved at the whim of the character, even if the character pays for it with the intention of producing a wonderful island for them. I do mind that you can observe octopus villagers seeing their friends in the museum's aquarium. I do mind that we are never told to what care the insects and fish receive, nor do we see another staff member at the museum handling ANYTHING other than Blathers. I do mind that you can give wool sweaters to sheep characters. I do mind that Labelle has never stated her leather jackets with fur collars are vegan. I do mind that we hear about the quarrels the Able Sisters and the Nook Brothers have about their businesses through Katrina. 

And let's address the pigeon milk thing: why is Blathers offering what could be the vomit that pigeons use to feed their young to the player? Why isn't it specified that it could be some sort of plant-based milk? Why are there references to milk in a game where milk-producing mammals are living their lives in what we assume to be a healthy manner? EVEN IF Brewster consents to giving away his ""milk"" to the player, should we TAKE IT??? If we knew the milk was plant-based, that coffee shop would be a huge middle-finger to Starbucks for having that vegan milk upcharge for the longest time. Brewster never charges extra for the milk. At all. He's an independent barista that has made what appears to be an impeccable career out of serving curious museum-goers coffee. 

I guess, what I'm saying is this: how do I continue to consume media that was not produced with potential interpretations of animal rights activism in mind? It does seem like I would lose access to numerous features in this game, as well as many others, if I decided to practice a vegan lifestyle within these games. One of the first ways I was introduced to veganism was through PETA's parody of 'Cooking Mama,' and I had cooked vegan recipes in the original game prior to that. Can I play 'Cooking Mama' if so many dishes contain virtual animal products? 

What about Pokémon? Would Ash really be able to take care of all the Pokémon he caught, if he did catch every Pokémon?

What about Star Wars? What about how the Dagoba swamp creatures are treated? The trash compactor creature? Did the Ewoks have funerals for their deceased the way Luke did for his father? Why is Anakin calming another space creature in the arena not heralded more often as a sign of his inherent goodness? Why don't we talk about what the characters did in that arena scene more? Why did it take the EU and Disney books and TCW for people in-galaxy to discuss, ""Hey, we literally need an army to protect the Republic against attack. Let's clone a bounty hunter! And let's also talk about the ethical implications of that!"" 

What about even classical works? How do we view a poem such as, ""The Raven,"" by Edgar Allan Poe, where the character essentially assails a bird to give him answers to the questions tormenting his mind? The grief that never will go away? Is the fact that a bird IS the symbol of all that we will never control about our lives, as well as the people that pass from them, in itself a terrifying prospect, since we all pass briefly before the stage of the world as birds just fleeting across the sky for a moment before heading into the distance? Is that metaphor even an apt one to make? How do we craft metaphor with animals in mind?

1hs0mxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1hs0mxf/need_to_vent_about_my_mil/,Need to vent about my mil,"To give a little bit of a backstory, my relationship with her was ok before having a baby. She lives out of state so we only had to deal with her a few times a year. I’m an introvert and like to keep to myself. She’s overbearing and loud, likes to be the center of attention so oftentimes, I find her overwhelming. To her I guess my personality comes off as rude since I’m not as engaging and keep the conversations short. When I’m around her, we can never have a quiet moment. She loves to gossip about other family members and she expects me to share my own family gossip with her. She’ll push with questions but I always keep it brief for good reasons. She has shared things about my sil to the family that my sil told her in confidence. Like how my sil took pills to lose weight. Shes not trustworthy. She’s constantly commenting on others weight. Literally everytime she sees me she comments on my weight and how skinny I am which makes me really uncomfortable. I’m naturally a small person and always had trouble gaining weight my whole life. Not that I need to explain that to her. 

The last time she visited, right after she walks in the door she says to me “ did you lose some more weight?” And after she said this, she went on to show us some of the Christmas presents she brought then pulled out this large shirt out of her bag that she said doesn’t fit her anymore but thought it would fit me..

I honestly thinks she’s a narcissist and manipulative. I don’t know what it is about mils after you have a baby but she’s like always trying to undermine me as a parent. Her and fil came to visit when I was 3 days pp and they stayed with us for 4 days. During that time, she was always trying to take the baby away, telling me to go take a take a nap and she would hold him. Never asked to hold my child but would literally say to let her get the baby as she proceeds to take him out of me or my husbands arm. When it would be feeding time, I’d try to take him from her and she would ask me if he really needed to bed fed at the time since he wasn’t crying. If I tried to change my child’s diaper, she’d come in and be like I can do it and take over. Her presence while pp completely changed my outlook on her.

When she came to visit us this Christmas, she came under the pretense that she was here to support us and give us a break with the kids. And of course while she was here, she did several things to undermine me. One of them being telling me to feed my oldest child (who’s not my husbands) ice cream everyday so he can gain weight. He’s naturally skinny and it’s always been in the lower percentile since he was baby. I told her I wouldn’t do that. Not only is it not healthy but he’s already an active child and would be hyper off of the sugar. The next day when she took the kids out to go to a petting zoo, she gave him ice cream as meal. On Christmas Eve, I had plans to go spend time with my family and while we were leaving them, she asked my children if they wanted to come with her while me and my husband went to my family house as a joke. That comment annoyed me but I didn’t say anything to her.

When she left to go home, she sent me a long message about how she felt unwelcomed at my house and that when she visits her other children, their spouses are welcoming. That I didn’t as to so much offer her a cup of coffee while she was here. That I never “appeared” to be grateful for the gifts she gave me and that she hopes we can turn this around. 

She also sent my husband a long message and asked to have a three way call to discuss how she felt with me. I declined it and told my husband to handle her and blocked her. She then went on to tell my husband that I’d be the reason why the kids wouldn’t have a relationship with their grandparents when they have many years of loving to give them.

She had given us a check for Christmas and told my husband to make sure he’s the only one that uses that check. My husband defended me and told her she overstepped her role while she was here and her response to him was that my husband has a right as his mom to defend her. 

I’m to the point where I want no further relationship with this woman. She seems to love drama and I don’t trust her intentions. Thank you for letting me vent ",22,1735842657.0,JUSTNOMIL,25,0.96,False

I would just like to share with you how I get 4 hours of deep work done every single day.

This is what works for me but it might not work for you. I'm just sharing this in hopes you get something good out of it.

Soo, lets get on with it:

**1. Simple to-do list from the night before**  
I start every single day already knowing what I have to do that day. Just look at it and start working.

**2. Coffee**  
I just need coffee to function. No more than three per day and no coffee after 3pm. I need to sleep.

**3. Clear work space**  
I don't have OCD but I need my workspace to be the way I like it. Computer, pen, paper, coffee mug. That's it.

**4. Sleep**  
This one is really simple. Sleep 7-8 hours per night. Go to bed at the same time each night and wake up at the same time each morning. For me it's 10pm - 5.15am.

**5. Take (good) breaks**  
We all know you need to take breaks. And when you do, don't scroll your phone. Go for a walk, excersise, listen to music, read. Just stay off the damn phone.

Yup, that's pretty much it.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.



* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I still remember that time. Perhaps, our first interaction. I was having my usual iced coffee during the first day of class when suddenly, you borrowed my straw to use it as stirrer for your juice. Since then, you have caught my attention.

I paid attention to every detail of you, and I was amazed of how accomplished you were as a person. I mean, who wouldn’t be amazed by you? You look good, you are so smart, and a really talented person. No wonder almost everyone has a crush on you. 

However, you were angry at the world. A little annoyance would make you mad. A little stupidity from your co-workers would drive you insane. You would lash out your anger to everyone, but me.

I have always wondered why whenever I was nearby, you suddenly become soft. I was thinking that perhaps, you like me. 

You noticed I was always alone. You noticed that I would skip meals. You figured out I was lonely. So you talked to me. We shared our personal struggles, we became friends.

I was vulnerable back then, and you making me feel special made me fall for you. I fell really hard.

You allowed me to know you better — your dark past, the melancholic memories that you linger into, your struggle with your auto-immune disease, your sad relationship with your parents — everything.

So our friendship grew deeper even after the 2-week class I had with you. We would chat everyday, would stay up late to audio & video call. I thought we were on the same page.

But we weren’t. While I was falling for you, I didn’t know that you were falling for someone else. Suddenly, you cut all your communication with me. I was left alone, again. I was clueless as to what happened.

It has been 2 years since, but the pain is still here. I would’ve appreciated if you have been honest with me; but no, you cut me off so quick and I have to learn from our mutuals what really happened.

P, I genuinely hope for your happiness, even if that happiness no longer includes me. I hope and pray that you heal from everything you are suffering from, and I hope she takes care of you.

This 2025, I am making a vow to myself that this will be the last time that I will talk about you. I will finally allow myself to heal and move on.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hs0fj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hs0fj6/im_not_sure_i_can_be_friends_with_her_anymore/,I'm not sure I can be friends with her anymore after almost 30 years,"Before I begin, please be kind. I'm not really sure how to navigate this and I'm just doing my best. I've beat myself up enough over things already. 

I first met Kate (name changed) when I was in nursery school. We've been friends ever since (late 20s/30 y/o). I already posted another piece about an initial 'problem' but was completely ripped apart on Reddit so deleted to maintain my sanity (people kept commenting attacking me, I was done).

The initial problem (summarised as fast as possible):

Kate and I are both getting married to our long term partners. Since the beginning (even before planning fully), I've been public about being non traditional, not doing a bridal party and keeping things really simple. I just want everyone to have a nice time, that's basically it. I'm also on an incredibly tight budget so these factors help. Kate, on the other hand, is able to spend more due to family gifting a lot into the budget. She initially wanted to go wedding dress shopping with me and other friends for her gown (this didn't end up happening as she didn't go to a boutique) but you get the idea - I was invited and considered the inner circle. Fast forward a few months and I have a terrible time with my family (illness, deaths etc) which meant I couldn't attend a coffee date. During that, Kate asked the other girls to be her bridesmaids. Given that I was the only member of the group not there, a small part of me assumed that she'd talk to me again when I was feeling up to coming out again. That never happened but I got over it. Until recently. 

Moving to now:

Kate has been treating me weirdly... She talks about wedding stuff that I'm not invited to in front of me (e.g telling the other girls how excited she is to trial make up or pick out bridesmaids dresses for them - in these settings, I've been the literal only person not invited). 

She responds oddly to me about things e.g it was like I'm not supposed to have a bachelorette party just because I don't have a nominated bridal party (I was saying about how I haven't planned it yet but any of my girlfriends are very welcome to enjoy it with me (we might be going away and I didn't want to put financial pressure on specific people - whoever can make it is amazing) - she coldly said that this is why you have bridesmaids to sort it all/come to it). 

She also made friends with someone who ruined my life as a child (hardcore bully, put me in a dangerous situation, destroyed my relationships with others i.e an absolute nightmare of a human) and expects me to be totally normal whenever she's brought up (e.g she asked me if I was friends with her on facebook because did I see this thing etc... I calmly and politely said no but I think my face read as 'why would you ask that').

She's also done other things like give me a sharp look when reaching for more food at the dinner table when we've gone out for a meal at a restaurant (I honestly don't get this, everyone was eating around the table). 

I guess I just feel a little crazy. I feel like she sees me as a lower person than herself. She has a lot in life (family/partner paying for everything, she gave up work a long time ago to pursue hobbies) while I've always pushed on through with whatever I have. A few months ago she also said about how excited she was to start a family, knowing full well that it wasn't exactly very sensitive to those sitting with her at the time (a few people have lost their jobs so cannot fund very wanted additions to their families, one infertile and trying to get answers...). 

She doesn't feel like the person I once knew and it honestly hurts. I know none of this is very dramatic but still, it doesn't feel right for someone who was supposed to be my long term friend. 

What would you do in this situation? I considered talking to her but I feel it would make it worse. Would you continue to maintain the friendship or let it fade? ",1,1735842169.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

So what happens at this meetup?

Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 7 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders -22:30). Currently we are averaging 15-25 people turning up.

Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?

No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.

Can I come along?

Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.

What if I don't want alcohol?

No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.

Since after the above people still asked...

I'm ********* is it OK if I come along?

We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Location/Time: Latymers, W6 8BS / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00

1hs069f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hs069f,"Sanding, Finishing, Wiping","Hello all,

I’m working on my first coffee table and I’m having some unexpected results in the finishing stage.  I’m hoping to get some feedback. 

The top is a kidney bean shape made of bloodwood and I’m using Minwax Tung oil as a finish. 

The top is prepped for finishing (sanded up to 220), and I decided to use some off cuts for test samples. The first test was a fail; there is a milky/cloudy layer on the finish after two coats. I think I know what happened here—it seems the finish didn’t dry properly and some of the chemicals in the finish created the cloudy/milky effect.

For the second attempt, I tried to be more careful about my process. I sanded up to 220, wiped with mineral spirits substitute, wiped a coat of tung oil on, wiped off excess after 5 minutes or so, let it dry for 48 hours. At this point it looked great. Then repeated for the second coat (sanding, wiping, applying, waiting).  This attempt was better, but still slightly cloudy, and overall duller.

Why is the wood looking duller after multiple coats?  Part of me wonders if the mineral spirits substitute is leaving a film behind?  I’m only using it to wipe away sanding dust in between coats. 

To be honest, it looks best after the first coat has dried but before I’ve sanded to prepare the next coat. Should I not sand between coats?

(Ultimately I’d like to apply two coats of tung oil followed by another two coats of tung oil mixed with a small amount of spar urethane.)

Why do more coats seem to make it look duller, or even worse, milkier?
