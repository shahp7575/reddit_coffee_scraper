","So me (24F) and my bf (27M) were coming back from a trip last weekend, and things were already kinda stressful. Our flight was delayed, we were tired, and I just wanted to get home. When we landed, we got our bags and started walking to the parking lot where my car was.

Outta nowhere, he says ‚ÄúHold on, I‚Äôll be right back‚Äù and just walks off without explaining anything. I thought he was going to the bathroom or something, so I waited near the exit. 10 minutes passed. Then 20. I called him like 4 times, no answer. I started freaking out, thinking something happened to him.

Finally, after almost 30 mins, he shows up with a freaking Starbucks cup in his hand and a big smile like everything‚Äôs fine. I was so mad I couldn‚Äôt even talk. I asked why he didn‚Äôt pick up his phone, and he goes, ‚ÄúOh, my bad, it was on silent.‚Äù

At that point, I was done. I told him he could figure out his own ride home and left him there. When I got home, he blew up my phone saying I overreacted and that it was ‚Äújust coffee‚Äù and I should‚Äôve waited.

Now some of my friends are saying I was too harsh, but I feel like if you‚Äôre gonna leave someone waiting in a crowded airport with no explanation, you kinda deserve to find your own way home. AITA?",2,1737000593.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

We‚Äôre currently trying to decide which sofa to buy for our living room and we‚Äôve narrowed down our options to Ektorp 3 seater with a footrest or a Kivik 3 seater with a footrest. My boyfriend wants a Kivik sofa, while I cannot decide between these two because each of them has pros and cons.

Ektorp:
+ pro: higher armrests (which I very much prefer)
+ pro: doesn‚Äôt touch the ground so we could place the automatic vacuum base under it
+ pro: the whole setup would be smaller and there would be more place for fitness activity in the central area of the room 
- con: my bf says it‚Äôs uncomfortable for him
- con: the armrests are rounded and cannot function as additional table-like space for placing a coffee/book/etc.
+- don‚Äôt know what the footrest feels like cause we‚Äôve never had a chance to try it.

Kivik:
+ pro: comfortable for both of us
+ pro: armrests are basically additional tables
+ pro: had a chance to try it at my mom‚Äôs and the footrest is very comfortable also when placed with the longer side next to the sofa so we both could do movie nights sitting comfortably close to each other 
- con: armrests are low, can‚Äôt sit with a pillow comfortably next to it, doesn‚Äôt feel like sitting ‚Äûin a nest‚Äù which I was looking for 
- con: the whole sofa touches the ground so there is no additional space under it 
- con: the whole setup will be bigger and will take up more space.

I‚Äôd love to lean toward the Kivik option because I want my boyfriend to feel comfortable on our new sofa so I‚Äôm looking for ANY tips regarding making the Kivik armrests higher. Is that possible somehow? That would be a complete game changer. With higher armrests I‚Äôd lean to the Kivik option right away. Maybe there are armrests from another sofa from Ikea that fit the Kivik sofa?

Short Devotional about Gratitude

Introduction
------------

Gratitude is a powerful force that transforms our perspective and shapes our reality. It opens our hearts to the myriad blessings that God pours out in our lives each day. In a world that often focuses on what‚Äôs lacking, taking time to give thanks shifts our focus and fills us with joy. Imagine waking up each morning with a heart full of gratitude, ready to embrace the day with a smile and a song.

In this devotional, we are diving into the deep, life-changing practice of giving thanks. Whether it is the beauty of a sunrise, the comfort of a friend‚Äôs presence, or the simple pleasure of a warm cup of coffee, acknowledging God‚Äôs blessings in our daily lives helps us to see His hand in everything. Join me in exploring how cultivating a gratitude-filled mindset can make every moment shine a little brighter.

Bible Verse
-----------

1 Thessalonians 5:18 (NIV): ‚ÄúGive thanks in all circumstances; for this is God‚Äôs will for you in Christ Jesus.‚Äù

Meaning
-------

The verse from 1 Thessalonians encourages us to give thanks not just occasionally or when things are going well, but in all circumstances. This can be a challenging command. Yet, it‚Äôs a call to trust that God is working for our good, even when we can‚Äôt yet see the results. Gratitude is a declaration of faith that God‚Äôs promise of provision, protection, and love remains steadfast.

At its core, gratitude is more than just saying ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù It is an attitude that springs from the understanding of God‚Äôs sovereignty and goodness. When we choose to give thanks amidst trials or triumphs, we align our hearts with God‚Äôs heart, demonstrating our trust in His plans.

Living a life of gratitude helps us see God‚Äôs fingerprints in every facet of our lives. This perspective allows us to rejoice in God‚Äôs present blessings, encouraging us to look forward with hope. Gratitude is a pathway to contentment and peace, harmonizing our desires with God‚Äôs will.

As we embrace the practice of gratitude, we begin to notice more of the beauty and joy in our lives, even in the unforeseen nuisances and troubles. Challenges become opportunities for growth, strengthening our faith and reliance on God.

Actions to Take
---------------

‚Äì Start each day by writing down three things you are thankful for.

‚Äì Express your appreciation to someone who has impacted your life in a positive way.

‚Äì Reflect on a difficult situation in your life and identify at least one thing you learned or gained from it.

‚Äì Set aside time to thank God specifically for His provision and guidance in your life.

‚Äì Make a habit of sending thank-you notes or messages regularly, spreading gratitude around you.

Journal Prompts
---------------

‚Äì What are three things I am grateful for today, and why?

‚Äì How has gratitude changed my perspective during challenging times?

‚Äì In what ways can I incorporate more gratitude into my daily routine?

‚Äì Who in my life can I express my gratitude to this week, and how can I show it?

‚Äì Reflect on a past event where you felt God‚Äôs presence. How can gratitude enhance this memory?

Prayer
------

Dear Heavenly Father,

I thank You for the innumerable blessings You have placed in my life. Please help me cultivate a heart of gratitude, no matter what my circumstances may be. Teach me to see Your hand in every situation and to give thanks for Your goodness and mercy. May my life be a reflection of your love and grace, as I consistently express my appreciation for all You have done. Amen.

Conclusion
----------

As we journey through life‚Äôs ups and downs, let gratitude be the anchor that holds us steady. By focusing on what we have, rather than what we lack, we embrace a perspective shift that enriches our lives in profound ways. Remember that giving thanks is God‚Äôs will for us, a powerful tool to draw us closer to Him and foster a deeper sense of joy and peace.

I originally left private practice because salaries at the junior level were fairly comparable, but within just a short year or two, that‚Äôs all changed. 

Obviously the government pays reasonably well (I make high 6k a month after taxes), but my counter-parts are all eyeing their first homes, whereas I don‚Äôt foresee myself ever buying in Toronto on my paltry government salary. A friend told me how much she makes as an in house lawyer and it made me shed a tear for switching to the government.

I also miss all of the lunches, dinners, work events, etc. We don‚Äôt even get free coffee. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the retreats, sports events, networking events. We don‚Äôt get any of that in the government. 

Sure, I go home at 6pm every night, but frankly I wasn‚Äôt working much more when I was in private practice. And at least when I worked late I got to expense dinner or made up for it in terms of a bonus for meeting my billable target, or a credit for completing the work. Now we work early, late, through lunch, etc. and don‚Äôt get any reward.

The benefits working for the government are truly terrible as well. No health care spending account. Only $30 reimbursement for massages. Can‚Äôt buy a gym membership with it. It seems like it‚Äôs only good if you are chronically ill. For all other uses, it‚Äôs useless. My previous firm had a more generous health care plan.

Is the grass greener? I‚Äôd like to eventually buy a house in Toronto, but that doesn‚Äôt seem possible on a government lawyers salary.

Event examples: go to a bar, hike, ski, climb indoors, group meeting at a bookshop or coffee shop

Some situations examples:

1. In large or very large group chat: Want to go do [activity] tomorrow night? @A @B @C (specific mentions of a small number of people after the invite)
2. Friends start talking about a plan they're going to do while around you. It sounds organized, not hosted. (Note: some folks I know seem to miss the rule not to talk about plans with those not invited even for parties or hosted things so it may be ambiguous if the discussion implies an invite)
3. Acquaintances start talking about a plan they're going to do while around you. It sounds organized, not hosted.


Also, if you're in the process of organizing something informal, like a hike or skiing or going to a bar - say you've got a group text already with a few folks:

I had sex last night and was as gentle as possible. There was some pain but I guess that's expected.

No bleeding afterwards, just some very mild cramping.  

However, this morning I woke up, went to pee and noticed increased clear, watery vaginal discharge.  I am honestly quite scared of incontinence and did my best to check if it was urine or not but was wondering if this increase of discharge is normal the first time having sex after surgery?

This is not just a question of morals or emotional integrity, but one of livelihood. Seattle is becoming more and more financially infeasible for us to work and live in. Your actions at City Council, in addition to your other actions described below, prove to us that you do not care about our livelihoods.
We are the backbone of your stores, and we deserve to be treated as such. Many of our customers have already taken notice of your address to City Council and informed us that they will be taking their business elsewhere‚Äîregardless of what you claim you meant in the address. Your public reputation is becoming one of an owner that mistreats his employees. You and Cherry Street have been named in a number of public forums completely separated from anyone affiliated with the company. The word is out and it is now time to do damage control.
We know you are in a hard position with so much of your staff quitting today, and 3 out of 4 stores closing early. You have already lost an entire store, so we advise you to choose your next moves carefully. That being said: here are our demands moving forward:
We demand an end to sexual harassment. Physical contact with your staff is unacceptable on any terms.  Stop describing us as ‚Äúsexy,‚Äù ‚Äúgood-looking,‚Äù etc. Your inappropriate language and behavior pertaining to our appearance‚Äîincluding but not limited to special attention, comments on our personal romantic/sexual lives, and descriptions of our bodies need to cease. This is not conducive to a safe work environment as it is sexist, inappropriate, and frankly disgusting. This applies to everyone in the company regardless of age or gender. The number of us who are young women emphasize this dynamic. An anti-harassment policy (whether that be an HR department or a concrete 3rd party to address concerns with) needs to be established.
We demand to receive our schedules three weeks in advance. This is fair since we have to provide three weeks notice for time off. We all feel the stress of being unable to plan our lives because of the disruption of your current scheduling procedures. Three-week advanced scheduling will also be beneficial for you as our managers because it prevents callouts and other scheduling conflicts.
We demand that the $1 minimum pay increase you offered us on August 17, 2024 will be permanently reflected in our compensation, NOT just for this pay period. When we receive our raises, the additional dollar amount (eg. $1.25 more than the current minimum wage) stays in effect regardless of any minimum wage increases required by city, state, or federal law. Further, we want a list of employees‚Äô names in writing detailing who will receive which bonus and when. There is confusion on the details, and clarification is needed on a person-to-person basis.
We demand 60 days‚Äô notice if an employee‚Äôs hours are being cut more than 50% AND if an employee‚Äôs hours are cut below full-time/30hrs. You said at the City Council meeting that you will close stores once the tip credit law sunsets in 2025. Our demand for a 60 days‚Äô notice aligns with the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act.
This list is not exhaustive and we have the right to address further workplace concerns with you as they arise.
Your disregard for the wellbeing of your employees does not go unnoticed. We ask for greater transparency regarding your plans for the company and that you  revoke your plans to sacrifice our workers‚Äô wellbeing for your personal gain. We will stand united as we fight for living wages and fair treatment, no matter what it takes.
We are the community you should be prioritizing above all else. We will not stand idly by as your actions threaten our livelihoods. If you are truly as community-oriented as you claim, you will do the right thing and abide by our demands.
Your prompt response to this letter is appreciated‚Äìplease respond by 6pm on Tuesday, August 20th, 2024. If there is anything you would like to discuss regarding this letter, we will schedule a meeting with you ASAP. In this present moment, words are not enough to put our concerned minds at ease. We need concrete agreement to the bullet points written above paired with visible actionable change.

As I sat down with my coffee, this weird kid at the next table asked me if delta was hiring. I figured this poor kid had cancer or something so I told him to put in the work to make his dreams come true. 

He told me that he flew for this airline called ‚Äúaer wishkahnsun.‚Äù now as a professional pilot, I would know if this airline existed and it certainly does not. 

Regardless, I didn‚Äôt want to make the poor kid feel bad, so I let him know that if he was willing to fly internationally then he could probably get hired quickly. Everybody knows that long haul international flying is unpopular because you have to meet the gross people from Europe. 

I told him about the heroic challenges I have to overcome during aerial refueling, but this kid wasn‚Äôt in the mood to listen. I hope that disrespectful kid gets stuck as a rampie until he dies.

There is a sign in the toilet to close the lid before flushing. I finally thought about it and realised it was a good idea. But I haven't been doing it for a very long time and it seems to be very uncommon. Likewise with using a rangehood fan when cooking. When I adopted the habit years ago, I realised how disgusting it was that we cooked while filling up our houses with bad air and often bad smells. I work in a job related to bins, and I notice how little attention members of the public give to proper disposal of waste. For instance, the recycling bin doesn't say coffee cups go in there bu the general waste one does. It's very easy to read but 90% of people ignore it. They also render bins unusable by stuffing as much rubbish as they can into the opening instead of carrying it another 20 metres to the next one.

As I‚Äôve gotten older, I‚Äôve realized how easy it is to lose the closeness we once had with people. Friends move away, life gets busy, and those deep, meaningful connections start to fade. I‚Äôm here hoping to find someone to rebuild that with ‚Äî something real and lasting.

I‚Äôm Carlos, 32, based in Orange County, California. I work a steady job that keeps me busy, but in my downtime, I‚Äôm all about the little things that bring me peace. I love music (I‚Äôm always looking for new playlists), getting lost in a good book, and watching anime to unwind. Coffee is my go-to comfort, whether it‚Äôs a quiet morning cup or a late-night conversation over a fresh brew. Lately, I‚Äôve also found a lot of joy in gardening ‚Äî there‚Äôs something calming about taking care of plants and watching things grow.

What I‚Äôm looking for is simple: genuine connection. Someone who wants to talk about life, passions, dreams, and even the random little things that make us who we are. Whether it‚Äôs deep conversations or lighthearted banter, I‚Äôm here for both. Romance isn‚Äôt necessarily the goal, but if something more grows from a connection, I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed.

If any of this resonates with you, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Let‚Äôs see if we can make this disconnected world feel a little smaller.

Take care.

as you can imagine, today has been hard also. last night i had the worst headache i‚Äôve had possibly ever and it really disrupted my sleep. so when i got up today i just felt like i was the one dying, and i still do. i‚Äôm dealing with a lot of guilt at the moment‚Ä¶i definitely spent enough times with my nan but i still wish i had gone more. mostly i am terrified of the thought of stepping into the care home again and seeing her in the state she‚Äôs in as it DEVASTATED me. she had been in the care home for about four days before i visited and my mom has gone every day and has described to me what it‚Äôs been like and i honestly don‚Äôt know how she isn‚Äôt traumatised and needs therapy for the things she‚Äôs witnessed. she has been inconsolable every single day after getting home so i knew what to expect, but i was still shocked when i saw my nan. she definitely had that certain look about a person when you know they‚Äôre near the end. i didn‚Äôt even last a minute in the room without bursting into tears. i feel really guilty that i couldn‚Äôt even pluck up the courage to say hello to her or hug her, i just kept my distance, looked at her and sobbed and sobbed. she didn‚Äôt really register i was there. she was very dozy, having hallucinations, couldn‚Äôt form proper sentences or even hold a sippy cup of coffee without dropping and spilling it. it was genuinely horrific to witness and the hardest moment of my life to witness and i know that‚Äôs so selfish of me when what she‚Äôs going through and what my moms going through is much worse. anyway.. my point was that i truly don‚Äôt know how i can bear to go again. i know it‚Äôll be the same situation where i just break down. annoyingly, when i cry, i am very loud and because i lose my ability to breathe, i make stupid hiccupy sounds right from my chest that honestly feel like hell. i don‚Äôt want my nan to hear me crying or anyone else to hear me crying. i think i need to visit alone, just sit beside her and hold her hand quietly. i need to hug her and tell her i love her in case i never get the chance again. but i‚Äôm terrified beyond words to go back. i feel like i‚Äôll have a panic attack. i really need advice on how to gain the strength to do it. i know I‚Äôll regret it otherwise, and i know that most people don‚Äôt get the perfect goodbye but i know it‚Äôs approaching faster and faster and i just can‚Äôt lose my opportunity. üíî again i‚Äôm very sorry this is so long to read but i appreciate you if you have. no pressure to leave a comment at all, but if anybody has any advice for me it is most certainly welcomed üíï

also- i have a question that i want some opinions on. it may sound silly. so i turn 20 in a week. for christmas i got a pandora bracelet that ive slowly been adding charms to. for my birthday ive picked out a beautiful June birthstone charm. now, June‚Äôs birthstone is a Pearl. i‚Äôm obviously not born in June‚Ä¶ but June is my nan‚Äôs name. my mom pointed it out that i could perhaps dedicate the charm to her. i honestly really like the idea and i feel comforted by the fact i may have always been carrying my nan with me in some way, because i have always loved pearls. lots of my jewellery has pearls and my keys have a pearl keyring on. this dedication would of course make more sense if my nan was born in June, but she‚Äôs actually not, she‚Äôs born in July haha. but if her NAME is June, and pearls remind me of her now, it‚Äôs not really a dumb thing to do, is it? i‚Äôm not really sureü§ç ",2,1736999168.0,finch,0,1.0,False

Got my act together around 10:30. My friend comes by after talking to the self-proclaimed camp mom telling me she's out of her mind on drugs, talking about he's got to move, and asking what my plan is.

I don't go for that whole 'I'm the leader' thing. Unless you've invited me into your camp and you're looking out for everyone, and being kind. He and I are a solid hundred yards from them.

He splits. I tell him I'll meet up with him later. Yesterday's adventure posted. Get my gear together. Me out of tent. Gear out. Off to get coffee. I stop by this girls camp just to say hi on my way out. Everybody's chilling over there. ""Hey man, did you get that coffee I left in front of your tent."" ""No, didn't see it."" ""Bummer. I left a whole big thing of Folgers instant right outside your door."" ""Aw man that's my favorite. Thanks for the thought though."" Everybody's cool with me. Except this girl. She walks over.

""Hey man, you're gonna have to move your tent."" This bitch is higher than three kites stacked on top of eachother. I'm an ex-tweaker. I know what I'm looking at. ""Why?"" "" 'cause this is our camp and we don't know you. -My friend- said you were only gonna be here 'till Monday. Now it's Wednesday. We don't know you. You gotta move."" She's doing the spun dance the whole time.

""Look. I'm not camping on top of you. I don't see the issue."" ""Well you gotta move. That tent's gotta move somewhere else."" ""This is federal land. I can camp anywhere out here I want. I could see if I were camping next to you or anyone else, but I'm way the fuck over there."" ""Yeah it is federal land. I can't tell you to move but I'm telling you to move."" My brain goes, 'Those two things cancel eachother out. Gotcha!' ""Fine."" I turn around and head out 

'I'm not going anywhere. Fuck her. Stupid bitch. Those guys want to cower down to her that's fine. I'm not afraid of women. I have four younger sisters. Fuck her.' I come out of the woods. Gas station. Coffee pots have water in them. No more coffee today. 'Fuck.'

I wander around the gas station twice looking for coffee drinks. Not a one. Out the door. Down the trail towards the Library.

'I see how this day's going.' Check smokes. Four left. 'I need coffee or this day's gonna be a battle. And I need smokes.' Cut right to family dollar. Grab vanilla coffee. Make my way to front of line. Usual pleasantries. I always ask a cashier how they're doing first. It's a shit job for no money, and they have to put up with everybody's shit when things go wrong. I don't care how busy it is.

I can see they're out of cheap smokes. Coffee scanned. Card slid. Complete lock up of p.o.s. system. 'Yep. That's about right.' I'm prepared for everything to go wrong today. I don't care . I'm not gonna let it get to me. I'm laughing to myself internally. Whole system needs to be reset. ""I was a computer science major in college. You now what I tell people?"" ""What?"" Pour a coke in it."" She laughs. ""It won't fix it but you'll feel better."" Another laugh. Five minutes later system comes back up. Swipe card. It goes through. ""We win again!"" Another laugh. ""Have a good day sir, appreciate ya!"" ""You too, thanks!""

Out the door. Back down trail. Blessed coffee being consumed. Things are coming back around. Grocery store near library. Smokes are a few cents cheaper. Even better. Library.

'I'm gonna sit down on this bench, smoke, and enjoy the rest of this coffee.' Gear down. Smoke lit. Aaaah. Nice! Phone rings.

It's my friend. Stupid phone hangs up on him as I pull it out of my pocket. Call back. ""Hey man, are you still at camp?"" ""No. I'm sitting at the library over by the steps burning one."" ""Where?"" ""Over by where you ran into me yesterday. Oh. Oooh."" I see him. He sees me. We chat about my conversation with tweaker girl. Head inside. Phones charging. Screwing around on Internet.

'Damn. It's 2:00 already? I'm starving!"" Like the junkie that broke into my tent and stole my guitar a couple years ago I'm headed for a fix. I check maps to make sure they're open. I'm walking like I'm late for a date. 'Aaaw yeaah. There open."" Inside. ""Two slices of pepperoni and sausage and a coke please."" ""I'll just put them on the deck for you."" He means oven deck. A few minutes later I have glorious pizza in front of me. I give a quick mental thank you to dude who sent me some money with nothing but a pizza emoji as the message, and dig in. 

It was goooood!!! I went back for a third slice of the same. It's cold out. I'm gonna enjoy this warm meal. A few responses to you wonderful people here while I eat in a nice warm pizza place. So wonderful. Back to library.

Phones plugged in. More screwing around on internet. 'I'm gonna get back on the road tomorrow. Things are starting to go south a little. I know I've been here maybe just a little too long. I don't want to deal with tweaker girl.'

My friend comes over around 5:00ish. ""Hey I just got a call from -one of the dudes- at camp telling me there's a bunch of people pissed off at me."" ""Really."" I know he hasn't done anything wrong. We've been glued to each other for a week. We get up. We leave. We come back. We go to bed.

My friend's reaction is to calm things down when there's tension. Mine is more I'm gonna be very nice and very calm and listen to what you have to say, and try to work it out with you. But if you wanna escalate things... I fight fire with fire. I won't do it until you show that you're determined to go that route, but I'm not really the submissive type.

""Yeah, they're all fucked up out there. Been drinkin' and probably doing drugs all day."" ""If they've messed with my tent. You need to grab your stuff and get out of the woods because I will buy a gas can and go burn that camp to the ground. I don't give fuck who's out there."" He tries to deture from doing so. ""Look. I will do it. I think our best bet is you show me the other way in. You go talk to them. I don't really want any problems tonight. But it will happen."" ""Sounds good to me."" 

We go in through alternate route. He goes to talk to them. One of the dude's comes over to my tent with a flashlight. 

Knife. Blade out. I'm ready. He's the only one I think might be a little work to take in a fight. I still think I'll take him, but you never know...

""Hey man. I don't have any problem with you at all. We're cool. I just want to know what -my friend- told you bout coming out here."" I give him answers that keep my friend and I in good graces. Tell him I'm leaving in the morning. He reiterates that there's no problem with me. He leaves.

'Phew. That went way better than expected.' Friend returns with new tent dropped off by church member and story of things going ok. We chat for a bit, and off to bed.",14,1736999067.0,vagabond,5,0.85,False

1i2g3ru,https://i.redd.it/tv0nhw4r1ade1.jpeg,My review for Aiden and Ode 2,"I wanted to share my experience with the Aiden coffee machine and Ode 2 grinder, both part of the Big Aiden Bundle. Overall, this setup has been a game-changer for my coffee routine!

The Aiden Coffee Machine:
This machine is fantastic‚Äîsuper sleek and functional. It has made my mornings so much smoother, and everything about it screams quality. I got the Big Aiden Bundle for under $300, which feels like a steal. The only downside is that it doesn‚Äôt have a drip stopper, so every time I remove the pot, I end up with some coffee drippings on the base. It‚Äôs a minor inconvenience, but it‚Äôs something to keep in mind. Otherwise, this machine is top-notch, and I highly recommend it.

The Ode 2 Grinder:
I have mixed feelings about the grinder. Given that it‚Äôs $100‚Äì$200 more expensive than the Aiden, I expected better performance. The first unit I received jammed multiple times within the first month, and I had to get it replaced. So far, the replacement unit is working fine, but it‚Äôs still quite loud, and I occasionally worry about it jamming again during certain grind settings. For the price, I hoped for a smoother experience.

The Bundle Deal:
The Big Aiden Bundle is an excellent value for what it includes. Despite the minor frustrations with the grinder and the drip stopper issue, I‚Äôm still very happy with my purchase. It‚Äôs a stylish, efficient addition to my kitchen, and the coffee quality is amazing.

If you‚Äôre considering this bundle, I‚Äôd say go for it! Just keep the potential grinder issues and drip situation in mind. All in all, it‚Äôs been a solid upgrade to my coffee game.",0,1736998974.0,pourover,3,0.4,False
1i2g37d,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoFrance/comments/1i2g37d/discovering_the_street_art_scene_in_paris/,Discovering the street art scene in Paris.,"## Discovering the Street Art Scene in Paris: Beyond the Mona Lisa

Paris. The city of lights, love, and‚Ä¶ street art?  While the Louvre and Eiffel Tower might steal the spotlight, Paris boasts a vibrant and evolving street art scene that's waiting to be discovered. Forget the stuffy museums for a while ‚Äì let's explore the urban canvas!

This isn't your grandma's graffiti.  Parisian street art ranges from intricate murals depicting historical figures to bold, modern abstracts, and everything in between. It‚Äôs a constantly shifting landscape, with new works appearing and disappearing just as quickly.  This ephemeral nature adds to the thrill of the hunt!

**Where to Find the Best Street Art in Paris:**

* **Belleville:** This multicultural neighbourhood is a street artist's playground. Wander its hilly streets and you'll stumble upon breathtaking murals hidden around every corner. Think vibrant colours, bold styles, and a real sense of community spirit woven into the art itself.  It's a great place to start your Parisian street art adventure.

* **Canal Saint-Martin:** This trendy canal area is a hub for creativity, and its walls are no exception.  From smaller, more intimate pieces to large-scale collaborations, the street art along the canal reflects the district's youthful and artistic vibe. Grab a coffee, take a stroll, and soak it all in.

* **M√©nilmontant:** Known for its bohemian atmosphere, M√©nilmontant offers a mix of styles, from politically charged pieces to whimsical illustrations.  The area‚Äôs slightly grittier feel adds to the authenticity of the street art experience.

* **Oberkampf:** This lively district is another hotspot for street art, often featuring works by internationally renowned artists. Its busy streets and dynamic energy create the perfect backdrop for these vibrant creations.

**Tips for Exploring Paris' Street Art:**

* **Wear comfortable shoes:** You'll be doing a lot of walking!
* **Go with a friend or group:**  It‚Äôs safer and more fun.
* **Bring your camera (and a fully charged battery!):** You'll want to capture all the amazing art.
* **Respect the art and the artists:** Don't touch the murals or leave any litter.
* **Check out local guides and walking tours:**  They can help you discover hidden gems and learn more about the artists and their work.
* **Be open to serendipity:** Some of the best discoveries are made unexpectedly.  Just wander and let yourself be surprised!

**Beyond the Locations:**

While specific locations are great starting points, the beauty of street art lies in its unexpected nature.  Keep your eyes peeled as you navigate the city ‚Äì you might just stumble upon a hidden masterpiece on your way to a boulangerie or a charming caf√©.

So, ditch the rigid tourist itinerary for a day and embrace the spontaneous beauty of Parisian street art.  It‚Äôs a vibrant, ever-changing reflection of the city's soul, waiting to be discovered.  Happy hunting!

I met this guy through the dating app Tinder, and I found him to be a bit different. He‚Äôs not great at starting conversations and tends to be a little shy, so our communication was average at first. However, after we added each other on Snapchat, we started sharing our daily moments as streaks and commenting on each other‚Äôs snaps.

After three months of light conversations, he invited me to meet up (I‚Äôm not sure if I should call it a date or just a casual meetup) for coffee. He turned out to be a good man, resembling his personality on the phone, but with a more cheerful side in person. We laughed a lot, and he told me about his job, family, and even his future plans. The meeting lasted two hours, and time flew by. I noticed that he has a grounded and polite personality.

What disappointed me a little is that after the meeting, he didn‚Äôt say anything particularly special about it. Instead, he continued sharing daily snaps as we used to, but now he‚Äôs more open about talking about himself and his life. I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs actually interested in me or just chatting casually. I checked his social media followers and noticed that he doesn‚Äôt have many female friends. He works two jobs and is considering a third one, so he doesn‚Äôt have much free time.

What do you think about this situation?

 note: During the meeting, he was considerate, and it was clear that he‚Äôs shy but tried to break the ice and create a comfortable atmosphere. I live in a place with many traditions and restrictions, so I can‚Äôt meet him often, just to clarify. :)",1,1736998666.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

My whole family are immigrants. Education is *extremely* important to us. I mean, when our parents sacrificed all they had ever known and moved to a foreign country in their 40s with 4 children just so we could have better education and opportunities, it really impacts a kid growing up. We grew up POOR. 

BUT we are super, super fortunate to live in California! 

But I have noticed, especially my coworkers who are my age (I work at a coffee shop and we are 19-30 years old) say allll the fucking time, ""School is stupid you'll just end up in debt."" I mean, were they just surrounded by people who failed in their education growing up???? If school is so stupid then why are my three other siblings making 6 figure salaries straight out of colllege/masters programs in a job that they genuinely enjoy?? And I, too, will be making great money once I have my master's degree. I hate how shallow they sound. My cousins who are back home living in the SLUMS would LOVE to be in your place. Kids my age complain about school and the lack of 'success' it brings- you know what kids in third world countries are complaining about??? What they are going to have for dinner that night! 

I want to slap them around. School is not stupid- you are stupid for believing that you have no control over how it can positively affect your life. Ive even tried telling these idiots ""Go to trade school! School isnt just about writing and reading books, school is wherever you can learn to improve a skill or knowledge on something,"" and they just look at me like fucking idiots who have no clue what I'm talking about. You wanna keep living with your parents and your grandparents for the REST of your life??? I know you fucking don't. 

  
Like, did your parents not teach you the importance of going out there, trying new things, and planning for your future?? If they end up poor and on Welfare one day I don't want to be paying taxes on shit that supports people who failed to plan!

I was sick with allergies and was upset about the same routine.I wake up at 7:00am (sometimes earlier if my mom and stepdad fight) feed my youngest brother (9) breakfast if he hasnt already eaten and drop him off to school. Then come back home and try to rest a bit more and then get back up at 9:30am to drop off my younger brother(19) to school.After that i make myself something to eat before going to work at 12:00.Then come home at 9:30pm,clean my dogs pee pads and let him run out for about an hour. And if im not feeling too tired,make dinner and pick up my younger brother at 11:00pm and finally fall asleep at 11:30pm.

My mom's schedule consists of waking up at 4am, making coffee, and going to work and coming home around 1:30pm, pick up my brothers and she'll either make lunch if shes up to it but a majority of the time buys out and takes my brother (19) to work at 5:00pm, then she'll go to her computer or wind down/ fall asleep the rest of the day.

I expressed my grievances to my grandma a few days ago and she agreed that it sounded like i was being stretched far past my limit and noted the dark circles under my eyes She suggested i spend the night at her house and take a break. I agreed and went home to pick up some clothes and told my youngest brother to tell my mom not to forget to pick up my younger brother and left to my grandmas, took some medicine and passed out around 10pm, woke up the next day at 11am to my grandma telling me what occurred the night before.

My Mom was woken up by my youngest brother about picking up my younger brother and went to pick him up, then questioned where I was and called me and texted me and my brother also called me but when i didnt answer they went to my grandmas and saw my car and my grandma awoke to my mom  angry and still scared. She went on about how i scared her and how she thought i was dead and or missing and was about to call the police. Not too sure what my grandma said but she gave my brother food, and told my mom to let me rest and i'll go back when im better and i need a break. I ended up staying another day.

After that ive been home and just today my mom was able to catch me (i was off today), and yelled about how my grandma invited her to lunch and ""attacked her"" she told my mom to lighten the load on me and how it sounds like ive been more of a parent than she has. (I had NO IDEA my grandma dis this) My mom yelled at me about how im ungrateful and how shes ""so sorry"" that she thought she could rely on me and how she feels tired too and how shes disappointed about the fact im not satisfied with a house, clothes,and food.

It's one of those last straw things. We have a GE microwave where you have to set the clock before you use it after a power failure. That is a ridiculous design. Can you imagine if that was done on the old VCRs that use to flash 12 all the time.

Another dislike is the standard quick time choice on it is 30 seconds. I imagine most microwaves have that. So you put a coffee cup in for 30 seconds and the handle is facing 180 degrees when its done making you have to reach in and around the cup to get it out. Make 30 seconds stop the rotation where it started. Another stupid design.

To introduce myself, I am a middle manager at a coffee roaster in Washington and I am looking to unionize our workplace. I have been around unions before and worked directly with trucking unions and coffee unions for many years now. I believe it‚Äôs time that Seattle collectively organize to unionize one of its most famous industries, to protect it‚Äôs future and take it back from the profit hungry greed of capital from investors and overpaid CEO‚Äôs. 

I know many coffee workers have attempted to unionize within the city and many people have been shut down, stamped out, and fired. Your work has not gone unnoticed and I am hoping your efforts can continue to further the unionization of the field and protect its workers.

Out in public he is not very affectionate even with hand holding but we have great sexual chemistry...when we get together is usually at my asking but this makes sense as I have  kids and a busier schedule so I ask him often but he always travels to me.

Bitcoin BTMs‚Äîthose sleek machines popping up in coffee shops, convenience stores, and bustling city corners‚Äîare the cool kids of the cryptocurrency world. They‚Äôre like ATMs, but way better because they deal in digital gold, not paper money. Now, add the power of QR codes to this equation, and you‚Äôve got a match made in crypto heaven.

Welcome to the future of financial freedom, where Bitcoin BTMs and our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** ([https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)) are the dynamic duo helping you navigate the digital frontier with ease. Let‚Äôs dive into this electrifying combo that‚Äôs reshaping how we buy, sell, and interact with cryptocurrency.

# What‚Äôs a Bitcoin BTM, Anyway?

Imagine an ATM, but instead of spitting out cash, it helps you buy or sell Bitcoin. That‚Äôs a Bitcoin BTM (Bitcoin Teller Machine) in a nutshell. These futuristic kiosks are gateways into the world of cryptocurrency, designed for simplicity and accessibility.

# Why Bitcoin BTMs Rock

1. **Convenience**: With a Bitcoin BTM, you can jump into the crypto world without needing to navigate complex exchanges.
2. **Speed**: Transactions are quick and hassle-free. You‚Äôll be trading Bitcoin faster than it takes to brew your morning coffee.
3. **Privacy**: Many BTMs allow for transactions without extensive KYC processes, giving you a slice of anonymity.

They‚Äôre perfect for everyone‚Äîfrom seasoned Bitcoin enthusiasts to crypto-curious newcomers who want to dip their toes into the blockchain waters.

# Enter the QR Code: The Real MVP

Bitcoin BTMs and QR codes are like peanut butter and jelly‚Äîa perfect pair. QR codes simplify crypto transactions, making the entire process seamless and error-free. Instead of manually typing out a long wallet address (and risking a typo that could send your funds into the void), you just scan a QR code and voil√†!

# Why QR Codes Are Game-Changers

* **Speed**: QR codes are instant. A quick scan and you‚Äôre done.
* **Accuracy**: No more worrying about copying and pasting wallet addresses incorrectly.
* **Simplicity**: They make Bitcoin transactions approachable, even for tech novices.

# How Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App Complements BTMs

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the unsung hero in this story: our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App**. It‚Äôs the tool that makes creating QR codes for Bitcoin transactions ridiculously easy, so you can walk up to any Bitcoin BTM like a pro.

# Key Features of Our App

* **User-Friendly**: You don‚Äôt need to be a blockchain expert to use it.
* **Customizable**: Add colors, logos, or even funky patterns to make your QR code uniquely yours.
* **Secure**: Every QR code generated is safe and built for seamless integration with Bitcoin BTMs.
* **Fast**: Generate a QR code in seconds and get on with your crypto adventure.

Whether you‚Äôre buying Bitcoin at a BTM, paying a friend, or accepting payments for your side hustle, our app has your back.

# How to Use a Bitcoin BTM with a QR Code

Ready to combine the power of BTMs and QR codes? Here‚Äôs how it works:

# Buying Bitcoin

1. **Step Up to the BTM**: Approach the machine with confidence (and maybe a coffee in hand).
2. **Scan Your QR Code**: Open your Bitcoin wallet, generate a receiving QR code, and let the machine scan it.
3. **Insert Cash**: Feed the BTM your hard-earned fiat currency.
4. **Confirm**: Double-check the details, hit confirm, and watch as Bitcoin lands in your wallet.

# Selling Bitcoin

1. **Generate a Sending QR Code**: Use our app to create a QR code with your Bitcoin wallet‚Äôs address.
2. **Scan the BTM**: Let the machine scan your QR code.
3. **Send Bitcoin**: Transfer the specified amount of Bitcoin to the BTM‚Äôs address.
4. **Collect Cash**: Watch the machine dispense cash like it‚Äôs your personal crypto ATM.

# Why Bitcoin BTMs and QR Codes Are Perfect Together

Bitcoin BTMs are revolutionizing how people access cryptocurrency, and QR codes make this process smoother than ever. Together, they eliminate barriers, streamline transactions, and bring crypto into the everyday world.

# Use Cases That Prove the Power of This Combo

1. **Tourism**: Traveling abroad? Bitcoin BTMs let you exchange fiat for Bitcoin or vice versa, while QR codes simplify wallet interactions.
2. **Small Businesses**: Entrepreneurs can accept Bitcoin payments easily by generating QR codes for their wallets.
3. **Crypto Meetups**: Attendees can share wallets via QR codes for seamless Bitcoin transactions.
4. **Emergency Funds**: Need cash quickly? Use a Bitcoin BTM to sell Bitcoin and withdraw fiat in seconds.

# Fun Facts About Bitcoin BTMs

1. **Global Presence**: As of today, there are tens of thousands of Bitcoin BTMs worldwide, and the number keeps growing.
2. **24/7 Access**: Unlike banks, Bitcoin BTMs never close. They‚Äôre there when you need them.
3. **Low Barrier to Entry**: You don‚Äôt need to be a crypto whiz to use one. If you can operate a vending machine, you‚Äôre golden.

# The Future of Bitcoin BTMs and QR Codes

The world of cryptocurrency is evolving rapidly, and Bitcoin BTMs and QR codes are leading the charge. Imagine a future where Bitcoin BTMs are as common as coffee shops, and every business has a QR code for instant crypto payments.

Our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** is at the forefront of this transformation, empowering individuals and businesses to embrace the crypto revolution with style and ease.

Quit cold turkey when my daughter was born and literally never looked back. In fact, the though of dip appalled me after not long at all. Fast forward to fall 2023, 5 years after my last dip. A close buddy of mine offered me a Zyn (cool mint, 3mg). I had seen them floating around before this moment but had 0 interest until this proposal. I thought, heck it‚Äôs just salt and nicotine, let‚Äôs give it a rip. After all, there‚Äôs no tobacco in it so it can‚Äôt be all that bad. Well after I tossed the first one in, it was all that fucking bad. I started chasing that 3mg first-pouch buzz like it was going out of style. Went to the gas station shortly thereafter and went right for the 6mg cool mint. Then it became let‚Äôs try every flavor to see which one really scratched the itch. Well, fact of the matter is, it never got scratched. It turned into a full fledged addiction. Crushing a can and then some a day. Falling asleep with a pouch in. Waking up to spit one out I fell asleep with, only to replace it with a freshy. Zyn, coffee, zyn, workout, zyn, work, zyn, alcohol, zyn, food,
‚Ä¶. Zyn, Zyn, Zyn. I hit the year mark of this bullshit process a few months ago. After spending thousands of dollars, lying to my dentist about new stains I had on my teeth (which I never had before Zyn), and other habits and rituals built around this crap, I Told myself I‚Äôd stop at that one year mark. I didn‚Äôt. In fact I went even harder. Until this last Sunday. I spit out my last pouch and said the fuck with this. I do apologize if you read through this and was looking for a hack or something. I don‚Äôt have that. What I do have is the realization that your inner dialogue is a force to be reckoned with. I became so disgusted with myself and my habit. But I somehow shifted the disgust from myself, to the thing causing the disgust. I don‚Äôt know why that happened or how. I can speculate that when I first tried Zyn I was in a rough patch. It made me feel fantastic for about a half hour. I kept chasing that feeling like a dog chasing its tail. It quickly got to the point of diminishing returns. The thing that made me feel less anxious was making me feel more anxious. Anxiety because of it, anxiety with it, anxiety without it. So really, I think if you can separate yourself from Zyn, or whatever it is, for a period of time beyond what you‚Äôre used to, you‚Äôll find some clarity. Maybe a starting point to build Upon. Zyn isn‚Äôt the only thing that‚Äôs been a hurdle for me. But it‚Äôs going to be a hurdle in my rear view. Fuck Zyn, fuck addiction, fuck anxiety. Let‚Äôs battle this shit together and live lives worth living without this added burden. Here for all of you that read to the end, and even those who didn‚Äôt.

Plus I'm having a rough week and it'd be nice to have something to look forward to. As a forward, I am stupidly picky about everything due to having 1) a very unfortunate intolerance for vanilla and 2) extremely finicky skin/nose combo. I like fruit-forward stuff, cinnamon, wood, weird-but-wearable, and florals.

What I've tried:

- Imaginary Authors: About a fifty-fifty hit rate and my first house. I tore through them over the course of a month and realized I wanted even weirder.

- Fant√¥me: My second indie love, they don't always work for me (the ones that don't work make me physically ill) but the ones that do are wonderful. Shoutout Eos and Lycanthrope. The only issues are that they're expensive and take awhile to ship. 

- Poesie: Something in Poesie's DNA does not jive with me. I've tried two orders full of samples and I've destashed all of them. 

- PULP: My personal holy grail house and perennial source of anxiety. Next to everything works on me, the releases are always directly catered to me somehow, and I have a heart attack every time I read a ""has anyone heard from PULP?"" post. RIP Still Life.

- Morari: First order was full of duds (and Ren Faire, my strawberry candle-y source of joy), second was much better, but I've never been able to commit to Morari fully. Too many misses to make up for the hits.

- Fyrinnae: I've only ordered once, but I deliberately picked out strange ones because I wanted to experiment and certainly got strange. I've been meaning to try again for real because I've heard good things about their mango.

- OSMOFOLIA: The only OSMO frag that ever worked on me is the fucking ham perfume. Everything else has this bitter backing that I don't care for, which is a shame, because I vibe with their names and themes.

- Stone & Wit: Similar to the above, S&W's base doesn't like my skin. Wandering Star is a knockout, though.

- Haus of Gloi: Pretty good, I probably need to order their actual perfume oils instead of just Pumpkin Butters. Though I have been interested in their bubbling scrubs... 

- Alkemia: Damn my skin. Haunted baby powder, every time. My roommate swears by them, and they smell great on her.

- Black-Hearted Tart: I've really only tried one or two. We Fell In Love In October really grew on me after a mediocre first impression and now I love it, but Frou Frou Foxes had it out for me. So I'm anxious to try again. 

- Sorce: My impression of Sorce is Bad, Bad, Not My Thing, The Best Perfume I've Ever Owned, Bad, Bad. Love and Complications really helped set the curve, but I haven't had anything from them that's hit that high again. 

- Hexennacht: I only feel comfortable buying from them through Ajevie. It's a shame, because I've actually had some decent hits in the form of Teenage Dirtbag and Never Was A Cornflake Girl, but I've struck out just as frequently.

- Death & Floral: Of what little I've tried, I loved one in the form of The Scent of Your Skin and Some Foreign Flowers, but everything else fell short for me. 

- The Dead South: When I bought from them through Ajevie, I was a little worried I'd fall in love with a house that had notoriously shaky TAT. I am happy to report that was not the case, and even as a picky weirdo, I've never had a house work less for me.

- Cardinal Scents: CS works amazingly true to its notes and I love that! Literally the only downfall is they only last two hours on me, which breaks my heart and will not stop me from buying again.

- BathSabbath: Another heartbreaker since they're closing, but Cupajoe? Best coffee scent I've ever tried. Smells like coffee ganache.",7,1736997159.0,Indiemakeupandmore,4,1.0,False

4 Steps to Form a Union
When you and your co-workers come together to form a union, you get the right to negotiate with your employer over wages, benefits¬†and working conditions.¬†
No matter what the industry you are in, or the labor law that covers it, the process for forming a union¬†is similar.
1. Get together with your co-workers who may share a common interest in organizing a union.
2. Talk to a union organizer in order to strategize and to learn the next steps.
3. Talk to your co-workers to build support for the union.
4. Show that support through an election or a card-check¬†once you have a strong majority.
Once your union is official, you‚Äôll choose your¬†leaders and negotiate a contract. The process is democratic, and the more inclusive you can be, the stronger your union will be.

Better Pay and Benefits
The union difference is more money in your pockets to buy a home, start a family, pay down student loan debt and save for retirement.
* Union members earn better wages and benefits than workers who aren‚Äôt union members. On average, union workers‚Äô wages are 11.2% higher than their nonunion counterparts.
* Ninety-six percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance, but only 69% of nonunion workers do.
* Unions help bring more working people into the middle class. In fact, in states where people don‚Äôt have union rights, workers‚Äô incomes are lower.

The Union Difference
Workers in a union have:
* higher wages (11.2% more than what nonunion workers make)
* employer-provided health insurance (96% compared to 69%)
* access to paid sick days (93% compared to 75%);
* retirement benefits through private employers (82% to 48%); and
* guaranteed pensions through private employers (54% to 8%).

Vibrant coffee union
The union advantage is even greater for people of color, women, immigrants, and others who have confronted workplace discrimination. A union contract is a potent weapon against unequal pay and structural racism because it establishes fair and transparent systems for hiring and firing, wages and more.
Black, Latino and women workers are paid 26%, 39.2% and 23.8% more, respectively, when they belong to a union. Union contracts pay women and men the same for doing the same job. You cannot be fired for your sexual orientation or gender identity under a union contract.

Wow. Talk about jumping to conclusions without knowing the (any?) facts.

Workers United has filed a petition for an election and we respect the rights of our employees to decide whether or not they want to be represented by Workers United through a secret ballot election. That election will take place on November 1.

According to the MIT living wage calculator, living wage in Philadelphia for one person with no  children is $17.53/hr. The lowest starting wage that we pay is $15/hr. With tips included, the lowest take-home pay that any employee received during the last pay period was $20.51/hr. I take a salary of $52k per year from the business. My partner takes no salary whatsoever. Some of the bakers make more than I do.

All full-time employees receive 80 hours of PTO per year and 50% employer paid health insurance should they choose to join our group plan.

So I vehemently disagree with the idea that we are taking advantage of our employees.

It is absolutely too hot in the bakery. There are HVAC challenges in the historic building that we are operating in, which we were not aware of when we signed the lease. That is a mistake we made. We have been looking for many, many months, actually, years, for a separate bakery production space. The staff is all aware of this. I have looked at several potential spaces. Over the summer, I discussed several of the potential spaces with the bakery staff so they could provide input on how it would affect their commute and how much foot traffic the location might see. We have not found the right space yet.

We are, and always have been, very supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. In 2022, we had custom-made Vibrant Pride mugs made and donated $5 from each purchase to the PHL Pride Collective. In 2023, we did the same but donated to PFLAG Philly.

There is some shared ownership between Vibrant and Function Coffee Labs but they are not the same company. The trans person that was fired from Function was fired for absolutely legitimate business reasons. We absolutely recognize that discrimination against LGBTQ+ people is a major problem, but neither Vibrant nor Function is part of that problem. There are Pride flags displayed in both the Function and Vibrant cafes.

This is all I have to say on the matter.

Really I think I already put it all in the title really.. but if you want to read more dumb details..here you go!

I was asked tonight if I could stop by my SO's mothers work in the morning on my own way to work, & drop off a few bagels, out of a dozen.

(Not sure if it matters, but in her defense, they were only purchased by an Xmas gift-card. not like it was ""real money"" or anything.)

She knows very well don't like this kind of bagel as she's made me try them more than once. (Asiago? 1 think that's the spelling..) - As if I was going to like them the second or third time..so yes, she definitely knows. 

She also knows that l'm likely going to overpay for a plain bagel with cream cheese from Dunkin in the morning with a coffee, on my way to work. (l only work in the office 2x per week, the other 3 days remote.)

AITA for apparently making *her* feel shitty by telling her that it made *me* feel pretty shitty that I never crossed her mind and out of a dozen bagels she couldn't have mixed in couple that I like too.. and basically adding insult to injury, then asking me to drop some off to her mother because she obviously bought too many.... ?  There's literally zero chance she's even going to eat them all before they go stale, and willl probably end up giving the rest to coworkers, if not just  throw them away.

Again.. highly petty.. very stupid... Pretty much just curious I'm the asshole for expressing to her how it made me feel, which made her feel like shit.

Here's an excerpt from my article

A common lie often put forward is that they found child pornography, which is untrue. This lie was proposed due to Thomas Sneddon \[Santa Barbara District Attorney\] motion, which stated that he had a photo of Jonathan Spence nude and a boy with an umbrella wearing bikini bottoms, which isn‚Äôt true.

Now, where did Sneddon get this photo from? He couldn‚Äôt have pulled this photo out of his ass if it didn‚Äôt exist, right? This photo comes from Leroy Thomas (an ex-bodyguard) who joined The Neverland Five. Thomas went to tabloid shows like Hard Copy after receiving 20,000 dollars, where he said that Jackson had a nude photo of a blonde white boy (believed to be Jonathan Spence). Still, when asked by the authorities, he described the photo as a side profile photo of a nude Asian boy with his genitalia covered (believed to be Leroy ""Yoshi"" Levine). Yoshi is the son of Jolie Levine (Jackson‚Äôs assistant). Yoshi, Jolie, and Spence said that Jackson has never acted improperly or inappropriately; both Yoshi and Spence have denied ever taking or letting Jackson take a nude photo of them. Thomas also claims that Jackson forced him to destroy the photo, which he claims that he did. In Jolie's 2017 deposition, she talks about how when she was visited by the authorities, aside from her being misquoted about calling Jackson ‚ÄúChickenhawk‚Äù (a slang term for a pedophile), she brings up how the authorities told her that they had a nude photo of her son Yoshi (even though they didn‚Äôt). When Jolie denied the existence of the photo and asked for the authorities to produce the image, they couldn‚Äôt. In Yoshi's 2017 deposition, he stated that the authorities talked to him without his mother being present or her consent. He stated that they told him that they had nude photos of him that they found at Jacksons‚Äô, which he denied.¬†

When Thomas went on TV and spoke to the authorities, he wasn‚Äôt talking about two different photos; he was talking about the same photo.

If it was true, why wasn‚Äôt Jackson charged with possession of child pornography? because in the simplest terms, both of these photos are child pornography.

Why were these photos not admitted into evidence during the 1993 or 2005 case?

Why in court didn‚Äôt Sneddon introduce the photos?

Why did Thomas not go to the authorities during the time of the alleged incident or after Jackson was accused instead of going to the tabloids?¬†

How could Sneddon and the authorities have these photos or know these photos exist if they were destroyed by Thomas?

Why were these photos only claimed in this motion and not anywhere else?

Why, when asked to produce the photos, could Sneddon not?

Why, during the 2005 trial when the prosecution attempted to prove Spence was being groomed with outside testimony, once that testimony was denied by the judge, why didn‚Äôt the prosecution introduce the photos of Spence as evidence of him getting groomed?¬†

Why have Jonathan Spence and Leroy ‚ÄúYoshi‚Äù Levine denied any allegations that Jackson molested or did any wrongdoing towards him?

Why in the 2005 trial did Sneddon and Jackson's defense team release a statement saying that these photos seized from Neverland were false?    

Something they did find during the raid was Art Photography Books and an abundance of porn both video and magazine

Let‚Äôs get this out of the way Jackson owned an abundance heterosexual porn that was found during both the 93 and 05 raids, they found more than 100 porn magazines, and 3 porn DVDS, On his computers he was logged into multiple porn sites with user names such as¬† ‚ÄúKing 777 tut,‚Äù ‚Äúprivacy 969,‚Äù¬† ‚ÄúMarcel Jackson,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDr. Black,‚Äù much to Jackson‚Äôs dismay a list of all the pornography he owned was released¬†

*Sloppy Dogs Presents: Fuck Me, I‚Äôm a Bad Girl Adult World #2*



it‚Äôs impossible to think Jackson was using this material for anything more than sexual pleasure 

In regards to the art books, 26 Art Photography books were seized out of about 10,000 during both raids, but 2 books have drawn attention over the last 19 years.

Book one was Boy: A Photographic Essay This Art Photography book had some photos of nude children but it was not in a sexual context just had children being children playing, and reading books. Etc the photos of the children in the nude were from the ‚ÄúLord Of The Files‚Äù movie released in 1963, This book was given to Jackson by a fan in 1983 inside of the book there was a message engraved reading¬† ‚ÄúTo Michael: From your fan, ‚ÄúRhonda‚Äù ‚ô• 1983, Chicago‚Äù

To support that Jackson didn‚Äôt use this book for sexual reasons he engraved a message reading ‚ÄúLook at the true spirit of happiness and joy in these boys‚Äô faces. This is the spirit of boyhood, a life I never had and will always dream of. This is the life I want for my children, MJ.""

Book two was In Search of Young Beauty: A Venture Into Photographic Art it contained children dressed being children nothing damning.

Now within isolation, this would be incredibly suspicious, when I got to this part of my research I thought that while Jackson was not a child molester he was a pervert but this thought was disproved when I researched more into what else they seized at Neverland.

They seized the 26 art books I mentioned earlier but they also found his Library of over a million books for history books, art books, autobiographies, children‚Äôs literature, vintage books, and more.

Jackson was keen collector of art, books and movies this claim is substantiated by a quotes by from Jackson‚Äôs Photographer Todd Gray:



*‚ÄúWhen Michael did find time to relax, he loved to leaf through photographic picture books. He would bring his favorite books with him on tour and buy more books while on the road ‚Äì the bus weighted with an increasing number of boxes as we left each city. The Triumph Tour began in Memphis with no boxes; by the time we got to Dallas, a few days later, I noticed two; then came Houston; and by the time we hit San Antonio, I noticed a score of boxes being loaded onto the bus. He especially loved books on Hollywood glamour from the 1930s, richly illustrated children‚Äôs books, and coffee-table books on photography. Michael would usually hole up in the rear of the bus, while the others spent their time together in front. I also preferred the quiet at the back, and I would sit down with him while he was engrossed in a book of Hollywood glamour photographs from the 1930s. Looking at a particularly striking photo, he would say, ‚ÄúThis is magic. They don‚Äôt make photos like this anymore.‚Äù He studied the pose, eyes, make-up, and expression ‚Äì everything that went into a great glamour photo. Michael also loved books that showed children from around the world. One day on the bus I remember him saying ‚ÄúI wish I could write a book about the children of the world. I could go to every country and show how everyone on earth is beautiful. I want to go to India and show the poverty and suffering of the children there, and maybe I could help improve the situation. Africa, too, where there is so much starvation and disease. Todd, would you want to do that with me?‚Äù I was stunned, both because I wondered how Michael would ever find the time and also that he wanted me to be the photographer. I suggested that he take a look at the photographs of Lewis Hine, the influential photojournalist whose work helped spur the introduction of child labor laws in the early twentieth century.‚Äù*

Or Jackson ex-guitarist Jennifer Batten talking about how Jackson used art photography books to design her HIStory tour outfit:¬†

*‚ÄúSomebody had shown Michael an art book that was kind of S&M based and all the paintings looked really beautiful. So he had that in mind but when it came to real life it wasn‚Äôt too beautiful anymore,‚Äù she laughs. ‚ÄúI just had to remind myself that it was all about the theater, you know? It‚Äôs not just about the music.‚Äù*

Or in these two interview of Wesley Snipes and Howard Bloom (Jackson‚Äôs Ex Publicist )¬†

[*Howard Bloom on the Joe Rogan Podcast* ](https://youtu.be/ykP12Q4NEww?si=YWUXqXP7G7L4T0-W&t=128)¬†

[*Wesley Snipes talks about Jackson‚Äôs collections of books ON POWER 1051*¬†¬†](https://youtu.be/PYEXHGmQPlU?si=OnHGE7V21YgZ-Mqh)

Lastly Jackson pointing out art¬†

[*While shopping with Martin Bashir,¬† Jackson point out paintings¬† in the Living with Michael Jackson Documentary*¬†](https://youtu.be/HRnCX-8hA4A?si=L-LDezQQvFaskckR&t=320)

It‚Äôs still possible for Jackson to use these books as pornography, which is true some pedophiles do use Art Photography books, Children‚Äôs television programs, and Magazines. Etc because it‚Äôs legal but they own these Art Photography books, Children‚Äôs television programs, and Magazines. Etc in masses, Jackson only owned two in a collection of 10,000 other art photography books that didn‚Äôt include children, if this was pedophilic he would own hundreds upon thousands of books of children in the nude alongside actual child porn which actual pedophiles do own when they are raided all of this material comes to light, so this theory isn‚Äôt sound when you take into account that the police found 10,000 books in total where the focused there search of Neverland, They found those 2 books in a locked file cabinet most likely with other books (I say most likely because it was the police never mentioned what else was in that cabinet) The only person who had a key to that file cabinet was Blanca Francia(Ex-maid ) who quit in 1991¬†

They had to reach out to the maid who still had the key to the cabinet. If Jackson used these books as porn why didn't he change the lock after Francia left? The two books are in the Library of Congress and are popular and rare photography books. If we would like to have a conversation about Art Photography books of a Sexual nature that Jackson owned such as:

Scenes d‚ÄôInterieur (2000), Alexandre Dupouy (Which included nude or semi-nude women in sexual poses )

The Art of Dave Nestler: Wicked Intentions (2002), Dave Nestler (Which included nude or semi-nude women animated erotically)

POO-chi (2002), Mayumi Lake (This one is funny because it‚Äôs a bunch human armpit photographed to look like Vulvas)

The Gynoids: Genetically Manipulated (2001), Sorayama Hajime (animated female cyborgs in erotic position)

The Christy Report ‚Äì Exploring the Outer Edges of the Sexual Experience (2002), John Quinn (Which included nude or semi-nude women and men in graphic sexual positions and poses some the photos included sadomasochism )

A Sexual Study of Man (1970), Larry Stevens (Which had photos, drawings, and cartoons about homosexuality )

I don‚Äôt know whether Jackson used these books for sexual pleasure but it should be noted that these books had a sexual nature to it.¬†

Majority of¬† the books were found in a cardboard box in Jackson‚Äôs room¬†

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moving into a new home is an exciting adventure, especially when it comes to setting up your kitchen. Every cook knows that having the right tools makes preparing meals easier and more enjoyable. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned chef or just starting out, there are some essential kitchen tools you shouldn't be without. Let's dive into these must-have items that will elevate your cooking experience.

### Knives

A good set of knives is one of the most vital kitchen essentials. You‚Äôll want at least three types: a chef's knife, a paring knife, and a serrated knife. The chef's knife is perfect for slicing, dicing, and chopping vegetables and meats. The paring knife is ideal for tasks like peeling and trimming, while a serrated knife handles breads and delicate pastries.

### Cutting Boards

Protect your countertops and keep your knives sharp with high-quality cutting boards. Consider investing in both plastic and wooden options. Plastic boards are great for raw meats, as they can be easily sanitized, while wooden boards are better for fruits and vegetables, adding a natural touch to your kitchen.

Creative Storage Solutions to Maximize Space in Your Home Kitchen
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Your kitchen is often the heart of your home, but limited space can turn a busy hub into a cluttered mess. Creative storage solutions are essential for maximizing space while keeping your kitchen organized and efficient. Here are clever ideas that will transform your kitchen storage without sacrificing style or functionality.

### Utilize Vertical Space

Don‚Äôt forget to think up! Using vertical space is a smart way to create extra storage areas.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-essentials-for-new-home-kitchen  
  
- **Wall-mounted shelves:** Install shelves above your countertops. They can hold spices, cookbooks, or decorative items.
- **Hanging pot racks:** A pot rack can free up cabinet space while showcasing your beautiful cookware.
- **Over-the-door racks:** Perfect for pantry doors, these racks can store snacks, kitchen tools, or cleaning supplies.

### Drawer Organizers for Clutter Control

Keeping drawers organized can greatly enhance your kitchen usability. Consider these options:

- **Adjustable dividers:** Use adjustable dividers to create sections for utensils, gadgets, and other small items.
- **Tiered organizers:** Help to maximize the height in your drawers with tiered organizers, which allow for easy visibility and access.
- **Mason jars:** Store smaller items like rubber bands, buttons, or baking supplies in mason jars within drawers to reduce clutter.

### Think Outside the Cabinet

Cabinets can quickly fill up, so why not explore other areas?

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-essentials-for-new-home-kitchen  
  
- **Use the back of cabinet doors:** Install hooks or small racks to hold spices, cutting boards, or measuring cups. This keeps them accessible but out of sight.
- **Install a magnetic strip:** A magnetic strip can be installed on the wall or inside a cabinet to hold knives, scissors, or even spice jars with magnetic bases.
- **Under-shelf baskets:** These baskets can slide under existing shelves, providing additional layers of storage for little items.

### Multipurpose Furniture

Furniture that serves more than one purpose is a dream in small kitchens.

- **Kitchen islands:** Look for a kitchen island that includes shelves or cabinets for ample storage, and use it as additional prep space.
- **Storage benches:** Consider a stylish bench for seating that opens up to reveal hidden storage for craft supplies or table linens.
- **Ottomans with storage:** Ottomans can double as seating and storage for platters, cookbooks, or seasonal decor.

### Smart Pantry Organization

A well-organized pantry is key to a functional kitchen. Here‚Äôs how you can keep everything tidy:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-essentials-for-new-home-kitchen  
  
- **Clear containers:** Clear, stackable containers keep food fresh and allow easy visibility of contents.
- **Lazy Susans:** Keep your condiments and spices organized and accessible with a Lazy Susan that allows you to spin for quick access.
- **Baskets:** Use baskets to separate snacks from cooking items. Label each basket for an easy-to-navigate pantry.

### Creative Use of Corners

Don‚Äôt underestimate the corner spaces in your kitchen. They can become valuable storage areas:

- **Corner shelves:** Corner shelving units can hold plants, cookbooks, or decorative items while saving space.
- **Pull-out corner cabinets:** Consider investing in pull-out corner cabinets designed to make use of otherwise wasted space.
- **Tiered plant stands:** If you enjoy some greenery, use tiered stands in corners to grow herbs and small plants.

By utilizing vertical space, keeping drawer items organized, and thinking creatively about furniture and corners, you can transform your kitchen into an inviting and efficient space. Whether you‚Äôre preparing family meals or engaging in fun cooking activities, these storage solutions will ensure that everything has its place, leaving you room to enjoy your culinary adventures.

See I usually like enough chaos that I can control and then I‚Äôm motivated to get a lot of stuff done really quickly. But if you create too much chaos, you can actually overwhelm yourself and then you kind of shut down. And then, then that chaos really becomes a detriment.

So the way to solve that if you‚Äôre ever in that situation is to go into your calendar and just start canceling stuff. Just like you‚Äôre mentally sick, like I don‚Äôt know, something‚Äôs wrong.

Actually our little guy Max he‚Äôs like vomiting, it‚Äôs a disaster right now, I got to help him too. There‚Äôs like some family things you can‚Äôt get off your calendar, you do have to help your family when they have problems. But uhm, you got to get back on the right footing.

Uh and one way I sometimes do this is, I‚Äôll do what I call the midnight burn, where you sleep really well one day you get like 8 hours of sleep, and then you kind of limit coffee during that day on purpose, and then at 9 PM you start drinking like multiple coffees and monsters. Your goal is really to stay up as long as possible until the next morning. And then you know you sleep for like 2 or 4 hours, and then you try to go to sleep around 9 or 10, so like early enough so you can wake up early again the next morning. Because if you go to sleep at 9 and you sleep for 7 hours, you wake up at 4. Or maybe you go to sleep at 10 and you wake up at 5.

That‚Äôs pretty good, that‚Äôs how you can sort of like reset yourself to get back on to a wake up early routine, and sometimes that starts with what I like to call the Daily Wealth Reset.",1,1736996478.0,MeetKevin,1,1.0,False

I looked on the floor asap and saw a fucking roach. I examined it closely and it was dead (it was stuck in the cup, that I was drinking the entire fucking night‚Ä¶) 

My appetite was completely destroyed. I really was planning on getting chipotle but I‚Äôm so skeeved out I‚Äôll be having sleep for dinner. Rule of thumb: leave nothing in your car of value to roaches ever. Absolutely ever. Not even coffee.

1i2f5wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/1i2f5wm/the_armor_building_formula_supplement/,The Armor Building Formula Supplement,"The Armor Building Formula Supplement

I am stunned, and humbled, by the amount of people excited about the Armor Building Formula (ABF). There are a surprising number of forum discussions and it‚Äôs been fun for me to answer various questions and, hopefully, solve some problems. What you have here is the best questions with my best attempts to answer.

Warmups for the Armor Building Formula

My friend, Rick, is a 70-year-old retired police officer, and he was one of my ‚Äúlab rats‚Äù for the Armor Building Formula. He asked a good question about warming up for the ABF and I promised him I would help a bit. 

I thought about this idea, and I came up with this list of items, one through five. I would suggest sticking to the basic order and I am pretty sure the whole warm up will take around five to ten minutes.

One

Do the One Moment Meditation. It‚Äôs an app that is free and I use it daily. If you don‚Äôt want to use an app, you can set your timer for one minute and just go. I asked Rick to count his breaths and this little break in the day settles me down from the news, the commute, or whatever. 

Two

Do the two basic daily mobility movements I suggest for everyone. Straight arm hang from a bar (Child‚Äôs Pose if you can‚Äôt) for thirty seconds and sit at the bottom of the goblet squat for thirty seconds.

Three

Past-Present-Future Journal. Briefly check back over the past few workouts and get a sense of where things have been trending. Don‚Äôt necessarily make a judgement, just see any patterns. Then, review today‚Äôs basic plan. I tend to do about eighty percent of what I plan in a workout: the order changes (I train with other people), issues arise (life still happens), and sometimes the loads and reps are just too hard or too easy and I adjust. Finally, look ahead a few workouts, this really helps me when I am competing, to make sure you are on the path. Now, the ‚Äúpath‚Äù might change as things come up, but are you basically heading in the right direction?

Four

If you know my work, you might know my life compass. These four words are the four points: work, rest, play, pray. Now, ‚Äúpray‚Äù can be alone time, enjoying nature or beauty or art, or whatever cools you down. Meditation is a real gift for me and my concussion issues. Briefly, check in on your current status to see if you are in balance. It‚Äôs a personal thing, but it can be illuminating when you are getting stressed.

Five

I preach the five Fundamental Human Movements: Push, Pull, Hinge, Squat, and Loaded Carries. So, do ONE set of each before you start the ABF workout. I like military press, TRX pulls (all varieties), a deficit deadlift or set of swings, some easy overhead squats with a stick, and a suitcase carry (marching in place if the weather is an issue). Nothing too expansive, but it gets you going.

1-2-3-4-5. It‚Äôs simple and it will cover the basics. 


The Armor Building Complex and the Press Program

In the book, the Armor Building Formula, I have trainees alternate one day of ABCs with one day of high repetition pressing. The formula for pressing is:

2 reps‚Ä¶appropriate rest
3 reps‚Ä¶appropriate rest
5 reps‚Ä¶a bit more rest
10 reps and the round finishes. That‚Äôs 20 reps. 

Five rounds builds up to 100 reps. Whether you use double KB presses or singles is up to you and your equipment. Single bells do take longer, but the load is half. So, as I sadly say too often: it depends. I like pressing in all its forms, so I don‚Äôt mind rotating exercises from week to week and experimenting with chasing fatigue.

One of the issues with the ABF that keeps coming up is loading the high-rep press days. For some people, our ‚Äúborn pressers,‚Äù this isn‚Äôt an issue at all. For others, including several people I work with in my daily work, we have had to make some simple adjustments.

One thing that is difficult in selecting weights for presses or giving advice about what loads to use in any exercise is that we have lots of wonderful human persons lifting weights and they vary in gender, age, experience, genetics, interests, passion, and goals. One size fits all is what a lot of people want to sell you, but a few months in a typical gym will show that there are no formulas to make this work. I wrote the following years ago and I want to share this with you before we move to the basic math.


It is hard for most of us to understand the level of commitment it takes to achieve the highest levels of a sport. In the weightroom, we might need a decade to approach our best lifts. As I covered in my book, Never Let Go, we have four kinds of maximal performances‚Äî
1.    Sorta Max: This is something I can do without any thought or effort. It‚Äôs what most people think they can do.
2.    Max: If someone special shows up while I‚Äôm training or I travel to another place and am spurred on by others or some charismatic coach, this would be my ‚Äúbest.‚Äù
3.    Max Max: This would be what I could if I plotted and planned a performance for at least six months or maybe a year.
4.    Max Max Max: This is that effort that I guarantee has a story behind it. It‚Äôs for a win, a championship, or a lifesaving effort. Most people who hit this level probably doubt that they could repeat it.
 
To help followers of the ABF deal with the Sorta Max to probably Max range, I plugged in Boyd Epley‚Äôs old formula, from 1985, of using reps with a weight to figure out, in a general sense, one‚Äôs one rep max. No formula is perfect and many of us discover this in competition: you might be a lot stronger than you think when you want to win a contest!

This is the formula:
1RM = weight x (1 + (reps / 30))

I would like to thank Brad Pilon for reminding me about this as it really is something to consider.

 

We use this chart in my gym to help pick loads for people who struggle with the fives and tens sets. It‚Äôs not perfect but if you can press the 32 for reps 2-3-5 but flail going higher, drop to the 24 for your ten reps and enjoy. I‚Äôve received some fun feedback from people who are playing around with ‚Äúmax attempts‚Äù with those high rep presses. Pressing big weights for 15 might not be for everyone, but it sure is a fun challenge. 

Remember that: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fun challenge.‚Äù Training should be fun, too. 

One other thing, when KBs first returned to the public eye just after the year 2000 or so, only three sizes were available. I LIKED that as it forced people to train, and learn, with appropriate load for a while before trying to go up heavier. Let me share the numbers if you just have the classic three (16, 24, and 32 kilogram kettlebells).

 

As you can see, you need to handle some serious reps before moving up to test the bigger bell, IF you only have the three originals. And, for the record, I think this is one of the reasons I liked the simplicity of these three. 

As always, seek some challenges in your training. 

The Problem with Giving Advice About Loading the Press Day

If I could sit down with you over a cup of coffee, we could easily, well ‚Äúprobably,‚Äù come up with the appropriate bell for the high rep pressing days. There are always several issues. The first is oddly common. The client tells me:

‚ÄúWell, I only have one bell.‚Äù

That‚Äôs easy: that‚Äôs the bell you press. If you have two bells and both are the same weight, that‚Äôs the bell you press. The more coffee we drink, the more we can discuss options. For some, ‚Äúbuy another bell‚Äù is good advice, but there are always factors. 

If the bell is woefully light and you have some serious press skills, high reps are the answer and it‚Äôs going to be time to experiment with how many reps are appropriate. Cutting back on rest periods is another option and so is playing with other ways to make the press harder (I include more on this later in Question 3 and Question 5, but it can be half-kneeling presses, raising a foot off the ground while pressing, or other press variations). 

Now, if you have multiple bells, you have more options. The follow up question generally is: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do ten reps with the bell on 2-3-5-10, what should I do?‚Äù


A Multi-Bell Approach to Variety‚Ä¶and Sticking Points

The answer to the ten-rep question, or if you just want some variety (or an idea for the next round of ABF), many have found that a matrix of reducing loads and increasing reps is fun, challenging, and appropriate to progress.

For example, you struggle with five reps with the 24, but you can get doubles with the 28. Try this:

2 x 28 kg
3 x 24 kg
5 x 20 kg
10 x 16 kg

As the weeks progress, slide that triple to the 28 and do fives with the 24. You can either keep the tens at the 16 or move up to the 20 but err on getting those heavy doubles and triples before chasing the loads on the ten. 

The rep charts seen above can also be used to play with some different rep schemes on your high rep pressing days. If ‚Äúout of nowhere‚Äù a load feels really challenging, try going light with more reps. With our charts, you can see that if the 24k bell is giving you fits, sets of ten with the 20k is, according to the charts, the same. If you are flailing with the 24k on the 2-3-5-10, try the 20k for today and get two sets of ten. 

Sometimes, small changes like this example do more for the body, mind, soul, and spirit of the lifter than radical, sweeping changes. Moreover, reducing load and increasing reps can lead to more hypertrophy and provides an injection of enthusiasm for the next training session.


Questions and Answers

Q1. ‚ÄúIs it okay to add mobility days?‚Äù

A. Absolutely! At my gym, Thursday is Tonic Day and we do about an hour of Original Strength, specific wrist/finger and ankle/foot/toe mobility and extra work on stability stuff (the birddog family and some other simple things). We also do some hip flexor and hamstring work as that is just a pretty common problem with just about everybody for just about every reason I can think. 

I would say a daily walk is a given. For 19 out of 20 people, simply walking will push the dial towards better mobility (as I type this, I see that it is in the name: ""Mobile-ity""). I do hope you walk on ABF for body comp and mobility reasons. It's practically stealing for many people: so much progress for such a small investment. 

I also have some follow along videos on YouTube. They are not great like some people make them, but they are real. I don't know if the one is still up where I do 55 egg rolls but that would be my personal ""Do This"" that might fit your needs. 

Q2. ‚ÄúI can only press my KB seven times. How am I supposed to do ten reps on the press days?

A. When I wrote the ABF, the biggest concern from the readers was almost always one of the great strengths, and weaknesses, of KBs: these tools are hard to microload. They just are. Some internet user only uses a 22 kg bell. It's hard to find a 22 at certs! So, if all you have is a bell you can only press for 7, your example and that is a pretty good number of reps for the 24/32 user, you must back off to the 2-3-5-2-3-5. 

And that's fine. 

If those five reps are too much, try 2-3-2-3-2-3 and build up to the fives over time.

Q3. ‚ÄúIf finished the ABF and I want to do it again. Any suggestions?‚Äù

A. Yes, first, take a week or two off and try something a little different. On my YouTube channel, I have a fun single bell workout I call the Perfect Workout‚Ä¶which, of course, is a bit of hyperbole. Three days a week:

Three rounds of the following:
Half Kneeling Press, left knee down/left hand press x 8
Half Kneeling Press, right knee down/right hand press x 8
30 seconds of hanging for the bar (or Child‚Äôs Pose from yoga)

Goblet Squat to Overhead Squat (stick) drill x 8 (I suggest just one set at first‚Ä¶this is weirdly exhausting at first)

Swings, five sets of 15
(Or hip thrust variations as appropriate)

Suitcase carry, both hands. (One big round trip)

Walk!

The Perfect Workout just feels good and does some nice mobility work. There are countless other kettlebell programs that can be a nice change up after ABF.

Obviously, as you go through the ABF the second time, the easiest way to improve is to use heavier bells in the ABC and the press days. 

If you wish, or only have access to the same load, a fun variation, and this option is really harder than it seems, is to clean EVERY rep on the press day. So, the double would be:

Clean and press, clean and press. (On the standard ABF, we would go clean and press then press again)

If you wish to continue to progress with this one single bell, you might try other pressing variations. I include this from the Easy Strength Omnibook with editing for clarity.

In this example, I assume pressing with the left hand‚Ä¶it will make sense in a moment. These movements go from easiest to hardest. 

Floor press
Press standing on both feet
Half-kneeling press (left knee down)
Half-kneeling press (right knee down)
Press standing on the right foot
Press standing on the left foot
Waiter‚Äôs Press
Waiter‚Äôs press standing on the right foot
Waiter‚Äôs press standing on the left foot
Bottom-up press
Bottom-up press standing on the right foot
Bottom-up press standing on the left foot

One can certainly do the waiter‚Äôs and bottom-up pressing in the half-kneeling position. Use caution‚Ä¶a lot‚Ä¶doing the floor press with the bottom-up or waiter‚Äôs press. I‚Äôm not sure I recommend these options (bottom-up and waiter press from the floor). Enjoy your teeth!

Q4. ‚ÄúIn the barbell section, you tell us to do 16-20 reps. Is that a total of 16-20 reps?‚Äù

A. Sorry, no. Those are SETS of 16-20 reps. The hypertrophy range is interesting as the rep ranges that work best for each SET works out to:

8-12 reps per set
16-20 reps per set

Now, there is nothing wrong (or really right‚Ä¶no moral theology here) about 13-15 reps and you can get some serious lean body mass with just singles, doubles, and triples. The ABF formulas have plenty of grinding hard reps, so this Wednesday workout can be refreshing. 

I have lots of older bodybuilding books (anything older than me is, by my definition, older) that list all kinds of ‚Äúlost variations‚Äù that make for fun sets of 16-20.

Jefferson Deadlifts
Hack Squats
Good Mornings 
Presses of all kinds
Squats, including the Zercher variation
Deadlift and Shrug
Sidebends, including the Saxon Sidebend
Curls of all kinds (and there are probably more curl variations than any other lift0
Triceps extensions and all the variations
Sisyphus Squats (aka ‚ÄúSissy Squats‚Äù)
And‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sure the list can go on. 

Feeling the ‚Äúburn‚Äù during a set of deadlift variations in the thighs certainly taught me that I have underappreciated higher reps for a few decades. 

Utilizing the chart from the KB pressing programs, you can see that higher reps can lead to increased strength, too. Using Boyd Epley‚Äôs numbers, and thanks again to Brad Pilon, you can see that, at least according to the charts, lighter weights with high reps can translate into some nice lifts.

Q5. ‚ÄúDan, can I do Easy Strength with the ABC?‚Äù

First, I need to make sure you read this right: the Armor Building Formula is presses and ABCs. 

The ABC is a complex with Kettlebells‚Ä¶and it is brilliant.

 I answer this question in the book with the barbell program, and here you go:

Don‚Äôt overthink it. Programs One and Two are excellent programs with the basics of ES. I would argue that you choose wisely on the ES lifts here. I think you have two options:

Horizontal Press
Deadlift variation

Personally, I would prefer you incline bench press unless you have a good spotter that you can trust every session for regular bench press. If your shoulders can handle it, dips are a good suggestion, too. So, there you go: inclines, bench press or dip. For deadlifts, I would suggest rack deadlifts (bar set at either just above or just below the knee) or a deadlift variation that you can do a lot of volume with each week. 

As always, keep the Easy Strength reps at ten or less total reps. So:

Five sets of two
Two sets of five
Three sets of three

Read my other works for every variation, but I suggest you do what I originally did when I used ES to prep my best years as a discus thrower and Highland Games athlete: stick with two sets of five. Start lighter than you think, never fail, and add load when you perceive that the current load is too easy. Every few weeks, maybe months, try a heavy double to see if you have improved. 

For simplicity‚Äôs sake, let‚Äôs give you the basics:

Warm up
	Hang for thirty seconds
	Sit at the bottom of the goblet squat for thirty seconds
	Move around until you feel warm enough to get going

Easy Strength
	Two sets of five in the incline bench press
	Two sets of five in the rack deadlift
If the loads feel light, go heavier next time. 

Program Two
(All for eights)
Clean and press
Curl
Clean and press
Curl
Clean and press
Curl 
Clean and press
Curl
Clean and press
Curl

One loop of suitcase carries.
Ab wheel for one set of ten, if you wish.

Generally, I like to do Easy Strength five days a week. But, with this program just do three days a week following the Program Two recommendations. If you like to train on weekends, the Monday-Wednesday-Saturday option seems ‚Äúbest.‚Äù As always, your mileage may vary so adapt as you need to adapt.

If you have more time on one day, perhaps Saturday, use Program One for the continuous clean and press and curls. Progression in both the Easy Strength protocol and Programs One and Two is slow and steady. I explained the Tortoise and the Hare in Easy Strength, but in all areas of lifting (and life) ‚Äúslow and steady gets the job done.‚Äù
End quote.

This question is more common than one would think. Getting kettlebells to work with Easy Strength is not easy. Yes, I CAN give you a program, but it is difficult.  In my Easy Strength Omnibook, I addressed KBs with Easy Strength and here you go:

Can I Use Kettlebells with Easy Strength?

The German language has a term that helps me understand questions about Easy Strength: ameisent√§towierer or ‚Äúant tattooist."" It‚Äôs that narrow vision of the world (stodgy! pedantic!) where everything must be written out and carved in stone.

Easy Strength is not for ant tattooists. Now, I‚Äôm sure those of you tattoo ants are kind, loving, hard-working members of society. I wrote Even Easier Strength for you, and I‚Äôve been informed, time and again, that there still is a lack of clarity. 

When we get into Easy Strength WITH kettlebells, I nicely must ask the ant tattoo society to stop reading and find square pegs to smash into round holes. Honestly, answering specific questions on ES4KBs will cause me to smash my round head into the square wall. 
Kettlebells are great. I was first in line when Pavel and John Ducane reintroduced them to all of us and I continue to believe that if I was forced to train for the rest of my life with a single kettlebell (some weird alien invasion dictatorship decision), I could make progress in every quality of human performance. 

Swing, snatch, press, squat, get up, and clean. It‚Äôs a simple list and the options of positions, reps, and intensity could, and will, do marvels for you.

ES4KBs popped up during the Covid quarantines. As is always the case, the first question seems obvious:

How many kettlebells do you have?

If it‚Äôs one, I can probably come up with some ideas about changing positions for each of the basic moves to find harder and easier variations. Let‚Äôs just use the press, from harder to easier.

(Note: I used this above answering the loading question, but the lifts are in a different order. Please recognize the difference.)

We‚Äôll assume pressing with the left hand‚Ä¶it will make sense in a moment.
‚Ä¢	Bottom-up press standing on the left foot
‚Ä¢	Bottom-up press standing on the right foot
‚Ä¢	Waiter‚Äôs press standing on the left foot
‚Ä¢	Waiter‚Äôs press standing on the right foot
‚Ä¢	Press standing on the left foot
‚Ä¢	Press standing on the right foot
For simplicity, just assume this order: bottom-up, waiter‚Äôs press, press.
‚Ä¢	Press standing on both feet
‚Ä¢	Half-kneeling press (left knee down)
‚Ä¢	Half-kneeling press (right knee down)
‚Ä¢	Floor press (watch your teeth with bottom-up and waiter‚Äôs variations)

On easy days, the floor press with that one bell should be easy. On the hardest of hard days, a few reps balancing on one foot with the bell bottom-up is going to be, hmmmmm, hard.

If you have the traditional three bells‚Äîthat is, a 16, 24, and 32‚Äîyou have a lot of options if you mix and match movements with the options and make hard HARD and easy, well, easy.
Find an ant. Tattoo ‚Äúthe devil is in the details‚Äù on its butt‚Ä¶or whatever you call an ant‚Äôs rear end.

The kettlebell deadlift is probably not going to be ‚Äúhard‚Äù for most people after a few weeks. 
The single-leg deadlift will be hard for me with the lightest of loads (I get a bit exposed physically when on one leg). So, as you see kettlebells deadlift in the program, you need to think of hinge variations. Putting my toes on a board and doing kettlebells deadlifts more like a Romanian deadlift is easy for me‚Ä¶until tomorrow morning when my hamstrings are screaming. 

In the following program, we use chin ups as our pull. Certainly, some readers can do 50 chin ups while eating a sandwich. Other can‚Äôt do a single. We found that for many people, hanging is just as good as failing at poor chin ups. 

The squat is a wonderful movement, but many will find a single bell too light. I often use a three-minute drill as a variation. At the top and bottom of every minute (the 12 o‚Äôclock and the 6 o‚Äôclock on my Little Mermaid wall clock), simply do a goblet squat. Squat back down and ‚Äúrest‚Äù for the next 30 seconds. 

If that‚Äôs too easy, do the actual test for six minutes. If that‚Äôs too easy, good for you!
Anne Reuss uses jumping goblet squats for her single-bell squatting. Certainly, the fact that she competed on American Ninja might be a factor in why she does this variation, but if you can do a six-minute drill and still get air with jumping goblets, maybe you‚Äôre doing just fine.

So, can you use kettlebells for Easy Strength? Sure. Like all tools, we must adapt in some situations, but the feedback I receive about kettlebells and Easy Strength is universally good. Adaption, of course, is the key to improving human performance.
End quote. 

Note well, that the ABC covers some of the basic human movements. I list the basic human movements as:

Push
Pull
Hinge
Squat
Loaded Carry
The Sixth Movement (anything you want to do, usually groundwork and brachiating, that are part of a good program)

The ABC covers the push fairly well, the hinge (the double clean is a hinge) better, and the squat is more than enough. As an aside, I usually don‚Äôt include squats in ES because of the issues covered in three chapters of the Easy Strength Omnibook.

If you add some hangs, monkey bars, chin ups, pull ups, rows of all varieties, or any other pulling motion that I may have missed, you can easily make ABC an ES program. Toss in some suitcase carries, waiter walks, or rack walks and you cover the bases of single KB work. With doubles, I love farmer walks. 

The devil. Is. In. The. Details. If you choose to do the ABC five days a week, I think five to ten rounds a day is enough (understatement of the day). Two sets of five in a controlled pull and some fun variations and challenges in the loaded carry can keep you training for a long time.  If you train three days a week, you can extend one ABC workout to fifteen to thirty rounds, another workout, the easy day, stays in that five to ten round range, and the medium workout can be from ten to twenty rounds.

General Warmup

Two sets of Five in the Pull
ABC for rounds
Suitcase carry
Ab wheel (or variation) for one set of ten

It‚Äôs repeatable, logical, and doable. It is a LOT of squats. Take your time building up volume on this program and refer to the Omnibook for any questions or issues.

Q6. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm begging you, please don‚Äôt let me think. On the barbell ABF Program Three, you tell us to do basically whatever we want but keep the reps in the 16-20 range. I understand that this is the reps per exercise (16-20) not a total number or reps. Please. Give me some examples.‚Äù

Okay then, join me in my back porch in my hometown of South San Francisco during the height of Watergate and OPEC gas crisis. In our foggy evening, we are going to roll out our Sears Ted Williams 110-pound set (50 kilos) and get an ‚Äúold school‚Äù workout in. 

Back then, I had outgrown my bar and plates and started experimenting with higher reps. It was, and remains, a GREAT idea to push the reps up every so often. My first example is our famous Bunz and Gunz:

2-4 Rounds 
a.	Hip Thrust 
b.	Goblet Squat 
c.	Deficit Dead/Swing 
d.	Ab Wheel/Hanging Bent Knee Raise

3-5 Rounds
a.	Curls
b.	Triceps Extensions

With the high reps, 16-20, you might need to adjust load as‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a LOT of reps!!!

Honestly, that might be a great supplement to the barbell ABF program. Let me give you some more ideas.

I always lean into Harry Paschall and his pupil, Bosco, when it comes to fun programming ideas. This is an adaption of one his strength and bodybuilding programs. Start off with one set of 16-20 then add a set or two over the next few weeks.


    Squat with bar held overhead (Today, we just say ‚Äúoverhead squats)
    Heavy two-hand curl
    Bosco Deadlift and Shrug (Squeeze your scaps together and do DLs followed by a shrug)
    Press on Incline Bench
    Triceps exercise 
    Back Squats
    Upright Rows

Paschall had great success with one of his pupils just doing one set of higher reps with just 125 pounds. High reps work, of course, and simply changing to 16-20 reps might shake things up with you. Here was the full program:

1.) Breathing Squat ‚Äì 15-20 reps. 
2.) Pullover ‚Äì 15-20 reps.
3.) Press on Bench ‚Äì 8-12 reps. (Today, we would say ‚Äúbench press‚Äù)
4.) Breathing Squat ‚Äì 15-20 reps.
5.) Pullover ‚Äì 15-20 reps.
6.) Curl ‚Äì 8-12 reps.
7.) Breathing Squat ‚Äì 15-20 reps.
8.) Bent Arm Pullover ‚Äì 8-12 reps.

Just use these as ideas. The breathing squat and pullover idea was still very popular when I first started lifting. This program is just one set of each of the eight exercises, but it might give you some fun ideas about what to do with your program.

Headaches subsided. Yesterday I slept very well without cold medicine, which I had been taking after a few unpleasant nights. 

I feel more present in the moment, anxiety went down. Even skin looks happier. And most importantly- I completely do not want caffeine anymore! If I would be choosing the drug, I would rather choose relaxant over stimulant as I am naturally quite high strung. 

However one thing is down: my HRV. And my stress levels are higher. I wear Apple Watch and monitor health parameters. This doesn‚Äôt make any sense! Why would stress be increased if I feel calmer? I do not feel any serious withdrawal as my headaches are gone. 

So today was a stressful day. Twice I had extremely stressed communication with my husband where I yelled (I hardly ever yell) and smashed by facial care essence bottle at the table, so it shattered. At work it was go-go-go, complex calculations, back-to-back meetings where I had to present, arising problems that had to be squeezed in between, emotional conversation with my mother, squeezed in 18 minutes, where my mother outlined again that she is dependent on me. Just exactly what I needed to hear. Then 11 minutes food intake and more working sessions, discussions, decisions, writings, and more meetings. After I came home I had another mild yelling session with my husband. And then I finally looked at my health tracker and to my utmost surprise I saw that during all that my HRV increased!!! 

And then I understood that this is compensation for coffee stress! I thought I was doing myself in but instead I was healing. lol

Now I suspect that my stressed reaction to life is a compensatory mechanism due to absence of coffee stress. I obviously seek my comfort levels of stress!

Most of my friends from college moved to universities across the country and whilst we have no bad blood, we have like grown apart and just don‚Äôt really keep up with each other and just follow each other on socials.

I did message one from a story they posted as an icebreaker but they left me on delivered after a few lines. The only friends I seem to get are very toxic, well friends that are more like in depth or less surface level. I met a girl on freshers and she just used me as her punching bag and blamed it all on her autism. She was genuinely vile to me and would put me down to lift herself up or I have met a few girls who have attempted to befriend me but they just talk badly about the friends they have and I‚Äôm like that‚Äôs a red flag, so I distance myself. I find it super hard to make connections that aren‚Äôt just surface level, unless it‚Äôs with someone who is toxic and looking for an easy target. I don‚Äôt know why I found it so easier and people seemed more interested in casual conversation back in college or like going for a coffee.

Back when this Sears had a very robust inventory and carried every single big name brand of shoes and apparel on the first floor and half of the second floor (Kids Apparel) where they also had housewares, furniture, bed and bath products and mattresses as well, and on the third floor they had electronics, appliances, vacuum cleaners, hardware, fitness, grills and patio furniture. This was the case until 2021 and they have since downsized. 3rd floor was closed in April 2021, and by August 2021, so did the big name clothing brands disappear. They had 2 floors but was since very quickly liquidating this store which they got a months notice and did a very quick month liquidation. This place was nearly identical to the original Sears in the Greater Seattle Area and the City of Seattle on Lander Street. This location, as seen in the photos and from what I remember, had compact fluorescent light bulbs aka CFLs used in recessed cans on the first floor.    

2006 was my very first year here from my childhood. We Still have the Kenmore coffee maker we bought from this Sears and Roebuck department store sometime in the 2010s decade and it is still working. 

This very last location in my home state of Washington has since shut down last month. This was my other childhood Sears after we went to the one in Shoreline (first time was in 2000/01) that closed on April 8 2018. The original location in Seattle at the Starbucks Center was also my childhood Sears as well, which I remember going to and that store closed on June 1 2014. As of December 15 2024, Burbank and Whittier in California are now the very last 3 level Sears locations on the West Coast of the United States of America. 

Taken by Flickr user Deven (tequilaanddonuts) aka / also known as Tequila and Donuts on June 10 2007 

Built 1968, converted to Sears in 1994, used to be another department store we just mentioned that closed up shop in 1992

Since today marks a month since this location closed   I figured this would be the best time for these old photos  ",14,1736995380.0,SEARS,1,1.0,False

Major one - beside my apartment, there is a vacant plot, until COVID, people parked cars there, during lockdown, cars vanished, it became filled up with bushes, still it‚Äôs good, one day, municipality workers cleaned the land, post that, it became a littering ground cum open toilet. Once in a blue moon municipality used to bring its bulldozers to clean the spot. In 2022, they built a Ward office just 50m away from my apt, while mayor and the local MP came, they covered the area with a white cloth!! As I stay in 1st floor, it affected me the most, so I started complaining, started visiting the Ward office complaining at the KMC workers, counsellors, nothing happened, apart from just cleaning, I escalated the matter to Borough office, KMC health worker came and gave his contact and rather scolded me as apparently my apt owners are also adding to the heap. Now seeing everything out of control my father complained to the CMO grievance cell, well matter escalated soon, the same KMC worker came running to give attendance saying, you complained at xyz time and we came within 10 mins, we are cleaning and miking pls give good feedback, post that the cleaning became on 15 day frequency! But very recently he also gave up saying, amader hathe ar kichu nei, eta pvt land, owner ke bolun, amra roz poriskar krte parbo, we started urging people to not litter here, we literally took pictures and asked them to take back there garbage else we would give it to KMC for penalty and all! After all the effort, the land became clean, but again some folks dropped huge heap of garbage, don‚Äôt know how to stop, in between our guard got threats at midnight from some goons post which he left job!! 
Another case, today in the airport waiting area, saw few passengers just openly throwing biscuit packets, coffee cups on the floor, while I politely requested them to pls use the dustbin instead they became really aggressive, saying apka kya jata h!! Jante hai hum kaun hai!! I backed out!

1i2eq3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1i2eq3o/how_to_get_out_of_a_lease_with_an_unstable/,How to get out of a lease with an unstable roommate,"


My roommate has become increasingly unstable. I can‚Äôt do anything in the apartment without her screaming at me and telling me how horrible I am. We have a few more months on the lease but at this point I‚Äôm desperate to get out and I do worry that she is unstable enough to mess with my food and toiletries. 

A few nights ago I put a pot in the sink while I put my dinner down in my room. She immediately started screaming how disgusting I was to leave a dish in the sink even though I had turned back around to clean it. 

I leave 3 strands of hair in the shower on accident, I‚Äôm texted a paragraph about how dirty I am or she just screams. 

She is destroying my furniture and I believe on purpose. But not enough to warrant full damage. She shoved my dining table so hard the legs wobbled and the back of a chair had a small gash in it from the chair hitting a corner. I discovered my coffee table covered in glue and rings from drinks a few days ago. 
She was damaging the dining table because she demanded we make room for her peloton. I ended up giving the table to a friend to hold onto so she could have her peloton. Now we don‚Äôt have a dining area which was also where we would work remote. 

When I communicate needing to get up early, it‚Äôs noise all night no matter how nicely I ask her to use head phones. 

She works remote and never leaves the apartment or our living room. I haven‚Äôt been able to relax in my living room in weeks. That‚Äôs also why I didn‚Äôt notice the damage to the coffee table until now. 

If there‚Äôs a day I can watch tv, the second I put down the remote to use the toilet she changes the channel and takes over the living room. Like fully exits out of Netflix or whatever show I had on. 

She won‚Äôt take out the trash and I‚Äôve seen her clean twice but if I even mention something being her turn to clean she immediately starts screaming about it being my mess and how filthy I am. 

When I do work remote she has zero respect for my calls and get angry at me for asking her to pause music or the TV. She blasts the tv all day. 

The kicker is our apartment is spotless. I‚Äôve had two dates over in the last 4 months and they both were shocked by her behavior and both said the space was really nice. The guy I‚Äôm seeing now recently spent the night and she made noise all night outside my room. 

There‚Äôs so much more I could add here but I‚Äôm desperate to get out. I‚Äôm essentially stuck in my room at home and avoiding coming home. If I do anything she dislikes it‚Äôs instant verbal abuse. 

I can‚Äôt afford to just break the lease or find a new spot and pay double rent. My mental health is declining and it‚Äôs impacting my work. I told the landlord that I do think she‚Äôll become physical at some point and they just don‚Äôt care. Please help! ",2,1736994676.0,AskNYC,2,1.0,False
1i2eq1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/comments/1i2eq1b/looking_for_feedback_on_my_tracking_app/,Looking for feedback on my tracking app,"I've been working on a tracking app with what I think are some unique features which I think would serve the users of this subreddit nicely. I haven't worked on it for a few months so would love to get some feedback to finally decide whether it's worth resuming development or not. It's still a little rough around the edges but fully functional [Momentum Tracker](https://momentumtracker.app)

*What gets measured gets managed* 

**Motivation for building the app**

I've designed the app to make it easy to ""measure"" by making it as frictionless as possible to input data whilst still capturing detailed information. On the ""manage"" side, I wanted to allow users to view their data at a detailed level, and also view correlations at a detailed level. For example with other trackers you may record you drank a ""coffee"", but this leaves omits information such as how much sugar, calories, caffeine etc there is. Even if you can add that data, it's often siloed inside each ""habit"". If you had ""Coffee"" and ""Snacks"", you often can't view the total caloric value. With my app, that's not the case as the underlying data is what's important, not the name of the habit.

I also added some AI features (just hear me out!) where instead of a numeric value, you can supply a prompt as the value and the AI will autofill that value. It'll also use any other data you submitted as context. If you went for a 1 mile run and don't know how many calories you burned you can instead put in a prompt and AI will fill in that value for you based on a 1 mile distance. Similarly you can add a photo and the AI will use that as context. Eg take a snap of the run stats from your treadmill, and AI will extract the information for you. The app will also extract the date/time from the photo so you could simply take a photo after each run and upload the images as a batch for the week. I've found this really useful for recording my weight progression without having to resort to getting a smart scale. I've found this really useful especially because taking a photo is already very frictionless. You could also use this to ""import"" data from another app by taking a screenshot.

**How to use the app**  
You create a reusable actions, eg Coffee.  
You add labels to the action. For Coffee that might be ""sugar"", ""caffeine"", ""calories"". There are no units, but you can add it to the label for convenience ""sugar(g)"" ""caffeine(mg). You can even add the same label multiple times with different units ""sugar(g)"" ""sugar(tbsp)"". If you can't be bothered to convert the values you could instead supply a prompt ""Convert the sugar(g) value to table spoon"".

Some values scale linearly, some do not, some are always the same. Eg a Run is one Run whether you go for a 1 mile run or a 10 mile run. Calories burned on a run scales linearly with distance. The duration of the run is always going to be different. So the action might look like

Run

* distance(miles) - 1 - linear
* calories - -100 - linear
* run sessions - 1 - fixed
* time(minutes) - slider(manual input)
* run-speed - *average run speed in miles/hour* \- prompt

Theres also a timer feature the the duration is used as quantity.

**Linking Action state with Labels**

This is kind of a checklist feature. You can have the action highlighted as Completed or Blocked based on that value of any label. A simple use case would be going for a daily run. You'd link the action with ""run sessions"" with a target value 1 and it would be marked as completed after each run. A more complex use case might be if you wanted to create an allowance system. You can have that snack only if your daily caloric intake is less than your target.

**Viewing Data**

You can view the data on the Charts. Add a new Chart Group and add the labels you want to view, along with whether you want to view the sum, average, or raw data.

If you have any questions, or feature suggestions just ask away!

He would first ask me to play ‚Äúrampage‚Äù, where id have to dress up in my old hockey gear head to toe and let him basically beat the shit out of me. 

      He‚Äôd go way too hard, and every time would eventually rip off my armor to just start hitting me normally. Always hitting me in places where the bruises wouldn‚Äôt be visible to my mom. Id always start crying and then he‚Äôd grab me by the neck and tell me to not say shit about this, it‚Äôs his only outlet as a bullied individual himself. And also he‚Äôd go on about how this was his only income so he would be homeless without me. So i made the virtuous decision to endure the beatings.

1. Let‚Äôs be real: the Siwas‚Äô downfall began after JoJo‚Äôs coming out and ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù so many contracts with Nickelodeon‚Äôs partners. While I‚Äôm 100% an ally, from the business point of view, it is to be expected that Nickelodeon would pissed due to the overwhelming number of parents who wouldn‚Äôt allow their kids to watch JoJo or potentially any Nickelodeon content. AGAIN FROM BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW. I actually am glad she did it anyway because she broke the status quo and laid a foundation for sexual minority in the future.

2. The Siwas‚Äô revenue came mostly from the bows and JoJo-branded merchandise (as stated by Jess on Abby Lee‚Äôs podcast). Once they parted ways, JoJo started losing revenue significantly (though not to the point of being broke, of course).

3. Siwas Dance Pop Revolution (SPDR) was a flop. It only lasted one season with eight episodes. Surely they weren‚Äôt expecting that.

4. XOMG POP!, due to poor management, eventually died. Members were leaving (whether by force or not), the Rolling Stone article came out, and 5 Fingers Pictures had its contracts with brand partners annulled (Moose Toys in particular). The tour flopped (no blame on the kids‚Äîthis was the adults‚Äô fault). The group is ‚Äúofficially‚Äù over now, and somehow they removed everything as if the group never existed. This signals the loss of yet another revenue stream for the Siwas. It also marked another failure for the family to prove their power in the industry.

5. JoJo was dropped by Columbia Records (as she revealed in a recent podcast). She continues to rely on rage-baiting, which is not a sustainable strategy for fame. Her videos often have a like-to-dislike ratio that heavily favors dislikes‚Äîmost of them have more dislikes than likes. This is another failure for the Siwas in proving their influence. By the way, check the view counts for Iced Coffee. Additionally, the album cover and lyric video (which has since been deleted) were AI-generated. JoJo also said she released the project by herself without Columbia‚Äôs help.

6. They‚Äôre now posting JoJo‚Äôs old content every week. Does this sound like a desperate attempt to earn revenue? Definitely!

Without us realizing it, the Siwas have been losing their power and jumping from one failure to another over the years.

All I can say is that karma is a B.
I do feel bad for all the girls and their parents. Imagine spending your and your kid‚Äôs childhood, money, and time just to be forgotten like that. These girls are extremely talented, even more so than Jojo who could barely sing (no offense, lol)

I‚Äôm glad some of the girls left earlier, whether by choice or coercion. At least they have more time to heal.

Now that the group is over and gone, I hope the girls could bloom individually and maybe hear more truth about the Siwas‚Äô terrible management ",17,1736993822.0,xomgpop,8,0.88,False

I am not exposed to a loud environment. My elf is good. Thoughts?",4,1736993753.0,tinnitus,1,1.0,False

And I am absolutely obsessed with the game. I chose to romance Lucanis; not just because his story intrigued me more but he also reminds me of my boyfriend. Coffee obsession, beard, long hair, witty comebacks. I loved every single character. I first played inquisition and I loved that one. This game was just so beautiful. I chose to save Treviso from the dragon and now I‚Äôm working on finding those last few chests I‚Äôm missing in each location. But, part of me is really hoping for another game. But the other half of me feels like this was a perfect ending to the whole storyline. How did everyone else feel once they finished the game? Do you hope that there will be another one after this one or do you think this one will be the end?",4,1736993682.0,DragonAgeVeilguard,4,1.0,False

1i2edem,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1i2edem/deep_depression/,Deep depression ,"I've had depression since I was a child actually 
It started around 5 years old
This was completely neglected, They said it was a learning difficulty, ADHD..
They even suspected that I was mentally retarded. 
It killed me inside 
Am I retarded?
How can I have this doubt???
I don't know.... And there are so many who have thought that about me...  
I was molested as a child by my mother, father, aunt...
I am forced to pretend that nothing happened ....
Well the consequences of this negligence were devastating...
During my childhood I was able to push with my belly... 
But that came at a price 
By the end of 2018 it was already deteriorating, I was in fifth grade at this time
But it exploded in 2019, everything falling apart, I don't remember very well, I lost a lot of my memory, but around September, October, November, December or so I started having sudden crying  for no reason, I remember I cried a lot in this times
But that's where my tears ended because after 2019 I really tried to cry, I haven't been able to cry for a few years now...
Then the dam broke in 2020 with the pandemic, and that year I was finally diagnosed with depression and anxiety
And from then on my depression only got worse over the years and never got better
I was admitted for suicidal ideation at the turn of the year for 2022 and spent my summer vacation there at the pachytrichus hospital
By 2023 I stopped being able to clean myself, often a month without taking a shower 

I'm Brazilian. Classes will start in February and I'm going into my third year of high school
I have the mind of a 6 year old
I have no dreams, goals, expectations, plans, horizons...
I'm only alive in the literal sense
And I don't even know how I didn't commit suicide and I'm alive now 
To tell you the truth, I'm not prepared to live after 14
...
I don't have any social life
I never leave the house 
And I don't know how to go grocery shopping alone, take a bus, use a credit card, make a coffee or anything
I know how to do what an 8 years old can do 
To tell the truth, even less 
At least I can take a shower, brush my teeth and eat by myself and get dressed only depression doesn't let go this
Today I'm going to try to take a shower and brush my teeth 
I know this is ridiculous to many, but....
I can't get out of bed 
....
But I will try at last
But today I was able to eat coffee and lunch...
Goodbye

The weight gain was gradual from 14 to 18. And I felt most comfortable in the 150s, I felt hungry when I weighed less but I started to feel a bit uncomfortable when higher. 

My family commented that I don‚Äôt look good by 145lbs-150lbs. My health was a comment but it was an afterthought. I started to rapidly put weight on after that as I tried to diet but I didn‚Äôt know how. I ate out a lot, and the amount of food I ate wasn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äûhuge‚Äù it was the cals. Eventually I got down to 160lbs, but I fluctuated between that and 150lbs. 

In my 20s I started grad school and lost a lot of friends so I no longer ate out socially. From age 21-24 I had physicals at the doctors and each time I lost weight. 160lbs‚Äî 151lbs‚Äî 143lbs‚Äî 137lbs.
I‚Äôm now around 133 but I don‚Äôt have a scale. My sister was always slim and she‚Äôs taller (5‚Äô7), my cousin is taller and also slim. So I guess it was jarring to them when I was suddenly near their weight because both accused me of unhealthy habits. They did so fairly early in the losing it journey too. 

I‚Äôve never kept my weight to this before, and I got family saying I should ‚Äûtone up‚Äù now. Or some friends saying like ‚Äûoh stay at that weight‚Äù or saying that I‚Äôm their competition. Idk it‚Äôs very odd. Then I have some other family saying I‚Äôm too thin and I gotta eat.

I noticed with some of my slimmer peers (who‚Äôve been so most their life), they will go low cal for their coffee, zero sugar drinks or water. Salad instead of fries. This goes for my sister and cousin. They watch what they eat in these manners and I don‚Äôt do that. But also they are smaller than me and I‚Äôm fine where I am tbh.",6,1736993577.0,loseit,0,0.67,False
