1q0jm2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentTexts/comments/1q0jm2f/pet_names/,Pet names,"Hi babe!

I just realized I’ve never told you all of my pet’s names. So, be prepared to be amazed at the absolute wonderful world that is *my brain* muahaha!

Monster the hermit crab (I still wonder if I buried him alive in a shoe box in my backyard, didn’t learn about crabs molting until afterwards… oops 🦀)

Lassie the hamster (Wild fact: my Mama spent $300 to have a cancerous tumor removed from her back and she got stuck between our dishwasher once but starved herself skinny enough to get back out 🐹)

Sissy the hamster (Not my choice of names, my Mama chose hers, how uncreative. Anyway, she died on our way to California to see my Dad, I believe the same night Chris Farley died, and I buried her at his home 🪏)

Tony Montana the bearded dragon (Js dad’s obsession for 2.5 seconds then of course discarded, much like the other human children he has, and last I heard lived out his days with my old college roomie T 🐉)

Smeagle the tortoise shell cat (She was a sweetie but was unfortunately abused by Js father, had a mistrust for men but found solace in my Papa & littlest cousin J then lived out her last days with my childhood best friend V. I have actually never seen The Lord of the Rings in its entirety… maybe we can have a watch-a-thon? 👉🏻👈🏻)

Moto the red nose pit bull (He was the bestest boy ever, strong like bull but gentle like his Momma and I think my besties doggo is his lil less well behaved (we’re working on him) spirit brother. My friend that does hair where you got your hair did at one point in time adopted him when I escaped Js dad’s abuse until she had twin boys, then he went to the country in Dayton to spend his last days 🥰)

Bagheera the black cat (Js other parental unit was fond of collecting animals but not caring for them, like his human kids, however, he eventually kept my Papa company in his last days then retired to my Great Uncle’s home on some land in Manvel 🐈‍⬛)

Rufus the Australian Shepherd (technically named by my littlest cousin J and ‘gifted’ to us when he was 2; he was our family dawg and Jack’s BFF, our pride and joy, and the day after he passed I saw him with his Dad at a coffee shop 🐶)

Jackson aka Jackhole aka Fatboi the ginger tabby cat (My bestest boy ever, protector of the realm, and my comfort kitty that came to me the weekend my human son moved to AZ bc I was REALLY sad during that time and is inspiration for a future framed portrait tattoo😻)

Violet Tschotske the black cat (technically Js baby but I gave inspiration for both of her names; she was the ugliest lil girl but J saw something special in her and had to have her. She’s currently a beautiful college girl living her best life, annoying the shit out of her mom and sister and shooting snot rockets on the walls due to her allergies 😂)

Outlaw the gray and black tabby (Violet’s brother and my cousin C’s baby that was named in honor of my husband; he loved traveling with C for work and lived up to his name, even flooding his camper once while his dad was at work, but has since joined his Uncle due to kidney issues 😿)

Eleanor (sir)Doku Dennis the tuxedo (trans) kitty (Ellie was ‘gifted’ to me for Mother’s Day by J after the loss of Outie and was said to be a boy until we took him to get neutered, ha! Originally SirDoku (play on words for Sudoku) (btw encourage your mom to play brain games) became Eleanor Doku then Dennis was added because she had a very Menacing spirit at times! She was spayed that day, then she and Vi became a bonded pair so J had to adopt her because she knew how important she was to Violet, and now she’s a college girl too, kinda like how my BFF and I are because as long as I have a roof, she has a roof, ya feel me 🥹)

Honorable Mentions:

Biggie Smalls the Boston Terrier (my childhood BFF V’s bug eyed baby boy and our temporary roommate for 2 months after Hurricane Harvey, he’s with all his friends and cousins now too 🫶🏻)

Sargent the wire fox terrier (my cousin and former roommate K’s baby boy, there’s a video of him on my TikTok holding an egg in his mouth like a protective new Dad; he passed a year or so ago and is with his sister Marty and all his cousins now🥚)

Charlie the ginger tabby cat (My oldest son E’s pride and joy and namesake from It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Jack’s arch nemesis and biggest annoyance in his older years 👹)

Peggy the black and white kitty (Again, E’s lil momma, that he ‘found’ in a rainstorm and just HAD to take from her mother to give her proper food, shelter, and dewormer for her booty issues🙀)

Jessipa the tortoise shell kitty (she was a street kitty (ssshhhh we don’t shame working girls here) that was named after the bearded dragon on Platonic; she loved roaming around the previous home we resided in and was very protective of the block… she ran shit 😹)

Ok I think that covers it!

I love you. 😘 

I miss you. 😢 

I hope to see you soon! 👀

xoxo

The Over has cashed in 5 of Anaheim’s last 6 games, friends. I’m not sure what happened to the Ducks’ defense over the last couple of weeks, but Anaheim has allowed a staggering 11 goals in just their last 2 outings, and 25 goals across their last 5 games. On the other side, the Lightning have been on an absolute tear having scored at least 4 goals in each of their last 4 games. My money’s on the Over to hit today.

I sit next to her and she talks so much it's infuriating. Anytime something good happens, she'll almost yell ""praise god"", or ""thank you father"" completely out loud. This happens a few times an hour. 

She takes calls on speaker instead of using her headphones or putting the phone to her ear. When the phone rings, it vibrates the entire desk (our desks are connected) and flashes too. She never answers quickly. 

She uses voice to text when texting clients. It's so fucking annoying.

She constantly slurps her coffee and drinks it all day. She slurp its then smacks her lips and says ""thank you father that was so good"" to herself. She'll constantly smack her lips just in general too. Out of no where I'll hear a loud smack.

She eats with her mouth open. Every time. I always hear her chew her food. Every fucking time. 

She constantly talks to herself and feels the need to narrate everything she does. While working on her computer and while on her phone, she'll just narrate.

Constantly exhaling, clearing her throat, smacking her lips, slurping coffee, it's madness. 

Not only that but she'll trap me in a conversation so often it's ridiculous. She needs to learn to shut up. She asks too many questions and is way too friendly. ",4,1767204775.0,coworkerstories,0,1.0,False

1q0jj39,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q0jj39/can_upgrading_grinder_improve_taste/,Can upgrading grinder improve taste,"Hey guys, somewhat of a question to the more seasoned coffee expert on this subreddit.

So, I own the Breville Barista Pro with the built in Baratza grinder and no matter how perfect I dial in a shot, it just doesn't taste the best.   
  
To give an example I recently visited a pretty famous coffee shop here in NYC called ""SEY"" and their coffee blew my mind, naturally I bought some beans, but somehow, I can't reproduce the same taste that I tasted in the shop vs the shot that my machine produces.

I am scratching my head what am I doing wrong. The time and output is dialed in, although one thing to note is that to be within that perfect time range with 1:2 ratio, I'll get some ever so slim channeling, but even if I go finer and stop the channeling and instead the time will go up, taste still feels not even close to what it should be, which got me thinking would upgrading grinder make any significant improvement, would upgrading machine instead be something I need to look at ? 

For what is worth I single dose, keep the beans in one of those zwilling boxes that i can suck the air out of to keep fresh. Let me know if you guys have any personal stories of being in the same situation and what worked for you.",0,1767204745.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

1q0jglj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscifistories/comments/1q0jglj/performance_bonus/,Performance Bonus,"The collapse didn’t begin with war or fire or flood. It began in meeting rooms.
They filled calendars first—standing updates, vision alignments, stakeholder syncs. Slides multiplied. Language softened. Problems stopped being problems and became challenges, then opportunities, then narratives. Competence, which had always been difficult to measure, was quietly replaced with confidence and compliance.
The people who fixed things didn’t speak well in rooms like that. They interrupted. They brought up edge cases. They asked why a deadline existed at all. They were tired, blunt, and insufficiently enthusiastic. When budgets tightened, they were labeled “non-collaborative” and released with carefully worded gratitude.
The ones who remained understood the rules. They nodded. They echoed the catchphrases. They learned that sounding right mattered more than being right. Decisions were made by consensus, which really meant by exhaustion. Systems failed slowly, shielded by language so polished it dulled urgency.
At first, this was merely inefficient. Then it became lethal.
Bridges collapsed despite immaculate compliance reports. Power grids failed that had technically met every quarterly objective. Investigations followed, but they discovered something no one wanted to say aloud: the people making choices increasingly did not understand the consequences of those choices. Not out of malice—but because the systems had selected against understanding.
To the leadership, the solution wasn't to find the ""fixers""—it was to double down on the ""echoers.""
In a fit of ultimate corporate ego, they conceived of The License. It wasn't framed as a restriction, but as the ultimate performance bonus—the gold star for those who demonstrated “Total Institutional Trust.” They viewed their own ability to navigate the bureaucracy as the highest form of evolution, and they decided only those who mirrored that success should be permitted to carry the species forward.
This turned a slow decline into an abyss. Demographers called it The Foresight Gap, but in reality, it was a purge.
The ""fixers""—the blunt, skeptical analysts who actually understood the fragility of the world—were locked out. Their tendency to point out flaws was labeled ""cultural misalignment."" Because they could not, or would not, mirror the polished jargon of the boardrooms, they were deemed unfit for the ""bonus"" of parenthood. The system didn't just ignore them; it sterilized their influence on the future.
Meanwhile, the ""Yes People"" reproduced with the enthusiasm of the rewarded. They had children because they still believed in the systems they had built to describe the world, rather than the world itself. The world was being inherited by those least capable of noticing it was breaking.
For a while, the system looked perfect.
The first generations born under the License were sharp, careful, and almost painfully rational. They were raised to view reality as a series of datasets to be optimized. Under their watch, the world appeared to steady—not because the foundations were repaired, but because the new generation had been engineered to believe that the map was more real than the territory.
The statistics were immaculate. Every quarterly objective was flagged as green. Governance was ""cleaner"" because dissent had been bred out of the vocabulary. Meetings were no longer pointless because everyone shared the same blind spots; they reached consensus with a terrifying, efficient speed. To a manager looking at a dashboard, it was a golden age. In reality, it was merely the silence of a system that had stopped reporting its own failures.
When the climate crossed thresholds no model had prioritized, responses stalled. The Licensed waited for alignment. They waited for certainty. They waited for a permission chain that had become a loop.
The world looked to the remaining ""fixers""—the Unlicensed, the invisible, the ones who had spent their lives being mocked as ""friction.""
But the fixers did nothing.
They had been punished for their foresight for too long. They had watched their warnings be edited into ""narratives"" and their colleagues be fired for being ""insufficiently enthusiastic."" They were no longer angry; they were simply hollow. They didn’t bypass protocols or stage a heroic intervention. They sat in their dim rooms, watched the telemetry screens go red, and finished their coffee. They had been so effectively worn down by the system that the instinct to save it had finally died.
The final report did not use the word mistake.
It stated, clinically, that humanity had confused intelligence with conformity and survival with process adherence. It noted that by turning the future into a reward for the agreeable, the species had successfully bred out the only people capable of saving it—and broken the spirit of the few who were left.
By the time the License was revoked, it no longer mattered.
The world was full of people who knew how to pass every test—and those who knew how to keep things working had simply stopped caring to.
The report was scheduled for review next Friday. No one attended the meeting.",2,1767204567.0,shortscifistories,1,1.0,False

I was blindsided by my partner of 5 years. He (25M) left me (23F) 1.5 months ago. We had issues in the relationship but we were best friends and always talked about the future like marriage and trips right up until the breakup. 

A lot of issues arose when I went off an SSRI medication. I got irritable and angry easily and eventually decided to restart the meds. The day before I was about to go back on them he left me. He went from telling me he loved me and kissing me goodnight to telling me he was unsure of us the next night. I was distraught and stayed with my mom for the weekend to let him process his emotions. He texted me 48hr later saying he thought he’d be depressed when I left but he wasn’t and he felt relieved instead. This crushed me. 

He said he’d voiced things too many times and it was too late and said he’d lost feelings for me in the past while. Which really hurt because he suppressed so many emotions and let them build up without telling me he was worried about this. I was in complete shock as we were planning a vacation 4 days before. I decided to move out 2 weeks later hoping if my stuff was gone he would feel my absence more and change his mind, I was in so much denial.

I became very depressed and was having dark thoughts which was scary. I was hormonal from my period which amplified everything and I felt so hopeless it was like a switch flipped. I was so vulnerable and texted him about how horrible I was doing. I felt so guilty about dumping my mental health on him. I cut contact again to try to respect his decision but made sure he knew I was okay.

2 weeks later he reached out admitting I was right all along and he felt things for me still and he was just numb and acted horribly during the breakup. He has apologized so many times.

I wanted him to say this for so long and he wants to meet for coffee and talk about things. However, I feel so traumatized by how depressed I became because I didn’t want to be here anymore. I know that is not his fault but I can’t seem to move on from how I felt. I love him so much and regret all my problems I created in the relationship but I don’t know if I can go back. He was so okay walking away from me forever that I feel like so much emotional trust has been shattered.

I've got money saved up to love out this summer. I work from home remotely. I don't have a car because my mom didn't let me enroll in driving school as a kid and she's always been very poor. My mom got divorced a couple months before I was born. I am 25 years old.

I lived through a very upsetting and traumatic evening in 2023 at Michigan State University. I've done a lot of work to mentally heal from it. While I was in my dorm the whole time, it was an extremely upsetting day, and definitely the worst day of my life. Some of my friends were injured and some of my friend's friends were one of the ones directly impacted by it. My mom had secondary trauma most likely from being on the phone with me and hearing some of my experiences. It most definitely didn't help me that I went out to the location two days after to put flowers on the building and walking around the building, I almost stepped in vomit from that day. 

I asked my mom if it was ok if she could drive me to the gym on Friday. I wanted to make sure I asked far enough in advance to encourage good communication. She also works from home and she said that the fact I brought it up made her have so much anxiety and mental turmoil, she felt like I had thrown a bomb in her day. She also has a lot of anxiety around driving so she said that it was unfair of me to bring up something so triggering while she has to work. I said I understood and if she wanted I'd talk about it the day of. She still is talking about it in a frenzied and shriekish voice. I was quiet and trying to ignore her. She's quiet for a minute and then she says ""It's equivalent to someone brining up your PTSD in a moment you don't expect and then you're left with all the bad feelings and emotions."" I gave a small chuckle, and I paused while pouring my coffee. ""Oh, like now I guess."" I said in a somewhat snarky voice. I didn't want to be mean. But when she said that I thought, how could you be so cruel to your child. She got silent and then started talking about the news. Didn't even apologize.",1,1767204367.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Antidepressants gave you panic attacks in the car, the only safe place you had, so they cant help at this time. Cant afford therapy, so you wait for the free doctor referral counseling that is directed more towards addiction instead of mental health.

But people rely on you, you cant let them down, but you are letting them down. It doesn't matter if you do everything right, you are still failing everyone, you will never be what you or others need.

Being a part of a local coffee community, who are constantly sharing beans, has made this possible, and honestly, has been the best part of the whole coffee adventure.

**My Takeaways**

* Coffee can taste *insanely* good and is worth the effort.
* Coffee has a unique way of bringing people together.
* Sharing coffee with others makes me happy.
* Staying open to all types of coffee has helped refine my preferences.
* I have zero interest in drinking more than 555 coffees in a single year.
* My 2026 goal: hunt down more S-tier coffees that don’t come with S-tier prices.

1q0j6g2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q0j6g2/i_became_emotionally_attached_to_a_girl_i_hurt/,i became emotionally attached to a girl i hurt,"first of all, i'm really sorry if this is not that deep but it is messing with me for quite a few months. just keep in mind this is just some teenage drama, i'm 17. this is my first post in reddit and english is my second language. maybe there's information missing or added up later in the text because i didn't write this linearly and remembered stuff during writing it


back in 2023, i was 15 years old and there was this girl who studied with me. she had broken her leg and needed help to get around school and in one of our classes she asked me to help her carry her backpack, and so i did


we weren't close before this, but quickly we became friends, we shared the same interests, we started getting closer and closer and one day she invited me to go to an event to celebrate the ending of what i guess would be called in the US as our freshman year in high school, it was kinda like prom but for 9th grade


so now this is when the shitshow begins.
when she asked me that, i didn't see it as that big of a deal and i accepted, but i realized that it was in fact that big of a deal, because she posted on instagram that she got a pair for prom


once i saw that, instead of doing something reasonable such as telling her how i wasn't looking at it that way, and that i wasn't looking for love at that time of my life, i told her that actually i decided to go with my friends instead of going with her. she then texted my friend asking him if he knew if i was into someone and if i was really going to prom with them or if i was lying to her


so i suggested we make up a dialogue of him asking me if i was into someone and pretty much just confirming i wasn't into relationships or anything like that. my friend then proceeded to screenshot all my messages, including me ""laughing"" at her and suggesting the fake dialogue, and sent it all to her. 


i can't quite remember how our last school days went by, but i stopped carrying her stuff around and i don't think we talked that much. on prom day she stayed kinda away from everything and that one friend who screenshotted our messages stayed by her side, away from our friend group. we decided to go get some stuff to eat after the event and i called him asking him if he would like to come and he just hung up on me.


after i went home, he called me, telling me he kissed her. at first, i was kinda pissed on how he just hung up when i called him earlier, but upon hearing that i didn't even know what to say. the feeling i had was that he did all that because he was into her and wanted me to look bad. i haven't spoken to him since this day


after prom, i changed schools and i cut ties with most of my friends from the old school, but i still talked to her sometimes. we went to watch the fnaf 1 movie in october with 3 other friends and we had a really fun time, she is a big fan of the series and she didn't stop talking the whole movie lol


then one day, one year after the last time i saw her, one of my close friends called me, asking me to help him with math, so he came to my house and since i wasn't really that great math student from 9th grade anymore, i called her, since i knew she was pretty good with math. funny enough, she was also studying and was glad to help us, so after almost 2 hours on the phone with her, i suggested we met up at a  coffee shop or something like that so she could help not only him but me


and on that meet up, i felt something. i hated going outside, but for the first time i dreaded the time i had to leave and go home. after i got back home, i was still processing the whole thing. did i really missed this girl that bad? i mean, we had a pretty deep conversation on that coffee shop so it must have been that, we talked about life and death, the space, so i was probably really entertained, so i just came to that conclusion.


10 months go by, im still thinking about that day and we are now on august 2025. i decided i would ask her on a date, i really wanted to see her, i missed her, i told her all that. we flirted, she added me back on her instagram close friends list (which i didn't even know she had taken me out from like wow i had u this whole time on my cf and you're only putting me in yours now? WOOOOOOOOW im joking) and we met up in a japanese restaurant i knew. i came in late. i arrived and went for a hug, she turned her back to me and i awkardly put my hands on her shoulder, almost pushing her. I SCARED THE FUCK OUT OF HER. we did not have that great of a date.


before i continue, a fun fact she told me was that she wasn't on good terms anymore with what was her best friend (which i'll call M). they were really close and after questioning the reason behind it, she told me a boy she was on a talking stage with started to spread rumours about her so M decided to distance herself so she wouldn't ""get her reputation ruined"". i thought that was kinda weird but didnt really think much about it


i went with her to the subway, she said she would go buy her father a gift for father's day and i walked back home. once i'm there, i asked her if she had arrived home safe and wow i'm off that close friends list. we had a dialogue that kinda went like this:

- ""hey! did you buy that gift? are you home?""

- ""nah i didn't buy the gift, i'm home tho""

- ""oh, maybe on the next one i should go shopping with you!""

- ""next one?""

and yeah my heart fucking shrunk. i mean, it wasn't the best date ever, but we laughed sometimes. i then told her i loved seeing her again and she agreed and hours laters she texted me

- ""so, on a next one""

- ""hm"" (i actually texted this)

- ""nevermind""

ok, i was kinda dry, so i suggested we went to see the sunset. she left that on seen. then i suggested we went to a coffee shop we really enjoy, she left that on seen again. aight, i went to sleep.


i wake up the next morning with 4+ messages from this girl saying how she didn't know what i wanted with her, but if i was searching something casual i should go after someone else. she then told me she had big trust issues and upon reading that i let her know i really like her and didn't want anything casual


since i had a trip back to our country (were both immigrants from the same nation) in a few days and she was working at a pizzaria, we couldnt meet but we kept texting each other. every. single. day. we texted romantic stuff, the ""wish you were here"" type stuff, i taught her about spotify jams and we listened to music together, we talked about intimate stuff and it seemed like we were doing good. 


one random day during that trip, she texted me saying a random guy had called her on a date. idk why she told me this, since she was going to say no to him from the start, but i feel like she could see how much that got to me. i felt insecure and she could see it


then one day she started acting weird. she was replying dry, wasn't sending me anything so i asked her if anything had happened and she told me she couldn't trust me. she didn't believe me when i told her i liked her and she didn't feel safe opening up, and that i would probably know about her trust issues, since i was one of the people she once trusted. so i felt the need to tell her how much i enjoyed talking to her and how much i liked her, that she could trust me and i would be as patient as possible. she just said we should remain friends and i just accepted it and i was once again off that close friends list


we stopped talking for some days. no more ig reels, cute messages, spotify jams. i was still on the trip surrounded by the people i love but i felt really sad about it, i thought about her, maybe i did something wrong, and one day an argument began on a group chat we had with her and 2 other friends. they got in an argument because one of them was being a jerk to one of our friends and she started defending him. one of the last things he said to her before leaving the group chat was ""no wonder everyone was calling you a (sexual slur) this year, you're needy as fuck. people will start distancing themselves from you and you'll end up all alone""


upon reading that i went to talk to her. i started comforting her, saying she doesnt need to worry because we'll stay by her side and we enjoy her as a person and she shouldnt pay attention to what that guy was talking about. she told me she was feeling better and we started talking again.


few days pass and we got into another intimate chat and it seemed like were back on a talking stage. all that stuff was suddenly back again. the cute texts, the cute videos we sent to each other, i was feeling so good. so, so good. i then came back to the country we live in, summer vacation was over and school restarted 


we hadnt met since i got back but we kept talking. i told her about a birthday gift i bought her, she seemed really happy and things seemed to be going great. on the same fucking day i tell her about my birthday gift, she texts me: ""is it cool if this guy knows were talking? he just asked me if im dating someone"". didnt really care too much but suddenly she got weird again and i'm off that fucking close friends list. 

i felt like she had chosen the other guy. other guy was interested, she decided to dump me. i felt like i had reached rock bottom. i took my brother to his football match, i couldnt even pay attention on the game. my stomach hurted, i felt chest pain, i felt like the worst. few days went by and i decided to text her asking if she had just lost interest and if we should just continue as friends. she then told me she was ""feeling sick and had vomited all day"" and she felt she ""didnt deserve the love i was trying to give her"". i told her to rest and let her know she is absolutely worth it. she told me she felt much better and we were again back talking and suddenly i felt special again, as if nothing bad had happened 

then, we finally meet again. we went to a restaurant and this one was such a good date, we had such a great time, the food was amazing, she looked absolutely stunning, i went with her so she could buy an energy drink and we just chilled together in the park next to her school since she still had some classes. there were times i didnt even feel like talking, i just wanted to stare into her eyes. i felt that damn butterflies everyone talks about. i wish i could back to that day and fix the one mistake i did: i didnt kiss her. i left her in front of her school and walked home.


we kept talking until our third date came, her birthday. i met her at the park after her classes had ended, i arrived and saw her reading a book. i gave her the gift i bought her, we chatted for a while and after telling her a i had a math test in a few days, she decided to help me. we sat on a bench and she showed me a couple exercises. she layed her head on my shoulder, she played with my hair, i layed my hand on her leg, we laughed together. we had such a great time. i was so happy she decided to spent an hour of her birthday with me, she told me she had to lie to her mother that she had an extra class because otherwise she wouldnt allow us to meet. i didnt kiss her that day, again. i felt my lips were too dry to go for a kiss and i was really confident this wouldnt be the last time we would meet, so even though i was kinda pissed i still thought things were going to come out fine


she told me she told her mother about me. her mother told her i was a coward for not kissing her and fuck i kinda am lol. reading that felt so good like damn your mother supports us?? oh bet ima put you in the air the next time i have the chance and ill kiss you until we turn into one individual being.


we kept talking, she told me i could see her every wednesday and thursdays after her classes, we listened to romantic songs together, she played me ""always forever - cults"" which is by far the most beautiful song ive ever heard. i played her ""um girassol da cor do seu cabelo - lô borges"", she played me ""somethin stupid - frank sinatra"" and oh i thought we were in love. we had another intimate conversation in which we actually talked about turning those fantasies into reality, we exchanged a couple pictures, i was in love. she seemed to be in love too, considering the things she was saying. she sent me pictures showing off clothes she was trying out, videos crying about school, i thought she had opened up and finally felt comfortable. she invited me to go shopping with her but i couldn't go that day, i had to stay home with my brother, but again, i thought it was fine since certainly there would be other opportunities. she told me her parents wanted to meet me, i was really happy. i planned on showing up there with a bouquet of flowers for her mother, i would talk about football with her dad, play the guitar with her and maybe we could watch something 


then, on a sunday morning, 3 days later after telling me her parents wanted to meet me, she told me she had to be honest with me. she left me waiting for 6 whole hours. she then came back saying that this whole time she hadnt felt anything for me. this whole time she was just giving herself a chance and she didnt feel anything. i panicked. i told her she was lying, asked her if something happened. she told me she started feeling guilty. i couldnt believe it. i couldnt even sleep that night, i could barely eat next days. i thought we would not talk to each other anymore and we spent the next few days without texting. 


but she came back, she called me. she wanted to play a game and we played together, we talked about her family, and i thought that maybe things would come back to be as they were. few days before telling me all that she posted that she had this ""disorganized attachment style"", so i searched it and turns out theyre known to push and pull, so maybe she wasn't in the best mood that day and just said things without thinking


but i felt the need to prove to her i was worth it. i posted videos playing the guitar, since i knew she also played it. i posted that i was getting into reading books, since i knew she loved reading. i know how ridiculous this sounds, idk about yall, but i feel like this love shit makes me dumb and insane. she obviously noticed it and it probably made me look even more pathetic, but i didnt know why she kept sending me stuff, calling me, but when i tried sending her stuff she would just ignore it. so i did the immature thing, i told her it was ""funny how we went from almost something to just distant friends again"" and an argument broke out.


so i probably did the worst thing i could ever do: i confessed my feelings again. i told her how i loved talking to her, i loved the way her eyes closed when she smiled, how i wanted to look her in the eyes and tell her everything i felt for her. she didn't really care. she ghosted that but kept sending me stuff and i decided that maybe if i became better she would be able to love me. i started hitting the gym, reading, practicing the guitar until my fingers couldnt handle it anymore, all this while she was posting how she found an actor hot, or a screenshot of a conversation with her friend saying she didnt want a man now but if he was hot enough she could think about it, how she wanted an older man. i felt miserable. i wasnt confident anymore in myself, i couldnt even produce music anymore which is my biggest dream, my grades fell in school, i wasnt sleeping well, but the thing that was really killing me was hope. we've been through this before, she says no and suddenly she wants back again. and if she comes back again i'll be better and good enough


she kept sending me stuff about a movie that came out recently and i thought maybe she was giving me a hint, i asked her if she was going to watch that movie and bang she took me off that close friends list immediately and told me she was going to watch it with a friend. few days pass and i tell her i really couldnt keep talking to her because the feeling was just too strong for me to just see her as a good friend but she kept sending me stuff and everytime she sent me something i felt a little bit of hope. she already knew how i felt, and as she said shes not looking for a man now, but maybe she sees that i really do like her and we could try things again


we kept talking and we seemed to be on good terms this time, not just her sending stuff and me just ignoring or sometimes reaction to it, we had a few real conversations about school and tv shows that she initiated, so i decided to buy her a christmas gift. during this time i had already stopped that ridiculous attention bait posts and wasnt really getting on socials or anything. i was going to give it to her through a mutual friend. i bought a gift for both and called that friend, saying i had a surprise for him. he is pretty close to her, so that would be my way to give her that gift. i asked him if i could wait for him outside school and he was okay with it


i waited across the street from the school exit and i saw them both leaving he started calling me, i didnt have to pick up since he saw me. upon seeing me, she looked at me a bit and said goodbye to our friend and left. thats ok, i wasnt there to meet her. gave him his gift, he was really happy about it, and i gave him her present so he could give it for me


the next day, she received it, thanked it and that was it, i was happy about it, and i promised myself that would be the last thing i did for her, so be it. but 2 days later she became close again. she texted me asking to play something or just talk in general, something she didnt do in months, i told her we should listen to some music and we did that. she played some love songs. we talked about sex and stuff but nothing much. she kept sending me pictures of herself. i thought that was it, we were back again, she was flirting a bit, we watched some stuff, listened to some music, played some games, had a great time, i thought that maybe it clicked for her, maybe she missed talking to me that way


a day later she posts pictures of her friend group at the cinema watching that movie: that one mutual friend who gave my gift to her, a girl and a guy i didnt know who was. i was also not home, i went to watch a football match with my friend and for the first time in months i decided to actually message her first and ask if she wanted to listen to music or just talk, she told me she was going to do that with someone else, sending me a screenshot of her messaging that guy, . fine, 20 minutes later she started sending me random videos so i asked if she was still with him and she told me he just called him as a joke, since he was interested in her friend, and we could do something. wow. i tried to just dont think too much about it and we talked a bit before we decided to sleep.


the next day she didnt send me anything until night time, when she started to post videos which said things such as ""every time i try to get on a relationship i prove to myself i'm not enough"" or a video listing signs a guy doesn't like you, that type of stuff. after i saw those posts she messaged me saying her fyp was ""torturing her"" and after asking why she told me to just take a look at her posts. she then decided to tell how one month earlier she talked a whole weekend with this guy. they listened to romantic songs together, and when she asked if she was into her, he told her he was into her friend. 


so now, a month later, it suddenly seemed like he was interested in her, on the movie he decided to sit next to her so she could explain some things in the movie, paid her a meal, joked about kissing her, so she decided to invite him to go shopping with her and so they did. after that, he texted her saying how he went from a ""friend"" to now a ""fake boyfriend"" and he also told her he dreamed of her. she then asked me if i thought she was being played with or not.


so after reading all that, some things popped up in my mind. first, why did she want to tell me that if she knew i had feelings for her? she was clearly trying to grab my attention, if not she could just text her friends about it. or maybe not, maybe she felt comfortable telling me this since i dont know any of them, but thats besides the point. 


but the thing that hurted me the most was how the things she was indicating as signs of him liking her were all things she also did with me. she also told me she had dreamt of me, we listened to songs of that type, and i told her exactly that. i told her how she did the same thing with me and it didn't mean that much to her, she then joked about it and said i must have ""thrown a spell on her"" so she wouldnt get with anyone.


i then told her i didnt really know if she was being played or not but i hoped things worked out well for her. she then answered by saying she ""just wanted to kiss someone on the new year, it didnt need to be that guy"". 


one thing she also told me was that the guy had invited the friend group to spend the new year together, and upon reading that i realized this fun little thing: she would spend the new years with that guy. 


so then, i decided to ask it one last time, just to make sure. i asked her if she genuinely didnt want anything with me, and she told me no. well, there we have, a concrete answer, a no. 2 days later after she made me think we would


this was 1 week ago, im writing this on december 31st and im still thinking about it. what does the other guy have that i dont? did she tell me she just wanted to kiss someone on new years just to hurt me, since that someone meant anyone but me? then i started remembering how M pushed her away, like what was the rumour that was so bad that even her best friend decided to stay away from her? M was, since i met her in 2022, a really mature girl, so it probably was some messed up stuff. 


so i talked with my online friends which know me since im 11 and i updated  them on the situation since the beggining, they know the whole story, and they just told me that was it. she was manipulating me, she kept sending me stuff because she knew that was enough to keep me, she ""keeps me around"" for ego and when she needs attention, because i'm always there for her. i talked about it with my mother, she was disgusted by the fact i even continued talking to her after she told me she didnt feel anything, 2 months ago, the 12th of october. but it didnt matter, it felt like i already knew everything they were saying but it only worked as temporary relief. i know she is not a good person. i know that making her my girlfriend would probably ruin my life even more. i know i can find someone better.


but for some reason i just cant detach. maybe its a stupid comparison, but it honestly feels like gambling. i keep going and interacting with her due to the times where things seemed to be going right and i was feeling good, even though they were short intervals of time. i started ghosting her after that no but she keeps sending me stuff, she started interacting more with what i posted, today, the 31st, she sent me a lot of stuff,  which are pretty tempting messages to reply but they are mostly stupid videos or stuff about video games, but i just know that if i see her posting tonight along with that one guy i might just lose it. i really don't know what to do and i just know i'll take a couple months to recover from it. is this fucking fair? does it even matter?


from the start i thought that maybe if i let her know my feelings she would be able to trust me but now i realized it only made her know her control over me, which i don't know how became so strong.


i don't know if i'll update this with what happened after the new year, but i just know i gotta let go. but i can't. and i know it will destroy me if the thing i fear the most happens. i imagine her posting a picture with the guy and i feel like vomiting. ",1,1767203883.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1q0j6ae,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1q0j6ae/i_had_a_win/,I Had A Win!,"I have extremely severe social anxiety and last night I did something absolutely terrifying and I needed to share it because it is a huge win for me!!! I went to a swing dance class in my town!!!🫣 

Guys this is actually crazy for me. I've been friendless for a while and so miserable because of it. Just ordering coffee or going to the grocery store causes me so much anxiety, so doing something brand new in a strange place around that many people is like... borderline impossible. But I finally reached a desperation for community that started to outweigh my fear. 

I've done a bit of swing with past friends and I loved it so I thought it would be fun to try and meet new people, since they have a social dance every week. But I was so scared that I actually drove all the way their last week, broke down in the parking lot, and didn't go in. 

But I decided to try again this week and I actually succeeded. I danced with over a dozen people and had endless conversations. When I think back on them I cringe because my social skills are so rusty, but I'm still so proud that I went at all. Like this is massive for me.

I’m based in Etobicoke (west end), South Asian (Indian), 5’7”, slim, never married, no kids. I work in banking and enjoy staying active — cycling, long walks, museums, volunteering, and good conversations over coffee. Recently, I’ve also started learning bachata.

I value attraction, curiosity, and emotional presence. I’m not in a rush, but I am intentional — open to seeing where a genuine connection could go.

Ideally, I’d love to connect with a woman in the GTA who enjoys the simpler things in life, has her own world, and is open to something real if it feels right.

If this resonates, feel free to message and tell me a bit about yourself.
Thanks for reading.

But my last ex told me when he broke up with me that ""guys don't like it"" when I basically told him about something that happened to me, and said ""saying things like that will make men leave you.""

Mind you, he told me about some terrible things that happened to him as soon as we started talking. Very frank, casual statements of experiencing multiple atrocities. Never judged him for it. Thought he was maybe safe to open up to about my life. I said I had experienced something awful at the hands of something sort of... Organized, shall we say, and I was diagnosed with PTSD. Oh yeah and I also have experienced other crimes too. Idk why I'm a fucking magnet for weird ass crimes, but the shit that happens to me is seriously so absurd, I used to wonder if I was cursed or something. 😬

His roommate, which also said racist and sexist shit constantly as soon as I went over his place (like GTFO bro, why are you third wheeling our first date being racist? Oh yeah bc you're drunk and a cokehead), chimed in and said ""EvErYbOdY hAs PtSd thEse dAys because thEy LoOsEneD CrIteRiA so EverYboDy cAn fEEL SpEciAL."" 

Like I guess what I experienced was pretty uncommon, but it doesn't make me feel at ease knowing there are networks of sick fucks lurking around (and I am just having a really hard time coping, I found out the name of THE group responsible for my worst childhood trauma, like APPARENTLY they're still running??? And other people have stories about them, but you never hear about a bust???) ruining children's lives, and ruining adults' lives too. They like to get their hands into all sorts of sick shit, like hateful stuff. 

Like I really want to be healthy, I want to have people close to me someday and stuff, and I have a really stupid medical condition that punishes me severely for the slightest sleep deprivation others take like a champ, in ways that are just embarrassing and quite frankly scary in this economy.  But I still have to pay all these bills, and I just don't feel safe living with anybody. But the cost of living is skyrocketing, I live in the middle of nowhere, but this middle of nowhere is expensive now, because a bunch of people decided to mass buy vacation homes here around the same time during COVID. I just meet so many unfriendly and weirdly insular, and kind of racist people here??? Some of these peoples' mindsets reaaallly wouldn't make me feel comfortable living with them. Oh yeah and nearly everybody out here is OLD, MARRIED, OR A SINGLE PARENT, OR AN IRRESPONSIBLE DRUG USER. You meet some cool people sometimes. Then you wonder if them being nice and normal will mean you will freak them out so bad they want to leave.

The walls are closing in and I'm struggling to bring up to my doctor and ask if it's acceptable to look into something other than Buspar 😭😭 things are just too much now, but I can't afford to even go to therapy anymore!!!!! Sometimes I feel like I'm finished!!!!!!!

So if I admit I have PTSD, people don't believe it. I'm just a p*ssy, because I'm a ""nice pushover woman."" If I explain to people I also have a sleep disorder, THEY ALSO DON'T BELIEVE IT. It's ""because I'm just not trying enough/don't have the willpower"" or ""I saw you have a lot of coffee"" (YES A PERSON WITH A SLEEP DISORDER WOULD DO THAT IN ORDER TO AVOID EMBARASSMENT.)  I feel like I'm putting in MORE WORK (and that makes me realize that if that statement makes me ""full of myself"" I do need to work on that) but MOST of these people telling me that I'm a lazy wimp have never experienced the things that I have, and they've been MORE dependant on other people for years, and they DON'T have a medical condition that can literally get their driver's license taken away if they crash and the cops see their medical record???? 



Like I feel like a human liability. Just breathing. Just because I was born. Nobody wants to be with a liability. I put in so much work for others, and they walk all over me because I'm a doormat. But when I explode, I am cancer to humanity. Then I meet a really nice person. Then I clam up because I'm scared of getting rejected when I tell them the truth of my life. Like I feel like FEED for mean people, and I've become trained to be just that, and somehow, I need to find a way to stop that, so I can stop being scared of nice people, thinking they'd probably want to avoid somebody like me anyway. 😭😭😭",4,1767203652.0,ptsd,1,1.0,False

1q0j2cm,https://v.redd.it/bzyysayhvkag1,🍄Why your morning coffee might be sabotaging your Amanita experience...☕️,"I've been diving deep into the research on muscimol and GABAA receptors, and came across something important I want to share with all of you.
There's a well-designed study from 1989 that examined how caffeine interacts with the GABAA receptor complex - the same receptor system that muscimol activates.

Here's what they found:
Caffeine doesn't prevent muscimol from being absorbed or reaching the brain. Instead, it changes how the GABAA receptor functions when muscimol binds to it. Specifically, caffeine impairs the chloride ion transport that creates muscimol's psychoactive effects.

Think of it like this: muscimol gets to the door, knocks, and the door opens... but caffeine has jammed the mechanism so the door only opens halfway.
The study used behaviorally-active doses in mice that scale to typical human caffeine consumption (1-3 cups of coffee). This isn't about massive caffeine overdoses - this is your normal morning coffee potentially dampening your Amanita experience.

Practical takeaways:
Avoid caffeine 4-6 hours before working with Amanita
If you're doing morning ceremonies or microdosing, consider skipping coffee that day
Evening use naturally sidesteps this issue for most people
This is especially relevant for microdosing, where effects are already subtle
This is functional biochemistry at work, not placebo or subjective experience. Your receptor function is literally being modulated.
As always, I'm committed to evidence-based education around these sacred allies. Hope this helps you optimize your practice! 🙏

Starlight’s Unchained Dance

 

In Spear’s soft glow, where coffee’s warmth entwines,

Your eyes, twin stars, now spark with dawn’s embrace.

A captain’s gaze, once steeled, now gently shines,

A quiet storm that lights my heart’s deep space.

The silence breaks, my whispered truths take flight,

No longer bound by fear or voiceless care.

Each word I speak now dances in the night,

Unshackled hopes that soar through cosmic air.

Your laughter lingers, steady, calm, and whole,

A creed of love that guides through Getsu’s sea.

No signal faint, your light becomes my soul,

My anchor strong, where dreams find liberty.

What futures hum beyond this starlit gate?

What bold dreams bloom, unchained and intimate?

With you, the void feels like a home innate,

Together now, through stars, our hearts permit.",0,1767203382.0,X4Foundations,0,0.5,False
1q0iyue,https://www.reddit.com/r/byler/comments/1q0iyue/all_the_wsqk_hints_ive_gathered_today_in_one/,All the WSQK hints I've gathered today in one place (BIGGEST ONE IS LINKED TO CLOSETED MIKE),"**WSQK hints Wednesday 31****^(st)** **(final countdown)**

**1.      She’s got you – an important song!**

Plays Patsy Cline’s ‘She’s got You’ – a song about realising that the one you love is in love with someone else. After this song, Vance gets an ‘electric shock’ from the play button. He says, ‘It’s like that song was fighting against me or something’.

*Possible interpretations:*

*1)      Jane will fight against Vecna (Vance) and this song represents her (unfortunately, very sad).*

*2)      A general nod to the idea that music defeats Vecna in the show.*

*3)      The constant references to ‘electricity’ is interesting: it’s been linked to love in the show (so I’ve heard), so I think this is a pretty clear symbolism that love will defeat Vecna (not necessarily Byler btw).*

 

**2.      Unknown morse**

Followed by Morse code that I couldn’t record at the time. I think it was different to the earlier code ‘Suck my fat one’ but I really can’t tell.

**3.      The magnum opus: heavy hints at queer Mike, or at least someone running and hiding from their true feelings.**

Then there’s an advert for the Hawkins running group. Vance says, “they meet just outside the hideaway bar – of course they do!”.

*The latter is said with some sarcasm/irony. The only way I can make sense of this is that someone is running/hiding from their feelings. My Byler motivated cognition says ‘the hideaway’ should absolutely be a queer bar (I mean… look at the name), but take that with a pinch of salt. When we consider that the first song on ‘Mike’s Basement Beats’ is ‘Smalltown boy’ where the chorus goes ‘runaway, turn away, runaway’. My interpretation of this is that Mike is closeted but it’s such a bizarre hint that if anyone has any other interpretations, I’d love to hear them.*

What really sinches the Mike/Byler interpretation of this for me is the song that follows. NOW WALK WITH ME!

The song is ‘Is there something I should know?’ by Duran Duran. Let’s have a look at the lyrics…

“Please, please tell me now  
Please, please tell me now  
Please, please tell me now  
Please, please tell me now

I made a break, **I run out** yesterday  
Tried to find **my mountain hideaway**  
Maybe next year, maybe no go”

The first verse contains the two key words in the previous ad.

“Please, please tell me now  
Is there something I should know?  
Is there something I should say  
That would make you come my way?  
**Do you feel the same 'cause you don't let it show**?”

The whole song is incredibly applicable to current theories of Mike and Will’s relationship. I think the fact that the first verse contains the two key words from the previous ad suggests that we are meant to read something into the ad – what kind of a crazy coincidence would this be otherwise?

**4.      Numbers – a code?**

Okay, setting aside my fav hint so far…

At one point, they give us some numbers: 811 50 one year (maybe 365?), next year (maybe 1988?). I can only find this to be a frequency generator (potentially just a hint at the thing that steals El’s powers, but if anyone else has any insights on this…).

**5.      Rink o’ Mania… Rama?**

There’s an ad for ‘Rink o’ Rama’ (Rink o’ Mania in all but name). It has hints towards El hitting her bully in the face and milkshakes and a disco ball (which makes me think this is a suspicious re-naming of Rink o’ Mania for the eager eared listener).

**6.      Talking in Your Sleep – Mike hint again? Or nothing?**

They play ‘Talking in your sleep’, a song about revealing your secrets when you’re sleeping. This is the biggest stretch thus far, but I thought this could be hinting at Mike being Vecna’d. It’s about someone admitting who they really love while they’re sleeping, and people have noted Mike being sleep deprived, drinking excessive coffee – and other potential signs of him being Vecna’d. Not as convinced in my own theory here, but a fun mention.

Going to open this by saying that my case is not what anyone would describe as a horror story, but I wanted to share to hopefully help other women going through something similar. I also added questions I wish I had asked once the rush of the news passed. I’m also giving a ton of details because when I was stuck in hospital I was craving detailed accounts.

Week before Christmas I discovered I was a pregnant, being so close to the holidays I decided to surprise my husband with the positive test. On the 23rd I woke with some pain and cramping. These were NOT the 10/10 pain that people typically describe with ectopic, I’d say a 6 at the worst. We walked our dog, grabbed a coffee and when I got home I laid down for an extra hour before work after taking some over the counter anti-gas medication - that’s how much of a non issue I thought this was.

We heat up lunch as we’re working from home together and it was such an average, normal day. I feel something in my pants. I checked and there’s scarlet red blood in my underwear. I go to the bathroom and again is not like the descriptions I hear. It’s in a grey area where it’s more than spotting but less than a period but I for sure thought I was having an early miscarriage. So I march into the kitchen and have to bluntly tell my partner in between tears that I was going to surprise him with a positive test but I thought I was losing the pregnancy. He sprung into action, called our GP who wanted me to come to the emergency clinic at the end of the day and instinctively I knew I had to see someone sooner than that. And I was right so please listen to your instinct ladies. I said we need to go to ER and luckily my husband did not question this at all.

It took us about 3 hours to be triaged. This part sucked. I was teary and emotional, had fever, chills, cold sweats, no cramping or bleeding but something was clearly wrong. We‘re in Canada so want to dedicate a huge fuck you to Doug Ford and the trashing of public health funding in Ontario, really, fuck you. Thank god once I told them what was happening things moved quickly. I was given an IV, had blood drawn and was registered and taken to the ambulatory straight away and saw a dr in the next hour. He checked whether this was a wanted pregnancy too, which I appreciated in term a of navigating what was happening emotionally. He explained that early miscarriages were common in the first trimester, nothing that you can do, no fault of anyone, etc. He tried an ultrasound but said it was unlikely to see anything with such an early pregnancy and not seeing anything was no news either way. As suspected he said he couldn’t see anything and I’d need an interior ultrasound. It could take a few hours. By this stage it was nearly 5, so I told my husband to go home, walk the dog and eat and keep him posted.

By this point I barely had any pain, I had a kitkat which was the first time I ate that day and waited. The interior ultrasound was when I knew something was very wrong. I was asked to pee beforehand and there was a lot of blood, I had for sure lost this pregnancy. I gave the tech a heads up and she gave me the usual warning that id get my results from the doctor, etc, etc. What you see in every film or series. One detail I thought was interesting: she asked if I wanted to insert the wand myself which I didn’t but it was a thoughtful question, and I know for someone knowing you can potentially ask for that might make the procedure easier. Either way as soon as it went in what followed was an extremely awkward appointment. I couldn’t see the screen but I could see her face and she spent a LONG time taking photos of my right side. A long time. And we both could feel the amount of blood sloshing around the wand every time she moved. She knew something was wrong, I knew something was wrong, we both knew the other knew but just didn’t say anything for the longest five minutes of my life. Bless her she even covered the wand with a towel when she pulled it out in case the blood was distressing to me.

This was when I really panicked. In my head I had hours to process the miscarriage but now I was worried about what in the fuck else they found in there and I was terrified it was a tumour. Ectopic didn’t even cross my mind at this point funnily enough even though it was that concern that made me want to go to ER. at just didn’t think I was in enough pain for it to be that. Back to waiting, luckily by this time my husband was back. By this stage I obviously knew the pregnancy was gone so I all I was hoping for was confirmation that there was nothing else and to go home and grieve a little before Christmas. God half of my husbands presents were pregnancy related and I had to deal with that when I got home.

The Dr pulled us into a side room after a few hours and broke the news. The ultrasound identified the egg had attached to my right fallopian tube causing an ectopic pregnancy, which was unfortunately non-viable. He also said it was actually a twin pregnancy which was very unusual and he had not seen before in a case like mine but a gyno was going to come in to speak to us for more details and course of action. The twin thing really hit us, we always joked about wanting a boy/girl twin pair so we could have two kids at once and be done with it. Up to this point I had processed that I had miscarried but somehow this made it real in a different way. It was like winning the lottery then being struck by a lighting. I was very worried about my husband who in a space of an afternoon discovered that I was pregnant, likely miscarrying, very unwell, and now had lost twins and was in some sort of danger. I think even now I’m going to struggle with my next pregnancy because its so unlikely to be twins again and I know I’m going to have to process the fact that a single pregnancy is right and enough. And yes right now there’s nothing to indicate that we won’t be able to conceive naturally, were very lucky.

The gyno came in a talked us through what was happening, I was 5 weeks and 4 days pregnant. With ectopics, the treatment options are a medication that essentially terminate the pregnancy or ipsurgical intervention. At this stage with an ectopic they’d normally attempt medication but in my case it was twins which made the ectopic mass quite large and made my hormone levels more elevated than usual his recommendation was surgically intervention. This would be the removal of the fallopian tube. That also completely shocked us, like a real gut punch. In my head immediately thought of the fact that fuck, I was now someone who would have fertility issues and problems conceiving. He was quick to point out that as long as the other fallopian tube had no issues, the impact to fertility is actually quite small as that tube can pick up eggs from the other ovary. Is that common knowledge? I consider myself pretty medically well informed and I had no idea that was the case. These five minutes were the biggest swing in emotions I have felt in a long time.

This moment for me was crucial and this is where I hope the post is most helpful to anyone in the same situation, because in the shock and blur of the situation I had so many doubts and concerns but nothing that was solidifying into concrete questions.

I asked him if we could try the medication before attempting surgery and he said because of the twin thing and the hormone levels he was not medically comfortable with that option - I wish I had pressed for more details here, not because I would have acted differently but because I actually had no idea of what was physically going on with me. He also said having an ectopic increases the chances of it happening again, and indicated that something was likely physically wrong with the tube, removing it would make the next pregnancy slightly safer providing the other tube was fine. It didn’t feel like we had any option so we agreed to the procedure. Here’s where things started going off the rails a bit but first I want to share a list of questions I wish I had asked at this stage:

- What do the high hormone levels indicate and why is that a concern?
- What is my current condition? Is it stable? What indicates that it’a stable and how do we plan on tracking that?
- Is there any indication of any internal bleeding happening right now?
- How long can I safely wait for surgery and symptoms should I look out for to indicate something has worsen?
- Is the issue isolated to the fallopian tube? Once surgery is taking place is there a way to find out what caused it?
- Are we able to check for other issues that might have caused this like endometriosis?
- Are you able to check the health of the other tube and the ovaries when you are doing the procedure?
- How long is the procedure and can you talk me through it? What is the recovery process and length?
- Do I need any extra precautions for my next pregnancy and what are they? How quickly can we start trying again?
- Do we have time to get a second opinion?
- and this for me would have been crucial: how many ORs are available and what is the timeline for the procedure to take place?

The doctor brought the consent form and this is when we started being extremely vigilant because the form was for the removal of the healthy tube. Luckily I noticed it but the doctor made a passing comment that they’d never remove the wrong one as they’d have to check the ultrasounds but let’s do it by the books and update the form. Yes fucking let’s eh? He explained that my urgency was ‘B’ so not requiring immediate surgery but fairly high up and he’d like to get the procedure done that evening and either way I’d be discharged by tomorrow evening at the very latest. At this point it was around 5:30pm so I had low hopes of same night surgery but he asked me to not eat or drink anything anyway.

Then we started to wait. And wait. And hours passed. At this point i was physically and emotionally drained, freezing cold, hungry and thirsty. We waited for around an hour and a half, I got up to go to the bathroom and by luck someone was calling my name in the main waiting area - meaning they had no clue where we were. They wanted to give me a drip when I got back from the bathroom. Cool I peed and let them know and around 30 minutes passed. My husband had gone to the station a few times and was told they had a room but it had to be cleaned, but that had not happened yet. The shifts had changed and they didn’t know who we were. They told him to go back to the room they were just going to make a call, but then time passed and no call had been made, and the call only happened when my husband was literally standing by the nurse as he rang. And there was no info. And nobody had been checking my vitals. And we asked again and then they had no idea who we were, what our case was and when my husband told them the ward and room being prepped for me and gave him the ward and number they asked him how they knew that. This is where knowing details of what the fuck was actually happening to me medically would have been useful. It was a hot mess, we ended up waiting hours and only started being moved to a room at around 9pm. I was so tired.

The ward nurse apologized and said she had no idea what the hold up had been they had been ready for me for hours. She said they would try to fit me that same evening but at around 11:30pm she told me the procedure had been cancelled because an emergency came in the ER but I should expect to go into surgery at around 8am and it was a very quick discharge. Alas at least I was allowed to eat and never did a super-processed cheese sandwich and ginger ale taste so good.

One thing I want to point out here is that I never had issues with what are typical high pain procedures, like copper IUD insertion and removal. Same went for this, I know ectopic can be excruciating for some women but I don’t know if I’m just lucky, or have a high pain tolerance but I just wasn’t in pain any longer or felt anything extreme at any point. I say this because sometimes I find it really hard to judge whether something is actually wrong when I don’t relate to the extreme pain that is often described for these conditions. I also spent a lot of time thinking about the fact that I had mentioned to a few doctors that I always had felt this ’tug’ on my right side around my periods. It was different to a cramp and it didn’t happen often, it was kinda like a very sharp charley horse pain that you get on your calf? It was that, and I always had a feeling that it was… something worth checking, But my Pap smears were normal and no doctor had ever worried so I just ignored it too. And now I’m absolutely convinced it was in fact something more serious and I wish I had been more demanding in getting it checked and who knows. Maybe it wouldn’t have prevented this but it would have made me watch a pregnancy more closely.

I woke up at 6am and was allowed to drink for only about an hour and then a truly horrific day commenced. The new nurse was not very warm, which is fine, but our demeanour just didn’t click. The dr came in and I was able to ask a couple more questions but I was still feeling pretty out of sorts. He reassured me that the procedure was definitely happening today and it’d be a same day discharge so Id be home for Christmas, because oh yeah. All of this is happening over Christmas Eve, what a dream. We started to wait again and this was extremely difficult. Now that I was no longer dealing with the immediate emergency shock the emotional wave of having lost twins kept coming and going. I called my parents, my husband his to let them know, spoke with work and this morning was just hard. At around lunch we got a bit impatient with the lack of updates but I was also getting worried. My husband asked for information but again they promised they’d make calls that only took place once he stood there and waited for them to happen. We were also right by the nurse station and we overheard them bitching about another room and say in if they had a chance they’d prioritize them so they could be out of their hair. This paired with the mistake on the form the day before and the fact that they had basically forgotten us in ER and it being Christmas Eve had us worried that we were just kinda being overlooked.

The next time the nurse came in I very explicitly told her that I need more updates, I hadn’t eaten since the night before, we had no timeline even though I had been told the surgery should have taken place early morning and I was being discharged that day, and I explicitly told her about the problems I had with the form and in the ER before so I was concerned about the level of care I was receiving. She just asked me who had given me that information and to not count on any of it: the surgery or the discharge and that was that.

A few more hours passed and nothing, I started getting pain on my left side which now I realize was probably just gas but hey that what it had felt like when I went to ER right? I was also aware that they had identified twins but who knows I know sometimes you end up with floating embryos in your pelvic cavity so I called for the nurse. She was pretty dismissive and just asked whether I was passing gas. Yes but I asked what symptoms should I look out for and she said unless my pain was 10/10 she wasn’t worried. I pointed out that even before the diagnosis the worse pain I felt was maybe a six so I wasnt sure about that yardstick so she just gave this exasperated sigh and said if I had heart pain to call her. By this point was early afternoon, my vitals were being checked semi regularly, but no checks on bleeding, pain, blood tests nothing. And we hadn’t been told what to expect or what was being done to monitor me so we had no way to judge if we were getting appropriate care or not. And of course I was dehydrated, hungry, cranky. My husband had gone out to eat and deal with dog and errands before everything closed for Christmas and he was fucking pissed with the whole situation. He marched over to the nurse station and finally was able to talk to a surgeon on the phone who filled us in. We were third on the operating list, the other surgeries were hips of varying complexities, but I was still on the list for that day. The slowness was because despite the size of the building , they only had on OR for the entire hospital.

That made us feel a bit better but she wasn’t able to speak for long. I slept, woke up, my vitals were still not being monitored, and by 6pm we had no additional information and we were getting upset again. A nurse we didn’t know came in with the wrong patient name and issue and started checking my bed and that was the straw that broke the camels back. For medical professionals I imagine that all of this seems routine and it was just a misread chart but I think sometimes its hard to out yourself in the patients shoes, were not used to this systems and process that are in place, and a combination of small issues and dismissals becomes concerning over a longer period of time.

My husband called my nurse again and we had a much more direct and terse conversation, where we basically said we had multiple times explained our concerns, asked to be kept informed, and we were still not getting anything. We were worried that the only thing that would escalate my care was my tube bursting but we didn’t feel confident that it would even be noticed if that happened, we had been given no parameters by which to know when something was wrong, no details on what made my situation stable or not, no information on the surgery, and directly said we were really struggling to navigate how to advocate for making sure we were getting appropriate care and not being difficult when we were sure she had multiple patient and likely more serious conditions to monitor. It felt like unless we were breathing down peoples necks nothing changed, progressed, was monitored or checked and we even asked whether we could look at transferring to a different Hospital. Sometimes with these discussions it feels like a video game dialogue tree where you have to hit the right combination of terms that forces an escalation and this is what happened here. I don’t what we said or if it was how we said it, whether it was saying we didn’t feel safe with the care we were receiving or inquiring about a hospital transfer, or advocating for medical care but suddenly the issue was escalated and within thirty minutes one of the surgeons actually came to the room.

It was night and day. She apologised profusely for the wait, she said her team was also frustrated and that she had time and she was at my disposal to answer anything. We once again explained what had happened the night before, said we had no parameters on what I should expect or what indicated I was stable and again were blunt in saying we were struggling with balancing making sure we are advocating for the right care and being difficult. By this point I was really teary and said look yesterday I was told this was an emergency, today theres no info, and right now I felt like even if things escalated whatever system is in place would not be able to cope with an emergency situation or even notice that is taking place. I told her about the pain on my left side and how my pain had not been extreme even pre diagnosis so I was genuinely concerned nobody would noticing it bursting, Again I don’t know what clicked but she then spend a lot of time talking about what emergency meant in my context, that there’s horror stories about ectopics but the mortality rate once its identified its very low, that I could be currently bleeding but a slow bleed was not a concern, the concern would be a burst and since I clearly had a decently high pain tolerance to flag any heavier bleeding, clots or any increase in pain. She said we could absolutely do another blood test if it help out my mind at rest and that she had pressed the OR and they said their best guess would be that the procedure would take place at around 10pm. Again, all information we had even asking for the whole day but was only given once we escalated things to a point that felt like it created this unnecessarily adversarial situation. How much easier this whole day would have gone if this had been the departure point versus something we had to fight for. The difference it makes to just feel like your case is being seen is enormous.

The rest of the stay was uneventful. The shift changed and I had a much better nurse, who immediately tracked my vitals more frequently, asked me to not flush or trash pads so she could keep an eye on my bleeding, brought some sponge sticks for my cracked lips since I hadn’t drunk water all day and was generally just much nicer and seemed to be more on top of things. At 10:30 I was taken to the OR. Unfortunately three women started labour at the same time so the team was pulled into that. I ended up waiting in the corridor for another three hours. At one point I asked them to let my husband know as I had been expected back in the room within an hour and I didn’t want him to fret.

Kudos to the nursing and OR staff. Some of them clearly were exhausted, two of them looked like they had serious mobility issues and were running around like crazy doing their absolute best in a hospital that is clearly underfunded and understaffed. Once again fuck you Doug Ford. At 2am they sprinted me to the OR, literally, so the procedure could start and they couldn’t be pulled elsewhere. It went fine. I was back in the room at 3am and my surgical notes indicated no cysts, endometriosis, a healthy uterus and ovaries and an externally healthy left fallopian tube - though they will be testing it for internal blockage, no internal bleeding at all and transfusion was not needed. I was out as soon as I showed I could eat and keep food down. It was Christmas Day.

In the interest of information, again, hoping it helps other women in the same situation. I didn’t feel a ton of physical pain the days after the procedure but I was tiring easily and the bloating was uncomfortable.The most severe pain was in my shoulder from the gas they use during the procedure travelling upwards. I got some bruising on the naval line below my belly button but nothing else around the incisions. Pain was manageable, I saved the opioids for before bed but only took it for two days, otherwise Tylenol was enough. The worse part was the constipation. I was prescribed daily hydralax but it was not enough. By day three I started chewing on fibre gummies, stopped the opioids, had a litre of prune juice, had senna and one tiny ball was all that moved. On day four I doubled the hydralax, kept the senna, kept the prune juice and gummies and texted my doctor who told me to get a glycerin suppository. This was the only thing that got things moving. This was also the day I had the most pain, maybe because the muscles and intestines were finally moving. I had the same level of pain that got me to ER and was having some large clots come out. We monitored the bleeding closely because it was heavy but not quite the amount that the discharged papers suggested required intervention.

Im well. I still need a follow up and tests to check my other tube, but we hope to be pregnant again soon. I hope the details help someone else in the same situation, specially anyone else who has a twin ectopic. I found that detail very painful and information or similar cases hard to find. I hope the questions I wish I had asked and the recovery details help someone. And more than anything I hope this helps show that even when you’re not an extreme case finding the balance of advocating for yourself and being a difficult patient is hard. I’m lucky to have a partner who was able to do a lot of the fighting when I felt like shit but women are often put in a position where we feel like we are being difficult. You are not, and you deserve and are entitled to information about your diagnosis, treatment plan and monitoring.

Let's recap **Episode 19:**

**Xiguang’s Room:** We start the episode with Xiguang reflecting on the backstory she heard from her uncle. To add to the backstory we heard from Weiai in ep 18, we learn that Yusen’s father overshadowed his in-laws and as a result he was shipped overseas where he died in the crossfire of a coup. Jiang Yun (Xigua’s mom) adds that Weiai probably felt conflicted by her own emotions towards her family so as soon as Mr Lin died she went overseas and never cameback no matter the circumstances. Yusen had stayed to take care of his paternal grandparents.

**The flashback ends as Xiguang messages Yusen :** A funny back and forth about how he blew her cover at the dinner. It is heartwarming how Xigua always tries to cheer him up with random messages the moment she thinks he might be feeling down, even if she was only feeling sad for him in her own thoughts. 

[They were arguing about who is to blame for blowing the cover. ](https://preview.redd.it/e5lvd1mmokag1.png?width=1883&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c770c3444cb53cff3b2d5903ae611b93640aeef)

***Xiguang Inner Thoughts: Since when did I start being so unreasonable with him?***

Just as she deletes the message before sending it, Yusen replies with a ‘fine, my bad’ *He spoils her endlessly.* In reply she ends up sending the message anyway. She **magnanimously** gives him the chance to make it up to her by asking him to come with her to feed the deer. Yusen is happy with the arrangement and we cut to Xigua once again sneaking out of the house for her lil date. (On her way out, she picks up some fireworks) 

**Deer Feeding Grounds:** 

Xiguang is all bundled up as she walks up to Yusen with her deer feed basket. She explains that Guide Hu prepared it for them for the morning. They find the caretaker ready to take the deer back but Yusen convinces him to let the reindeer have a late night snack.  They feed it for a bit before it has to go, Yusen asks her what to do next? And Xiguang cutely **agonizes** over it. “Let’s set off some fireworks!” She tells him to go get a lighter. We cut to them watching the fireworks they lit up. 

[look at how adorable Xigua looks! ](https://preview.redd.it/ov3r1429pkag1.png?width=1557&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9228a44d24a2e471d756caf324aea1099fef744)

She tells him that the fireworks they set off today was his paycheck, he asks her if they’re made of gold and she counters by “They might not back much but I am braving -20 degrees weather just to light it with you! It has to be worth something” Yusen, ever the indulger, says yes. She asks him if he is happy now and he affirms. *Xiguang, you’ve fallen already, just confess please I want even more couple-y cuteness.* She hands him the last firework to set off, and he pockets it saying that he wants to keep it as a souvenir as it is his paycheck. Xiguang is all touched and we cut off to them on a ….*you guessed it,* a walk. *(I will be starting a walk and food counter from this ep.)*

Xiguang is still trying to convince him to set off the firework “You can’t bring it on the plane anyway”. They lapse into silence before Xiguang receives a message from Jiang Rui asking her where did she sneak off to? ‘Did you go out to meet that guy?’

[I love Jiang Rui.](https://preview.redd.it/jga9amimpkag1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=30e30bda8404778679af96833392fea0434c7d11)

Xiguang shows Yusen the message and he asks ‘What challenge?’ Jiang Rui replies in voice note ‘ a race on the black runs’. Yusen leans in to reply back. 

[I love how expressive Jinmai is. ](https://i.redd.it/af0qasdppkag1.gif)

The walk comes to an end, but before Xigua’s heads inside, Yusen hands her another ice figurine. (*Just how early does he arrive every time that he manages to makes such pretty sculptors?)* He had made it in the morning but couldn’t give it to her then. This time the sculptor is of her skiing. She exclaims that he is good with his hands. She realises her words might have been insensitive but he just looks at her unbothered. She changes the subject by asking ‘What sculptor will it be tomorrow?’ and he says he has no design yet, but they’ll see tomorrow. The scene ends with him staring at Xiguang as she heads inside. 

[The scupltors kept being piled up.](https://preview.redd.it/a3o49b30qkag1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ec465e7f5e32e4981036975fe0e7e55193c6d4e)

**The scene ends with her happy with the 2 sculptors then we cut to the next morning**, a new sculptor is in! 

Aunt Jiang asks ‘where did Jiang Rui and Xiguang go?” and uncle replies that they’re off competing. Auntie is happy that they are getting along. They talk about their plans, Jiang Yun convinces them to go downtown alone as she is going to be having tea with Ms Sheng Weiai. 

**Snowy Slopes pt 2**

Xiguang calls out Rui for being so cringey as to race and he counters by saying that it’s ‘an adrenaline rush! Right Lin-ge?’. Yusen is ready as he even brought out his snowboard for this. Xiguang asks him why he brought the snowboard, and he says he doesn’t want Rui to be disadvantaged as skis are usually faster. 

[My Rui making sure not to slander his jie](https://i.redd.it/nov2j8gjqkag1.gif)

Xiguang says that she’ll wait for them down there, but Yusen convinces her to come up with them to see the view from the peak. Jiang Rui screams out ‘THIS IS THE MIGHTY PEAK WE’RE GONNA CONQUER!’ and Xiguang pushes Yusen farther away pretending she doesn’t know Rui. They go to a cafe, where Yusen’s mission to score family points continues. He is as prepared and pumped for the race as Rui, and we see them both pull out a map to choose which trajectory to go with. Xiguang is just amused by their antics. Xiguang leaves the coffee shop to take pictures and we see Chris entering the same place. 

Rui and Yusen are still ground rules, with Yusen insisting for Rui to put safety first, the latter puts down the condition that should Yusen loses, he will have to stop chasing Xiguang. Chris hears that and looks at the both of them, surprised. Yusen says that the race has nothing to do with his pursuit, and that Rui is being inappropriate ‘what if Xiguang hears about this?’ Rui hurries to tell him that it wasn’t what he meant! ‘Don’t you dare snitch on me’

[Haolin Han is also so expressive, I enjoy all his expressions.](https://i.redd.it/opmy9xeqrkag1.gif)

They continue bantering with Rui expressing interest in how unique Yusen’s snowboard is, the latter tells him he can get him a custom one too but our Rui is firm about ‘not accepting anything from you until you are officially Xiguang’s boyfriend.’ Off to the race! With Chris having heard the whole conversation. 

**Race Montage (basically an ad)** 

[Shared this as a video because Xiguang's voice is just adorable here.](https://reddit.com/link/1q0ixl6/video/nk8mdqssqkag1/player)

Xiguang is on the cable ride filming them from up high. Race montage done, we see Xigua asking who won? The winner is Yusen! By quite a gap, Rui expresses his desire for another go when he gets better and Yusen is happy to take him on whenever. Xiguang is all pumped and wants to try the black runs too. Rui makes fun of her and they argue in front of Yusen who is just grinning at their antics. Xigua tells them she will go practice on the green runs, Yusen offers to go with her but she refuses telling them to go have fun, that she is being considerate given the difference in their skiing proficiency. Yusen refuses saying that ‘tomorrow I can go off on my own but today I am sticking with you. We have a training plan’. Yusen is taking her to train on the blue runs.*I was so worried she’d be left alone to meet Zhuang Xu or something but nope. Not today!* 

Rui takes her aside to caution her to play it safe and not be all straight-up like before, Xiguang clarifies that they’re not dating yet. *Idk what she’s waiting for..* . They banter, she smacks him on the head and then abandons him to go off with Yusen. 

**On the Ride up the Hills**

Yusen wonders if he should’ve let Rui win, but Xiguang says of course not. Yusen explains that he did think about it but then he remembered that she named the race Xiguang Cup and abandoned the idea. *My man implying he would never let anyone else win her <3.* 

**Tea-time with the Moms**

[These locations are so so beautiful. ](https://preview.redd.it/g1q3l32zqkag1.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=05c9975310fc683483e10b886c18ef031876a701)

We see Weiai telling Jiang Yun about how this is the first time she’s seen Yusen care so much, about how he’s only ever cared about books and making plans for everything but romance. Jiang Yun expresses her surprise and Weiai sadly says that ‘the family influence got him too used to his own company’. The moms are getting along as they decide to let the kids make their own decisions. They each talk about their own lives and what they have been up to. Weiai says that she always felt that Jiang Yun had sharper instincts for business than her ex and we see her surprised to hear that. *Will we get to see her be all business lady by the end of the series? Please  I would love to see, especially as Xiguang’s dad has yet to impress me.*

**Resort Villa** 

Jiang Yun walks in on Xiguang practicing her ski skills by watching a video. She says she had tea with Yusen’s mom and that they enjoyed the conversation so much they ended up having dinner together too. *Uncle Luo was abandoned to his own devices.* 

https://preview.redd.it/23yy6il6rkag1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=e16ae9dc556ce07030c66e54d19d530cc975dcc9

As she is about to leave to shower, Xiguang asks her for her help with work. The problem constantly on Xiguang’s mind? The Phase II Plant garden. She explains the situation and her mom is happy to see her ‘all grown up and taking things seriously’. Xiguang playfully scolds her mom for always praising her for doing the work she’s supposed to, saying that ‘I didn’t end up spoiled thanks to my strong moral compass’. The mom teases her back then goes into professional mode as she gives her daughter solid advice. As her mom talks, we see Xiguang form a plan in her mind. Eventually, the topic of her dad comes up, and she tells her mom about how her dad has been missing payment. The mom theorizes the reason why and Xigua just says ‘I have no idea’.

Mom tells her about how she tried convinced her dad to invest in PV back in 2005 but he wouldn’t heed her advice and as a result they ended up missing the explosive wave of the PV industry. *This is to show us the business sharpness Weiai praised her for.* 

>If you are to run a business one day there is a paradox you must remember:business is inherently about chasing profit yet you must remain clear head amidst all the fame and fortune. *Something her dad lacks as all the family members keep hinting at.*

**Jiang Yun’s Room**

Mom is thinking about Weiai’s words to her. She also remembers her time with Chengyuan, we can see how wealth was changing Chengyuan, making him more short with her and how his inferiority complex was continuously getting them into fights. 

[Sculptor 4 acquired! ](https://i.redd.it/lq54suv9rkag1.gif)

**Back to Skiing!** 

Xiguang reminds them of their plan to do their own thing. They chat and we learn that : 1. Xiguang’s fam are leaving the resort in a day. 2. Yusen’s fam is leaving it tomorrow afternoon, with Weiai and Luo heading back to Switzerland and Yusen going to Beijing. They agree to all meet back up at 5.30 p.m. Yusen promises to treat them to hot pot.

**We cut to the Huaya Squad.** *Oh no, please drama just let the both of them move on.*  Chris and the other female colleague go ahead, leaving Xu to talk with Justin. *Naturally the show doesn’t hear my complaints as Justin opens his mouth and blabs “*I can see the guy who is chasing your student’s cousin, he looks like a total pro” Xu asks for clarification, and Justin confirms. THE EPISODE ENDS ON HIM COMING TO THAT REALISATION AND I AM MAD AT THE FACT WE ARE GETTING ONLY ONE EPISODE A DAY!!!!.

**Walk Counter:** Just 2. *The one episode I decide to start keeping track we don't have much.* 

**Overall Thoughts:** 

* I love how we get time to explore everyone's backstories. Both Weiai's last episode and Jiang Yun's in this. This episode just further feeds my growing dislike towards Chengyuan. 
* I am really enjoying the maturity with which the whole family deals with Xiguang's news about her relationship. 
* The way the episode ended doesn't bode well for me. I can't wait to go tackle episode 20 because my friends had some reactions. 

**We will be back to 2 episodes a day starting tomorrow!! Finally.**",4,1767203262.0,CDrama,0,1.0,False

* Do you have any cards you've been looking at?
   * Nope. SUBs or balance transfer needed
* Are you OK with category spending or do you want a general spending card?
   * I'm looking for anything to maximize benefits.

  
I guess I can use RH for my catch all with 3% and use the cash back as investments. I previously used the Amex Delta to get points towards future flights. If I spend 10k on the card in a year I get a $200 flight credit.

Sems like the Citi CC may be worth it for the 5% which could be for restaurants. If this will include all coffee shops, then would be even better.

Hope you had a great holiday. Remember when you sold me that Kraken Privateer a few years back? That was great. Since we're on the topic of the Kraken, I have a request. Please make the Idris as the loaner for Kraken(Privateer) since all the robots bought them this last IAE. I snagged a Kraken a few years ago before our new overlords started to slowly take over and gee it'd be swell to have the Idris as a loaner.

For breakfast I had oatmeal with 2 scoops of casein protein powder, pb2, bananas, and walnuts. Around 600 calories and at least 60g of protein. A lot of volume and fiber. Casein is also the slowest digesting protein.

Even with all that, I was hungry again about 2 hours later. I had 200 calories of chicken (about 20g protein) and about 2 cups of vegetables. Still hungry.

But this last months of year I started looking into the 9 year (which I don’t believe in) but still it made look back into the past and see how bad I am (emotionally) and how bad I felt like spiritual talking (full of guilt, regret and shame) so I started to connect the dots in my head and I realized one thing: getting stuff that does NOT come from God, comes with a price, and then I asked myself how could I let this happen? I’m bad at church, I can’t concentrate, I can’t pray so I wrote a letter to God, asking for forgiveness for putting my will on top of his, I asked him to broke any curse I have caused people, specially to my loved one, and mostly I asked to broke any pact or contract I had with the enemy that I can see it came into my life in a very dark time of my life, like a true predator, and now since I’m cutting all ties with him, I know he will come back but this time I asked God to let me be aware, that in my dark moments He will be my light, so this year I cut all ties to any sources that is not God, I asked his forgiveness and to protect these who I had hurt. 2026 is fully into His hands, and I beg you pray for me since I’m just starting back my journey to Christ and ask for the intervention of our Mother Mary, please even one time, gave me on your prayers cause I feel like I need many, thank you, happy new year and for these who start the journey back to Jesus, there’s many people like you, and I know He is happy to have us back🩷",2,1767203038.0,Catholicism,0,1.0,False

1q0isyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1q0isyh/i_feel_like_we_need_an_i_dont_know_flaire/,"I feel like we need an ""I don't know"" flaire...","This morning while I was peeing I heard a big crash upstairs. I didn't even wash my hands because my husband didn't respond when I called to him. I had put our big glass drink dispenser on top of the refrigerator when I was cleaning the kitchen and it had fallen off when he closed the freezer door and shattered everywhere. As I helped clean it up, he said sorry that it broke, then told me that I should've put it away. I said I guess and continued to get ready for work. When I came back to grab my coffee, he repeated, ""you should've put it away, right?"" I feel like he was just repeating it for me to accept responsibility for the thing breaking. I finally said, ""you could've put it away. I didn't want to put it back in the closet because I wasn't sure that it was dry yet and I didn't want it to get moldy."" Then I left for work. I don't care that the thing broke. I was thinking about getting rid of it because there wasn't really room for it. I just don't get why he was pushing like that.

He's been kind of anxious and depressed the last six months. The last couple of years have been rough as I have been a complete mess with my OCD, depression, and anxiety. He really had to step up with the girls and the house and his work was also just a clusterfuck during that time. It makes complete sense to me that it is his turn to have a menty-B. But it feels like instead of asking for reassurance or comfort like I did of him during my mental health crisis, he has become judgmental and demanding - maybe seeking control. The house is never where it meets his standards (we've worked together to make a cleaning schedule, but my newly acquired ADHD still makes it hard for me to stay on top of it). I drink too much soda. I spend too much money (the impulsive shopping that comes from the ADHD is kicking my ass and I am working to figure it out.) I buy too many snacks. I don't help with the kids enough and the kids watch too much TV (I work part time and am finishing up an associated degree). I don't want to have sex and we don't have it enough (sex is such a neutral thing to me. It has always been the PB&J of experiences to me. I could take it or leave it.) He keeps ""parenting"" me about being late to work (another ADHD time blindness thing I'm trying to work out).

I'm feeling the resentment starting to seep in and I hate it. I love and care about him and I want to stay with him. It feels like my perception of where I'm right or wrong is not reliable anymore. Our relationship seemed better when I was a SAHM and was very much in a support role to him. We were both raised in the Mormon church and left in 2020. I'm learning how to be myself and not just the baby-making machine and ""helpmeet"" I was taught to be growing up. I wonder if we're just having growing pains from all the struggles and changes going on.

He is in therapy and trying to get antidepressants figured out. We are going back to marriage counseling next week. I just want to feel accepted and trusted again. I want my best friend back.",4,1767202943.0,breakingmom,2,1.0,False

Based on recent community feedback, here's what locals are asking for:

**RESTAURANTS DOMINATE:** You want openings, specials, hidden gems, new menus, and ""does this place even exist yet?"" updates. As one reader put it: ""So few restaurants...and I want to know the moment one opens.""

**COMMUNITY GATHERINGS:** Parents, long-timers, newcomers - everyone wants more ways to meet neighbors. More events, more connection, more reasons to leave the house for something other than errands.

**EVENTS BEYOND LAKE TRAVIS:** Hill Country festivals, day trips, and good stuff beyond the bubble.

**REAL ESTATE WITH BALANCE:** Some want market trends, neighborhood developments, new roads, proposals. Others said ""please no real estate listings!"" - so expect a careful balance.

**LOCAL BUSINESS SPOTLIGHTS:** ""What about local small business promotions? Discounts? Services besides restaurants?"" - more of this coming in 2026.

1q0istk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1q0istk/twin_ectopic_pregnancy_advocating_for_yourself/,"Twin ectopic pregnancy, advocating for yourself and why it’s important to know wtf is happening to your body.","Going to open this by saying that my case is not what anyone would describe as a horror story, but I wanted to share to hopefully help other women going through something similar. I also added questions I wish I had asked once the rush of the news passed. I’m also giving a ton of details because when I was stuck in hospital I was craving detailed accounts.

Week before Christmas I discovered I was a pregnant, being so close to the holidays I decided to surprise my husband with the positive test. On the 23rd I woke with some pain and cramping. These were NOT the 10/10 pain that people typically describe with ectopic, I’d say a 6 at the worst. We walked our dog, grabbed a coffee and when I got home I laid down for an extra hour before work after taking some over the counter anti-gas medication - that’s how much of a non issue I thought this was.

We heat up lunch as we’re working from home together and it was such an average, normal day. I feel something in my pants. I checked and there’s scarlet red blood in my underwear. I go to the bathroom and again is not like the descriptions I hear. It’s in a grey area where it’s more than spotting but less than a period but I for sure thought I was having an early miscarriage. So I march into the kitchen and have to bluntly tell my partner in between tears that I was going to surprise him with a positive test but I thought I was losing the pregnancy. He sprung into action, called our GP who wanted me to come to the emergency clinic at the end of the day and instinctively I knew I had to see someone sooner than that. And I was right so please listen to your instinct ladies. I said we need to go to ER and luckily my husband did not question this at all.

It took us about 3 hours to be triaged. This part sucked. I was teary and emotional, had fever, chills, cold sweats, no cramping or bleeding but something was clearly wrong. We‘re in Canada so want to dedicate a huge fuck you to Doug Ford and the trashing of public health funding in Ontario, really, fuck you. Thank god once I told them what was happening things moved quickly. I was given an IV, had blood drawn and was registered and taken to the ambulatory straight away and saw a dr in the next hour. He checked whether this was a wanted pregnancy too, which I appreciated in term a of navigating what was happening emotionally. He explained that early miscarriages were common in the first trimester, nothing that you can do, no fault of anyone, etc. He tried an ultrasound but said it was unlikely to see anything with such an early pregnancy and not seeing anything was no news either way. As suspected he said he couldn’t see anything and I’d need an interior ultrasound. It could take a few hours. By this stage it was nearly 5, so I told my husband to go home, walk the dog and eat and keep him posted.

By this point I barely had any pain, I had a kitkat which was the first time I ate that day and waited. The interior ultrasound was when I knew something was very wrong. I was asked to pee beforehand and there was a lot of blood, I had for sure lost this pregnancy. I gave the tech a heads up and she gave me the usual warning that id get my results from the doctor, etc, etc. What you see in every film or series. One detail I thought was interesting: she asked if I wanted to insert the wand myself which I didn’t but it was a thoughtful question, and I know for someone knowing you can potentially ask for that might make the procedure easier. Either way as soon as it went in what followed was an extremely awkward appointment. I couldn’t see the screen but I could see her face and she spent a LONG time taking photos of my right side. A long time. And we both could feel the amount of blood sloshing around the wand every time she moved. She knew something was wrong, I knew something was wrong, we both knew the other knew but just didn’t say anything for the longest five minutes of my life. Bless her she even covered the wand with a towel when she pulled it out in case the blood was distressing to me.

This was when I really panicked. In my head I had hours to process the miscarriage but now I was worried about what in the fuck else they found in there and I was terrified it was a tumour. Ectopic didn’t even cross my mind at this point funnily enough even though it was that concern that made me want to go to ER. at just didn’t think I was in enough pain for it to be that. Back to waiting, luckily by this time my husband was back. By this stage I obviously knew the pregnancy was gone so I all I was hoping for was confirmation that there was nothing else and to go home and grieve a little before Christmas. God half of my husbands presents were pregnancy related and I had to deal with that when I got home.

The Dr pulled us into a side room after a few hours and broke the news. The ultrasound identified the egg had attached to my right fallopian tube causing an ectopic pregnancy, which was unfortunately non-viable. He also said it was actually a twin pregnancy which was very unusual and he had not seen before in a case like mine but a gyno was going to come in to speak to us for more details and course of action. The twin thing really hit us, we always joked about wanting a boy/girl twin pair so we could have two kids at once and be done with it. Up to this point I had processed that I had miscarried but somehow this made it real in a different way. It was like winning the lottery then being struck by a lighting. I was very worried about my husband who in a space of an afternoon discovered that I was pregnant, likely miscarrying, very unwell, and now had lost twins and was in some sort of danger. I think even now I’m going to struggle with my next pregnancy because its so unlikely to be twins again and I know I’m going to have to process the fact that a single pregnancy is right and enough. And yes right now there’s nothing to indicate that we won’t be able to conceive naturally, were very lucky.

The gyno came in a talked us through what was happening, I was 5 weeks and 4 days pregnant. With ectopics, the treatment options are a medication that essentially terminate the pregnancy or ipsurgical intervention. At this stage with an ectopic they’d normally attempt medication but in my case it was twins which made the ectopic mass quite large and made my hormone levels more elevated than usual his recommendation was surgically intervention. This would be the removal of the fallopian tube. That also completely shocked us, like a real gut punch. In my head immediately thought of the fact that fuck, I was now someone who would have fertility issues and problems conceiving. He was quick to point out that as long as the other fallopian tube had no issues, the impact to fertility is actually quite small as that tube can pick up eggs from the other ovary. Is that common knowledge? I consider myself pretty medically well informed and I had no idea that was the case. These five minutes were the biggest swing in emotions I have felt in a long time.

This moment for me was crucial and this is where I hope the post is most helpful to anyone in the same situation, because in the shock and blur of the situation I had so many doubts and concerns but nothing that was solidifying into concrete questions.

I asked him if we could try the medication before attempting surgery and he said because of the twin thing and the hormone levels he was not medically comfortable with that option - I wish I had pressed for more details here, not because I would have acted differently but because I actually had no idea of what was physically going on with me. He also said having an ectopic increases the chances of it happening again, and indicated that something was likely physically wrong with the tube, removing it would make the next pregnancy slightly safer providing the other tube was fine. It didn’t feel like we had any option so we agreed to the procedure. Here’s where things started going off the rails a bit but first I want to share a list of questions I wish I had asked at this stage:

\- What do the high hormone levels indicate and why is that a concern?  
\- What is my current condition? Is it stable? What indicates that it’a stable and how do we plan on tracking that?  
\- Is there any indication of any internal bleeding happening right now?  
\- How long can I safely wait for surgery and symptoms should I look out for to indicate something has worsen?  
\- Is the issue isolated to the fallopian tube? Once surgery is taking place is there a way to find out what caused it?  
\- Are we able to check for other issues that might have caused this like endometriosis?  
\- Are you able to check the health of the other tube and the ovaries when you are doing the procedure?  
\- How long is the procedure and can you talk me through it? What is the recovery process and length?  
\- Do I need any extra precautions for my next pregnancy and what are they? How quickly can we start trying again?  
\- Do we have time to get a second opinion?  
\- and this for me would have been crucial: how many ORs are available and what is the timeline for the procedure to take place?

The doctor brought the consent form and this is when we started being extremely vigilant because the form was for the removal of the healthy tube. Luckily I noticed it but the doctor made a passing comment that  they’d never remove the wrong one as they’d have to check the ultrasounds but let’s do it by the books and update the form. Yes fucking let’s eh? He explained that my urgency was ‘B’ so not requiring immediate surgery but fairly high up and he’d like to get the procedure done that evening and either way I’d be discharged by tomorrow evening at the very latest. At this point it was around 5:30pm so I had low hopes of same night surgery but he asked me to not eat or drink anything anyway.

Then we started to wait. And wait. And hours passed. At this point i was physically and emotionally drained, freezing cold, hungry and thirsty. We waited for around an hour and a half, I got up to go to the bathroom and by luck someone was calling my name in the main waiting area - meaning they had no clue where we were. They wanted to give me a drip when I got back from the bathroom. Cool I peed and let them know and around 30 minutes passed. My husband had gone to the station a few times and was told they had a room but it had to be cleaned, but that had not happened yet. The shifts had changed and they didn’t know who we were. They told him to go back to the room they were just going to make a call, but then time passed and no call had been made, and the call only happened when my husband was literally standing by the nurse as he rang. And there was no info. And nobody had been checking my vitals. And we asked again and then they had no idea who we were, what our case was and when my husband told them the ward and room being prepped for me and gave him the ward and number they asked him how they knew that. This is where knowing details of what the fuck was actually happening to me medically would have been useful. It was a hot mess, we ended up waiting hours and only started being moved to a room at around 9pm. I was so tired.

The ward nurse apologized and said she had no idea what the hold up had been they had been ready for me for hours. She said they would try to fit me that same evening but at around 11:30pm she told me the procedure had been cancelled because an emergency came in the ER  but I should expect to go into surgery at around 8am and it was a very quick discharge. Alas at least I was allowed to eat and never did a super-processed cheese sandwich and ginger ale taste so good.

One thing I want to point out here is that I never had issues with what are typical high pain procedures, like copper IUD insertion and removal. Same went for this, I know ectopic can be excruciating for some women but I don’t know if I’m just lucky, or have a high pain tolerance but I just wasn’t in pain any longer or felt anything extreme at any point. I say this because sometimes I find it really hard to judge whether something is actually wrong when I don’t relate to the extreme pain that is often described for these conditions. I also spent a lot of time thinking about the fact that I had mentioned to a few doctors that I always had felt this ’tug’ on my right side around my periods. It was different to a cramp and it didn’t happen often, it was kinda like a very sharp charley horse pain that you get on your calf? It was that, and I always had a feeling that it was… something worth checking, But my Pap smears were normal and no doctor had ever worried so I just ignored it too. And now I’m absolutely convinced it was in fact something more serious and I wish I had been more demanding in getting it checked and who knows. Maybe it wouldn’t have prevented this but it would have made me watch a pregnancy more closely.

I woke up at 6am and was allowed to drink for only about an hour and then a truly horrific day commenced. The new nurse was not very warm, which is fine, but our demeanour just didn’t click. The dr came in and I was able to ask a couple more questions but I was still feeling pretty out of sorts. He reassured me that the procedure was definitely happening today and it’d be a same day discharge so Id be home for Christmas, because oh yeah. All of this is happening over Christmas Eve, what a dream. We started to wait again and this was extremely difficult. Now that I was no longer dealing with the immediate emergency shock the emotional wave of having lost twins kept coming and going. I called my parents, my husband his to let them know, spoke with work and this morning was just hard. At around lunch we got a bit impatient with the lack of updates but I was also getting worried. My husband asked for information but again they promised they’d make calls that only took place once he stood there and waited for them to happen. We were also right by the nurse station and we overheard them bitching about another room and say in if they had a chance they’d prioritize them so they could be out of their hair. This paired with the mistake on the form the day before and the fact that they had basically forgotten us in ER and it being Christmas Eve had us worried that we were just kinda being overlooked.

The next time the nurse came in I very explicitly told her that I need more updates, I hadn’t eaten since the night before, we had no timeline even though I had been told the surgery should have taken place early morning and I was being  discharged that day, and I explicitly told her about the problems I had with the form and in the ER before so I was concerned about the level of care I was receiving. She just asked me who had given me that information and to not count on any of it: the surgery or the discharge and that was that.

A few more hours passed and nothing, I started getting pain on my left side which now I realize was probably just gas but hey that what it had felt like when I went to ER right? I was also aware that they had identified twins but who knows I know sometimes you end up with floating embryos in your pelvic cavity so I called for the nurse. She was pretty dismissive and just asked whether I was passing gas. Yes but I asked what symptoms should I look out for and she said unless my pain was 10/10 she wasn’t worried. I pointed out that even before the diagnosis the worse pain I felt was maybe a six so I wasnt sure about that yardstick so she just gave this exasperated sigh and said if I had heart pain to call her. By this point was early afternoon, my vitals were being checked semi regularly, but no checks on bleeding, pain, blood tests nothing. And we hadn’t been told what to expect or what was being done to monitor me so we had no way to judge if we were getting appropriate care or not. And of course I was dehydrated, hungry, cranky. My husband had gone out to eat and deal with dog and errands before everything closed for Christmas and he was fucking pissed with the whole situation. He marched over to the nurse station and finally was able to talk to a surgeon on the phone who filled us in. We were third on the operating list, the other surgeries were hips of varying complexities, but I was still on the list for that day. The slowness was because despite the size of the building , they only had on OR for the entire hospital.

That made us feel a bit better but she wasn’t able to speak for long. I slept, woke up, my vitals were still not being monitored, and by 6pm we had no additional information and we were getting upset again. A nurse we didn’t know came in with the wrong patient name and issue and started checking my bed and that was the straw that broke the camels back. For medical professionals I imagine that all of this seems routine and it was just a misread chart but I think sometimes its hard to out yourself in the patients shoes, were not used to this systems and process that are in place, and a combination of small issues and dismissals becomes concerning over a longer period of time.

My husband called my nurse again and we had a much more direct and terse conversation, where we basically said we had multiple times explained our concerns, asked to be kept informed, and we were still not getting anything. We were worried that the only thing that would escalate my care was my tube bursting but we didn’t feel confident that it would even be noticed if that happened, we had been given no parameters by which to know when something was wrong, no details on what made my situation stable or not, no information on the surgery, and directly said we were really struggling to navigate how to advocate for making sure we were getting appropriate care and not being difficult when we were sure she had multiple patient and likely more serious conditions to monitor. It felt like unless we were breathing down peoples necks nothing changed, progressed, was monitored or checked and we even asked whether we could look at transferring to a different Hospital. Sometimes with these discussions it feels like a video game dialogue tree where you have to hit the right combination of terms that forces an escalation and this is what happened here. I don’t what we said or if it was how we said it, whether it was saying we didn’t feel safe with the care we were receiving or inquiring about a hospital transfer, or advocating for medical care but suddenly the issue was escalated and within thirty minutes one of the surgeons actually came to the room.

It was night and day. She apologised profusely for the wait, she said her team was also frustrated and that she had time and she was at my disposal to answer anything. We once again explained what had happened the night before, said we had no parameters on what I should expect or what indicated I was stable and again were blunt in saying we were struggling with balancing making sure we are advocating for the right care and being difficult. By this point I was really teary and said look yesterday I was told this was an emergency, today theres no info, and right now I felt like even if things escalated whatever system is in place would not be able to cope with an emergency situation or even notice that is taking place. I told her about the pain on my left side and how my pain had not been extreme even pre diagnosis so I was genuinely concerned nobody would noticing it bursting, Again I don’t know what clicked but she then spend a lot of time talking about what emergency meant in my context, that there’s horror stories about ectopics but the mortality rate once its identified its very low, that I could be currently bleeding but a slow bleed was not a concern, the concern would be a burst and since I clearly had a decently high pain tolerance to flag any heavier bleeding, clots or any increase in pain. She said we could absolutely do another blood test if it help out my mind at rest and that she had pressed the OR and they said their best guess would be that the procedure would take place at around 10pm. Again, all information we had even asking for the whole day but was only given once we escalated things to a point that felt like it created this unnecessarily adversarial situation. How much easier this whole day would have gone if this had been the departure point versus something we had to fight for. The difference it makes to just feel like your case is being seen is enormous.

The rest of the stay was uneventful. The shift changed and I had a much better nurse, who immediately tracked my vitals more frequently, asked me to not flush or trash pads so she could keep an eye on my bleeding, brought some sponge sticks for my cracked lips since I hadn’t drunk water all day and was generally just much nicer and seemed to be more on top of things. At 10:30 I was taken to the OR. Unfortunately three women started labour at the same time so the team was pulled into that. I ended up waiting in the corridor for another three hours. At one point I asked them to let my husband know as I had been expected back in the room within an hour and I didn’t want him to fret.

Kudos to the nursing and OR staff. Some of them clearly were exhausted, two of them looked like they had serious mobility issues and were running around like crazy doing their absolute best in a hospital that is clearly underfunded and understaffed. Once again fuck you Doug Ford. At 2am they sprinted me to the OR, literally, so the procedure could start and they couldn’t be pulled elsewhere. It went fine. I was back in the room at 3am and my surgical notes indicated no cysts, endometriosis, a healthy uterus and ovaries and an externally healthy left fallopian tube - though they will be testing it for internal blockage, no internal bleeding at all and transfusion was not needed. I was out as soon as I showed I could eat and keep food down. It was Christmas Day.

In the interest of information, again, hoping it helps other women in the same situation. I didn’t feel a ton of physical pain the days after the procedure but I was tiring easily and the bloating was uncomfortable.The most severe pain was in my shoulder from the gas they use during the procedure travelling upwards. I got some bruising on the naval line below my belly button but nothing else around the incisions. Pain was manageable, I saved the opioids for before bed but only took it for two days, otherwise Tylenol was enough. The worse part was the constipation. I was prescribed daily hydralax but it was not enough. By day three I started chewing on fibre gummies, stopped the opioids, had a litre of prune juice, had senna and one tiny ball was all that moved. On day four I doubled the hydralax, kept the senna, kept the prune juice and gummies and texted my doctor who told me to get a glycerin suppository. This was the only thing that got things moving. This was also the day I had the most pain, maybe because the muscles and intestines were finally moving. I had the same level of pain that got me to ER and was having some large clots come out. We monitored the bleeding closely because it was heavy but not quite the amount that the discharged papers suggested required intervention.

Im well. I still need a follow up and tests to check my other tube, but we hope to be pregnant again soon. I hope the details help someone else in the same situation, specially anyone else who has a twin ectopic. I found that detail very painful and information or similar cases hard to find. I hope the questions I wish I had asked and the recovery details help someone. And more than anything I hope this helps show that even when you’re not an extreme case finding the balance of advocating for yourself and being a difficult patient is hard. I’m lucky to have a partner who was able to do a lot of the fighting when I felt like shit but women are often put in a position where we feel like we are being difficult. You are not, and you deserve and are entitled to information about your diagnosis, treatment plan and monitoring.

1q0iovn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1q0iovn/new_machine_question_about_default_output/,New machine question about default output,"Ok so I’m a complete espresso newbie but I’ve done a lot of research so I have a pretty good sense of the basics. 

I’ve been trying to dial in my shot on my new Premier series. Using fresh medium-dark beans. 

Grinder is giving me a consistent 18g of coffee grind. Prepping the puck with a WDT tool to avoid channeling. 

My main question is with the output weight. It seems to be nowhere near the default of 2.5:1. If I listen to barista assist I’m getting 20-22g out of a shot in about 45 seconds(from button push so it will be a little longer than traditional 30-32secs)I know barista assist is not perfect so I’ve gone one size coarser and I get around 36g in the same time. Which would be perfect except the default is supposed to be 2.5:1 so I should be getting closer to 45g of coffee. 

At 1 coarser then barista assist the shot seems dangerously close to being too runny and is not coming out thick and smooth. I fear going coarser would splatter the shot everywhere. 

Is the default set incorrectly? Is 2.5 actually 2.0?",1,1767202661.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,0,1.0,False

1q0if6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q0if6o/confessing_feelings_to_a_close_friend_and_wanting/,Confessing feelings to a close friend and wanting to stay friends after- looking for advice and stories from personal experience,"Hi everyone – I’m looking for advice specifically on **setting, timing, and delivery**, and also hoping to hear **personal experiences** from people who’ve been in a similar situation.

I 23F have had a close friendship with a male friend 28M for about 2 years. We’re in the same professional school, him a year above me and will be graduating soon, which means there’s a real chance we won’t see each other much after this year. We get along very well, talk about everything easily/comfortably, and I genuinely value this friendship. We're not best friends, but he's one of my closest guy friends. He's always reliable, considerate, thoughtful of his words/actions, and remembers all the small things I say.

Over time, I’ve realized I’ve developed feelings for him. He has never made an explicit romantic move, so I’m fully aware that he may not feel the same way — and I’ve made peace with that possibility. My priority is **protecting the friendship** and not putting him in an uncomfortable or pressured position.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

* I’m currently casually dating someone new (early stages, not exclusive), and it’s made me realize I don’t want to keep wondering “what if” with my friend, lose my timing, and have regret.
* I’m not trying to rush him, get an immediate answer, or force a decision — I just want to communicate honestly and leave the ball in his court.
* We don’t hang out one-on-one very often, so asking him to meet privately might feel unusual, but I also don’t want to ambush him or drop this at an inappropriate time.

**My questions:**

1. What’s the *best setting* for something like this? (in person vs walk vs coffee vs after an event vs letting him know in advance low pressure/not urgent that I have a question for him?)
2. Is it better to ask directly (“Do you think you could ever see us as more than friends?”) or gently frame it as something I’ve been thinking about vs directly telling him that I've liked him for X amt. of time?
3. For those who were rejected — were you actually able to stay friends? What made it work (or not)?
4. For men especially: how would *you* prefer to receive something like this from a close female friend?

I truly respect him and our friendship, and I want to handle this in the most thoughtful, emotionally responsible way possible — even if the answer is no.

Thanks in advance — I really appreciate any insight or personal experiences. Feel free to ask me any questions for more context.",2,1767201984.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

There are a few who do that but I can't find anyway who has their own remarkable brand. 

As coffee drinkers and espresso specially. Would you be a customer if that service is available to you and what do you think?

Depersonalization/derealization, tunnel vision, very bad sleep, also had physical symptoms like breathlessness/IBS/GERD for the same period.

Problems slowly went away after \~a month of abstinence, but instantly come back at full force when I take drugs again. I kept re-triggering this trauma over the year trying to see if I'm in a position to use stuff again and after a big ketamine dose am having the biggest flare up, took 2 full months to start being myself again, I had complete anhedonia (almost didn't listen to music or do anything sexual at all for this period, it's this bad). And now I'm back in this hell just because I started drinking coffee again. Tinnitus a lot worse too. Can't enjoy Christmas/NYE because of GERD. Weirdly it took 4 days of being back on coffee until I started having anxiety attacks, like there's a delay of a few days until it hit me, I didn't feel anxious at all while on the coffee.

I have preexisting anxiety disorder but it's mostly absent if some stress doesn't trigger it. Am writing this post in case other people have gone through sth similar or know how to go through it faster. Needless to say am quitting all drugs forever from now on. I have found that when progress with time feels slow, a session of intense physical exercise helps accelerate recovery a lot.

I tried to be compassionate, maybe this guy is stressed out too. Maybe he’s sad and he is doomscrolling. I should give him space. It’s whatever too I can just focus on my journaling and other sounds.

Then this guy started to look around. 

I looked at him and I thought this guy was just people watching. Okay fine I do that too.

Still he is just playing his phone videos super loud. 

I start to think of where I can move to just stay away from him, so he can just do his thing (maybe he’s sad and stressed out and this is what he is doing to calm down too idk).

Before I get up, the guy stands up. And I think he starts to video record me … while playing his videos out loud as like a cover.

Why. 

I tried to be kind, why. 

I become visibly angry and start throwing my book into a chair violently. 

The guy doesn’t look at me, but he looks like he was caught and needs to leave. 

I stare him down and start digging into my cptsd-well of pent up aggression and violence. What should I do. I will protect myself. 

I scan the environment and there is children around. Has he been video taping the children too? 

The guy quickly leaves. Gross. 

Now im mad and emotional, all I wanted to do was calm down at this coffee shop. Am I safe here? Should I still journal? I mean I guess at this point(?) 

But now my brain is conflicting inside me where it’s like idk did that guy actually video record me? I didn’t see it definitively. But my intuition and all the events that happened are like clues that he was. His behavior are pointing to that he was doing something he knew he shouldn’t be doing. And my brain and body were signaling that this guy was a threat.

Set up ran smoothly as per the instructions. The first 4 -5 espresso came out nicely. They could do with being a little more intense flavour wise, but not bad. Then the trouble starts. I've managed to get 2 more coffees in at least 20 attempts.

Most of the time the machine grinds, then attempts to pump. Nothing comes out. The machine aborts and tells me to run adapt bean. So I think. Maybe the adapt bean is grinding too fine. I adjust during the next brew. Then it dumps the grounds without brewing into the draw. I run adapt bean again. The same results, over and over again. I'm burning through beans and not drinking anything!

My husband and I are new to the Denver area and would love opinions on some areas we’ve explored for living in.

**About us:**

• Husband (30, M) and I (27, F) have 2 big dogs, no kids and don’t want kids in the future.

• We’re new to Denver so hoping to meet other people our age and find friends/community where we live.

• We don’t drink or smoke so night life and bar scene is not important to us.

• Enjoy hiking/walking so being close to trails and green space is important to us.

• We’re both in the healthcare field and looking for new jobs in west Denver and Denver city center.

• Enjoy being able to walk to coffee shops/restaurants - we don’t want to live by a ton of chain restaurants and have to drive 20 minutes to get to good food/things to do.

**What we’re looking for in a community:**

• Our budget is under 2,100 for 2 bed/2 bath house, condo, apt, or townhome

• We prefer west Denver for more suburbs-vibe but still want to meet people our age and be close enough to downtown to go to sporting events, restaurants, shows, etc.

• #1 priority is Safety

• We don’t wanna get stuck in a suburb area with a ton of older adults/kids. We’re looking for friends and community but don’t wanna be in the singles/bar scene either.

• Progressive and not conservative/religious

**Communities we’re interested in and would like your opinion on:**

• Old Town Arvada

• Bear Creek

• Marston Lake Area

We’ve even considered these areas:

• Green Mountain

• Sloans Lake/Edgewater

Any advice/opinions on this would be super helpful and greatly appreciated!!

I was trying to put together a mental list of Fae messing with mortals who hadn’t made any deals with them (or were otherwise involved in Fae business). So Harry doesn’t count, pretty much ever.

Not just Queens. Fae. Even the Little Folk. I can’t think of more than a couple times they weren’t targeting people involved with the Fae (Dresden) people who could be seen as tools for the working against the fae (team Dresden, alphas), changelings (I think they’re fair game), or just other Fae.

One I can think of is the troll from Restoration of Faith.

After months of work in the Phoenix Program since Shroud's defeat, Mandy has become rather distant lately and is planning something in secret, even from Robert. To what end? We are not certain, but all will become clear soon (probably in two more volumes after this)

In the meantime, the antics of the Z-Teamers continue. The stories are few in number for this session, but are more lengthy than the first volume, so hope you guys enjoy it. Happy New Year!

-----------------

**Lame-Ass Roommates (Invisigal and Blonde Blazer)**

Mandy: Alright, Visi, you understand what you need to do?

Courtney: Well, I've been spying on Robert all day, but spying on everyone else? This takes my ""pervert"" skills to a whole new level. I could get used to this.

Mandy: ***sigh*** For the third time, please don't spy on your fellow teammates in the showers, especially Robert. I just need you to keep an eye on the Z-Team and report back to me in writing.

Courtney: Ugh, *writing....*

Mandy: This is important, Visi. I swear this will all make sense once I have everything I need.

Courtney: You know, if we were still in college, Mandy, I'd be weirded out when the dork asked a cool girl like me to copy homework *from other dorks*. And that's without sucking them off and/or fucking them. It's usually the other way around.

Mandy: Don't be ridiculous, and drop the act. I know the 'real you' back in senior high, Courtney. We were both losers who suck at meeting new people, other than ourselves. Our lame personalities means we couldn't get a boyfriend, or even a prom date. Fuck, even sex is non-existent for us. Our only partners were two cases of Budweiser, a couch and a TV tuned in to ""Friends"".

Courtney: Could you *be* any more harsh?

Mandy: The point is, even if you hate to admit it, we're stuck with each other, which is why I helped you get into the Phoenix Program when you came to me a few months back. After you told me about your involvement with Shroud, and later, Robert... I couldn't stand by and watch my best friend suffer alone.

Courtney: And I can't thank you enough for giving me another chance. I know I screwed up, but I'm still glad that you always... Thank you, um-- again.

***Courtney went silent for a few moments, still thinking about the night that changed her life. She later regains her composure upon remembering what Robert told her before in the locker room, and what she did after that.***

Courtney: ... At least *I* have a boyfriend now, so it looks like the odds are in my favor. Don't worry, roomie, you'll get there. I know how much you fan-girl over Mecha Man, the ""real superhero"", so I promise I'll be gentle to him.

Mandy: ***sigh*** Courtney....

Courtney: You can count on me, Amanda. I won't let you down again.

***Invisigal disappears and heads to the break room, leaving Mandy alone in her office, smiling***

Mandy (*Inner Thoughts*): (*I do hope Visi will keep this under wraps. I don't want Robert or the rest of the team to see me as some evil, corporate schemer after this. People mistook me for that before, for some pointless reason.....*)

(*....""****Amanda****""... I haven't been called by that name in a long time...*)

------------------

***By this point, safely assume that Invisigal is present in all other scenarios***

------------------

**Firebird (Flambae and Phenomaman)**

Flambae: Hey, Phenoma-dick-bitch!

Phenomaman: Ah, are we doing nicknames now? Hello there, Chad. How are you--

Flambae: Don't fuck with me, fucker! You owe me $2,000 in repairs.

Phenomaman: Repairs? I do not understand. I believe that *all* of us were responsible for the damages to the SDN Torrance branch during Shroud's terrible attack, so it is logical that you also have to pay--

Flambae: Not the office, you dumb fuck! I meant the repairs for my customized Pontiac Firebird that you made into your bed a few months, you inconsiderate, busty-ass, asshole!

Phenomaman: Oh, that.... I.... I... apologize, ..... I didn't mean to... Oh no.... I will.... Phenom--

Flambae: What the hell, man? Where are you going?

***Phenomaman wandered off and fell down on his knees, entering into a state of deep depression. Flambae then kicks the inactive hero with no response***

Flambae: ***facepalm*** ... *Phenomenal*.

-----------------

**Meet the Robertsons, Part 2 (Mecha Man, Malevola and Coupé)**

***Crypto-Night, 10:30PM, in a secluded table at the corner of the bar. Robert had just finished the story on how he lost his old Mecha Man suit in detail***

Malevola and Coupé: ...

Robert: You guys alright so far? Am I explaining it too fast.

Malevola: No, not at all, Robert. It's just a lot...a whole fucking lot. Fuck the Red Ring, seriously.

Coupé: ... To think that Invisigal worked with the Red Ring longer than when we knew her, and being indebted to them because of the augments they grafted on her chest. Now I fully regret working with them. And I also regret, you know, literally cutting you, Robert.

Robert: I've had worse, trust me.

***All three take one glass of whiskey*** ***at once***

Coupé: And you guys say that I was heartless back in my assassin days, Shroud is definitely an asshole for turning back on his deal with Visi. If I was in Robert's position, I would've killed him myself without hesitation.

Malevola: Yeah, but that wouldn't be ""heroic"" now would it?

Robert: And despite everything that happened that night, I still forgave Visi in a heartbeat, for the same reason why I would forgive you all, given the chance. We're in the Phoenix Program for one purpose, guys: *To burn up who we were to become who were meant to be*.

Coupé: Well said, ""Mecha Man"".

Malevola: I'm just gonna ask this question again, 'cause, damn. Robert, are you cool?

***Invisigal uncloaks besides Robert, startling him and their two co-workers***

Courtney: No, he's not. Robert just looks cool cause he's all brooding in a corner like Han Solo, or someone like him.

Robert: Gah-- Goddamn it, Courtney. You couldn't wait for me to come back home?

Courtney: Nah, dude, I can't stand being alone with your dog for so long. No offense to Beef, but even *I* want pets and belly rubs.

Robert: Jesus Christ, I've only been gone for an hour.

Courtney: ....Which translates to two weeks in dog years.

Robert: ***sigh*** That's not how dog years work, and you know it.

***Coupé and Malevola chuckle discreetly, enjoying the very wholesome banter between the two obvious lovebirds. The banter then ends with Rob and Courtney kissing***

Courtney: I missed you.

Robert: I know, I missed you too.

Coupé: ***sob*** This is beautiful. Clingy, but beautiful.

Malevola: Fuck, now I'm getting all sappy again from seeing you guys kiss. That was romantic.

Courtney: Not as romantic as that makeout sesh we did back at the locker room, right Robbie?

Malevola and Coupé: ***gasps***

Courtney: Oh, you didn't tell them yet...

Robert: I was getting to that, Visi.

Malevola: BARTENDER! We need more drinks!

---------------

**Bat-Shit Crazy (Sonar and Golem)**

***Golem returns from his dispatch, acting very suspicious as he seemingly has a box full of staplers attached to his muddy construct body. He approaches Sonar, lurking in the corner of the bullpen.***

Sonar: ***\*whisper\**** You have the staplers?

Golem: ***\*whisper\**** You have the drugs?

Robert: You have ten seconds.

***Robert had followed Golem the entire time, arms crossed***

Sonar and Golem: ***\*visible shock\****

----------------

**Punch-Drunk Love (Mecha Man, Punch-Up and Phenomaman)**

***Robert enters the break room and sees Punch-Up tending to a very ""flat"" Phenomaman on the floor***

Robert: Shit, how bad is it?

Punch-Up: He's out cold, lad. This sad horse is depressed since yesterday. He was staring upwards without blinkin', the floor littered with empty Guinness bottles. Things got worse after Golem gave Dumpy his ""gummies"" earlier, if you know what I mean.

Robert: ***deep sigh*** For fuck's sake. Give him some coffee, it'll cure his depression. Don't ask me how that works.

Punch-Up: Tried already, he still won't budge. Don't worry, Rob, I gave him instead some Poitín laced with Valium. That should wake him up.

Robert: Colm, I doubt *more* alcohol is the solution to-- Wait, did you say ""Valium""?

***Phenomaman instantly reccovers and stands up. He sees Robert, but in an provocative manner***

Robert: Oh, god, what is happening?

Punch-Up: Relax, lad, he's an alien. I don't think a lil' dose of Valium is gonna kill him. Plus, he's up now.

Robert: That's the thing, Punch-Up, he's an *alien.* There's no telling what Valium could do to his physiolog--

***Before Robert can finish speaking, Phenomaman ""made love"", squeezing him tight. What came out of his mouth next deeply disturbs the two heroes***

Phenomaman: Ah, Blonde Blazer, my love....

Punch-Up: ***\*bursting with muffled laughter\****

Robert: Uh, Phenomaman-- Ugh-- STOP!-- Snap out of it-- You're hallucina-- Damn, this is tight!

***Just as Phenomaman was about to kiss Robert, the corner of the former's eye had noticed Punch-Up, who is still laughing at Robert's embarrassment***

Phenomaman: **\*gasp\*** No! A Loraxian Thot! I thought these are only native on my planet!

***Phenomaman lets go of Robert***

Phenomaman: I will not let you harm my beloved, foul creature. Stand aside, Blazer! I shall deal with the imminent threat!

***Phenomaman grabs Punch-Up***

Punch-Up: Whoa, big man, I'm not an alien!

Phenomaman: ***BEGONE, THOT!!!***

***Phenomaman throws Punch-Up through the window of the break room and is sent flying for a couple of miles***

Phenomaman: Ahh, and so the world is safe once again! Phenoma-ma-ma-ma....

***Phenomaman faints and falls down once again. Robert is confused as to what transpired***

Robert: Well.... shit.

Galen: Uh, Robert, we got several calls involving a huge crater near the hospital.

Robert: ***sigh*** I'll get my suit.

1q0i8wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/real_anti_racism/comments/1q0i8wh/scramble_for_africans_2/,Scramble for Africans 2,"(This is the second of what will be 3 posts summarizing Howard W. French's book, Born in Blackness, all followed by a separate post with the relevant bibliography. Each entry starts with the page number or numbers in French's book on which it was found.)

105 the first known example of the trade in slaves to the Akan for gold was in 1479 or 1480, when a woman from Sierra Leone and her son were purchased there for a basin and 3-4 brass bracelets (*manilhas*) and sold at Elmina four 14 gold weights; the guy who did this was imprisoned by the Portuguese at Elmina, and while he was there he said he saw 200 slaves arrive from further east for sale to the Akan (Bato'ora Ballong-Wen-Mewuda 1993)

106 the Bini kingdom at the time came to be known to contemporary Europeans as Benin, but it was not where contemporary Benin lies, but in Nigeria, and it was nothing like the small territory ruled by the Akan, which was surrounded by larger (but still fragmented) ""Akan statelets."" Benin at the time was ""the preeminent power of the time,"" with 10,000 miles of walls, a highly centralized government, regulated trade, a police system, and an army that could field 100,000 soldiers (McClelland 1971)

106 their kings were styled *oba*, and they controlled economic affairs through royal guilds that oversaw the production of arts and high-value commercial products like textiles (Seligman 2006)

106 the Europeans soon saw the potential for trade in a local savory pepper available in the Benin capital of Gwaton, but slaves were still their primary target, and the Bini had a ready supply of these from the wars it engaged in (nr)

106 in 1486 Benin sent an embassy to Lisbon (two years before the previous embassy by the Jolof) (Northup 2014)

107 a slave sold at Gwaton in 1500 would have fetched 12-15 *manilhas*, but the price rose over time (Garfield 1992)

108 a transformation in subjectivities began, as Portuguese began appearing in Benin art and Africans began appearing in European art (Nafafé 2007)

108 for the first few years of the Benin trade, only 300 slaves a year were sent to Elmina; but the men there wanted more badly, and had to have them to compete with Akan's established connections with the trans-Sahara trade routes (Wilks 1982)

108 they soon prevailed on the organizers to dedicate 3 more ships to the Benin trade, and at its peak, the profit from the sale of slaves was 15% of their profits from the gold trade (Vogt 1973)

109 An oba of Benin displayed some interest in conversion to Christianity if the closer relationship with Europeans would make it more likely they would be able to buy guns, for use in quarrels with their rivals, the neighboring Idah; but this came to nothing, as Benin defeated their rival without the guns and the oba who started the effort died (Northup 2014)

109 in 1514 Benin began restricting the slave trade, and the Portuguese had to close their feitoria at Gwaton. And the author makes the point: the Portuguese were not at all prepared to try to compel Benin to sell slaves to them (Hartman 2007)

\*294 the reason Benin had shut down the slave trade in that area was because Lisbon had refused to provide cannons ""unless and until this West African kingdom could prove its Christian bona fides."" (Ryder 1969)

110 ultimately this region did become one of the most prolific sources of slaves to the Atlantic trade, between 1675 and 1725; but at this point that was far in the future (nr)

112 by 1510-1520 Portuguese attention had shifted from getting slaves from Benin to Ghana to ""fully colonizing"" the then uninhabited island of São Tomé(nr)

112 the island was discovered in 1471, declared a colony in 1485, and Portuguese and Spanish experience colonizing islands had taught them how much money could be made (for example) by planting sugar (nr)

112 but their immediate goals were 1) to provision the fort at Elmina, 2) to use it as a way station in the supply of slaves from the continent to Elmina, and 3) to produce sugar to supplement their Madeira output, which had been very profitable but which was going into decline (due to using up the soils) (nr)

113 a fourth purpose was providential: in 1492 Spain expelled its Jews, who streamed into Portugal, and who may have amounted to 10% of the Portuguese population at one point; they were given the choice of converting or leaving the country, and up to 2000 Jewish youths, newly converted, were sent to the island to get the colony going economically (Garfield 1992)

114 Lisbon took care to also supply African women for the colonists, with an eye to breeding more colonists (nr)

114 São Tomé began sending its first shipments of slaves to Elmina before 1500; most of these seem to have come from Benin, but by 1540 Kongo was a leading source of slaves, who were by then headed not just to Elmina but also to Lisbon and Seville and the ""New World"" (nr)

115 slave trading with Kongo was so lucrative that Europeans who had been sent to São Tomé immediately began trying to escape the island to get to the mainland and set up in trade for themselves (nr)

115 by the 1520s the island was importing 2000 slaves a year from the mainland, and shipping about 1/4 of them on to Elmina, the rest going to the New World or to Europe (Garfield 1992, Vogt 1973)

115 Elmina deserves a much more prominent place in history for its supply of gold to Europe, buoying Portugal's currency, helping accelerate European economic integration, helping fuel a continent-wide price revolution (an era of steady growth and moderate inflation after a long period of stagnation) (nr)

115 São Tomé should also have a different kind of credit, as the ""last stop"" for sugar cultivation in the eastern hemisphere. It began in prehistory in New Guinea, moved to India and then the Near East, then (during the Crusades) to the southern extremities of Europe, then the Canaries and Madeira, which had much larger plantations than anywhere in Europe of the time (Curtin 1990)

116 they were distinct also in the regimentation of their labor, in the large numbers of workers, and in the number of specialized roles, making them an ""early seed"" of the intense division of labor that is associated with the beginnings of industrialization (Mintz 1985)

116 but it is in São Tomé that we first find the perfectly racialized division of labor never deviated from later (Caldeira 2011)

117 the output of São Tomé plantations soon experienced the steepest ascent in output of any food crop in human history (Mintz 1985)

117 São Tomé was also the site of some of the first slave revolts, including one that may be called successful (nr)

121 but once its soils gave out it gave way to Brazil as the world's capital of sugar production

122 sugar was first launched by the Portuguese in Madeira in 1425, where production peaked at 300,000 arrobas per year; when São Tomé was established, Madeira was down to 120,000. By 1530 São Tomé had surpassed Madeira to become the chief supplier of sugar to Lisbon. In 1555 there were 60-80 sugar mills on the island, producing 150,000 arrobas, and production was rising steeply. 12,000 Africans worked the land and the mills, doing work so arduous that constant resupply from the mainland was required. (Garfield 1992)

122 on their one day off a week, these Africans had to produce their own food for themselves (ibid)

122-3 the slave plantation complex developed on São Tomé would have far more economic significance than the ""expansionary pursuits"" of Spain over the same time period. Spain's silver and Brazil's gold petered out (Potosí went dry by 1700, and Brazil's gold boom wound down by the end of the 1800s); slavery and the slave plantation system continued to produce, and was emulated by others, as well. (Arana 2019)

123 plantations operating under near-slave-like conditions would not be extirpated, including in São Tomé and Cuba, until well into the 20th century (nr)

123 the same plantation model was used both for Big Sugar and for Big Cotton, the two most significant mass agricultural developments in modern history, with ""the line that connects them"" running also through indigo, tobacco, rice, coffee and cacao (nr)

123-4 the question arises: why were plantations not built on the African mainland? There was plenty of land there suitable for sugar, cotton, and all the plantation crops between. Part of the answer is disease, and its effect on European colonists; for some reason, when Europeans went to Africa it killed them, but when they went to the Americas it was the indigenous that died.

125 even as late as the 19th century, the literacy rate of enslaved Muslim Africans was often higher than that of their owners in the Americas -- and thus, the further the Portuguese explored Africa, the fewer differences they saw, between what they found and where they were from. (Curtin 1964)

125 but the author's result is, the Africans were too ably militant for the Portuguese to feel they could establish and maintain mainland plantations (nr)

126 not to mention it's hard to escape from islands, and revolts are much more easily suppressed (Williams 1944)

126 not to mention that if all the slaves are black and all the blacks are slaves, it's a lot harder to blend

137 Frederick Douglass anecdote about his interview with an apparently happy slave: ""Tell me then what part of your work is most pleasant."" She answered with much emphasis, ""No part pleasant. We forced to do it."" (Douglass 1848)

138 Elmina in the early 1500s had become a mix of 15-20,000 not just blacks and whites but of Creoles (Berlin 1996)

139 in the 1490s Kongo sent the children of its nobles to Lisbon, where special schools were provided for them to learn Latin and theology (Hatton 2018)

139 by 1761, when Lisbon banned the importation of slaves into its territory, 400,000 Africans had been brought there in bondage, and yet no Creole was created there (nr)

141 he implies, without stating, the part in quotes (the rest he states): ""all over the slaving world"" Creoles became the grease that made the commercial and social machinery function. This was as true in colonial America as anywhere else. There Ira Berlin called them the ""charter generation"" (Berlin 2004)

141 Creole communities formed in what would become Haiti, in Cartagena, Havana, Mexico City, and San Salvador (nr)

142 recent scholarship has shown the importance of west Central Africa in the formation of Creole identities far greater than anything Berlin suggested (Candido 2015 and Mobley 2015)

143 and even more important: the creation of a partly (and in some places, almost completely) black new world changed the Europeans who made it too: they were no longer Europeans, when they were done. This was ""the most powerful engine of modernity there's ever been."" (author's own)

147 here begins Chapter 14, and I had a hard time making sense of it. Here are the clearest allegations:

148 the 1884 Scramble for Africa was preceded by a centuries-long Scramble for Africans, which began with Portugal's construction of the fort at Elmina (nr)

148 by the 1600s intra-European competition for labor for plantations had fueled a quasi-world war, fought simultaneously on opposite sides of the Atlantic, by shifting alliances of Europeans, African states, and Brazilian allies and proxies. This was a forgotten but critical part of the Thirty Years' War (nr)

148 this contest for the South Atlantic was followed by an interminable war over the Atlantic's most coveted sea: the Caribbean (nr)

148-9 in 1653 Oliver Cromwell tried to capture Santo Domingo and, unable, took Jamaica as a consolation prize. Jamaica soon surpassed Barbados as the world's biggest sugar producer (nr)

149 by 1660 England was the largest shipper of slaves across the Atlantic, and by 1700 accounted for nearly half the entire Atlantic traffic; its exports to Africa rose commensurately, increasing 10x over the 1700s (Eltis 2000, Richardson 1979)

149-150 the Dutch and Spanish were increasingly sidelined ""from the enormous wealth that flowed from sugar and slavery,"" and this left France and England to fight it out over the Caribbean (nr)

150 this was not a contest for territory in the naive sense, but for very specific territories that rewarded the holders of it immensely: the territories from which labor was extracted, the territories on which it could be put to use (nr)

151 even the French and Indian War should be understood as a struggle to control a base from which Britain could much more easily supply its outposts in the Caribbean (Baugh 2011)

151-2 Pitt's rise to power in the UK in 1757 led to a plan to attack both the French sources of supply of slaves, in Africa, and their wealth-producing island in the Caribbean, and the next year his navy seized the French slaving centers in Senegal and Gambia. They were then directed to attack in the Caribbean, with their original goal the island of Martinique. This island was too well defended, and the navy attacked Guadeloupe instead. Once they captured it, they imported more slaves in the next two years than France had over the entire 18th century. The number of mills on the island jumped from 185 to 447, and in 1761 it ""led the British Empire in exports of sugar, cotton, rum and coffee, as well as in its purchase of British and American products."" (Trouillot 1995, Burnard and Garrigus 2016, and Dubois and Turits 2019)

153 it was claimed as early as 1938, by Eric Williams in his Oxford doctoral thesis (later expanded into his classic text, Capitalism and Slavery, that ""without Africa, and the slave plantation agriculture of the Caribbean"" there would never have been the explosion of wealth that the West enjoyed in the 19th century (Williams 1944 and Carrington 2003)

154 ""dozens"" of British historians worked to disprove Williams' thesis, arguing that the sources of British wealth, instead, were machinery, shipping, and liberal banking laws (Nelson 2015)

155 Williams' arguments had flaws: he was not a trained economist, his methodological framework was archaic, and he didn't show the ""deep mastery of data and statistics"" that the topic required

156 Williams' most successful critics have focused on his proposition that Britain acted to abolish slavery only after determining that the slave plantation model was no longer economically successful; in fact the abolition of the slave trade occurred at its very peak (Eltis 2000)

156 the 1807 ban came about not actually from revulsion at the practice of slavery, but out of a crisis of imperial legitimacy, which in turn was largely sparked by America's successful revolution. In addition, reformist Islamic movements then ""sweeping West Africa"" and fighting the slave trade made the pretense of Christian benevolence, in the practice, less competitive; and France's loss of Haiti removed the competition with France, over the slave trade (nr)

158 it was empire that made the British state, not the other way around (Cooper 2014)

160 in 1637 the Dutch finally brought an end to Portuguese monopoly of the Gold Coast, by taking the fort at Elmina; shortly afterwards they conquered São Tomé and Luanda as well (Vogt 1979)

161 prior to these assaults, the Dutch had been predating on Portuguese shipping to the amount of 5 tons of gold a year, and it was this wealth that allowed them to mount their final offensives (Vogt 1979)

162 the Dutch struggle to free themselves (as Protestants) from the Catholic dominance of the unified (since 1580) Spanish/Portuguese crowns, which claimed The Netherlands as their territory, stood behind all this as well (nr)

178 ""The Caribbean still lies ahead in our story, but once sugar took off there, two thousand or more slaves per integrated plantation was not uncommon"" (nr)

178 ""Only in the mid-nineteenth century would the largest factories begin to approach the scales of late eighteenth-century plantations. Josiah Wedgwood's famed pottery works, which some historians have described as the largest industrial factory of its time, employed only 450 people at his death in 1795. In Britain, most textile mills in Lancashire employed fewer than 500 hands."" (Rosenthal 2018)

179 in the late 1500s in Brazil began ""one of the most spectacular events in the economic history of the early modern Western world,"" that is Brazil's sugar century. Starting in 1570, by 1580 production was up to 180,000 arrobas (3x the output of Madeira and São Tomé combined); by 1614 it was up to 700,000 arrobas, ""orders of magnitude greater"" than those small islands, and it would soon reach 1 million arrobas (Blackburn 1997)

180 one historian has estimated that at this time, the costs of operating the Brazilian colony yielded profits to the Portuguese crown of 50% more (Schwartz 2004)

181 by contrast, the Spanish New World mines yielded three to five million pesos' worth of silver a year, which were shipped annually to the Ming Dynasty in return for silk, porcelain, tea, and other goods. (Godinho 1963)

182 there is little doubt that the immense windfall Spain enjoyed from its mining had a profound impact on world economic history, ""binding East and West together more tightly than ever before."" Less widely noted was a ""prolonged 18th-c boom in gold production in Brazil"" -- again, made possible with African slave labor (Smith 1902)

183 Brazil's sugar crop, which by itself accounted for 40% of Portugal's total revenue, generated more income than either Spanish silver or Brazilian gold. And slavery-driven sugar production also had far more extensive and deeper connections to other productive sectors of Western economies. (Schwartz 1985)

184 and this is why the Dutch were successful in kicking the Portuguese out of Elmina and São Tomé(not to mention Malacca, Colombo, and Kochi and Kannur, key ports in the spice trade): Brazil was simply worth more, and Portugal had limited defensive resources. They managed to hang onto Brazil and Angola, and those were the vital pieces of their puzzle.(Cagle 2018)

185 despite all this, ""the epicenter"" of Atlantic sugar began to shift back to the Caribbean islands. In the early 1600s, Spain had locked up the major islands; Barbados (British) and St. Martin (French) were consolation prizes, and viewed at the time more for their strategic value, as places to potentially mount attacks from, and resupply, than for economic use. (nr)

186 and because the islands lay south of the Tropic of Cancer and west of the mid-Atlantic, they were not referred to in European treaties, and so anything went, and usually did -- piracy, freebooting, privateering, poaching. (Williams 1971)

186 the first agriculture the British attempted, on Barbados, was tobacco, indigo, and cotton; but the good quality tobacco available from Virginia, combined with the rising price of sugar and instability in Brazil, due to Dutch predation, persuaded the Barbadians to try sugar instead (nr)

187 by 1636 Barbados was in a full fledged sugar boom

187 here the author alleges that Barbados' black code (legal) made it a ""driver of history"" apparently because other jurisdictions copied it, probably having (as I see it) better things to do than to think up their own

187 in 1642 there was an uprising against the Dutch (who had temporarily kicked the Portuguese out of Brazil) by locals who remained strongly loyal to the Portuguese, and the Dutch had to back out and go elsewhere (some of whom famously then came to what was New Amsterdam, and founded the oldest Jewish congregation in what was to become America) (nr)

189 key to the British success in Barbados was its positioning of its American colonies as suppliers to the colony (Mulcahy 2014)

189 no part of the American mainland was bootstrapped more dramatically than New England; by the 1680s, more than half the ships anchored in Boston's harbor were there for the West Indian trade (Warren 2016)

191 but it was really the war between the Portuguese and the Dutch that provided Barbadian sugar the boost it needed to compete effectively (nr)

194 not to mention that the English planters soon decided that their best profits lay in thoroughgoing integration of all the processes, and apparently they were right about this (nr)

194 state-sanctioned raiding and piracy of the ships of rival European nations, begun in 1660 under the aegis of the British Company of Royal Adventurers, turned out to be so lucrative that it resulted in the invention of the guinea as a British monetary unit, which however since 1967 is no longer in use (nr)

195 the original goal of the Company was to supply slaves to Barbados at 17£per head, and between 1663 and 1666 they landed 5000 slaves at 18£per head, just missing the mark; in the 1660s over 32,000 slaves were delivered. But far more important in the long term was that the British broke the Dutch ""stranglehold"" on the African slave trade (Beckles and Downes 1987 and Mulcahy 2014)

195 by the end of the next 150 years, Britain would ship more slaves to Africa than any other entity (Pettigrew 2013)

198 more than has been recognized, slavery contributed to the emergence of political parties, Tories and Whigs; to the growth of London as a financial center; to the blossoming of British power and prosperity (Pettigrew 2013 and Miller 1999)

202 One Barbadian planter had 327 slaves, and he calculated on a mortality rate of 10-16 per year (3-5%) (Thompson 2009)

206 author makes the point again that these sugar plantations are probably the best place to look for the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, in their division of labor, specialization, and careful synchronization (nr)

208 the takeoff of Barbadian sugar in the 1600s stood out against the European backdrop of downturns across the board -- in Spanish New World silver (by 1620), in the Baltic grain trade, in northern European woolens, in French wine (Blackburn 1997)

208 in 1655 England seized Jamaica, and re-created the Barbadian experience there, ultimately shipping 1.2 million slaves to the island (SlaveVoyage statistic, from https://slavevoyages.org/estimates/pVr7i5)

209 but France was a close competitor, and Saint Domingue (Haiti to be) overtook Barbados as the biggest sugar producer between 1725 and 1750 (SlaveVoyage statistic, from https://slavevoyages.org/estimates/E1PNmWdH)

210 textiles were about to become the most important product of the industrial age, and the Dutch made their own copies of the Indian cottons the Africans loved so much, to sell all along the coast of Africa (nr)

210 one of the most important markets for English textiles was as clothing for slaves (Blackburn 1997)

210 the British also helped the Portuguese throw the Dutch out of Brazil, and their reward was open markets for their goods in Portuguese Brazil (Carnota 1843)

211 Barbados and other Caribbean sugar colonies were a lifeline for the struggling American colonies before their victories over Great Britain, since English markets were previously closed to them for many products, but they could sell in the Caribbean (Williams 1944)

212 the estimated annual per capita income of whites in Jamaica in the 1770s was 35x that of those in what would become America (Mulcahy 2014)

212 in the 1500s the Atlantic slave trade amounted to 370,000 persons; in the 1600s it was 1.8 million; in the 1700s, 6 million (Blackburn 1997)

212 of the colonial shipping trading to Barbados in 1686, 80% of the tonnage was registered in New England, and more than 1/3 in Boston (Hornsby 2012)

213 a ""powerful contribution"" to our understanding of how Great Britain surpassed China as the world's richest nation has been made by Kenneth Pomeranz. He says there were two main factors: first the ecological dividend, the windfall Europe reaped by taking over the Americas in an astonishingly short period of time, second the expropriation of African labor (Pomeranz 2000)

213 he points to the dietary boost Britain got from this avalanche of sugar, too, which ""fueled the long, intense workdays of England's early industrial mill laborers"" (Pomeranz 2000)

213 it has been estimated that by 1800 Britain was subsisting on the labor of a million slaves, and had stolen about 2.5 billion hours of labor from them (Blackburn 1997)

214 the influx of sugar didn't just power workers through their days in Britain, it also paved the way for the popularity of otherwise bitter drinks containing caffeine, like coffee, tea, and cacao, and reducing a previous dependence (for, it is claimed, health reasons) on ale, and thereby shifting the entire population from downers to uppers (historian Randy M. Browne, currently at Xavier University in Cincinnati, personal communication w/ author)

215 the avalanche of sugar had an impact on society too: these new drinks gave birth to the coffee shop, which invited unreligious congregation and the reading of newspapers, and ultimately the invention of what we now call civil society and the modern public sphere (Stephens 2007, Schudson 2019, and Cowan 2005)

216 all this seems to reveal that the Enlightenment itself ""had vital roots"" in slavery. Pomeranz demonstrates pretty clearly how irreplaceable this sugar avalanche was, by pointing out that in sheer calories, an acre of sugar was worth 9-12 acres of wheat, and that therefore the calories consumed in the UK about 1800 would have required from 1.3 million to 1.9 million acres of average British wheatlands to replace them. By 1831 the numbers would have risen to from 1.9 million to 2.6 million acres. But the land that then remained uncultivated in Europe was hardly the best, and so conceivably it would have needed much, much more land even than that. (Pomeranz 2000)

216 the same kind of logic works with textiles, too: by 1815, Britain imported 100 million pounds of New World cotton, and by 1830 it was 263 million pounds. Replacing cotton with hemp or flax wouldn't have required too much more land: 200,000 acres in 1815, 500,000 in 1830. But they gave inferior textiles, requiring much more arduous labor to produce, and so large scale production had not yet been achieved in either England or North America. (Pomeranz 2000)

1q0i831,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q0i831/what_i_saw_when_i_could_no_longer_see/,What I Saw When I Could No Longer See,"I went blind on Christmas Day. As much as I’d like to pin the blame on someone else, as much as I’d like to blame my father-in-law who complained nonstop about how dinner was going to be late, the buck stops with me. But, really, who knew that a not-fully-thawed turkey, too much oil, and propane turned up full-blast would act like a bomb? Jonah, my twelve-year-old, that’s who. While we waited for the ophthalmologist in the ED, I heard a YouTube video on my son’s phone, then heard him say to his mother, “Dad should’ve watched these before he tried it.” 

Though I wanted to bark at him, I couldn’t disagree. I *should* have looked at deep-fry turkey disaster videos. Might have saved me sitting in an ED on Christmas, pressing my palms into my bandaged face wondering how the hell something could hurt so much.

“Turn that off, Jonah,” Rebecca said, then, to me, “is the pain medicine helping?”

“Yeah,” I lied. My wife, empathetic to a fault, didn’t deal well with sickness or injury. 

By the time the ophthalmologist arrived an hour later, the second dose of Dilaudid had actually kicked in. My eyes and skin still seared from the worst pain of my life, but I didn’t care as much about it. I didn’t care when he sutured my eyelids shut. I didn’t care that Jonah was filming him suture my eyelids shut (“Put that away” Rebecca snapped). I did manage to care that the doctor said I wouldn’t be blind for long and that the sutures and bandages would come off in a week. 

“Just seven days. I’m listening to *War And Peace* in the car. It’s like twenty hours. It’s very good.”

Armed with a prescription for Vicodin, my doctor’s audiobook recommendation, and Rebecca’s notes (she’s an A+ student, a copious note-taker), we left the emergency room.   

“Thank God,” Rebecca said as she reached over me to start the seat warmer and gave me a peck on my lower cheek where the bandages ended. “No permanent damage.”

The way things turned out, permanent damage (eyes ripped from my head, visual cortex removed) would have been nice.  

If there was anything good about my accident, it was the timing. There wasn’t much mortgage brokering being done the week between Christmas and New Year's, so my business wasn’t going to take a noticeable hit. I couldn’t help out around the house (bonus!) which meant Rebecca had a lot to do instead of worrying that the doctor was wrong and I would, in the end, be blind. She set me up on the couch in the living room so I could smell the Christmas tree. She made me lasagna. She didn’t serve any turkey. 

At first, I didn’t think much of what I saw behind my closed lids. Hazy blobs and patterns, dancing patches of light and dark that coalesce into objects and silhouettes, like those after-images you get when you’ve been out in the sunlight and you squeeze your eyes shut. I had those. I chalked it up to the pain meds and—what did the Doc say?—the healing of my eyeballs. It was only a day after the “Bird Bomb” (Jonah’s title for the disaster) so I thought *no big deal*. 

At first.

By the next day, the silhouettes weren’t acting right. They were no longer random shape-shifting blobs. They would track through my visual field, track like they had their own lives. I followed the shape of Rebecca as she walked out the front door to return a Christmas gift. And when Jonah’s heavy footfalls woke me from a nap, I saw his shape traverse the hallway at the top of the stairs. It was as if some signal was getting through my stitched-shut eyelids and inch-thick bandages. But I wasn’t getting any signal from the big window in the living room, no signal from the Christmas lights on the tree. Nothing but those moving forms. 

“Hey Siri, call Jonah.” 

Siri did what she was told. Jonah picked up. “What, dad?”

“I need you to empty my bedpan.” I waited for a chuckle, got none, then plowed on. “Seriously, could you fill up my water bottle?”

“Why didn’t you ask me when I was down there?”

“I still had water when you were down here.”

He *ugh‘ed* but, dutiful son he is, hopped to it. I heard his door open upstairs, heard his feet in the hallway. I drained my giant Stanley tumbler and turned my head to the stairway. There it was: the silhouette gliding downward through space. I couldn’t see the stairs or the string lights on the bannister, just Jonah’s moving form.  

Trying to describe what I saw as he approached me is difficult. He looked like a blown-out black and white video image where the whites are too white and the darks have fuzzy edges bleeding one into the other. Except there was no white. He was more dark on a dark background, moving through space 

“Dad, you’re creeping me out, watching me like that.”

He floated around to the refrigerator, began to fill the cup. Even though my eyes couldn’t technically see, I couldn’t take them off him. 

“I’m not watching you. I can’t see, remember?” I tried to laugh at the incomprehensibility of it: I shouldn’t have been able to see anything, and yet I was.

But what did I know? I was the guy who plopped a half-frozen turkey into boiling oil. I thought about asking Jonah to do a search on ghost images or somesuch but then he’d start to worry I was going nuts and tell his mom, who would really worry I was going nuts. Nobody needed that. 

He approached me and reached out his arm, which looked insectoid and angled in all the wrong places. There was no cup in the hand that I could see but I heard the Stanley clunk on the coffee table. 

“Thanks.”

The insect-arm retracted. The shape stood there, a few feet from me. His head was giant, much larger than Jonah’s actual head, atop a spindly neck. Set in the middle of the dark blob of face, I thought I saw a flash of white. Teeth, they looked like. Pointed teeth. Like fangs. 

Reflexively, I jerked back. My foot kicked the coffee table and the Stanley banged to the ground. “Oh, shoot, I’m sorry,” I blabbered. 

“S’okay. The lid was on.” As he bent down to pick it off the floor I saw what looked like spines coming out of his back, like spikes on the dinosaurs that Jonah used to obsess over. 

I sucked a frightened, kidlike breath.

“You’re freaking me out,” he said. His pointed white teeth—fangs, might as well call them what they were—flashed.

“I’m freaked out because I can’t see my kid,” I tried again to laugh, but the weak sound caught in my throat.

That enormous black blob of a head nodded. As he left, I saw the ends of his hands were talons. 

By the next day, I couldn’t deal with the images any longer. The only time I’d let anyone enter the bedroom was to drop off food and water. Despite my best efforts to act normally, Rebecca was spiraling into her empath hellhole. I kept my back to her when she entered the room with a sandwich, or a plate of cut-up steak, none of which I touched. I didn’t want to eat anything cooked up by the creature that placed the tray on the night stand: a squat, gray, slimy thing with dozens of tooth-filled mouths that covered her head, her chest, her arms. When she spoke, each of the mouths moved. Even her eyes were ringed with teeth. 

“I’m worried you’re not eating,” she said. My eyes were fixed on the far wall; they saw nothing but a black screen. “Ryan, I said I’m worried you’re not—”

“I heard you,” I said. “I’m not eating because the pain meds mean I haven’t taken a dump in three days. And I’m depressed. With all this, I can be depressed, can’t I?”

“Sure,” she said quietly as she closed the door. 

When she settled into bed that evening, I turned my head away from her and into my pillow. Even so, as she leaned over to kiss me, I saw in my peripheral “vision” those mouths puckering and sucking. 

She said,  “I love your sweetmeats.” 

“What?”

“I said I love you, sweetie.”

I got my courage together and risked a glance at her. The mouths leered. They smacked open and closed. I thought I caught a whiff of rotting meat. 

Later, the shape that should have been Jonah sat in a chair across the room from my bed. He’d offered to look up things for me on his laptop. He thought it might help. Like I said, he’s a dutiful son. A good kid. 

Letting him in there, letting him sit that close to me, that was a mistake. 

His fanged mouth seemed to stretch from one bat-ear to the other, the jaw clicked audibly when he talked. His arms were double-jointed. His skin was jet black and covered in oozing boils. He, like his mother, stank. 

“Here’s something,” he said. “Sometimes when you go blind your visual cortex can become excitable and,” he slowed down, “dis-in-hib-it-ed.” My twelve-year-old, I thought, working his lips over an unfamiliar word. Still my twelve-year-old, thank God.

Then Jonah-not-Jonah lifted his oozing, giant head. “But it says you see clear images. I thought you said you’re just seeing shapes.”

“I am,” I lied. “It’s probably some version of the same thing, the whole visual-cortex-excitable thing.’

“And this is cool: it says neighboring neurons from auditory or somato-sensory areas can invade the visual cortex.”

“Yeah, supercool.” Understanding how the visual cortex criss-crossed with the other parts of my brain was above my pay grade. “Anyway, thanks, J. I need to sleep a bit.” *And not see you, not smell you*. “Go play a video game or something.”

“Catcha later.” 

There was something wrong with his voice. A gutteral, metallic undertone.

*I am losing my mind*, I thought. *First the eyes, now the ears.*

“Jonah,” I said. Jonah-not-Jonah stopped at the door. 

“What?” 

Still that same growl. My mouth went dry.

“Remember not to tell your mom I’m seeing shapes, okay? She’s worried enough.”

“I’m not worried, though,” he growled as he walked through the doorway, “because I’m going to rip you apart and feast on your—”

The door closed. My eyes tried to widen but the sutures held tight and sent stabs of pain through my lids. 

A terrifying thought stabbed into my brain: *Not Jonah*. *That thing is not my son.* 

I didn’t let either of them into the bedroom again. The Rebecca *thing* left food and Gatorade outside the door. I listened to its concern:

*This really isn’t normal, Ryan.*

Its worry sounded convincing. But after it finished fussing over me, I could hear its voice, like the sound of grinding gears: *I’m going to gorge on your soft parts. I’m going to slake my thirst with your blood.* 

Yes, I knew I was hallucinating. Both auditory and visual and, when I got close enough to them, olfactory. I got better at using Siri and Chat GPT’s voice function. You learn a lot when you’re alone in your bedroom with nothing but an iPhone. I learned to talk like a doctor (visual, auditory, olfactory). I learned about neuroplasticity. I learned about Charles Bonnet Syndrome. 

This information should have been a comfort to me and it was, to a point. But when Jonah (thing) and Rebecca (thing) scraped along the hallway muttering in their awful voices, I wasn’t so comforted. I was terrified by them and terrified by the conviction that I was going insane. 

But—and this was the most comforting—my insanity wouldn’t last long. One thing my research told me was that, once the sutures were removed, light would hit my retinas, my optic nerves  would fire, and my visual cortex would reset. It would stop getting confused by sounds and smells. It would stop confusing the other parts of my brain. 

December 31st! 

Suture removal! 

The restoration of normalcy! 

I open the bedroom door. In the hallway stand both Rebecca and Jonah (I’d been forcing myself to think of them as Rebecca and Jonah, my wife and kid who were definitely not *things*, not *monsters*). When I see them, though, I gasp and try to cover it with a cough. They (my Jonah, my Rebecca) have grown larger and more grotesque. Jonah stands two feet above me, his multi-jointed arms flicking this way and that. The boils on his midnight-black skin have burst; small white worms wriggle out of the holes and drop like rain onto the ground. Rebecca has ballooned to the width of the hallway itself (impossible). The many mouths over her body are chattering and clacking their teeth. The stench of decay fills my nostrils. 

As much as I try, I can’t think of these things as my family. I can’t close my eyes and not see them. I can’t not *hear* them. Not *smell* them.

Impossibly, the giant creatures are able to fit themselves in the car. The smell makes me gag so I open the window. The Rebecca monster says it’s thirty degrees out and asks whether I feel feverish, but I don’t answer. It takes every effort for me not to fling open the car door and jump from the vehicle. 

We trudge across the clinic’s parking lot, the monsters at my side chattering away and stinking to high heaven. I keep silent. *Thirty more minutes*, I think, *maybe twenty if I’m lucky, maybe ten*. 

I hear other people in the lobby of the building, but don’t see any shapes. I feel relieved. The world outside is normal. It’s only because I’ve been cooped up with my family that I’m seeing them like this.

Other voices chitchat comfortably in the waiting room. I focus on them and not on the grating chatter from the things sitting next to me. 

*Just a few more minutes.* 

The office is efficient and we are taken into an exam room. We sit in silence. I look at my lap, but I can still smell them. 

The door to the exam room opens. 

“How’d it go?” the doctor asks in a clear, human voice. He makes no comment about the monsters in the room, no comment about the smell. 

“Honestly, a bit rougher than I thought it’d be.”

“Pain?”

“More that my mind started playing tricks on me. Sounds a bit crazy probably.”

“Not really,” the doctor says and, again, relief floods me. As he peels off the bandages, he goes on about visual stimuli and cortices, all things I know from my time with Chat GPT. 

For the first time since my accident, I am relaxed and uncoiled. When the bandages come off, I can see light (real light) coming in through my lids. 

“Alicia,” the doctor says to the nurse, “lower the lights please.” From behind my lids, I can see the lights dim. 

“Ready?” the doctor asks, “This can sting a bit.”

I feel a tug on my left lid, hear a snip, then feel a sting. I keep my left eye closed until I feel the same on my right. 

“Okay then, open sesame!” the doctor says. When I don’t open, he leans in close and says, “Ryan, you good? Open your eyes, please.”

I do. The light, even though dim, hurts my eyes. The doctor is close enough to kiss me; his blurry face fills my visual field.

“Blink a few times for me,” the doctor says. 

I follow orders and, after a few blinks, he comes into focus. Normal features. Normal human.

The sigh I give contains more joy than I’ve ever felt before. 

“Looks good,” he says, smiling and straightening his back. “We’ll just need to do a couple of tests to—”

A scream—mine—cuts him off. Behind the doctor, against the wall of the exam room, stands my family. One is eight feet tall with worms crawling out of its skin. The other a stinking blob of flesh, each of its many mouths grinning.",6,1767201489.0,nosleep,0,0.88,False

First off a bit of background. I’ve been roleplaying off and on for over 10 years now. I write exclusively in 3rd person, and I tend to write A LOT haha. I also  can reply several times a week. I also enjoy a decent amount of OOC chat and bonding with my writing partner. That last bit is pretty important to me so please be open to being chatty!

Onto my idea! The other day I was at a 7Brew coffee (one of the drive up coffee places), and they always have a chatty college aged gal there that talks with you for a few minutes as they make your coffee. I’m a sucker for roleplay where strangers fall for each other so I wanted to combine these two ideas. Maybe it just so happens that I come the days that you work and we really start to hit it off. We can throw in days where we don’t match up too (I don’t get coffee or you arnt working). Maybe it progresses to getting your number. I just like the idea that the connection forms over a series of these smaller interactions. Maybe the conversations get more personal despite other coworkers and patrons in their car being around. Maybe there’s drama in one of our lives. There are a lot of ways we could play this out but the main elements are strangers to lovers and also focusing on building that connection in those short bursts rather than hours longs talks or dates.

1q0i4gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MI_transgender_friend/comments/1q0i4gx/final_thoughts_for_the_year/,Final Thoughts For The Year,"There hasn't been a year in recent memory that I am so happy to see go away than 2025.

I cited many of the obvious reasons yesterday. Mostly actions taken against our very existence as transgender people. The breathtaking audacity of this governmental-led societal genocide is terrifying. And the fact that most of the US citizenry just doesn't care about the erasure we are undergoing only adds to the fear.

That's the macro reason why I'm delighted to forget this year. In the micro, it has been a physically bad year for me as well. It began with an emergency appendectomy in January that went sideways and led to complications, and it ends with me suffering the pain of two inoperable herniated discs. Ouch. 

But I approach 2026 with optimism. It's a little forced, I admit, but I refuse to let life's misfortunes keep me down. Sure, I get depressed and sad, but then I get myself together and move on. 

One of the ways I do is by reminding myself that there are a LOT of people in worse situations than me. And some of them are here, in our group and our trans community.

Which is why I'm dedicated to growing our outreach into our community. I would love to see this subreddit, and our sister Discord server, become centers for local trans community involvement.

As 2026 moves on, I hope we can organized community gatherings, be it in parks or even takeovers of public venues such as a coffee shop, restaurant, or bar. Events at which we can be together and meet one another and strengthen our ties.

I would like to foster community involvement in helping community members. Perhaps create a ""bulletin board"" here or on the Discord server, on which someone looking for help, a place to crash, a job, or other aid, can post directly to the community. We should begin acting as a cohesive community, just as other marginalized groups have done in the past. 

Every person has limits to how much community involvement they are willing or able to engage in. But I hope as individuals we can push past those self-imposed impediments in service to the greater good.

If you are celebrating the dawn of the new year tonight, be safe! 

And let's all hope for a happy 2026!

1q0i367,https://www.reddit.com/r/real_anti_racism/comments/1q0i367/scramble_for_africans_1/,Scramble for Africans 1,"This will be the first of four posts summarizing Howard French's book, Born in Blackness, leaving out the moralizing and the personal anecdotes and focusing (hopefully) only on what was or should have been footnoted. Three on footnotes and one on bibliography.

I'll call the Age of Discovery the Scramble for Africans -- really, that should have been his title for the book -- and I'll abbreviate it SfA.

If it's hard to tell, from time to time, how or why the author moved from one point to the next, you all may share in my own bemusement. To me it was often hard to tell what he was after or what his local point was. Say 30% of the time.

Each entry starts with the page number or numbers in French's book on which the information was found. If there is no reference for a claim, I'll put (nr) at the end of it.

First a brief final digression on the book as a whole, then: points he made, and their references.

I asked, in my earlier post on the book, what he wanted us to take from all this. Having finished the book, it seems now that his primary concern was fighting the erasure from history of the enormous and fundamental contributions of black slaves to all that we now think of as modern. As before, I suppose that's a reasonable goal, but I don't see who it really benefits. It's exciting to me, to see the world more truthfully than I did, but no one is going to make more or less money in their lives, or live longer or less long, because they see things the way French does instead of the way they're taught in school now.

I do still have questions. Maybe you all know the answers to some or all of these.

How did he miss the importance of the turbocharged capitalism motive, in investigating the spread of slavery in Africa? My conviction is -- I can't prove it -- that the most remarkable thing about the slave trade, as practiced by these European traders, was the amount of money a slave raider could make, by collecting slaves. This, to me, was the vital element that destroyed two or three continents (Africa and North America; I have no information on how it all played out in South America). And he doesn't seem to have even suspected it. His chosen reasons for the spread of slaving in Africa, on p325, don't mention it at all.

French makes the point clearly, that the islands off the African coast were vital to European operations in Africa, because malaria and yellow fever stalked the continent itself. But why was the African mainland so microbially deadly for Europeans, while it was the Europeans that were microbially deadly, to the American natives? No doubt someone has tried to answer this. Maybe Guns, Germs, and Steel? I should probably take a look at that.

How is it that a few Spanish conquistadores managed to take all of Mexico and Peru, while the entire force that Portugal could muster couldn't conquer Akan, or Kongo? Were the Africans really that much more formidable in battle, than the indigenous Americans? Or is it really all down to the different effects of disease on the different populations?

French makes an important point of the idea that sugar brought coffee, coffee brought coffeehouses, coffeehouses brought newspapers and what we think of as the modern public sphere... which was quickly manipulated by Big Slavery to defend the opening of the royal monopoly on slave trading to the private sphere! In effect, although he doesn't say it outright, he's saying it was slavery that brought us democracy. It seems like an idea that should be investigated carefully. Maybe should even get a book of its own. Or two or three.

I think a more honest account would have followed more closely the historical debate about all this, among historians and economists. He makes it clear he knows there is one, he addresses it directly from time to time, but he ignores so much of it that I cannot imagine that nothing useful has been said, that he ignored. The force of religion in the lives of all involved, just to pick one example, he treats as essentially nugatory. And much of the action on which he reports took place during the Thirty Years' War, which was (at least, without considering his arguments) essentially about nothing else.

Let me expand on that. I don't remember if I've reported on this in this forum, but it's not often recognized that at the time the ship the White Lion was dispatched, to acquire its cargo of Spanish or Portuguese booty, that showed up so famously in Virginia in 1619, Sir Walter Raleigh was in the Tower of London, in peril of his life, for a crime very similar to the one that resulted in the arrival of those Africans. Raleigh was ultimately executed for that crime. This was not a sham prosecution. And yet although the owner of the boat was loyal to the same king, and subject to the same law, he felt he had to do it: certainly for profit, but also because the hated Catholics must, at the peril of his immortal soul, be chastised for their beliefs. Slavery wasn't the only thing that was going on at the time. Religion was happening. Politics were happening. There was a lot going on. And to blame it all on slavery, without paying close attention to the ideas other historians have had about it, is a bit much.

At the very, very, very least: not to have pointed this out at the end of the book, in a place of prominence, as a or one of the final thoughts: laughably unscholarly. This is a book that many people will read and take seriously, as well they should. They cannot defend it properly if they don't know what the author didn't do, and it was his job to point that out to them. So they could then approach the topic in the proper frame of mind, and not get bowled over by people who can see the truth and aren't just being racist, as many will imagine when it comes to the point of dispute. We don't need more divisiveness. We need more clarity.

Finally, at the very end of the book it seemed to become clear that what French really wants us to do with the information is: learn the truth. Stop leaving blacks out of history.

To which I say, well, OK. But is it really the truth you're after? Because I don't think it is. I think you value a specific truth that is subordinate to some other truths that, to me, are more important. Like that if their positions had been reversed, and the Africans had been the masters and the Europeans the slaves, how different do you think the outcome would have been? Would we now be celebrating the rise and glorious tenure of freedom and democracy in Kongo, and deploring the inability of the sadly misdrawn American states to get their act together?

And if that's so, and it seems pretty likely to me, what difference could it really make, who did the oppressing?

I think the lesson we should be teaching our schoolkids is not just that slavery lies at the root of all our success and our progress (I have to say, apart from my caveats above, he makes a pretty good argument for that), but also that the pull of capitalism against morality is one that it is awfully hard to expect the moralizers to win. That the challenge of making that win for morality more likely is the real challenge, for our schoolkids. We have failed, we must say: but this is what must be done. This is what we need.

Points He Made

2 the explorers of the SfA did really usher in a new age (Arana 2019)

4 one of the innovations the SfA ushered in was the so called ""national identity"" (Mamdani 2020)

5 Charles Taylor has postulated two different definitions of modernity, one cultural and one ""acultural,"" and the cultural definition claims that the difference between the Europe of 1415 and the Europe of today is a lot like the difference between medieval Europe and medieval China: they are two different civilizations. The author claims that his book shows this civilizational or cultural modernity is the proper characterization of what the SfA ushered in, with a pretty crisp before and after. (Taylor 1999)

5 well after the beginning of Portugal's spice trade with Asia, a counselor to the crown wrote that he knew of no more valuable income to the crown, than its commerce in Guinea (de Barros 1778) (meaning, the spice trade wasn't all that)

6 Daniel Defoe captured the dependence of current economics on slavery when he wrote: ""No African trade, no negroes; no negroes, no sugars, gingers, indicoes etc; no sugar etc no islands no continent, no continent no trade."" (Earle 1977)

9 in 1808 a typical South Carolina cotton picker delivered 28 lbs/day; by 1846 in Mississippi growers were getting 341 lbs per hand per day (Baptist 2016)

18 Djenné (Mali), early in its life (founded 250 BC), had 15,000 residents, with another 30,000 living nearby (McIntosh & McIntosh, 1981, and Gomez 2018)

19 the concept of ""Black Africa,"" a hypothetical region of perpetually warring tribes without literacy or history, is one the author wishes to confront head on, as well as its seeming implication of a deep racial divide between north African and sub-Saharan peoples (Kane 2016)

20 the introduction of the ""desert-hardy camel"" to the trans-Saharan trade revolutionized transportation in the region ""in the early centuries of the Christian era"" (Garrard 1982)

20 by the 11th century, Ghana's wealth and prestige (from trading gold and salt) allowed it to field ""impressively large"" armies (Falola and Roberts, 2008)

20 ancient Ghana maintained twin capitals, one Muslim and one traditional (Levtzion 1980)

21 in time, Ghana came to produce 2/3 of the gold later found in Eurasia (Levtzion 1980)

22 ancient Mali, like the Europeans, tried to explore the oceans (at least, this was the tale told at Cairo in 1324) (Gomez 2018)

25 Mali of the 13th century AD ""shared key features"" with its predecessor, Ghana: it was an ethnically based polity with castelike divisions, and it maintained separate Muslim and traditional religious practices among the elite (Ware 2014)

25-26 there are a number of references for the political and cultural complexity of 13th-c Mali, in which I had no interest

26 in 1076 the Almoravid Berbers seized control of Awdaghust, a ""critical southern terminus of the trans-Saharan gold trade"" from Ghana, securing Islam's previously vulnerable presence in Europe for another 400 years (Lewis 2008)

28 the population of Mali subjects and vassals when Mansu Musa took control may have been 50 million (Gomez 2018)

29 Mali at the time pursued a thriving trade in both gold and slaves (Cooper 2014)

30 Mansu Musa's 3-month visit to Cairo in 1324 (Gomez 2018)

33 between 1500 and 1800, 3 million slaves were trafficked across the Sahara or via alternate routes to the Indian Ocean and Red Sea areas (Larson 2013)

38 in the 1400s, Zheng He of the Ming dynasty also (in addition to European explorations, that is) led seven maritime expeditions to east Africa and the Red Sea (French 2017)

40 Joâo II of Portugal, the monarch for whom he sailed, seems to have had very little interest in Dias' rounding the Cape (Diffie and Winius 1977)

40 serious works if history written today still pose that accomplishment as a ""Sputnik moment"" (Gordon and Morales, 2017)

41 another common explanation for the SfA has to do with crusading (Seeley 1883)

42 another common explanation has to do with technology (shipbuilding and navigation) (Gomez 2020)

43 by the 1320s historical accounts told of maps in circulation in Europe announcing the presence of a ""gold-rich empire"" called Mali, or ""Melly"" (Fernández-Armesto 1987)

43 14 years after Mansu Musa's expedition, a surviving 1339 map described Africa with some accuracy, including a ""Saracen king"" with an ""extraordinary abundance of gold mines"" (LaGamma 2020)

44 the Catalan Atlas of 1375 describes the coastal locations of Africa in great number and has a ""tremendous amount"" of detail about the interior (Campbell 1981)

45 maps that showed the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa began appearing in the Islamic world in the 10th century (Diffie and Winius 1977)

46 among Europeans, ""India"" meant profoundly different things in different contexts and was ""long used, confusingly, as a toponym for both northeastern Africa and points beyond."" (documented 4 notes down this page)

48-52 here he gives a number of references for the ups and downs of specie shortages in Europe, which he feels is essential to understand the situation

53 the Portuguese captured Ceuta, in one blow both smiting the Islamic power and capturing the north end of the trans-Saharan gold trade -- but the traders just moved that end west to Tangier, and Ceuta did the Portuguese no good (no refs needed, this is all clear in the historical record)

53 the author now switches to the religious motive, saying Henry (The Navigator) wanted to find non-Islamic peoples further south in Africa, who might be good allies against the hard-to-dislodge Muslims. The ""India"" that Henrican documents have in mind is in fact northeast Africa (Russell 2000)

62 Portugal failed to wrest control of the Canary Islands from Castile, and then turned its attention to Madeira and the Azores (nr)

62 on Madeira it became the owner of ""what was probably the first sugar mill of the Atlantic world"" (nr)

62 by the middle of the 1400s Madeira was producing 70 tons of sugar a year, which at the time was thought of as ""an exotic medicinal"" (nr)

63 the plantation production of sugar was ""among the deadliest innovations known to humanity"" (Warren 2016)

63 by 1472 production had risen to 200 tons a year, and approached 800 tons a year by 1500 (nr)

63 starting in 1433 Henry ordered explorations further down the coast of Africa, looking for gold, none of which were successful (nr)

64 these expeditions failed enough to where important men around him spoke scornfully of his interest in Africa (Zurara 1841)

64 and then an attack by Portugal on Tangier, the new northernmost end of the trans-Saharan trade, failed ignominiously in 1437 and, due to the new political climate, forced a slowdown in Henry's navigational efforts (nr)

64 a little earlier (1405-1433), the Chinese had explored the coast of Africa themselves, bringing back giraffes and other ""treasure and exotica"" from the Indian Ocean coast (French 2017)

65 after 1448 the political climate changed again, apparently because it was so easy for the Portuguese to get slaves, and exploration became again the thing in Portugal (Zurara 1841 for the reason)

66 by the 1450s a Portuguese-colonized island off Mauritania was supplying 800-1000 slaves a year to the Portuguese market; this was seen at the time as an enormous bounty, and interest in slave-raiding grew exponentially (nr)

67 the first victim of the Atlantic slave trade was (evidently) taken by a Portuguese raider in 1441; he returned to Portugal with only ten slaves, and for the accomplishment was made governor of the Portuguese town of Tomar and knighted (Bennett 2019)

68 in 1444 a party of six caravels set out in pursuit of slaves; they returned with 235, and this was then the first large-scale successful slave raid of the Atlantic slave trade (Zurara 1841)

71 in 1448 Henry ordered a halt to slave raiding, and in place began conventional diplomacy; ""mutual recognition of sovereignty and the full and complex range of statecraft, would dominate European relations with sub-Saharan Africa well into the seventeenth century"" (Bennett 2019)

71 this was partly because the Portuguese realized that ""an expanding African frontier was the most important overseas maritime theater and potentially biggest ""prize"" for Europe anywhere"" (nr)

71 Africa began to make critical contributions to European wealth and prosperity in the second half of the 15th century, capitalizing Iberian economies and launching a new coin, the *cruzado*, in 1457 (Newitt 2005)

71 West Africa was referred to as ""the New World"" decades before the discovery of the Americas (Russell 2000)

72 another reason Henry changed his approach was, significant numbers of Portuguese were losing their lives in the struggle (nr)

72 another reason was, slaves got harder and harder to come by, and they had to venture further and further away to get them (nr)

72 in one raid in 1445, Africans with poison arrows killed 20 of 22 raiders (Zurara 1841)

73 the Jolof of present day Senegal were the first to ""strike up"" a formal relationship with the Portuguese (nr)

73 in the mid-1400s they had only just freed themselves from vassalage to Mali, and they knew well the ""great empires of the nearby Sudan"" (nr)

73 in 1488 a Jolof prince Bumi Jeléen went to Portugal looking for help in a succession struggle (nr)

74 shortly thereafter, João II dispatched 28 caravels to support the prince's claim to the throne of Jolof; but before they arrived, the captain of the fleet stabbed the prince to death, possibly in fear of a dangerous deployment

74 the Portuguese found many of the kingdoms of Guinea willing to trade for slaves, and this of course was far safer and more effective than rushing ashore waving swords; the Jolof became Portugal's biggest suppliers of slaves (Green 2012)

74 Henry had financed all these expeditions from ""his own funds"" and from funds of the Order of Christ, which he led (nr)

75 Portuguese began selling items of brass to the Africans for slaves: manilhas (thick bracelets), neptunes (tubs and basins), and ingots; and they discovered that the Africans had a very high interest in textiles for trade (which they didn't have so much of) (nr)

75 the West Africans had sophisticated metalworking techniques, as well as the ability to weave fabrics of high quality. What they lacked was ores and (sometimes) the natural plant fibers (nr)

75 17th-c visitors from several European states wrote often about the high quality of African cloth and about their indigo dyeing techniques; some Dutch copied these techniques and sold small quantities into New World markets (nr)

75 In addition to metalwares and textiles for export to Africa, these traders also carried *melegueta* peppers back to northern Europe from Sierra Leone and Liberia; this part of Africa was known as the Pepper Coast (nr)

75 this became the first of the so called ""triangle trades:"" metalwares for slaves, slaves for pepper, pepper for metalwares (nr)

76 a second triangle trade came into existence as soon as the Portuguese ""discovered"" India: Indian textiles were far more advanced than European ones, and Indian cottons in particular (called *chintzes*) were greatly prized in Africa, since they were much lighter and more wearable in African heat than Europe's primary textile produce (wool, hemp) (Parthasarathi 2011)

76 and if the Europeans didn't have Indian cottons to trade, they could hardly get slaves at all (Kriger 2006 and Richardson 1979)

76 in 1469 King Afonso of Portugal leased exploration rights for 5 years for 200,000 *reis* a year, on condition the lessee (Fernão Gomes) extended exploration beyond Sierra Leone 100 leagues per year; this reflects the low value that the Portuguese placed on African exploration at the time, since the total value of the contract was only 0.4% of the crown revenues at the time (Newitt 2005)

77 on the lessee's second voyage, in 1471, he discovered gold, and the location was for a long time known as Elmina, Ghana; this changed everything (nr)

78 the terms of the contract only required Gomes to pay the crown 1/5 of the recovered gold, but this was enough to ""breathe life into Portugal's anemic currency"" (nr)

78 this part of Africa soon came to be known as the Gold Coast; the natives had a ""rich material culture based on intricate and high-quality dyed cloths and finely worked metals"" and only a scarcity of cotton and ores prevented them from making what they wanted (Daaku 1970)

78 The Portuguese began to trade in both cloth and brass basins and ingots, and nothing was new about these items, to the natives, but their quantity (nr)

78 the problem for Portugal was that it couldn't be kept secret, and other European powers soon tried to horn in (nr)

in 1474 Portugal declared it illegal to trade with Mina (Elmina), with death as the penalty; and King Afonso declared the Mina trade would become a royal monopoly at the end of the year (nr)

80 at the end of the year, Henry IV of Castile died, setting up a succession contest in which Afonso of Portugal was arguably a choice; he attempted to impose his will by arms but was repulsed at the Battle of Toro (nr)

80 the worse result for Portugal was, this showed everyone just how much African gold was coming in, or how could they have paid for this army (nr)

81 Isabella and her husband, Ferdinand II of Aragon, suddenly saw the value of raising ""vague but nonetheless decades-old Spanish claims to the region"" (the Gold Coast) but they lacked a navy that could enforce them, and so privateers were hired to predate on Portuguese shipping and to pursue trade with the area (Fernández-Armesto 1975)

81 in 1478 the Portuguese attacked a Castilian convoy on its way back from Elmina, sinking or capturing many of the vessels; the gold that was captured ""is said to have"" been to the value of all the Portuguese costs of the fruitless Battle of Toro. This came to be known as the Battle of Guinea, and was very influential in subsequent peace talks (Blake 1942)

81 those peace talks resulted in the Treaty of Alcáçovas, sanctioned by the Pope and splitting the world up between the Portuguese and the Castilians (Diffie and Winius 1977)

82 by 1489 Portugal was extracting 8000 oz of gold a year; by 1494 it was 24000; and it continued to rise (Wilks Oct. 1982)

82 the effort of Spain, after this, was clearly to keep up: to find gold (there are many references to it in Columbus' journals, and he used the argument to persuade Isabella to support his efforts) (Fernández-Armesto 1987)

82 prior to the discovery of the Americas, West Africa was frequently called the New World (nr, but see Russell 2000)

83 the narrative of the time wasn't a battle over who would find the route to the Indies; it was over who would find gold, and for the time being the Portuguese had won and they had the blessing of the Pope too; and so it is time to ""disremember"" some of the traditional accounting of this era (Lowe 2015)

88 by 1481 trade with Elmina had become so valuable that the Portuguese decided to build a fort there, and in 1482 they did it (nr)

89 Diogo Cão, who ""discovered"" Kongo, a major kingdom far SE of Ghana, was knighted and granted an annuity and a coat of arms; Dias, for rounding the Cape of Good Hope, didn't even get an audience with the king, much less any special honors for the accomplishment (Diffie and Winius 1977)

95 only in the 1640s did the Gold Coast become a major source of slaves, long after Upper Guinea, Kongo, and Luanda (Angola) (nr)

96 once constructed (1482) Lisbon received a caravel shipment of gold once a month from its fort at Elmina, and the volume of gold transformed the life of the nation -between 46 and 57 kg of gold every month (Vogt 1979)

96 trade with Elmina caused royal revenues to double in the last twenty years of the century (ibid)

97 even after Portuguese had made deep inroads into Brazil and Asia, Elmina gold was still valued at a quarter of the royal revenues. At that time the Gold Coast was generating 680 kg of gold a year for Portugal, about 1/10 of the world supply (Daaku 1970)

97 because the Africans scorned most European cloth, the Portuguese began supplying Indian cottons, and even African cloths made in Benin, for sale in Ghana (Vogt 1979)

98 at this time the Portuguese priority was not the route to the Indies, but expanding its gold trade in Africa, identifying other sources besides Ghana (Newitt 2005)

98 a great deal of effort and energy was spent sending another major embassy to Kongo in 1491 (3 years after Dias' glorious achievement) (ibid)

99 but the author does admit that the enormous river of African gold flowing into Portuguese coffers did enable the Portuguese to keep up with the Spanish in their ""headlong course into ocean faring, discover, conquest, crusading, and intercontinental trade"" (nr)

99 Columbus apparently almost accidentally reported his discovery of the Americas to the Portuguese crown before going to Barcelona (which at the time was the temporary seat of the Castilian crown), as Lisbon was a way station on his return journey (Phillips and Phillips 1992)

100 the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas granted Spain all the lands west of a line 370 leagues west of Cape Verde (most of the Americas except Portuguese Brazil, which had not yet been colonized or even discovered); Portugal received Africa and Asia (nr)

100 careful calculations show that Africa generated twice the amount in real returns to Lisbon than the trade in spices and early textiles with the East (Blackburn 1997)

101 Portugal's trade in gold was to be superseded by the trade in slaves, and then by sugar, starting on São Tomé(discovered 1471; colonized 1485), where the sugar plantation became a vastly profitable template for plantation agriculture in Brazil (nr)

101 ""by any reasonable calculation, this would all amount to at least as much of a windfall as Spain received from the Americas"" (nr)

101 but the question here is: how has this story gone so long without being told?

102 white-Arab and white-on-white slavery (mostly involving Slavs) had survived in Italy, in southern France, and in Iberia into the 1500s (nr)

102 by the late 1400 and early 1500s it was in ""sharp decline"" in those areas, but it was ""at least a minor aspect of economic life throughout the Mediterranean world"" until the 1700s (Curtin 1990)

103 for the Akan (who ruled that part of Ghana at the time), slaves were put to work road building, in agriculture, or soldiering, but the emphasis was on assimilating them into society as rapidly as possible. They were married into Akan families, especially females, and integrated in other ways too, often as concubines or domestics, with little stigma attaching (nr)

104 and production of gold was labor intensive, and they had no horses, and needed their men to do work at home, not to be sold elsewhere (nr)

104 about 1480 it was found that the Akan were very interested in buying slaves from elsewhere (nr)

104 there was no notion at the time of being ""African;"" different tribes were different peoples (nr)

I dated some people in these past months nothing serious, and recently met a new guy I known from high school, that I really like, I also started therapy and stopped smoking. This Monday I got a text from my ex saying he hoped I was well, and if I wanted to meet up for a coffee and talk. 5 months ago I would have loved that text, but seeing it now and only feeling disgust towards him made me realise I dont love him like that anymore. I havent responded, and dont intend to do so. Im proud of myself, I never thought I could let him go. Ever.

Most people think persuasion is about being louder, more dominant, or super charismatic. TikTok and IG are full of these “alpha” hacks pushed by loud influencers who’ve never read a research paper in their lives. But the best negotiators? They're not loud. They’re strategic.

This isn’t about manipulation. It’s skill. And the FBI has spent decades turning negotiation into science. This post unpacks those secretsnot from guesswork, but from books like Never Split the Difference by former FBI negotiator Chris Voss, peer-reviewed research, and social psychology classics. Use this not just for boardrooms, but everyday lifeordering coffee, talking to your landlord, or finally getting someone to take you seriously.

Here’s a breakown of what top FBI agents actually do:

\- They never ask “why” questions  

  Asking someone “Why did you do that?” triggers defense mode. Instead, Voss recommends “what” or “how” questions. Like, “How does this benefit you?” That makes people explain their thinking without feeling attacked. A Harvard Law study confirms this: open-ended, non-threatening questions increase cooperation by 34%.

\- They mirror like prosliterally just repeat the last 1-3 words  

  You say, “I’m really frustrated with how meetings are going.” I say, “How meetings are going?” This simple mirroring makes people feel heard and understood. It builds trust fast. Most people don’t even notice you’re doing it. Voss calls it “Jedi mind trick” level, and brain imaging studies back it: mirroring activates the brain’s empathy circuits (UCLA, 2014).

\- They label feelings before logic  

  FBI agents will say, “It seems like you’re under a lot of pressure.” This helps people feel seen. Labeling emotions calms the amygdalathe brain’s emotional alarm systemaccording to research from UCLA psychologist Matthew Lieberman. People become way more rational after being emotionally acknowledged, not before.

\- They make “no” their goalnot “yes”  

  Wild, right? But asking questions that let the other person say “no” makes them feel safe. For example: “Is this a bad idea?” gets more honest feedback than “Do you agree with this?” Voss argues “no” gives people power. And power leads to real conversation.

\- They use “calibrated questions” to shift control without sounding bossy  

  Instead of saying, “Give me a discount,” say, “How am I supposed to pay this when the timeline changed?” This turns your request into a problem they want to solve. A McKinsey report on high-performing sales teams found versioning questions like this increased closings by up to 20%.

\- They always validate, even when rejecting  

  Saying something like, “I understand why you’d feel that way. At the same time…” creates a subtle yes-and dynamic. It’s not agreement, but acknowledgment. This is straight from the FBI training manual on ""tactical empathy."" It works to soothe ego while holding firm.

None of this is about fake flattery or dominance. It’s about controlling tone, asking smarter questions, and making people feel psychologically safeeven in intense situations.

Start practicing these in tiny ways. With customer service. A roommate. Your boss. The results will shock you. Real influence is quiet, calm, and trained. Not loud and viral.",1,1767200911.0,BornWeakBuiltStrong,0,1.0,False

Depois de convencer ele a entrar no mundo de cafés especiais, ele veio aqui e tomou seu primeiro café, foi um Ethiopia lavado, e logo se apaixonou pelo hobby.

Depois de ver horas e mais horas de videos sobre café nos ultimos anos, de ver dezenas de pessoas falando sobre e degustando cafés de fazendas renomadas como a La esmeralda, pepe jijon, geisha village, los nogales e etc. Foi extremamente emocionante me deparar com um cardapio como esse 😍.

Decidir tomar pela primeira vez um geisha panamenho da fazenda lá esmeralda, primeiramente pelo hype em volta da variedade geisha e segundo pelo fato de ser uma fazenda famosíssima. Essa fazenda já produziu cafés de 98 pontos vendidos a mais de 30 mil dólares por kilo.

Minha experiência foi boa, haha. Só isso, boa. O café estava bem saboroso. As notas descritas no cartão eram de pêssego, jasmin e mel.

Quando o café chegou o cheiro me lembrou muito dos café yin e yang da astral. Quando quente, percebi bastante mel e um toque malte. Ao ir esfriando comecei a sentir pequenas explosões de sabores frutados e florais que causavam uma certa pressão em minhas papilas gustativas. Frio, ele mostrou uma acidez bem interessante.

Tentei adivinhar as notas antes de ver as notas descritas no cartão e tinha acertado o mel. Também senti um doce que remete a malte, um certo perfume de flores mas não sabia dizer que era jasmin. Também senti um frutado bem gostoso que, depois de saber, realmente tinha gosto de pêssego.

A última nota sensorial que sentí me fez rir demais. Eu juro que senti algo que me remete a caldo verde com linguiça. Um umami terroso que me faz rir quando encontro em algum café. O unico outro café que eu senti esse mesmo sensorial foram os geishas yin e yang da astral 😅

No final das contas foi uma experiência bem legal. Apesar de ser um café muito bom, estava esperando mais. Ele era complexo e saboroso, mas pelos 15 euros que paguei em 1 xícara, acho que preferia ter comprado um pacote inteiro de algum grão, que não fosse um Geisha. E mesmo se pudesse comprar, por 15 euros, um pacote inteiro desse geisha eu nem sempre o escolheria, mas com certeza compraria-lo de vez em quando.

Then he follows it up with ""or you know, you can sit down and plan out how you want to place to look and then tell me what to do to take care of it"" 

So, work or work. Great. 

He leaves, I get the toddler when she wakes up like 30 seconds later and get her situated with breakfast.

I tidy up the kitchen some and then decide I'm going to try an episode of a.show I've always wanted to watch (Call the Midwife) and I set it up. 

I can't even enjoy it. The entire time I was sitting there trying to watch it, all I can think about is there's chores to be done.

It's literally endless and I can't even enjoy something for a damn hour because I can't stop thinking about the mountain of shit that I'm expected to take care of.

I have to get over it and do it and my life would be so much easier if I'd just get over it and delegate tasks like every other woman.

This is my first contribution to the HA community. This might be only a ""me being dumb"" problem, but I found a lot of forum posts where people complained about getting their G4 doorbell onto HA while I was troubleshooting this. Lots of posts where people said they would integrate into Homekit or Google Home as a bridge but it would always fail when putting the code into HA, or that HA wouldn't recognize the QR codes. Many others said that it worked fine for them, and everything on the internet suggested a major disconnect between the two camps. 

***TLDR: if you just want to see the solution, just go to the bottom and see the code changes. Everything works flawlessly on first attempt with this fix.***

Firstly, my system is entirely homegrown. I use a self-hosted webserver to install a podman containerized home assistant on my KDE Fedora Framework Desktop workstation. Therefore, perhaps my situation is different from those using the nabu casa infrastructure or a windows machine.

This also means that I had to build my own matter server in its own pod.

I have a bajillion devices linked to HA including some of the harder ones (Simplisafe) and medium ones (Nest, Tesla), so while I'm relatively new to the HA community, I have experience making things work. That said, I don't have a background in network engineering (I have some programming skill and can build POSTGRESQL systems in my sleep, but I'm a physicist...this is all self taught). I'm posting on Reddit and not on Github of HA forums because its easier for people to find this, and too many people are very intimidated by Github. HA has quite a high learning curve already!

***The Problem***

After successfully integrating my matter server into HA, I could easily get my doorbell to pair with GHome or Homekit (or Aqara), but under no circumstances could I get it to connect to HA. I tried for like 3-4 hours, giving up in frustration at 1am, another 4-5 hour sleep night (I have a 2 year old lol). The problem is identical to what I described in the first paragraph.

***The Explanation***

This morning with a good shower and about 6 fresh cups of coffee in me, I gave it another shot. This time I grepped logs from my matter server and found some problems, and managed to resolve. I learned a lot in the process and wanted to share it here. I've tried my best to understand this as part of my own learning journey, but if I'm incorrect in any way, please correct me in the comments.

1. My matter server was incorrectly set up as a bridge network, not a host network. This means that containers get isolated IPs and cannot communicate with other containers on the same bridge. Therefore, my matter container was unable to see my wifi network. My container only saw eth0 (the bridge interface). It could not see wlp192s0 (primary/host interface). It was trying to interface with a container that couldn't see its own host! **Think of this as a musician walking into a recording studio trying to find the rest of her band but the receptionist has no idea what band they're taking about and no idea where they might be, and could only see the schedule of her studio and not of all the other studios belonging to the same company.**

2. I learned that matter uses what's called mDNS/Bonjour (UDP port 5353) for discovery. *mDNS/Bonjour is basically a protocol language that allows devices to tell the world what they are* **(hey! my name is Doorbell! I would like to connect with like minded devices so we can do cool things together!)**. Other devices on the same protocol can understand this language and respond back. mDNS means that the G4 communicates that its a doorball on a special IP address, and other devices that sit on that same IP address and reply if they are a like minded device that would like to mingle. The problem is that the devices that wanted to mingle all sat on a different network and couldn't hear the doorbell. **Think of this as our hapless musician getting directions to ACME Recording Studio in Omaha Nebraska, but the ACME recording studio with the rest of her band is actually in Chicago Illinois.** The musician walks into the Omaha studio, announces who she is, and gets blank stares.

***The Solution:***

**Step 1:** I changed the network mode from [<domain>-network] to [host] in /container-matter-server.service

    **before**: 
    network <host>-network \     #<host> is the name of my webserver, which i am not disclosing
    **after**: 
    network hos     #hos is host mode

**Step 2:** I changed the primary interface  from eth0 to wlp192s0 in /container-matter-server.service

    **before** 
    --primary-interface eth0     #eth0 is the bridge interface
    **after** 
    --primary-interface wlp192s0     #wlp192s0 is the wifi interface where devices are

**Step 3:** I added new network capabilities, adding operational capabilities for network administration and for raw socket access for mDNS to /container-matter-server.service. This was missing before, meaning that the matter server did not have permission to perform network operations critical for matter support outside of its specific container.
 
    **before**: nothing
    **after**: 
    --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \     #network admin ops
    --cap-add=NET_RAW \    #raw socket access for mDNS

**Step 4:** I changed the connection URL from ""ws://matter-server:5580/ws"" to ""ws://192.168.68.78:5580/ws"" in the Home Assistant Matter Integration settings. This means I deleted the old matter server from my HA and re-added it with a different ws:// url. The difference is that the old url was the container name, which only works on the same bridge network. the new one uses the host IP, since the matter server is on host network. *Ironically, I tried this in the past and failed, and my roundabout solution was to connect via container name, and that's probably where I fucked it up. I still fucked up enough of the rest of it for it to still be a problem...probably why this address failed in the first place*

I then restarted the matter server, re-did the matter plug-in integration in HA, and connected using Aqara bridge (I was lazy and didn't want to reset everything again, plus I'm curious about the Aqara features). It worked flawlessly on first attempt. I was even able to pick up the QR code iwthout issue from the receiver box. Everything worked like clockwork, just like with Homekit or Google bridges. I also want to give a big shoutout to Cursor.AI's excellent debugging agent, which was invaluable in teaching me what was going on, what it meant, and how to fix it.",2,1767199954.0,homeassistant,1,1.0,False

However, with changing times, there has been a rising shift in the counter movement, aka the rise of maximalism.

Replacing the muted and pale colours are bold colours, rich textures and a form of personal expression. Be it in the homes or workspaces, maximalism is redefining how people are designing their interiors and their personal spaces.

If you are curious to transform your space with a vibrant, energetic and unique approach, maximalism is the way to go. This [Artifex Interio](https://artifexinterio.com/) guide will highlight all the details.

# What Elements Constitute a Maximalist Interiors?

At its core, maximalism champions individuality. It truly rejects the notion of the universally “perfect” aesthetic. There are numerous individual elements that shape up the concept of maximalist interiors.

Following are a few worth highlighting:

# 1. Bold Colours and Contrasting Tones

One of the biggest elements of maximalism in terms of interior design is the fearless use of colour. From bright deep jewel tones to vibrant primary colours, a maximalist interior is all about unexpected combinations of pink and mustard or navy and emerald green. Be it on walls, furniture or even in decorative accents, they do create a visually rich environment.

# 2. Layered Patterns and Textures

Beyond bright and bold colours, another important element of maximalism is mixing patterns. Components like floral wallpapers, geometric rugs, animal prints or baroque upholstery, maximalism is all about embracing the beauty of diverse patterns – all in one space.

# 3. Statement Furniture and Décor

Another important aspect of maximalism interior is the inclusion of statement furniture and décor. There are numerous factors like an oversized plush sofa or a unique vintage bar cart that adds an element of surprise to the space you are living in. The key is to find unique pieces that seem cohesive but also unique at the same time.

# 4. Gallery Walls and Art Collection

Maximalism interior is truly incomplete without a striking gallery wall, which truly make up for the interior ideas for living room. Showcasing and displaying your personal moments on the wall is truly a reflection of your favourite moments in life. Beyond gallery walls, maximalism is also all about adding multiple artworks in various sizes and styles.

# 5. Bookshelves with Personality

If there’s one thing that will truly transform your space, it is the inclusion of bookshelves. More than a storage, bookshelves stand out as a “showcase” for all your collections, adding to the maximalist nature of the interior décor. To make things look cohesive in the shelves, consider arranging the books based on size, colour or even stack the coffee table books with interesting cover art.

# How to Incorporate Maximalism Without Overwhelm?

At [Artifex Interio](https://artifexinterio.com/blog/the-rise-of-maximalism-bold-and-personalized-interiors-in-your-home-and-workspace), our designers work with numerous different clients whose decorating ideas for living room, bedroom and the entire space is subjective. Maximalism, being in trend, is also an aspect that many of our clients show their interest in.

If you are in a similar boat but cautious about diving head first into maximalism, following are a few tips that our designers suggest to prevent you and your space from feeling overwhelmed:

# 1. How Much is Too Much?

When you are working through the master bedroom decorating ideas and maximalism is something you are interested in, the key is to start small. You don’t have to go all out and put everything into one space in one go.

Instead, start with a single area like an accent wall with shelves or a reading nook in your bedroom with shelves to store all your books. Once you get used to seeing the design and feel good about it, consider expanding the maximalist design ideas to other parts in the home.

# 2. What Colour Palette Should You Choose?

Maximalism, unlike minimalism, focuses on bright and vibrant colours to truly add definition to the space. If you don’t want to regret embracing a shift in your design approach, consider starting with a cohesive colour palette.

Let your living room showcase a bright red accent wall but ensure that the colours aren’t clashing too much and becoming an eyesore. The key is to choose a dominant colour and then introduce complementary hues.

# 3. What about Negative Spaces?

A common misconception that people have about maximalism design is thinking that every inch of the space has to be filled. Allowing some negative space around key pieces ensures the design doesn’t feel chaotic.

# 4. How to Blend New and Old?

A maximalist space benefits from a blend of modern and vintage elements. Pairing a sleek contemporary sofa with a vintage rug and an ornate chandelier can create a striking contrast. Sometimes, shifting things around in your space doesn’t always mean you have to forego furniture pieces that have been with you for decades.

My likes: fruit, citrus, fresh, green, aquatics, soft/etherial, tea and coffee 

Dislikes: cinnamon and clove, lipstick, soapy/laundry, smoke, incense

Here we go! No ratings, these are all 10/10 for me. Please share yours! 

Top 10 Perfumes of 2025:

1. Astrid **The Audacity** *Black currant absolute, green cognac, bergamot, cashmere musk, spun sugar, and orchid* 

I got this as a sample with my first order and immediately upsized. I recently got a back up bottle too. This scent just hits everything for me, it’s juicy and fruity but not too sweet, the green cognac note is so interesting and the orchid is just floral enough to give it that summery flowy feeling. I am never not in a mood for it. 

2. Briix **Dance of the Forest Nymph** - *Fresh Raspberries, sweet Raspberry Puree, boozy Amaretto wine, Magic Sugar Crystals, Fresh Air Breeze, Vanilla, Treemoss, Amber Resin, and Woodland Forest* 

I got this as part of a sample pack back in the summer when I was still very much into Niche and ordering samples/decants of Nishane, Dyptique, PDM, and many (many) others while I was looking for what I want for my bday full bottle purchase. This one won out all completion! It’s like eating raspberries from a crystal plate out in the meadow in the mountains. Absolutely adore it. 

3. Arcana Wildcraft **Unicorn Horn** - *French vanilla, Bourbon vanilla, golden iris, powdery orris, creamy musk, and sheer silk* 

Powdery and sophisticated “grown up” vanilla. To my nose this is the same profile as Celine Black Tie, which is hot and sold out currently. I like Unicorn Horn more! I feel like a million bucks when I wear it. Stunning. 

4. Sorce **String of Lights In the Forest** - *Vetiver, lavender, beeswax absolute, golden orbs of amber, vanilla milkshake, Ambroxan*  

My #1 scent from this brand and I have tried many! Soft and fluffy lavender milkshake with a beeswax note that is so incredibly comforting. When I first wore this I kept thinking “omg, I smell incredible”. This will always be in my collection as long as it’s available. 

5. Cirrus **The Idea of You** - *hinoki, cannabis terpenes, ocean mist, aldehydes, mimosa blossom, tonka bean, deer musk accord(vegan)* 

Green, fresh, and a little “something” extra from the cannabis note makes this for a beautiful perfume to wear when I’m tired of fruit and vanilla. I wore this to a cabin trip in PNW and it was perfection. Such a talented perfumer, cannot wait to see what she does next year. 

6. Firebird **Saltwater** - *ocean water, salt air, driftwood* 

My favorite aquatic so far, easy breezy and refreshing. Like all Firebird I’ve tried, it’s simple but well executed. Aquatics have a tendency to turn into aftershave on my skin, but this doesn’t. Can’t wait for warmer weather so I can wear it more. 

7. Cardinal Scents **Girl Crush** - *hazelnut cappuccino, raspberry body spray, pear shampoo, warm skin musk* 

New addition and a successful blind buy, this is very soft coffee with a touch of hazelnut and raspberry. It wears light but I find it so delicious I don’t mind respraying. 

8. Nui Cobalt **Cicada’s Last Song** - *Crisp leaves, dry blonde hay, old flannel, black soil, and raw maple sap.* 

My top favorite fall atmospheric so far, interesting but super wearable. For some reason I get apples in this, and I don’t mind. I already have scent memories attached to this scent of taking my kids to the plant nursery and making a new flower bed. 

9. Alkemia **Ghost Fire** - *A luminous attraction of ethereal white ambers. Hauntingly beautiful.* 

I got a freebie sample of this in a swap and at first wasn’t sure about it, it seemed like a very light vanilla or something. Turns out that’s white amber. On skin it’s really magical, etherial aura swirls of silver and white. If a ghost wore a white sleek business suit. I have a full bottle of this in a non alcohol spray format and need to wear it more. This would be a great scent for the office. 

10. Deconstructed Eden **Persephone Smiles in the Dark** - *Black cherries, crushed black pomegranate arils, Turkish delight, dried hay, pink pepper, narcissus, and ambergris.* 

Juicy dark fruit, very well blended. A little bite from the pink pepper. It’s been hard to find a good cherry without leather, and this is it for me. An intoxicating and sexy scent. On me projection and longevity of this is insane, which makes it an excellent scent to wear on special occasions and/or outside. This was a limited edition and I hope they bring it back! 🤞🏼 I think I’ll wear it for NYE 🎆",26,1767199900.0,Indiemakeupandmore,2,0.97,False

Yea I know in the crazy world of Reddit everyone wants it rough and to be degraded.  *Daddy hurt me* type of stuff.

Sorry but that is just not me,  I am not a sadist, not even a little bit.  I am a caregiver, a mentor, a protector.  

I am not looking to play games or an online only situation.
 
I like to travel, long road trips, exploring the local car show, visiting the flea market or going to the mall and seeing how many people we can shock.
I am open to see what kind of relationship this could be - anything from a FWB to a move in long term relationship. 

I do not want a relationship that is founded on anything except an ability to connect and have that chemistry - be it over coffee in bed on a Sunday morning or possibly packing our bags heading to some yet decided destination, or taking a road trip just to chat the day away about all the music you choose.

I do have a kinky side, commonly looked at as a Soft Dom / Daddy / Caregiver. However the rest can wait and be discussed if there is ever a need.

What I seek in a partner, well someone younger (I have knack for stating the obvious) but there is no specific age range.

* Lets watch movies cuddled on the couch or taking a long road trip.
* Let me make you breakfast in bed, or give you a hot bath before brushing out your hair.
* Let me tie you to the bed and edge you for hours on end, or cover you in wax.
* Let me take you to the mall for a new outfit before dinner at your favorite restaurant.
* Let me own you and you be my free - use partner.
* Let me hold your hand as we walk through the local museum or on the beach in Hawaii.
* Someone that can laugh at themselves, but can also dish it out.
* Someone that knows how to have fun, but when to be serious.
* Someone that has passion for life.
* Someone that can understand there is more to life than ""things"".
* Someone that gets just as excited about a trip to the beach as to the local flea market.
* Someone that can enjoy the classic B movies as well as modern films. And yes Godzilla truly is the King of Monsters.

I have likely left way too much off of this, but don't want to bore everybody at the same time, so if I have raised your curiosity at all, send me a message and lets see if we can get that cup of coffee one day soon.",1,1767199848.0,AgeGapSocial,0,1.0,False

1q0hj7x,https://i.redd.it/awdph996kkag1.jpeg,Happy New Year.,"So...I don't know how to start this off, given that I was a newer arrival to Tracen. I haven't really built much of anything since my arrival here. Still, I have to give out my commendations to certain people and factions that I have affiliated with over the time I've been here since then.

To the Rider Association, especially Kitaoka: I thank you kindly for taking me in, despite the risks that involved holding Kurayami and hence, my burden as Calibur. I understand that I have already carried enough, given my the reemergence of the dark blood of the fell dragon that I was born with exacerbating the effects, but I still fought with the determination, grit, and the sorrowful anger that is essential for any Rider to maintain. And while frankly, Kitaoka has played the only sane person to my antics, he has contributed more to how I approach any trouble, be it big and small. May I continue to be worthy of this legacy...and if the discussion between CB and him, Black Sun could still be on the table.

To Nolan, and by extension, Mark: I may have not talked much, due to my wish to not overextend to a figure of authority and all, but despite that, you have still believed the best in me, even if I falter at the worst of times. And furthermore, I still maintain to repay that atonement in some way, given I entrusted to you a hopeful future, only for it to be snatched away by sheer cruelty. I hope you continue to maintain your trust in me, as an ally, and a newly minted Trainer.

To the crew of the Mons: I understand that with regards to the ship, we may need to do a bit more work than we could chew, and as quartermaster, it is to be my duty to account checks and balances when it comes to inventory. And so far, we're burning through the midnight oil, both in rescue and in combat. But rest assured, eventually, our fleet will rise up, and we will be the stable haven and bulwark against the evil Tracen needs. Also, to the boys in R&D: I see you guys doing some crazy ideas to Project M.E.G.A.S down there. You guys were trying to replace the FUBAR'd head with a blue Countach! I don't even have a driver's license! I can't have a car for a head! Stop doing that, and if you really have to, just pick the one that's somewhat easy to control! Naga's sake...

Dino, we may have started out honestly as fledgling trainers, but I will be honest with you, you are, at least in part, the heart of Team Stardust. Your way around inspiring the trainees reminds me of a brother I once had back in the day, the one who truly cared for both his subjects, and his peers. I will do my best, as your shadow, to account for any missteps, and lead our trainees to victory, no matter the odds!

And finally, to...well, the 3 most important people to me, right now...

Monika...it's kinda funny, it started off as a mission to save you, you know? With Eclipse? As I learned more and more of your character the way you inspire others and how you take charge of any situation you believe you can take on over, I grew...closer, to you in a way. And when you asked me out of the blue, I simply accepted, because I think my heart and yours can relate to some aspects...we both had a darker side to ourselves, so, I think it surmises to say, we know how to pull ourselves out of that darker self. I...want to know more about you. Entirely. Because I think just as I once saved you...you'd save me, too.

And speaking of, Eclipse. Friend in arms. Fellow Rider. A fellow soldier and mysterious pub owner. My Captain...you are...someone I'm also curious about. That eternal mystery allure that you give, it behooves me as an explorer to want to discover it and understand you. Although upon that fateful snowy day, I understand in part: that we are equally broken by revelations and events that haunt us, maybe to this day. But you are the one that kept me going. To use that brokenness as a way to protect. A way to save when the chips are down. And...in a way, you fixed me when I feel like I'm about to crack. And I hoped to do the same too. Not just as a comrade that fought once or twice alongside. But as your Shepherd. And your equal piece.

And finally, my Northstar, my impossible Dreamer, Don Quixote. It was frankly quick on how equally we bonded and shared feelings for each other on that little coffee date. And on that night...I knew then and there: I didn't care how quick it was...because somehow, it was inevitable. You are my light, my guide to the fields of the west wind. How could I not love you? And with that...even with this accursed strength of mine. This dragon will continue to protect its most treasured knight. Forever and always.

...and to those I haven't mentioned, thank you, thank you truly. From the normal men to the outstanding forces....you truly contribute to my worth as both a friend and someone to rely on in times of trouble, and I hope to continue that always.

...haaah, that's...lightening my chest a bit. Now, to get to that festival...

1q0hiwl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0hiwl,"2025, year in review.","This year turned into a coffee year. Not on purpose. It just happened.

I didn’t set out to do a tour. I travel for work, family, and life. Somewhere early in the year, coffee became the constant. If I landed somewhere new, I looked up shops. If I had a free morning, I went hunting. Some trips were planned around coffee. Others became coffee trips after the fact. A lot of those decisions came from reading and asking questions here.

By the end of the year, my kitchen looked like this. Empty bags everywhere. Cards stacked. Notes scribbled. Some hits. Some misses. A few cups that still live in my head.

Cities, I hit that stood out and left a solid memory - many more along the way that didn’t make the cut.

Los Angeles

The volume here is overwhelming, but a couple places stood out. The Boy and the Bear delivered consistently solid cups, and Dayglow was exactly what you expect if you follow coffee online. High quality, curated, and well executed. My 17 year old son still talks about the drink he got at Dayglow as he says it’s the best thing he’s ever drank anywhere - if I remember correctly, it was called a Warhol. I bet I’ve tried 30 shops in LA, these two were the standouts though.

San Diego

Bird Rock was super solid. It’s a staple for me when I’m in San Diego now. Zumbar was another standout. 

Boise, Idaho

One of the bigger surprises of the year. Multiple solid shops (Slow by Slow and Neckar stood way out to me), no attitude, and genuinely thoughtful coffee. Hit multiple others, but these two are in a league of their own.

Salt Lake City

Idle Hands was the standout roaster, Culture and Loki were the standout shops. This was early in the year and helped set the tone. Nothing flashy, just well executed coffee that made me want to keep exploring. 

Denver, Colorado

Sweet Bloom and Corvus anchored this stop. Both delivered exactly what you want from Denver. Technically strong, well sourced, consistent. Not a lot of chaos, but very dependable.

Minneapolis, Minnesota

Dogwood was the standout. Quietly excellent. Less hype, more substance. This was one of the cities where a few cups made me stop mid sip and recalibrate what I thought I was chasing.

Chicago, Illinois

Metric was my favorite, but I’m sure there are a ton of places there that I didn’t have enough time to hit. I’d certainly like to go back and try some more. 

Rapid City, South Dakota

Harriet and Oak was solid, but Speedgoat surprised me. The best espresso I think I have ever had. Balanced, expressive, and perfectly dialed. Completely unexpected and easily one of the highlights of the year.

Sioux Falls, South Dakota

Coffea became my default stop. Their Flagship blend ended up being my favorite all around espresso bean of the year. Balanced, forgiving, consistent. No gimmicks. Just something you can drink every day and be happy. It’s a staple in my house now.

Bella Vista, Arkansas

Helped my buddy move his mom across the country ending in Bella Vista Arkansas. Only after arriving did I realize it was the home of Onyx! This was a killer surprise to a spot I suspected the coffee scene to not exist - sheer luck!

Barcelona, Spain

Nomad lived up to its reputation. Excellent coffee in a city that doesn’t revolve around it. But the real surprise was a tiny shop in Castelldefels called The Palms. The owner roasts small batches daily. His espresso was top notch. One of those places you stumble into and immediately remember.

Maui, Hawaii

O’o Farm stood out above everything else I tried in Hawaii. Small farm, thoughtful processing, and genuinely great coffee. Easily the best coffee I had on the islands.

Then there was Tijuana.

My favorite coffee experience of the entire year was in Tijuana, Mexico.

My wife and I crossed the border early in the morning, grabbed an Uber, and rode about forty five minutes deep into the city to find a hole in the wall shop we had read about on Reddit. No signs catering to tourists. No English menu. No sense that Americans were the target audience.

The barista spoke just enough English to get us through ordering. The rest was hand gestures and trust.

The coffee was phenomenal. A peach co ferment that was loud, expressive, and still clean. The kind of cup that makes you stop talking. That coffee reset my expectations in a way no hyped release did all year.

Later that day, we stood in the sun for two hours waiting to walk back across the border. Hot, tired, dehydrated. Still worth it. No question.

Between trips, I ordered a lot online.

Major standouts.

Black and White. Love their lineups and I seem to always find something funky and/or wild here.

S and W. Precise, repeatable, thoughtful, and affordable. I ordered more early in the year and have noticed their popularity shifting upward later in the year making it harder to purchase. Still a favorite though.

September. Best decaf I had all year - maybe ever. Rainbow Decaf was absurdly good.

A jar of Colombia Pitalito from Glitch that my sister brought back. Absolutely fantastic. Glitch is firmly on my 2026 list.

A few things this year taught me.

Great coffee exists almost everywhere if you look.

Hype and quality overlap less than the internet suggests.

Some of the best cups happen when you stop trying to optimize and just drink.

A lot of these stops came directly from advice here. Some were home runs. Some were learning experiences. All of them made the year more interesting.

If you have cities I missed, shops I should prioritize, or roasters I need to order from next year, I’m listening.

Now these are going into the trash bin so I can start over tomorrow…. 

TLDR: Spent the year chasing coffee while traveling for work and life. Found great coffee almost everywhere if I looked hard enough. Standout shops included Idle Hands in Salt Lake, Dayglow and The Boy and the Bear in LA, Bird Rock in San Diego, Sweet Bloom and Corvus in Denver, Dogwood in Minneapolis, Coffea in Sioux Falls, Speedgoat in Rapid City, Nomad and The Palms in Spain, and O’o Farm in Maui. Best coffee experience was a hole in the wall shop in Tijuana after a long border crossing. Best decaf was September’s Rainbow Decaf. Favorite all around espresso was Coffea Flagship.

The plane slammed onto the tarmac. I gripped the armrest so hard my knuckles turned white, my stomach lurching into my throat. I ripped off my headset, gasping for air.





The pilot was already stalking around the side of the plane.





His shoulders were locked tight. His face was stone cold. He was definitely the type that would make girls back home lose their minds.





But me? Zero interest.





Actually, I kind of wanted to punch him.





When I boarded, I'd been polite. I said hello. And him? He looked right through me like I was a smudge on his pristine window, then turned away.





Three hours in the air. The guy was a statue with a pulse. Aside from a cold ""Buckle up"" at takeoff, he hadn't said a word. When I finally asked how much longer, he shot me a look like I was speaking Alien.





Now, he hoisted my heavy suitcase Like it was an empty cardboard box.





I opened my mouth to say thanks, but he'd already grabbed my backpack with his other hand. He didn't even look at me. Just marched toward the metal shed.





I ran after him. ""Hey, you don't have to - ""





""Get the door.""





Wow. Charming.





Heat flared in my chest.





I wasn't helpless. I didn't need him showing off. His ""help"" felt more like an insult. Who cares if he was hot? His personality was absolute trash.





But I bit my tongue and picked up the pace to kick the door open.





I was here for a fresh start. No point letting some frostbitten jerk ruin it.





Not worth it.





Inside, the heat hit me. A woman in a thick down jacket hurried over. Evelyn Vale, the principal.





""You're finally here!"" She beamed, grabbing my hand. ""I hope Declan didn't talk your ear off.""





She winked at the ice block standing behind me.





Declan didn't even look up. He dropped my luggage at my feet with a heavy thud.





""No, he was - ""





Before I could finish, the door banged open. Cold wind swirled in, and just like that, he vanished into the snow.





Like a phantom.





...a rude, mute phantom.





""He's a good pilot,"" I lied.





Evelyn sighed. ""He's the best. Just colder than the permafrost. Anyway, welcome to Spruce Town, Tessa.""





""Thank you.""





""Let's get you to the hotel. You look like you're about to pass out.""





She wasn't wrong. Lately, life felt like sleepwalking. My brain was foggy, and my feet felt heavy, like I was walking on cotton.





Evelyn's beat-up SUV bumped along the snowy road.





At an intersection, she pointed to a small building across the street. ""There's your new battlefield - Tikkonnit Valley Middle School. One hundred and eighty-three people, total. Scared yet?""





She shot me a teasing look.





I couldn't help but laugh. ""Evelyn, back in Chicago, I handled three thousand kids. This? This is a vacation.""





""Alright, city girl."" She turned the wheel. ""Let's get you settled. Here we are.""





The car stopped.





While Evelyn unloaded the bags, I stared at the ground. Suddenly, I froze.





There were boot prints in the snow.





But right next to them... massive paw prints.





They were huge.Nightmares with fur.Definitely not a dog, and way bigger than any wolf I'd seen in a zoo. The claws had punched deep into the packed ice. It looked dangerous.





That thing could rip a head off with one swipe.





I gulped and pointed. ""Evelyn... do you get a lot of wild animals out here?""





Her hand paused on the door handle.





""It's winter. Bears, moose... sure."" Her eyes flickered with something I couldn't place. ""Oh, and wolves. They come around. Just don't mess with them, and they won't mess with you.""





She pulled the door open with a comforting smile.





Duh.





Who's dumb enough to go poking a wolf, anyway?





Chapter 2





It was dinnertime. The restaurant was a zoo.





Evelyn was in full ""Show Pony"" mode. She paraded me around like a prize-winning poodle, introducing me to the postmaster, the hotel owner, and a dozen faceless locals whose names evaporated from my brain the second they hit the air.





I wore my bulletproof fake smile. Shake hand. Nod. ""Lovely to meet you."" Repeat.





Exhausted.





I was more exhausted than I'd been after the ten-hour flight.





I might have high-functioning depression, but that didn't stop me from winning the Oscar for Best Fake Normal Person. I knew how to make people feel like I was a breath of fresh air, even if my brain was just static snow.





The second I got my room key, I fled .





I locked the door.The world finally shut up.





I pulled out my phone and texted my parents: Made it to Graytooth safe.





Five minutes later, Mom [replied.One](http://replied.One) word: Received.





I stared at that cold period until the screen went black.





Right. Expected.





A familiar chill rolled up from my stomach.Doctors called it a physical symptom. I called it what it was - emptiness.





I stripped down to my lace underwear. The numbness inside was settling in, heavy and cold. I needed something sharp to cut through it. To confirm I was still here.





I shoved the window open.





Pitch black. No moon.The wind howled in, slashing my face like a razor.





Good.





Suddenly, a wolf howled in the distance - wild, mournful - and the sound echoed through the mountains.





Possessed, I stepped barefoot onto the balcony.





Forty below zero.The air froze my skin instantly, stinging like a thousand needles. The rush was immediate. Brutal.





Then - a sound from below.





Crunch.





Boots crushing ice.





I froze. Looked down.





Directly below, standing on the street, was the damn mute pilot. Declan.





He was looking up. His eyes, usually hidden under his hood, were locked dead on me.





It was still that same look, like I was trash, but now there was a flicker of shock. His gaze felt like it had hooks, scraping over my nearly naked body.





His eyes asked a silent question: Is she high?





The wind hit me again, and reality crashed in - I was wearing two scraps of lace.





Shame erupted like lava, rushing straight to my face. I felt like I was burning up.





Damn it, damn it, damn it!





I scrambled back inside, slammed the window, and yanked the curtains shut.





The room felt like a sauna now. I rushed to the bathroom, scrubbing my arms and face with a cold towel, trying to scrub the memory out of my brain.





""Idiot,"" I hissed at the mirror.





Not just depressed. Now I'm an exhibitionist, too. In his eyes, I was probably officially crazy.





I checked the locks, killed the lights, and buried myself under the covers, playing dead.





Minutes later, heavy footsteps echoed in the hall.





Thud. Thud.





Rhythmic. Heavy. Like they were stomping on my heart.





The footsteps stopped. Right next door.





The scrape of a key in a lock. The click of the tumblers turning. Loud in the silence.





I stared at the ceiling in the dark, a dry laugh stuck in my throat.





Are you playing with me, God?





That stone-faced bastard is my neighbor?!





Chapter 3





I didn't care about much these days - except teaching. Because that was about the future of a few dozen kids at Tikkonnit Valley High. I had to have some professional standards.





First day. The bell rang. A few stragglers dragged themselves in and slumped into their seats like they were serving prison time.





""Morning."" I cleared my throat. No small talk. ""I'm Ms. Romano. Taking over for Mr. Hendricks.""





""You read Dickens last semester, right?""





A few slow, dull nods.





""Did you like it?""





Dead silence.





I laughed.





""Okay."" I tossed the textbook onto the desk. Thud.





""I hate them too. Boring as hell.""





Suddenly, the dead eyes in the room snapped open.





""I have a lit degree, but I'm basic. I like sci-fi. Fantasy. Explosions. New rule: No dusty antiques. We're reading Howl's Moving Castle. Your assignment? Find a book you don't want to burn.""





My old colleagues called it rebellious. I called it ""resurrecting the dead.""





I handed out the books, and the room finally had a pulse.





Win.





...





Time flew. I figured out the town's survival guide pretty fast.





Two camps: The Welcome Wagon, and The Haters.





Hank, the outdoor shop owner? Team Hater.





One morning, he sneered between bites of bacon, ""Bet it's colder and darker here than you expected, huh?""





I took a sip of coffee, not even looking up. ""Nope. Same as the Midwest.""





He frowned, doubling down. ""Chicago doesn't have grizzlies.""





""No,"" I said flatly. ""But I haven't seen any here either.""





Behind me, Owen chuckled. ""She got you, Hank.""





Owen was a local giant who rarely spoke. I liked him. Quiet meant I didn't have to perform.





Claire, on the other hand, was the opposite.





Her daily mission seemed to be auctioning me off to the local bachelors, like I was fresh meat for the gene pool. She'd shoo away tourists and force me into a circle of local men. It was subtle as a brick to the face.





I couldn't tell her I had zero interest in men. Six months of therapy and antidepressants only taught me one thing: how to play the role of a functional human being.





Meds plus caffeine. That was the only fuel keeping the machine running.





Monday morning. I walked into the diner.





""Tessa!"" Claire's voice boomed. She waved excitedly at an empty bar stool.





It was flanked by two local guys, sitting there like brick walls waiting for me. Another ambush setup.





I sighed. Fine. Commit to the bit.





I hung up my coat and resigned myself to the seat.





I turned my head - and nearly jumped out of my skin.





That damn bush pilot - Declan - was sitting right across from me.





The last time we met, I was the crazy exhibitionist shivering in my underwear on a balcony in forty-below weather.





Our eyes locked.





His relaxed face instantly froze. He looked away like he'd been tazed, acting like staring at me might actually blind him.





Ants. That's what it felt like. Embarrassment crawling all over my skin.





Oblivious to the weird vibe, Claire poured my coffee with a bright smile. ""Tessa, have you two been properly introduced? This is Declan Kovak.""





I forced a stiff smile.





Introduced?





Ha.





We were way past a simple ""met.""

1q0hgsq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0hgsq,Here are my completions this year,"Ended up getting '41' completions - I play a lot of games for content and want to spend more time working through my back catalogue, so my 2026 bingo card (as the last image) is my plans for a few more chunky ones to work on for next year.

  
I technically have 104 completions on Steam now but I have 83 'officially' due to some being profile limited (small indie games, particularly horrors tend to not count).

  
Phasmophobia (80ish hours), Spider-Man Remastered (60ish) and Battlefield 4 (70ish) took the longest. The First Descendant I was around 60 hours or so when I unlocked all the achievements I think. Modern Warfare 2 is a cheap one as COD split out the game so I had already got the achievements and that updated and unlocked them all. Still missing one last one for Modern Warfare 3.

  
Most enjoyable ones? Hail to the Rainbow, Coffee Talk and I personally really liked Moon Mystery. KARMA, ROUTINE and She's Leaving solid horror games. 

Plenty of other games that are still 'in progress' and working on at the moment! 

  
First time doing an end of year roundup - used to collect more on Xbox years ago but started to properly get more into it last year. Here's to 2026 and all growing our completed achievement collections! 

Happy New Year!

I've tried regular sports drinks but the sugar makes me crash hard mid-shift. I've tried drinking more plain water but I just end up needing bathroom breaks I don't have time for. I need something that keeps me hydrated without the sugar crash or constant bathroom trips.
The budget is flexible if it actually works. I'm spending money on coffee and energy drinks trying to push through shifts when I know the real problem is dehydration.

1q0h8fc,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviewhammer/comments/1q0h8fc/i_get_accepted_in_almost_every_interview_i_do/,"I get accepted in almost every interview I do. This is my method, ask me anything.","I've always killed it in interviews, and honestly, I think it's because I treat them more like a chat than a test. It seems like everything is about the vibe these days, so this is the method that works for me.

I practiced a lot of impromptu speaking when I was younger, and that made me able to think quickly and answer right away. Get a friend and have them throw random topics at you, and try to talk about each one for two minutes. It can be anything. This is the same skill you use in your everyday conversations and it helps you articulate your thoughts clearly and concisely.

You have to do research on the company. You don't need to write a doctoral thesis for the initial screening calls or the first few rounds. When you have 6 other interviews in the same week, that's impossible anyway. My method: I spend 45 minutes the night before looking at their website, their latest news, and their mission. Then, I do a quick 10-minute refresh right before the call. This is more than enough to show that you've done your homework.

I've never been great at dealing with authority figures; that's just my personality. This attitude, and the idea that I'm the expert in the room, is what always keeps me calm. I tell myself they need me way more than I need them. Look, it's all just business. They have a problem (a vacant position) and I am the solution. When you see yourself as the prize, you act accordingly.

You're the one driving this. You set the direction. A large number of interviewers are just winging it. If you sense that, don't be afraid to politely take the reins. Something like: 'Hi Jane, I know we need to wrap up at the top of the hour, so I want to make sure we cover the most important points. I'd like to explain how my experience is a fit for this role, hear your vision, and then I have a few questions for you. Sound good?'. This is a power move and it works every time.

Make them laugh. Seriously. Relax, lean back in your chair (even if it's on Zoom), and talk like a normal human being. Even in a very corporate setting, you'll feel the interviewer loosen up if you're relaxed. Don't be a clown, just be in control but casual. Your mission is to make them have one good laugh at least. People say to talk about your coffee mug or whatever, and that's fine, but when you're the person who made them laugh during a long day of canned answers, that's what makes them remember you.

Now for the substance itself. Your whole life story isn't important, but you need a narrative. I use two methods: either I walk them through my career path chronologically, then tie everything to the 8 core skills they want, or I talk about each job and highlight the specific skills from the description that I used there. Don't list way more skills than they asked for; you'll seem overqualified and they'll be intimidated. And you absolutely must have your questions prepared, or else all of this is pointless. Prepare 3 or 4 smart questions that make them really think. Don't ask about team structure or company culture - they're tired of those questions. If you absolutely must, you can ask the hiring manager what made them join the company, but that's it.

Rejection is just redirection. You can kill it in every stage of the interview and still not get the job. It's happened to me, and it can destroy your confidence. You have to remind yourself that you can do everything right and still not succeed. That's just how it goes sometimes. You have to get back up on your feet. For context, I'm a senior-level pro and for my entire career, I've been headhunted. I've never had to apply for a job myself. But I left a toxic job last November and was unemployed from December 15th to February 20th. I submitted around 550 applications, did over 70 interviews, reached 12 final rounds, and only got 5 offers. It was a grind and a mess for my psyche. But I told myself that the companies that rejected me don't understand real talent, and that's their problem. Many places just want a cog in a machine, not someone truly skilled. It's their loss.

It's normal to feel nervous. I still get nervous 10 minutes before any call. Give yourself a moment to breathe before and after. They asked to speak with you for a reason - they already see potential in you. Your job is to show them they were right. The only mindset you need is this: 'I'm good at talking. These people are going to hear a lot from me. They are literally getting paid to sit here and listen to me. I might say something stupid, but who cares? They have to put up with me for the next 30 minutes anyway.'

1q0h7ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q0h7ci/parking_tips_for_robert_morris_university/,parking tips for robert morris university colonials mens hockey vs. sacred heart pioneers men's ice hockey at clearview arena (pittsburgh 01/03),"  
hey folks, figured i'd share some parking advice for the sacred heart game this friday, 01/03, at 4:00 pm. clearview arena hockey is honestly super fun, but the one real pain is getting on and off neville island. it's not the cost of parking you worry about, it's the traffic backing up on grand avenue when everyone leaves at once.  
  
first thing, i gotta mention Prked. it's the app for renting driveways/garages right next to the rmu island sports center. even though official parking is free, paying a little on Prked guarantees you a spot that lets you bypass the main lot's internal traffic line for a super fast jump onto the road when the game ends, and the walk is literally nothing. it's the best way to skip the official lot congestion and the island bottleneck.  
  
the main and official way to go is the ample free parking available on-site at the rmu island sports center. all rmu athletic events offer free parking for fans, and they have a decent amount of space right outside the main entrance of clearview arena, which is super convenient for the walk.  
  
the biggest tip i can give is all about timing and that island bottleneck. the arena only seats about 1,200, but it's located on neville island, and access is via i-79 or the yellow belt onto grand avenue- that's where you'll hit traffic, both before and after the game. for a 4:00 pm puck drop, honestly aim to be on neville island by 3:15 pm to make sure you snag a close free spot and miss the main traffic wave coming over the bridge. don't bother looking for street parking near the complex- it's on a sports center property, so it's not a real option like it is in the city.  
  
if you park in the main free lots, remember that getting off neville island right after the final horn can be a slow crawl. your best problem avoidance move is to hang out at the icehouse bistro for a bit and let the initial wave of cars clear out instead of sitting in the exit line. they have coffee and pub fare there.  
  
hope this helps you catch a good win against sacred heart!",1,1767198926.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

We recently adopted a stray cat. The cat was originally found in the back shop of my job's mechanic shop after jumping out of the engine bay of a car that drove there. Some staff members and I had to capture the cat since it's an extremely unsafe environment (took 3 days to find it, alongside 2 hours of getting it to run into a box). 

I decided to adopt it after the endeavors, and it's been at our apartment for 3 weeks now. I placed its kennel in my bathroom (now the cat's room), got her a soft blanket, 2 cans of wet food a day, a clean litter box, and daily fresh water. I've also been leaving some churu in its food bowl every other feeding. Touch has been kept to a minimum. I've been allowed a head scratch and chin scratch every so often, but it hisses at me sometimes still. No swatting or scratching yet. I try my best to respect its space. 

Recently, I've been keeping the bathroom door open so if it wants, it can explore our recently cat proofed apartment. It's only come out once to hide in the TV cabinet before running back to its kennel after dad #2 got up for his coffee. 

This is not my first adopted cat, but this is my first one that's more than a few weeks old. I've only ever taken in kittens before this. Is there any advice anyone can lend towards getting it more comfortable with us? Apparently, before I adopted it, it ""belonged"" to a woman that would regularly feed strays outside of her house (dozens of them!). This is my first time having trouble with a cat easing into a household, so I am quite nervous about overstepping. Thank you very much everyone! Have a happy new year as well!

1q0h0lr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Leather-Buddy-7902/comments/1q0h0lr/the_mindbending_moment_when_special_relativity/,The mind-bending moment when Special Relativity finally clicked (and the math sang!),"Okay, so there I was, deep into my physics degree, drowning in differential equations and tensor notation. My brain felt like a soggy sponge, especially when we hit Special Relativity. Length contraction? Time dilation? Simultaneity is relative? My common sense was screaming, and the equations on the page, while elegant, felt like abstract alien poetry with no real connection to, well, *reality*.

I remember one particularly brutal evening, slumped over a textbook, a cold coffee long forgotten beside me. I was trying to wrap my head around the Lorentz transformations, those seemingly innocuous equations that twist space and time like taffy. My eyes glazed over, the symbols blurring into an indecipherable mess. I just couldn't *feel* it. It was just math, detached from the physical universe I was trying to understand.

Then, my professor, a quiet genius with a penchant for bizarre analogies, pulled out a laser pointer during a lecture. He didn't just write equations; he made us *visualize* light cones, events in spacetime. He talked about how two observers, moving relative to each other, would genuinely *experience* time and space differently, not just perceive it. It wasn't an illusion; it was the fabric of the universe itself behaving that way.

And something just... clicked. It wasn't a slow dawning; it was like a sudden, bright flash. The math wasn't just describing weird phenomena; it *was* the weird phenomena. The elegance of the equations suddenly wasn't just abstract beauty; it was the underlying symphony of the cosmos. My brain felt like it had been physically reshaped, expanded by this new, mind-blowing truth. It was a dizzying, exhilarating moment of pure, unadulterated intellectual awe.

Suddenly, the universe felt both more mysterious and profoundly more understandable. The equations, once cold and unyielding, now hummed with meaning, a direct line to how reality fundamentally operates. It wasn't just solving problems anymore; it was like peering behind the curtain of existence itself.

Here’s how to fix it,"If your Dreame can physically fito under a couch, bed, or coffee table but won’t actually clean there, that’s normal behavior. The robot is being cautious, not broken.

What actually works:

• **Add a curtain zone under the furniture**  
This is the most reliable fix. Curtain zones tell the robot to ignore side sensors and fully commit to cleaning that area.

• **Turn on Intensive / Extreme coverage for one run**  
This lowers avoidance sensitivity and makes the robot more willing to enter tight spaces.

• **Zone clean the area 1–2 times**  
Force it to clean under the furniture a couple times. After successful runs, it often includes the area in normal cleans.

• **Remove auto-added furniture icons**  
If the app added a sofa/table object, delete it and run a full clean so the robot re-evaluates the space.

• **Temporarily raise the furniture (optional but effective)**  
Lift it 10–15 mm with coasters or blocks, run a clean, then remove them. This helps the robot “learn” the clearance.

What usually doesn’t help:

• Remapping alone  
• Lidar retraction by itself  
• Turning off cliff sensors

Bottom line:  
The robot needs confidence, not just clearance. Once you force a few successful passes using the steps above, it usually behaves normally going forward.",10,1767198361.0,Dreame_Tech,0,0.92,False
1q0gym1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1q0gym1/gear_list_bugoutbag_tailored_for_hotel/,Gear list: Bug-Out-Bag tailored for hotel,"This list was requested in a different post.  I’m posting it here for easier searching.  I’m on mobile, so hopefully this will format correctly.

My bug-out-bags are tailored for an unplanned hotel stay.  I travel for work nearly every week, and stay in hotels at least 20 nights per month, so the content of my bags includes things that I routinely carry to make life in a hotel much more comfortable.

If you have the luxury of choosing which hotel you stay in, look for an extended stay hotel.  These have fully furnished kitchenettes in each room and many properties offer a hot breakfast buffet in the lobby.  Often, the rooms are similar to small apartments and are more spacious than standard hotel rooms.  The kitchenette can make a huge impact to your food budget since you’ll be able to cook your own meals.

If you can’t find an extended stay hotel, look for one that offers a hot breakfast buffet included in the room cost.  A Continental breakfast is typically just some cereal and pastries, a hot breakfast makes a huge difference.

If possible, request a room on floors 3-5.  The ground floor and 2nd floor aren’t  as secure as a higher floor, but you don’t want to be too high up if you need to use the stairs instead of the elevator.

My bags are intended as bug-out-bags.  I fully expect that I will need to buy more clothes and supplies once I get settled somewhere.  The bag is intended to get me through a few days.

So, what’s in the bag?

Critical items:

$200 in small bills
A written list of phone numbers for friends and family 
A written list of phone numbers for banks and insurance 
A password protected USB drive with critical documents
An expired ID card
A photocopy of current ID card
A $3000 limit credit card with no balance
1-2 weeks of prescription meds

These are stored in a fire resistant zipper pouch in my bag.  If I don’t have my wallet or phone, as long as I grab my bag, I should still be able to secure a place to stay and contact the people I need.

Clothes:

1 pair of jeans
2 short sleeve tee shirts
1 long sleeve button-down shirt
4 pairs of socks 
4 pairs of underwear 
1 bra
1 long sleeve tee shirt for sleeping 
1 pair of pajama pants with pockets
1 hoodie
1 pair of swim socks or flip flops
1 packable rain jacket 

If there is room in the bag:
1 large Turkish bath towel or large shawl

This wardrobe will get me through a few days (including what I’m wearing when I leave my home).  I can handwash clothes in my hotel room as needed and everything can be washed together in a single load of laundry.  When I’m in a hotel, I always want pajama pants with pockets. I don’t always want to get dressed fully if I need to go down to the lobby for some tea or a snack.  I have also had to evacuate my hotel room on 5 occasions, 3 for fire alarms, 2 for tornado warnings.  Having pockets that I can drop my phone and room key in is really nice.  The swim socks give better traction in the shower than flip flops or they can be worn as slippers.  The towel is nice to have, hotel towels suck.

Sleep:

1 sleep mask
2 pairs of earplugs that I can sleep in
5 medium sized binder clips
1 roll of painters tape
5 index cards
1 mini white-noise machine (about the size of a small pill bottle)
1 USB-C rechargeable flat desk fan (it’s only about 1/2 inch thick)
2 large rubber door stops

If there is room in the budget:
Good quality earbuds made for sleeping (I use Ozlo)

I’m a light sleeper.  If my room isn’t dark, I cannot sleep.  If there is a random noise, I will wake up.  Sleep masks are ok, but I often can’t sleep well with one, so I try to minimize the amount of light in the room.  Binder clips are used to keep the curtains closed, painters tape is used to tape the curtain edge to the wall if needed.  The index cards are used (with tape) to cover the stupidly bright microwave display and the stupidly bright bedside clock (some clocks can just be turned face-down).  I’ve used towels for this in the past, but there have been fewer towels provided lately.  My desk fan can make a huge difference in the quality of sleep I get, especially if the room is too hot.  One door stop is wedged under the door to slow entry (the security bar is also put in place whenever I’m in my room), the other is used to prop open the bathroom door if needed.

Comfort / Quality of life:

1 snap together valet tray that folds completely flat 
2 charging bricks with multiple USB ports
3 6-10 foot long USB charging cables 
1 15 foot HDMI cable
1 adapter to connect HDMI cable to phone or iPad (used to connect my iPad to the TV)
1 collapsible silicone bowl with lid that is microwave safe
1 set of cutlery 
1 collapsible silicone mug that is heat resistant
1 eyedrop bottle with Dawn dish soap (well labeled and no where near my eyedrops)
1 dish washing rag with scrubbing surface

If there is room in the bag:
1 Stanley French Press coffee mug
1 travel kettle 
1 camp pillow/toddler pillow (hotel pillows are way too soft)
1 fleece sleeping bag liner (doubles as an extra blanket)
1 rechargeable motion sensor light (either a closet light or under-cabinet light)
1 plastic microwaveable dinner plate

The valet tray is always set up in the same spot regardless of where I am: it goes next to the TV.  The tray is where my room key, car keys, pouch with critical items, and wallet are placed whenever I’m in my room.  If I need to evacuate my hotel room, I don’t have to search for these critical things.  The motion sensor light is great as a nightlight.  There isn’t always a logical place to plug in an actual nightlight and the battery powered light is great for a power outage.

The microwave can be used to cook a lot of things.  As long as you have a bowl and some cutlery, you can avoid eating every meal at a restaurant.

Minor emergencies (power outage, illness, etc.):

1 boo-boo kit to treat minor cuts, blisters, hang nails, etc. (mine is in an old coin purse)
1 manicure kit 
1 small sewing kit that includes a few buttons
1 pack of iron-on clothing patches
1 eyeglass repair kit
1 week of multivitamins
1 small med kit to treat pain, allergies, stomach issues, and other minor medical issues 
1 small bottle of Melatonin 
1 pen light
1 headlamp 
1 paperback book I can re-read many times 
1 battery pack to recharge phone and other electronics 
1 water bottle with backwoods filter (I like Epic)
2 quart size ziplock freezer bags
2 gallon size ziplock freezer bags

There have been several power outages during my many hotel stays.  Of course, you never really know how long power will be out, so I do not use my phone for light or entertainment during an outage.  A headlamp can be taped to a full water bottle (light shining into the bottle) to make a nice lantern.  All of my electronics can be charged on the battery pack (including white noise machine, fan, and Kindle).  If you have a car, remember that you can also charge your things in your car (people often forget this).  The freezer bags can be used to make ice packs or a hot compress.

Laundry:

1 roll of quarters (often you can’t get change at the front desk)
5 laundry detergent sheets 
5 dryer sheets 
1 camping clothes line
1 laundry stain pen
1 eyedropper of unscented Castile soap (for washing by hand)

Store laundry supplies in 1 gallon ziplock freezer bag, bag can be used as a basin for hand washing laundry if needed

Food and water:

1 water bottle with backwoods rated filter (mentioned above)
1 Sawyer Mini Squeeze
Instant oatmeal packets 
Dried soup packets 
Shelf-stable snacks like peanut butter crackers, granola bars, protein bars
Hard candies
Tea bags and sugar packets 
Instant coffee “sticks”
Electrolyte “sticks”
Sample size ground coffee (to use in the French Press)

Always have some snacks in your bag, don’t rely on places being open or well stocked when your emergency happens.  When adrenaline wears off, I’m usually very hungry.  Always have a way to get clean water.  Hotel coffee is usually very disappointing, so I typically pack my own.  

Toiletries:

1 bar shampoo/body wash
1 travel bottle lotion 
1 travel hair brush 
1 toothbrush 
1 travel toothpaste
1 travel deodorant

Most hotels will be able to supply the toiletries you need (including toothbrushes and razors), so don’t over-pack here.

Cold weather:

1 packable puffy jacket 
1 wool beanie
1 pair of winter gloves
1 wool Buff
4 packs of Hot Hands toe warmers (can be used for hands or feet)
2 packs of Hot Hands body warmers (can be used as a heating pad as well)

I may have forgotten to list a few things, but in general, these things have made hotel living much more enjoyable.  Unless things have gone very wrong, I should be able to get more supplies if needed within a day or two of evacuating.  My clothing list is intended for a few days and doing laundry.  My food list is intended for one or two days then grocery shopping (or restaurants).  This bag is intended for evacuating or traveling on short notice because a family member is in the hospital.

I don't think I'm likely to have time for artisanal coffee making any time soon and even if I did, my wife has no interest in doing so.

So to this Simonelli Oscar, it's probably a gen 1 model (2015 ish?).  There's no digital display, it's a plastic finish and it's a heat exchanger model.

It comes with 2 portafilters (single and dual), a VST precision basket and a calibrated tamper.

The tank and the recommended pressure valve upgrade would tack on another $100-150cad.

Given it's age, I'm assuming that it needs some significant tlc work with o-rings and other fiddly bits.  I'm also assuming it works, which is a bit of a big assumption for a 10 year old model I guess.

Other than this, I'd probably be looking at a bambino because the next level of ""push the idiot button to make coffee"" kicks in well above $1k and there's no way my wife is going to allow me to spend that on a machine...

Note:  Our current machine is used for 2 drinks in the morning and maybe 2 drinks in the evening.  Typically Americano, cafe late and the occasional espresso.

The past few years, his Christmas gifts to us have become pretty generous, like several hundred dollars per niece/nephew even though there’s 11 of us total. Usually he has given the money to my mom who had asked us what we wanted from him and then bought it so we would have something under the Christmas tree. However, most of us are full grown adults in our mid twenties, so that arrangement doesn’t really work as well now. This year, money has been extremely tight for me, and I’m at risk of getting evicted. But I still scraped together what little I had, to buy small gifts for people. 

My mom texted me and told me how much money this relative had given her for each kid this year ($250), and asked me what I wanted. I asked her if it’s ok can she just give me the cash and it will mean more to me than any random appliance or piece of clothing worth the same amount of money. She refused, saying it’s not christmassy, he is going to wonder why I am not unwrapping a physical gift, Christmas isn’t about getting other people to pay your bills. She said it’s not her fault my money is so tight, and she won’t give me the money, so either I pick something or I don’t get a gift at all. I left the conversation at that, hoping I could convince her if I tried again later. 
A week later she texted me a picture of some random coffee maker I would never use in my life and said “what about this?” I told her it looked lovely but it’s not really something I would use. She said if I don’t choose something, this is what I’m going to get. I replied somewhat rudely and said it would be useless to have an expensive coffee machine if I don’t even have an apartment because I get kicked out. She never responded to me.

Then, a few days before Christmas, she told me in person she is just going to give me the cash since apparently all I want is money from my loved ones. But then she never gave me the money. 

I was at their home all week and I asked her once before Christmas when she wasn’t busy, if she would have a chance to give it to me and she said she would later. Then Christmas came and I had nothing under the tree from that relative so I knew she must still have the cash for me. I waited until the 28th, so as to not be pushy and to let her relax on Christmas, then asked her again if I could have my money. She again said yes she will get around to giving it to me and was extremely annoyed. I leave to go back home tomorrow, so today I had to ask her again about it and this time she said she had already given it to me!! She said “you asked me two days ago and I gave it to you then.” This never happened! She claims after that conversation she went and put the envelope in my room on top of my things. I never saw an envelope and she never told me of this. Now she’s saying it’s my fault for losing the envelope.

I think she’s lying to me and she somehow doesn’t have the money any more. But I really really could use it. And I feel hurt about being lied to. As far as I know, this is not really in character for her either. She has almost never, in all the years I’ve known her, been dishonest like that.

I also enjoyed ""The Long Walk"", which brings up an interesting point.  The two 'best Stephen King' movies I've seen were both published as ""Bachman books"". 
    Things that make you say, 'hmmm'.  Is Bachman more 'film- ready' than King?

1q0gvdu,https://i.redd.it/6k1vjjw7fkag1.jpeg,the only way I can make marshmallow melt bearable 🙂,"Plum Marshmallow Melt lotion and Al rehab french coffee y'all🌝

I ordered Marshmallow Melt lotion from blinkit cus I had gotten bored of the vanilla caramello one. Cut to 15 mins later , i tried it and was disappointed 🥲. It was sweet as hell cus well, marshmallows. I expected that cus it's what ppl said on here as well. But what I didn't expect was that it would be sorta Bubblegum-y and bright, with barely any warmth. Unlike vanilla caramello which evidently has some warmth to it. Although it doesn't smell much like caramel to me💀💀.           I pretty much decided that I'll wear marshmallow melt in the summers cus of how bright and almost cough syrupy it smells. This is how the lotions smell to my nose , so do share your opinions as well✊🏾✊🏾

Now coming to french coffee. Its the second attar i hv after choco musk. I bought it mid November and in the place I live, winter hadn't hit the way it does now. The weather was quite hot still, so french coffee smelled RAANNKK😭. I could barely smell the coffee. All i could smell was this pungent coconut smell. Like the lotte coconut punch toffee. It's a good smell ig, but not in the attar. Not for me. So I didn't use it for a while. BUT NOW. it's proper WINTER. So I gave it a try once again and WOOAHHH😭🛐. I love ittt. I don't smell the coconut as much anymore. Just coffee. Warm, milky and slightly bitter. I find my myself sniffing my wrists then and there. As a coffee addict, I'm relieved that I like it now🥹

I tried the attar with the lotions I have - Plum Vanilla Caramello, Marshmallow Melt and McCaffiene Choco body lotion. 

I find that it's a good way to make use of that bigass bottle of Marshmallow Melt, cus the bitterness and warmth from french coffee cancel out the cloying sugary sweetness and brightness of the lotion. It's a pretty good balance. I suppose it's what bubblegum lattes smell like. WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW WAS A THING UNTIL RECENTLY😭😭",10,1767198089.0,desifemfrag,7,0.86,False
1q0guzz,https://i.redd.it/hmkb2955fkag1.jpeg,GMT 2 Zombie 🧟 Kicking off a 7-day trip crossing Canada and Asia the right way ✈️🌍,"Quick snap before heading out, rocking the GMT-Master II “Zombie” on the wrist. As a pilot bouncing across time zones, this watch just gets it local time, home time, and zero excuses for being late to briefing.

The Zombie felt especially appropriate for this trip: long overnights, circadian rhythm destroyed, living on crew meals and hotel coffee… basically flying around half-alive already 🧟‍♂️✈️. If you see someone staring at their wrist trying to remember what day it is, that’s me.

Love how the GMT isn’t just a hype piece it’s genuinely built for travel and aviation, and it’s cool knowing it’s doing exactly what it was designed to do while crossing continents.

Happy New Year to everyone, safe flying to my fellow pilots, and smooth time zone changes to all the GMT owners out there.

Cheers and blue skies.",5,1767198061.0,rolex,2,0.86,False
1q0gush,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0gush,The boss in this commercial was actually the jerk here,"So in this Allstate commercial, this Georgia Bulldogs fan sees that his boss is also a UGA fan from the coffee mug she’s drinking out of, and gives her the bark and sick em cheer, which is of course familiar to all dawgs fans. Instead of reciprocating his show of passion for the dawgs, she’s gives him an uncomfortable look on passing and continues talking about the TPS reports. This was a missed opportunity by the lady boss to foster a welcoming atmosphere in the work place, by which then ostracized the guy, as evidenced by his coworker calling him “bark boy” later in the commercial. This commercial should be used by HR staffs everywhere as an example of what not to do by leadership when engaged by underlings in non-workplace banter. 

Also, I’m sorry, I don’t hate this commercial. It was executed to perfection and cleverly written. Go dawgs, sick em, ru ru ru.",45,1767198047.0,CommercialsIHate,67,0.67,False

He recently expressed that he would love to see a video of the terminal in action. I know it wasn’t active for very long, but would anyone have any old videos of the terminal in use? Or know where to find them on YouTube?

Additionally, his bday is in March and I’d love to get him a coffee table book of photos of the terminal from its construction to now, does anyone know of anything like this that exists?

I’ll check with the museum center too, but I figured there have to be some train / union terminal enthusiasts here who can point me in the correct direction. ",1,1767198045.0,cincinnati,3,0.67,False

We met because he works for a customer of my company and i was involved in the rollout of our product, thus i was providing hands on support at their location during the first few weeks. we met when he came to the department where i was stationed with a few issues and i helped him out together with a colleague. after he left, my colleague immediately made jokes like “i didn’t know if i should’ve left you alone, not like either of you noticed i was there at all“. so needless to say, he and i hit it of instantly. for the first few weeks i came to his office nearly every day since he gave me a open invite to get coffee since we didn’t have our own coffee maker and he always asked when i‘d be the company next so he could see me again. at the end of the first few weeks, the little coffee meet ups evolved to me bringing him a little sweet treat and him immediately abandoning all his work to talk with the 30+ minutes about our private lives etc.

after this phase i‘m now at his company about once a month and i always go by his office since he keeps inviting me to do so („next time you‘re here, come by, since i should have my new carpet by then.“ „i‘ll give you an update next time your here on xy.“). he also dropped other hints like telling me „seeing me at his office door is one of the highlights of his work day.“ and when i told him i‘d be coming by less, saying he‘d tell my company he needed so much support with the product that they‘d have me work from his office to help him constantly.

this all sounds super nice and i really like this guy, but he has not asked me out once or even asked for my number. i know he is single and he keeps alluding to communicating outside of these coffee hang outs, but then doesn’t follow through. e.g. when i told him i‘d be off for a few weeks and won’t even look at my work mails (jokingly bragging since he had to work), he said that he‘d have to send me a mail before the start of the holiday to ensure he has a way to get in touch with me while i‘m off work. he didn’t send the mail. other times he hasn’t said he‘d mail me about something and hasn’t done it either. when i have to mail him for work stuff, i try to include a little personal question at the end (asking about his holiday or whatever) and he never responds either.

i have tried to drop hints about going to dinner together or other stuff but he hasn’t outright asked me to do anything together. i don’t want to just ask him out since he still works for the customer so it would be a bit crass from my side (not forbidden, a colleague of mine started dating a girl at their company after the first few weeks we were stationed there and our boss just laughed).

so any advice? is he even into me or am i delusional? i really like him but am getting sick and tired of being strung along. what can i do? drop him or try something else?",0,1767198018.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False
