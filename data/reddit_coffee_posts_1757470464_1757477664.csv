1nd4fl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nd4fl4/highscore_part_1/,Highscore Part 1,"I was just 24 years old, not even one month into the FBI, when my partner and I discovered the man who would become the most prolific serial killer in history. This was back in 2013, when the dark web and its market for drugs, weapons, and child exploitation were on the rise. The FBI was just beginning to make arrests for crimes conducted via the dark web.

My partner, a few cops, and I were sent to a location in Nowthen, Minnesota, after tracing the IP address of some creep buying child exploitation material online. It was a gray, drizzling Saturday evening when we pulled up to the suspect’s residence. It was a rundown, one-story house with an overgrown lawn and dirty walls.

My partner, Agent Kraton, banged on the door, announcing, “This is the FBI. We need to talk, Mr. Sully. We have a warrant and will enter forcibly.”

I thought I could just make out the sound of rapid, heavy footsteps from within the home. Kraton rolled his eyes; his graying mustache twitched as he said to me, “Hey Lou, you mind running around back real quick?”

“Uh, okay.” I ran around the house, my hand on my holstered weapon.

In the back, I found a scrawny, balding man in a tank top crawling out a window. “Back here!” I roared. I sprinted toward him and tackled him before he could start running.

An hour later, we were in the Minneapolis FBI headquarters. The perv was sitting alone in a cell, and I was in a darkened computer lab sifting through his confiscated computer.

Kraton came in and handed me a mug of coffee. “Anything on his monitor?”

“No. Looks like he managed to wipe his history.”

“Doesn’t really matter. We traced the purchases to this device’s IP address, and that’s enough.”

Kraton nodded. “That’s good, but take a look at this.” He handed me a flash drive. It was bent and cracked but looked like it would still function.

The perv had it in his pocket as he was making a break for it. He was thumping his ass around on the seat of the car. At first, I thought he was high, but then I realized he was trying to destroy something in his pocket.

I plugged the drive in and, after screening for viruses, started looking through the files. Most of them were adult content—artwork, photos, videos. Some of it was legal; some was definitely illegal.

Kraton crossed himself a couple of times as we slogged through the filth. “I’ll never understand,” he murmured, shaking his head, “how someone can get this sick.”

At the end of the flash drive’s contents was a file folder simply titled **High Score**.

I thought, *What the hell does that mean?*

“High score?” I asked.

“I suppose we better find out. Someone’s got to testify.”

I clicked on the folder. It opened to a list of MP4 files, each labeled: Episode 13, Episode 17, Episode 18, and so on. The numbers were almost continuous but jumped occasionally.

“Watch, it’ll just be pirated Glee episodes,” I muttered and clicked on the first one.

The screen showed a first-person video of someone with black sleeves and gloves revving up a chainsaw. Then AC/DC’s *Thunderstruck* started blaring. The video went through a montage of images as the hard rock song played:

* Night vision footage of walking through the woods
* Black-clad hands loading shells into a long-barreled shotgun
* Twirling a butterfly knife
* Loading an arrow to a plastic composite bow
* The shadow of a man running through a dimly lit sewer tunnel
* Footage of the games *Pacman*, *Doom*, *Call of Duty*, and one other I didn’t recognize

Words appeared over the images: *Killstreak presents*. A shot of a lightning bolt over wind-swept trees followed by a black screen and a title card: **High Score** in dripping red letters—just as the AC/DC song dropped its dramatic refrain.

The whole sequence was obviously homemade but rather well done.

“This should be interesting,” Kraton muttered.

The screen and song faded to a video of a man dressed completely in black—black tactical gear, black hoodie, black boots and gloves. Only his skull mask was a dull gray. One side of the mask had a video camera built into it, the lens set over the mask’s left eye.

“Hey everyone, before we get to the action, I just want to thank y’all from the bottom of my heart,” said the man. His voice had a metallic, resonating echo—he was clearly using a voice changer. Despite that, there was a clear Southern twang to his voice.

“I couldn’t do what I do without your support. If I had a day job, I couldn’t travel, I couldn’t practice my art as much as I get to, and I couldn’t bring you these videos. Y’all know my dream — to be the very best at what I do — and I can pursue that dream thanks to you guys. I just want y’all to know you’re all the best. And if you have a dream, you should do whatever you can to make it a reality.”

The video switched to first-person footage of someone thumping through the woods at night. A set of digital numbers marked the date: August 25th, 2009. Occasionally, the camera panned down to the cameraman’s arm carrying a large duffel bag.

The cameraman arrived at the edge of a clearing. There was a quaint farmhouse in the middle of the field. Light came from just one window on the second story.

“Today we’re working from Missouri. I spent a couple of days scouting this home. It belongs to an old couple named John and Alice Walker. They don’t interact with the locals often. I learned a bit about them by watching them last night and some by just asking the locals.”

The video flashed to another first-person image: a bar in front of a pool table. Two middle-aged men stood on the other side of the table.

“Looks like he’s using a button cam,” Kraton whispered.

A voice, probably the same as the narrator’s, said, “Hey, as I was driving, I saw this really nice light green house in a clearing a few miles north of here. Don’t suppose it’s for sale?”

The audience was someone distorted.

“No,” said one of the bearded men as he aimed a pool cue. “Belongs to some old couple, I think. The man was a lawyer. They’re retired now, far as I know. They’re sort of shy—never see them in church or town halls.”

Then the video flashed back to the woods and farmhouse at night.

The narrator said, “When you’re gathering information about a target, it’s important to be subtle. Try to mask your interest in your target — like how I pretended to be interested in the house — and don’t pursue the subject too far. You don’t want people remembering how you were asking all about the target the day before they turned up dead.”

My eyes widened, and I turned from the video to my partner, Kraton.

“Are we watching a murder?”

The cameraman jogged from the edge of the clearing toward the farmhouse. He circled around to a basement window, then pulled a glass cutter out of his bag. He silently cut a semicircle in the window and climbed into the house’s basement, pulling his duffel bag in after him.

“After starting the gas, I wait for 30 minutes in the basement, but I’ll skip that part for you guys,” said the voice over the video.

The video flashed, and then the cameraman returned to the kitchen and pulled out a small device that looked like a lighter. He held it up for the camera.

“This little beauty,” the voice said, “I rigged up in my shop just for this kill. I press a button — a button on a remote control I have in my bag — and this wire here will yank the switch and turn the lighter on. Usually useless, but if you light it inside a house where the stove’s been on too long, well, then things get interesting.”

He placed it on the kitchen counter, then snuck back downstairs, leaving the basement door open. He went to the window and started punching the glass.

“There’s going to be an explosion. Kitchen windows will break. I broke the glass here to make it look like the explosion blew the basement glass from the inside,” explained the narrator.

Then the cameraman climbed out, ran a dozen meters away from the house, turned around, pulled a remote controller out of his bag, popped open a cap, and pressed a button.

There was an explosion. The house’s windows lit up red. The kitchen windows indeed shattered, and a roaring inferno streamed out of them.

The cameraman watched as the house burned. Over the roar of the flames, you could just make out the screams.

After about a minute, the cameraman turned and ran into the woods. You could just hear sirens blaring in the distance.

“And that, my friends, makes kill numbers 18 and 19. I just beat Jeffrey Dahmer’s record,” he said.

Red digital numbers imposed themselves over the footage, saying:

**High Scores**  
Luis Garavito – 199

Pedro Lopez – 110

Javed Iqbal – 100

Mikhail Popkov – 83

Yang Xinhai – 67

Gary Ridgeway – 49

John Wayne Gacy – 33

Ted Bundy – 20

Killstreak – 19

Jeffrey Dahmer – 17

The video switched to a title card: **High Score** and then ended.

Kraton and I shared a horrified look. “How many episodes are there?” he whispered.

I exited the video and scrolled down the files — 92.

Over the next few hours, Kraton and I watched every single one of those videos. Not all the episodes were on the drive; we only got a total of 52 episodes in.

In every episode, this Killstreak killed at least one person, sometimes two, three, or more. Sometimes he made it look like an accident — fire, gas leaks, falls, hit and runs. He also liked to drug people and then make it look like they shot or hung themselves. He was always scrupulous to record his own handiwork but disguised it to any investigators. Other times, he would stab, snipe, or even shoot his victims with a bow and arrow. Bow hunting was his favorite.

He would proudly record himself burying or hiding the bodies, and he was good at that part too. He regularly talked about forensics and police procedures and how to hide from them.

His favorite trick was to buy a dog from a shelter and kill it. Then he would bury the human body in a deep grave, cover it up partly, and bury the dog over it. Thus, if police dogs ever found the dig site, they would find the dead dog, assume that was all there was, and move on.

He picked his targets by how easily he could kill them and hide his tracks. Most of his victims were lonely old couples, homeless folks, hunters, and campers, but he had no preference for age, sex, race, or religion. “You’re not racist if you hate everybody equally,” he laughed in episode 37, where he killed a gay black couple by shooting through the bedroom window of their lakeside cabin with a suppressed sniper rifle.

He traveled around the country, literally throwing darts at a paper map to pick which county he would hit. He lived in a small RV camper, which occasionally appeared in his videos, but the license plate was always blurred out.

He always put dates on his episodes. The earliest was August 25th, 2009; the most recent was September 18th, 2013. They were almost always between 6 and 30 minutes long.

There was always footage of a murder, but sometimes before or after the killing, he would film himself — always in his skull mask — and make an announcement about the channel or opine on his favorite guns, video games, and serial killers throughout history.

With the collection of episodes on the flash drive, we had evidence for 59 kills. But by episode 92, he claimed to have 111 kills.

In that episode, he simply walks around Central Park in New York City one night, jabbing a concealed hunting knife into the temples of three separate junkies as they slept on park benches.

At the end, the video flashed over to him — still with his black hoodie and video camera skull mask — sitting at a table inside his RV. “Guys, last night I beat Pedro Lopez’s record. Pedro Lopez, the Monster of the Andes, had 110 kills. I have 111. This makes me”...... “This makes me the second greatest serial killer who ever lived. I want to thank all of you for being with me along the way. As far as we know, the pigs are still clueless. They have no idea what we’ve been doing. And what we’ve done is truly special. I’m so proud of myself, and I’m so proud of y’all too. But we’ve still got a ways to go if I’m going to make it to the very top.

Luis Garavito had 193 confirmed kills, which means I have 83 to go if I want to top that. The fun is nowhere near finished.

And uh, before I sign out, I just want to say — I didn’t used to believe in God or faith, or I thought if there was a God, he didn’t care about me. But now, well, I think that if you have a dream, that’s a gift. That’s a gift from God. And if you work hard at achieving it, if you prove yourself worthy, he will reward you.

So I’ll just say this — God bless each and every one of you. I love y’all, and uh, good night.”

The last video on the flash drive ended.

Kraton and I shared a wide-eyed look. “What was the date on that last one?” he asked me. “September 18th. Five days ago,” I whispered.

“I think we better make some calls.”",1,1757477347.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1nd4fd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nd4fd5/aita_for_supporting_my_best_friends_decision_to/,AITA for supporting my best friend’s decision to divorce her husband instead of convincing her to stay like her parents asked me to?,"First, let me say that I love your videos, Charlotte; they make my day... Yes, even the ones with Mike, lol...

I (32F) have been best friends with **E (28F)** since 2015. We’ve always been really close, but things changed after she started dating her now-husband, **R (37M)**.   
  
For context:

R used to date E’s sister back in high school (yep, awkward). His parents live just a few houses away from hers. He has been divorced before, and his ex even tried to keep him financially supporting her and her child after their divorce(the child is not his, she had fallen pregnant while they dated with another mans child). 

Six months into dating, R proposed… if you can even call it that. It was on Christmas morning in front of his family, at a plain breakfast table, where he basically tossed the ring box across the table and said, *“And?”* Meanwhile his mom shoved her phone in E’s face yelling, *“Say yes already!”* Definitely not the snowy, romantic proposal E had once told me she dreamed of. But she said yes.

Since then, the relationship has been rough. R constantly belittles E in front of others (*“E’s too lazy, I had to clean”* or *“look at the stupid thing she did”*). He overshares about their intimate life, and he’s financially irresponsible — in serious debt, blacklisted, and now relying on money E gives him while pretending to “buy her gifts.” His mom is manipulative and enabling (when I met her, her *actual greeting* was, *“I hope you don’t go into my room and use my dildos.”* I’d known her five seconds).

A few weeks ago, E’s mom called me. She said E was talking about divorce, and she wanted me to “talk some sense into her” and convince her to work things out. Instead, I invited E over for coffee so she could vent.

That’s when she told me R had recently tried to **force himself on her.** She told him no, he ignored her, got rough, and insulted her. She managed to fight him off and fled to her parents’ house — only for her mom to brush it off as her “misunderstanding his advances.”

Afterward, R found texts from another guy on her phone. She admitted she’d been chatting for attention because of how badly R treats her. They argued, and she decided she wanted to end the marriage.

When she told me this, I told her I’d support whatever she decided. My husband asked her directly if she still loved R, and she said no — she’s lost all love and respect for him.

Now, her parents are upset with me because instead of convincing her to stay, I told her I’d back her choice. They think I’m enabling her to throw away her marriage, but from where I’m standing, she’s in a toxic and unsafe situation.

So, **AITA for supporting my best friend’s decision to divorce her husband instead of doing what her parents wanted and pushing her to stay?**",1,1757477327.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False
1nd4f4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1nd4f4a/after_divorce_i_married_his_fake_disabled_brother/,After Divorce I Married His Fake Disabled Brother,"""I accept your terms."" My voice remained steady as I spoke into the phone. ""I'll return as the heiress.""  
  
The line went dead.  
  
I stared at the bedroom that had been my prison for eight long years. A bitter smile touched my lips. Eight years of devotion. Eight years of patience. Eight years of love. All for nothing.  
  
""How dare you wear my mother's dress!""  
  
The shrill voice shattered my thoughts. I turned slowly to face Liam, his small face contorted with rage.  
  
""You're not going to say anything?"" he demanded, tiny hands clenched into fists.  
  
""Your friends are waiting, Liam."" I kept my voice soft. ""You should go enjoy your party.""  
  
""No!"" he screamed.  
  
He grabbed the ceramic pitcher from the table and threw its contents at me. Scalding hot coffee drenched my dress and skin. I cried out in pain.  
  
""Serves you right! You'll never replace my mother! You killed her with your evil heart!"" Liam shouted. ""And now you're wearing her favorite dress!""  
  
A maid rushed into the room. She gasped at the sight of me covered in coffee stains, my skin already reddening from burns.  
  
""I'm so sorry, Miss! Liam escaped from his minders."" The maid grabbed the smirking boy and hurried away.  
  
I retreated to the bathroom. The dress had never belonged to Isabella, my stepsister who died giving birth to Liam. It was mine—a gift from my late mother that Isabella had stolen from me. Just like she stole everything else.  
  
Eight years ago, I was supposed to marry Alexander Russo. We were childhood sweethearts. I believed we were in love. Then he married Isabella. She became pregnant. She lived the life that should have been mine.  
  
Then she died. Everyone called me bad luck. They accused me of killing her out of jealousy.  
  
As Isabella's only sister and Alexander's former fiancée, I was sent to care for Liam. My stepmother told me to treat him like my own son.  
  
For eight years, I did exactly that. I loved Liam as my own. I cared for Alexander too. But I was foolish. Alexander never loved me.  
  
They both treated me like garbage. They made sure I knew my place—nothing but a live-in nanny. A servant.  
  
Liam never respected me. He constantly found ways to hurt me. But today, on his eighth birthday, I decided enough was enough.  
  
If this had happened three years ago, I would have begged for his forgiveness. Not anymore.  
  
""The party has started."" Alexander's voice came from the doorway. ""Where are you, Rachel?""  
  
I emerged from the bathroom just as he entered. He sighed at the sight of my stained dress.  
  
""I heard what Liam did. Don't take it personally. He's just a child who loves you,"" Alexander said.  
  
I laughed bitterly. ""That boy doesn't know the first thing about loving me.""  
  
""Don't say that. He's a good kid."" Alexander frowned.  
  
I moved away from him and reached for the healing balm on the nightstand. My skin burned where the coffee had scalded it. The ointment would work miracles overnight.  
  
""Let me help you."" Alexander took the balm from my hands before I could protest.  
  
His fingers gently massaged the ointment into my burned skin. Years ago, his touch would have made me weak. Now it made my skin crawl.  
  
""Be patient with him,"" he whispered, his breath warm against my neck.  
  
I pulled away. ""I need to tell you something.""  
  
""Can't it wait? Liam's birthday celebration has begun.""  
  
""No, it can't wait."" I met his gaze directly. ""Eight years is enough. I'm leaving.""Chapter 2  
  
""What are you talking about?"" Alexander's voice boomed.  
  
I saw his expression darken with rage.  
  
The air grew thick with tension.  
  
But I refused to back down.  
  
""It's been eight years, Alexander. I want out,"" I stated clearly.  
  
He glared at me. ""What's wrong with you? Why cause trouble now? I told you Liam is just a kid. Don't take his actions personally. It's his birthday today. Come with me. I'll deal with him later.""  
  
Alexander reached for my hand, pulling me toward the door.  
  
I snatched my hand back. ""You promised I could leave when he turned eight. So why am I the one causing trouble?"" I challenged.  
  
Before he could respond, an angry voice cut through the air.  
  
""Rachel, you have no shame! Always making everything about you, even on my grandson's special day!""  
  
I recognized that voice instantly.  
  
Victoria. My stepmother. Liam's grandmother.  
  
She was the one who made the deal with Alexander. Eight years, then freedom.  
  
So why were they acting like this now?  
  
""I'm not making it about me, Victoria. You said I could leave after eight years,"" I reminded her.  
  
She laughed mockingly. ""Did you have to bring this up today?""  
  
""It's fine. I'm sure Rachel didn't mean any harm,"" Alexander interrupted.  
  
In the past, his defense would have made me blush.  
  
Now I knew better. It was just another pathetic attempt to keep me trapped.  
  
""Come on, let's join the party,"" Alexander said to me.  
  
I stayed silent, letting him lead me to the ongoing celebration.  
  
Liam and his friends were playing happily.  
  
His smile vanished when he saw me.  
  
""Look, Liam, your mom's here,"" someone said.  
  
He scoffed loudly. ""She's not my mother!""  
  
I stood nearby while Alexander sighed and pulled Liam close.  
  
""We don't say things like that. Rachel is your mother. She's taken good care of you,"" Alexander stated firmly.  
  
Liam's face twisted with anger. ""No! She can never be my mother. Everyone, this woman killed my real mom!""  
  
Whispers spread through the party hall.  
  
All eyes turned to me.  
  
""She's the boy's aunt.""  
  
""Why doesn't the boy like her?""  
  
""Clearly she's not treating him well.""  
  
""Apologize to her right now,"" Alexander demanded.  
  
I stopped him. ""It's fine. It doesn't matter.""  
  
I walked away calmly.  
  
In the past, Liam's words would have shattered me.  
  
But I've accepted the truth.  
  
No matter what I do, Alexander's heart will always belong to Isabella.  
  
Liam will always blame me for taking his mother's place.  
  
""Why did you have to make a scene today?""  
  
Victoria's sharp voice cut through my thoughts.  
  
She stepped into view, glaring.  
  
""What do you want, Victoria? I've played my part for eight years. I'm done,"" I said.  
  
""You should care for Liam like your own son. Tolerate his behavior. Look after him. If my daughter were alive, he'd be treated much better,"" she snapped.  
  
I shrugged, exhausted. ""Too bad your daughter isn't here.""  
  
Victoria raised her hand to strike me.  
  
I caught her wrist. ""Don't try it. I'm not in the mood. Eight years ago you forced me to come here and take care of them. The contract is over. Liam is eight. I have every right to leave.""  
  
She yanked her hand back, rubbing her sore wrist.  
  
She glared at me. ""Do what you want, Rachel. This is why no one will ever love you. Even your father can't stand you!"" she hissed before storming off.  
  
A bitter smile touched my lips.  
  
Eight years since I last saw my father.  
  
Since his favorite daughter died and he sent me away.  
  
He never cared to visit.  
  
""I'm sorry. I got you a gift.""  
  
A small voice spoke behind me.  
  
I turned to see Liam standing there with an innocent smile.  
  
He held a wrapped gift box.  
  
I smiled. ""Aww, you shouldn't have.""  
  
He giggled. ""I wanted to. Please, open it.""  
  
I took the box and opened it.  
  
A foul smell hit my nose.  
  
Inside was the lifeless body of my cat, Oliver, killed with an arrow.  
  
""That will be you soon if you don't leave me and my father alone,"" Liam giggled.Chapter 3I stared in horror at the only pet I’d been permitted to bring to the estate.  
  
My hands trembled as I looked at the arrow piercing Oliver’s small body.  
  
I had raised Liam with the same tenderness.  
  
Yet this was how he repaid me.  
  
“Stay out of my way,” Liam snapped, his voice cold.  
  
“And don’t you dare upset my father because of this.”  
  
He stormed off without a backward glance.  
  
I remained frozen, my gaze locked on the lifeless form of my cat.  
  
The irony was cruel.  
  
I had taught Liam how to handle a bow.  
  
I had taught him so much.  
  
Now he turned every lesson against me.  
  
Cradling the small box, I let a tear escape.  
  
Oliver had been my silent companion through countless lonely nights.  
  
“Rachel, what are you doing out here in the cold?” Alexander’s voice cut through the evening air.  
  
He stepped out into the garden, concern etching his features.  
  
“You’ll catch a chill.”  
  
He moved behind me, draping his jacket over my shoulders.  
  
I shook it off immediately.  
  
His eyes fell to the box in my arms, and his expression tightened with distaste.  
  
“Your son came to apologize,” I said flatly.  
  
Alexander’s frown deepened.  
  
“He’s your son too, Rachel.”  
  
I let out a bitter laugh.  
  
“He despises me, Alexander.  
  
He killed my cat.”  
  
“Come inside,” he urged, his tone softening.  
  
“We’ll discuss this with Liam in the morning.  
  
You can bury the cat tomorrow.  
  
It was just a boy’s thoughtless prank.”  
  
I pulled away, clutching the box tighter.  
  
“I’m not leaving him outside for the animals.”  
  
Though he complained about my stubbornness, Alexander followed me into the garden.  
  
He stood silently as I dug a small grave under the old oak tree.  
  
When it was done, I brushed the dirt from my hands and turned toward the house.  
  
The party had ended.  
  
The guests were gone.  
  
The wind picked up, biting through my thin dress.  
  
I sneezed just as Alexander reached for me.  
  
He guided me inside and up to my room.  
  
He sat me on his lap, but I stiffened, pulling away.  
  
“What do you want, Alexander?” I demanded.  
  
He sighed.  
  
“I’ll get you another cat, Rachel.  
  
A dozen if you wish.”  
  
“I want to leave.  
  
Tomorrow.”  
  
Alexander’s body went rigid.  
  
“Liam is just a child.  
  
I trust no one else with him.  
  
Where would you even go?  
  
You have no one.”  
  
“I’ll manage,” I said, my voice hollow.  
  
“I don’t belong here.  
  
You refused to marry me after eight years, Alexander.”  
  
“You know why I can’t take another wife now,” he replied, frustration creeping into his tone.  
  
“I’m not asking you to.  
  
I don’t want to marry you.  
  
I just want to go.”  
  
“Then have my child,” he said suddenly, his eyes intent.  
  
“A child would secure your position.  
  
No one would dare disrespect you then.  
  
And Liam would have a sibling.”  
  
A sad smile touched my lips.  
  
I had sacrificed everything for this family—my pride, my youth, my self-respect.  
  
And still, he wanted me to bear an illegitimate child.  
  
All to keep me under his roof, all to control me.  
  
“I’ve already instructed the maid on Liam’s routine.  
  
He’s homeschooled—hire better tutors or send him to school.  
  
He doesn’t need me.”  
  
Alexander leaned in and kissed me.  
  
“Sleep on it.  
  
We’ll talk in the morning.”  
  
But I didn’t sleep.  
  
I packed my bags through the night, Oliver’s still face haunting me.  
  
Morning arrived too soon.  
  
After a quick shower, I dragged my suitcases downstairs.  
  
This was it.  
  
I was finally leaving.  
  
But peace was not in the cards for me.  
  
A slow, mocking clap echoed across the courtyard.  
  
Sophia leaned against a pillar, a smirk playing on her lips.  
  
“Well, well.  
  
Finally developed some self-respect, have you?”  
  
I ignored her, continuing toward the gate.  
  
She stepped into my path, blocking my exit.  
  
“Eight years, Rachel.  
  
Eight years you spent waiting for a man who never wanted you.  
  
And now you’re walking away?”  
  
She chuckled.  
  
“Took you long enough to understand.  
  
Alexander and Liam will never love you.  
  
You were always just the worthless mistress.”  
  
I met her gaze, my face expressionless.  
  
“Enjoy your victory then.  
  
Do as you please.  
  
None of this matters to me anymore.”  
  
Her smirk widened.  
  
“Oh, I will.  
  
Soon I’ll be moving in.  
  
I’ll take everything that was never yours.”  
  
Before I could reply, the front doors flew open.  
  
Alexander stepped out, Liam close behind.  
  
In an instant, Sophia’s demeanor shattered.  
  
She fell to her knees, clutching the hem of my dress with theatrical desperation.  
  
“Rachel, please don’t go!” she sobbed, her voice trembling.  
  
“Liam needs you!  
  
How can you abandon him after all these years?”  
  
I stared down at her, numb.  
  
“He loves you, he really does!” she cried, tears streaming down her face.  
  
“He’s just a boy!  
  
Please, I beg you—don’t leave him!”  
  
Alexander let out an impatient sigh.  
  
“Stop this nonsense, Sophia.  
  
You’re making a scene.”  
  
His eyes were cold as they settled on me.  
  
“I said I’d replace the cat.  
  
Don’t upset Sophia over something so trivial.”  
  
I clenched my fists, but before I could speak, Liam rushed to Sophia’s side.  
  
He helped her up, his small hands wiping her fake tears.  
  
Then he turned to me, his eyes burning with hatred.  
  
“You killed my mother with your wickedness,” he spat.  
  
“And now you’re trying to hurt Sophia too?”  
  
His voice shook with anger.  
  
He looked back at Sophia, his expression softening.  
  
“Don’t cry.  
  
Let her go.  
  
I don’t want her here.  
  
I don’t need her.”  
  
He lifted his chin, his words sharp as blades.  
  
“I want you to be my mother.  
  
You should marry my father.”  
  
Then his eyes returned to me, filled with pure scorn.  
  
“You have an evil heart.  
  
That’s why my father could never love you.”  
  
A cruel smile touched his lips.  
  
“I’m glad you’re leaving.”  
  
I swallowed the pain thickening in my throat.  
  
I took one last look at the boy I had raised, the child I had loved as my own.  
  
“After eight years,” I said quietly, “if this is what you believe of me, then there’s no reason left to stay.”  
  
Without another word, I turned and walked toward the gate.  
  
Just as I reached it, I heard the familiar sound of a crossbow being drawn.  
  
An arrow whizzed past, missing my head by inches.Chapter 4Isabella’s POV  
  
“Don’t think pretending to be pitiful will make me keep you as my stepmother!”  
  
“If you have the guts to leave, never come back!”  
  
The sharp arrow flew straight toward me, loaded with the boy’s bitter rage.  
  
I barely moved in time, but it still sliced deep into my shoulder.  
  
A raw cry tore from my throat.  
  
Alexander was at my side instantly, holding me as I clenched my teeth against the pain.  
  
“I’m so sorry, Isabella,” he cried out.  
  
Just then, Sophia screamed, and Liam shouted too.  
  
“Papa, come quick! Aunt Sophia twisted her ankle running to help that witch!” Liam yelled.  
  
Alexander looked torn, his eyes darting between my bleeding shoulder and Sophia’s dramatic fall.  
  
He released me with a heavy sigh.  
  
“It’s a clean wound, Isabella. Go to the hospital—I’ll meet you there. Sophia can’t walk; I have to take her,” he said.  
  
I didn’t let my disappointment show.  
  
I stayed on the ground, watching him walk away from me—again.  
  
He carried Sophia in his arms, bridal style.  
  
She shot me a smug look as they got into the car and drove off with Liam.  
  
There I was, left alone on the cold floor, bleeding from a wound given by the child I had raised, trained, and taught to shoot.  
  
Life could be so cruel.  
  
I struggled to stand when I heard footsteps behind me.  
  
“You wretched girl! Why are you still here? Didn’t you tell the whole city you were leaving?”  
  
I knew that voice. It was Eleanor, Alexander’s mother. She had always despised me.  
  
I forced myself up and turned to face her.  
  
She gasped when she saw my injury and the blood staining my clothes.  
  
“Trying to frame my son? If you want to die, do it somewhere else!” she spat.  
  
“I was leaving when your grandson shot me,” I replied coldly.  
  
She laughed mockingly. “Hurt yourself and now blaming a child? You’re just acting pitiful so Alexander pities you. You lost your place here the moment you decided to go.”  
  
“I want nothing from you or your family, Eleanor. Your grandson did this!” I snapped.  
  
She smirked. “Then you won’t mind getting out.”  
  
Before I could respond, she snatched my luggage and threw it outside the gate.  
  
“Get out!” she hissed, shoving me out too. “Go die somewhere else. Leave my son alone.”  
  
I stumbled and fell, clutching my bleeding shoulder.  
  
“You’ll regret this,” I vowed, fury burning in my chest.  
  
I gathered my boxes just as my Uber pulled up.  
  
“Sorry I’m late, Miss,” the driver said.  
  
“It’s fine,” I muttered, sliding into the back seat.  
  
He eyed my shoulder. “Still heading to the airport?”  
  
I shook my head. “Take me to the hospital first.”  
  
I leaned back and closed my eyes, exhaustion taking over.  
  
I woke to the steady beeping of an EKG machine.  
  
I was in a hospital room. My arm throbbed with pain when I tried to sit up.  
  
My boxes were stacked neatly beside the bed.  
  
The door opened, and a doctor walked in.  
  
“Miss Isabella, how are you feeling?” he asked.  
  
I groaned. “What happened? Last thing I remember, I was in a cab.”  
  
The doctor nodded. “You passed out before arriving. The Uber driver brought you in.”  
  
I checked my phone. I’d missed my flight.  
  
A new text waited. I replied quickly.  
  
Something came up. Reschedule my flight ASAP.  
  
“Miss Isabella?” The doctor pulled my attention back.  
  
I lifted a brow. “Yes?”  
  
“You lost a lot of blood, but you’ve been treated. You’ll be discharged soon,” he explained.  
  
I nodded. “Thank you.”  
  
He smiled and left. I stood and reached for my boxes.  
  
Not a single call or message from Alexander.  
  
His son shot me, and he couldn’t even check if I was alive.  
  
The door swung open.  
  
Sophia walked in, looking pleased with herself.  
  
I rolled my eyes.  
  
“What do you want? I thought you twisted your ankle,” I said flatly.  
  
She giggled. “Oh, that? I just wanted to see who Alexander would choose. And he picked me! Exciting, isn’t it?”  
  
I scoffed. “Have your fun, Sophia. I’m leaving.”  
  
She stepped in front of me, a smug smile on her lips.  
  
“There’s something you should know,” she said, voice dripping with pride. “I’m pregnant. With Alexander’s baby.”  
  
The air left my lungs.  
  
My heart shattered, but I refused to let it show.  
  
I wouldn’t give her the satisfaction.  
  
Eight years.  
  
Eight years by his side, and I was never more than a shadow.  
  
He always made me take birth control right after he was done with me.  
  
He always wanted another child.  
  
Just not with me.Chapter 5  
  
""Goodbye, Sophia,"" I told her.  
  
She stood firmly in my path, refusing to let me pass.  
  
My patience was wearing thin. My phone had just buzzed with a flight update—rescheduled, and I couldn't miss it this time.  
  
All I wanted was to get away from these people. Why was she purposely provoking me?  
  
""What do you want?"" I demanded.  
  
Sophia gave a sly smile. ""I want to see you break down.""  
  
I let out a harsh laugh. ""Not going to happen.""  
  
As I tried to move past her with my box, she threw a few dollar bills at my feet.  
  
""For your taxi fare,"" she sneered.  
  
Something in me snapped. Before I could stop myself, my hand flew out and struck her across the face.  
  
""How dare you?"" I seethed.  
  
Sophia screamed loudly, just as Alexander and Liam rushed into the room.  
  
""What did you do, Isabella?"" Alexander shouted, seeing Sophia’s reddened cheek.  
  
I glared back. ""What did I do? You come running when she screams. Where were you when your son shot me? Where were you when I was bleeding out?""  
  
""Evil woman!"" Liam cried out. ""She hurt Sophia!""  
  
""It's not her fault, Liam,"" Sophia whimpered. ""I came to ask her to stay. I offered her money, and she hit me.""  
  
""Stop the act, Sophia. Stop playing the victim!"" I snapped.  
  
""No, you stop, Isabella!"" Alexander shot back. ""I’ve been too easy on you. Apologize to Sophia, and I might take you back.""  
  
I stared at him, then burst into laughter. ""Even if you were the last man alive, Alexander, I would never be with you.""  
  
""What is that supposed to mean? How dare you speak to me like that?"" he roared.  
  
""Eight years, and you never wanted a child. Then I find out on the same day your son shoots me that Sophia is pregnant with your baby,"" I stated coldly.  
  
Alexander shot a quick, questioning look at Sophia, as if asking why she had told me.  
  
""We can discuss that later. Just come home. We can work this out,"" he said, softening his tone.  
  
""In your dreams,"" I retorted.  
  
I turned and walked away, ignoring his demands for me to stop.  
  
A short while later, I arrived at the airport just in time for my flight.  
  
As I was checking in and about to switch off my phone, it rang.  
  
It was Alexander. Reluctantly, I answered.  
  
""What do you want?"" I snapped.  
  
""I know you’re upset about Sophia’s pregnancy. Come home. Give me a child, and I’ll add your name to my will. You and your child will want for nothing,"" he said.  
  
""Go to hell, Alexander,"" I replied coldly.  
  
I hung up and blocked his number without another word.  
  
The flight was long. I slept through most of it, relieved when the plane finally landed.  
  
I stepped into the arrivals hall with my boxes and noticed a well-dressed man in a tuxedo holding a sign that read: Isabella Sterling.  
  
I approached him, and he recognized me immediately.  
  
""Miss Sterling, I’m Christopher. Your personal guard,"" he introduced himself.  
  
""Thank you,"" I said with a nod.  
  
He took my luggage, loaded it into the car, and opened the back door for me.  
  
I sank into the plush leather seat of the SUV, relaxing as we drove off. Soon, we arrived at a grand mansion.  
  
This was the home of my grandparents, Benjamin and Charlotte Sterling.  
  
Their company, Sterling Enterprises, was the largest in New York, and I was their only heir.  
  
Three years ago, they reached out and revealed they were my mother’s parents. My mother was supposed to marry someone else, but she eloped with my father for love and left her family behind.  
  
Unbeknownst to me, when my mother was dying of cancer, she had contacted them and told them about me.  
  
When they first asked me to take over, I was still deeply in love with Alexander and believed I could win his heart. I had refused their offer.  
  
""Isabella! Welcome home,"" my grandmother’s voice called out.  
  
She and my grandfather came outside and wrapped me in a warm embrace.  
  
""We’re so happy you’re here,"" they said.  
  
I smiled. ""Thank you for having me.""  
  
My grandmother waved a hand. ""Nonsense, Isabella. All of this is yours.""  
  
My grandfather nodded. ""Yes, Isabella. You are now the heiress of Sterling Enterprises.""  
  
I smiled.  
  
Because now it was time for payback.Chapter 6  
  
Rachel’s Pov  
  
The moment I entered the magnificent Sterling mansion, the air filled with the rich aroma of fresh roses and polished mahogany.

I used WordPress, my email, and Facebook and that’s literally it. Before I left the shop, I had the option to update Windows and shut down or just shut down. I opted for just shut down since I needed to get home and figured I could do it later. It shut down no problem. I get home, and I start up my laptop again. At first everything seems normal, everything booting up as usual all my programs starting as usual. 

Then it randomly flashes a screen that says “Your device ran into a problem and needs to restart.” At the bottom it says “Stop code: SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (0x38),” and below that it says “What failed: win32kbase.sys”
This screen only lasts a second or two before going black and showing the ASUS restarting screen. It restarts, turns back on looking normal with my wallpaper and everything. I log in, my programs start as usual, then boom the same restart screens. Then again, then again, then a blue screen telling me to put in a BitLocker key. 

The only BitLocker Keys I have on my Microsoft account are from 2023. I try using the recovery code they told me to use, but the button to confirm it is greyed out and won’t let me click it or press enter or anything. So then I click “Skip this drive” and it takes me to a page suggesting I try repairing the laptop. I click that option, but it only lasts a second on the “repairing” screen before telling me it was unable to do the Automatic Repair. 

So then I go to Advanced Options>Troubleshooting>Reset This PC>Keep My Files. Instant screen saying they can’t. So instead I try “Remove Everything.” Same deal, instant screen that says “There was a problem resetting your PC.” 

So then I try the advanced options and try to uninstall updates just in case something funky happened with an attempted Windows update. No luck. I try Startup Repair and it shows “Diagnosing issue” for a second before saying it was unable to repair the PC. So I try “Reset Startup Settings” and enter my Bitlocker Key to grant me access to the settings, none of which I understand the consequences of and my laptop shuts off before I have the chance to research any of it.

I turned back on my laptop, and my wallpaper is back again and everything seems normal for one second before it crashes and restarts AGAIN. This is starting to look like a never ending cycle.

I put in my Bitlocker Key again, it sits on the diagnosing screen for a bit before saying my laptop couldn’t connect to the network and to keep my device on since they’re gonna try again in another half hour. There is also an option to do more recovery options but I doubt any of them will work. 

Please, for the love of all that is holy, does anyone out there know what this is or how to fix it? I have not been on any shady websites, I haven’t done anything out of the ordinary, I haven’t ever seen an issue like this in my laptop and I don’t know why it would be happening so suddenly and why my laptop is literally incapable of diagnosing or resolving any of the problems. Do I just need to take my laptop to my computer place and ask them to do a clean install of Windows or something?",1,1757477130.0,techsupport,2,1.0,False

Two voices. Mira's laugh rang out, loud and familiar. Mira, his ex, the owner of the gym, the one he begged me never to approach her.

I paused just outside the door.

""You never answered me. What's the deal with that chubby girl? The one who follows you around like a stray?""

I froze.

I wasn't breathing. I wasn't alive.

Rider chuckled—chuckled. ""She's no one, Mira. Just a client. A girl who shows up every time I smile at her. Honestly? She seems desperate. It's like... she thinks being pitiful is cute.""

""She always looks like she's about to cry,"" Mira scoffed. ""Like she's trying to puppy-dog-eye her way into your bed.""

""She's a charity case,"" he said, voice low but not low enough.

Each word peeled another layer off my skin. My breath turned jagged, my heart a frantic animal in my chest.

And maybe, just maybe, I was finally ready to be wanted.

Oh, How wrong was I. He will only be another life lesson.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I never thought I would love the gym.

Yet, here I am—one year in, stronger, more confident, and finally seeing a reflection I don't shy away from. The girl who once wore oversized sweaters to disappear now wears fitted leggings and tank tops without flinching. The girl who used to lower her gaze in mirrors now meets her own eyes head-on, silently acknowledging how far she has come.

And it's all because of him.

Rider.

My coach. My friend. My secret.

It started with simple encouragement—a warm smile after a tough set, the way he always seemed to notice when I needed a push. He was effortless, charming without trying, and I had fallen—hard.

There was a time, early in our friendship, when he caught me struggling with a deadlift.

""You're thinking too much, December. The weight doesn't control you. You control it.""

I had rolled my eyes. ""Sounds like a terrible motivational poster.""

""Maybe,"" he'd grinned, ""but I believe it.""

And somehow, I started believing it too—not just about the weights but about myself.

Then one night, I had stayed late at the gym. The world outside was dark and quiet. It had just been the two of us—like it so often was. I had been sitting on one of the benches, catching my breath, when he sat beside me.

""I've been thinking about something.""

I turned to him, surprised by the softness in his voice. ""Yeah?""

Rider hesitated, rubbing the back of his neck, then exhaled. ""I like you, December. And not just in a 'you're my client' way. In a 'let me take you out' kind of way.""

My heart nearly exploded.

""Wait—what?""

He laughed. ""is that a good what, a happy what, or what-the-he1l What?""

""No,"" I rushed out, warmth rushing to my cheeks. ""it is a ...wow what""

""Really? I thought I couldn't have been more obvious"" he teased.

""Well you seemed nice to everyone,"" I lied.

""There is nice professional and nice flirty, and I was constantly flirting with you but yeah I think I needed to be straightforward. I really like you Dec. Seeing you and talking to you are the highlight of my day.""

I had been floating. I wanted to say yes a million times over. And then he added, ""But... it has to be a secret. For now."" Just like that, the moment cracked.

""A secret?""

""I just started here, Dec. It wouldn't look great if I immediately started dating a client. Give me time. It's temporary, I promise.""

I had been disappointed, but when he took my hands, when he looked at me with those steady, unwavering eyes and said, ""I just want you, December,"" I had believed him.

So, I agreed.

And for eight months, he had made me feel like the only woman in the world.

Like every Tuesday, I met my closest friends for brunch at our favorite café. The place smelled of cinnamon and freshly brewed coffee, a cozy warmth against the chill of late autumn outside. May, October, and June were already there, the table cluttered with pastries and half-empty mugs.

""So, Dec,"" May said, stirring her latte with a knowing smirk. ""It's been a year since you started working out, right?""

""Yeah,"" I nodded, cutting into my avocado toast.

""And you look incredible,"" June added, eyeing me with approval. ""Seriously, you're glowing.""

I laughed, tucking a loose strand of auburn hair behind my ear. ""I just feel... better. Stronger.""

""And more confident,"" October noted. ""You've been dressing differently too. Fitted tops, skirts. You're showing off, girl.""

I felt my cheeks warm. ""I guess I just finally feel comfortable in my own skin.""

""But the real question is,"" May leaned in conspiratorially, ""has someone noticed?""

I nearly choked on my coffee.

June's eyes widened. ""Wait. Has someone noticed?""

October narrowed her eyes. ""You have that look. You're totally seeing someone, aren't you?""

I forced a casual shrug. ""I'm... just focusing on myself right now.""

""Uh-huh,"" May rolled her eyes. ""You suck at lying, you know that?""

""Leave her alone,"" June laughed. ""If there's a guy, she'll tell us when she's ready.""

I offered her a grateful smile, but guilt gnawed at me. I wished I could tell them—about Rider, about the stolen moments, about how he made me feel like the most beautiful woman in the world.

But secrets had become part of our love story.

And for now, I had to keep it that way.

By the time I arrived at River Heights Elementary, the cool morning air had faded into a crisp, sunny afternoon. Teaching had always been my passion, but since my confidence had grown, I noticed a change in how I carried myself in the classroom.

My students adored me—especially the way I made lessons fun.

During science class, one of my third graders, Emily, tugged on my sleeve.

""Ms. December, do you have a boyfriend?""

I blinked, startled. ""What?""

""Miss Parker does,"" Emily declared. ""I heard her talking about him. And you're really pretty, so you should have one too.""

I chuckled, smoothing down Emily's braids. ""Well, thank you, sweetheart. But not having a boyfriend doesn't mean someone isn't happy, okay?""

Emily thought about it. ""But do you have one?""

I hesitated before laughing. ""Alright, back to science. Who can tell me why leaves change color?""

As the class erupted into answers, I shook my head, amusement dancing in my eyes.

If only Emily knew.

After a long day at work, I let out a breath as I unlocked my apartment door, expecting the usual quiet. But the moment I stepped inside, the scent of garlic and rosemary filled the air.

My heart skipped.

There he was—Rider—standing at my stove, his broad back to me, stirring something in a pan. A soft candle flickered on the dining table, next to two plates already set out.

He turned, smiling that easy, breathtaking smile.

""Happy eight months, December.""

I melted.

He walked toward me, k1ssed me softly, and just like that, all my nerves disappeared.

And maybe it was the warmth in the room, the candlelight flickering on the table, or just the simple fact that I knew this was love—real, undeniable love—but I looked at him and said it.

""I love you.""

He stilled.

For a heartbeat, I thought maybe he hadn't heard me. Then, slowly, he smiled.

And k1ssed my forehead.

""You're adorable.""

My stomach dropped.

My breath caught in my throat.

That was not what I had expected.

Not I love you too. Not even a k1ss. Just... adorable.

My heart pounded as he turned back to the stove, humming like nothing had happened, while I stood there—shocked, hurt, and so confused.

Because for the first time in eight months, I wasn't sure if he really meant it when he said he wanted me.

And for the first time in months, I had a terrible feeling this wasn't going to end well.

Dinner should have felt warm. Familiar. Comfortable.

But it didn't.

Rider sat across from me, animated and bright-eyed as he talked about his new clients at the gym. A guy training for his first triathlon. A woman who just had her second baby and was trying to get her strength back. He smiled when he spoke about them, his hands moving with excitement. He even mentioned something funny his mom texted earlier in the day—something about his dad pretending to forget their anniversary, like it was a family tradition.

He laughed. I smiled.

He asked about my day, my students, if I'd seen any of ""the girls"" lately—May, June, October. I answered him, politely, carefully.

But I felt far away.

Not once did he mention what I said last night. Not one word about it.

I kept wondering if he heard me at all. Or if he just filed it away in some box labeled ""Too Soon"" or ""Not Worth Noticing.""

And if he did notice the quiet in my voice, or the way my smile never quite reached my eyes... he didn't let on.

After we ate, I cleaned up while he scrolled through his phone, occasionally reading me things he thought were funny. I nodded along. I laughed where I was supposed to. But inside?

I was just... tired.

When it was time for bed, I retreated into the bathroom and closed the door like it was armor. I took my time with my skincare routine, methodically patting creams and serums into my skin—layer after layer, as if they could fix what was unraveling beneath the surface.

I stared into the mirror. My reflection looked calm, composed. But my eyes gave me away.

I had told him I loved him. And he had k1ssed my forehead. Said I was ""adorable."" Like a puppy. Or a child. Not a woman. Not his woman. It was the first time in my entire life I'd ever said ""I love you"" to a man. And I'd meant it with every trembling, terrified part of me. No man had ever said those words to me. Not even my father. My mom had. So many times. But somehow, even all of hers together didn't feel like enough to fill this ache.

When I finally walked back into the bedroom, he was already under the covers, shirtless, hair tousled like he belonged in some kind of cologne ad. He looked over and smiled that lazy, beautiful smile.

""I've missed sleeping next to you,"" he said. I forced a nod. ""I'm really tired.""

""That's okay, come here"" he said easily.

He pulled me into his arms, and I let him. His warmth wrapped around me, and for a second I wished it could sink into my bones and make me feel whole again. But it didn't. He whispered, ""Sweet dreams."" And just like that, he fell asleep. I stayed very still.

Very quiet.

And I cried.

Not loud, not broken—just silent, steady tears that soaked into his arm and the pillow, invisible to him but loud enough in my own chest to feel like thunder.

I imagined myself beautiful. Not just pretty. Not ""adorable."" But undeniable. A woman who could be loved fully and fearlessly. I imagined a version of myself who didn't have to hide how badly she wanted to be chosen. And then I lay there in the dark beside a man I loved. A man who maybe didn't love me back. And I told myself over and over: ""Don't wake him. Don't let him see you like this. Just hold on a little longer.""

I woke up with swollen eyes. The kind that told the truth before I could open my mouth. Rider was still asleep, the room bathed in that soft Wednesday morning glow we used to love. His day off. My late start. We were supposed to work out together, maybe grab breakfast after—our little tradition.

But today? I couldn't pretend. Not after last night. Not after the hour I spent curled next to him, silently crying into his chest, while he dreamt peacefully beside me. I slipped out of bed, grateful—so grateful—that he was a heavy sleeper. The shower helped clear my head but not the ache in my chest. When I got out and caught my reflection, I stopped. My eyes were puffy and red-rimmed, cheeks dull, lips pressed in tight. And then I saw everything else.

The soft belly that refused to flatten, the stretch in my arms no matter how many sets I lifted, the skin around my neck that I swore looked older every morning.

No wonder I was still a secret.

I got dressed quickly, grabbed my bag, and left without a sound.

May's art studio was nestled in the corner of a converted warehouse, one of those cozy creative spaces that always smelled like acrylic paint and lavender candles. She practically lived there. It wasn't even 8 a.m., but I knew she'd be there—probably barefoot, wild-haired, with a paintbrush behind her ear.

Sure enough, she answered the door in paint-splattered pajamas, blinking like she forgot what time of day it was.

""Is it Thursday?"" she mumbled.

""Wednesday.""

""d@mn. Come in.""

I stepped inside, and the familiar chaos of May's world wrapped around me like a hug. Stretched canvases leaned against every wall. Half-finished paintings and open jars of paint cluttered every surface. Music hummed low from a speaker in the corner, something French and soft. We didn't say anything at first. She just handed me a chipped black mug filled with bitter coffee and sat cross-legged on the floor, working on a portrait of a sleeping cat.

""You okay?"" she asked eventually. Not like a demand. More like a nudge.

I stared into my mug, fingers wrapped tight around the warmth.

""Do you think... do you think I'll ever be attractive enough to be loved by a man?""

She didn't gasp or freeze. She just sighed.

""I knew something was going on,"" she said gently. ""I've been waiting for you to talk. I respect that you didn't want to. But if it's about a guy..."" She looked up at me, paint streaked across her cheek. ""He's a d@mn fool.""

I swallowed hard.

""No. No one called me ugly. He just... he doesn't love me back.""

I felt the tears building again. ""Please don't ask me to explain more.""

She took another breath, softer this time.

""Okay. So maybe he doesn't love you. Not yet. Maybe not ever. But what makes you think that has anything to do with your looks?""

I didn't answer.

""I wish you could see yourself the way I see you,"" she whispered.

And then she smiled, eyes lighting up like only May's could.

""Actually... you can. I'm going to paint you. Like one of those French models.""

I blinked. ""Wait, what?""

""I'm serious. I want to paint you. I want you to see the softness in your collarbone, the curve of your shoulders, the way your eyes hold entire galaxies when you're not trying to hide.""

""...You've lost your mind if you think I'm going to pose n-de for you.""

She laughed, full and unbothered.

""Who said anything about n-de? I meant clothed. Mostly."" She winked. ""Unless you want to go full 'Titanic,' in which case, I'll get my charcoal pencils."" Despite myself, I laughed too. A real laugh—sharp and sudden and slightly watery. Maybe I wasn't ready to be loved. But maybe I was ready to be seen.

And May?

She saw me more clearly than I saw myself.

Is it really worth the fight?

This isn't about me, but about my SIL. I'm ND, so I'm sorry if I speak about a sensitive subject impolitely. I try my best not to offend anyone. I also don't have children, and I'm 19, so I probably don't know what I'm talking about. But please if anyone can help us. English is not my native language, I'm sorry.

My SIL (Julia) gave birth 2 months + 3 days ago to a little (2.85 kg) baby girl Amanda. We live in Europe in a country that's pushing for breastfeeding, no matter what. So Julia was very keen on breastfeeding. The baby lost a lot of weight in the first week (I don't remember how much exactly) and has been seen by multiple doctors since then. 

In her first month of life, the baby gained weight up to 3.2 kg. My mum has asked Julia multiple times to give the baby formula because the baby was constantly crying and had hunger cues. My mum breastfed all of us (5 children), and she's very supportive of breastfeeding. She was just very worried about little Amanda. But Julia kept refusing, saying that only her milk counts and she won't be poisoning her daughter with formula.

On her monthly checkup, the doctors said that Amanda is starving and she needs to eat. And so my SIL started going to multiple lactation consultants... They told her to pump around the clock, to top up the feedings with pumped milk, etc. But she refused to give Amanda a bottle because she said that if she introduced the bottle, then Amanda would never latch again.

So she started feeding her like 20 ml of milk after each feed with a kind of feeding tube she put in Amanda's mouth (I don't know what to call it).

Amanda didn't gain any weight for another one and a half weeks, even though she was nursing every three hours around the clock (each feed 50 minutes) + top-ups. Julia asked her mum friends for milk donations, and she started using that milk in the same manner for top-ups because she was able to pump only 50 ml per day. That's when Amanda gained a tiny bit of weight (3.45 kg)

Finally, one and a half weeks ago, another lactation consultant told her that she needs to top up each feed with 80-90 ml of pumped milk, and she started doing it. And Amanda finally calmed down and started gaining weight (she's now 3.79 kg as of today).

They also had her checked for tongue tie, and she didn't really have one, but just a tiny bit of slightly thickened frenulum. They had solved the same day (one week ago).

Today, my SIL visited a lactation consultant, and she told Julia that now she can give Amanda less milk as a top-up since the baby is gaining weight, and they want to check if the smaller amount of milk for one week will still make Amanda gain some weight. My mum is terrified of this idea because she doesn't want to see Amanda starving again, especially now that she has finally started looking pink instead of grey.

My brother doesn't really care because he follows whatever Julia is saying...

The lactation consultant also did a weight feed (but only 20 minutes because they had other patients), and in those 20 minutes, Amanda transferred 25 ml of milk from the breast.

We don't know what to do. We know that breastfeeding is important for babies and mothers. We admire all the women who do this. But this became total craziness. Julia is constantly talking about nursing and pumping, nursing and pumping, there's nothing that matters to her more than breastfeeding. We told her multiple times that she's a wonderful mum and she should relax with this, and de-stress, and sometimes other options might be better for both the mum and the baby. But she won't listen.

She's power pumping once a day, taking supplements, pumping regularly 8 times per day, and she's only leaving the house for a visit to a doctor's or lactation consultant. Amanda doesn't even go outside for a walk in the stroller... The only time Julia is taking her out is when they're driving to an appointment.

She's managing now to pump around 100 ml per day, and the lactation consultants are telling her that soon she will be able to fully breastfeed Amanda. Except that the feeds still take around 50 minutes, and without top-ups, Amanda would be admitted to the hospital.

We want Julia to be happy, but she says she's happy when Amanda is nursing, and the most important thing for her is to experience her breastfeeding journey. We don't know what to do. We don't know how to talk to her. 

This is why I'm here, asking all the nursing mums... Is it really worth the fight?

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP on Julia's thoughts regarding bottlefeeding and breastfeeding**

> **OOP:** She said she will never introduce bottles and that breastfeeding counts only if the baby is nursing at the breast. If not for the donors milk, Amanda would already be in the hospital... She is 9 weeks old and looks like a newborn

**Commenter 1:** It’s worth talking to your brother about this, but not much else you can do. It’s not your baby

> **OOP:** My brother said that he doesn't recognise Julia anymore, but he will take steps only when the baby ends up in the hospital

**Commenter 2:** There’s nothing wrong with bottle feeding. It’s recommended to do both so your baby has that skill developed. My son is 8 weeks and I didn’t give him a bottle for 4 weeks and now he’s refusing bottles 🥲. But trust me I understand your concern. You and your family need to be there for her and show your concern. She could also seek therapy because ppd definitely could be a cause here. But the tool I used for combo feeding is called a bridge tool. I would definitely recommend that to her.

> **OOP:** Somebody in another sub told me to leave Julia alone because she's doing her best, so I'm not going to talk to Julia anymore, and neither will my mum. I feel bad that I was worried because it seems like there is no problem here.
> 
> I hope I didn't offend anyone with this post, although it seems I did, and I'm sorry.

**Commenter 3:** I swear your sil is tired to her bones and wants to give up. But still preserving on for Amanda. To show your support, please make her lactation cookies and offer to bring food for her (well nourished mum will have output) or help with household chores to let her get more rest

> **OOP:** We cannot visit or bring her any food because she said we will try to poison her. We used to be friends so it makes me very sad. Nobody from the family saw Amanda in real life even though my brother begged her to show her to us.

**Is Julia's mother helping her with the baby?**

> **OOP:** Her mum cut her off after some drama right before the wedding. Like, we don't know what's happened, but nobody from her family ever contacted her anymore. We tried to be her family, and everything was fine before Amanda was born.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/NvO82Q7sSi): **September 2, 2025 (a bit over two weeks later)**

So I've published the first part of this story before on breastfeeding and mommit subreddits and I've been made feel like a monster because ""mother knows best"". For the record, we are in Europe. I'm sorry for my English, and also I'm extremely emotional.

My SIL Julia gave birth to a little Amanda 11 weeks ago. From the beginning, Amanda was barely growing, mostly losing weight instead of gaining. My country is heavily pro breastfeeding and Julia decided that she wanted to breastfeed. However, Amanda wasn't gaining weight properly and landed in 0.1 percentile for weight.

Julia forbade me and my mum from coming to visit them. She said we will poison her if we bring her food. It was surprising especially that before she gave birth, we were good friends. So we only saw little Amanda on pictures and videos my brother has been sending to us. And only once, my mum said she's worried because Amanda looked like she's hungry (she was crying and writhing, pushing her fists into her mouth) while Julia narrated on the video that this is how a happy baby looks like with a full belly. So my mum asked if Julia cannot give her a bottle because Amanda still seems hungry.

Julia went berserk and cut us off completely. She was pumping but her supply didn't go up at all. Amanda had a tongue tie resolved but it didn't help much. Julia was using donor's milk to top up Amanda's feeds through a sonde (I don't know what this thing is called).

Now, every week they're visiting a doctor's office for a control checkup of the weight. This is where it gets really messy. They were there yesterday. And yesterday, my brother called us crying that Amanda is in the hospital.

The story went like this: As always, Julia asked my brother to bring her coffee before the weighing appointment while she's using the nursing room to change Amanda's nappy. As always, he did. Except this time, a nurse went in in the middle of it to ask Julia about some paperwork. And the nurse saw that Julia was feeding Amanda from a bottle right before the check up... the bottle was 150cc of milk and it was already half down. The nurse said that Julia was supposed to wait with feeding until after the checkup, and then my brother came in.

He got very mad. He said that Julia refused giving Amanda the bottles so wtf was going on. Then he took the bottle, and at the same time Amanda vomited with a very, very thick milk. Nurse went crazy and checked the bottle and it was filled with milk mixed with rice cereal.

The doctor who's been called to see it immediately ordered moving Amanda to the hospital for an emergency check up especially after seeing Julia who went berserk and started throwing stuff around and yelling at everyone that she will be feeding her baby however and whenever she wants.

We went to the hospital to see my brother. Amanda already had her blood tests done and they showed some problems with kidneys, liver and vitamins level and iron. The doctors said she has been starving for a long time and why nobody from our family reacted. We told them the story about Julia claiming that we will poison her.

So the doctors immediately took Julia for a psych evaluation for PPD, but... turns out she was faking it. She admitted to the doctor (she was super scared that somebody might take the baby from her) that her friend told her that if she fakes PPD, we will leave her alone and she will have peace of mind during her breastfeeding.

The doctors then told her that what she did was not okay and that she was regularly stuffing the baby with milk and cereal before the weight checkup so as to pretend that Amanda grew. And that she should just give Amanda bottles with formula because this is about the little girl's life and survival as she's now failure to thrive and her life and health are in danger.

Julia got very mad. She yelled that she will either breastfeed Amanda or she won't feed her at all and that the choice is only hers because this is her baby and nobody else's.

Now this is when the doctors told Julia that either she will go for another psych evaluation or they call the police. Julia agreed for the evaluation and they locked her for a week.

My brother is working 14 hours per day because they are poor and after their wedding Julia decided she wants to be a traditional wife and he has to earn their living. So my brother said that whatever Julia is doing, it must be right. But after seeing what was happening, he got super mad. He said that she starved Amanda on purpose for her own sick satisfaction even though he was working hard on providing money so they would be able to buy formula if needed. He said he wanted divorce and full custody over Amanda. We don't k ow if he will get it because it's rare for dad to take care of their daughters. Also the doctors are mad at him that he didn't notice what Julia was doing.

Before Julia went to the ward, I got angry and told her that she made monsters out of us and that we were just worried about her and Amanda. And that thos whole situation was always only about Julia and her ""breastfeeding journey"" and not about Amanda's life. She called me a b*tch and said I should’ve died in childhood because nobody can love an autistic person like me.

AITA?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received mixed reactions, but was heavily leaning toward NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP responds to a comment about women and breastfeeding**

> **OOP:** I know that women are very sensitive about breastfeeding. The other subs were very clear about it. That's why im asking. I don't like hurting people but I care about our little Amanda and I think she's the most important one in here and not Julia and her breasts

**Commenter 1:** This is heartbreaking to read. Your niece’s health should always come before your SIL’s pride or desire to exclusively breastfeed. It sounds like the doctors are finally stepping in, which is good, but your brother really needs to wake up and advocate for Amanda before things get worse.

> **OOP:** He admits he made a lot of mistakes. He said he always trusted Julia and wanted the best for her and Amanada. He says he hates himself for what happened.
> 
> My mum said we'll help him financially as much as we can. I also hope Julia will be okay. I really liked her before everything that happened and she was always kind to me and was never bothered that I'm autistic. But mostly I pray for Amanda.

**Commenter 2:** NTA. Julia is very mentally ill and was willing to kill her baby to maintain some weird illusion.

> **OOP:** The doctors say she may have schizophrenia or some kind of psychosis or very dangerous mania. But if after the evaluation they find out nothing she probably won't get Amanda back.

**Commenter 3:** Julia needs to be in a mental institution for a while for Amanda's health. Clearly she isn't making rational decisions based on the best interest of her child. Your brother should document everything, get affidavits from the doctors and nurse who witnessed this behavior and onto court to get temporary custody or a restraining order or whatever the equivalents are in your country because keeping Amanda away from Julia for a while is critical. Support your brother as much as possible

> **OOP:** She will be locked for a week. And then we will see what happens. We're very anxious

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/K8cwHoPc5M): **September 3, 2025 (next day)**

UPDATE AITA for telling my SIL that breastfeeding is not about her journey but about her starving baby

I got so many comments under my original post and so many private messages that I am unable to reply to each and everyone so I figured I'll post a short update.

First of all, our little Amanda is doing good and stays in the hospital. She's being fed with formula and bottles (my brother had to agree to this) and since yesterday gained 30 g. She had more tests done and we're waiting for the results. The doctors are also worried about the fact that Julia forcefed Amanda with cereal mixed with donor milk before the appointments because apparently it can cause some problems with digestive system in the future especially that they don't know for how long she's been doing it and she doesn't want to admit it.

Secomd, thank you all for your support. Also, thank you for the comments stating that we let Amanda down and put her in danger. Me and my mum realise it and we feel terrible about it.

Some people were questioning what happened because my previous post in other groups stated that Julia is feeding Amanda and that she's doing everything she can to provide milk for her. And yes that is true, this is what we knew at that time. We didn't know Julia decided that it's either breastmilk or nothing at all. She only said this in front of the doctors.

My brother took vacation at work and most of his time he stays with Amanda but he will be moving in with us. All this time he's been working and later doing overtime under the hand and he feels exhausted but says he had no other choice. He promised he will do everything he can to be a good father.

We don't have any information about Julia but no matter what we worry about her. She's our family as well. She doesn't have her own family (she said before the wedding that she and the rest of her family had a fight and they cut her off so she is alone in this world and we felt very sorry for her).

We managed to get in touch with one of Julia's friends Linda who was donating milk to her. Linda was terrified with the story and admitted she was the one who told Julia to pretend that she's afraid of us poisoning her. All of it because Linda's MIL was demanding to visit them after the birth so she used this excuse for people to leave her alone. And apparently Julia said to Linda before giving birth that Amanda is only hers and only she has the right to hold her, and Michael (my brother) if really needed. And I don't understand this because my mum never asked to hold Amanda. In the hospital, two days ago, it was the first time we saw Amanda in real life.

Linda also told us that she introduced Julia to The Milk League (???) and there she found out all the bad things about formula and bottle feeding. Also it turns out she never wanted to vaccinate Amanda but my brother forced her to. Linda said she recommended Julia a couple of lactation consultants who apparently weren't real educated LCs but some women with instagram accounts claiming to know a lot about breastfeeding.

This is all for now. This is all the information I gathered. The most important to me is that Amanda is safe with the doctors and nurses. I will update whenever I know something more if you want.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I would want to contact Julia’s family to find out why there is NC. Maybe this isn’t her first mental breakdown. Definitely need the background and family medical history for Amanda’s sake.

> **OOP:** My brother said that this is what the doctors ask him to do. They said that certain mental illnesses can be in the family and they would like to know what's going on. My brother will try to contact them but we have never seen them so it's a bit complicated.

**Commenter 2:** Hopefully he tries a bit harder than he did at being a proper parent. Anyone with half a brain cell can tell the difference between a fed baby, and a starving one. Even if he was working 16 hours a day, all it takes is 30 seconds to ***look at his child***. I've been told by 2 different family lawyers that (at least in the US), a large reason that fathers have the alleged difficulty in getting sole custody is simply because they don't try. They assume they won't get it, so they don't fight for it. In his case, his wife tried to starve her baby because she's crazy. So he better step up. I suspect that his hours will actually go *down* if he isn't having to pay for his wife's needs on top of his child.

> **OOP:** The doctors told him that he screwed up and that he is a parent too. We're afraid they'll take Amanda away because of it. My mum already scheduled a meeting with a lawyer

**Commenter 3:** I hope you are in a place that will give your brother full custody. I don’t think Julia is mentally capable of caring for a child.

> **OOP:** The thing is that Michael messed up as well. And he knows. We just hope they won't take Amanda away because of this

**Commenter 4:** I love how everyone is acting like the brother is a victim. He should be charged for neglect too. The fact that he isn't makes me suspect this is fake.

Imagine what a shit father you have to be for this to go on so long and you don't even notice!

Both your brother and his wife should be charged with neglect.

> **OOP:** Right now nobody is being charged. YET. But he knows he is guilty as well as he knows Amanda might be taken away. My mum scheduled a meeting with a lawyer. This is the only thing we can do for now. I'll update when I know more

**Commenter 5:** How long did your brother know Julia before marrying her? I'm sure there is more to the family cut-off story. This is not someone who is mentally well and I doubt this is the first time this has caused a crisis

> **OOP:** Almost one year. She told him she's from a religious family and she won't be waiting long for the wedding. He never met her family because she said they should meet only during the wedding. But they cut her off like 2 months before that

1nd48zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/1nd48zo/dating_in_nova_and_dc_cheat_sheet/,Dating in NOVA and DC Cheat Sheet,"In light of recent posts about the woes of single life I'd like to share with you my cheat sheet for dating in this area.

I've been on hundreds (not an exaggeration) of dates over the last two decades here. On the whole this is a pretty good place for both men and women to find a partner. But there are many mistakes I've made and I see friends and Redditors make. 

So hear me out and learn from my pain, loneliness, and occasional desperation. 

1. Dating takes practice. Few people are good at it naturally. And if they are, they're probably a sociopath. It's OK to go on ""practice dates."" At the very least you get to know someone different than you. Source: It took me at least 50 dates before I figured out how dumb I was on my first 5. 
2. Be fit. Or at least fit enough. DC is one of the fittest cities in the world. You don't have to be an Ironman Triathlete but if you're 50 lbs. or more overweight you will have a hard time finding someone. Source: I've been 50 lbs. overweight and I had a hard time. It got easier as I lost weight.
3. If you aren't asking someone out within the first 20 minutes of interaction you're doing it wrong. Stop with the back and forth texts. Stop expecting the other person to make the move. Ask them out for a drink of coffee at a coffee shop or bar you know and like. This is especially true for women -- if you can't find a guy, ask yourself, ""When is the last time I made a first move or asked someone out?"" If the answer is ""Never"" or ""Seldomly"", it's your fault. It doesn't matter how many ""signals"" you think you've sent. Especially true if who you are interested is somehow tied to your professional circle -- guys have a lot more to lose than women by making the first move. Source: I've had this discussion too many times with my female friends. 
4. Stop being overly picky early on. It's easy to dismiss people and then complain about it. ""He's not 6-6-6"" or ""She's only a 5 when I will only date a 7 or above."" STFU and get over yourself. Message them. If they're cool, go hang out. Source: I'm neither ""6-6-6"" nor a ""7"". 
5. Find interests the other gender will find interesting to discuss. If your hobbies are predominantly gender-specific they will make for terrible first date discussions. Are you a dude into cars and watches? Shut up about them. A chick into Harry Potter, Minions t-shirts, Disney, skin care? Few guys are going to want to listen about your trip to the Magical Kingdom. Interest that work well are  travel, maybe sports, and certain kinds of pop culture. Source: I've been on dates where I (painfully) listened to someone tell me about Club 33. 
6. I'm going to get flak for this one but I believe it to be true -- fine dining makes for crappy first dates. So do loud environments, movies, and the Holocaust Museum. First dates should be casual, easy, and all about conversation. Oh, and split the check -- especially if it's two professionals going on a first date. Source: I've been a meal ticket for more than a few people. Source: I was asked on a date to the Holocaust Museum. It went as bad as you think it would.  
7. On a similar note -- don't over-prepare for a first date. Women, don't spend hours doing hair, nails, or makeup. Men, don't break out your best suit or show up in an Uber Black. ""Impressing"" someone on a first date rarely works because there's a good chance they won't value the same things as you. Source: I've disappointed so many women who spend money on a manicure only to have me not notice. 
8. Tread carefully about work topics. With the right career-interested in person they can be a great thing to bond over.

So if you're going on dates from apps but they all kind of suck, that might not be entirely your fault. 

There you have it. 20 years of dating on and off in the DMV summed up into a few bullet points. You will get judged. You will get rejected. But you will also get better. Probably. You might also end up old and single. ",2,1757476781.0,nova,2,0.63,False
1nd48sk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DIVATHEA/comments/1nd48sk/the_ultimate_guide_to_linen_properties_care/,"The Ultimate Guide to Linen: Properties, Care & Storage","# Understanding Linen

Linen stands apart as one of humanity's oldest and most cherished textiles. Derived from the fibers of the flax plant (*Linum usitatissimum*), this remarkable fabric has adorned people across civilizations for thousands of years. The journey from flax plant to wearable garment involves an intricate process that contributes to linen's distinctive character and exceptional qualities.

The unique structure of flax fibers gives linen its signature properties. Unlike the soft, fuzzy fibers of cotton, flax produces longer, stronger fibers with a natural shine. These fibers are hollow at their core, creating microscopic channels that allow air to flow freely through the fabric. This structural difference is what makes linen feel so refreshingly cool against your skin, even on the hottest summer days.

Perhaps most remarkably, linen actually improves with age. Each wash softens the fibers without compromising their integrity, creating a garment that becomes more comfortable over time while maintaining its structural strength. This quality makes linen not just a purchase but an investment that rewards you with increasing comfort through the years.

The tactile experience of wearing linen is unlike any other fabric. Its slightly textured surface creates a subtle massage-like effect against the skin, while its temperature-regulating properties keep you comfortable across a range of climates. This combination of sensory qualities creates that ineffable feeling of well-being that linen enthusiasts often describe when wearing their favorite pieces.

# Washing Your Linen: Foundations of Proper Care

The washing process forms the cornerstone of proper linen care. With the right approach, each wash will not only clean your garment but actually improve its hand feel and drape. Understanding the fundamental principles of washing linen will help you avoid common pitfalls that can diminish the beauty and longevity of your garments.

The washing process forms the cornerstone of proper linen care. With the right approach, each wash will not only clean your garment but actually improve its hand feel and drape. Understanding the fundamental principles of washing linen will help you avoid common pitfalls that can diminish the beauty and longevity of your garments.

# Water Temperature

Always use cold to lukewarm water (60-85°F/15-30°C). Hot water can weaken fibers and cause significant shrinkage of up to 10% in the first wash. The naturally strong flax fibers don't require hot water to release dirt and stains

# Detergent Selection

Choose mild, pH-neutral detergents free from optical brighteners, bleach, and fabric softeners. Enzyme-based cleaners designed for delicates work well. For colored linen, use detergents formulated to preserve dyes. The amount matters4use half the recommended dose to prevent soap build-up.

# Washing Method

Machine washing on gentle cycle works well for most linen items. Use a mesh laundry bag for extra protection. For delicate or heavily embellished pieces, hand washing provides greater control. Either way, avoid overloading to ensure thorough cleaning without excessive agitation.

# Addressing Common Stains

Linen's absorbent nature means it can be vulnerable to staining. Prompt action is key4the longer a stain sets, the more difficult removal becomes. Here's how to address common culprits:

**Red Wine:** 

Immediately blot (don't rub) with a clean cloth. Cover with salt to absorb moisture, then rinse with cold water. For persistent stains, mix equal parts hydrogen peroxide and dish soap, apply gently, and rinse thoroughly.

**Oil/Grease:**

Sprinkle with cornstarch or baby powder to absorb excess oil. Let sit for 30 minutes, then brush away. Treat remaining stain with dish soap, gently working it into the fabric before washing normally.

**Coffee/Tea:** 

Flush immediately with cold water from the back of the stain. For stubborn marks, soak in a solution of white vinegar and water (1:3 ratio) for 30 minutes before washing.

**Ink:**

Dab with alcohol-based hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol using a cotton ball. Work from the outside of the stain inward to prevent spreading. Rinse thoroughly before washing.

*Remember that linen's natural fibers respond best to gentle, patient care. Aggressive scrubbing or harsh chemicals may remove the stain but can damage the fabric structure in the process. When in doubt, consult a professional cleaner who specializes in natural fibers.*

# Drying and Ironing: Preserving Linen's Character

How you dry your linen garments significantly impacts both their immediate appearance and long-term condition. The drying process affects everything from the fabric's softness and drape to its dimensional stability and color retention. While linen is remarkably resilient, thoughtful drying practices will preserve its beauty and extend its lifespan.

**Air Drying:** The Gold Standard Air drying represents the gentlest method for linen and yields the best results. Remove items from the wash while still slightly damp, shake out wrinkles, and either lay flat on a clean towel or hang on a padded hanger. Avoid direct sunlight, which can fade colors, and never wring or twist linen when wet as this can distort the fibers.

**Machine Drying:** With Caution If time constraints necessitate machine drying, use the lowest heat setting and remove items while still slightly damp (about 80% dry). Place linen garments in a mesh bag to minimize friction with the drum and add clean tennis balls or dryer balls to help maintain shape and reduce wrinkles. Never over dry linen, as this makes the fibers brittle.  
  
**Seasonal Storage: Protecting Your Linen Investment**

Proper storage between seasons is crucial for maintaining the quality and appearance of your linen garments. Unlike synthetic fabrics, natural linen requires specific conditions to prevent damage during periods of disuse. With thoughtful preparation and the right environment, your linen pieces will emerge from storage looking beautiful and ready to wear season after season.

# Pre-Storage Preparation

The condition in which you store your linen garments directly impacts how they'll look when you retrieve them. Taking the time to properly prepare items for storage pays dividends in preserved quality and appearance.

**Thorough Cleaning:**  Always store linen completely clean. Even invisible food particles or body oils can attract insects and cause yellowing or permanent staining over time. Follow the washing guidelines outlined earlier, ensuring garments are thoroughly rinsed of all detergent residue which can weaken fibers during storage.

**Ironing Consideration:** While not necessary for preservation, lightly ironing linen before storage can help prevent deep-set wrinkles from forming. If you choose this approach, ensure the garment is completely cool before folding to prevent creating sharp creases that can stress the fibers over time.

**Proper Drying:** Ensure garments are 100% dry before storage4even slight moisture can lead to mildew growth and musty odors that are difficult to remove. Air dry completely, then leave items in a well-ventilated area for an additional 24 hours to eliminate any trace humidity that might be trapped in the fibers.

**Button Closure:** Button all buttons, zip all zippers, and close all closures before storage. This helps garments maintain their proper shape and prevents distortion that can occur when items are folded with elements hanging loose or misaligned.

**Location Selection:** Choose a cool, dry, well-ventilated storage area away from external walls and heating sources. Avoid attics and basements which often experience temperature fluctuations and humidity issues. The ideal storage environment maintains consistent temperature (6075°F/15-24°C) and moderate humidity (30-50%).

**Container Choices:** Use acid-free cotton or linen garment bags for hanging items, and acid-free tissue paper between folds for items stored flat. Avoid plastic containers completely4 they trap moisture and prevent fabric from breathing. Cedar chests provide excellent protection, as cedar naturally repels insects without harsh chemicals.

**Organization Method:** For hanging storage, use padded or wooden hangers that support the garment's shape without creating pressure points. For folded storage, avoid stacking items too high, as the weight can create permanent creases. Refold stored items every 2-3 months to prevent stress lines from setting permanently.

**Natural Protection:** Place lavender sachets or cedar blocks near stored linen to naturally deter moths and other insects. Replace or refresh these natural repellents every 3-4 months to maintain effectiveness. Avoid mothballs, which contain chemicals that can damage natural fibers and leave persistent odors.

For those new to linen, building a collection of pieces that work together creates versatility and maximizes your investment. Starting with a few foundational items allows you to experience linen's benefits across different contexts while learning how it moves and changes with your body.

CakeClub® is a financial wellness app that tries to make money management actually fun (yes, really). Most budgeting tools feel like detention — they just punish you for spending. CakeClub flips that: it shows you what you *can* do with your money instead of just what you can’t.

**Core features:**

* Tracks spending automatically
* Sets up budgets in under 2 minutes
* Shows you how to maximize credit card rewards & cashback
* Sends real-time alerts so you don’t overspend
* Builds a community around financial confidence

**The market**  
Gen Z and young millennials — about 80M+ in the U.S. — are drowning in financial anxiety. Mint is dead, incumbents like YNAB feel like homework, and most “budget” apps haven’t figured out how to mix utility with dopamine.

**Competition & comparison**

* Mint: gone (RIP).
* YNAB: powerful, but intimidating and $14.99/mo.
* Copilot: slick, but very “finance bro” and not playful. CakeClub aims to be the Bugatti of budgeting apps, luxury design, playful interface, and community vibes. Think *Headspace for money*.

**Stage we’re at**  
Freshly live on the App Store. Downloads are trickling in. Zero revenue yet, but plenty of feedback that people like the look/feel. Now we need to fix the “downloads → paying users” gap.

**Conversion strategy**

* Coffee shop flyers with promo codes (because caffeine and panic go hand in hand).
* TikTok/IG creators talking about “money shame” in funny, relatable ways.
* 14-day free trial, then subscription. Pricing experiment in progress.

**Why us?**  
We’ve got a lean but obsessed team:

* CEO/founder (me) = fintech nerd + designer of the app.
* Executive Chair = literal finance legend (wrote *Master Your Cash Flow®*).
* Dev team = solid iOS/Firebase crew. Basically, no rich daddy, just sweat, tears, and way too much cold brew.

I started out in a front office role at the bank. After X years I have a coffee chat with a Product/Tech executive who presented on a team call. I speak to him and some members of his staff out of interest in the work they’re doing. They rave about the impact they’re having, the cool work they’re doing, and the excitement they face every day on the job. Seems like an interesting gig - very tech forward and high-impact.

Team is hiring. I interview and get the offer. I’m on the fence but the team lead hypes up the role for its problem solving aspects and the experience I’ll gain and leverage for a successful career - e.g., The opportunity to influence / transform / digitize several processes that I found archaic in the front office.

Once I get there, nothing is as they described it. Manual processes, PowerPoint, data entry. We’re the opposite of tech forward. Bureaucracy everywhere that slows progress to a snail’s pace. No one seems to know what they’re doing. And worst of all, the EDs/MDs hold closed door meetings and box me out of senior level presentations (often times using materials or content I made and taking credit for it). In meetings I do get invited to nothing gets done. Then when stakeholders come around we all hide behind a pretty deck and leave out all the chaos going on on the ground. 

I also don’t build any transferable skills. Entire org seems bloated too, and there’s often times not enough work to go around. It’s like everything I thought I was working to fix in the front office is actually 10x worse on the team I joined, who for some reason lied to me to recruit me out of a stable, high visibility role with established career progression. The front office may be archaic but at least they get stuff done.

I know it was my fault for leaving my job without doing proper due diligence, asking the right questions, or talking to more team members. Now that I’ve found myself stuck in a hole in a shitty job market with no marketable skills, I’ve learned my lesson.

1nd3yo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JEEAdv26dailyupdates/comments/1nd3yo0/update_1_1_day_1_chapter/,[UPDATE #1] 1 day 1 chapter,"for context you could read my previous post.

you're lovely test subject is back to update about the experiment.

*This method may seem absurd to people who are able to follow long lecs and do questions in a proper manner, if you are mentally and physically able to follow long lecs and do advanced level questions, good for you but this is for dummies like me, itna time waste kr liye hai why not try my method for 1 day, you'll have the confidence you are looking for. In this method we shift learning from lectures to learning from questions.*

**Update #1**  
1.Used the method to do 2 new chapters, ngl it works just fine. I did AC and Vector algebra.  
2.The jee brief 2hr oneshots are too good.I have been sleeping on the physics teacher there for too long but he's good and explains everything conceptually brainless ratta kam marna padta hai as compared to when I only did eduniti. best part agar kuch bilkul na samaj aaye to the longer oneshot is aways there to clarify that specific part.  
3.mostly 1x pe dekna padta hai while making notes and rewind bhe krna padta hai but pura concept clear ho jata hai.

**System update:**

1. Watch some very short oneshot and **memorise** all the formulas, like form mindmaps and use blurting. (spend max 3hr doing this).

2.Before jumping straight to pyqs, do the examples of the revision notes on marks app, the solutions there are surprisingly good, if not you can always paste it on google for vid solution.

3. finish the above 2 steps as fast as possible cuz you are most vulnerable during this time, once you start doing pyqs you won't even feel like procrastinating, start doing pyqs till 2019 in sets of 30,

**\[most imp\]**  
**add new concepts to your notes, and mistakes to your mistake copy**  
**do this timebound, agar koi q click nehi kr rha leave it immediately and come back after your set is done.**

ain't no way you'll not feel confident after doing 130 pyqs.

4. give the advanced climb of marks app as test and notedown your marks  
5.make 1 page short notes of imp things you keep forgetting (DONT FUCKING WRITE EVERYTHING , you will need to read notes no matter what, with all those new concept points and mistakes you added, you gotta treat it as treasure). stick that on your wall.

**future plans:**

1. for inorganic, after watching oneshot gotta read highlighted ncert and make notes in my own ncert, [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fnu7olSdkV9\_1nDzYuZqHIEHVwsnQxzU](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fnu7olSdkV9_1nDzYuZqHIEHVwsnQxzU)
2. organic im still unsure, for this ig need to watch good lectures, I like ns sir so I'll watch that, but not now, aint no way ill break this momentum bohut mushkil se padhna start kra hai.
3. the best revision strategy I could think of is giving a 3 hr test everyday, starting from tomorrow, i'll just create a test on marks app with the unattempted pyqs of all topics I have done. The idea is to eventually shift to doing module as test, eg to fulfil a quota of 30qs per subject, did 20 qs from shm and 10 questions from emi.

I plan on using the esaral module ke first 2 ex for now as unke vid solution available hai, I want to do this cuz ek to module se I'll get practice of all topics which pyqs lack+using this strategy, I can prolong a chapter for 5 or more days which will ensure it fits more into the memory. + i'll soon take jee mates test series by competishun as its the cheapest I could find, they have tests every sunday.

(I wanna do marks app tests for a few days before starting this cuz marks app ke tests are actually time bound. prolly don't spend more than 4 hrs on test+analysis)

weekend pe, just reattempt all pyqs, not selected but all, since while using this you'll make alot of mistakes and its difficult to mark so many questions, so after reattempting its sure that we are done with the chap and the questions we are unable to solve this time are the ones that get marked.

4. Im gonna update the schedule, after lunch watch the oneshot then after that do illustrations+60 pyqs so the learning is done and next day morning, with more confidence complete the pyqs by 10, then give 3hr test+analysis then have lunch.

**Bonus:**  
1.Take my plan as an idea, no plan can help you better than the one which you make optimized for your optimal performance.  
2.**don't think too much** especially between the time you are doing lec and start doing pyqs, you may think ki concept nehi samaj aaya hai eduniti dek leta hu, short vid dek leta hai, BIG FUCKING NO, read notes and memorize that shit, samaj nehi aaya let it be, just memorise and form a mindmap which you can recite without looking at your notes. These are times when you will procrastinate, the whole point of watching short lec and doing 1 chap,1 day is to minimise the scope of procrastination. RATTA MARO, after doing 100 pyqs, you'll have better understanding of the chapter than most people who even watch long lecs.  
3. I will keep updating cuz this is my only source of entertainment, I dont go out or anything, I always appreciate your dms.  
4. I have a really bad coffee addiction, I have 2 cups of coffe a day, I can't stop even though it increases my anxiety, I feel like I have had 1 hour of sleep the night if I skip my morning coffee, I'll really appreciate if anyone could share their experience dealing with it.

I’m pretty new to counting calories, and overall it’s been going really well. I’ve learned a ton. The only thing is, I’ve been dealing with some weird stomach pain that’s starting to worry me.
	•	Yesterday I had a yogurt parfait with chia seeds (soaked overnight in the fridge), and by the end of the day my stomach was hurting.
	•	Last week, I tried mixing my protein shake with coffee (not something I usually do), and a few hours later I had stomach pain again.
	•	The worst was when I had protein ice cream with banana  my stomach hurt so badly I honestly wanted to cry .idk if I’m allergic to bananas or if it was the protein.  

For context, I do struggle with health anxiety/hypochondria, so that doesn’t help. I do have a doctor’s appointment in two weeks and plan to bring it up then, but I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced something similar. Also i fear the doc saying “oh it’s nothing” -.- 

Could it be dairy, protein powders, even the chia seeds? Has anyone dealt with this kind of stomach pain before when staring to track
Calories ?

Thanks in advance!

I'm so thankful;  wanted to let you guys know that not only my resisting 9yo got baptized on the Forefeast of the Nativity of the Theotokos, but my 12yo fell in such love w/ the church over Pascha that she was chrismated & has joined excitedly as well. I think having 1 older sister to back her up was all she really needed not to feel so alienated in the family & my 12yo is much less sensitive & equal to taking on any snarking from her sisters; the older girls have since backed off all comments though they declined to attend. My 19yo did though, she's his favorite sister.   
They've been attending every Fri. morning service & coffee hour discussion all summer to ask questions (this is such a blessing as home-schoolers, I encourage ya'll to ask your priests for one, even if monthly) & 12yo is still attending all of the catachumen classes as she missed a few due to summer camps. Now she wants to visit a monastery for her birthday next year.   
9yo is happy, she feels like we're mostly a family again & finally feels her godmother is her real godmother, that was a separate guilty weight on her that has been lifted. Thank you to those who said a prayer!",2,1757475231.0,OrthodoxChristianity,0,1.0,False

I wanted to host an event at my apartment in northgate seattle this summer with my freinds. Unfortunately all of my eastside freinds said things like if I move to Bellevue they would consider coming over.

Is this snobby!!

My friends gave reasons like even during the daytime they are afraid my northgate neighborhood is unsafe.

They call my northgate nieghborhood the ghetto or the hood.

All of my freinds are white Caucasian. Im also white Caucasian.

What I don't understand is these same friends come to seattle for Mariners games and the Seattle Acquiruim and the Paramount theater. Why are they afraid of my northgate apartment??

Last week I drove my car to pike place seattle and parked in the parking structure. I had a Sunday morning coffee and pastry alone at le panier bakery. 

I didnt feel unsafe at all around pikes place at 8.30am on a Sunday morning.

I know i have posted over and over again on this forum about moving from northgate to Bellevue. Even though I said it's for safety reasons it's also pressure from my friends too!!

My apartment and apartment building in northgate seattle where I have lived for 10 years I really like. 

I dont understand the big deal of coming over to my northgate apartment from the eastside for a bbq or get together is??",0,1757475192.0,SeattleWA,38,0.39,False

Here’s a fun way to learn about the characteristics of Fire, Water, Air, and Earth signs

# 1. You text: ""I’m sad.""

# 🔥 Fire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius):

“WHAT HAPPENED? WHO DO I NEED TO FIGHT?”  
They’re ready with a pep talk, a spontaneous plan to cheer you up, and possibly to throw hands on your behalf.

# 🌊 Water (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces):

*“I’m coming over. I brought tissues, ice cream, and your favorite blanket.”*  
They’ll cry with you if needed. Emotional support? They invented it.

# 🌬 Air (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius):

“Sad like… existential dread or just tired of people?”  
They’ll want to analyze it, offer perspectives, and maybe send you a meme that weirdly helps.

# 🌍 Earth (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn):

“Okay. I booked you a massage. Dinner’s on me. You need rest.”  
Solutions + stability = their love language.

# 2. Group project gone wrong. Chaos. No one did their part.

# 🔥 Fire:

“Fine. I’ll just do everything myself-and make it epic.”  
Loud, dramatic, takes charge like a hero in a movie.

# 🌊 Water:

“I felt like something was off… should we talk about it first?”  
They’ll want to understand *why* it went wrong before fixing it.

# 🌬 Air:

“Let’s regroup. I made a spreadsheet of everyone’s tasks.”  
They become the impromptu project manager with 12 tabs open.

# 🌍 Earth:

“This is why I did my part a week ago.”  
They’re irritated-but will still clean up the mess for everyone.

# 3. You’re running late to a flight.

# 🔥 Fire:

“RUNNN! We got this!!”  
Pumping adrenaline like it’s an action movie. No panic, just vibes.

# 🌊 Water:

*“What if we miss it? What if we get stranded forever?”*  
Mild meltdown. Will need hand-holding at the gate.

# 🌬 Air:

“Okay, Plan B: What are our rebooking options? Let me talk to the airline.”  
Calm chaos coordinator energy.

# 🌍 Earth:

“I told you to leave earlier.”  
They’re already at the gate with coffee and snacks, judging you (lovingly).

# 4. A friend is getting back with their toxic ex.

# 🔥 Fire:

“NOPE. Not on my watch.”  
Big dramatic reaction. Might DM the ex with a threat.

# 🌊 Water:

“I just want you to be happy… but do you think they’ve really changed?”  
Worried but soft. They’ll support you – but also cry later.

# 🌬 Air:

“Okay but… why? Let’s break this down logically.”  
They’ll bring charts, past evidence, and a debate-style intervention.

# 🌍 Earth:

“Here’s a list of everything they did last time. Proceed with caution.”  
They won’t stop you, but they *will* remind you they told you so.

# 5. You’re planning a surprise birthday party.

# 🔥 Fire:

“I’m planning the entrance, the playlist, and my outfit. It’s going to be iconic.”  
Turns it into a full production with drama and glitter.

# 🌊 Water:

“I’ve been working on a memory book and a slideshow of baby photos.”  
Goes all in on emotional value and personal touches.

# 🌬 Air:

“Let’s make a shared doc. I have six theme ideas and a poll ready.”  
Creative and organized. Also texts 12 people without breaking a sweat.

# 🌍 Earth:

“I’ll handle the logistics-venue, food, budget. We need this done right.”  
The glue holding it all together while everyone else panics.

# 🔚 Final Thoughts:

Each element brings something powerful and priceless:  
🔥 Fire brings passion and action.  
🌊 Water brings heart and empathy.  
🌬 Air brings ideas and connection.  
🌍 Earth brings structure and stability.

1nd3kii,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bellrona/comments/1nd3kii/antlers/,Antlers,"He used to be one hell of a ranger, they said. Not to my face of course, but I heard them. Whispering when I had my morning coffee at the diner, speaking in hushed tones when they thought I’d walked out of earshot on the street, murmuring at the ranger’s station when I returned from the hospital only to turn in my resignation. Seven years as a ranger, a lifetime career guaranteed. Now he’s throwing that all away because of what? Because of Doyle, because of Reynolds, because of little Cassy Edwerds.

Cassy and her identical twin sister, Lilie had been on a camping trip with their father, Danny Edwerds, at an unmarked camping spot above the ridge. It wasn’t too far from the main camping area but tucked away enough to feel secluded. Not an easy hike for two seven year olds, but relatives later told us the girls hiked and camped often with their father and had experience with rougher terrain. They had registered at the ranger station for a three night stay. I had been on duty that morning and had been charmed by the polite little girls with their matching yellow rainboots and curly blonde hair. They had chattered excitedly to each other about making smores and whether they’d see any deer. Mr. Edwerds had smiled lovingly at them and ruffled their hair, thanking me for the ‘Junior Ranger’ stickers I gave to each girl. The trio walked out the door holding hands and I didn’t think of them again until three days later when my fellow ranger, Doyle, approached me with a clipboard.

“Everyone scheduled to check out today is accounted for except one group, ‘Edwerds’,” he said, flipping the front paper on the clipboard back and forth to check.

My breath hitched, “Shit, that’s the guy with his two little girls.”

We responded quickly, Doyle, myself and another ranger, Reynolds, moved through the forest quickly, racing against dusk. What we found was beyond horrific. We could tell from the moment the blue tent came into view that it wasn’t going to be good. The fabric was shredded, looking more like birthday streamers hung on a pole than the remnants of a double wide tent. Charred remains of a bonfire disintegrated under our boots as we approached. We heard the buzzing of flies before we saw the bodies, but the first clue was the smell. Metallic and earthy, with something else, something older and offensive and mossy. Reynolds parted the shreds of the tent and immediately turned back and vomited on his boots.”Don’t,” he told me, but I ignored him and stepped inside.

Mr. Edwerds was closest to what would have been the zippered entrance to the tent. He had died trying to protect his girls, eviscerated from left hip to right shoulder and now laying prone on the packed earth. His eyes were glassy and open but rigor mortis had not set in yet. The smell was awful, but not as awful as what lay behind him. The tiny body was nearly unrecognizable but for the yellow rainboot on its one remaining foot. Bile forced its way up my throat and I turned, joining Reynolds on the ground. Doyle didn’t vomit but turned white-green and shook violently, eyes scanning the campground, “We gotta call this in.”

“There were two of them,” I spoke up, queasily, “two little girls.”

Doyle inhaled sharply before turning on his heel and re-entering the ruined tent. He returned only a moment later and this time, he did vomit. Wiping his mouth he confirmed what I already knew, “There’s only two bodies in there.”

I didn’t know which girl was missing, couldn’t remember their names. But I knew we had to find her. The ground around the campsite was destroyed. There were deep gouges in the dirt and blood splattered in wide arcs. We found dozens of drag marks, but they all seemed uniform and parallel, almost like something had walked with limbs dragging rather than marks made by pulling a small body from a massacre scene.

It was dark by this point and we searched by flashlight, awaiting reinforcements that may or may not be coming as staffing at the station had been short lately. I was ten yards from the camp site when the buzzing of flies that had become incessant suddenly stopped. I could see Reynolds’ and Doyle’s flashlights ahead of me in the forest also stop moving as they too noticed the sudden, complete silence. Suddenly, one of the flashlights shut off and I heard an impact that sounded like a car wreck, preceded only by Reynolds’ scream of pure terror and agony. I charged forward, and saw the other flashlight beam bouncing as Doyle ran too. We found Reynolds’ ruined, crumpled body slumped against the trunk of a tree, his spine twisted all the way around so his torso faced opposite of his feet. A groan emanated from his ruined form and we knelt down, horrified and perplexed at how he could still be breathing. His jaw was dislocated and hung sloped to one side of his face and beneath his ranger uniform I could see his shattered ribs poking through what should have been the back of his uniform. His lungs were exposed and they spat puffs of blood onto my hands, like little mouths gasping for breath.

“Ahntuluhers,” he choked, his backward knee twitching against my own as I held him.

“What?” Doyle pushed closer, putting his ear near Reynolds’ mouth.

“Ant-,” a wheezing cough, “-lers.” His body spasmed and then went slack. He slumped forward into the tree, the skin on his cheeks squished between the bark. His knees slid into the dirt and he twisted at all the wrong angles before finally coming to rest. Tears stung my eyes and I went to grab for Doyle’s arm when a scream pierced the silent night. It was Reynolds’ scream, but wrong, like a bad impression or garbled recording. My head swiveled back to Reynolds’ body but he hadn’t moved. The scream came again, closer and so wrong, distorting and disrespecting Reynolds’ voice. Doyle jumped up and ran only a few steps before a large, dark shape slammed into his body at an impossible speed. I heard the impact like a car crash again and took off running, my flashlight swinging wildly as my boots struggled to find purchase on the forest floor in my panic. Behind me a screaming moan pierced the silence, a mix of Reynolds’ and Doyle’s voices. I urged my body faster, branches whipping across my face. The bone-chilling scream came again and then something else, something worse. In a garbled mixture of my fallen ranger’s voices and a voice I vaguely recognized as Mr. Edwerds: “Cassy! Run!” The voice ended in a death rattle, a twisted recording of the death of Danny Edwerds.

I froze where I stood. Cassy. So the missing girl was Cassy. And she may still be alive.

“Daddy?” A small voice from in front of me shouted, “Daddy?”

I heard the forest to my left come alive, trees cracking as something large hurtled through the darkness and suddenly I knew what would happen if I didn’t get there first. Cassy Edwerds’ body would crumple against a tree just as Reynolds’ and Doyle’s had and her little voice would be added to the sick voice box of a murderous beast. I saw her ahead, small, afraid, covered in her father and sister’s blood. Her yellow rainboots were splattered with crimson. She stood in a small clearing, her eyes fixed on the tree line across from her. I scooped her up in her arms and she screamed, but then recognition flickered across her face and she clung to me.

“Do you see it?” She asked, raising a pale, trembling finger to trees.

A figure stepped into the clearing. Its body was that of a massive elk, but impossibly hunched. Long, twisted arms hung down to its feet, tipped with curved talons. Its face was elongated and skeletal, with waxy, pale skin stretched across its face like a crude mask. Holes in the skin on its cheeks showed sinewy muscle and moss and behind that, long, bloodstained teeth. Skin covered antlers protruded from its head and Reynolds’ final words became a frightening insight.

The creature opened its mouth impossibly wide and overlapping sounds and voices spilled from its mouth. First came sounds of death and garbled language, then with startling clarity I realized it was repeating snippets of conversations. Dozens of victims, different pitches and accents flowed from its jaws. I clutched Cassy in my arms, the little girl began to cry as she heard the voices of her father and sister come from the creature that had killed them.

“Don’t,” Reynolds’ voice and then an echoing retching sound, just as it had happened earlier when we had discovered the bodies. It had been listening then, observing us as we searched, waiting for us to split up before it picked us off one by one.

“There were two of them,” my own voice, wrong and muddled with moans and reverberating wheezes, “two of them. Two.” It’s gaping eye holes locked on mine as it said the last word and it began to gallop towards us. Its movements were so wrong, so inhuman, like its bones were trying to escape from under its skin. I ran, adrenaline making Cassy feel weightless in my arms. I ran until my lungs screamed and my head pounded and spots dotted my vision and then I ran some more. I didn’t stop until the floodlights of the ranger station blinded me and I dropped to my knees, cradling Cassy to my chest.

The floodlights turned to strobe lights as shadows passed in front of me, rangers running out of the station, officers and medics catching me as I collapsed. Someone took Cassy from my arms and wrapped her in a foil blanket, rushing her into a waiting ambulance.

“Where’s Reynolds? Where’s Doyle? What happened?” Multiple voices overlapped each other and my brain thought of the creature. A single word escaped my lips before my vision went black, “Antlers.”",1,1757474662.0,u_bellrona,0,1.0,False

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 31M and from the UK.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day 🤭. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath 🤗.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. 

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play video games. I'm obsessed with Satisfactory at the moment.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 6 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.

Alright, so school’s about to kick back in, and for a lot of people that means the _dreaded math class_. Whether it’s Calculus, Pre-Calc, Stats, or whatever your schedule decided to curse you with, I know how rough it can get. Math has this special talent for making smart, capable people feel like they’re banging their head against a wall, and honestly? It doesn’t have to be that way.



I’m offering free tutoring because I actually like this stuff (I know, weird flex) and I’ve seen how much easier it gets when someone just breaks things down. If you’re sitting there staring at a problem thinking “what even is this,” that’s where I come in.



I’m down to meet over coffee, run through problem sets, review before exams, or just sit with you while you try not to throw your textbook out the window. If you need someone to explain concepts from scratch, I’ll slow it down and walk you through. If you’d rather just power through homework together so it feels less miserable, we can do that too. And if you want me to just crank out the assignments while you breathe for a second, well… I’m not above that either.



So yeah, hit me up before you start Googling “math for dummies” :p

Lucky for me, I have a standard for my dates to be activities or places I will enjoy so that I have something of value to point to, no matter how it shakes out.

He took me to dinner (if you’ve never had tuna belly, you’ve got to, WOW), and then to a phenomenal play I have been dying to see (which he, unlike other men I mentioned it to, picked up and ran with instead of pretending like he didn’t notice, or acting like it was “too much”). No fuss no muss here- he bought the tickets, booked the reservation, kept track of the time, and did little things like help me up the steps when I was in heels, and pulled my chair for me to sit down. 

Basically, things I would do if I were a man courting a woman. Trust me, they all fucking know *how*. It’s just a case of who *wants* to, and prioritizes making you feel good (so that you actually desire them…that’s how it fucking works, guys) over the approval of the male audience in his head that will sabotage him via encouraging him to do the least he can do (laid out eloquently in an earlier post today!). Pleasing and making a woman light up on a date should be a point of pride for him- not humiliation. 

Of course, I looked my very best, and made him feel seen, heard, and appreciated. Interestingly enough, the labor I hate the most- gently but repeatedly dodging intimate touch shoehorned in at awkward times- was not labor I had to do tonight. This is often how it goes with gentlemen that court, they do more and cause you *less* stressful work. 

You have to make it clear what kind of dates you will go on. If you are looking for anything more than coffee, a walk, or a pub drink (ahem, all of which will likely take an hour…the same amount of time you can have lunch in at least! It is not *about* him keeping it short- most men will let dates go on for hours if 1) you allow it, 2) look decent, and 3) validate him- it’s *about* him keeping it cheap and not “doing too much”), you will get rejected. A lot. This is not a bad thing. That’s not who you want to be wasting time with. Hold out for high quality dates- it’s a superior experience, and even if it doesn’t work out long term (likely it does not), the thing you got to do, the food you got to eat, whatever the case is…that cannot be erased. 

If it doesn’t shake out, I *promise* you, being home Alone With Cat (or Dog) is a superior experience to sitting across from a guy on the most low effort date he could get away with, who’s just not into human connection enough to shoo away his imaginary male audience for the evening (again, thank you for that, u/HelenGonne !).

This is a date I will remember, even if I never see him again. Yes, I attribute it to his willingness. But I also give myself credit for daring to believe I am worth it. I would rather a handful of one off memorable dates like this over the course of a year with like 4 men, than consistently dating one lowballer for that year while pulling teeth to get him to value me.

What would bring you in?,"Hey Tacoma friends! I’ve been to a few places in other cities that combine a coffee shop (or bar) with a dog-friendly lounge, and it got me thinking… why don’t we have something like that here? Most places that are dog friendly have only patios and of course these tend to close in the winter. 

I’m imagining a “third space” that’s not totally home and not totally a bar, where you can:

	•	Bring your dog (off leash) to hang out, socialize, and play (safe, clean, indoor/outdoor setup)

	•	Meet friends or make new ones

	•	Enjoy coffee, tea, or maybe a cocktail/beer

	•	Work remotely during the day, or relax in the evenings

	•	Have a place to go even during Tacoma’s dark, rainy winters

I’d love your feedback:

	•	Would you visit a place like this?

	•	What would make it a must-visit for you?

	•	Any dealbreakers or things you’ve loved (or hated) at similar places?

	•	Would you come without a dog just to hang out?

The dog friendly space would be completely separated from the food and drink area. There is one very similar in Seattle called Coby’s, guessing King and Pierce counties laws are quite similar so it should be feasible.

Back story is that for medical reasons, I'm child-free and so I'll only date child free people.  Less heartbreak for both parties.

I'm a community volunteer and have been for a couple of years now. A new guy started recently and he asked me out. At that time I was really hesitant and quite shy, but he was persistent and seemed nice so I finally agreed to go out with him.

We spent some time together and we got on really well. The connection was there, the chemistry was there, I really liked him. I told him very quickly, like within the first week, I can't have children and so I would need to know that before I got involved.
He said he wasn't very sure on that and that he would need some time. I said fine.Take your time but I won't be able to get too invested until I know an answer because it is a hundred percent fixed for me.

We dated for 4 months. We checked in regularly, he told me he was in love with me, and I was falling for him.

At the end of 4 months I asked where he was with his decision. He said he didnt know and he needed another 1 to 2 weeks. I said at that point I need to stop seeing him in the interim because it was really painful for me and I felt insecure and unstable falling in love with a man who didn't know if he wanted to continue a relationship with me. He was hurt by this and I was hurt by the fact he wanted me to stay on the line indefinitely.

He told me he needed those couple weeks. I told him that I was really looking forward to hearing from him again and that I was going miss him.

Before he left, he confirmed that I meant it when I said I wanted to hear from him and I did because I really really care for him. He leaves, I have a big old cry and talk to my bestie.

A couple days later, I was feeling sad and decide to torture myself my looking at our shared document where we were planning dates. Devastated to see that he has deleted it. My friends told me not to give up hope yet, he's dealing with some pain. He needs some time as well.

He keeps watching all of my stories. I like to keep a record of things I'm eating or drinking or pretty flowers etc. It was horrible because it's reminding me of him every day and the fact that I'd usually be telling him about all these fun things I care about.

1 week passes: I hear nothing, I cry. 2 weeks pass: nothing, I'm devastated. I cry so so much. Pathetic, I'm aware. 3 weeks: now I'm kind of mad? He made the timeline and he's not following through. 

I remove him from seeing my story on 1 platform because it's the one I check and I dont want to keep seeing his face pop up. His friend starts watching it instead. He can still contact me everywhere and see 1 of 2 platforms.

I sent a mesaage to him twice. The first because I had some photos of his and it felt wrong to keep them. The second because I was going back to the volunteering after a short (medical) break and I didnt want him to be surprised (it felt inconsiderate?) He never opened either but was interacting in a group chat so I guess he was choosing to ignore them. I feel I've done my best to be fair and dont message him again. Not going to argue with someone who has chosen to ghost me.

I went back, and it was great! Seeing so many people there that I've missed and I felt successful in getting back to normalcy. He didn't speak to me in any way but passed me something at one point. It didn't seem like he wanted to communicate with me so I'm not going to pressure someone who doesn't like me.

Then the next day he messages me asking how we are because he feels a little surprised that I have returned. I am just stunned by this. I was a little petty and replied that he would've been less surprised if he hadn't ghosted me.

He said we had nothing to talk about since we broke up. He objected to me saying he'd ghosted. I reminded him what our conversation was and he said there had been a misunderstanding. He made sure to tell me how sad he had been and that he had been really hurt and had cried to a friend about it which felt manipulative. I told him not to tell me those things, that he had made a choice not to communicate with me, and he was really hurting me by doing that. 

He said he didn't want to text back at fourth and we should get a coffee which I agreed too. I don't know if that was stupid or not.

So we have this coffee lined up for a few days from now and I don't know what to do. I am still very much hoping, wishing, he was in my life. But at the same time he's hurt me really badly and it was such a short relationship.

I'm worried about the fact that he doesn't even acknowledge the things he said to me in that conversation and he's saying that it was just a misunderstanding. I was feeling really clear about what he told me he was going to do and he is trying to brush that away as a misunderstanding?
It's just so crushing for me. It's hard because I waited for him a really long time to get in touch with me and tell me what I wanted to hear or tell me that he wasn't interested in me. And now that he's seen me in person again, he's saying it was a misunderstanding. He hasn't actually told me anything real. He's just arguing about the semantics of what happened? I don't know what we're going to talk about. Whether he is just insulted that I've said he ghosted or whether he actually wants to try and resolve something. 

I've gotten myself to a point where I was happy being a professional while we were volunteering and having no interaction. Now it feels like he's shaken everything up again and it's just so painful for me.

Can I please get some advice on how to handle this oncoming conversation? And what to do or say? How not to just burst into tears? 

Tldr: guy I was dating needed 2 weeks to decide if he wanted a relationship. He ghosted. After seeing me again he is wanting to talk to me as we had a ""misunderstanding"". Idk what to do.",1,1757473248.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

The teacher that I usually have (24m) is gone this week, so he set me up with another instructor(27m). The first lesson we had together was perfectly normal but then it got slightly weird at the end, but only slightly. He just said that I looked like this female actor and then made comments about how polite I am and that I would be popular in [input foreign country](where he is from). He ended our lesson by saying he would give me a free lesson tomorrow(now today). This was actually when I first started to get a little uncomfortable but now I’m feeling a lot more worried and confused after spending time with him today. So today, I expected to only spend time in his (shared) office as he was teaching me. Except, he asks me if I want to go get coffee with him instead. I regret being such a dense pushover, but I say okay. He drives us there and pays for my drink. I make my way back to the car but then he stops he and is like “why don’t we sit down for a little while” and gives me the option of inside the car or at a table outside. I chose to sit outside and so we talk for a little while, not really about the lesson but more personal. While we’re talking he keeps on making comments about how he finds me pretty and keeps inviting me out to eat with him (and other people?). And at one point he laughs and slightly touches my knee. I’m not trying to say you can’t have fun at work and always have to be professional, but this situation made me uncomfortable. But it could have been because he is not from here and does not speak English fluently, so there was just a cultural difference idk. When we make it back to the school, he’s more professional and teaches for about 1.5-2 hours on the appropriate topic. Until, once he’s finished the lesson, he tells me since he’s doing this lesson for free and usually charges his other students, I have to keep quiet about this and then he’ll continue to give me free lessons (but I was always okay with paying for lessons, also I need to keep track of how many lessons I’m taught so I can prove I’m learning). We walk upstairs to the shared office and he back to talking casually but still feeling slightly inappropriately. And then he says the reason he’s especially tripping over his words today was because he is “nervous in front of a pretty girl” (which is when I knew that something wrong was going on). I can’t remember if I ignored him and slightly laughed at what he said, but I try to leave by saying I need to go soon because I have plans. He tells me to stay and play with him. LUCKILY, two guys walk in and I could immediately see his eyes dart at them. He finally accepts that I have to leave, but says he’ll wake me outside );. But by this time I feel it in my stomach that I need to leave so as soon as we get outside I say thank you and goodbye. I’m supposed to see him again tomorrow morning for another (paid) lesson and really don’t want to. This whole situation feels really uncomfortable and inappropriate. I feel like I’m deceiving the other people at the school just from today’s free lesson. I tried get emergency counseling at my college but it was after hours by the time I called and only a nurse was available. I don’t want to ask my family for advice because they’re hours away and I don’t want them to worry about me. Please help. I posted in another community but I feel like I’m running out of time.

1nd2zvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1nd2zvq/i_have_hit_the_migraine_lottery/,i have hit the migraine lottery,"recently, i got a new “adult” job. i recently a few weeks ago had a pretty not great ajovy reaction and was sick for a few days before starting my new job. in this sickness, all i could think about was oh god my new job. i dont want to be “the girl with migraines who cals out too much” especially since this is my first job after graduation. 

i have spent the last 6 years at a certain mermaid themed green coffee shop and in my last 2 years there (my peak of migraines) have had nothing but poor treatment. i was written up Twice for “attendance” which was 3 times in 2 months for calling out. Then, right before I quit for my new job I was threatened AGAIN to be written up, which would’ve probably cost me my job.

please understand, i have had migraines for years. They’re chronic. they don’t stop. I take my meds and I show up,and do my best, but once they make me throw up, I’m not showing up or i’m leaving. the job is so hard on the body as is and add in a migraine, dizziness, etc i just couldn’t do it. i know i don’t have to explain myself to you all you get it. 

it didn’t matter what i did they did not care, i had countless conversations explaining my migraines to my managers, explaining my treatments, explaining my symptoms, explaining everything I could. No one cared. I got written up, I was tired of it because I understood I couldn’t keep calling out and I also couldn’t stop my migraines. I started looking for a new job and I found that job. 

I’ve been at my new job for a week now. a real 9-5 office job, it’s just what I wanted, but when that Ajovy experience happened I was so worried about showing up and getting in trouble etc. 

I knew yesterday that my migraine was coming, I was hoping it wouldn’t. But it did, so I silently at my desk took my triptan, heated up my neck wrap in the microwave, and went on with my work. I told one of my coworkers and just tried to get through it. 

my manager stoped by my desk and asked if everything was okay, if I was feeling okay because I had my neck wrap on. She has already been the kindest person ever so i told her “oh yeah, just a migraine but i’m okay” and i expected a sort of “oh man bummer” or “oh a HEADACHE got it” as i had been used to (which would be a step up from my manager ignoring me lol) you won’t believe it. she jumped into action and said “I get migraines too! I totally get it I am so sorry, do you want me to heat this up for you again? do you need an ice pack? i have a liquid IV you can have? do you need to go home early? it’s okay if you do” 

when i tell you i almost burst into tears. I knew she really understood when she told me about using Migrainebuddy, I was like wow you DO get this. 

I was so elated and also it feels bittersweet that she understands because she is the nicest person ever and I genuinely wouldn’t wish a migraine on anyone lol. but wow, so relieving.

The teacher that I usually have (24m) is gone this week, so he set me up with another instructor(27m). The first lesson we had together was perfectly normal but then it got slightly weird at the end, but only slightly. He just said that I looked like this female actor and then made comments about how polite I am and that I would be popular in [input foreign country](where he is from). He ended our lesson by saying he would give me a free lesson tomorrow(now today). This was actually when I first started to get a little uncomfortable but now I’m feeling a lot more worried and confused after spending time with him today. So today, I expected to only spend time in his (shared) office as he was teaching me. Except, he asks me if I want to go get coffee with him instead. I regret being such a dense pushover, but I say okay. He drives us there and pays for my drink. I make my way back to the car but then he stops he and is like “why don’t we sit down for a little while” and gives me the option of inside the car or at a table outside. I chose to sit outside and so we talk for a little while, not really about the lesson but more personal. While we’re talking he keeps on making comments about how he finds me pretty and keeps inviting me out to eat with him (and other people?). And at one point he laughs and slightly touches my knee. I’m not trying to say you can’t have fun at work and always have to be professional, but this situation made me uncomfortable. But it could have been because he is not from here and does not speak English fluently, so there was just a cultural difference idk. When we make it back to the school, he’s more professional and teaches for about 1.5-2 hours on the appropriate topic. Until, once he’s finished the lesson, he tells me since he’s doing this lesson for free and usually charges his other students, I have to keep quiet about this and then he’ll continue to give me free lessons (but I was always okay with paying for lessons, also I need to keep track of how many lessons I’m taught so I can prove I’m learning). We walk upstairs to the shared office and he back to talking casually but still feeling slightly inappropriately. And then he says the reason he’s especially tripping over his words today was because he is “nervous in front of a pretty girl” (which is when I knew that something wrong was going on). I can’t remember if I ignored him and slightly laughed at what he said, but I try to leave by saying I need to go soon because I have plans. He tells me to stay and play with him. LUCKILY, two guys walk in and I could immediately see his eyes dart at them. He finally accepts that I have to leave, but says he’ll wake me outside );. But by this time I feel it in my stomach that I need to leave so as soon as we get outside I say thank you and goodbye. I’m supposed to see him again tomorrow morning for another (paid) lesson and really don’t want to. This whole situation feels really uncomfortable and inappropriate. I feel like I’m deceiving the other people at the school just from today’s free lesson.

1nd2tf9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nd2tf9,Full circle,"Photos in Reverse chronological order. My hair’s back after a daunting journey. I consider myself incredibly lucky to be where I am today. 

It started off in May with a patch of hair missing on the right of my head, about the size of a golf ball. I buzzed my hair almost immediately after I noticed, and it just kept getting worse. I was devastated, and incredibly stressed. I remember shaving my head bald for the first time, crying while I ran the razor across my scalp. 

The first few weeks were hard, I hid indoors and felt ashamed everytime I walked outside. Going to school was tough, I hid from the sun all summer. Finally I went to the hospital for blood work, and a referral to the dermatologist. 

At the time I was smoking a lot of weed and tobacco (poppers for those who are familiar with the term) and barely eating. My stress levels were constantly high.

I smashed my bong, and started trying to reduce how much I smoked. I starting drinking kombucha in hopes that it would help my gut recover from the constant fast food, coffee, and cigarette smoking that was making my stomach ache. 

The shedding continued getting worse, I was resigned to the fact that this was how life was going to be and did all I could to accept it, focusing on the positive traits of my personality and character and trying not to think about my looks. 

Still, there were habits that made my stomach sink, like going to run my hand through my hair, shaking the water out of my hair after a shower, feeling the wind in my hair. Each one of these was a subconscious habit that reminded me of the trouble I was going through. 

Each time I shaved my head, I would pray it would maybe grow back, but the smooth spots kept expanding until I had about 50% of my hair left.

I kept reducing how much I smoked, kept trying to transform my habits, kept applying for jobs and pushing to live life normally. I cleaned my room and washed bed sheets I’d been neglecting out of depression and kept pushing forward. I cut gluten out of my diet in case that might be the cause.

When I went to see the dermatologist, they said it could be a thyroid issue, and to get blood work done (I still haven’t) and recommended different treatments (fin/min) and jam inhibitors should the lesser options fail.

Resigned to the fact that I’d be dependant on medication to maintain my hair, I declined the treatment, to which the doctor said “hey, it’s your hair..” (which is a fair reaction)

I kept going about my life, trying to get out in the sun to get my vitamin D up, staying active and trying to eat better. I started to see faint regrowth starting where my hair first fell out, despite the fact that my hair was still shedding. Still, found myself deeply depressed, and decided to start self medicating with magic mushrooms. 

I dosed every night for 5 days straight, I don’t know why I chose to do this, maybe to try and reset my brain subconsciously after reading about the rewiring effects it has on the brain. It was 5 days of hellish anxiety and bad trips, but I kept hammering away at the bag until they ran out. 

After that, I quit smoking weed entirely (14 days sober so far) and quit smoking cigarettes but kept vaping. 

The regrowth continued, and I kept eating better, focusing on hormone stabilizing foods and adequate sleep. It’s been three weeks since those trips, and my hair is almost completely back, still thinner where it once was bald, but growing back stronger than I ever imagined it could. 

It made me wonder about the immune regulating properties of mushrooms, but I believe the regrowth happened before then, and it’s just coincidence. 

Now, there’s just a grey patch where the first hair loss occurred. I’m using rosemary oil, enjoying my meal prep, and looking forward to being able to get a haircut again one day. The whole process was a mindfuck, so to anyone going through it, I hope my story can help in some way. Stay healthy, and hold onto hope.

Did you seriously believe that everything would follow the script. We would have a peaceful prostest, the government would resign and we would all go home eat our daal bhat and sleep. Did you think all the parties with ulterior motives would stay on the side, clap their hands and praise you. Politics is a dirty game, its all about changing the narrative to suit your interests using opportunities to further your goals and backstabbing your oppositions and friends. 

Take a moment to think. Do you think if everybody peacefully protested, shouted our slogans and held our banners on street corners the government would have resigned?? Things got out of hand, some elements used the opportunity to bring destruction and chaos to further their goals. Do not blame yourself for it. Your heart is pure and you stepped into the field with an idealistic dream and love for your country. 

Things got out of hand would be the understatement of the year. Destruction to public properties, loss of lives that will take us years to recover. 

But before you lament, congragulate yourself. You have done something, bigger and more powerful countries have failed to do. You toppled a corrupt government in 28 hours.

I did not encounter any bugs that hindered my gameplay or where visually immersion breaking. The only thing negative that I have to say from the playthrough isn't really negative and I in fact expected it. I would drop frames at times when I had all of my machinery (which was centrally located at one spot on that map for the most part) running in late game or when I went to place a large blueprint that I had devised. Again I expected this and It caused me zero trouble.

The game does a great job of not bogging you down with exploration and survival, which was a fear I had going in, and makes it to where you only really need to explore if you want too. The focus was on the mission and your ability to create an efficient factory, it's simple and concise design and I really like that game philosophy here. They could have easily made a food and water system and I'm glad they didn't do it.

I'm also surprised that only 4.6% of players have beaten the game on steam, makes me feel pretty good. (NOTE THIS IS SINCE 1.0 RELEASE ADDED ACHIEVEMENTS - u/Ricky_Ventura)

The game was never overly complicated which was also refreshing. The stages of the space elevator phases added just enough new content to not overwhelm me and also just enough of a reward in new tech to make it feel rewarding.

I also am particularly proud of my factory design philosophy of triple verticality. I have no idea if it is unoriginal or not, but I figured with there being three outputs on splitters that most machines could be build in three stacks on top of each other, linked by a splitter and conveyor lifts and subsequently by a merger into a storage. This allowed for triple production of a resource or item with only one line in and out. I included plenty of examples in the screenshots above. I made this same design for every machine type except for manufacturers (which I did the triple system still but did them horizontally since 4 input machines stacked would get very messy) and large machines like particle accelerator and such.

I also want to commend the game for having a concise ending. I feel like so many games I play these days just seem to drag on through live service models or New Game plus mechanics. This game simply ends when you are done and it just feels... well.... SATISFYING :)

Cheers to Coffee Stain Studios for a top notch game and I look forward to surfing the sub to see how much better you all are at production planning and design than I am!",13,1757471510.0,SatisfactoryGame,4,1.0,False

Monkey Duo: Yue Xing and Heiyue
Alias/Nicknames: CoffeeCake, Sunflower
Name: Yue Xing
Occupation: Baker/Server
Weapon: Three Section Staff
Powers: Cloning, Transformation, super Strength, Basically Wukong but not as strong.
Having grown up in the serene, magical halls of the Celestial Palace, Yue Xing is naturally graceful and polite, but Earth life has brought out his curiosity, adaptability, and streak of playful mischief. He has a small bit of disdain for the father he's never met, but hides it under a cheerful, sometimes cheeky demeanor. He struggles a bit with earthly social norms and slang, which can lead to charming misunderstandings... or well-placed sass.
Notable Quirks:
Still uses Moon Palace etiquette in casual settings (bows to shop customers, addresses friends like nobles). Keeps a hidden journal of everything he remembers about the Moon and notes on rumors about Sun Wukong.
——————————-
Alias: Lunar Monkey, Moonflower, Little Shadow Name: Heiyue
Occupation: Pastry Chef
Weapon: Guandao
Powers: Shadow manipulation, Shadow Step, Shadow Clones, Lunar Endurance, Enhanced Agility and Stealth Grounded, observant, and a little sharper-tongued than his brother, Heiyue has a knack for reading people quickly - a trait clearly inherited from Macaque. He has an easy bond with his father and often trains with him, giving him confidence in his abilities. However, his closeness with Macaque sometimes makes him overly protective of Yue Xing, especially when he sees how much the absent Wukong still affects his half-brother.
While more pragmatic than Yue Xing, he shares his sense of humor and will join in on harmless pranks (and sometimes escalate them).
Notable Quirks:
Has a habit of appearing silently right behind people mid-conversation. Collects small, polished stones from places he visits and keeps them in a box under his bed. Often acts as Yue Xing's ""translator"" when his brother's moon-born habits confuse Earth locals.",5,1757471312.0,MonkieKid,0,1.0,False

This post covers incredibly personal material and because of that I wanted to post anonymously but honestly - at this point there's nothing I'm going to say here that I haven't already discussed with him in person and we've gotten nowhere. TLDR at bottom. I will be the first to say that I'm not perfect. I'm not a perfect person, or a perfect spouse, I can be lazy at times, I have a tendency to get upset tans keep it to myself but I'm trying hard to changes that actively, I struggle with depression and anxiety and self-harm tendencies, I withdraw at times but I still try to be communicative as to what's going on - I try every day that my eyes open to be the best I can be for him and everyone around me and I'm tired of feeling lucky to be loved. Tired of accepting what I'm now realizing isn't even the bare minimum because I'm blinded by a future that I can't see anymore with a person I feel like I don't even know. I'm so torn and upset because this is a good human being, a sweet, kind, caring and loving man and I want more than anything else in this world for that to be enough. I can feel myself closing in, feel the walls going up, feel myself falling out of love and it's terrifying and I don't know how to fix it. 

Not any one thing led to this point, it's a collection of things big and small and I think part of the reason it's eating me up so bad is because I've tried so hard. I've done my best to grow as a person and step outside of my comfort zone and be communicative, I've initiated talks and discussions over these issues, even made tangible goals to hit to make sure things would actually change, and still nothing *has* changed. I have legitimately told him to his face that we no longer feel like a relationship but like roommates, and bad ones at that, because I support our household and him almost completely on my own, even though it means that I often go without. He has to be to work earlier than me, but I normally wake up first, I handle the househoId morning routine, walking our dogs, scooping the litterbox, watering the plants, taking out trash, if our SCHEDULED pest control is coming I'm normally the one that deep cleans the house, and wrangles all of the animals but recently I have been demanding help with that - all while making my coffee, and getting ready for work, meanwhile he gets up and ready and out the door in 10-15 minutes and is gone. I've asked for help in the mornings and he will help for a few weeks and then it goes back to normal. I work a full-time physically demanding job 36-40ish hours a week, run my own business out of our home on top of that and have at least 2 side hustles going at any time. He has a part-time job at a fast food restaurant where he gets free meals and 2 side hustles working in the art industry and all 3 of those added together make less than my main job. He's supposed to be in charge of buying groceries but he doesn't buy groceries for *us* he buys groceries for *dinner* and snacks which means that any meal outside of that I must provide for myself - which is fine, I'm an adult and can feed myself, or at least it would be if I had any money left over after paying our bills to buy food for myself.

There are many days that I get home and I am too tired and too drained to cook and he does end up cooking most nights but it doesn't happen until 10pm or later and sometimes we end up just going to sleep - even with help and me asking to eat earlier - so most day I don't eat all day until 11/11:45 pm. I used to order delivery a lot because my life is super busy and I didn't have the ability drive and go get myself food at work due to our family not having a working vehicle and that got expensive very quickly - I'd rather pay rent and have a roof over everyone's head instead of eating at that point. I work too much to not be fueling my body properly like that and my body is literally starting to fall apart at the seems. I've expressed this to him and he has even cried, expressing guilt that he cannot provide the life he says I deserve. 

It isn't about not having money or not providing - it's about sticking together and being there for one another. I don't care if we're dirt poor and struggling but we said we'd struggle together and instead I'm the only one. His car broke down shortly after we moved in together and my car had been struggling for awhile but I was doing my best to keep it running. I was trying to save up for a down payment on a newer car because I've only ever had rust buckets and lemons. I had a solid amount of money saved up, but then one thing after another, and suddenly it was all gone. We had an emergency with one of our dogs, it had an obstruction and needed surgery - i put in almost $1k of my own money. We had to take out a loan and that's when I found out how much debt he's been hiding from me. I never lied to him or hid my college debt - it's a crazy amount and I'll probably never finish paying it off. At this point he'd taken a step back from his main job a little to focus on his dream career and we could afford it atm and I wanted to give him support since he didn't have mich growing up - it was only for a season and that was fine - but that means he had extra funds. He no longer had to pay for things like the Internet, or even groceries really at that point, I even pay our phone bill. With the new loan, his debt was at $15k, the vet bill only being $5k of that, and he had left over credit that WE ended up not using. I say we because HE used it. What on? I don't know. I'd said he didn't have to pay me rent while we paid off the loan because his half of the rent would be almost equal to my half of the loan payment so why not just keep the rent money and use it to pay the loan?  Well - turns out, he wasn't making payments on the loan. Where that extra $600 a month was going - I have no clue. Then he begins to recede from me. Becomes more active in his art community. Stops inviting me to exhibits and cons. I begin to feel resentful and I tell him as much. He says that he didn't realize he could invite his spouse to events, even though everyone else does, and that he didn't want to impose. I buy tickets to an exhibit, and dress really nice and plan on taking him out to dinner afterwards because I know he's nervous and no one ever celebrates him. I get there and he leaves me to go out to dinner with his friends, which is fine, it was a huge success and everyone wanted to celebrate, it was the first time people had come together for jim.like this and I loved it - I was even dressed for the occasion, but he LEFT me there, in the city at night alone, waiting for an uber (I had assumed we'd go somewhere fancy and drink and maybe even hit a club so I didn't drive)- even his friends were inviting me and I had to invite myself and he still said no... It didn't sit right with me... I asked him politely to wait on me for my Uber because I didn't want to be alone and he once again said no, that his friends were carpooling so he needed to leave right then.... I told him I could have bought him and Uber and he said he didn't want me to waste my money when it wasn't necessary. That night I sent him a long message about how I love him, but he's hurt my feelings and all I wanted to do was be there for him. I know I should've waited until he was home to have the conversation but I also knew he'd be drunk when he got home and hungover the next day and that if I didn't say something in the moment I was going to internalize it and keep it to myself and let it fester if I had to wait for two days to talk about it. He apparently got hammered and made an ass out of himself that night, stumbling into the house drunk, talking about how everyone was saying he was plastered but he's sober, slurring his words while at it. I just went to bed. In the morning I told him that I was sorry he was being picked on and that I wish that I had been there so I could've had his back and only then did he apologize for everything. Everything was strained after that, and I noticed he stopped wanting even the intimacy of sitting next to each other on the couch and all  conversation that wasn't necessary stopped. 

Weeks later he asked about opening up the relationship and my heart sank. I'd told him that I was interested in ENM from the beginning, but only after our relationship was as strong and healthy as it could be. After many in depth conversations and lots of education - he has very little experience and only one true relationship before we got together - he thinks ENM might actually be a nice idea eventually. I get hit on a lot and it was pretty obvious from the beginning that it was an issue for him, and after one night in particular he told me that he didn't think he'd be okay with any kind of poly or ENM activity in our relationship for the foreseeable future and I was blindsided but I understood. So when he brings up opening the relationship I ask him why the sudden change, and I think he must have known he couldn't hide it from me because he was honest and told me that he liked someone else. I was devastated. I don't care about the crush - I care about the manipulative, opportunistic behavior. I care about the fact that opening the relationship should've been a conclusion we came to together. I care about the fact that instead of this being about *us* and the strength and happiness of our relationship is was because he fell for someone else. I obviously said no and told him why, expressed that him coming to such an immature conclusion shows me that he may never be ready for us to open the relationship if this is what he thinks it's about.

After that, my trust was shattered. I was no longer attracted to him. In my eyes, you spend most of your time with someone, you cut out your partner from your personal life and replace them, stop working your main job so you can spend more time around this person, and then go as far as to try to include them into your relationship - that's cheating. That's having a wandering eye. That's not just a crush... I've brought this up - it's like he doesn't understand that we don't get to just talk about it and move on, that the trust needs to be built back up.... That was over a year ago. I can count on my hands the amount of times he initiated physical contact before this, it was almost always me and I get it, he was nervous and had little experience but I felt so unwanted...

Then my car broke down and after all this time he's been apparently still not paying his debt or our bills or saving money. I panicked because not having a car affects every aspect of my life, especially my business. We get the car running after a lot of time and money and then he tells me he wants to make his own exhibit. Right off the bat it'll cost him $1000. I was stunned, wondering why he would even tell me since we obviously can't afford it and then he tells me that he CAN afford it if he makes spending changes. The changes? All of the things I've asked him to do so he can afford to help out more at the house. He won't even get a joint bank account with me because he said he's ""scared"" and it feels ""kinda controlling"". He doesn't have $1k when WE need it, when our ANIMALS need it, when we don't have a working vehicle, when we desperately need a new car, when there are days I don't eat so I can afford to pick up food for our pets - half of which are his that he wanted because he's never been allowed to have pets before - that I almost fully support, including food, vet bills, cleaning supplies, litter.

It just feels like he doesn't think or care about me at all anymore, I've asked him not to (even though it broke my heart and I felt like a POS for suggesting it) and he's continuing with his art showing. When my car broke down dead dead he knew I was at my wits end and instead of calling it off he's now sunk $2k additional into the showing. He called his mom sobbing, saying I was going to leave him and she started giving him money that our household *still* didn't see, then got us a car which is - wow, completely amazing and a huge favor, only for me to find out it's because he called her crying, and that now we owe her $7k because she took out a loan to get us the car because now both of our credits are destroyed and we can't get a loan for a down payment... I didn't know OR agree to this and I was shocked when I found out. I knew that it was odd that she got us a car, but I thought she was just helping her son out, not that she's in debt now because of us! She looks at me different now and I didn't understand until his older sister let it slip that their mother had taken out a loan. All I'm asking for us transparency and honesty and I'm not getting it. He still asks me to send him money for Uber or for food delivery, or most recently to get the tags for his car renewed because he's been driving the poor thing on its last leg with tags that are nearly a year out of date. I bought the tags for the new car, that didn't come out of the loan money. I'm so lost. I feel like I'm suffocating. I feel like I'm trapped in a box that keeps getting hotter and smaller and I want to sob and scream and run away and I don't know what to do. I don't know if this can even be rebuilt, restarted, even from the ground up. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, what I'm not saying right because I feel like any normal person would be devastated to hear their wife tell them that they aren't attracted to them anymore, that the relationship feels more like roommates, that they don't trust them, yet here he is, chilling without a care in the world... Even had the audacity to tell me that we'd never be homeless because his Mom would let us live with her. I genuinely almost threw up, it gave me the heebie-jeebies. Remaining unreliable because your mother is your safety net is not an option and I told him as much but still... Nothing has changed. I've had a few toxic relationships, I've experienced abuse in the past, and I often feel guilty because he's never done anything like that, never hurt me or pressured me. He is kind. He is sweet. He is a good person. Just a bad husband, at least at the moment. And I'm at a complete and total loss. I know we're young - and above anything I want this to work, but I also don't want to waste both of our time just to have everything end up staying the same and us separate in ten years after being unhappy for too long.

TLDR:
feel like our relationship has become unbalanced in a way that leaves me carrying most of the financial, emotional, and household responsibilities. He can be very sweet and loving, but also cold or withdrawn, and the inconsistency makes it hard for me to feel safe, supported, or attracted. Broken agreements and lack of follow-through have eroded my trust, and I feel like I sacrifice and adjust far more than he does. Living together has actually increased my load instead of easing it, and I need stability, financial partnership, and consistent emotional presence to possibly build anything back again but I'm at a loss at how to get that from him at this point.",6,1757470807.0,Marriage,8,1.0,False

1nd28mv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1nd28mv/safe_love/,Safe Love,"I want a love that feels warm, cozy, like a little home in the country with the fireplace on. A mug of hot tea or coffee in my lap, a thick blanket around my shoulders.

Where I don't have to earn love or affection, it is freely given because I exist and that is enough. I want a love where I can express my feelings, and they are met with gentleness and understanding. I want someone who listens intently when I speak, because they are genuinely interested in what I have to say. Who is unwavering and almost excessive in their loyalty, not just the appearance of it, but the practice of it. Who is honest to a fault. 

Someone who holds me when I'm upset without trying to fix anything. Who is a person of their word, and shows up when they say they will. Who takes their time getting to know the ins and outs of my soul, who loves me the way *I* want to be loved, and not just in the way that's easiest for them.  Someone who is always taking me into consideration. Who is patient, and gentle, and knows the art of restraint and tact. Who knows reciprocity is important to me, and that there's nothing I ask for I'm not more than willing to give back. Someone who doesn't try to avoid conflict, but sees it as an opportunity to build a new bridge of understanding between each other. Someone who doesn't run. 

I made the mistake of thinking this was you. When I miss you, I am starkly reminded of the fact that I only miss the You from the first few months of our relationship. I was naive and *told* you this is what I was looking for, so of course you did the easy thing: you talked. You said you would love me in all these ways. You're damn good with words too, a real poet. So I fell in love with the promises. Who wouldn't? But in the years that followed, when it came to the actual *practice* of loving me, you were the exact opposite of my safe and cozy love. 

You ran when things were hard, ignored me when I cried, refused to ever reassure me. Got bored and distracted when I'd excitedly tell you a story. You'd lie, for seemingly no reason at all aside from just wanting to and seeing if you could get away with it. You never followed through or stuck to your word. Your heart wandered, though you'd never admit it to me. You didn't consider how your big life decisions would impact me. You punished me for disagreeing with you about anything, even the most trivial of things. Did you love me, or did you love having an NPC girlfriend around?

So please, don't get it twisted. When you see my letters on here, and some of them are about missing you, they're not really about *you.* They're about missing the love I imagined, the love I've dreamed of since I was little. The love that's always been just out of reach. You'd think this would make me desperate, but it just hardens my resolve to not settle for even a drop less. You are not the man I thought you were, and whenever I make a little progress in accepting that difficult fact, I successfully let you go a little bit more.

Which will eventually clear the way for my real Safe Love to come into my life. I want to be ready for him, to be able to give back all I receive and more.

Hey there everyone! I’m 31, looking for that long term friend I’ve been waiting for. I’m pretty chill, no drama, not looking for anything weird either. Recently got back into gaming. I’m on PC and enjoy a little bit of everything. Currently messing around on Once Human. 

I have 2 dogs, so swapping pet pics would be awesome! I’m big into outdoorsy adventures. I do a lot of camping and hiking.

If I’m not at work, I’m lying, because I’m basically always at work. 

Anyways, hit me up if you wanna chat or play something! Or neither! Or both! What’s the worst that could happen? ",1,1757470490.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False
