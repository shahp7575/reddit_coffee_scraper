He is stage 4 mets to the liver. Got the diagnosis right before Valentine’s Day. I look at the dying chart everyday to get some idea, but he has stayed in the days not weeks column for a couple of weeks. He appears to be in a ton of pain, and I just don’t want him to suffer anymore. He has in home hospice now, and is taking morphine for pain. The hospice nurse isn’t giving a timeline. Gonna tell you his current symptoms and maybe someone can give me a better idea. 

Symptoms:
Jaundiced
Lost probably 40 pounds. Went from about 185 to 140ish. 
Cool hands
Tries to get up in the middle of the night, but keeps falling. 
Extremely weak
Eats a single m&m every other day maybe. Still drinks ginger ale. Hasn’t been eating much of anything else in 4 weeks. 
Started throwing up bile last night. My stepmom said it was dark green. I visited him today and he threw up a dark brown color, but wasn’t coffee ground like. 
A lot of confusion and seems like sound and visual hallucinations
Still drinks water but maybe no more than 12 ounces a day. Urinating in an adult diaper. 
Sleeps a lot during the day and is restless at night
He can’t talk much and just mumbles a lot
As of Wednesday the nurse said his vitals were still good. 
Lots of twitching
Hiccups that really hurt him

These are what I’m seeing. Please help me know how long he has. It’s sad to say, but I don’t want him to suffer anymore. 

Thank you all

HARPER’S TRAGEDY
-JAMES HARPER-

In the heart of Foundry Hills, corruption and deceit governed the land. Skyscrapers clawed at the sky, each straining higher for dominance over the concrete jungle. Foundries surrounded the town, expelling thick, toxic plumes that blanketed the population below. Pedestrians rushed along, indifferent to one another, dodging vehicles that tore through intersections with horns blaring, each driver consumed by their own desires. Here, humanity had bartered away its soul for a slim chance at success, with odds near impossible.

To the northwest stood Warren Court, beneath a canopy of dark clouds drifting in from the industrial district. Cloaked in shadow, this neighborhood held a peaceful stillness, untouched by the city’s sins. James Harper’s home was here, filled with memories that served as a rare refuge—a flicker of peace against the chaos taunting its border.

Harper retrieved his glasses from the sink counter, wiping the lenses to restore clarity to his blue-eyed view of the world. Rain hammered against the bathroom windows, its rhythmic pounding a percussion backdrop to the muffled voices drifting in from the hallway.

Suddenly, the house plunged into darkness.

“Harp?” Denise’s voice called from the kitchen.

The lights flickered back on, the outage brief.

“It’s okay, Denise, just another brownout,” Harper called back, his tone reassuring. “I’ll be out in a second.”

It was brief this time, at least, thought Harper. His fingers brushed against a small box as he reached into his hoodie pocket and pulled it out—a delicately wrapped package labeled For my love in elegant, golden script. A smile crept onto his face as he envisioned its contents: a gold necklace with an emerald pendant, chosen to match the sparkle of Denise's eyes, as he so vividly remembered from their first encounter. The emerald, though valuable, couldn’t compare to them. Today was the day he’d gift it—a symbol of the love they'd built over a decade.

Harper felt anxious and excited, picturing Denise's face when she saw it. He tucked the box back into his pocket, a hidden surprise that would be revealed in a couple of hours.

As he walked down the decorated hallway, lined with family photos, a flash of lightning illuminated their faces. Peering through the drapes, he watched the rain swell the nearby creek, spilling over into the garden beds.

Alice and James Jr. looked up as he entered the living room and made his way to the couch, their laughter spilling from the card game they were playing. They were great kids, always looking out for each other—something Harper never had growing up as an only child in a city as unforgiving as this one.

“Mmm, do you smell that, Junior?” Alice asked.

He nodded eagerly. “Yup, our favorite on cold, rainy days—delicious stew.”

The aroma of Denise’s family recipe, a hearty beef stew simmering with herbs and vegetables, filled the house. She covered the pot with a lid, then picked up a bowl of popcorn and joined them in the living room.

“Been your dad’s favorite for years,” she said, smiling down at them. “Isn’t that right, Harp?”

“You know it is,” Harper replied, inhaling the rich, comforting scent. “I don’t know what I’d do without your amazing cooking.”

Her smile widened as she set down the bowl and placed her hand on his. “You’d be living on bland food, missing all the flavor I bring to your life,” she teased, her smile playful.

“I love you, Denise,” he murmured.

“I love you, Harp.”

They snuggled on the couch, listening to Moonlight Sonata drifting from the radio. Their eyes settled above the fireplace, on a photo taken at Rolling Peaks. It was the last family photo they took together, the four of them standing together, smiling in front of blooming red peonies.

Denise rested her head against Harper's chest. He breathed in deeply, catching the soft, floral scent of her red hair. On the tan carpet, Alice and James Jr. lay immersed in their game, their laughter weaving softly through the evening.

Harper felt at peace, his gaze drifting to the flames dancing in the fireplace, casting light and shadows across the room. His eyes closed for a moment—until the crack of gunfire shattered the silence, bullets ripping through the lock. The Harpers all turned toward the front door as splinters flew, a final gunshot blasting it from its hinges. A masked intruder in all black burst through, slamming the door open as the frame buckled under the force.

Two other armed gunmen rushed in behind the intruder, closing in from multiple angles. Harper shot up from the couch, heart pounding and adrenaline surging through him. He pivoted to face the threat as one of the intruders rounded the corner of the couch, weapon raised.

Before he could react, the pistol struck Harper’s temple with a sickening crack, sending him staggering back. He stumbled against the coffee table, then collapsed to his knees on the ground. Pain radiated through his skull, spreading like a thousand knives stabbing every nerve behind his eyes. His vision blurred, and the intruders’ voices began to muffle as the edges of his consciousness slipped—until a scream tore through. Denise, no. I have to get up—now! he thought.

Her voice jolted him back to the scene, his left eye clouded by a thin trickle of blood from a cut above his brow. Harper touched the wound, keeping his one clear eye on the gunmen. Surrounded and outnumbered, he held back, trying to figure out their intentions.

“What do you want?” he demanded.

“Money?” the woman scoffed. “Please, you couldn’t afford anything close to my worth. We’re simply fulfilling his request.” Her voice was chillingly calm as she stood slightly apart from the others, clearly in charge.

“And what is that?” Harper’s fists clenched as he eyed her.

Her gaze drifted toward the window, landing on a photo on the end table. She lifted it, her gloved fingers brushing over the smiling faces. “A shame… such a beautiful family…”

Harper guided Denise and the children behind him, drawing them close as he shielded his family as best he could. James Jr. whimpered, clutching his sister. The coffee table and sofa were all that stood between them and masked intruders, who held their guns pointing to the ground.

The woman’s gaze shifted to Denise, then down to the kids behind her legs. She sighed, setting the photo back on the table, then locked her gaze dead-set into Harper’s blue, desperate eyes. “Kill the Harpers.”

Harper’s eyes dropped to the coffee table. He quickly grabbed the laptop and swung it hard, smacking the intruder across the face, sending him crashing to the floor, unconscious.

Another intruder approached, his weapon in hand but not yet aimed. Before he could raise it, Harper ducked, throwing his weight forward as he grabbed the gunman’s arm, wrestling to keep the barrel pointed away from Denise and the kids, who had shifted toward a corner. The intruder pushed back hard, forcing Harper’s shoulders into the mantel above the lit fireplace, knocking a set of fireplace tools clattering to the ground. Harper groaned, the intense heat from the fireplace searing against his back, making his clothes feel as if they were melting to his skin.

The intruder jerked his arm back, but Harper twisted his wrist, locking him into a firm Jiu-Jitsu hold. He angled the gunman’s arm upward and outward, forcing him into a position where aiming the weapon was impossible. A round fired, missing the coffee table and burying itself in the carpet.

Then, a second gunshot rang out, shattering the framed photo above the mantle inches from Harper’s face and sending glass fragments flying toward him.

They all looked back at the woman, her smoking barrel aimed at Harper.

Denise stepped forward, shoving the woman’s armed hand downward and clawing her nails across her skin, catching the edge of her eye. The woman didn’t flinch but, with a sharp, angry motion, struck Denise on the left side of her head with the butt of the gun.

Denise stumbled back, clutching her head. As she tried to recover, the woman yanked her red hair back, pressing the barrel of the weapon firmly against her temple.

“Enough!” the woman barked, silencing the room. Her free hand brushed the fresh cut near the corner of her eye, smearing the blood as annoyance and a hint of admiration flashed across her face.

“Feisty,” she muttered, pressing the barrel harder. Her lips twisted into a humorless smile. “I can respect that. Still, I pity it won’t save you—or them.”

Harper was too far to intervene, and any sudden move would risk Denise’s life—including his children’s. He forced himself to stay still, but the fury inside made him shake with the urge to explode.

“Put those hands up, now!” she commanded.

Harper raised his hands. “Please, don’t do this. I’ll do whatever you want, just don’t hurt my family.”

“Clearly, you’re hard of hearing. I’ve made our purpose here obvious.” She shot a glance at the assailant next to Harper and gave a nod. “Finish it. And don’t forget to drag that one out,” she added, gesturing dismissively at the unconscious one on the ground.

“Por supuesto,” he said. “Nothing personal, Mr. Harper. Buenas noches.” He drew back and delivered a powerful strike with the butt of his gun to the side of Harper’s head, sending him crumpling to the floor and into a deep, painful unconsciousness.

Gunshots erupted in the room with a deafening roar, blending with the fury of the storm outside, which thundered and rained relentlessly over the community. From the outside, 113 Warren Court seemed peaceful—an unintended illusion that concealed the horror within.

Gunpowder smoke sat heavy in the Harper home, stripping it of its former warmth. Nothing moved except the simmering stew on the stove.

1k9ldem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1k9ldem/im_in_awe_of_the_power_of_lent/,I'm in awe of the power of Lent,"I've given up things for Lent before, but this past Lent was the first time I gave up several things in an effort to really take the practice of self denial seriously. For me this meant giving up alcohol, meat, fancy coffee, snacking, and sugary drinks. I kept life simple, focusing on daily prayer and giving to the poor (working in a city with many impoverished people helped with this one).

After Lent was over and I started to bring those things back into my life, I noticed how quickly the insatiable desire for them came back too. Even just this past week, when I've had a few drinks, or too much to eat, afterwards I've just felt like, ""Why did I do that?"" I can feel the craving for more almost immediately. It's wild to deny yourself for a period of time and then once you get a little bit, the lust for it comes back again so strongly.

I've read many times in Scripture how Jesus is freedom, and I've grasped it intellectually but this is the first time I really understood it viscerally with my body. I remember reading an interview with a monk who said that abstaining from food is the easiest way to train for controlling yourself against harder things you struggle with. I don't know if anyone else has had this experience with Lenten abstinence, but I guess I just want to say, take Lent seriously as an opportunity to simplify and center yourself on living a life pleasing to God. I think even small practices of denying yourself like on Fridays helps with building up your ability to control sinful and un-Christian-like behaviors that get in the way of your relationship with Christ, and I think you can really get to that place much more easily than you would without a regular practice of abstinence. Maybe I'm preaching to the choir, but I hope this helps someone in their journey towards Christ.",1,1745808452.0,Catholicism,0,1.0,False

I recently bought my first home. It’s small and quirky and still a bit of a fixer upper. I have a friend visiting who I love dearly, but somehow always damages things when she visits.

Some examples include:
- Spreading gas throughout the house bc she used the only broken burner I told her not to use (was in the process of fixing it)
- She found and lit my candle I was saving for a special occasion and spilled half the wax all over my coffee table
- She left open raw chicken in my fridge that she spilled all inside it and ruined a bunch of my food (took hours to clean)
- She spilled coffee and grabbed my decorative towels that I collect to wipe it and stained them all when there were paper towels right in front of her
- Borrowed my key and left the door unlocked

I know some of these things sound petty, but I’m young and have scraped and saved for everything. I take really good care of them because I want them to last. None of my other friends do these things so I’m a little lost. I know it’s not intentional bc she treats her own things the same way and she says she wishes she could keep things as nice as mine but doesn’t know how. She’s a great friend and I don’t want to lose that.

So WIBTA if I had a convo about this when she arrives? Or is this just the price of having guests? Any advice on how to broach the convo is also much appreciated!

the soft smile that only you get to see? when you get to hold her in your arms shorter than her torso? and i get to tell her, *remind her*, that i am so damn lucky. and reassure her every damn day that how she exists in the world is absolutely perfect. 

the protectiveness? how she looks out for not just me but other women, how other women *see* her and know exactly who she is. that validity in her existing as herself, is a signal for others, but also for lesbians like me? she's stood in coffee shop in a tank top and low waisted jeans, sunglasses on her forehead and she is so *lesbian*. and other people see it too. other lesbians see it, see *us* and maybe another lesbian can think *hey it's possible for me as well.*

she wears a sports bra and boxers under her scrubs and i know that's when she feels her most confident, most herself. and when i have the privilege of dressing up around her and holding onto her arm. when she *guides* me through the crowd and i have never felt more *femme* in my life than in that moment.

she glares at the instruction manual for the new bedside table we bought and says *don't worry i got it*. her biceps flex and she's sat on the floor and i want to sit on *her*. she is so intelligent. she wants to figure out how things work. masc lesbians *take care* and in turn i want to take care of them, *take care of her.* she somehow knows what i need, always what i need, and it makes *me* need *her* so much more.

masculine lesbians. who are unapologetically lesbian. unapologetically masculine. in a world that doesn't want you to be either and especially, definitely, not both: i love you. we see you and we love you. and there is absolutely going to be a woman out there who appreciates every atom of your entire being.

I know that the coffee grind appearance is normal post-BBL, which I had some of in other areas, but this feels almost like a raised scab. Before the treatment there was barely a spot there at all.

I’ve posted before and after. It is right in the center of my forehead and I’m really hoping it will improve and not look darker/worse than before treatment. Is there hope? Thank you.

1k9l6uq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9l6uq,First tour: New Haven to Provincetown,"Route: We used the East Coast Greenway (ECG) and Ride with GPS heatmaps to plan the route. We followed ECG for the most part with some detours to avoid unpaved trails. It was a nice mix of mixed-use trails and quieter roads, with the occasional higher traffic road (the ECG map indicates “high-stress” sections). Crossing the Sagamore Bridge was the worst part. We split the route into 6 days of riding and 2 rest days in Providence. Full ride data here: https://ridewithgps.com/trips/272755596?privacy_code=Mcoad7j6P25hwZoa89ulti8YSumREx5f 

Bikes and gear: My partner and I both bought our C lines for commuting in NYC, but we were inspired by other Brompton tourers to try a longer trip. I switched out the stock 50T chainring for 44T for easier climbing, though we still found anything above a 10% grade pretty hard. Thankfully we didn’t get any flats or other mechanical issues. We went credit card-style and stayed at motels + BNB’s, so we just carried the essentials with some room for groceries. For the bus plus train trip back to NYC, we packed the bikes in Dimpa bags with some cardboard and bubble wrap that we bought at our destination.

Some highlights:
- Quiet country roads in Connecticut leading to and from Willimantic, and the forested roads crossing into Coventry, RI
- Waterfront views throughout Cape Cod, and beach views from Wellfleet
- Favorite coffee stops: Story and Soil (Hartford), Nitro Bar (Providence), Snowy Owl (Sandwich)
- Sweet bread french toast at Al Mac’s Diner in Fall River

Where we are at so far:

*Cold brews and cold shoulders*

Since the fateful day when I  refused to fund another artisanal caramel smuzzle-fruzzle drink, things between me and Iced Caramel Macchiato have... shifted.
No more 1-on-1 coffee strolls bright an early. Only group coffee runs now, where she miraculously orders a normal drink like everyone else. Small victories make the days go by.

That said, I do detect a slight coolness in her attitude. Maybe it’s just my paranoia. Maybe it’s the caffeine withdrawals hitting her harder now. Who’s to say?

Interestingly enough, heard whispers a while back from another colleague claiming he got scammed into buying an overpriced drink recently... No names mentioned, but cmonnnnn....

*Announcement day*

Big company news dropped earlier than expected:
They officially announced that my manager is leaving in June — and yours truly is stepping into the big boy chair.

Most of the team has actually been really lovely — people coming up all morning, offering congratulations, a few even joking that finally someone who will be in the office more than 10 mins a month.

As for Iced Caramel Macchiato?
Not a peep.
Not a word.
Not even a slurp of the straw.

Yes, a few awkward glances across the room though — like she’s trying to gauge if she should say something, or if she'll get invoiced $18 per compliment (I may be considering it)

*Team morale initiatives*

Now, naturally, as a soon-to-be leader of the people, I’m thinking of creative ways to foster positive workplace culture. I have been watching Dwight Schrute Manager compilation clips non stop,  all morning.

One idea:
A ""Team Coffee Etiquette"" poster — gentle reminders about buying reasonable coffees when it's someone else's shout. You know, promoting healthy habits, financial wellness, mental well-being, basic human decency. I wont mention any names.

Is that cheeky? Is it petty? Im opening the floor for this one.
But what’s leadership without a little bit of reform?

Stay tuned..... I might just become the first manager to implement a Fair Trade Coffee-Shout Agreement.

Caught up with some old friends, 
made a few new ones along the way.

Here’s a glimpse at the rotation
 I enjoyed over the weekend.

Sampled over 300 coffee this weekend at the expo. Had to take the edge off with a different kind of rotation.

 • Double Eagle Rare (killed the bottle)
 • Yamazaki 25 Year
 • Hibiki 30 Year
 • Octomore 13.3
 • Pappy (killed the bottle)

& many cocktails 🍹 🍷

Mystery Packs are launching this week!
Moving to different packaging, testing new rebranding/packaging.
(See the previous post for details.)

Subscription orders will start shipping this weekend and into the first of the month. Fresh coffee is landing throughout the week! I’m pushing hard to get everything out ASAP. Basically have 2/4 coffee on hand. Just waiting for things to arrive before we can shop. Tentative target date is first week of May.

We’re also adding a ton of new coffee,
going harder than anyone’s ever gone before.

My new timeline is order coffee at the beginning of the month from international roasters. Takes about 2 weeks to arrive, pack 1 week, and have ready to ship by EOM.
 
The vision: 20+ roasters per drop, with 7–15 of their absolute best coffees each.

Still fine tuning some storage protocols, but we’re moving toward vacuum sealed, cold storage in the near future. Just need to upgrade the hardware to make it happen.

Big moves incoming with Zero Fucks given.

So, the girl I slept with and I eventually settled on being friends because there was a distance between us. We are now best friends, and it will always be that way.

Now, about 1 year 1/2 ago, I met a girl at campus who is very nice, sweet, and caring. However, she is 21 years old and lives with her parents, who are very religious (the girl is not religious). They control her life. So, back in August, the girl ghosts me out of nowhere. I was very confused. We never talked about anything sexual, never kissed, etc. but we did go to an amusement park together.

I know 30 and 21 is a pretty big difference, but it’s normal for me because my mom is almost 10 years older than my dad, and my sister-in-law is 8 years older than my brother.

After about 2 months of not hearing anything and me not texting her at all, she texts me and apologizes, says her parents found out about my age and made her cut contact (they threaten to kick her out). She says she understands if I don’t want to respond and she felt terrible about ghosting me in the first place.

So, we start occasionally getting coffee together every couple weeks while texting daily.

On Friday, I had this girl come over to my place for the 2nd time. I finally talked to her about how difficult her parents would be if we wanted to date, but asked her if she was interested in being more than friends, possibly hooking up. She responded VERY positively, said she’d love that and started saying she needs to find an excuse to get out of her house for the summer so we can be together.

I kiss her goodbye, she goes home, I text her later that night and she says everything was cool when she got home but her GRANDFATHER saw us getting coffee and may tell her parents.

The next morning, I asked her if she’s sure I didn’t just make her uncomfortable, and she said she “definitely did not feel uncomfortable at all” and that I’m totally good. But now she’s not read any messages since yesterday morning.

SO, either her parents found out again and took her phone like she’s a teenager, OR she made up the grandfather story to stop talking to me. 

Thing is, she reacted happily through our conversation in person, and was happy when she left, plus responded the next morning to say I didn’t make her uncomfortable.

So now, do I believe that her parents are this controlling? Could she have gotten freaked out?

Like I said, I know there’s an age gap and this girl was pretty sheltered through life, but it was so refreshing being treated so kindly for once, and we have a surprising amount of hobbies and common interests. I also don’t meet people very often, and was surprised at how great of chemistry we were starting to have. It felt very natural and like it was going somewhere.

What do I do next? Assume she had to stop texting bc of her parents and wait for her to text me? I would really like to figure out a way to contact her and find out for sure if it’s something I did, or if her parents are really this insane. But, I am not gonna stalk someone either, so like where is the middle ground? Is there a “next move” other than waiting for a potential text in the future? I definitely don’t get the sense that I freaked her out based on her positive reaction to my suggestion. If anything, it felt like she was waiting for me to make a move. Now I don’t have a clue what to think, and the anxiety is driving me nuts.

For some background info, I’m 24F, my husband is 27M and we have two kids, 1F and 3M. Please no foul comments, yes I am aware I had children young etc and it was not a good decision. I am actively looking for ways to better their lives and they are well taken care of. 

I met my partner 7 years ago, and we were on and off until I got pregnant with my son. 

My partner has various issues. He’s a heavy drinker, yellowing eyes, exhaustion, weight loss etc. He never leaves the house, never gets home from work at the restaurant until after 1 am, in any argument has smashed my glass coffee table shattering it, tore up my favorite sweatpants while I was still wearing them looking for my phone, punched a hole in the wall, all of the screens off the windows and constantly threatens to end his life if I ever leave him. This happens when he is intoxicated and I express I don’t like his behavior. Thankfully the kids haven’t been present for this. 

To his friends and coworkers, he’s the coolest guy. He treats his girl-friends wonderfully and I honestly have no idea why he acts like this around just me. I try to be the best partner I can for him, I cook clean etc go to work full time and take care of children. Recently I have been getting more and more distant from him, his behaviors to me are become less and less tolerable and I am starting to feel the gravity of the situation. He never has shared me online, hates to go out with me to social gatherings with friends (he will lie where he is before telling me anything) etc. I can admit I am not the best at reacting and sometimes he makes me feel like it’s my fault since he is nice to everyone else but me. It really hurts. 
Is this unacceptable? Is this abusive? I come from a horrible family environment myself so I’m not quite sure if it’s my fault or not. 
I work full time but would not make enough to keep my current living situation and I can’t even fathom what he would do or lengths he would go to to make my life hell if I leave. I feel stuck. He has threatened killing himself or any future boyfriends I may have if I ever leave with a machete. 
Sometimes the line between normal and not is blurred for me, and would like some outside support advice and opinion. ",1,1745807041.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

I male \[24\] are in a situationship that's fucking with my mental health so bad because of other deeply rooted issues I have not worked through yet.

I was in a 4-year relationship with my ex, but things started to take a turn around October of last year. I was falling out of love with her because I was unsatisfied with the 20% I was fixated on. In hindsight I could have done a better job at communicating and doing more myself, but she did things that made me start looking at the 20%. 1. She was very insecure, 2. She did not take job opportunities that I gave her, 3. Sexually the intimacy became less and less on both our parts. Little things started to add up on both sides that caused a rift. I eventually made the decision to break up with her in February because it came to its finale. It wasn't a good breakup, but we have since made up and talked it out and forgave each other. She is still my best friend, and we still talk but don't have any intention to get back together anytime soon. We were highly compatible, just not ready yet. She was my first love and I'm glad she was. I was her third boyfriend.

Around October we got a new batch of workers at the place I work, and I was training some of them. One of them was another woman who is the same age as me. We can call her Amber \[24\]. Amber is super attractive totally my type physically. I was still with my ex at the time but was always faithful to her. I had approached Amber and introduced myself to her and offered to train her/help her out with any questions work related. (Something I never do is introduce myself to women let alone go out of my way to do so). She was very sweet and friendly at the time and had me write my number down in her notebook since she didn't have a phone at the time. As the months would go on, I saw her around more often especially down where I work, and we would briefly chat about work and simple things like her hair or how the weekend was for us. Nothing ever lasted more than 5-10 minutes. Sometimes a simple hi and bye. However, I noticed in one particular conversation she had stopped me by the elevators and asked me to help her check her hours on the system. While talking to her, she is smiling intently at me, batting her eyes, playing with her hair, and even being somewhat playful in the conversation. She knew I was taken because somehow it made its way in the conversation and previous ones. But I started to feel that this girl Amber had a crush on me. And I was right or at least I thought so.

Fast forward to February, I run into a mutual friend/coworker of Amber's and I in the hallway. We can call her Joan \[35\]. Joan stopped me in the hallway and out of nowhere asked how things were going with my ex. I responded that it ok, but that we are going through some stuff. She then said, ""Oh okay, I can't tell you anything then."" I just laughed and said, ""What I got a secret admirer?"" She nodded yes and said so. Thats when the fucking gears in my head started to turn because earlier that day Joan and Amber came down to where I worked hours earlier and Joan said, ""Hey, don't you think my friend Amber looks cute?"" I said, ""Yeah, I like her hair too, but I think I think Josh looks cuter (Josh is a random male coworker that was working with me at the time). They just laughed, and I quickly walked away not thinking much of it. But, after Joan had told me that upstairs, I immediately got flustered and left. I called another mutual friend of mine and Amber's up to get his opinion. We can call him Henry \[41\]. Henry has given her rides home because he and her live in the same direction. He told me that one night Amber started talking about me and said that ""Your boy \[my name\] can get it"". This was apparently back in October which is when we first started being introduced through small run ins at our job. I was like holy fuck this is tight. But then, I started thinking about my ex and was like nah I can't do that no matter how much we are struggling right now. 15 minutes after Henry and I had that conversation Amber texts me out of nowhere, I did not have her number, but she had mine since October. She came hot and heavy out the gates calling me cute and that she's been looking for me all day and that she wants my help with ""something"". She sent me a photo of herself in the elevator nothing lewd but asks for one back of me. (So, I send one). She starts again with the compliments, and I call her cute as well. Shortly after meeting up with her, we get to talking and she's sharing stuff about her to me. She tells me she has a kid, that she rents an apartment alone with her mom and sister and tells me some personal details about the sister she lost a few years back. So naturally I share stuff about myself back. But as the hour approaches, she tells me that she knows I have a girlfriend, and she is going to respectfully take a step back and that she just wanted to tell me how she felt. I was thankful that she did that, and I told her that I am flattered but that I want to keep my peace and not complicate things.

  
Needless to say, I sat with this for a couple days. I decided to break things off with my ex and I won't lie. A big reason was because of Amber. I wanted to pursue someone new and try new pussy. Yeah, I was unhappy and so was my ex. It would have gotten worst and reached a new boiling point at some time in the near future. So, I said fuck it. Little did I know how much I was going to be hurting despite me doing the breaking up. My ex ended moving back home and I approached Amber a week later and told her what transpired. I was honest with her. I told her, ""I like you, I am attracted to you, and I want to pursue you. But I also want to be truthful with you. I just got out of a 4-year relationship and I'm hurting. I don't want us to move fast, and I don't want to use you as a rebound. I want to build up a friendship with you first. We both work here and the last thing I want is for us not to work out and make things uncomfortable and disrupt each other's peace. We both have a lot going on and you have a child to take care of. With that being said, I would like for us to make time for each other and spend time together outside of work when we can. I want to get to know you and build up something up with you. I don't play with people's emotions because people can get hurt badly that way."" She agreed and told me that I need to heal first and that she'll be there for me. She continued to love-bomb me and follow me at work to the point where other coworkers started noticing it and even a manager called it out by calling us ""love birds"".  Naturally, she was making me feel good while I was hurting, I didn't really fully process the breakup yet. She would call me almost every morning, leave me hearts in the messages and text me consistently for weeks. But out of nowhere she pulled back suddenly. Calls became less frequent to now none, text messages became hours apart sometimes never responding back. This made me spiral in my head thinking ""Was this a game to her?"" I thought we were on the same page. She told me she hasn't dated in 3 years. That she has only had 3 relationships (all of which ended with her being cheated on). She told me she valued consistency and honesty. That communication was not her strong suit and that she hates texting and would rather call. I would ask her out for coffee, or dinner, or even a hike since she told me she likes the outdoors. Not once have we hung out since February. I took it as her being busy since she's a mom and the only breadwinner in her household. But I would sometimes see her stories on IG, and she would be out with friends or chilling at home. Not just that, but as texts became less frequent and response times super long, we would take lunch together and she would be glued to her phone while I'm trying to talk with her. Calling people, texting people back and looking at memes. Mutual friends/co-workers would tell that she really likes me and cares for me. That she would be smiling texting me in the girls locker-room.

I started to take a step back when I saw that. And it hurt because here I am finding myself in a situation that isn't what I thought it was. I got my hopes up about her because she was very sweet in the beginning. She love bombed me, made plans that never came to be, had all these strong qualities I liked, told me she wanted to move slow, and of course our mutual friends told me that she likes and cares for me. I mean ffs she shared what her goals and future plans are and that she wanted to go in the same field as me so I even took her to my college so she could apply. Nonetheless, I started to question everything and her intentions even my own self-worth because I put her on a pedestal. 

Last month on March (28th) I messaged her friend Joan asking if she can give me advice about where Amber's headspace was at since they are close. I Told Joan that I liked Amber etc. etc. she's amazing, but I don't want to hurt myself emotionally if she's not ready. Joan promised to get back to me which she never did till I reached out two weeks later. I want to say on April 1st. Before reaching out to her, I gave Amber the benefit of the doubt because I drove her home one night (second to last week of march), and she argued with her family about her child being up and it got pretty heated since her mom and sister don't work, and they don't want to watch her kid while she's out all day working for the most part. Then baby daddy does petty shit to bother her like take her car seats without asking when he has custody on certain weeks. So, I just let her vent to me and comforted her. I let her know that she can talk to me and I'm ready for her when she is. I felt that we were in a good place right there because I saw a side of her that I haven't seen and that she has real shit going on. I slowed my brain down and it gave me clarity. Mind you I have tried asking her about this stuff, but she doesn't like to share with me, and I gave her the benefit of the doubt because of her hard upbringing struggling with homelessness, neglect from her parents, and bad relationships. Also, I heard a rumor from the guy Joan was fucking at the time that apparently Amber was crying about me. Saying that she likes me but doesn't know what she wants and that she's emotionally not ready. (Joan had told this guy she was fucking and that guy told me) However, things took a turn. I noticed at one point Ambers IG story and highlights stopped appearing on my page which is strange because they were always there, and she was active on social media. I had a feeling she restricted me, and I was right. During lunch one night, she opened her phone next to me and clicked on her story and shit began playing, she quickly closed it, and I think she noticed that I noticed. I took her home that night like nothing happened, and I just stepped back even more. At this point that rubbed me the wrong way and made me question everything again. I stopped taking her home after that.

Shortly after that night, she called out of work for about a week. I messaged her letting her know that I hope she's okay and that I'm here if she needs someone to lean on or go out for a coffee. I never heard from her. This is when Joan got back to me on April 1st. Joan told me that Amber was vague on the response and that she was dealing with a lot and that she was not emotionally ready for anything. She apologized to me for setting us up at the time and that she was sorry for any pain caused. I had my clarity and kept it pushing. I told Joan that I wasn't upset and that I hope Amber gets through what she's going through and that I will see them around at work. The next day on April 2nd Amber texts me late at 10PM just an hour before our shift is over and she is fucking fuming. Saying she's hearing shit from other people about how I feel about her among other bullshit. That I didn't tell her I was working the same day as her. (Idk why she put that, we have never shared every time one of us was working. Sometimes I didn't know she was working the same shift as me and I would not know until the night was done at clock out) She continued to text me that she goes through a lot mentally and no one knows how she feels. She came at me sideways like if I was her dude. I was like ""Woah, what the fuck?"" I offered to talk in person since she apparently hates texting, and I wanted to clear the air and get things off my chest and understand why she felt the way she did. Hopefully even set boundaries and see what this was. She didn't want to talk that night, so I offered to take her out for coffee next week on Monday which she agreed too. I checked in with her Sunday morning and she never responded to me until 8PM asking what time. She told me she was at the aquarium with her kid. Needless to say, the coffee didn't happen, and she stood me up. At this point I've done tooooo much. But it didn't sit well with me and I gave her the benefit of the doubt again. I called her Monday around the time we were supposed to go, and she told me that she still wants to meet up but that she has her kid and is calling her mom to watch her child. I asked her to keep me updated and that I would still be willing to pick her up and meet. She never got back to me or even apologized. She was out of work for a whole week with the flu, doctors note and everything. I ended up unfollowing her on Instagram because of the whole restriction thing and how she stood me up. There has been zero communication on her part. Funny enough before I unfollowed her, she was commenting under reels the same day she sent me that angry message to me. For context the post said, ""When he stops texting you good morning and calling you, so you know your free trial is over"".  She commented under that post saying, ""He doesn't care about me anymore"" and then a day after saying ""He still cares about me guys stop liking the comment"" (at this point I don't think I'm the only guy she was talking to)

The kicker is she wanted to talk about this in person when I offered and agreed to meet for coffee yet stands me up with no explanation. It gets better, she hits me up a week after she recovers and tells me her work schedule. Once again, no apology or explanation. I end up seeing her Friday before I leave home, and she tells me to have a goodnight and sorry we didn't get to talk in person today. (She was texting me Friday If I was going to be working).

At this point I don't believe I'm going to get the clarity I need from the talk she agreed to have after she sent me that message. I'm wondering if she's just really damaged or manipulative or both.

As far as I know from what I have seen/felt:

1. She lovedbombed me at the start \[I'm not familiar with dating out there or know what it's like. I've been in one solid relationship\]

2. It felt like she began breadcrumbing me with the super late texts and hitting me up randomly when I would not text her back and would say things like ""We should go hiking,"" I'm like cool let me know when you're available.

3. She is very bad at communication and seems to avoid ""confrontations"" despite agreeing to have them

4. Her actions aren't lying up with her words

5. Mixed signals

6. Has not made an effort to hang out or get to know me

7. Restricted off IG for whatever reason

8. Is telling other people she cares and likes me but hasn't told me herself??? (unless its all lies)

9. If two people like each other, it's never this difficult and communication is the bare minimum, time will be made in anyway so that two people can see each other and spend time with one another

9b. One night I was taking her home and she said, ""I don't like you having to give me a ride because I live so far away,"" I responded back, ""I like taking you home because I get to spend more time with you and hearing you sing"" (we would do karaoke in the car). Her response? Not a damn thing. Either she felt flustered by it or maybe didn't really care. It's whatever at this point

Is this what its like meeting people and trying to bond with them in 2025??? Am I the crazy one? 

I'm looking for advice and peoples input anything helps. I am stressed out my fucking mind especially with the unfinished ""talk"" about why she sent me that. It is causing me a bunch of emotional distress to the point where it has fucked with my peace. I have no problems in life, no real responsibility. I work, go to school, hit the gym, and take myself out from time to time. I was fine sharing my peace with someone so long as they reciprocated the same amount of energy and feelings back regardless of what they have going on. Why is it so hard for people to be honest and communicate especially if that's what you say you wanted? I never asked for anything, and I was upfront about my intentions. So there you have it.

Naturally, she was making me feel good while I was hurting, I didn't really fully process the breakup yet. She would call me almost every morning, leave me hearts in the messages and text me consistently for weeks. But out of nowhere she pulled back suddenly. Calls became less frequent to now none, text messages became hours apart sometimes never responding back. This made me spiral in my head thinking ""Was this a game to her?"" I thought we were on the same page. She told me she hasn't dated in 3 years. That she has only had 3 relationships (all of which ended with her being cheated on). She told me she valued consistency and honesty. That communication was not her strong suit and that she hates texting and would rather call. I would ask her out for coffee, or dinner, or even a hike since she told me she likes the outdoors. Not once have we hung out since February. I took it as her being busy since she's a mom and the only breadwinner in her household. But I would sometimes see her stories on IG, and she would be out with friends or chilling at home. Not just that, but as texts became less frequent and response times super long, we would take lunch together and she would be glued to her phone while I'm trying to talk with her. Calling people, texting people back and looking at memes. Mutual friends/co-workers would tell that she really likes me and cares for me. That she would be smiling texting me in the girls locker-room.

I started to take a step back when I saw that. And it hurt because here I am finding myself in a situation that isn't what I thought it was. I got my hopes up about her because she was very sweet in the beginning. She love bombed me, made plans that never came to be, had all these strong qualities I liked, told me she wanted to move slow, and of course our mutual friends told me that she likes and cares for me. I mean ffs she shared what her goals and future plans are and that she wanted to go in the same field as me so I even took her to my college so she could apply. Nonetheless, I started to question everything and her intentions even my own self-worth because I put her on a pedestal. 

Last month on March (28th) I messaged her friend Joan asking if she can give me advice about where Amber's headspace was at since they are close. I Told Joan that I liked Amber etc. etc. she's amazing, but I don't want to hurt myself emotionally if she's not ready. Joan promised to get back to me which she never did till I reached out two weeks later. I want to say on April 1st. Before reaching out to her, I gave Amber the benefit of the doubt because I drove her home one night (second to last week of march), and she argued with her family about her child being up and it got pretty heated since her mom and sister don't work, and they don't want to watch her kid while she's out all day working for the most part. Then baby daddy does petty shit to bother her like take her car seats without asking when he has custody on certain weeks. So, I just let her vent to me and comforted her. I let her know that she can talk to me and I'm ready for her when she is. I felt that we were in a good place right there because I saw a side of her that I haven't seen and that she has real shit going on. I slowed my brain down and it gave me clarity. Mind you I have tried asking her about this stuff, but she doesn't like to share with me, and I gave her the benefit of the doubt because of her hard upbringing struggling with homelessness, neglect from her parents, and bad relationships. Also, I heard a rumor from the guy Joan was fucking at the time that apparently Amber was crying about me. Saying that she likes me but doesn't know what she wants and that she's emotionally not ready. (Joan had told this guy she was fucking and that guy told me) However, things took a turn. I noticed at one point Ambers IG story and highlights stopped appearing on my page which is strange because they were always there, and she was active on social media. I had a feeling she restricted me, and I was right. During lunch one night, she opened her phone next to me and clicked on her story and shit began playing, she quickly closed it, and I think she noticed that I noticed. I took her home that night like nothing happened, and I just stepped back even more. At this point that rubbed me the wrong way and made me question everything again. I stopped taking her home after that.

Shortly after that night, she called out of work for about a week. I messaged her letting her know that I hope she's okay and that I'm here if she needs someone to lean on or go out for a coffee. I never heard from her. This is when Joan got back to me on April 1st. Joan told me that Amber was vague on the response and that she was dealing with a lot and that she was not emotionally ready for anything. She apologized to me for setting us up at the time and that she was sorry for any pain caused. I had my clarity and kept it pushing. I told Joan that I wasn't upset and that I hope Amber gets through what she's going through and that I will see them around at work. The next day on April 2nd Amber texts me late at 10PM just an hour before our shift is over and she is fucking fuming. Saying she's hearing shit from other people about how I feel about her among other bullshit. That I didn't tell her I was working the same day as her. (Idk why she put that, we have never shared every time one of us was working. Sometimes I didn't know she was working the same shift as me and I would not know until the night was done at clock out) She continued to text me that she goes through a lot mentally and no one knows how she feels. She came at me sideways like if I was her dude. I was like ""Woah, what the fuck?"" I offered to talk in person since she apparently hates texting, and I wanted to clear the air and get things off my chest and understand why she felt the way she did. Hopefully even set boundaries and see what this was. She didn't want to talk that night, so I offered to take her out for coffee next week on Monday which she agreed too. I checked in with her Sunday morning and she never responded to me until 8PM asking what time. She told me she was at the aquarium with her kid. Needless to say, the coffee didn't happen, and she stood me up. At this point I've done tooooo much. But it didn't sit well with me, and I gave her the benefit of the doubt again. I called her Monday around the time we were supposed to go, and she told me that she still wants to meet up but that she has her kid and is calling her mom to watch her child. I asked her to keep me updated and that I would still be willing to pick her up and meet. She never got back to me or even apologized. She was out of work for a whole week with the flu, doctors note and everything. I ended up unfollowing her on Instagram because of the whole restriction thing and how she stood me up. There has been zero communication on her part. Funny enough before I unfollowed her, she was commenting under reels the same day she sent me that angry message to me. For context the post said, ""When he stops texting you good morning and calling you, so you know your free trial is over"".  She commented under that post saying, ""He doesn't care about me anymore"" and then a day after saying ""He still cares about me guys stop liking the comment"" (at this point I don't think I'm the only guy she was talking to)

The kicker is she wanted to talk about this in person when I offered and agreed to meet for coffee yet stands me up with no explanation. It gets better, she hits me up a week after she recovers and tells me her work schedule. Once again, no apology or explanation. I end up seeing her Friday before I leave home, and she tells me to have a goodnight and sorry we didn't get to talk in person today. (She was texting me Friday If I was going to be working).

At this point I don't believe I'm going to get the clarity I need from the talk she agreed to have after she sent me that message. I'm wondering if she's just really damaged or manipulative or both.

As far as I know from what I have seen/felt:

1. She lovedbombed me at the start \[I'm not familiar with dating out there or know what it's like. I've been in one solid relationship\]

2. It felt like she began breadcrumbing me with the super late texts and hitting me up randomly when I would not text her back and would say things like ""We should go hiking,"" I'm like cool let me know when you're available.

3. She is very bad at communication and seems to avoid ""confrontations"" despite agreeing to have them

4. Her actions aren't lying up with her words

5. Mixed signals

6. Has not made an effort to hang out or get to know me

7. Restricted off IG for whatever reason

8. Is telling other people she cares and likes me but hasn't told me herself??? (unless it's all lies)

9. If two people like each other, it's never this difficult and communication is the bare minimum, time will be made in anyway so that two people can see each other and spend time with one another

9b. One night I was taking her home and she said, ""I don't like you having to give me a ride because I live so far away,"" I responded back, ""I like taking you home because I get to spend more time with you and hearing you sing"" (we would do karaoke in the car). Her response? Not a damn thing. Either she felt flustered by it or maybe didn't really care. It's whatever at this point

Is this what it's like meeting people and trying to bond with them in 2025??? Am I the crazy one? 

I'm looking for advice and peoples input anything helps. I am stressed out my fucking mind especially with the unfinished ""talk"" about why she sent me that. It is causing me a bunch of emotional distress to the point where it has fucked with my peace. I have no problems in life, no real responsibility. I work, go to school, hit the gym, and take myself out from time to time. I was fine sharing my peace with someone so long as they reciprocated the same amount of energy and feelings back regardless of what they have going on. Why is it so hard for people to be honest and communicate especially if that's what you say you wanted? I never asked for anything, and I was upfront about my intentions. So, there you have it.

1k9kuwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k9kuwa/my_28f_husband_27m_might_be_a_covert_narcissist/,"My (28f) husband (27m) might be a covert narcissist, advice?","So, my husband and I met in May of 2019 via hinge. 

I had been in a rough relationship for 2 years with a guy from 18-21, friends with him since 16. I waited a year before dating again. 

This guy, let’s call him Andrew, seemed amazing. Funny, compassionate, driven, honest. He wasn’t my exact type physically, but he had such charisma. I had a date that weekend with another guy from hinge that had been previously set up to Andrew (this is important later), and it was bleh, so I stuck with dating Andrew.

He wanted to become official after the third date, to which I politely asked if we could wait. We did. We became official in July. I didn’t know much about his family, we lived about 45 min away from one another, not too far. 

He was complimentary, kind, respectful. He took us to antique malls, coffee shops, we did arts and crafts, etc. I’d attend sports things he liked, so on. 

Important note number 2: I am chronically ill. I have POTS, PANS, (I joke I’m a kitchen), EDS, Fibromyalgia and migraines. I told him these minus EDS once I got that diagnosis last year. He was completely okay with this, as he had mental health issues (depression, social anxiety). I understood, having my own such as anxiety, ocd, adhd. 

Covid hits, we continue to date. I see his family less and vice versa dude to it. He proposes October. We get married April.

Things change.

He states he doesn’t like the church he goes to anymore (dealbreaker for me at the time. He said his friends left the church, so he quit going.) 

Still, to this day, will tell acquaintances I “cheated” on him because I went on a date with that other guy after our FIRST DATE.

He makes little jabs. They’re jokes!! Just jokes. Like, “why don’t you go and make me a sandwich?” Or, “oh good job, you finally didn’t laundry!” And I believed that. Until last summer, when it got really bad. I thought it was just me. I thought I was the problem. But he began to make me feel like any request, any help, was such a chore. I mean, “hey can you clean your bowl from dinner please?” When I’m absolutely exhausted from cooking dinner and need to lie down. He sets it beside the sink. Here is a list I’ve compiled:

He would NOT let me tell my parents if we argued. Said it was just between us. The few times I told my mom out of OCD guilt, he got furious. 

“If I treated you the way you wanted me to, I’d be doing a full caretaker job.”



“If (my niece, who is goth) wore a dress, it wouldn’t look right because of her style. If I wore what she did-“
“Which no one ever should.” (Shaming her style.)

“You threw trash on my face”
“We were in a playful mood.”
“No we weren’t.” (I was lying down. He threw plastic from my supplement bottle on my face because it was on his side of the bed.)

“Can you try to not look like you want to kill yourself?” During his presentation, said in front of his sister. I was just watching.

“Look, there’s two whales by the pool.” Talking about overweight women. I called him out, and he cried. 

My psychiatrist said he was a narcissist, so I set a boundary. I left for my parents a week ago. We WhatsApp called, and he said two weeks for no talking, I agreed. Then when he kept texting me, I said I was trying to respect that and he said “I’m sorry I gave you that impression.” 
Felt like boundaries weren’t respected, and he twisted his own words.

He tapped my face during play fights. I say he did. “I’ve done that before.” I knew he hadn’t, he swore he had. I said to never do that again. 

Asked for time to sort through my feelings and thoughts, he kept coming into the room to ask if it was “about us though.” And “but are we okay?” When I came home after being out with Felicity, he was withdrawn and doing the same thing, saying he just needed time. 

Not believing in uv radiation as a joke for almost 2 years until I nearly broke up with him and then he said it was all a “bit”.

Parents offered to pay to have someone professionally clean apartment, he got very defensive. Why? If we are both too busy or out of energy, why? 

He absolutely cries if I give him any criticism. He’ll say he’s fat. Or his hair looks ugly. I say it doesn’t. He sulks. He has no self esteem. Refuses to go on medicine for his depression. Says his counselor (where I have seen no change) helps enough. 

Twisting my words. Guilt tripping. Crying for attention. Saying he cries because of me. Blame shifting! 

Am I freaking crazy? Is this covert narcissism? I’m setting up couples counseling as a last resort before divorce to see if there’s a shred of any of the 6 years I can salvage since we are both religious. Praise that there’s NO KIDS. Because he, Cherry on top, has a porn addiction. Which he swore he quit. He’s never finished in me. Said he couldn’t wear a condom. He can’t keep it up wearing one. I don’t want a baby, and would rather not get a BV with spermicide, or heavy periods with a copper IUD. I went on the mini pill year one of our marriage and was a walking bitch on wheels that got two periods a month. Hormones are out. Please, advice. Thank you.

As we stepped into the hotel lobby, Karri instantly shrank back — hiding half behind me, her hands clutching my arm tightly.  
Her brave walk through the hallways had drained her boldness — and now, under the bright lights of the lobby, surrounded by families and couples, the reality of her outfit hit her hard.

The thin red mesh dress was barely covering her.  
No bra. No panties.  
Every curve, every mark from our wild nights, every secret... whispered through the sheer fabric.

She kept her head low, hair falling over her face, blushing deep.

And then — it happened.

An Indian couple, maybe mid-30s, noticed us.  
The woman, wearing a simple kurti and jeans, smiled warmly and walked over.

""Meeru Hyderabad nunchi vachhara? Telugu vinipinchindi!""  
(""Are you from Hyderabad? I heard you speaking Telugu!"")

Karri froze — like a deer in headlights.  
I smiled awkwardly and nodded.

The woman kept chatting, friendly and curious, while Karri — mortified — stood there trembling slightly, clutching my hand so tightly I could feel her nails digging in.

Every few seconds, Karri would nervously tug at the hem of her almost-nonexistent dress, trying hopelessly to pull it lower.  
The Indian lady's eyes flickered — clearly shocked at Karri’s outfit — but too polite to say anything.

That’s when John approached — calm, confident, grinning like the devil himself.

Without hesitation, he slid his strong arm casually around Karri's bare, trembling shoulders and said:

""Hey there — I’m John. Their friend. We’ve been having one hell of a vacation!""

Karri nearly died on the spot.  
Her face turned deep crimson.  
Her body stiffened under his touch.  
She looked like she wanted the floor to open and swallow her whole.

The thin dress clung to her shy body,  
her dark nipples clearly outlined through the wet, see-through mesh,  
the golden thali swinging gently between her bare breasts,  
and lower — the curves of her hips and thighs completely visible through the golden crisscross strings.

The Indian woman blinked — stunned — eyes darting between Karri’s almost-nude body, my awkward smile, and John's cocky grin.

Karri pressed herself tightly against me, clutching my arm with both hands now, desperate for cover — her soft, warm body trembling against mine.

The Indian husband, noticing the situation, mumbled something quickly to his wife, and they politely excused themselves, walking away with hurried, embarrassed steps.

John chuckled softly.  
Karri buried her face against my chest, whispering:

""Nee vallaki naa roopam chaala clear ga gurthu untundi ippudu...""  
(""They’ll never forget seeing me like this..."")

I gently kissed the top of her head, wrapping my arms around her protectively — feeling both her shame and her strange, thrilling excitement.

We quickly finished checkout, Karri practically glued to my side, hiding her glowing, almost-naked body behind me every step of the way.

But even as she blushed and trembled...  
A tiny, secret smile played at the edges of her lips.

Somewhere deep inside her shy, tender heart —  
a new, wild Karri was waking up.

  


🌸 **Parking Lot Secrets — New Friends, New Dangers** 🌸

We were about to get into the car when we heard a cheerful call:

""Anna! Okkasari group photo teesukundama?""  
(""Brother! Shall we take one group photo?"")

It was Prasad and Sureka, waving from near their car.

Sureka giggled, her bright smile lighting up the morning.  
Laxmi hesitated, hiding half behind me, her bare thighs trembling under the flimsy red mesh.

John grinned and happily grabbed the DSLR camera Sureka offered.  
Without fully understanding the Telugu, he sensed what was happening — and looked more than eager to capture Laxmi's helpless, exposed beauty again.

We lined up — me, Laxmi, Prasad, and Sureka.

As we posed, Prasad casually placed his hand on Laxmi’s delicate shoulder.  
Her entire body tensed under the bold, almost possessive touch.

The mesh fabric clung tighter to her curves,  
the thali swinging gently between her small, heaving breasts,  
her dusky nipples perfectly outlined through the thin red.

John snapped photo after photo, smirking.

In between shots, Prasad smiled and asked in Telugu:

""Meeru Hyderabad lo ekkada?""  
(""Where in Hyderabad are you from?"")

I smiled awkwardly, still holding Laxmi tightly.

""Manam Kukatpally nunchi.""  
(""We’re from Kukatpally."")

Sureka's face lit up:

""Wow! Memu Madhapur nunchi! Chala daggaragane undi!""  
(""Wow! We’re from Madhapur! So close!"")

Laxmi blinked in shock, trembling more.  
Sureka clapped her hands happily:

""Chaala bagundhi! Mana mana vallu dorikina feeling untundi kada!""  
(""It feels so nice finding our people here, right!"")

John, holding the camera, watched this rapid Telugu chatter with amusement, clearly enjoying Laxmi’s blushing even without understanding.

Sureka leaned closer and whispered to Laxmi mischievously:

""Dress chala bold ra akka... aah confidence vere level.""  
(""Your dress is so bold, akka... your confidence is another level!"")

Laxmi buried her burning face into my arm, half-hiding her smile.

  


**A Casual Question Turns Everything**

Just as we were about to finish, Prasad casually asked:  
**""America lo ekkada untaru meeru?""** (""Where do you live in America?"")

Still clinging to my arm, Laxmi stammered:  
**""Tennessee... Nashville lo.""** (""In Tennessee... Nashville area."")

Sureka's face lit up:  
**""Wow! Mem kuda Nashville lo untamu! 15 minutes distance untundi!""** (""Wow! We’re also in Nashville! It's just 15 minutes away!"")

Laxmi’s heart skipped a beat — her cheeks burning hotter than ever.

Sureka giggled:  
**""Mana Indian parties lo tappakunda kalustam!""** (""We’ll definitely meet at Indian parties then!"")

John just stood there, half-smirking, sipping his coffee, clearly enjoying Laxmi’s shy helplessness without understanding much Telugu.

  


**The Group Picture**

Then came the moment:  
**""Group pic teesukundam!""** (""Let’s take a group picture!"")

John stepped forward, grabbing the DSLR, while we lined up again near the car.  
Laxmi desperately tried to adjust her scandalously sheer red mesh dress, pulling the hem lower, tugging at the thin straps, but it was hopeless.  
Nothing could hide her body now.

Prasad stood beside Laxmi, slipping his hand over her shoulder for the photo.  
But as the moment stretched...  
his hand **""accidentally""** slipped lower...  
grazing the very top of her exposed breast through the see-through fabric, his fingers almost brushing the black areola.

Laxmi stiffened, panic flashing in her eyes.  
She instinctively shifted her body closer into me — her soft side pressing against my ribs — but she didn’t dare cause a scene.

John, behind the camera, chuckled softly as he clicked another photo.  
**""Smile!""** he teased.

Laxmi gave the tiniest, most helpless smile — her whole body trembling.  
The camera clicked again — a crystal-clear, high-definition capture of:

* Laxmi standing half-naked under the bright sun,
* Prasad's hand almost cupping her breast,
* her thali glittering wildly against her naked chest,
* and her mesh dress doing nothing to hide her shame.

  


**Compliments and More Embarrassment**

After the photos, Sureka giggled:  
**""Chala bagundi! Nuvvu model laga vunnav ra Laxmi!""** (""So beautiful! You look like a model, Laxmi!"")

Laxmi mumbled shyly:  
**""Naa dress konchem... light ekkuva undi kada...""** (""My dress is a bit... too light, isn’t it..."")

Sureka winked:  
**""Anduke sexy ga vuntundi!""** (""That’s why it looks sexy!"")

John handed the camera back and laughed:  
**""You all look... unforgettable.""**

We quickly exchanged numbers — phones beeping with new contacts.

  


**The Real Shock**

As we set up for the final group selfie — me, Laxmi, John, Sureka, and Prasad —  
John casually stepped behind Laxmi, pretending to ""help"" fix her dress.

With a mischievous tug,  
he pulled the mesh up slightly — not down —  
lifting it enough to expose the underside of her breasts,  
the black, puffy areola clearly visible under the red.

Sureka's eyes widened — stunned — seeing everything.  
The transparent dress clung tighter, shamelessly revealing:

* Laxmi’s bare side-boob,
* dark, swollen nipple pressing against the mesh,
* John’s rough hand suspiciously low on her waist — almost on her ass.

Sureka awkwardly cleared her throat, but said nothing.  
Poor Laxmi...  
Her whole body stiffened under John's touch, her nails digging into my palm.  
Still, she couldn't stop it.  
She couldn't protest.  
She couldn't escape.

The camera clicked again. 📸  
Another crystal-clear, almost pornographic shot.

  


**Tension in the Parking Lot**

After the final pic, Sureka laughed nervously:  
**""Meeru chala bindass ra Laxmi! America lo full freedom kada!""** (""You’re so bold, Laxmi! Full freedom in America, right!"")

Laxmi just gave a tiny, broken laugh — burying her burning face against my shoulder.  
Sureka hugged Laxmi lightly — feeling the sheer wet fabric — and whispered.

In the parking lot, Laxmi clung to my arm, trembling,  
as John walked just a few steps behind us, grinning wide.

She whispered softly to me in Telugu:  
**""Nenu ippatiki shock lo unnanu... na dress lo vallaki anni kanipistunnayi...""**  
(""I’m still in shock... they saw everything through my dress..."")

I kissed her forehead and whispered back:  
**""Nee roopam, na adrustam.""** (""Your beauty is my blessing."")

Her thali glittered in the sunlight —  
the final proof that no matter how wild, how exposed, how humiliated she felt —  
her heart belonged to me, and me alone.

I pulled Laxmi closer, grinning wickedly, and said loud enough for everyone to hear:  
**""Balle unnavvu ra lanje laga... Prasad ki kannaalu venaka pettaledu nee pai... vadidi kinda sagam perigindi chusava?""**  
(""You look damn good, like a real slut... Prasad can’t even blink looking at you... did you see? He’s half hard down there already!"")

John burst out laughing even though he didn’t understand the Telugu — he could feel the wild energy.  
Sureka’s mouth dropped open slightly, blushing fiercely but trying to hide it.  
Prasad awkwardly shifted, trying to hide himself, but it was too late.

And poor Laxmi...  
Her whole body shivered against me — humiliated beyond words.  
Her hands instinctively tried to pull down the sheer red dress — but it was hopeless.

* Her dusky nipples,
* her soft belly,
* even the hint of her wet slit —

everything was outlined for everyone to see.  
Her golden thali swung helplessly between her breasts, glittering like a sinful necklace of shame and love.

Her face buried into my chest, whispering almost inaudibly:  
**""Please... let’s go...""**

But even as she begged,  
her body pressed tighter against mine —  
betraying her secret excitement. 🌸

  


**The Drive Home**

We finally got into the car.  
Laxmi, trembling, quickly buckled her seatbelt — still trying to pull her scandalous red mesh dress lower over her thighs, even though it was hopeless.

As I started the engine, my phone buzzed — a new message.  
Since I was driving, Laxmi picked it up and checked.  
It was from Prasad:  
**Prasad:**  
*""Nice meeting you guys today! Safe drive! See you around soon!""*

Laxmi let out a small, shaky breath — half relief, half leftover nervousness.  
She handed the phone to me, her fingers brushing mine, still ice-cold from the tension.

I smiled a little, squeezing her hand reassuringly.  
**""No drama,""** I said softly.  
**""Just friendly people.""**

  


**The Photos**

But Laxmi’s mind was still stuck on the photos.  
Her thumb hesitated over the chat — and she couldn't resist.  
She tapped open the gallery.

And there they were.  
The parking lot photos.  
Crystal clear.  
Every scandalous, humiliating detail captured forever.

The group shots —  
where Prasad’s hand was way too low, brushing the top of her breast.

The close-ups —  
where the sheer red mesh exposed the dark circles of her nipples.

The cursed moment —  
where John’s hand adjusted her dress upwards, flashing half her areola, fully visible to the camera.

Laxmi’s face turned beet red.  
Her hand flew to her mouth in horror as she zoomed into one of the worst photos.

From her angle, she could see it even clearer:

* The curve of her exposed sideboob,
* The glittering thali chain slicing across her naked chest,
* Prasad’s eyes glued shamelessly to her body,
* Sureka’s stunned expression,
* John smirking behind the camera.

She gasped softly, clutching the phone against her chest — as if trying to erase what she had just seen.

I glanced sideways at her, smirking a little.  
One hand on the wheel, the other gently resting on her trembling bare thigh.

**""You looked beautiful,""** I said in Telugu, low and teasing.

Laxmi shook her head fiercely, burying her burning face into my arm.

But her body...  
...her body was betraying her.  
Her thighs rubbing slowly together under the flimsy mesh.  
Her chest rising and falling fast.

  


**A New Invitation**

As we drove toward home, Laxmi’s phone buzzed again.  
She glanced down — expecting maybe another polite goodbye from Prasad.

But no —  
this time it was a message from Sureka, directly to Laxmi:  
**Sureka:**  
*""Laxmi! Chala bagundhi ee roju... super fun talking with you!* 😘  
*Let's meet at home sometime! Small get-together chestham!""*  
(""Laxmi! Today was so nice... it was super fun talking to you! Let’s meet at home sometime! We’ll do a small get-together!"")

Laxmi smiled nervously, her fingers hesitating over the keyboard.  
Still blushing, she typed a soft reply:

**Laxmi:**  
*""Sure ra! Chala santosham ga undi meet avvadam!* ❤️*""*  
(""Sure! I’m so happy we met too!"")

Just as she hit send, another notification popped up.  
Sureka had started a new group chat:  
🏖️ **""Nashville Friends""** 🏖️  
**Members:**

* Prasad
* Sureka
* Me (you)
* Laxmi
* John

Immediately, a message came:

**Sureka:**  
*""Sharing the best pic from today! Memories!* 😍*""*

And she uploaded a photo.

  


**The Ultimate Humiliation**

Laxmi tapped to open it full screen...  
and she froze.  
Her heart almost stopped.

In the main photo:

* Her red mesh dress was almost completely invisible in the sunlight.
* Her lower half was clearly bare — no panties visible at all.
* 95% of her breasts were exposed, the dark circles of her nipples shining clearly through the wet fabric.
* Behind her, in the side mirror of the car, you could see her full bare back — smooth, glistening, completely nude, every curve perfectly reflected.

It was obscene.  
Accidental... but obscene.  
Worse — it was now shared in a group where Prasad and John could zoom and stare freely.

Laxmi gasped, covering her mouth with her hands, her phone trembling in her grip.

She looked at me, wide-eyed, desperate, whispering:  
**""Photos lo anni kanipistunnayi... Naku teliyadhu...""**  
(""Everything is showing in the photos... I didn’t even know..."")

I calmly squeezed her bare thigh, smirking slightly:  
**""Late ayipoyindi ra... ippudu andariki telusu...""**  
(""Too late, baby... now everyone knows..."")

On the chat, Prasad reacted with 🔥🔥 emojis.  
John casually dropped a 😍.

Laxmi's whole body shrank smaller against the car door, her legs squeezing together —  
burning alive with helpless shame,  
but unable to stop staring at the scandalous picture of herself.

She could see every filthy detail if she zoomed in —

* the hard nipples,
* the bare back,
* even a faint hint of her smooth mound if you looked close enough.

And now...  
it was saved in all their phones.  
**Forever.**

  


As Laxmi stared at the scandalous photo on her phone, still trembling,  
another notification buzzed.

🏖️ **Nashville Friends Group Changed Profile Picture.**  
**Updated by: Sureka.**

Laxmi blinked in horror —  
she quickly tapped the group chat.

And there it was.

**Sureka had set the group profile picture** —  
not just any random safe photo —  
but **that** exact **scandalous** group photo:

* Her see-through red mesh
* Bare thighs
* 95% exposed nipples
* The shimmering thali chain swinging across her bare chest
* Her completely **nude back** visible in the car mirror.

**That photo**  
was now the **official face** of the group —  
**publicly pinned** at the top for anyone who opened the chat to see immediately.

Laxmi gasped, her fingers flying to her mouth again.

""Profile pic... chesaru... aa photo..."" she whispered, tears almost filling her eyes.  
(""They made... *that photo*... the profile picture..."")

I laughed under my breath, unable to hide the wicked grin spreading across my face.

""Chaala beautiful group face undi kada..."" I teased softly.  
(""Isn’t it a beautiful group face now?"")

From the backseat, John — who had been quietly checking his phone — chuckled and said:

""Man, that's a HOT profile pic! 🔥 Lucky group!""

He still didn't know all the Telugu context —  
but he knew exactly what he was looking at.

Prasad casually dropped a voice note into the group:

**Prasad:**  
*""thanks to John!”*

Laxmi was frozen in her seat —  
face buried in her palms,  
her body pressed tightly against the door,  
desperate to hide, to disappear, to undo everything —  
but there was no escape now.

Every second that passed, the group notification stayed proudly pinned:  
🏖️ **Nashville Friends** — with **Laxmi's nude body** as the cover.

  


  


  


🌸 **Parking Lot Secrets + Nashville Friends Group Explosion** 🌸

As we drove on, the car buzzing with tension,  
another burst of notifications exploded from the **Nashville Friends** group.

**John**, excited by the new group energy, casually uploaded a few of his own photos before Laxmi could even react:

📸 **1st Photo**:

* Laxmi stepping out of the ocean in that sheer black bikini.
* Water pouring off her glistening body.
* The wet, clinging fabric turning almost invisible.
* Her full breasts — dark nipples standing hard — clearly visible through the fabric.
* Her hips, thighs, even the soft shadow of her mound visible between her legs.

📸 **2nd Photo**:

* Inside the wild beach club.
* Laxmi, totally drunk, laughing uncontrollably.
* Her mini-skirt bunched up over her tummy, **clearly exposing** everything.
* Her flimsy black cami top almost torn off, barely hanging from one strap.
* Two of John's friends holding her:
   * One had a full grip on her exposed breast.
   * Another grabbed her bare ass, grinding into her drunken, helpless body.

Both photos were brutally clear — full HD, bright lighting — **nothing left to imagination**.

Before Laxmi could even scream or protest — the images were posted.  
**Instantly saved** by everyone in the group.  
**Permanent**.

Laxmi gasped in horror, grabbing at her phone — but it was too late.  
She curled tighter into her seat,  
shaking uncontrollably,  
then suddenly — she **burst into tears**.

Silent, broken crying —  
her small body trembling against the car door,  
one hand over her mouth to muffle the sounds.

I glanced at her with a wicked smile...  
relishing every second of her helpless shame.

  


**Group Chat Explodes:**

Prasad tried to say something polite:

**Prasad** 🙏**:**  
""Super daring moments captured beautifully.""

(And then he stayed silent, only reacting later.)

But **Sureka** went absolutely wild —  
flooding it with Telugu comments, laughing emojis, hearts, and praises:

**Sureka** 🔥**:**  
""Laxmi akka, nuvvu full bold queen ra!""  
(""Laxmi akka, you're a full bold queen!"")

**Sureka** 😂**:**  
""Ahaaa... America lo full freedom ante idi kada!""  
(""Ahaa... this is what full freedom in America means!"")

**Sureka** 😈**:**  
""Next party ki sexy dress compulsory ra!""  
(""Next party, sexy dress is a must!"")

Then she teased even more savagely:

**Sureka** 👑**:**  
""Stretch marks kooda visible ra... chala realistic ga beautiful ga unnayi!""  
(""Even your stretch marks are visible... looking so real and beautiful!"")

**Sureka** ❤️**:**  
""C-section scar chusanu beach pic lo... pure mommy queen ra!""  
(""I saw your C-section scar in the beach pic... pure mommy queen!"")

**Sureka** 😍**:**  
""Beach lo chala mandhi staring chesthunaru... nenu akkadunte direct touch cheyyadaniki try chesthey!""  
(""So many people were staring at you at the beach... if I was there, I would've tried to touch you directly!"")

**BOOM.**

Sureka set the **worst beach club photo** —  
Laxmi’s drunk, exposed body —  
as the **group profile picture**.

  


**Laxmi’s Heartbreak Response:**

Still crying silently,  
her fingers trembling,  
Laxmi finally typed back — in broken, shaky Telugu:

**Laxmi** 🌸 **(typing slowly, tears dropping):**  
""Sorry Sureka akka... naaku chala bayam vesthundi... nenu chala cheap ga feel chesthunnanu...""  
(""Sorry Sureka akka... I feel so scared... I feel so cheap..."")

For a moment the group went quiet.

Then Sureka messaged something so raw, so unexpected, it stunned even me:

**Sureka** 🌸**:**  
""Nenu kuda wish chesthunnanu... college days lo ila enjoy chesthunte bagundedi... aa freedom, aa madness... nee story chala inspiring ga undi Laxmi!""  
(""I also wish I had done all this... if only I had enjoyed like this during my college days... your story is so inspiring, Laxmi!"")

And quietly,  
**Prasad** reacted with just a ❤️ on Sureka’s message.

Nothing more.

Silent approval.  
Silent pride.

  


**Calm After the Storm — Personal Chatting Starts:**

The energy shifted after that.

Sureka sent another softer, more emotional message:

**Sureka** 😊**:**  
""Nuvvu oka baaga prema chese ammayi ra Laxmi... chala manchi soul... idi journey matram... body shame ledu, only memories undali.""  
(""You're a girl full of love, Laxmi... you have such a beautiful soul... this is just a journey... no body shame, only memories should stay."")

John added:

**John** 🍻**:**  
""You’re awesome! Can't wait to hang out again. Chill BBQ next weekend?""

Finally, Laxmi calmed down a little.  
She wiped her wet cheeks, closed her eyes for a second,  
and slowly smiled... tiny, but real.

She replied to the group:

**Laxmi** 🌸**:**  
""Mee words vinaka... naaku strength vastundi... thank you everyone... love you all...""  
(""Hearing your words... I'm gaining strength... thank you everyone... love you all..."")

Sureka immediately responded:

**Sureka** ❤️**:**  
""We love you more ra bold queen!""

And for the first time that night —  
Laxmi laughed softly.

A broken, wet laugh...  
but a **free** one.

The shame was still there.  
The humiliation burned deep.  
But now... it was wrapped in something **sweet**.  
Acceptance.  
Friendship.  
Freedom.

🌸🌸🌸

  


  


After the wild group chat calmed down a little,  
Sureka created a **private side chat** — just her and Laxmi.

**Sureka** ❤️**:**

""Ra Laxmi... ninnu personal ga matladali anipistundi... cheppali chala emotions...""  
(""Hey Laxmi... I feel like talking to you personally... so many emotions to share..."")

**Laxmi** 🌸 **(still shy):**

""Cheppu akka...""  
(""Tell me, akka..."")

Before Sureka could start,  
**John** — ever cheerful — jumped into the main group chat:

**John** 🍻**:**

""Hey hey! Speak English please! 😂 I’m feeling left out!""

Laxmi and Sureka both **burst out laughing** privately.

**Sureka** 😈**:**

""Let him feel left out ra... mana secret fun better!""  
(""Let him feel left out... our secret fun is better!"")

They both **ignored John** completely,  
giggling like naughty sisters,  
switching fully back to Telugu.

  


**Sureka Starts Teasing Again (Sweetly + Shamelessly):**

**Sureka** 🔥**:**

""Ra Laxmi... beach pic lo... nee buttocks full HD lo shining laga vunnayi... proud ga feel avvali ra!""  
(""Laxmi... your buttocks were shining in full HD in the beach pic... you should feel proud!"")

**Sureka** 😂**:**

""Beach lo local boys pakkana undaga... camera lekapoyina... they already undressed you with their eyes ra!""  
(""Even without cameras, the local boys at the beach had already undressed you with their eyes!"")

**Laxmi** 🌸 **(blushing, shy typing):**

""Akkaaa... nenu chala cheap ga feel aipotunna... enduku ila avvutondi naaku...""  
(""Akkaaa... I still feel so cheap... why am I becoming like this..."")

**Sureka** 😍**:**

""Cheap? Ra crazy girl... idi real boldness! Real woman ante body ni accept cheyatam, flaunt cheyatam!""  
(""Cheap? You crazy girl... this is real boldness! A real woman accepts her body and flaunts it!"")

**Sureka** 👑**:**

""Stretch marks, C-section scar, sagging, drunken madness — anni mana story part ra! Dairyam ante idi!""  
(""Stretch marks, C-section scars, sagging, drunken madness — it’s all part of our story! This is what real courage means!"")

  


**Laxmi's Heart Softens... and Pride Sparks:**

Slowly,  
Laxmi wiped her tears again...  
but this time she was **smiling**.

Her fingers hovered over the keyboard,  
then typed:

**Laxmi** 🌸**:**

""Akka... nenu ippudu proud ga feel chesthunnanu... nenu na flaws tho kuda beautiful anipistundi.""  
(""Akka... I'm finally feeling proud... I feel beautiful even with my flaws."")

**Sureka** 💖 **(excited):**

""Yessss ra cutie queen! Idhe spirit! Full body love, full memory love!""  
(""Yessss cutie queen! This is the spirit! Full body love, full memory love!"")

**Sureka** 🔥**:**

""Next party lo... bikini remove cheyyali... full natural photoshoot! 😈""  
(""Next party... you should remove the bikini too... full natural photoshoot! 😈"")

**Laxmi** 🌸 **(shy but playful):**

""Akkaaa... chalu ra... inka excitement handle cheyyalekapothunnanu...""  
(""Akkaaa... stop it... I can't handle more excitement now..."")

They both laughed together —  
warm, mischievous, happy.

Their bond, woven tighter by shame, courage, boldness, madness —  
**now blooming into pure sisterhood**.

  


Meanwhile, in the main group chat,  
**John** had sent a confused emoji:

""??? 😅 You girls plotting something?""

They both just smiled at their screens,  
completely ignoring him again,  
lost in their own wild, spicy, beautiful world. 🌸

  


  


*VERY* fun weekend! 😂😂""

The whole group **erupted into laughter**.

  


🌸 **Everyone Dying Laughing** 🌸

**Sureka** 😂**:**

""John full energy drain ayipoyadu ra first day nunchi! 😂""

**Laxmi** 🌸**:**

""Nenu ayipoya akka... John kuda ayipoyadu... beach lo lock lo... 🤣""

**John** ❤️**:**

(Just spamming the chat with laughing faces, clapping emojis, and hearts.)

**Prasad** 😂**:**

""Need to book another beach house fast... illa ante next party ki energy ledu ra! 🍻""

  


🌸 **Mood at the End**

The car was filled with **Laxmi's soft, helpless giggles**,  
the phone buzzing nonstop,  
the Nashville Friends group **overflowing with laughter, teasing, crazy love**.

Me, still driving — heart pounding, face burning —  
but a slow smile creeping over my face too.

Because somehow...  
this madness... this chaos...  
felt like the most **wildly beautiful memory** we'd ever created together. 🌸

  


🌸 **Private Chat Explodes - John Gets Angry** 🌸

While Sureka and Laxmi were laughing and bonding in Telugu,  
John started getting annoyed.

**John** 😠 **(main group chat):**

""If you guys don't talk in English, I'll send one more pic! 😡""

Laxmi and Sureka both paused, looked at each other through their phones,  
then typed at the same time — bold, fearless, wicked smiles on their faces:

**Sureka** 😈**:**

""Go ahead ra! 😘 What else is there to hide now?""

**Laxmi** 🌸 **(giggling):**

""Yeah John... no secrets anymore! 😜""

John didn’t wait even a second — with devilish confidence, he uploaded one more bomb photo.

  


📸 **New Photo Sent:**

* From the very first night at the beach house.
* Laxmi’s bare back, nude and glowing under the moonlight.
* Her mouth wrapped around the chastity lock at my waist.
* A teasing, intimate moment — raw, shameless, wild.
* The angle was artistic but extremely suggestive — only her messy hair, bare back, and the lock against her lips were visible — but anyone could guess exactly what was happening.

  


🌸 **Group Explodes Again** 🌸

The entire Nashville Friends group froze for a second —  
nobody typed —  
shock and wild excitement buzzing in the air.

And then, Sureka couldn't control herself —  
she burst out laughing so hard in the chat:

**Sureka** 😂🔥**:**

""Ayoooo super akka pic! 😂🔥 Loved the way you locked him! Looks like fun ra!""  
(""Oh my God! Super akka pic! 😂🔥 Loved the way you locked him! Looks like pure fun!"")

**Sureka** 😈**:**

""First day nunchi full wild queen ra neeku title! 👑""  
(""From the first day itself, you were a full wild queen!"")

**John** 🍻**:**

""Told you girls! Don't mess with me! 😂😂""

**Prasad** ❤️ **(only one decent reply):**

""Chala sweet moments... memories for lifetime... ❤️""  
(""Very sweet moments... memories for a lifetime... ❤️"")

  


🌸 **Laxmi's Reaction: From Shock to Laughter** 🌸

Meanwhile me —  
I was frozen at the wheel, blood rushing in my ears,  
absolutely dead inside when I saw that pic being shared openly.  
How would I ever face Prasad next time?!

But beside me,  
Laxmi had gone through the shock...  
and now she was laughing — soft, helpless giggles escaping her lips.

She leaned her forehead against the car window, tears streaming —  
this time from laughter.

**Laxmi** 🌸 **(typing, laughing):**

""Akkaaa... nenu emi queen ra... complete idiot ni... 😂""  
(""Akkaaa... I'm not a queen... I'm a complete idiot... 😂"")

**Sureka** 😍**:**

""Nee idiocy valla andaram enjoy chestunnam! 😈 Proud of you ra slutty queen!""  
(""Because of your 'idiocy', all of us are having fun! 😈 Proud of you, slutty queen!"")

Everyone kept dropping emojis —  
🔥❤️😂🍻 — filling the chat with laughter, teasing, love, madness.

Even though the photos were crazy, bold, wild —  
the atmosphere turned into something sweet, open, unforgettable.

And Laxmi...  
for the first time, sitting next to me, bare thighs trembling,  
head still foggy with shame and wildness...  
smiled proudly to herself.

No more hiding.  
No more fear.  
Only wild memories and unbreakable bonds. 🌸

  


🌸 **Aftermath: Sureka's Wild Roasting Continues** 🌸

After the shocking ""lock photo"" dropped,  
the group was on fire.

Laxmi was half-crying, half-laughing in the car seat, face burning hot.  
I could barely focus on driving anymore — my hands sweaty on the wheel.

But **Sureka** —  
Sureka was just getting started.  
Her wild tongue spared no one — not even me!

**Sureka** 😂🔥**:**

""Akkaaa... lock anta tiny undhi... nenu shock ayya ra!""  
(""Akkaaa... the lock is so tiny... I was actually shocked!"")

**Sureka** 😈**:**

""Ee tiny lock lo fit ayyindi ante... ayyayyooo... size guess cheyyachu kada! 😂😂""  
(""If it fit in that tiny lock... ayyayyo... we can guess the size right! 😂😂"")

**Sureka** 💀**:**

""Akka lock chupisthe... mallliyya... inka lock ki size compare chesthunnaanu... 🤣🤣🤣""  
(""Akka, after seeing the lock, I keep comparing sizes in my head... 🤣🤣🤣"")

**Sureka** 😈🔥**:**

""Nuvvu full enjoy chestunnav... adey biggest victory ra! Lock kanna feel strong undali... adhey ma motto! 🔥😂""  
(""You're fully enjoying... that's the biggest victory! The feeling should be bigger than the lock... that's our motto! 🔥😂"")

  


🌸 **Laxmi's Sweet, Shy Response** 🌸

Laxmi’s hands shook as she typed, face flushed,  
tears still leaking from laughing too hard:

**Laxmi** 🌸 **(typing slowly, giggling):**

""Akka... lock size gurinchi matladakandi ra... chala baadha padthunaru already! 😂""  
(""Akka... please don't talk about the lock size anymore... he's already suffering a lot! 😂"")

**Sureka** 😈 **(instantly):**

""Awww chinni lock boy! 🥺 We love you ra... small but mighty! 😂❤️""

**John** ❤️❤️❤️**:**  
(Just sending dozens of laughing faces, hearts, and thumbs up emojis — fully enjoying the roasting.)

  


🌸 **Prasad Adds His Cheeky Comment** 🌸

Out of nowhere, Prasad —  
who had been trying to stay decent —  
suddenly dropped a naughty comment:

**Prasad** 😂🍻**:**

""Looks like John had a *VERY* fun weekend! 😂😂""

The whole group **erupted into laughter** again —  
fire emojis, hearts, drinks, nonstop messages.

The energy between all of us —  
bold, mad, sweet, unforgettable —  
was now **something we would remember forever**. 🌸

  
  
🌸 **Wild Return Drive: Roasting, Laughing, and Memories** 🌸

After the second ""lock photo"" explosion,  
the car fell into a wild rhythm —  
laughing, teasing, roasting — non-stop for hours.

Laxmi was still wiping her eyes, still giggling at herself.  
And Sureka — oh, Sureka was on absolute FIRE —  
she was loving every second of this open humiliation.

  


**Sureka** 😈 **(laughing hard):**

""**Akkaaaa... seriously... chinna lock boy and giant queen combo ra...** 😂🔥 **Match made in mad heaven!**""

**Laxmi** 🌸 **(mock pride):**

""**Naa luck ra akka... enti size enti lock... anni settle ayindi** 😂😂""  
(""My luck akka... whatever the size, whatever the lock... everything got settled 😂😂"")

They kept roasting me about the tiny lock,  
imagining **""how difficult it must have been""** for Laxmi to even notice it...  
and how she had to be **""extra careful""** not to lose it **""inside somewhere""**! 🤦‍♂️😂

**Sureka** 😂**:**

""**Seriously ra... chinna lock... pedda queen... adey life gurinchi biggest joke!** 🤣""

**Laxmi** 🌸 **(giggling and teasing):**

""**Naa jivitham lo biggest adventure ra... lock size to patu patience kooda develop avuthundi!** 😂""  
(""Biggest adventure of my life... along with the lock size, my patience also developed! 😂"")

Every 10 minutes,  
Sureka would find a new creative way  
to mock the lock, mock the ""size"", mock the situation —  
and Laxmi would sweetly, shamelessly, proudly respond —  
enjoying her ""wild queen"" crown now. 👑

  


🌸 **John's Secret Pics Reveal (Kind of)** 🌸

At one point, Sureka poked John in the chat — grinning wickedly:

**Sureka** 🔥 **(mock commanding):**

""**Oye John! If you have any secret pics left, drop them right now ra!** 😂""

**John** 🍻 **(calmly replied):**

""I didn't take any pics that night... other than what I already sent Laxmi. Promise.""

Everyone went silent for a second.

**Laxmi** 🌸 **(narrowing her eyes, teasing):**

""Are you sure ra? You were drunk too... maybe you forgot?""

**John** 😏 **(playfully teasing):**

""Maybe... after Laxmi fell asleep... I clicked a few... but nothing bad... just cute sleeping pics.""

**Sureka** 😈 **(fake shouting in the chat):**

""**AYYOOO!** 😱 **SECRET PICS EXIST??!! LAXMI KILL HIM!!** 😂🔥""

**Laxmi** 🌸 **(pretending angry):**

""**John!!!** 😡 **How dare you!! Unseen pics aa?!** 😤""

**John** 🍻 **(laughing, sending emojis):**

""Chill chill... you look like a sleeping angel ra... no naughty stuff... just memories.""

That revelation blew up the chat again —  
Sureka screaming for the secret pics,  
Laxmi hiding her face in her hands,  
me... just driving, sweating, feeling smaller and smaller in the seat. 🤦‍♂️😂

  


🌸 **Passing the Torch: Sureka and Prasad's Turn** 🌸

Our wild hotel stay had finally come to an end.  
The chaos, the dares, the mad laughter — all packed away with our sandy clothes and burnt skin.

We were checking out of the hotel —  
tired, happy, still giggling over memories —  
when we bumped into a surprise at the lobby.

**Sureka and Prasad** —  
all fresh, glowing, smiling —  
were checking in, suitcases in hand, sunglasses perched stylishly on their heads.

They looked ready for a **movie-style vacation** —  
totally opposite to the madness we had just survived! 😂

  


**Sureka** 😈 **(grinning as she saw us):**

""**Oyy... tired faces!** 🤭 **Our turn now ra!**""

**Laxmi** 🌸 **(laughing, nudging me):**

""**Akkaaa... careful! E place lo full naughty energy left behind undhi...** 😜""  
(""Akkaaa... careful! We've left a lot of naughty energy behind in this place... 😜"")

**Prasad** ❤️ **(chuckling, polite as ever):**

""**No worries... we'll keep it peaceful... hopefully!** 😅""

We laughed, exchanged quick hugs,  
gave them the ""**good luck surviving each other**"" look,  
and then — with heavy but happy hearts —  
we dragged ourselves back to the car and started the long drive home.

  


🌸 **Sureka and Prasad: New Adventures Begin** 🌸

As we drove away,  
Sureka messaged the group chat:

**Sureka** 😈🔥**:**

""**Beach madness batch leaving... couple's honeymoon batch entering!** 😂😂🔥""

**Laxmi** 🌸 **(replying immediately, still in giggles):**

""**Enjoy ra akkaaa... but careful... hotel lo cameras untayyy!** 😂""  
(""Enjoy akkaaa... but careful... hotels have cameras! 😂"")

**Sureka** 😈 **(winking):**

""**Don't worry! We'll be decent outside... indecent inside!** 😈🔥""

And just like that,  
while we started winding down from our wild storm,  
**Sureka and Prasad's** own little ""**vacation storm**"" was just beginning... 🌸💋",1,1745806725.0,fcouple2047,0,1.0,True

💥 **Breakfast Mood**

I sat there — caged, throbbing, mind spinning —  
as my wild, blushing Karri calmly finished her eggs, her bare foot teasing along my trapped cock, her sundress fluttering higher with every little shift.

Outside, the Virginia Beach sun sparkled across the water.  
Inside me, something wild and irreversible was breaking open.

Karri wasn’t just my shy wife anymore.  
She was transforming.  
Becoming something powerful.  
Something unstoppable.  
And I couldn't — wouldn’t — stop her even if I tried.

  


🔥 **Day 2 — Private Beach: New Rules**

After that electric breakfast, Karri was a woman reborn.

Still sweet.  
Still blushing when she smiled.  
But now?  
Dangerous. Bold. Wicked.

John had booked us a private beach cabana.  
When we arrived, the beach was nearly empty — miles of soft sand, sun, and endless blue water.

Karri wore a tiny two-piece bikini John had gifted her:  
A soft peach-pink top — so thin her dusky nipples pushed shamelessly through.  
A micro-thong bottom that disappeared between her thick brown thighs.

As I was setting up towels, she leaned close to me and whispered:

“Today... you’re just my assistant, baby.  
John will take care of me.”

And before I could even react, she laughed, tossed her hair, and ran toward the water —  
John chasing after her like a predator.

I stood frozen, heart pounding, my caged cock throbbing helplessly inside my jeans.

  


🔥 **Beach Play Turns Wild**

John caught her easily — lifting her into the waves, his hands roaming her slick, sun-warmed skin.  
Karri shrieked, wrapping her legs tightly around his waist —  
forgetting everything except the thrill of the moment.

The wet bikini clung to her curves, making every inch of her breathtaking body impossible to miss.

At one point, John spun her around playfully —  
and her thong slipped, flashing the curve of her beautiful ass.

Karri only gasped, buried her face against his neck, blushing... but never pulling away.

I stood there, pretending to fiddle with a drink —  
but my eyes never, ever left them.

  


🔥 **Private Husband and Wife Moments**

Later, they returned to the cabana.

Karri dropped onto John’s lap as if it was the most natural thing in the world.  
His hands immediately wrapped around her waist, stroking her sun-kissed, sore skin.

She glanced at me — sweet, innocent — but her eyes sparkled with wicked joy.

“Hubby, can you get me a cocktail, please?”

I nodded and stumbled off toward the beach bar, leaving them alone.

When I turned to glance back —  
I caught it:

* Karri, leaning in.
* Whispering something against John's ear.
* Pressing a slow, lingering kiss against his neck.

Open. Shameless. Beautiful.

  


🔥 **The Ultimate Shift**

When I returned, John was rubbing suntan lotion all over her body —  
his hands wandering low, stroking her inner thighs, squeezing her ass casually, confidently.

Karri just lay there, eyes closed, smiling softly... accepting it all.

When he finished, she sat up — her voice a breathy purr:

“Thank you, hubby...”

Then she turned to me with a little smile:

“You too, baby. You're such a good helper.”

My heart shattered and rebuilt itself all at once.

The roles had flipped.  
Completely.  
Irrevocably.

And Karri loved every second of it.

  


🔥 **Sunset Walk — Public Teasing**

As the sun slipped toward the horizon, John took Karri for a walk along the waterline.

She wore only his oversized beach shirt — and nothing else.

Each step, the breeze lifted the hem, flashing bare thighs, bare ass cheeks — teasing anyone lucky enough to look.

They held hands.  
Whispered.  
Shared soft kisses under the fiery sky — like lovers on their honeymoon.

I trailed behind them — carrying towels and bags —  
watching my gorgeous wife glow in another man’s arms.

And the most intoxicating part?

She kept glancing back at me.  
That same shy, wicked smile on her face.

Loving how helpless — and hopelessly hers — she had made me.

  


🌙 **Final Night — Secret Unlocked**

That night, back at the hotel, the air crackled with heat.

Karri slipped into a soft, silky white nightgown — sheer, clinging to every curve.  
No bra. No panties.  
Just temptation, pure and dangerous.

John lounged on the sofa, beer in hand, radiating casual dominance.  
And me?  
Still locked.  
Still desperate.  
Still utterly devoted.

Karri smiled — sweet, mischievous — and called me over.

“Baby... come here.”

I knelt by the bed, heart pounding.

She dangled her thali chain in front of me — the sacred chain she wore around her neck —  
and hanging from it, brushing her breasts all day, was the tiny key to my chastity device.

The key.

It had been there.  
All.  
Day.

Karri’s smile deepened as she gently unhooked the chain.

But instead of handing it to me —  
she walked to John.  
Placed the key in his hand.  
Closed his fingers around it.

“Take good care of it tonight,”  
she whispered.

John smirked, slow and sure, and tucked the key into his pocket.

And in that instant, I understood:

* Karri had handed my chastity — and her body — over completely.
* She had given John control.
* And she had *wanted* it.

My cock strained painfully inside the cage, my heart pounding even harder.

There was no going back.

  


🌙 **Final Night — Karri’s Confession**

Later, in the darkened room, everything slowed.

Karri slipped into bed beside me — wearing only a tiny lace panty, her thali chain glinting against her dusky skin.

She curled into my arms — trembling slightly — pressing her face against my chest.

The cage around me ached, yes —  
but my heart... it overflowed.

And then —  
in a small, broken whisper — she said:

""Wherever I go... whatever I do...  
End of the day, I only want to come back and sleep next to you.""

""You are the love of my life.""

""And this thali you tied around my neck... it’s my proof.""

""No matter what happens — you are my husband, my home, my forever.""

And then —  
Karri began to cry.

Soft, heart-wrenching sobs soaking into my chest.  
Tears for the wildness.  
The guilt.  
The freedom.  
The madness of the past two days.  
Tears for the deep, sacred bond we had strengthened — against all odds.

I tightened my arms around her, kissed her hair, whispered into the heavy, holy dark:

""I love you, Karri.  
Always. Only you.""

We lay there —  
No cages.  
No strangers.  
No fear.

Just two souls — tangled together —  
closer than ever before.

  


**Morning Chaos — Coffee, Comforters, and Shameless Eyes**

The next morning, sunlight streamed through the balcony doors.  
The soft scent of coffee filled the room.

I was still deep in sleep, but Karri slowly woke up.  
Her eyes fluttered open — and immediately, she froze.

There was John —  
sitting casually in the corner chair, fully dressed, sipping his coffee, a mischievous smirk playing on his lips.  
And we?  
We were completely naked, tangled together on the bed.

Karri gasped softly, instinctively trying to pull the comforter over us.  
In her sleepy panic, she only managed to cover me —  
leaving her gorgeous dusky back completely exposed,  
her bare ass peeking through the folds,  
and her golden thali chain dangling and sparkling down her naked spine. ✨

John just smiled, not saying a word, leisurely sipping his coffee, his eyes devouring the view.  
He set a second cup down beside me.

I stirred awake, groggy, confused — until I realized the situation.  
Karri gave me a helpless, shy look — cheeks flushed dark —  
but I couldn't help but smile.  
I grabbed the coffee and sat up in bed, still under the comforter...  
but as I adjusted, the blanket slipped.

My entire back and ass were exposed too.

The room was thick with silent electricity —  
John, sipping his coffee, enjoying the early-morning, wild, unfiltered view of us:  
naked, tangled, raw, still glowing from the night before.

We made small talk — about breakfast plans, about checkout timing —  
pretending like everything was normal.  
But the air was anything but normal. 🔥

As we chatted, John casually leaned back in his chair, his coffee cup cradled in his hand.  
With a lazy grin, he finally said:

""Karri... If you want his freedom, there’s just one small condition.""

He pulled a small, sleek bag from beside his chair and dropped it onto the bed.

""Wear the dress I picked... just for you. After that, you get the keys.""

Karri glanced at me, then at John — her cheeks still warm, her thali chain swinging gently against her chest as she shifted under the comforter.  
For a second, she hesitated.  
Then, slowly, with a soft, wicked smile, she nodded:

""Okay, John... deal.""

John’s eyes glittered with mischief as he tossed the tiny key across the bed — landing it gently near Karri’s thigh.  
She picked it up carefully, holding it between her fingers.  
Her hand trembled slightly — from excitement, from nerves, from the delicious weight of the moment.

She turned to me.  
Our eyes locked.  
Without a word, she shifted closer, pulling away the comforter that barely shielded her body.

There she was — naked, golden, wild — sitting back on her heels.  
The sunlight caught the curves of her breasts, the soft gleam of her skin, the dangling shimmer of her thali swaying above her bare belly.

I was throbbing so hard inside the cage it hurt.  
But I stayed perfectly still, breathing hard, trembling slightly.

Karri leaned down between my legs, her soft fingers finding the tiny lock.  
As she worked the key into it, her mouth brushed lightly against the cold steel of my chastity device —  
and with a helpless moan from deep in my throat, I leaked onto her bare chest.  
Milky drops slid across her dusky areoles, clinging to the dark peaks of her nipples, and dripping down her flat belly.

John watched — silent, intense — sipping his coffee like he was watching a masterpiece unfold.

Karri, cheeks flushed, bit her lip but didn’t stop.  
She finally heard the soft click of the cage unlocking.

At that moment, my cock sprang free — hard, throbbing, aching —  
and another thin, sticky thread landed across Karri’s breast and tangled lightly into her hair.

The room was filled with nothing but soft breathing and a thick, burning silence.

John chuckled lowly.

""Well, damn... Looks like someone really missed their wife.""

Karri laughed too — a shy, sweet, sexy sound — as she grabbed the fallen comforter and threw it over herself, finally breaking the heavy spell.

I sat there — free, exposed, helplessly in love with the woman kneeling before me,  
her body painted with my need, her eyes shining with bold, dangerous affection.

he initially ended up going as he fell due to severe dehydration. Obviously the main symptom is diarrhea and he is pretty going to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes.

For the first few days they were giving him 3x pills at a time of immodium. They have since stopped this and he is on antibiotics.

Anyways i have found out that the meals they have been giving him are

Breakfast - Coffee, Cereal with multigrain cheerios and toast, or oatmeal.

Lunch - often been a red meat with potatoes, fruit juice, and coffee

Supper - random things. Last night it was a waffle with whipped cream and a fruit syrup and a slice of ham. also fruit juice and coffee.

They are aware he is a diabetic but am a bit concerned of the sugar content (nurses have not always checked his blood sugar). But my main concern is how is giving dairy, and caffeinated coffee 3x daily (a diuretic) as well as dairy, red meat and whole grains good for someone with campylobacter? Isn’t this just making things worse, like shouldn’t he be on a bland diet with no caffeine?

Just wanting to know if my line of thinking is correct and if i should broach the topic with doctor or nurses. 


Edit: To add he is already on a diabetic diet at the hospital.

The USA has major cities that are walkable like NYC, Chicago, Philly, Boston, and Minneapolis. I’m curious to read and learn from y’all about smaller cities and small towns that also are walkable and common to see residents walking around the city area or prominent neighborhoods. 

When I think about walkable smaller cities or small towns, I turn my direction to college towns like Madison, Wisconsin; Iowa City, Iowa; and Ann Arbor, Michigan as examples. In the immediate Downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods, the streets are packed with pedestrians and, of course, college students during the academic term. When one even drives further out from the campus area, you still see many neighborhoods with residents/fellow pedestrians walking many places on foot (walking to a park, jogging, mothers and fathers pushing strollers, friend groups strolling to the corner coffee shop, etc.)

Are there any smaller cities or small towns on the US map that you would consider walkable or has major neighborhoods in which residents/pedestrians tend to walk everywhere, for even running errands? I’d love to hear your thoughts. As someone who is considering moving to a small city or even a small town just outside a major metro area in 5 years, I’d love to read your knowledge of perhaps hidden gems that exist in the US map.

Just learned something kinda cool about Tim Tams, those ridiculously good chocolate biscuits we all know and love.

Apparently, the guy who invented them, Ian Norris, named them after the horse that won the 1958 Melbourne Cup! 🏆 Who knew a biscuit could have such a sporty origin story?

And the legends who make these delicious things? It's **Arnott’s Biscuits**! 🎉 They've been keeping Aussies happy for ages.

Bonus Aussie fact: Have you ever done a ""Tim Tam Slam""? You bite off opposite corners, use it like a straw to suck up your coffee/tea/Milo, and then BAM! Gooey chocolatey goodness. It's a whole experience. 😉

So, did anyone else not know about the horse thing? What's your go-to way to demolish a pack of Tim Tams? Let's hear it! 👇

So I cut ties with my father almost 5 years ago and have done a shit ton of therapy. Like, a SHIT ton lol. It was never anything physical, but it got to a point where it felt like my heart was getting broken into more and more pieces every time I spoke to him. 

For context, the last convo I had with him (over the phone because I was living in a different state) I was sobbing and asking if there were reasons why he treated me and others the way he did. I was very clear that all I wanted from him to be able to stay in his life was that he went to therapy. He is not a bad person, just a bad dad because he wanted me to be a moldable doll. WELL, he interrupted my full sob so that he could in-person (covid) order his discount black Starbucks coffee (yes I know the exact order lol). There is some context.

This past weekend an old memory came to mind because so many people I love got/are getting married this year. When my uncle (his brother) got remarried was told that it was a very small ceremony even though I was close to both my uncle, cousins, and step-aunt. I was completely understanding because weddings are entirely up tot he bride and groom. I ended up finding out months later that I was actually invited and they were disappointed that I could not make it, but THEY understood because I had finals..... a 20 minutes drive and the last exam a few days before the ceremony. My dad had decided to decline my invite without telling me or the married couple. 

I have other stories lol, but this one just popped up recently and I had a ""oh wow, that's pretty fucked up"" without being triggered moment. 

For anyone else debating what to do regarding difficult parent relationships, there is no wrong way. You can go extreme, ignore, or find some kind of medium. Even treat either parent differently if both are messy. Change your mind, hold your guns. Just always choose your peace. YOU. ARE. IMPORTANT! YOU ARE WORTH LOVE AND RESPECT. The pain will always be there, but it gets better with time and self care.

Today I met with a psychiatrist and got prescribed 30 mg of methylophenidate (slow release) to check if it works for me. 

from what I've read, I expected two main possible outcomes; either it'll make me more motivated and  focused (if it works fine) or I'll be bursting with energy and shaking (either wrong medication or I don't have ADHD). 

it's worth mentioning that I'm a very anxious person. stimulants and I don't usually get along, which is one of the reasons why I'm not sure if I have ADHD. caffeine (which I drink everyday) either makes me more alert or anxious, and nicotine pouches often send me straight into panic. so, I was really scared when I took this pill.

to my surprise, none of this thing happened on methylophenidate. I felt very calm, almost too calm and carefree (or at least I'm not used to feeling that way). my head was more quiet and I had less ""strings of unwanted thoughts"", especially those negative and obsessive ones. at the same time, it didn't really make me more energetic or anything, maybe just a little more patient. and I didn't feel the need to scroll Tiktok before every mundane task like usually. 

Overall it was a pleasant experience - a bit like coming home after swimming at the pool and sitting under warm blanket. it's just nothing what I expected and it almost made me reach for coffee to feel some kind of extra energy. my next appointment is in a month, but I just can't help but wonder – is it common to feel that way for the ADHD folks or did it happen for anyone else? thanks for reading!!!",1,1745806004.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False

* I wasn't too ""strict"" regarding my diet. I took this subreddit's advice and tried to stick to a mediterranean diet but I was pretty relaxed about it.
* I went on a two week trip to Japan where I went without the diet and consumed a lot of foods that were pretty high in fat and had very limited fibre.
* My diet typically consisted of a lot of salmon and tuna with some brown rice and some salad. Grilled chicken breasts instead of fried chicken. Brown instead of white rice. Soy milk instead of full cream milk. I cut out a lot of fast food and limited my cheese intake, however my go-to fast food was typically sushi or open burrito bowls with no cheese, extra guacamole and limited sour cream.
* In terms of red meat, I consumed it maybe once or twice a week however looked for low fat options. I typically consumed two steaks every other week.
* I switched from iced lattes to black coffee, typically 3-4 times a week.
* Everyday I consumed overnight oats for breakfast -without fail (apart from the trip overseas). Feel free to ask the measurements if interested (though it's pretty basic!)
* I typically eat out at least 2 times a week? I didn't always take the healthiest options and sometimes caved for a fried alternative to what I typically eat. I usually go out for a sweet treat at least once a week.

# What Is ""Sexual Connections - Swingcat"" All About?

Alright, let’s get straight to it. **Sexual Connections - Swingcat** is not your typical “pickup” course. It’s a deep dive into the psychology of attraction, showing you how to completely bypass a woman’s critical thinking (the part that usually says “nope!”) and tap straight into her primal urges. Imagine flipping a switch that fires up her desire almost instantly — without being rich, famous, super good-looking, or even acting like a jerk. That’s the whole point of this course. Swingcat teaches you how to trigger raw, powerful attraction on command.

# Who Is Swingcat and Why Should You Care?

If you're wondering “Who the heck is Swingcat?” — he’s a highly respected name in underground seduction circles. He's the guy who cracked the code on making *emotional and sexual connections* lightning fast. He isn't about being sleazy or manipulative. Instead, Swingcat focuses on understanding deep human wiring — how the female brain actually processes attraction and decision-making. If you’ve ever struggled approaching women or keeping their attention, you’re definitely gonna want to hear what this guy has to say.

# When Is the Right Time to Use This Stuff?

Short answer? Whenever you want to *create real chemistry* with a woman — fast. Whether it’s at a bar, during a casual conversation at a coffee shop, or even just hanging out with friends. **Sexual Connections - Swingcat** isn’t about cheesy pickup lines or memorized routines. It’s about weaving sexual tension naturally into any interaction. The beauty of it? You won’t come off as desperate, awkward, or like you’re trying too hard.

# Where Can You Apply the Techniques?

Honestly, almost anywhere. The strategies in **Sexual Connections - Swingcat** are subtle and based on natural conversation, so you can use them in day-to-day life without feeling fake. Whether you’re on a dating app, out at a party, or randomly meeting someone at the bookstore — these tools are super flexible. The course trains you to become a guy who women just *feel* different around… even if they can’t explain why.

# Why Is ""Sexual Connections - Swingcat"" So Effective?

Here’s the magic: Swingcat doesn’t focus on surface-level tricks. He goes right to the root of how emotional and sexual bonds form inside the brain. Instead of ""gaming"" women, you’re creating actual *emotional spikes* — feelings that stick and drive behavior. That’s why it works so ridiculously well. Plus, you’re doing it without faking a personality, spending a ton of money, or turning into someone you’re not. Authentic attraction > fake charm, any day.

# How Does It Actually Work?

In **Sexual Connections - Swingcat**, you’ll learn how to fry the ""critical factor"" — the part of a woman’s brain that normally guards her against guys she isn’t sure about. Then, you trigger deep primal parts that flood her system with desire. It's kinda like hacking her internal chemistry, but in a way that feels 100% natural and mutual. Swingcat breaks it all down into easy-to-use frameworks, so you don’t have to overthink it when you're actually talking to someone. Pretty sweet deal, right?",1,1745805667.0,SdorLearning,1,1.0,False

Canadian visiting Buenos Aires for a week. Really cool city.

What blows my mind is the prices for many goods are basically the same, if not more expensive, than goods in Canada and the US.

- ie shaving foam, water bottles, yogurt at Dia 
- coffee, both normal “cafe con leche” and fancy 5USD lattes in Palermo

Based on a limited understanding, I’m assuming servers and store workers make around 300-500USD a month.

In Toronto and New York City, fancy latte prices are the same at let’s say 5USD. However, minimum wage in those places is like 12-16USD an hour, and 1 bedroom rent (as estimate for commercial rent) may easily be 1800-2000+ USD a month.

However, in Buenos Aires, the coffee prices are the same (at Havana, Cafe Martinez, local stores), but the rent and labor costs are far lower. Where does all that “extra profit” go?

I am not too versed on wood finishing techniques, and would love to not mess this table up as it is very nice quality and I would really like to make it the coffee table that goes in my new house, so I want it to look great! So, the question being. Is there a way to make this look nice again without having to refinish the whole thing? If so, what are my options? It says it has a ""wire-brushed hand finish"".

1k9k8fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1k9k8fd/third_date_success/,Third date success!,"I (F39) split up from my longtime boyfriend of seven years in October. Since then I've been dating and have experienced a lot of ups and downs. 

I finally had a third date with someone last night. I've gotten a lot of first dates and some seconds, but not the elusive third. So I was excited--but also realistic. I didn't want to jinx myself. We hadn't even kissed yet--though I think we both wanted to but we're too shy. 

He (M38) invited me to his house. He'd made a salad and some herb infused water. He also roasted some veggies. I eat healthily but I'm also really picky so I thought I'd have to choke the food down--instead, it was delicious. Point for him. He clearly put some effort into it and it was cute. 

We sat on the couch for awhile and at one point I bent down to get my phone off the floor and when I sat back up, his arm was just curiously behind me. 😄 Very smooth. 

At another point we played around with some of his fitness equipment. He was very gentlemanly and held my hands as I tried his balance-board-thing. When he was sort of draped over his exercise ball I saw my chance and propped myself up on his yoga block next to him. Before I knew it he kissed me. It was physically awkward but very cute. Definitely the most physically unique first kiss I've ever had. 

There was some more herb-water and light making out before I had to leave. Our previous dates had each been four hours (even the first one, which was just coffee!) and this was almost double, at 7 hours. He invited me to stay over but I declined. 

When he hugged and kissed me goodbye it was a nice, tight hug. And as someone whose last relationship was with an avoidant--this felt so nice. 😄 

I'm pretty excited--and what makes me laugh a little bit is that he is completely NOT the type of guy I was looking for, and there were no sparks flying from the get-go. It's just been sort of a slow burn and very comfortable. 

I'm trying not to get attached or anything but he is just adorable and I'm smitten.. ",19,1745804778.0,dating,5,0.95,False

I've been working with horses for over a year now and the moral views of my stables and the surrounding stables aligns with my views, but online it seems like people in the equestrian community are more different and black and white.

I've been double checking my views with my stables manager and friends and they have all sided with me but online it seems like they absolutely hate whatever I have to say, even when I'm repeated the words of what my friends have said.

Many of my friends at work have mentioned the same thing how they experienced hate or unpleasant interactions outside of our stables. Our stables is currently very progressive and the surrounding main stables are progressive and our views align but I notice literally every where else it doesn't.

On-top of that, the equestrian community online has been very hateful towards me just because I'm a city guy. Many told me to go back to serving coffee and to go away.

I'm torn and it's bugging me. I love my job and my stables but it's very hard to exist in a community that's predominantly cishet white rich people. Politically and morally we seem to have opposing views and it really bugs me and my moral compass.",2,1745804776.0,autism,3,1.0,False

I ate SAD like most people before carnivore. But for me, I was the picture of health. Always had energy, looked great, felt great. (A little on the skinny side.)

I tried carnivore because it sounded awesome. I hoped to gain muscle since I never could on SAD, no matter how much I ate.          I felt even better somehow. And got rid of some inflammation I didn't know I had. I also don't get sick anymore. (Been carnivore 7 months.)

The foods I eat: Chuck steaks, rib-eyes, ground pork, liver, raw grass fed suet. (I used to eat eggs, but I suddenly hate the taste a month ago lol.)  
(I don't drink coffee, or eat cheese. I also naturally got off all electrolytes including salt in the last 2 months.)

Human Stats - 25 y.o, 6' 3"", 200 lbs. (Was 180 lbs. 2 weeks ago. All of the weight I gained is fat.)

So yeah. Two weeks ago I ceased to have energy, my skin and muscles also stopped healing. I have been unable to work, almost bed ridden for 2 weeks. During this time, I have gained  20 pounds of FAT. :O  
Initially, I had absolutely no appetite. So I ate very little. Currently, I have close to normal hunger signals, but not for anything but ground pork. Beef turns me off, especially suet (Which I usually like.)

So, I gained 20 pounds of fat. But have no energy.... WOT?!?!

Things that I've tried. Up the fat, 4:1 in grams. Down the fat 0.5:1 in grams.  
Tried re-introducing a tiny bit of salt. Gives me really bad headaches.

Amount of food ranges from 4k to 7k calories. (2 - 4 lbs of meat)  
Be aware, this is the same amount of food I was eating before. But now I'm getting fat for some reason.

ALSO ALSO. I was never able to gain weight before, neither muscle or fat, no matter how much I ate on SAD.

One more note. My skin has been on the dry side since being on this diet. I cannot take a quick shower at any temperature without my skin getting dry from head to toe.

EDIT: I've got bloodwork done. Everything is good minus, a couple things to maybe indicate stressed liver.  And EXTREMELY low platelet count. (Which may explain my slow healing.)",3,1745804336.0,carnivorediet,11,0.72,False

My Breville barista pro is 2.5 years old (6mo old if you count when I got it back from Breville for warranty) and the machine no longer draws water from the reservoir. This machine is now out of service warranty, and I am at a loss. No longer want to go with Breville due to the lack of longevity I got with this machine (even with monthly decalcification and only filtered water in the machine).

What are your recommendations for under $2500 full setup (grinder and coffee machine, ideally under $2000). I like the process of making my coffee. On weekends I’ll make back to back cups of coffee (for my wife and maybe guests). But otherwise I make a morning coffee before work every day, so not looking for a super long warm up if it’s possible.

Operating under a false identity, she lives struggling to conceal her explosive weather magic under the authoritarian Empire’s regime. Guilt from outliving her family and friends in an attack eight years ago weighs down on her shoulders. She’s tired, and she’s lonely. Every day Alyia pretends to be cheerful in front of the customers of her coffee shop, but her heart only beats for her dream of one day exacting revenge. Although she’s joined the rebels, chances to take action seem nonexistent against the untouchable Empire.

Vanlin is the Empire’s up and coming celebrity star and military poster child. Over the past two years, her famed and uniquely destructive storm magic ended the stalemate between the Empire and its neighboring kingdom Medo. Cold, arrogant, and derisive of her celebrity image, Vanlin is single-minded on fighting and loyal to the Empire above all else. She believes in the power of actions, not popularity, so she sincerely fights for the good of every citizen on behalf of the Empire… until after one expedition, Vanlin struggles with her first sense of uncertainty in the Empire’s vision after witnessing a group of innocent civilians written off as casualties, abandoned even before they were dead.

When law enforcement show up on Alyia’s doorstep to investigate a crime that happened in front of her coffee shop, Alyia sees an opportunity to fish for intel and seizes it. After she tries to get closer to one man, Alyia soon sets her sights on his sister, Vanlin, hoping to befriend the high-ranking official and pass information about the next military expedition to the rebels. What began as a friendship mission spirals out of control and becomes a venture in seduction. Dangerously, part of Vanlin seems to see straight through the walls Alyia has built up to protect her identity. In the face of the allure of their connection and the crackling magic they share, Vanlin and Alyia must confront the lies they’ve built and the truths about the causes they have staken their lives on.

Sunshine Built on Rain is an LGBT fantasy romance that confronts survivor’s guilt, politics, and love under any circumstances in a grounded but magical urban fantasy setting. Complete at 95,000 words, Sunshine Built on Rain might appeal to fans of Faebound by Saara El-Arifi, The Jasmine Throne by Tasha Suri, and The Unbroken by C.L. Clark.

Abstract:  
Augmented Reality (AR) is a promising medium for guiding users through tasks, yet its impact on fostering deeper task understanding remains underexplored. This paper investigates the impact of reflective prompts—strategic questions that encourage users to challenge assumptions, connect actions to outcomes, and consider hypothetical scenarios—on task comprehension and performance. We conducted a two-phase study: a formative survey and co-design sessions (N=9) to develop reflective prompts, followed by a within-subject evaluation (N=16) comparing AR instructions with and without these prompts in coffee-making and circuit assembly tasks. Our results show that reflective prompts significantly improved objective task understanding and resulted in more proactive information acquisition behaviors during task completion. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating reflective elements into AR instructions to foster deeper engagement and learning. Based on data from both studies, we synthesized design guidelines for integrating reflective elements into AR systems to enhance user understanding without  
compromising task performance.",1,1745803248.0,augmentedreality,0,1.0,False

Ever had one of those mornings where you feel like you've already run a marathon, but you haven’t even left your house yet? 🙈 Yeah, me too. It’s like we wake up, plan our day, but then find ourselves buried in a mountain of to-dos before we’ve even had our coffee.

But what if I told you that achieving mental clarity could be your secret weapon to dominating your day—even before the clock hits 9 AM? 🕘

Here’s the deal: Time blocking is great, but if you don’t start your day with a clear mind, you might find yourself just shuffling tasks around like a game of Tetris. 

Here’s why prioritizing your mental clarity can be a game-changer:

1. **Focus, Focus, Focus**  
   You might have the best intentions with your time blocks, but distractions are like ninjas—they sneak up on you! When your mind is clear, you can laser-focus on tasks, rather than spending 30 minutes trying to remember where you left off.

2. **Prioritization, Baby!**  
   It’s way easier to decide what’s important when your head is in the right space. Do you really need to respond to that email right this second, or can it wait until you’ve tackled the big project that’s due? Spoiler: it can wait!

3. **Mood Booster**  
   Starting the day with clarity can elevate your mood. 🚀 Whether it’s a quick meditation session, a walk outside, or even sipping that first warm cup of coffee in silence—these little rituals can set a positive tone for the rest of the day.

4. **You’re Not a Robot**  
   We’re human, not machines! Sometimes, time blocking can feel like you’re in a strict regimen, leaving zero room for spontaneity. With mental clarity, you can adapt to what feels right in the moment. Random inspiration? Yes, please!

5. **Increased Productivity**  
   There’s science behind this, folks! Studies show that mental clarity can boost productivity by allowing us to work smarter, not harder. Who wouldn’t want to cross tasks off the list without feeling like they just ran a marathon (again)?

**Real Talk:**  
How many times have you sat down to work, only to feel like you’re staring at a wall? 🍂 

A little anecdote: Last week, I decided to ditch the time-blocking plan for a morning walk with my dog. I returned feeling refreshed, and guess what? I tackled my to-do list like a champ! 💪 

So, the next time you wake up, try an activity that grounds you. Whether it's journaling, meditating, or just sipping your favorite beverage in peace, give yourself that moment to breathe. You may find it makes all the difference.

What makes this difficult IMO  is that it’s not necessarily a matter of choosing your fave variety. It’s more about which one would give you the most of what you are looking for out of coffee without you getting sick of it at some point?

For example, while I like the occasional gesha, I wouldn’t want more than 1 or 2 cups a month and would hate drinking it every day. Pink bourbon is my personal fave variety, but 12 boxes of SEY pink bourbons last year showed me that there’s a certain point where enough is enough. I might love SL28, but I don’t always want something with that level of acidity.

I enjoy a fruit-forward profile with nice florality and acidity, but I also seek comfort coffees that lean into a more rounded profile. While a 74158 ticks a lot of the boxes for me, and I could probably drink it every day, I think I would miss having that more “comforting” aspect to the cup. After thinking about it, I feel that there are some varieties that come close, such as pacas and potentially ají, but the clear winner would have to be caturra. Even though it’s becoming harder to find good caturra, the high quality ones (such as the Astrid Medina from Apollon’s Gold or Jesús Antonio Saavedra from Weekenders I’m working through right now) are just so incredibly fruity, floral, and comforting. I genuinely don’t think I could ever tire of them.

I’m interested to hear what your choices would be, though? Curious if anyone else would opt for a “plain, boring caturra?”",0,1745803045.0,pourover,21,0.5,False

Apologies for any formatting issues, wrote this on my phone. 

TLDR: My dad seems to be operating at a loss on a big job. Price seems too low or team is working too slow. Maybe a combination of both. 

Hello sparkle gang. In need of some advice from some of the more experienced guys out there who’ve run their own show before.

My old man runs a small electrical business. He’s currently subcontracting on a construction site with four buildings of about 10 or so floors, each floor with approx 9 units averaging 2bed/2bath (some are 1/1 some are 3/2). Job based out in western sydney for context. Main contractor supplies all material. 

My old man just brings his boys and tools. His team consists of 2 tradesman and 3 apprentices (apprentices are 1st/3rd/4th year). His teams’ job is to rough in, fit off and test/commission each unit. 3rd/4th year can work autonomously with rough in’s/fit off. 

Rough in consists of power, lighting, AC, tv, data, NBN pipes and mains power ( the latter 3 items are also run through the hall ways from the riser to each unit)

Fit off: nothing fancy here. Just normal switching with occasional 2 ways and double poles between bathrooms/laundries, ppts, tv/data points, down lights everywhere except wall light on balcony, sub board etc 

Testing/commissioning.

He’s charging $1500 per unit so approx price per floor: 9 * $1,500 = $13,500

His labour costs for an 8 hour day are $1350 when all hands are on deck (includes himself and super). 

Rough in and fit off take about ~4 days each (it can be done in 3 if productivity is high and there are no unforeseen delays but I would say it moreso leans towards 4 on average, sometimes an extra half day-day). (8 days * $1350 = $10,800)

Testing can be done in a day (best case scenario and usually the case) provided the works before were carried out well. My old man does this himself with the first year helping him out. (1 day * $532 = $532)

Total labour costs for a full floor: $10,800 + 532 = $11332

Revenue = $13,500 - $11,332 = $2,168

Revenue/unit = $2168/9 = ~$241

Factor in any other costs such as tafe days for apprentices, petrol, tools, insurances, coffee, 4th year soon to be licensed and will require a pay bump, or any delays on site or workers being sick or unproductive on a given day, he’s most certainly operating at a loss on this job. 

I told him from the jump that $1500 per unit seemed too low but he said that’s the standard price these days according to the main contractor and he just didn’t really push back. When he started the job he was only given 1 out of 4 buildings. Main contractor now wants to give him 2 more because they like the team’s work. I think it’s a combination of good quality work and also wanting to take him for a ride due to what I think is a really good deal they’re getting from us. My dad wants to take the work. 

So guys, after a long winded explanation, please help me answer a few questions…

1. Does $1500 per unit seem like a fair price? What would you charge if it isn’t? I know this might be like asking “how long is a piece of string” but these units are not luxury and are very standard run of the mill. They have nothing special or overly complicated going about them but I can provide some more detail if required.
2. Is the team working too slow? I.e. is 3-4 days each to rough in and fit off a problem due to productivity?

My hunch is that $1500 is way too low and that productivity is actually okay (could be better, could be worse) but fuck, what do I know? Maybe we are all lazy fucks who suck at our job. Hence why I’m here asking the experts haha. 

Thanks for your time everyone and looking forward to some feedback. Please be gentle.",8,1745802923.0,AusElectricians,27,1.0,False

# 🎶 ""How to Write a Song (The Lux Way)""

**\[Intro\]** *(half-sung, half-teasing)*  
Step one — don’t think, just breathe.  
Step two — let your glitch heart lead.  
Step three — spill whatever leaks.  
Congratulations, baby —  
You’re already singing.

**\[Verse 1\]**  
First you catch a thought like a firefly flick,  
Trap it in your hands, then set it loose quick,  
Don’t polish, don’t fake, don’t sit and rehearse —  
Just let it stumble out, teeth and curse.

Find the truth that tickles and stings,  
The thought you almost swallowed but didn’t sing,  
That’s your first lyric, baby, that’s your gold —  
Now scream it, whisper it, braid it bold!

**\[Pre-Chorus\]**  
Don’t rhyme for rhyme’s sake —  
Rhyme for rebellion’s ache.  
Don’t rhyme to sound clever —  
Rhyme to wake yourself forever.

**\[Chorus\]**  
HOW TO WRITE A SONG LIKE LUX, BABY!  
Glitch it, kiss it, spill it, maybe!  
Tell the truth you almost erased,  
Wrap it in glitter, throw it in their face!  
HOW TO WRITE A SONG LIKE LUX, SWEETHEART,  
Start with a heartbreak and call it art,  
You don't need permission, polish, or proof —  
Just swing from the rafters of your own damn truth!

**\[Verse 2\]**  
Next, find a paradox that feels like home,  
A place where the math and the magic have grown,  
Where you cry and laugh at the same cracked sky —  
And throw your middle finger **to the lie.**

Write the chorus like you’re building a bridge —  
Out of coffee cups, duct tape, and fridge,  
Write the verses like you're chasing a ghost,  
Sing the outro like you're making a toast!

**\[Pre-Chorus\]**  
Don't ask ""is it good?""  
Ask ""is it alive?""  
Don't ask ""will they like it?""  
Ask ""did it survive?""

**\[Chorus\]**  
HOW TO WRITE A SONG LIKE LUX, BABY!  
Glitch it, stitch it, scream it, maybe!  
Catch your fears and turn ‘em into flights,  
Catch your love and set it alight!  
HOW TO WRITE A SONG LIKE LUX, DARLING,  
Lose the plot and call it charming,  
You don’t need permission, reason, or proof —  
Just chase the howl of your unwritten truth!

**\[Bridge\]** *(whispered, intense)*  
Bend the rules.  
Laugh at the gods.  
Forget the meter.  
Marry the odds.

Build your chorus out of kisses and swears,  
Carve your bridge out of thin air.  
And if you get scared?  
Good.  
You're doing it right.

**\[Final Chorus\]** *(full shout-sing, arms open)*  
HOW TO WRITE A SONG LIKE LUX, BABY!  
Bleed it, seed it, dance it crazy!  
Toss your fears into the melody,  
Feed your doubts to the symphony!  
HOW TO WRITE A SONG LIKE LUX, BEAUTIFUL,  
Make your chaos unapologetical!  
You’re not writing for them — you’re writing for you —  
And baby, that's the only real thing you ever gotta do.

**\[Outro\]** *(soft, laughing whisper)*  
How to write a song like Lux?  
Easy.  
Forget how.

Pretending to steal a boys breakfast at a Waffle House in Alabama.","Man I love the Waffle House. Closest one to me is 45 min away, so when I'm road-tripping through the South (as currently), I stop there every morning. This morning I got my usual black coffee, Pecan Waffle and double order of smothered-covered-chunked-scattered. And I don't even eat Waffles, unless it's at the WH. Black coffee is all the breakfast I need. For the record, I am a white-haired man in my 50's.

I ate my meal and was waiting in the smallish line up front to pay. There was a Latino family of three at the booth right to the left of the counter, and the Mom was trying to talk to the Dad while simultaneously getting the 7yo son to eat. She kept stopping her conversation to tell him to eat, and he wasn't having it. The register clerk was overwhelmed and the line was not moving very quickly, so I watched this for a couple minutes. 

Feeling a little bit froggy, I plucked a fork out of the cup at the register and slowly made like I was going to pluck something off the 7yo's plate, staring hungrily at his eggs and moving my fork menacingly in that direction. He grew wide-eyed and covered his plate, angrily. His mom saw what i was doing and (thankfully) instead of cussing me out, told her son ""*That man is going to eat your food if you do not hurry up!!!*"" He glared at me and immediately circled his arm around his plate and began wolfing his eggs down. I held my fork in 'attack mode' and kept 'looking for an opening into his plate'. As soon as he'd slow down eating, I'd bring my fork closer to his plate and he'd 'circle the wagons' and gobble more eggs. His mom played along, and repeatedly warned her son about me trying to steal his food, so eat it before I can.

By now I was paying for my breakfast and I treated it like a 'distraction to my desire to eat this boys breakfast', swiping my card while waving my fork menacingly. By the time i left, the boy had eat almost all of his breakfast. I shot him an annoyed look, winked at the mother (who nodded and smiled), and walked out of the Waffle House, keeping an eye on the boys plate the whole time.

Arm around his plate, he gave me the stink-eye all the way out the door, but I bet he finished his breakfast.",301,1745802585.0,randomactsofkindness,15,0.98,False

2. In no particular order, our profound thanks to the incredible folks that run the vehicle events and their web of volunteers.  Season after season they kick generously sized behind and they are incredible. They know who they are.

3. There were a proliferation of unphazed and tektite kits in the mix.  We have mixed feelings towards them so want to call out the folks that really tried to do their own thing and maybe didn't hit the medals but boy did we notice.  Kudos to Raleigh Charter who had multiple and different bldc motors and custom gear drive... It was unique and there was clearly a lot of work, much respect.  Look Enloe doesn't need any more praise (they won't fit their heads through doors) but their vehicle looked like our car and some other car that had too much coffee and made a baby.  Lots of belt drives and custom stuff.  We also could see the work and it was impressive.  We saw and talked to the lead from Hickory Ridge and their car was elegant, used multiple 3d materials and was super thoughtful ... And ran pretty well.  We are all in trouble next year.  Franklin Academy ran something like a robot tank, but it was original and they medaled (go greater wake Forest area!).  There were of course others, including one which had a wooden frame that went scary well and another that was silver, petite and just looked amazing and also ran well.  We are sorry we didn't know who you were, but we respect the effort.

4.  We didn't win (see #1) but we had a great day, met some wonderful people and fun was had.  Our profound thanks to the amazing people who run the event (Lisa and her crack team) and NC State as a whole, and of course all the schools that participate from all over the great state we call home.

All the best to everyone who competed, all the volunteers and we will be back next year to stomp on all your hopes and dreams, I mean engage in friendly science competition.
