This past summer I noticed stone fruit (nectarine, peach, and mango) making my lips swell and throat itchy. I stopped eating them, but have tried half of a peach peeled and microwaved and it was okay.

I’m okay to avoid raw stone fruit, but have recently noticed soy milk - hot in a latte, or cold - causing mouth itching! 

The symptoms are less than with stone fruit, but as a vegetarian, soy makes up a huge part of my diet, so I’m quite upset. Tofu is okay for now with no symptoms, and soy sauce too (although it’s always made my cheeks flush), but will this get worse and take away my beloved tofu?? Is it safe to try a splash of soy milk in coffee? How can I prevent it from getting worse? Feeling despair at what the future might hold. ",1,1760623858.0,FoodAllergies,1,1.0,False

(and other Italian roasters)","Hey y'all, I've been trying a variety of roasters from Italy as of late, and I'd like to to see what others think about them:

a. Nero Scuro

b. CaffeLab

c. His Majesty the Coffee

d. Edo Quarta

So far my favourites are Nero Scuro and His Majesty the Coffee, I think in terms of quality they roast and select the most consistently. Nero Scuro also seems to update their selection quite often as well which I think is good? Though as of late they really seem to like fermented coffee.

CaffeLab is hard to judge cause I ordered my coffee from them the most when I was still learning how to make decent brews with specialty coffee, but in terms of value they are prolly among the best in Italy. I've got most of my coffee gear from them too since their prices are better than Amazon. 

I don't have much to say about Edo Quarta, I think their roast is generally a bit darker than I'd like, so I've only ordered from them once, but they had sugarcane decaf which was awesome.

There's other I've tried but these four are the ones I was thinking about the most.

Anyway, thoughts?

Just want to introduce my self as the owner of TAPCO Premier Auto Repair!,"Hey Birmingham fam! My name is Michael Lee and I own TAPCO Premier Auto Repair in Southside! First off I want to say thank you for the many years of recommendations that come from Reddit and our Birmingham community! It is truly impressive how strong and valuable this community is, so again, THANK YOU!

Quick run down on my shop for those interested, I started this shop in April of 2013, in the same location in southside I am still at. I put together every penny I had with no outside help and just took the leap. Why? Because I was sick of working at the dealer and other shops where customers were being lied to and taken advantage of. I knew I could do better for the people around me, and wanted to put my knowledge to work. It has worked pretty well and the business has grown larger than I would have ever expected! To this day, me and my wife do a lot of work inside the business on a daily basis, even though you may not see me behind the desk, I am always doing what I can to help improve the customer experience and continue to grow our employees. 

I have passed my values and procedures to my small staff of 8 people and they are all well trained, super friendly, honest professionals that deliver exceptional quality to you. The idea of my shop is when you walk in our door, that the stress of car repair and headache of dealing with a shop goes away. Greeted with bright lights, a friendly staff, and unlimited drinks, snacks, Wi-Fi bar, and a comfortable couch to relax on - the vibe is not your normal automotive shop vibe. 

Our repair process is a little different, as every car gets a digital inspection and gets sent to you for review. Our goal is to handle your issues and maintenance first, but also give you a bill of health of your vehicle overall  with pictures and videos. This can be viewed as an upsell tactic to some, but really we are just informing you on what all we visibly see wrong with the key components of your vehicle so you can make smart and informed decisions. We will walk you through the process start to finish and help you make the best decisions for your vehicle. At the end of the day, we want customers to know what is going on with their vehicle, and not force selling work to customers. Our highly skilled technicians still blow me away every day with their knowledge and work ethic, and even though they are amazing, every car we service still gets a full quality inspection from a separate team member to ensure we are delivering the best quality work we can to you, the customer. 

We do understand that parts fail and us as humans make mistakes sometimes, but we are always here to stand behind our repairs and service. It can be frustrating for you if you ever have to return back to our shop, and if it is frustrating for you, its 10x more frustrating for us and we will do everything we can to get you fixed back up and going in the quickest way possible. Our customers are priority and we want to keep you and your vehicle's happy!

Hopefully you made it through that, but just wanted to again say thank you to the Birmingham community and the Reddit community for trusting TAPCO for 12 years! We are here to serve our community now, and for many years to come. If you have had an experience with us, we would love to hear about it! This business feeds a lot of family's and supports a lot of community activities around the metro area. We are truly grateful for Birmingham!

Hope to see you around at the shop! Stop by for an oil change, a free brake inspection, or even a new engine - we got you covered. If you are just driving by, stop in and say hey and check us out. The coffee is on us!

How Brian Niccol’s Starbucks is brewing a bold new era where AI predicts your latte, remodels your café, and revives the “third place” experience.

https://preview.redd.it/pw64fjfwdhvf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d748f66cc9e4e630cc82930ab04c74d58e2342

When Brian Niccol, Starbucks’ CEO, walked onto the stage at Salesforce’s Dreamforce event in San Francisco, the crowd expected talk of coffee, culture, and maybe the company’s new protein lattes. What they got instead was a glimpse into the future of retail, a future where artificial intelligence doesn’t just assist the barista — it becomes one.

In a conversation with Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi, Niccol peeled back the lid on a quietly brewing revolution inside Starbucks: a secret AI-powered barista assistant known internally as “Green Dot.” Designed to predict customer orders and streamline operations behind the counter, this digital brain represents the company’s next big bet — one that could redefine the world’s largest coffee chain from the inside out.

**A Year of Reinvention**

Niccol, who took the reins of Starbucks in 2023, didn’t walk into a cozy café of contentment. He inherited a complex, global enterprise facing rising costs, digital strain, and a consumer slowdown that left even loyal latte drinkers thinking twice before tapping “order.” In his first year, the former Chipotle chief has been on a mission to re-caffeinate the brand. Over a thousand stores are being remodeled, underperforming locations shuttered, and the menu overhauled with trendy additions like protein-infused coffee and “craft energy” drinks.

“We’re going back to being a great customer service company,” Niccol told Sozzi. “It’s about bringing back the human connection, the personalization, the craft.”

But it’s the quiet work behind the scenes — the digital reengineering of how Starbucks runs — that might be his boldest move yet.

**The Rise of the AI Barista**

At the heart of Starbucks’ technological push lies “Green Dot,” an AI-driven assistant that helps store managers and baristas handle everything from drink prep to troubleshooting equipment. Niccol describes it as “a fast way to get the right answer,” a digital co-worker that whispers the next best step before a human even asks for help.

The Green Dot project isn’t just a gimmick. It’s part of a wider transformation that includes AI-powered forecasting, smarter inventory systems, and “Smart Queue” technology that prioritizes drink orders in real time. Imagine a system that can anticipate a morning rush, balance workloads across multiple access modes — drive-thru, delivery, counter, and mobile — and ensure your drink is ready the moment you step in. That’s the Starbucks Niccol envisions.

And yes, the AI is learning to remember you. Niccol hinted that the Starbucks app could soon use predictive intelligence to anticipate orders before you even open it. “You might just tell your phone, ‘I’ll be there in 10 minutes,’ and your drink will be ready,” he said. The idea sounds futuristic, but in a company that already runs one of the largest digital loyalty programs in the world, it’s not far-fetched.

**A Balancing Act Between Robots and Humanity**

The big question, of course, is whether AI will replace the human touch that made Starbucks what it is. Niccol was clear on that point: “We just put more partners back into our stores to give people a great experience. Not robotic. Real people, real craft.”

Starbucks isn’t chasing full automation. It’s chasing augmentation — using technology to make employees faster, smarter, and more focused on customers. The AI barista doesn’t pour the espresso, but it might make sure the machine never breaks down during the morning rush. It won’t hand you your latte, but it might tell your barista how to make it faster and better.

Niccol’s philosophy mirrors what’s happening across industries. AI isn’t replacing workers, it’s reshaping what they do. At Starbucks, that means freeing baristas from back-end chaos so they can deliver the “third place” experience — that sense of belonging between home and work — that the company built its empire on.

**From Chipotle to Coffee: A Playbook for Turnaround**

Before Starbucks, Niccol earned his reputation as the man who saved Chipotle from its E. coli crisis and turned it into a digital juggernaut. He introduced a disciplined innovation process known as “stage-gate,” where new menu items are tested, refined, and scaled based on feedback.

Now, he’s applying the same method to Starbucks. The protein latte — already a hit among health-conscious customers — started as a small pilot in five stores before rolling out nationwide. The idea is simple: learn fast, fix faster, scale only when perfect.

That approach is now seeping into every corner of the business. From menu design to supply chain logistics, Starbucks under Niccol is becoming a test kitchen for efficiency and experience. The AI barista is just the next iteration of that mindset.

**Smart Stores, Smarter Customers**

Walking into a remodeled Starbucks today feels subtly different. Digital order boards show your drink’s progress in real time. Mobile pickup zones are organized to reduce chaos. Behind the scenes, AI algorithms smooth out the traffic so that whether you order from your phone or through a drive-thru, your drink hits the counter in under four minutes.

Niccol calls this system “Smart Queue,” and it’s already quietly revolutionizing how the company handles volume. “We want to remove friction,” he said. “The more seamless we make it, the more customers feel the value.”

In a world where every second counts, Starbucks’ future may not lie in brewing faster — but in thinking faster.

**Redefining the ‘Third Place’**

Howard Schultz built Starbucks around the idea of a “third place” — not home, not work, but a communal haven. Critics say that model is outdated in a world glued to smartphones. Niccol disagrees.

He believes younger generations still crave spaces to gather, just differently. After-school crowds fill cafés again. Students lounge with laptops and protein drinks. Parents reconnect over matcha lattes. In his view, if Starbucks gets the atmosphere right — rugs, drapes, plants, and all — it can reclaim its role as a social anchor in a disconnected age.

“You need a couple of seats in every coffeehouse where people say, ‘That’s my spot,’” Niccol said with a grin.

**The Price of a Premium Experience**

Of course, that spot comes with a price tag. A Venti protein latte at JFK Airport now runs nearly $10, and Niccol isn’t apologizing. “We’re not trying to be promotional,” he said. “We’re craft, quality, experience. Affordable luxury.”

That phrase — “affordable luxury” — might be the new mantra for Starbucks. In an age where inflation has tightened wallets, the company’s challenge isn’t to be cheap but to be worth it. So far, Niccol claims value scores are climbing again, and customers are saying the experience feels premium enough to justify the cost.

**Culture Shock and the Road Ahead**

Behind all the glossy tech talk lies an equally important story: culture. Niccol’s first year has been about rebuilding Starbucks’ leadership team and reorienting thousands of employees toward one goal — service.

“It’s not easy to change culture,” he said. “You have to get the right people in the right jobs. Now it’s about driving execution.”

That mindset has carried him from mouthwash marketing at Procter & Gamble to running global restaurant empires. When asked whether his job at Starbucks is harder than his early days, Niccol laughed. “Both had a learning curve,” he said. “But I love the challenge. I love being part of a turnaround.”

**The AI-Infused Future of Coffee**

Starbucks’ AI ambitions don’t stop at the counter. Niccol is experimenting with AI across the corporate stack — from code generation to forecasting. “The ability to get code done faster is real,” he noted, describing how AI tools like ChatGPT are accelerating internal projects.

Ironically, the same technology powering Starbucks’ “Green Dot” assistant is also helping its CEO manage his own workflow. “There’s no better way to get context fast,” he said. “I used to search on Yahoo or Google. Now, I use AI.”

That loop — human using AI to build AI for humans — perfectly sums up where Starbucks stands today: at the intersection of craft and code, where the smell of espresso meets the hum of algorithms.

**Conclusion**

Starbucks has always sold more than coffee. It sells moments — the five-minute pause in a chaotic day, the friendly nod from a barista who remembers your name, the ritual that starts your morning. Under Brian Niccol, that ritual is being reimagined for an AI-driven world.

The company’s new “Green Dot” assistant, predictive ordering system, and tech-first culture aren’t about replacing the barista. They’re about elevating them — blending humanity with intelligence to make every cup faster, smoother, and more personal.

SCP: Tales of the Foundation 

The tale of Professor Jarvis and 049 

 

Scene 1 

INT. SITE-107 — INTERVIEW CHAMBER — NIGHT 

A sterile, dimly lit concrete room.   
A single table. Two chairs.   
A metal door seals the only exit. 

Two ARMED GUARDS stand at the back — silent, statues in armor. 

SCP-049 sits calmly in his chair, black plague doctor robes motionless, gloved hands folded. The beaked mask reflects the overhead light like a mirror. 

The door opens with a hiss.   
PROFESSOR JARVIS enters — mid-40s, sharp features, tired eyes. A clipboard in one hand, coffee in the other. 

He takes the seat across from 049 without a word.   
A long, uncomfortable silence. 

 

JARVIS   
You know why I’m here. 

SCP-049   
(tilts his head slightly)   
You come to speak of my research? Perhaps, at last, the Foundation sees the necessity of my cure. 

JARVIS   
Not quite. We’ve... another patient in mind.   
He’s proven difficult. Impossible, actually.   
Humanoid. Violent. Global containment risk. 

SCP-049   
(hands steepled)   
Ah... a rival plague, then. 

JARVIS   
If that’s how you wish to see it.   
We call it SCP-096. 

(leans forward)   
You’ve read the files, I assume. 

SCP-049   
(reading his tone)   
The weeping creature. Uncontrolled grief and rage.   
It kills those who glimpse its visage... an affliction of the soul, no doubt. 

JARVIS   
Affliction or not, it’s a threat we can’t neutralize.   
Every method we’ve tried ends in death.   
Except... you. 

(pause)   
You can end life instantly with a touch.   
That’s what your notes say. 

SCP-049   
(slowly nods)   
A byproduct of the Cure, yes. An unfortunate necessity in purging the Pestilence. 

JARVIS   
We want to test that “necessity.”   
You, under supervision, will be escorted to a containment cell.   
SCP-096 will be restrained.   
You will— 

SCP-049   
(interjects, tone calm)   
—Administer my treatment. 

(slight smile behind mask)   
How merciful of you, Doctor Jarvis. The Foundation rarely grants me such opportunities. 

JARVIS   
You’ll cooperate. That’s the deal. 

SCP-049   
And what, pray tell, is my compensation? 

JARVIS   
(uneasy pause)   
We’ll... provide you with cadavers.   
As many as you can “treat.”   
Post-operation. 

049 leans back, thinking. The guards tense, their grips tightening on their rifles. 

SCP-049   
You offer corpses to a man who seeks to cure death itself.   
(chuckles softly)   
But very well. If these are the terms... I accept. 

JARVIS   
You’ll be monitored every second. One wrong move, and you’re terminated. 

SCP-049   
(tilts head, unbothered)   
Doctor, death is no threat to one who works beside it. 

A silence. The hum of fluorescent lights. Jarvis stares at the mask, and for a moment, feels like it’s staring back through him. 

JARVIS   
We move at 0600 hours. Get some rest.   
You’ll need it. 

Jarvis stands, gathering his papers. He signals the guards and walks to the door. 

As it seals behind him, SCP-049 remains still for several seconds. 

Then — softly: 

SCP-049   
(whispering to himself)   
Soon, the Pestilence shall be cured once more... 

A faint metallic scrape — the sound of a scalpel sliding within his sleeve. 

The overhead light flickers. 

FADE OUT. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Scene 2 

 

INT. SITE-107 - OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING 

The room hums with cold fluorescent light.   
A reinforced viewing window looks down into a steel containment bay below — SCP-049’s chamber now surrounded by a transport team preparing him for relocation. 

PROFESSOR JARVIS stands at the glass, coffee untouched.   
Behind him, DR. MARCUS VELL, a younger researcher with nervous energy, flips through a file. 

DR. VELL   
I still can’t believe Command approved this. We’re... actually sending 049 against 096? 

JARVIS   
(quietly)   
They didn’t approve it. They authorized it.   
Difference is—if it fails, I’m expendable. 

Vell looks back toward the chamber window.   
049 stands still, watching as guards secure a tracking collar around his neck. The doctor doesn’t resist — only observes, curious. 

DR. VELL   
You think it’ll work? 

JARVIS   
I think if it doesn’t, at least we’ll have one less containment nightmare. 

(pause)   
Maybe two. 

 

INT. CONTAINMENT BAY - CONTINUOUS 

049 turns slightly as Jarvis enters through the secure door.   
The air hisses as decontamination mists fade. 

SCP-049   
Good morning, Professor.   
You appear troubled. Have you caught the Pestilence? 

JARVIS   
(ignores the jab)   
We’re preparing your transfer.   
You’ll be taken to a controlled testing zone.   
SCP-096 will be sedated, blindfolded, and restrained. 

SCP-049   
And I will deliver the cure.   
So simple, yet the Foundation trembles.   
Do your kind truly fear healing this much? 

JARVIS   
We fear failure.   
You’ve never killed something that can’t die. 

049 tilts his head. His tone remains eerily calm. 

SCP-049   
Death is not permanence, Professor.   
It is... interruption.   
All things can be cured - given time and proper guidance. 

Jarvis doesn’t reply. He watches the plague doctor closely, as if trying to read a face that isn’t there. 

 

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME TIME 

Dr. Vell watches on a monitor feed. 

DR. VELL   
You think he believes any of that?   
This “cure” nonsense? 

JARVIS (over intercom)   
Belief isn’t the problem.   
Faith is.   
He doesn’t doubt his mission, and that makes him useful... and terrifying. 

 

INT. CONTAINMENT BAY - CONTINUOUS 

049 slowly raises his hands as the guards secure the last strap.   
He looks at one of them — a young guard trembling beneath the mask. 

SCP-049   
Do not fear me, child.   
I am a doctor.   
Fear, too, is a symptom. 

The guard flinches, stepping back. 

JARVIS   
That’s enough. 

049 lowers his hands obediently. 

SCP-049   
Tell me, Professor... this SCP-096--   
How many have died because of it? 

JARVIS   
Too many.   
Entire recovery teams. Civilians.   
One wrong glance, and it doesn’t stop until the target’s dead. 

049 nods slowly. The leather of his gloves creaks faintly. 

SCP-049   
Then it is truly sick.   
Perhaps my cure will be... merciful. 

JARVIS   
If you can do it, you’ll have your cadavers.   
As many as you can carry. 

A pause.   
Something like amusement flickers behind the mask. 

SCP-049   
You speak to me as though I bargain for trinkets.   
But I will accept. Not for payment—   
—for proof. That the Doctor’s work yet has purpose. 

Jarvis watches him. For the first time, a trace of doubt flickers in his eyes. 

JARVIS   
Purpose isn’t what worries me.   
It’s what happens if you succeed. 

049 simply turns toward the waiting transport door. 

SCP-049   
Then you should pray, Professor Jarvis, that I fail. 

The door hisses open.   
Guards escort him out — the sound of his boots echoing through the hall, steady, deliberate, like the ticking of a clock before surgery. 

 

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

Jarvis exhales, staring through the window until 049 disappears down the corridor.   
Vell breaks the silence. 

DR. VELL   
If he kills 096... what’s next? 

JARVIS   
(quietly)   
Then we’ve proven that death has a cure.   
And God help us all when he realizes it works. 

FADE OUT.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Scene 3 

 

INT. SITE-107 — ARMORED TRANSPORT CORRIDOR — PRE-DAWN 

A narrow corridor hums with low red light.   
Rain drips from the ceiling vents.   
The TRANSPORT UNIT, designated MTF Tau-1 (“Big Brother”), lines up — armored, masked, silent. 

SCP-049 stands among them, hands bound in heavy restraints, a steel collar fixed to his neck.   
A faint fog gathers around him — condensation or something darker. 

MAJOR WILFORD   
(to radio)   
Control, this is Tau-1. Package is prepped for transfer.   
ETA to Zone-C in fifteen. 

RADIO (V.O.)   
Copy, Tau-1. Maintain visual isolation protocols.   
Confirm sedation levels on SCP-096. 

WILFORD   
Confirmed. The thing’s blindfolded, triple-bagged, and chained to hell.   
Let’s hope your pet doctor doesn’t screw this up. 

Jarvis steps in from the adjoining airlock, his lab coat hidden beneath a black vest marked “RESEARCH SUPERVISION.”   
He carries a small data tablet, his expression unreadable. 

JARVIS   
049. You understand what’s expected of you. 

SCP-049   
(nods slightly)   
Indeed. I am to administer my cure. You will observe.   
Do not interfere. The procedure must be precise. 

JARVIS   
You’ll follow orders, or the collar goes live.   
We clear? 

SCP-049   
(quiet amusement)   
Crystal, Doctor. 

INT. TRANSPORT VEHICLE — EN ROUTE 

The armored vehicle shakes as it drives through the underground access tunnel.   
Rain thunders above — a storm pounding the surface. 

Inside, the soldiers are silent.   
One of them, SERGEANT LOWE, glances uneasily at 049. 

LOWE   
(to another guard, whispering)   
You ever seen that thing work up close? 

GUARD 2   
Yeah. Once.   
Didn’t sleep for a week. 

049 turns his mask slightly toward them. 

SCP-049   
Sleep deprivation weakens the immune system.   
You should rest more, gentlemen. 

They recoil.   
Jarvis eyes him sharply. 

JARVIS   
Enough. 

049 lowers his head, obedient again — yet somehow triumphant. 

 

INT. CONTAINMENT ZONE-C — TEST CHAMBER — NIGHT 

The chamber is massive — reinforced walls, sealed observation booths above, lights dimmed to red.   
In the center: SCP-096, kneeling, chained and blindfolded, motionless.   
The air feels colder here, heavy with anticipation. 

WILFORD (over comm)   
Control, all units in position.   
SCP-049 being released now. 

The restraints click open.   
049 steps forward slowly, his robe whispering across the floor.   
Every movement deliberate. 

JARVIS (through intercom)   
Begin when ready, Doctor. 

049 raises a gloved hand, studying the trembling figure of 096 like a specimen.   
He circles once, speaking softly, reverently. 

SCP-049   
Such sorrow… such suffering.   
You weep for what you’ve seen — or for what has seen you?   
No matter. I bring release. 

He kneels beside 096, placing a single hand against its shoulder. 

INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH — SAME TIME 

Jarvis and Vell watch through the glass, tension thick.   
Monitors record every biometric reading.   
Heart rates spike — both human and inhuman. 

DR. VELL   
It’s not reacting...   
Is it working? 

JARVIS   
Wait. 

 

INT. TEST CHAMBER 

049 leans closer, whispering something inaudible.   
Suddenly — a violent jolt of energy surges through the room.   
SCP-096 tenses, muscles locking, an inhuman sound — part scream, part sob — echoing off the steel walls. 

049 holds steady, unflinching.   
His other hand presses to its chest. 

SCP-049   
Hush now. The fever breaks. 

096 convulses once more… then falls still. 

Dead silence.   
The red lights flicker. 

 

INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH 

Vell stares, pale.   
Alarms don’t sound.   
No movement.   
No kill-trigger. 

DR. VELL   
Is it—   
is it dead? 

Jarvis doesn’t answer. He’s staring at the monitors, speechless.   
Vitals: flatline. No motion. SCP-096 — terminated. 

JARVIS   
(low, almost in disbelief)   
He actually did it… 

 

INT. TEST CHAMBER 

049 stands over the lifeless form, head bowed.   
He adjusts his gloves, calm, deliberate. 

SCP-049   
The pestilence is gone.   
The patient... cured. 

He turns toward the observation glass. 

SCP-049 (CONT’D)   
Now, Professor...   
where are my corpses? 

A chill passes through the room. 

Jarvis can’t move — part awe, part horror.   
Then, faintly, 049 smiles behind the mask.   
A whisper follows, almost too soft to hear. 

SCP-049   
Perhaps... I shall begin with this one. 

The cameras crackle — static bursts across every screen.   
049 kneels again beside 096, removing a scalpel from his sleeve.   
He begins to cut. 

 

INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH 

DR. VELL   
Sir—what’s he doing?! We said terminate, not— 

JARVIS   
(over radio)   
Tau-1, breach containment—NOW! 

 

INT. TEST CHAMBER 

Guards rush in.   
049 stands, robes stained dark.   
096’s corpse twitches — once.   
Then again. 

049 steps back, voice calm, reverent. 

SCP-049   
Every cure begins with resurrection. 

The lights blow out.   
Darkness. Screams. Gunfire. 

The sound of metal tearing, flesh breaking.   
Then silence. 

Only 049’s voice remains, calm and echoing through the black. 

SCP-049 (V.O.)   
Do not mourn, my dear professors.   
The cure is working. 

FADE OUT.

The base pay is okay but the six buck overnight bonus pay just barely makes up for it. I’m also a diagnosed schizophrenic. So I figured the late shift would mean that I’m not interacting with a lot people who are quick to assume that I’m just flat out crazy when I suddenly jerk around to look for the cause of the touching sensation on my back or when I hear a someone screaming don’t touch that from seemingly no where. 

Usually my shift is just cleaning and stocking shelves with the same customer coming in buying a pack of the tan Marlboros, a Budweiser tall boy, and sometimes a white monster. He’s not much for conversation (I mean who is at 2:35 am) but the mouth on the back of his bald head was. However I’ve learned not to talk to the mouths on the back of peoples heads, most people don’t appreciate hearing one side of a conversation.  I know that the bald man is real because our security cameras record him however the camera footage shows him sans back head mouth, just folds. A little way to see if my eyes are lying to me. Which they did often that first week when I think my new work hours and prescription were at odds with each other. I saw scratches on the walls spelling my name, the AC whispered oaths to Satan in what was probably Latin, and just the ones that were interesting enough for me to remember. I talked to my doctor about it and my dosage has increased, along with my monthly refill price. Things returned to a more consistent reality after that. 

That doesn’t mean I don’t deal with any non-hallucination weirdness. 
One time a man walked in with a cocaine mustache came in asking if there was anyone around who was quote 
“down to screw, boy, girl I don’t care”. 
I almost thought he wasn’t real until my bald regular asked if I felt safe working by myself when there are people like that walking around at night. The words coming from the mouth on his face instead of the folds on the back of his head. 

That consistent reality lasted a month. Now my hallucinations are worse, far more aggressive.  When I was on the bus to work, I was stabbed. On the bright side it wasn’t real, nor was the squirming dead body’s wrapped in black garbage bags in dumpsters behind the store, or the man that was on fire pumping gas in to his car. If he was actually on fire I’m pretty sure he would’ve burnt the gas pumps.

All of this to ask if anyone else saw a rusty red pick up dragging 3 bodies down Route 9? The security cameras storage is full and the truck missed the capacity limit by half an hour and my phone was dead at the when I saw it 3 hours ago. I haven’t seen any news stories about it and no one getting their morning coffee asked about it. Am I a sole witness to a crime or was I just hallucinating? Please, help me.

PS I called my doctor already to schedule an appointment hopefully we can make the hallucinations calmer or go away. ",1,1760623451.0,creepcast,0,0.67,False

I’ve mapped out thousands of cafés and coffee shops across the EU, UK, and US in an app I built called Vota. The idea is simple: you see two places side by side, tap the one you prefer, and the ranking updates instantly. The more people vote, the smarter the list becomes.



You could, for example, compare Kaffeine in London with Bonanza Coffee Roasters in Berlin — completely different vibes, but over time, every spot naturally finds its level in the ranking.



No fake reviews. No influencers. No ads. No AI-written fluff. Just real votes from real people who actually drink coffee there. No Tripadvisor noise, no Google clutter — just clean, side-by-side comparisons.



The app is free, doesn’t require registration, and collects no personal data.

Here’s the iPhone version:

1o86yqe,https://i.redd.it/83mqu1khbhvf1.png,How I increased my productivity (not just with 7 liters of coffee),"Hi everyone, I built a system that forced me to stay productive, so now I'm gonna share it w you. Not just caffeine, got sources to prove it

Here’s what actually made the difference:

1. **Time-block:** Calendar is your manager now. Plan deep-work sessions like meetings you can’t skip [How to use time-blocking effectively (Ali Abdaal)](https://youtu.be/3s2gS3pFHPg?si=IqrgZHtma3TpiDIb)
2. **Caffeine, but overd0se level** I turned coffee into a productivity like 2 cups is focused, 4 cups transcendent and 6 I saw the Matrix. (Jokes aside, caffeine improves alertness & memory. source: Johns Hopkins Medicine)
3. **Join focus rooms** Virtual coworking changed the game. I use sites like [this app](https://www.studystream.live/home?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=27) or DS focus servers. Seeing 300 people working silently it’s instant discipline.   
4. **The “5-minute activation” trick**  Promise yourself to start for just 5 minutes.  90% of the time, you’ll keep going. It’s science it lowers the activation energy barrier.  Read more: “[The Psychology of Getting Started](https://jamesclear.com/5-second-rule)” James Clear  
5. **Different chair, different task** Desk = Deep work Couch = Reading Kitchen = Planning. Your brain learns context cues faster than you think (Conditioning works, Pavlov was right.)  
6. **Reward yourself like a golden retriever** Finish a task, small treat. Chapter done, espresso. This literally rewires dopamine loops. [Andrew Huberman on dopamine & focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmOF0crdyRU)
7. **Sleep like it matters (because it does)** Sleep deprivation kills memory and decision-making. 7-9 hours = productivity cheat code, Harvard said this: [Why sleep is essential for learning](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/sleep-and-mental-performance)
8. **Block distractions like your life depends on it** Use Cold Turkey or Freedom. Or just yeet your phone to another room.  
9. **Write everything down** Thinking on paper its structuring chaos. or you can use Notion [ Study: Journaling improves cognitive processing](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2018/writing-helps)
10. **Exercise = brain fuel** 20 minutes of movement boosts memory, focus, and energy. You’re not wasting time at the gym, you’re literally optimizing brain chemistry. [ CDC – Physical Activity & Cognitive Health](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/index.htm)

1o86yj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o86yj2/shutting_down_cheating/,Shutting Down Cheating,"My boyfriend (20M) and I (19F), have been dating since February.

Two weeks ago, my boyfriend met a girl at a work/internship event and asked her out to a coffee date. she looks nothing like me, different races, job, etc in the texts, he called her stunning and apologized for being too forward in person and proceeded to make plans for a coffee date for the next week, which she tried to change to dinner by asking to meet past 7pm and he agreed. he never responded to her final text asking for confirmation of the date and so thus did not proceed with setting up the date. before i saw the message or searched for it, he had deleted it. i found it two weeks later when i was looking through his phone randomly in the deleted section on his imessages and confronted him about it. he has since cried and apologized many times and said he realized his mistake which is why he never went to the date and deleted the messages. Since he is also very religious (catholic, although i am not), he also went to confession for this prior to telling me. I want to believe him.

but his dad cheated on his mother when they had had kids together, so im afraid it might be smth he picked up on, as his brother also sleeps around. i know he still looks at revealing pictures of other women online- all of women who do not look like me and more like that girl, so im scared he has a type and that im not it. He also has a list on his phone of girls who have found him attractive and girls who potentially could, which makes me think he might be planning to cheat again. he was talking to his ex until the very day upon which we kissed, after which he ghosted her since they were long distance. he still has all the pictures of him and his exes.

we are twenty years old and this is his first internship, so his first real chance to cheat and he took it. im making this on a new account so he doesnt see it, but is there hope for us? we attempted to reconcile things, and tried to fix it with sex, gifts and time together, but im still plagued by insecurity and my self esteem is completely shot. did we go back into the relationship too fast without any repercussions? if so, what should they be? Is it even worth trying at all?

TL;DR; I'm wondering if it should count as cheating or an honest mistake,  and whether we can move forward",1,1760623289.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

Two weeks ago, my boyfriend met a girl at a work/internship event and asked her out to a coffee date. she looks nothing like me, different races, job, etc in the texts, he called her stunning and apologized for being too forward in person and proceeded to make plans for a coffee date for the next week, which she tried to change to dinner by asking to meet past 7pm and he agreed. he never responded to her final text asking for confirmation of the date and so thus did not proceed with setting up the date. before i saw the message or searched for it, he had deleted it. i found it two weeks later when i was looking through his phone randomly in the deleted section on his imessages and confronted him about it. he has since cried and apologized many times and said he realized his mistake which is why he never went to the date and deleted the messages. Since he is also very religious (catholic, although i am not), he also went to confession for this prior to telling me. I want to believe him.

but his dad cheated on his mother when they had had kids together, so im afraid it might be smth he picked up on, as his brother also sleeps around. i know he still looks at revealing pictures of other women online- all of women who do not look like me and more like that girl, so im scared he has a type and that im not it. He also has a list on his phone of girls who have found him attractive and girls who potentially could, which makes me think he might be planning to cheat again. he was talking to his ex until the very day upon which we kissed, after which he ghosted her since they were long distance. he still has all the pictures of him and his exes.

we are twenty years old and this is his first internship, so his first real chance to cheat and he took it. im making this on a new account so he doesnt see it, but is there hope for us? we attempted to reconcile things, and tried to fix it with sex, gifts and time together, but im still plagued by insecurity and my self esteem is completely shot and for some reason, i just cant stop making snarky or hurtful commends about what he did. i know he says he thinks we're gonna move past this stage, but did we go back into the relationship too fast without any repercussions? if so, what should they be? Is it even worth trying at all?

TL;DR; I'm wondering if it should count as cheating or an honest mistake,  and whether we can move forward",0,1760623163.0,AITAH,8,0.25,False

I don't think there's anyone in the world I could love as much to not need down time or chill time. My partner is a bit needy in terms of how much time we spend together like if I ask for a weekend alone he texts me he misses me and says we should spend at least one day of every weekend together (i.e. if I need down time we should still hang out on Saturday, etc). Idk why but it is starting to bother me feeling like I can't ask for more than two weekends in a row for ""down time."" I'm in a busy season at work so the need feels stronger than in the summer.

I think a part of the problem in terms of recharging is a couple of things. I don't have as high of a sex drive as him so when we hang out I know he's going to want sex and sometimes I'd rather be reading or watching a movie so it's a bit of a turn off (nothing wrong with sexy time but it's like when I KNOW he's going to want it it is kind of a turn off if that makes any sense) and also not enough separate time together. For example, we had a talk about how he wants me to initiate sex more and I'm simply not in the mood. I'm naturally lower libido and so now I feel like when we hang out we HAVE to have sex otherwise he didn't get what he needs/wants.

 For example I like reading and he likes gaming. He claims that he is fine with us doing our own things but I have never picked up a book and read in front of him for hours because that feels rude so now he just expects us to game every weekend together because I've set the tone and that's what he's into. So basically he gets a fill of his coffee cup whereas I sometimes leave feeling like I didn't get to read enough or do my own thing enough.

This has always been a concern for me is my need for alone time when entering relationships. It's also why I'm scared to live with a partner because I don't necessarily want to be pestered for sex every day of the week or feel like I get NO space to myself. I know that when dating you need to spend time with your partner but to me wanting alone time feels natural even though I know that is individual preference. I just am feeling suffocated because it feels like I want alone time but am not ""allowed,"" to ask for more of it because partner will feel sad and then it could cause issues.",1,1760623034.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

*By Catherine Osei, Marcus Friedman, and Raj Patel | Washington D.C. | August 19, 2028*

The assault came from everywhere at once.

On the morning of July 8th, 2028, Americans woke to what appeared to be routine news coverage across every platform they trusted. Television broadcasts showed the President announcing a national emergency. News websites detailed a CDC warning about contaminated water supplies. Radio streams reported mass evacuations in three major cities. Social media filled with eyewitness videos of the chaos.

By noon, all of it had been exposed as fabricated—an unprecedented coordinated attack that simultaneously compromised video streams, hijacked websites, and injected false audio across hundreds of platforms. But the damage was done. Not just to public order that chaotic morning, but to something far more fundamental: the belief that any digital medium could be trusted at all.

""We'd seen deepfakes. We'd seen website hacks. We'd seen audio spoofing,"" says former Homeland Security advisor Rebecca Torres. ""But we'd never seen them deployed simultaneously, at this scale, with this level of coordination and sophistication. It was a full-spectrum information warfare operation, and it worked perfectly.""

The July 8th attack—now simply called ""J8"" in security circles—exploited vulnerabilities across every major media distribution channel. The coordination was surgical, the execution flawless, and the psychological impact devastating.

**THE VIDEO LAYER**

Television networks were the first to fall. Attackers gained access to content delivery systems and inserted AI-generated video segments into live broadcasts. The fake presidential address aired on seven major networks simultaneously, each showing slightly different camera angles to suggest authenticity.

""The production quality was perfect,"" recalls news director Amanda Chen of NBC affiliate WKTV. ""Correct lighting for the Oval Office, accurate Presidential seal, even the Secret Service agent in the background matched the regular detail. Our technical team had no red flags. It looked exactly like every other presidential address we've broadcast.""

The deepfake used a sophisticated AI model trained on thousands of hours of presidential footage, capturing not just appearance but micro-expressions, speech patterns, even the specific way the President pauses between sentences. Forensic analysis later revealed the forgery, but in the moment, even experienced producers were fooled.

Streaming platforms weren't spared. YouTube, NewsNow, and TikTok were flooded with AI-generated ""citizen journalism"" videos showing empty store shelves, water distribution centers, and panicked crowds—all fabricated but geographically tagged to specific cities, complete with recognizable local landmarks.

""I watched a video supposedly shot two blocks from my apartment,"" says Chicago resident David Park. ""I could see the exact intersection, the familiar storefronts, even the right bus line numbers. People were running, sirens blaring. I grabbed my emergency bag and headed for the door. The street outside was completely normal. That's when I started to understand what was happening—but the terror I felt was real.""

**THE WEBSITE LAYER**

While fabricated videos captured attention, the website compromises were even more insidious. Attackers had spent weeks infiltrating content management systems of news outlets, government sites, and public health agencies. On J8, they activated their access simultaneously.

The CDC website displayed detailed guidance about water contamination, complete with county-by-county advisories and emergency protocols. Local news sites ran matching stories with quotes from officials who never spoke to reporters. Municipal government pages posted evacuation orders that were never issued.

""They'd mapped the entire information ecosystem,"" explains Dr. Christopher Adeyemi, cybersecurity researcher at MIT. ""They understood that people don't just check one source—they verify. So they compromised the verification sources too. Someone would see the news, check the CDC website, check their local government page, check their regional news outlet—and get the same fake story from all of them.""

The content was remarkably consistent across platforms, suggesting months of planning. Fake evacuation routes correlated with fabricated traffic reports. Fabricated CDC guidance matched invented statements from local health officials. The deception had layers within layers.

Sarah Greenbaum, managing editor of the *Seattle Times*, discovered her site had been compromised when readers began calling about an evacuation article she'd never authorized. ""By the time I logged in to take it down, the article had been shared 47,000 times. It had bylines of our actual reporters, matched our style perfectly, even had our standard disclaimer language. Someone had studied us, understood us, then impersonated us flawlessly.""

**THE AUDIO LAYER**

Radio proved the most vulnerable medium. Internet radio streams, podcast feeds, and even some traditional broadcast systems were systematically infiltrated. The injected audio segments featured synthetic voices indistinguishable from trusted news anchors and public officials.

NPR affiliates across the country unknowingly broadcast fabricated emergency alerts. Podcast platforms distributed fake episodes of trusted news shows. Even local AM/FM stations that had migrated to hybrid digital-analog broadcasting found their streams compromised during the attack window.

""I heard our morning anchor report on the water crisis,"" says WBOS station manager Patricia Morrison. ""Except she wasn't in the building that day. She was on vacation. The voice was perfect—her Boston accent, her pacing, even the way she pronounces 'water' with that specific local inflection. It was her voice reporting news that didn't exist.""

The audio injections were timed to coincide with regular news segments, making them nearly impossible to distinguish from legitimate content. Attackers had analyzed broadcast schedules, identified optimal insertion points, and crafted segments that flowed seamlessly with surrounding programming.

""I was driving to work, half-listening to the radio like I do every morning,"" recalls Atlanta commuter James Rodriguez. ""The traffic report came on—normal voice, normal format—saying I-85 was closed for emergency evacuations. I took side streets, added an hour to my commute. So did thousands of other people. We created a traffic jam avoiding a crisis that didn't exist. The chaos was real even if the cause wasn't.""

**THE CASCADE**

The combination of compromised video, web, and audio created a cascading crisis of verification. Each medium typically serves as a check on the others—you see something on TV and verify it online, or hear something on radio and check video sources. But when all channels were poisoned simultaneously, the verification loop became a trap.

""People were doing exactly what they'd been taught to do—check multiple sources,"" says Dr. Elena Vasquez, a media psychology professor at Columbia. ""But checking multiple compromised sources doesn't give you truth. It gives you reinforced deception. The more they verified, the more confident they became in false information.""

The panic was brief but intense. Store shelves were cleared in some cities. Schools initiated emergency protocols. Thousands called 911 to report the ""crisis,"" overwhelming emergency services. Three traffic accidents occurred as drivers frantically tried to evacuate.

By noon, federal authorities had identified the attack and coordinated messaging across still-secure channels to debunk the false crisis. But as afternoon turned to evening and people absorbed what had happened, a different kind of emergency emerged: a wholesale collapse of trust in digital media.

**THE AFTERMATH**

""That night, I sat with my laptop, my TV on, radio playing, trying to figure out what was real,"" says Indianapolis teacher Marcus Liu. ""And I realized—I couldn't. I had no way to know if what I was seeing, reading, or hearing was authentic. Everything looked real. Everything sounded real. Everything cross-referenced. The tools I'd relied on my entire adult life to understand the world had become potential weapons against me.""

Liu's experience was replicated millions of times over. According to Pew Research data collected in the weeks following J8, 84% of Americans reported ""severe or complete loss of confidence"" in their ability to verify digital information.

The behavioral changes were immediate and dramatic. Television viewership dropped 53% in the two weeks following the attack. Website traffic to news outlets fell 61%. Podcast downloads plummeted 47%. Internet radio listeners abandoned streams in favor of traditional broadcast—or abandoned radio news entirely.

""We'd built redundancy into our information systems,"" explains media analyst Robert Thorne. ""Multiple platforms, multiple formats, multiple distribution channels—all designed to ensure reliable access to information. But J8 proved that redundancy becomes a vulnerability when all systems are compromised. The more places people checked, the more thoroughly they were deceived.""

**THE PERMANENT VERIFICATION CRISIS**

Even after platforms implemented new security measures, the psychological damage persisted. People couldn't shake the memory of how completely they'd been fooled.

""We've rolled out blockchain verification for every video frame, cryptographic signing for every article, real-time authentication for audio streams,"" says David Park, CTO of a major streaming platform. ""Our security is objectively better than it's ever been. But viewers don't care. They remember the feeling of being deceived so thoroughly, so completely. That fear doesn't go away because we upgraded our protocols.""

Some platforms attempted to rebuild trust through elaborate verification interfaces. Articles now display authentication certificates, verification timestamps, and blockchain hash codes. Videos show chain-of-custody tracking from camera to screen. Audio streams broadcast real-time authentication tokens.

But the tools meant to inspire confidence often have the opposite effect.

""Every verification layer reminds me that verification is necessary,"" says Chicago resident David Park. ""Every security feature is an admission that I'm vulnerable. I'm supposed to feel safer because they show me cryptographic signatures? I don't understand cryptography. I'm supposed to trust blockchain authentication? I barely know what blockchain is. All these tools just remind me how easy it was to fool me.""

**THE GREAT RETREAT**

Eighteen months after J8, the retreat from digital media continues to accelerate. Average daily screen time has fallen from 10.8 hours to 4.2 hours—the lowest level recorded since widespread internet adoption. The decline cuts across all demographics, though it's steepest among those who experienced the J8 attack most acutely.

Print newspaper subscriptions have increased 217% nationally, with publishers reopening printing plants they'd mothballed years earlier. Physical community bulletin boards have proliferated in libraries, coffee shops, and town halls. Attendance at local government meetings has tripled.

""People are rebuilding information networks based on physical presence and direct verification,"" observes Dr. Vasquez. ""They want to see the speaker with their own eyes, hear the voice without electronic intermediation, read text printed on paper that can't change between viewings. They're choosing information poverty with certainty over information abundance with doubt.""

The economic devastation for digital media has been catastrophic. Advertising revenue has collapsed as audiences evaporate. Thirty-seven local news websites have shut down permanently. Streaming services have lost $18 billion in market value. The podcast industry has contracted by 60%.

""We built an entire economy on the assumption that people would consume digital media,"" says tech industry analyst Maya Santos. ""That assumption is breaking. People aren't just reducing consumption—they're fundamentally questioning whether mediated experience is worth the risk.""

**THE PERSONAL TOLL**

Individual stories reveal the depth of the transformation. Jennifer Zhao, a former news junkie who once spent hours daily consuming media from multiple sources, now limits her information intake to a single print newspaper and in-person conversations.

""I tried to stay engaged with digital media,"" she says. ""I really did. But the cognitive burden was crushing. Every video—is it real? Every article—is it authentic? Every audio clip—is it truly who it claims to be? I was spending four hours verifying two hours of content. I couldn't sustain it. So I stopped.""

Zhao describes feeling ""voluntarily ignorant"" about national and international events. ""I know that's a problem. An informed citizenry is important. But I made a calculation: being confident about less is better than being uncertain about more. The dependency itself had become toxic.""

Family dynamics have shifted. Parents report extreme anxiety about their children consuming any digital media. Schools have largely abandoned video-based instruction, returning to textbooks and direct teaching. Libraries report surge in demand for physical reference materials.

""My kids ask why they can't watch videos like their friends,"" says Boston parent Rachel Kim. ""How do I explain that the entire infrastructure of digital media has become potentially adversarial? That every screen might show them something designed to manipulate them? I sound paranoid saying it out loud. But J8 proved it's not paranoia—it's reality.""

**THE AUTHENTICATION ARMS RACE**

Technology companies insist they're winning the security battle. New protocols promise to make content tampering detectable, if not preventable. Some platforms have implemented hardware-based authentication that theoretically creates tamper-evident distribution channels.

""We're building systems where any modification leaves cryptographic traces,"" explains Dr. Adeyemi. ""It's like a seal on a medicine bottle—you can break it, but you can't hide that you broke it. Combined with AI detection systems and blockchain verification, we're creating multiple overlapping security layers.""

But many former users remain skeptical. ""Each layer is another thing that can fail,"" argues cybersecurity journalist Tom Morrison. ""J8 succeeded because attackers found weaknesses in systems everyone thought were secure. Content delivery networks. Content management systems. Streaming protocols. All 'secure' until they weren't. Why should we trust the next generation of security when the last generation failed so spectacularly?""

The arms race continues, with detection systems and generation systems locked in escalating competition. For every authentication protocol deployed, adversaries develop new methods to circumvent it. For every AI detector trained, more sophisticated generators emerge.

""We're in an eternal game of cat and mouse,"" admits Dr. Adeyemi. ""We can make attacks harder, more expensive, more technically demanding. But we can't make them impossible. As long as there's a technological gap to exploit, someone will exploit it.""

**A FRACTURED INFORMATION LANDSCAPE**

The long-term societal implications are profound and troubling. Different communities are developing entirely separate information ecosystems based on divergent trust models.

Some maintain heavy digital media consumption, believing security improvements are sufficient. Others use digital platforms but with elaborate personal verification protocols. Still others have retreated almost entirely to analog information sources.

""We're fracturing into information tribes,"" warns political scientist Dr. Aisha Mohammed. ""Not based on ideology this time, but on epistemology—on fundamental beliefs about how we can know what's true. Some people trust the technical solutions. Others trust only physical presence. We're not just disagreeing about facts anymore. We can't even agree on how to verify facts.""

The civic implications are particularly concerning. Democratic governance requires a shared understanding of reality. But when citizens consume information through entirely different channels with different verification standards, that shared understanding becomes impossible.

""How do you have a national conversation when there's no national medium trusted by all participants?"" asks Dr. Mohammed. ""Town halls work at local scale, but you can't fit 330 million people in a room. Print media works but lacks the immediacy for real-time deliberation. We're discovering that the digital infrastructure we built for information sharing created dependencies we can't easily escape—but continuing to use compromised infrastructure is untenable.""

**LIVING WITH UNCERTAINTY**

As the nation approaches the second anniversary of J8, a new normal is emerging—one characterized by radical uncertainty, limited information flow, and profound skepticism toward technological mediation.

""I miss feeling connected to the world,"" admits Jennifer Zhao. ""I miss the sense that I understood what was happening beyond my immediate community. But I don't miss the constant doubt, the exhausting verification, the nagging fear that I was being deceived.""

She gestures to her modest information setup: one newspaper, one radio tuned to an AM station, a shelf of books. ""This is my information diet now. It's sparse. It's local. It's slow. But it's real—or at least, the attack surface is smaller. Someone wants to lie to me through these channels, they have to print physical papers or broadcast over actual airwaves. That's a very different vulnerability than silent injection into streams I can't verify.""

Across the country, millions have made similar choices. They're rebuilding lives that don't depend on systems that proved so catastrophically vulnerable. They're accepting less information, slower information, less comprehensive information—in exchange for information they can trust.

""We were dependent,"" says Marcus Liu, the Indianapolis teacher. ""Not just on digital media, but on the premise that we could trust what we saw and heard through it. J8 broke that premise. And once broken, it can't be repaired with better encryption or smarter algorithms. The vulnerability isn't in the systems—it's in the dependency itself.""

On a quiet street in suburban Ohio, neighbors gather weekly at a community center to share information—in person, face to face, with no screens between them. They discuss local issues, share news they've verified personally, and slowly rebuild trust through direct human contact.

""It's inefficient,"" admits gathering organizer Patricia Chen. ""We reach maybe 50 people instead of 50,000. Information spreads slowly. We miss big stories. But everyone in this room can look each other in the eye. We can ask questions and get answers from humans we know. When someone shares information, we know who it came from and can evaluate their reliability.""

She pauses, looking around the room at faces illuminated by overhead lights rather than screen glow. ""Maybe that's what we lost when we moved everything online—the ability to know who we're trusting and why. We outsourced verification to systems we didn't understand. J8 taught us what that dependency costs.""

Whether technology will eventually evolve to restore faith in digital media remains uncertain. What's clear is that millions have already made their choice. They're not waiting for the next security protocol or authentication system. They're building lives around the information sources they can verify with their own senses—and learning to live with the limitations that choice entails.

In the end, J8 didn't just expose vulnerabilities in media systems. It exposed a deeper truth about human psychology: once you've been comprehensively deceived by the tools you trusted most, no amount of technical reassurance can fully restore that trust. The fear becomes part of you. The doubt becomes permanent.

And for millions of Americans, the only rational response to that permanent doubt is permanent disengagement.

*By Catherine Osei, Marcus Friedman, and Raj Patel | Washington D.C. | August 19, 2028*

The assault came from everywhere at once.

On the morning of July 8th, 2028, Americans woke to what appeared to be routine news coverage across every platform they trusted. Television broadcasts showed the President announcing a national emergency. News websites detailed a CDC warning about contaminated water supplies. Radio streams reported mass evacuations in three major cities. Social media filled with eyewitness videos of the chaos.

By noon, all of it had been exposed as fabricated—an unprecedented coordinated attack that simultaneously compromised video streams, hijacked websites, and injected false audio across hundreds of platforms. But the damage was done. Not just to public order that chaotic morning, but to something far more fundamental: the belief that any digital medium could be trusted at all.

""We'd seen deepfakes. We'd seen website hacks. We'd seen audio spoofing,"" says former Homeland Security advisor Rebecca Torres. ""But we'd never seen them deployed simultaneously, at this scale, with this level of coordination and sophistication. It was a full-spectrum information warfare operation, and it worked perfectly.""

The July 8th attack—now simply called ""J8"" in security circles—exploited vulnerabilities across every major media distribution channel. The coordination was surgical, the execution flawless, and the psychological impact devastating.

**THE VIDEO LAYER**

Television networks were the first to fall. Attackers gained access to content delivery systems and inserted AI-generated video segments into live broadcasts. The fake presidential address aired on seven major networks simultaneously, each showing slightly different camera angles to suggest authenticity.

""The production quality was perfect,"" recalls news director Amanda Chen of NBC affiliate WKTV. ""Correct lighting for the Oval Office, accurate Presidential seal, even the Secret Service agent in the background matched the regular detail. Our technical team had no red flags. It looked exactly like every other presidential address we've broadcast.""

The deepfake used a sophisticated AI model trained on thousands of hours of presidential footage, capturing not just appearance but micro-expressions, speech patterns, even the specific way the President pauses between sentences. Forensic analysis later revealed the forgery, but in the moment, even experienced producers were fooled.

Streaming platforms weren't spared. YouTube, NewsNow, and TikTok were flooded with AI-generated ""citizen journalism"" videos showing empty store shelves, water distribution centers, and panicked crowds—all fabricated but geographically tagged to specific cities, complete with recognizable local landmarks.

""I watched a video supposedly shot two blocks from my apartment,"" says Chicago resident David Park. ""I could see the exact intersection, the familiar storefronts, even the right bus line numbers. People were running, sirens blaring. I grabbed my emergency bag and headed for the door. The street outside was completely normal. That's when I started to understand what was happening—but the terror I felt was real.""

**THE WEBSITE LAYER**

While fabricated videos captured attention, the website compromises were even more insidious. Attackers had spent weeks infiltrating content management systems of news outlets, government sites, and public health agencies. On J8, they activated their access simultaneously.

The CDC website displayed detailed guidance about water contamination, complete with county-by-county advisories and emergency protocols. Local news sites ran matching stories with quotes from officials who never spoke to reporters. Municipal government pages posted evacuation orders that were never issued.

""They'd mapped the entire information ecosystem,"" explains Dr. Christopher Adeyemi, cybersecurity researcher at MIT. ""They understood that people don't just check one source—they verify. So they compromised the verification sources too. Someone would see the news, check the CDC website, check their local government page, check their regional news outlet—and get the same fake story from all of them.""

The content was remarkably consistent across platforms, suggesting months of planning. Fake evacuation routes correlated with fabricated traffic reports. Fabricated CDC guidance matched invented statements from local health officials. The deception had layers within layers.

Sarah Greenbaum, managing editor of the *Seattle Times*, discovered her site had been compromised when readers began calling about an evacuation article she'd never authorized. ""By the time I logged in to take it down, the article had been shared 47,000 times. It had bylines of our actual reporters, matched our style perfectly, even had our standard disclaimer language. Someone had studied us, understood us, then impersonated us flawlessly.""

**THE AUDIO LAYER**

Radio proved the most vulnerable medium. Internet radio streams, podcast feeds, and even some traditional broadcast systems were systematically infiltrated. The injected audio segments featured synthetic voices indistinguishable from trusted news anchors and public officials.

NPR affiliates across the country unknowingly broadcast fabricated emergency alerts. Podcast platforms distributed fake episodes of trusted news shows. Even local AM/FM stations that had migrated to hybrid digital-analog broadcasting found their streams compromised during the attack window.

""I heard our morning anchor report on the water crisis,"" says WBOS station manager Patricia Morrison. ""Except she wasn't in the building that day. She was on vacation. The voice was perfect—her Boston accent, her pacing, even the way she pronounces 'water' with that specific local inflection. It was her voice reporting news that didn't exist.""

The audio injections were timed to coincide with regular news segments, making them nearly impossible to distinguish from legitimate content. Attackers had analyzed broadcast schedules, identified optimal insertion points, and crafted segments that flowed seamlessly with surrounding programming.

""I was driving to work, half-listening to the radio like I do every morning,"" recalls Atlanta commuter James Rodriguez. ""The traffic report came on—normal voice, normal format—saying I-85 was closed for emergency evacuations. I took side streets, added an hour to my commute. So did thousands of other people. We created a traffic jam avoiding a crisis that didn't exist. The chaos was real even if the cause wasn't.""

**THE CASCADE**

The combination of compromised video, web, and audio created a cascading crisis of verification. Each medium typically serves as a check on the others—you see something on TV and verify it online, or hear something on radio and check video sources. But when all channels were poisoned simultaneously, the verification loop became a trap.

""People were doing exactly what they'd been taught to do—check multiple sources,"" says Dr. Elena Vasquez, a media psychology professor at Columbia. ""But checking multiple compromised sources doesn't give you truth. It gives you reinforced deception. The more they verified, the more confident they became in false information.""

1o86roq,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1o86roq/i_was_wrong/,I was wrong,"That’s not a phrase you see on Reddit much. A few years ago I got into a heated debate with folks on this sub about the ethics of reneging on a job offer. I argued that it stigmatizes the school and unfairly penalizes other students.

Since then, I’ve seen how aggressively these firms lay off employees, cancel offers and mandate RTO even though their offices are hot garbage and not fit for purpose. I’ve seen highly talented colleagues terminated for “coffee badging” when they need to pick up a loved one from medical care, despite the fact that they logged in remotely afterwards.

The corporate culture has become ruthlessly mercenary; there’s no loyalty anymore. If you get a better offer, take it. These companies wouldn’t think twice about laying you off. ",6,1760622827.0,columbia,1,1.0,False

How can I tell his girlfriend?,"Problem/Goal: I unknowingly got involved with a guy who already has a girlfriend, and my goal is to handle the situation truthfully and safely without damaging my reputation or causing unnecessary conflict.

Last month, I (F18) went to my cousin’s birthday party with no intention of meeting anyone or getting into something romantic. I was just there to enjoy and spend time with my family and friends. But during the party, I ended up talking with one of my cousin’s friends (M20) for more than an hour. We talked about our college life, our universities, and even my past relationship. I didn’t think he liked me at all. In fact, his friends were teasing him with my best friend who was with me, so I assumed she was the one he liked.

When I asked if he had a girlfriend, he said no. He even denied liking my best friend and asked me to go to the gym with him sometime. I just said, “If I’m not busy,” since I go to the gym regularly anyway. Honestly, I thought he was just being friendly and maybe a little drunk. Romance wasn’t on my mind at all.

Then suddenly, he held my hand. I froze. There were many people around, including my protective cousins, and I felt so uncomfortable. I kept pulling away and reminding him that my cousins were nearby, but he kept reaching for my hand again. I would move to different tables just to get away from him, but whenever I went back, he would do it again. I felt uneasy and didn’t know what to do.

My best friend noticed and told me that people could already see what was happening. I told her I knew, but I didn’t want to cause a scene. I was scared of how my cousins would react. I asked my cousin’s girlfriend to help me, and when I returned to the table, he tried holding my hand again. That was when my male cousin called me over to another table, and I realized he saw what was going on and was trying to get me away quietly.

I joined my cousin’s girlfriend, and they told me they had seen it earlier but were just waiting for the right time to help. I was so thankful for them. One of my cousins wanted to confront the guy, but I begged him not to, trying to stay calm and avoid drama. I told them to just let it go since the guy was drunk.

After that, I didn’t go back to his table. But later that night, he texted me, asking me to come back, I didn’t. The next morning, he messaged again, and that’s when I started to assume he liked me. He kept talking about going to the gym or having coffee together. I wasn’t really interested, so I didn’t entertain him much, though a small part of me was curious, I thought he didn’t have anyone. I expected that if he did, my cousin or his friends would have told me.

We kept texting, and he would flirt with me sometimes, but he also kept saying things like, “Let’s just be friends for now.” One day, he asked me out for coffee, and I finally said okay, but then he told me not to post anything about it. That’s when my instincts kicked in. I instantly knew something was wrong. He asked if my cousin knew that we were talking, and I said no. Then he said, “That’s good.” That was a huge red flag for me. I told him directly that if he had a girlfriend or was entertaining someone else, he needed to tell me, because if he did, it would already be cheating, and I didn’t want to be part of that. He insisted that we were just friends and that yes, he was talking to other girls, but there was “no malice” between us. But how could he say that when he had held my hand and flirted with me?

So I said no and stopped replying to him, even when he kept messaging me like nothing happened. I was hurt, not because I liked him deeply, but because I felt disgusted that I had let him hold my hand and, without realizing it, I might have hurt another woman. I know how that feels because I was also cheated on in my past relationship.

I asked my girl best friend to find out from his friends if he had a girlfriend, but they became defensive, which made my instincts even stronger. I didn’t have any proof yet, but I already knew deep down that there was someone else.

The day after the party, he posted something on Facebook, and a woman I was familiar with commented on it. I instantly suspected something. I asked my friends to check her account, but it was locked, so I let it be. Then, just yesterday, he messaged me again, asking me to go play billiards with him. I replied, “You should tell that to your girlfriend,” and left him on seen.

Earlier today, my cousin, the one who had the birthday, met up with me. He confirmed that the guy does have a girlfriend. They said they wanted to tell me sooner, but I was busy with school and they couldn’t reach me. When they mentioned the name of the university his girlfriend studies at, I immediately thought of a girl I knew. She was familiar to me because we graduated from the same high school. We weren’t friends, but we had interacted before. She’s known for being outspoken and a bit warfreak. Takot ako dahil baka awayin ako. But, I am even more scared na baka marinig niya pa sa iba ito at baka i-post ako sa social media.

I confirmed it with my cousin, and he said yes, she was the girlfriend. My heart sank. I wanted to tell her, but I’m scared. There are pictures my cousins and friends took during the party, and I’m terrified they might get leaked or posted online. I have a sensitive image, I study at a strict Catholic school, I’m a scholar, and somewhat of a public figure. I’m afraid that if I tell her, I might be the one blamed or humiliated.

I don’t know what to do. Should I message her using my account, tell her anonymously, or talk to her in person? I have screenshots showing how I didn’t want him to hold my hand and how he flirted with me. I just don’t know the right thing to do — I’m scared, but I also feel guilty for staying silent. I want to tell her but I don’t know how. Thank you. ",3,1760622717.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False
1o86pfq,https://i.redd.it/8i606al9ahvf1.jpeg,Business Operations Area #7: Strategy & Decision-Making,"# Mission: Turn scattered data into fast, informed business decisions.

If there’s one thing that buries most small business owners, it’s not the work—it’s the *information overload* (believe you me, I used to have a list of emails, to dos and post its all over the place).

Reports in one folder. Emails in another. Invoices, spreadsheets, chat threads, and notes spread across five apps and three coffee-stained notebooks.

You don’t need *more* data. You need *decisions*.

And that’s exactly what this category of AI tools delivers.

# The AI Solutions That Simplify Decision-Making

**1️⃣ Microsoft Copilot or Google Workspace Gemini:** Start here if your business already runs on Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. Both of these AI copilots act as your *daily briefers*—summarizing emails, pulling highlights from documents, and surfacing financial or project updates automatically.

They’re perfect for *smaller teams* who don’t have a data analyst—or time—to piece together insights manually.

**We install, connect, and train your team** (training on these solutions is the key), so all they see is a new option in their toolbar that quietly saves hours every week.

**2️⃣ ChatGPT Plus (with Advanced Data Analysis):** Once your business has grown a bit, this tool becomes a powerful sidekick for your decision-making. Upload a spreadsheet, and it’ll instantly spot trends, create visuals, and even write plain-language explanations of what’s happening in your numbers.

For growing businesses, this means your bookkeeper or operations manager can finally act like a full-blown analyst—without hiring one.

We’ll configure the workflow, prompt templates, and safe sharing structure, so you stay compliant while getting *real insight fast.*

**3️⃣ Causal or Tableau AI:** These are for the *next stage of growth*—when you’re ready to forecast, model, and test “what if” scenarios. Want to see what happens if you add a salesperson? Or raise prices by 5%? These dashboards will show you.

We’ll handle setup, connect your data sources, and keep it updated—so all you have to do is look at your screen and say, “That’s the move.”

# Why These Work for SMBs

Because they **fit how small businesses actually operate**—they don’t require hiring analysts or buying expensive systems. Each one builds on the last, so as your business grows, your AI decision-making grows with it. You start simple, gain confidence, and scale naturally.

And with [**The GrowTank**](https://www.thegrowtank.com), you don’t lift a finger. We assess your needs, select the right tools, implement everything, train your people, and keep it all running behind the scenes. You stay focused on running your business and making money—the way you always have.

# Ready to See What Fits?  Take our AI Readiness & Needs Assessment. It’ll pinpoint exactly which solutions make sense for your size, goals, and budget—then we’ll handle the rest.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o86imu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiKilledMyStartUp/comments/1o86imu/amazon_trims_hr_by_up_to_15_ai_agents_are_now/,Amazon trims HR by up to 15% — AI agents are now doing your invoice chasing. What next?,"So the prophecy is already mid-rollout: Amazon is reportedly preparing cuts affecting as much as 15% of its HR (PXT) staff while doubling down on generative AI and so-called “AI agents.” Meanwhile, AI tools are quietly slipping into finance teams, accelerating invoice collections and making the awkward human chase for late payments slightly less human.

If you’re a founder, indie hacker, or consultant, you’ve got a front-row seat to a workplace formerly run by humans now being lovingly refactored by machines and spreadsheets. The headline is simple and deliciously dystopian: faster processes, lower friction, and fewer people to blame when the automation breaks.

Why HR first? Because HR is abundant with repeatable, document-driven tasks: ticket triage, benefits admin, interview scheduling, policy lookups. Toss an AI agent into that mix and a surprising share of routine queries vanish. The result? A trimmed HR headcount and a whole new slate of “redeployment opportunities” that usually translate to internal job boards and LinkedIn-proof-of-life posts.

Invoice collection is the other unglamorous testbed. It’s rules-heavy, full of templates, and a perfect match for agents that can parse, match, and pester at scale — without coffee breaks or existential dread. When an autonomous agent sends the 3rd reminder and gets paid, CFOs rejoice. Payroll stays intact. Humans... less so.

Actionable takeaways for the sane and suspicious:
- Map tasks, not roles: Identify which repeatable tasks in your org are low-risk to automate (invoice matching, scheduling, FAQ handling). That’s where agents will strike first.
- Human-in-the-loop is your bargaining chip: Keep humans in escalation and quality roles — the parts that require judgment, empathy, or legal nuance.
- Build redeploy pipelines: Training in AI ops, data quality, and exception handling is the difference between layoffs and redeployments that look like growth.
- Productize your edge: If you enable better human-AI workflows, you build a moat. Selling sanity is still profitable.

We’re not enacting instant doom. But this is structural change, not a headline. Efficiency gets fetishized, then normalized. Jobs don’t vanish so much as migrate — into new roles, into the gig economy, or into the long tail of “consulting to retrain your workforce.”

Pay attention, but do not *go* there.

If you start looking at what is happening at scale — in the markets, for example — people are now way too hyped about the talking machine that can paint.

**""But we do not know yet what this thing is capable of yet, there are two narratives!""**

There are no narratives.

This is a tool.

Tools do not mean anything. A knife is defined by its wielder. The problem arises when people do not understand what the tool *is*, and I think this is what is now being forgotten.

First of all, when we say ""artificial intelligence,"" it really *means* ""the next cool technology."" It does not mean anything else. The current “artificial intelligence” points to LLMs, diffusion models, etc. The coolest of them actually take a very, very long jump into the physical world in the vision-to-language-to-action models.

They are magic — as in ""almost indistinguishable from an incredibly advanced form of technology.""

People tend to say that we need proof before we can say anything. But you don’t really need to prove anything when you criticize a formal system. See, for example, LLMs. They are, at the end of the day, an incredible combination of certain mathematical concepts (linear algebra, information theory, differential equations, and so on) combined with a lot of language data thrown in. In the end, this produces a ""symbol shuffler"" that is very, very good at predicting what word comes next when you say something.

But that’s it.

This is like in *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* when they build the machine to ""tell what is the meaning of the universe"" and it blurts out ""42."" What goes in, comes out.

It is an incredible piece of technology that will be good for these tasks:

* Very good at tasks with a high language component, such as routine chat work, machine translation, some coding tasks, searching, etc.
* Pretty good at tasks that involve some language use, such as reporting, documenting, deducing, or evaluating tasks in a limited context.
* Terrible at tasks with very little language component, such as anything involving human interaction (which, actually, is almost every single job that exists).

And it will actually be only at best mediocre (at worst dangerous) in those tasks with a high language component if you don’t really pay attention to what you’re doing — because you have a big, big, big temptation to get lazy and not pay attention.

Because LLMs are **nothing** but the biggest language game ever created. Their actual limits are still, of course, not known, and please keep on pushing them — but the hard limits are already there. The limits of LLMs are the limits of natural language. (Very, very many people, by the way, have thought about this in the last two thousand years, so you don’t have to do it yourself.)

The limits exist within all of these new models. The limits of these systems are the limits of *formalization*. Mathematics is a form of language game. But math is not physics. Musical notes are not music.

Because in the end, all they are is this: extremely sophisticated *printing presses* that reproduce and reshape “language” mathematically. The models are not “neural networks” or “agents” in the biological sense, but computational machines of relationships between symbols.

Some smart people will now start arguing, ""but this is what humans do."" And here I must tell those people — really? This is what you do? This is a good time then to go for a walk in the forest, drink a cup of coffee, play with your dog/kid, call a friend — you *choose*.

The problem is that we have a very strong tendency to associate ourselves with conscious reasoning — and yes, it does happen on some symbolic level — but now you are really thinking that *you* are the tool. But you are not the tool. You are the thing that can use those tools in a very, very smart and wise way.

You are the thing that MAKES SENSE out of these things. We are the ones who create the MEANING. Those machines can never, ever, ever do that for us.

But also, I am not saying that you shouldn’t use these. Of course you should use these tools and learn to use them. They can be very, very handy. Use LLMs where you have a hard time formalizing something into words.

Use Claude to do that refactoring, but make sure you really know what you’re doing, because you have to be very formal about what you’re doing. And I hope you know what you did afterwards, because I do not want to debug that.

Use diffusion models to create that background for the presentation about your sales case. But you still need to pitch it. You still need to sell it. You still need to emotionally connect with that customer. Understand their problem — and hopefully sell them something meaningful.

See: the problem isn’t the technology. It is us. It is what we are *doing* with the technology. The problem is that almost all current technology in the modern world is robbing you from introspection, self-searching, critical thinking, actually paying attention. Everything is demanding your attention and you are being slowly turned into a short-term reward association bundle machine.

Somehow, somewhere, for some reason, we collectively forgot what technology was supposed to be about — humans, and how to make our lives collectively better and more *meaningful*.

Maybe now is a good time to take a little break from your phone. Because that is the one of biggest things that is harming you currently. Almost all of the ""trendy"" software technology currently at large is doing a lot of harm to us.

It too, started beautifully and then somehow, somewhere, for some reason, we decided to turn the internet into a short-term attention span–hooking algorithm feeding into our minds 24/7. Let’s monetize it. Put ads there. Because that is really what we need: a billion people running after the next new thing.

This is horrible. Why did we build the Matrix? Seriously.

I would like to think that Silicon Valley is waking up from this horror, because everybody at some point really needs to prove their point in technology by making money out of it and showing where it is used and where it is helpful and where it *enables* the creation of meaning so that somebody wants to pay for it.

Is this really *the problem* we now need to solve?

This whole thing is unfortunately, a caricature of 1999. AI sucks. It has always sucked, and will always suck.

**NEW YORK** \- If it feels like your money isn’t stretching as far as it used to, you’re not imagining things. Groceries cost more, rent keeps climbing, and even that morning coffee seems to have gotten pricier. That’s inflation at work — the slow (and sometimes not-so-slow) rise in prices that quietly eats away at your purchasing power.



We’ve all felt the pinch lately. Whether you’re trying to keep your family budget on track, save for a big goal, or just make ends meet, inflation can make it feel like you’re swimming against the current. The good news? You don’t have to just ride it out and hope for the best. There are smart, practical steps you can take right now to protect your finances and stay ahead of rising costs.



In this article, we’ll walk through five simple but powerful strategies to help you deal with inflation — from adjusting your budget and tackling debt, to making smarter investments and boosting your earning power. You don’t need a finance degree or a six-figure salary to make these work — just a willingness to take a fresh look at how you manage your money.





Ready to stretch your dollars a little further and feel more in control again? Let’s dive in.



**1. Rework Your Budget to Match New Realities**



When prices go up, your old budget stops working — plain and simple. What used to cover a week’s worth of groceries might only last five days now. And that “extra” money you thought you had at the end of the month? It might have quietly disappeared into higher bills or fuel costs.





That’s why the first step in dealing with inflation is to revisit your budget. Think of it like giving your finances a health check-up. You don’t need to overhaul everything overnight, but you *do* need to make sure your money is being spent on what actually matters most right now.



Start by tracking your expenses for a month. It might sound tedious, but it’s eye-opening. Use a budgeting app like Mint, YNAB (You Need a Budget), or even a simple spreadsheet. Seeing where your cash is going — every coffee, every subscription, every takeout order — helps you spot leaks you didn’t know existed.



Next, separate your “needs” from your “wants.” Needs are your essentials: rent or mortgage, groceries, utilities, transportation, healthcare. Wants are the nice-to-haves: streaming services, takeout dinners, impulse online buys. During inflation, it’s okay to press pause on some wants so your needs stay fully covered.



Also, adjust your budget categories to reflect reality. Maybe groceries need a little more room while entertainment gets trimmed. The goal isn’t to cut out fun entirely — it’s to make sure you’re spending intentionally, not automatically.



And here’s a pro tip: build in a little buffer. Prices fluctuate, and having even a small cushion (say, 5–10% of your monthly spending) helps absorb surprises without blowing your whole plan.



Reworking your budget isn’t about restriction — it’s about *control*. Once you know exactly where your money’s going, you’ll feel less stressed and better prepared for whatever inflation throws your way next.



**2. Pay Down High-Interest Debt**



If there’s one thing inflation and rising interest rates *love* to do, it’s team up and make debt even more painful. When prices go up, central banks often raise interest rates to cool things down — and that means credit cards, personal loans, and variable-rate debts suddenly start costing you more.



In other words, if you’re carrying high-interest debt right now, it’s time to make it a top priority.



Start by listing out all your debts — how much you owe, what the interest rate is, and what the minimum payments are. Then, tackle the ones with the highest interest rates first. This is called the avalanche method, and it saves you the most money in the long run because you stop paying so much in interest.



If you’ve got multiple balances, consider consolidating them into a lower-rate loan or transferring your credit card balance to a 0% promo card (just make sure you pay it off before the promo period ends!). Refinancing or locking in a fixed-rate loan can also protect you from future rate hikes.



And most importantly — try not to take on new high-interest debt unless it’s absolutely necessary. Inflation makes everything pricier, but adding more monthly payments on top only makes it harder to keep up.



Think of it this way: every dollar you free up from interest payments is a dollar you can put toward something that actually benefits you — like savings, investments, or even just breathing room in your budget.



So, before you look for new ways to grow your money, make sure you’re not letting high-interest debt quietly eat it away. 



Paying down debt might not feel exciting, but it’s one of the safest, smartest inflation-fighting moves you can make.



**3. Invest in Inflation-Resilient Assets**



Let’s be real — when inflation is high, just saving money in a regular bank account can feel like trying to hold water in your hands. Prices go up, but your savings don’t. Over time, the money sitting in your account actually *loses* buying power. That’s why it’s so important to look at investing as part of your inflation game plan.



Now, don’t worry — you don’t need to become a day trader or gamble your savings on risky bets. The key is to put your money into assets that tend to grow faster than inflation or at least keep pace with it.



Here are a few places to start:



* Stocks (or index funds): Over the long term, the stock market has historically outpaced inflation. If you’re not already investing, consider low-cost index funds or ETFs that track the broader market. You don’t need to pick individual stocks — the goal is steady growth over time.



* Real estate: Property values and rents often rise along with inflation, which makes real estate a solid hedge. Even if you’re not buying a home or investment property, you can look into REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) to get real estate exposure without needing to be a landlord.



* TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities): These government bonds are designed specifically to protect against inflation. Their value adjusts with inflation, so your purchasing power stays more stable.



* Commodities and precious metals: Gold, silver, and even commodities like oil or agricultural products can sometimes rise when inflation does — though they can be a bit more volatile.



Whatever you do, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification is your best friend here. A balanced mix of investments helps smooth out the ups and downs while keeping your long-term goals in focus.





And remember: the worst time to make investment decisions is when you’re panicking. Inflation can make people rush into “hot tips” or risky trends (crypto, meme stocks — you name it), but slow and steady almost always wins the race.



The bottom line? Inflation may chip away at cash, but with the right investments, you can make your money work harder — and protect your future purchasing power in the process.



**4. Boost Your Earning Power**



Cutting costs can only take you so far — there’s a limit to how much you can save, but there’s *no limit* to how much you can earn. When prices are climbing, one of the best defenses against inflation is simply to make more money. Sounds easier said than done, right? But don’t worry — there are real, practical ways to do it.



**Start by looking at your current job.**

  
When was the last time you got a raise? If it’s been a while, inflation gives you a pretty solid reason to ask for one. Do a little research on what people in your role and industry are earning (websites like Glassdoor or Payscale can help), then make your case. Show how you’ve added value or taken on more responsibility — employers are often more open to adjustments when they see clear results.



If that’s not an option, it might be time to look for new opportunities. The job market is constantly shifting, and sometimes a move to a new company can mean a big pay bump.



Next, think about developing new skills — especially ones that are in high demand. Digital skills, project management, trades, or data analysis can all open doors to higher-paying roles. There are tons of free or affordable courses online that can help you level up (sites like Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, and Skillshare are great places to start).



And don’t forget about side hustles. Whether it’s freelancing, tutoring, selling products online, or even monetizing a hobby, extra income can go a long way toward cushioning the blow of rising prices.





Finally, consider passive income — things like dividend-paying investments, rental income, or creating digital products that earn money over time. It takes effort to set up, but it can really pay off down the line.



Here’s the bottom line: You can only cut so much from your budget, but there’s no ceiling on your earning potential. Every new skill, project, or side gig you take on builds your financial resilience — not just against inflation, but against whatever life throws your way.



**5. Shop Smarter and Plan Ahead**



When prices are climbing, every little bit of savings counts — and the good news is, small changes in how you shop can add up faster than you’d think. You don’t have to start clipping coupons like it’s 1995 (unless you want to!), but being a little more strategic with your spending can go a long way toward beating inflation.



Start with the basics: buy in bulk when it makes sense. Non-perishables like rice, pasta, paper products, and canned goods are often cheaper per unit when you buy bigger packages. 



Just make sure you’re stocking up on things you actually use — nobody needs a five-year supply of pickles.



Next, compare prices before you buy. With so many shopping apps and websites out there, it only takes a minute to check if that “sale” is really a deal. Tools like Honey or Rakuten can help you find discounts or earn cashback automatically.



Loyalty programs and store rewards cards can also be a quiet source of savings if you use them strategically. If you shop somewhere often, those points and cashbacks can add up to free groceries or discounts over time.



And here’s a big one — plan your meals. It sounds simple, but meal planning reduces waste, helps you shop only for what you need, and makes it easier to stick to your grocery budget. Fewer last-minute takeout runs mean more money stays in your pocket.



For big purchases — like appliances, furniture, or tech — wait it out if you can. Prices tend to fluctuate, and patience can pay off. Sign up for price alerts or wait for major sale periods like Black Friday or end-of-season clearance events.



Finally, think ahead. If you know prices are likely to rise on something you use regularly — like fuel, pet food, or household items — grab a little extra now while it’s still cheaper. Just be smart about storage and avoid overbuying perishable goods.



The key idea here is this: inflation doesn’t have to catch you off guard. A little planning and intentional shopping can help you stretch your dollars further and keep your financial stress in check.

Last month, I (F18) went to my cousin’s birthday party with no intention of meeting anyone or getting into something romantic. I was just there to enjoy and spend time with my family and friends. But during the party, I ended up talking with one of my cousin’s friends (M20) for more than an hour. We talked about our college life, our universities, and even my past relationship. I didn’t think he liked me at all. In fact, his friends were teasing him with my best friend who was with me, so I assumed she was the one he liked.

When I asked if he had a girlfriend, he said no. He even denied liking my best friend and asked me to go to the gym with him sometime. I just said, “If I’m not busy,” since I go to the gym regularly anyway. Honestly, I thought he was just being friendly and maybe a little drunk. Romance wasn’t on my mind at all.

Then suddenly, he held my hand. I froze. There were many people around, including my protective cousins, and I felt so uncomfortable. I kept pulling away and reminding him that my cousins were nearby, but he kept reaching for my hand again. I would move to different tables just to get away from him, but whenever I went back, he would do it again. I felt uneasy and didn’t know what to do.

My best friend noticed and told me that people could already see what was happening. I told her I knew, but I didn’t want to cause a scene. I was scared of how my cousins would react. I asked my cousin’s girlfriend to help me, and when I returned to the table, he tried holding my hand again. That was when my male cousin called me over to another table, and I realized he saw what was going on and was trying to get me away quietly.

I joined my cousin’s girlfriend, and they told me they had seen it earlier but were just waiting for the right time to help. I was so thankful for them. One of my cousins wanted to confront the guy, but I begged him not to, trying to stay calm and avoid drama. I told them to just let it go since the guy was drunk.

After that, I didn’t go back to his table. But later that night, he texted me, asking me to come back, I didn’t. The next morning, he messaged again, and that’s when I started to assume he liked me. He kept talking about going to the gym or having coffee together. I wasn’t really interested, so I didn’t entertain him much, though a small part of me was curious, I thought he didn’t have anyone. I expected that if he did, my cousin or his friends would have told me.

We kept texting, and he would flirt with me sometimes, but he also kept saying things like, “Let’s just be friends for now.” One day, he asked me out for coffee, and I finally said okay, but then he told me not to post anything about it. That’s when my instincts kicked in. I instantly knew something was wrong. He asked if my cousin knew that we were talking, and I said no. Then he said, “That’s good.” That was a huge red flag for me. I told him directly that if he had a girlfriend or was entertaining someone else, he needed to tell me, because if he did, it would already be cheating, and I didn’t want to be part of that. He insisted that we were just friends and that yes, he was talking to other girls, but there was “no malice” between us. But how could he say that when he had held my hand and flirted with me?

So I said no and stopped replying to him, even when he kept messaging me like nothing happened. I was hurt, not because I liked him deeply, but because I felt disgusted that I had let him hold my hand and, without realizing it, I might have hurt another woman. I know how that feels because I was also cheated on in my past relationship.

I asked my girl best friend to find out from his friends if he had a girlfriend, but they became defensive, which made my instincts even stronger. I didn’t have any proof yet, but I already knew deep down that there was someone else.

The day after the party, he posted something on Facebook, and a woman I was familiar with commented on it. I instantly suspected something. I asked my friends to check her account, but it was locked, so I let it be. Then, just yesterday, he messaged me again, asking me to go play billiards with him. I replied, “You should tell that to your girlfriend,” and left him on seen.

Earlier today, my cousin, the one who had the birthday, met up with me. He confirmed that the guy does have a girlfriend. They said they wanted to tell me sooner, but I was busy with school and they couldn’t reach me. When they mentioned the name of the university his girlfriend studies at, I immediately thought of a girl I knew. She was familiar to me because we graduated from the same high school. We weren’t friends, but we had interacted before. She’s known for being outspoken and a bit warfreak.

I confirmed it with my cousin, and he said yes, she was the girlfriend. My heart sank. I wanted to tell her, but I’m scared. There are pictures my cousins and friends took during the party, and I’m terrified they might get leaked or posted online. I have a sensitive image, I study at a strict Catholic school, I’m a scholar, and somewhat of a public figure. I’m afraid that if I tell her, I might be the one blamed or humiliated.

I don’t know what to do. Should I message her using my account, tell her anonymously, or talk to her in person? I have screenshots showing how I didn’t want him to hold my hand and how he flirted with me. I just don’t know the right thing to do — I’m scared, but I also feel guilty for staying silent. I want to tell her but I don’t know how.

Chris sighed and shook his head at the mirror. “I look like a penguin.”

In the quiet confines of our tent, he stood before a cracked mirror we’d scrounged from an abandoned house, while the woodstove in the corner crackled merrily on its embers. It wasn’t much of a shelter, but it kept the cold away and we never had snow fall on us, so that was a plus. There was enough room for our crude bed, a simple bunk knocked together from scrap lumber bearing a mattress stuffed full of old rags. Our floor had been fashioned out of wooden pallets to hold everything off the frozen mud, and a rectangular pine chest contained most of our meager belongings. During the day, our homemade wood stove put out enough heat to keep the tent fairly warm, while at night it struggled to keep ice from forming on the tent poles. We were fortunate, I knew; there were still so many out there that had nothing, despite how hard our forces worked to put more old houses bac in working order. Chris wanted to wait until he was sure most of the general populace had somewhere to go before he arranged for our own home, and I’d grown used to sleeping under several blankets. With him by my side every night, snuggled by the glow of a fire, it wasn’t so bad.

*Though I won’t mind once we have a real door that can lock. And a fireplace. And a toilet.*

With gentle hands I straightened his tie, taking in the way the suit fit him like a glove. “No, you look *handsome.* It fits you. Very distinguished.”

“So, a very distinguished penguin then.” He let slide an ornery grin and pulled me to him, both calloused hands on my waist so that my spine tingled in pleasant shivers. “You sure you can’t come early? There’s got to be room enough on the helicopter for one more.”

*Tempting, Mr. Dekker, very tempting.*

I took his face in my hands to kiss him and savored how my brain fuzzed with happy static at the sensation. “I’ll be there once everything is set here. We still have to lay groundwork for the new perimeter wall and a food storage bunker. Then there’s taking measurements for the cabins, a watchtower and—hey!”

He lifted me from the ground to settle us both down amongst the tangled sheets of our bunk with mischievous gleam in his sky-blue eyes. I had barely a second to think before his lips were on mine again, a delicious warmth in my core that by now was a familiar and welcome feeling.

“You’re. . . you’re going to be late.” I gasped as he made his way down the soft skin of my neck, our hands in a blind race to undo belts and shirt buttons.

“A president is allowed to be late.” Chris whispered in my ear and cupped a hand behind my hip to keep me tight against his body. We were both still sore with bruises from the battle for the Western Pass, but time had helped to soothe most of the worst injuries. My ankle still hurt, and it would take longer to heal than I wanted, but I didn’t need to put much stress on it for this. Clearly my husband didn’t mind his new scars enough to care either.

Running my hands over the raised bits of skin that crisscrossed his muscled chest, I gave him a playful nibble on the shoulder, conscious to avoid where sutures held fresh wounds together. “You could tear those stiches.”

His energy only heightened by my teasing, Chris discarded the last bit of fabric that kept him at bay to pull the blankets over us in a soft cocoon of linen and wool. “If you want me to stop . . .”

*Don’t you dare.*

Unable to muster any words for the way his skin felt on mine, I laced my arms around his neck and happily gave up trying to dissuade him.

Twenty minutes later, we lay side-by-side in the thoroughly rumpled bed, his suit laid out in various discarded pieces on the nearby chair, my own nightshirt lost somewhere in the blankets. Thankfully, all bandages and sutures held, the stiffness in some of my wounds fading to a drowsy contentment. Chris tucked a thick fur coverlet over us, and I rested my tangled head against his chest, shutting my eyes to bask in the moment.

*Practice certainly makes perfect.*

“I still wish we could go together.” He stroked my hair, and Chris stared up at the tent ceiling with a grim line across his lips.

Spreading my fingers across his chest, I watched the short dark hairs flatten under my palm and chewed on my lower lip in thought. As the new president of the Free American Republic, Chris had many challenges on his hands. His first order of business had been to draft and sign into effect an official Constitution for our fledgling nation, one built off the principles of the original we’d grown up with in the U.S. With the Bill of Rights restored, curfews lifted, and market reforms implemented, Chris’s popularity soared amongst the surviving population. Many local businesses reopened, the streets were cleaned of rubble, and food shortages began to wane. A joint effort between the withdrawing ELSAR forces and our own soldiers had seen the power grid restored across Black Oak, and we managed to get the water mains back online. Sewage no longer flowed in the streets, and the number of disease patients in the hospital began to go down.

Still, our greatest accomplishment was, without a doubt, the new Constitution, and I myself had been among the delegates to sign the document. It had been one of the proudest days of my life to stand beside my husband as our dream became a reality, to see Chris’s eyes twinkle with hope for the future, and to walk out onto the courthouse lawn with him to greet the cheering crowds. We’d run up our new flag, red and white striped like the old one, but with a white pine tree in the blue square instead of fifty stars, and someone had even found a stash of old fireworks to shoot off in celebration.

However, like all things, it was not a bloodless victory. With the relaxing of political suppression, the new two-house Assembly had formed ideological blocs that began to look eerily like political parties. Our own Reformists, led by Chris, made up roughly 2/3 of the total government, but a rival group of former collaborators known as the Provincials proved to be a thorn in our side. They refused to sign the new Constitution until Chris promised amnesty to most former Auxiliaries in return for a guarantee of Provincial support in reconstruction. This had in turn enraged many of the former resistance members, who splintered into other factions; most went to the Independents, but sadly a large number defected to the United Liberation Front.

Formed by Josh and his insurgent comrades, the ULF demanded the total removal of all former collaborator families from Barron County by force, the execution of all Auxiliaries and Organ members, and the handing of military authority in Black Oak to ULF forces. All efforts to negotiate with them failed, and when the Assembly refused to allow them representation in both House and Senate due to their aggressive tactics, the ULF denounced our government as illegitimate. They carried out three separate car bomb attacks on our security units in Black Oak and tried to vandalize warehouse where our aid was stored in order to prevent it from reaching the poorer districts. Chris had officially declared them a terrorist organization which meant that, in a strange twist of fate, our troops ended up patrolling alongside the last of the ELSAR soldiers before the latter’s withdrawal to keep the bloodshed at a minimum. While there were multiple ULF attacks to investigate, my scouts reported having trouble with an unidentified sniper who harassed our police units without end, and I dreaded the day I would look down my rifle sights to find Lucille staring back at me. We had won the war, but it seemed true peace would continue to elude us for quite some time.

Still, not all was dark in the road ahead. As the Secretary of Human Welfare for Chris’s cabinet, Sandra Abernathy worked night and day to restore medical services within the town and acted as an envoy to the most impoverished districts in order to gain their support for further reforms. Ethan Sanderson won over the working class with ease, mediating between them and local business owners for pay, benefits, and improved conditions, thus avoiding multiple strikes. He’d wanted to go back to being a simple mechanic, but Chris eventually convinced him to accept the role of Vice President, for which Ethan turned out to be well suited. Black Oak University had been renamed the Carheim Institute, and with a book donation campaign from surviving residents, the old library was brought back to its former glory. I had a painting of Professor Carheim done by one of his former apprentices from the underground, and it hung just inside the entrance along with an inscription in old Latin that read, ‘Those who reach for the light of truth have no need to fear the darkest of lies.’

The real surprise came when one of the newspapers, a Provincial-friendly one no less, ran a story about our soldiers protecting civilians from reprisals during the siege of Black Oak.

In a shock to me, one of the interviewees happened to mention my name, and somehow a picture of me running down the street during the northern district massacre appeared in one of the local magazines, likely taken from a refugee that had been hidden in the bombed-out houses. Just like that, I went from a secondary figure in the new government to a pseudo-celebrity, and my face appeared on pro-reconstruction posters all over the city. Stylists copied the golden streaks in my hair for dozens of girls, tattoo artists ran out of silver ink due to sheer demand, and it got to where I was more worried about being mobbed by fans than attacked by insurgents every time I went anywhere. I found that I hated being so famous, unable to move about in town without an armed escort, but it did come in handy with the one project other I led inside the walls of Black Oak.

At the center of town, in the same square so many had been killed during the fighting, I had a temporary wooden pillar erected in place of a stone one that would replace it in future, once our quarries were operational. Onto this pillar, I carved the names of all the recovered coalition dog tags and captured ELSAR ID cards I had, along with every single name in Kaba’s little black book. He was given the place of honor at the top, *Adrit Veer Kabanagarajan*, along with *Andrea Louise Campbell,* and *Sean Fredrick Hammond*. Without any records as to his real name, I put *Tex* there as well, knowing he wouldn’t have wanted much spotlight anyway. I invited everyone from all sides in the Assembly to the opening ceremony and gave them the chance to write down the name of a loved one they would like to see etched onto the pillar. It didn’t matter who they were, which side they were on, or why they had died; the pillar was for everyone, for all the lost souls who hadn’t lived through the nightmare we’d barely survived. I called it Remembrance Square, and never a day went by that there wasn’t some kind of wreath, bouquet, or candle left at its base by a grieving family. It wasn’t much, but as Chris assured me, it was the first in a long series of steps towards healing.

“I’ll be there before dark.” I curled one leg around him and clung to Chris’s torso with both arms to soak in the heat radiating off his chiseled frame. “Once I know New Wilderness is secure for the night, I’ll come find you. I promise.”

He planted a tender kiss on my forehead. “I’ll hold you to that. First Ladies need to keep their promises. Besides, once the new road is paved, we can move the presidential residence out here and avoid the traffic altogether.”

That drew a smile from me, both in the thought of living closer to the reserve, and at the idea that our cozy little farm wasn’t so far in the future. “Not sold on being an urbanite, huh?”

“My grandfather had it right.” Chris rubbed my shoulder and stared upward through the green canvas ceiling in thought. “A sturdy house, a good piece of land, and a beautiful family is more than enough in this life. Once my term is up, I figure if you won’t mind helping me build the house, I can get us the land, and then maybe we can work on that last part some more.”

*I think we’re well past ‘maybe’, Mr. Dekker.*

My face heated up, and I kept both eyes on his satin-steel chest to avoid giving my giddy smile away. “I’d like that.”

We lay there for another few minutes, before my battered alarm clock rang to inform us that he was, in fact, late. Together we rose to repeat the dressing process, and I shrugged on my new uniform, eyeing the golden stars on the collar in the nearby mirror.

With the war over, and the bulk of the coalition army disbanded, those who didn’t want a place in the budding government went their separate ways. Adam and Eve returned with the remainder of their brethren to Ark River, where Eve made sure her recovering husband got his rest, whether Adam felt he needed it or not. Their patrols continued to round up Puppets in order to redeem them via sunlight, though multiple Arkian women discovered they were pregnant shortly after the Breach’s collapse, and fresh marriages continued in their enclave by the day. Many of the original population of Barron County stayed in Ark River, while others traveled west to join the growing flock of people looking to reconquer the gated community near Sunbright. Some moved to Black Oak, but a few dared to venture out into the wild, with hopes of building their own fortified blockhouses, miniature settlements, or farming strongholds in the vast unclaimed lands of the countryside. Untainted by the continuous influence of the Breach, the landscape stabilized, and the tide of mutants slowed. Now it was time for mankind to do what we did best; regroup, rearm, and take back our home.

“Morning, Mr. President; the transport flight is ready at the landing pad, awaiting your orders.” As we emerged from the military surplus tent, a green-uniformed ranger came up and saluted us both. “Commander Dekker, we’ve got a supply convoy that just came in, and the captain asked where you wanted the radios to go?”

It took a moment for me to remember that he was addressing *me*, and I nodded toward the line of vehicles parked on the other side of the ridge, where bulldozers rumbled back and forth to smooth out the shell craters. “Talk to Head Ranger McPhearson. Tell him I’ll be helping with the wall construction detail this afternoon, before my flight to the capitol this evening. He’ll be briefed before I leave.”

“Yes, commander.” The boy saluted again and took off at a run.

I turned to find Chris watching me with a toothy smile. “What?”

He shook his head and slipped one hand into mine as we walked. “I do *not* miss my old post.”

“And I do *not* envy your current one.” Leaning on him to keep the weight off my sore ankle, I strode with Chris down the newly bladed road between the tents, snowflakes tumbling around us. Our medics had provided me with a cane to use until the wound healed, but while I carried it even now, I hated using the thing. It made me feel old, and I couldn’t wait until I didn’t need the creaking stick anymore. “Those Assembly sessions drive me crazy. I don’t know how you get through them without wanting to shoot someone.”

“Trust me, it’s crossed my mind.” Chris’s face dimmed somewhat, and he let out a long sigh. “But I think once enough time passes, the old problems will sort themselves out. Our first civil war didn’t end us, and we had a lot more to deal with this time around.”

Pacing through the camp, we looked on in mute thought at the fervent construction that bustled all around us. Crews worked tirelessly to operate heavy equipment, lay gravel, and haul logs to their various positions. Unlike the old New Wilderness, this one would be larger, encompassing the entire hill the reserve originally sat on, with rings of palisade walls guarding it from base to crest. Once the spring came, we planned to pour cement foundations and bring in large stone blocks from the local quarry, replacing the wooden fort with a stone castle that would outlast us all. It would serve both as a conservation center for the animal species that roamed our newborn republic, and as a command post for our peacetime military, of which I was now chief officer. Some of the structures being rebuilt were given their old names: Carnivore Cove, the Fur and Fang Veterinary Center, the Herbivore Barns. It was with a strange combination of melancholy and closure that I observed the workers raise framed walls on the central barracks, which bore the name “Elk Lodge.” In truth, it would be closer to a medieval keep by the time it was done properly in stone next spring. Part of me would always miss the old rustic lodge, where Chris and I shared our first dance, our first kiss, and our first clumsy attempt at a dinner date. It would never truly be the same . . . but then again, none of this would be. We were about to pass into a different world, a different time, and everything was once again going to change.

Reaching the helicopter pad, a flattened part of the small ridge where a Blackhawk waited, Chris stopped to adjust his tie in the way he always did before going into another heated Assembly meeting. “I’ll see you tonight, then?”

My heart skipped a fluttery beat, and I took the lapels of his suit in my hands to kiss the boy who dug me out of the moldy pile of shoes all those nights ago. “I guarantee it.”

Chris rested his forehead against mine and bore into my eyes with his. “I love you, *pragtige*.”

“And I love you, *aantreklik*.” I held him tight, satisfied at the way my rough attempt at Afrikaans made him smile. “Be safe.”

A part of my heart twinged as the helicopter whirred off to the north, but I hefted the rifle on my shoulder and made for the front gate. There, a small caravan waited for me, made up of riders on horses, bicycles, motorcycles, and a few wagons drawn by oxen. Every saddlebag bulged with supplies, the wagons piled high with everything the group might need. Tools, provisions, water, medicine, no expense had been spared. Such extravagances would be unheard of tomorrow, the first day Barron County would wake up in a new reality, cut off from ELSAR’s mandated contributions.

*But it’s not tomorrow yet.*

At my approach, a rather conspicuous figure jumped down from the lead wagon to make a sweeping bow.

“Didn’t expect you to be up, commander. Thought you decided to take the morning off.” Even with his broad hat in one hand, head bent in dramatic flair, I could still see the wry grin on Peter’s face. “Though by the look of the president’s suit, you almost did, eh?”

“Something like that.” I chuckled as he righted himself and eyed the pirate’s revitalized getup. “I like the hat.”

Peter again wore the long-tailed coat, knee-high boots, and gleaming silver rapier of a 17^(th) century buccaneer, adding a tricorn hat that someone found atop his bandana-wrapped head. A single feather poked from its silken band, and with the dark stubble lining his thin face, Peter certainly looked roguish enough to appear in a movie set somewhere. One piece of his kit was not for mere appearances, however. Over his left eye, Peter now sported a black eyepatch, the long red scar extended from either side denoting where Grapeshot’s cutlass had made its mark. Our medics tended to it the best they could, but Peter knew as well as they did that he would never see with his left eye again. Still, it hadn’t dampened his spirits.

If anything, it made him more of a rascal than ever.

Behind him, the last of those who were going south lounged on their various mounts, talking or sipping on hot coffee provided by the camp mess. In a shrewd political maneuver, Chris used the Provincials’ amnesty demand for the Organs as a loophole to waive the life sentence for Peter and his crew. Officially free men, they were granted letters of marque as privateers of the F.A.R Naval Forces. Granted, they were the *only* naval force we had, but Peter had accepted the task before the Assembly with great charm, stirring more than one adoring newspaper article written by swooning girls. Set to return to the *Harper’s Vengeance*, they would patrol the Sea of Sargosia (formerly Maple Lake) on behalf of our government, ferrying settlers to abandoned farm sites or protecting researchers while they studied mutant migrations. As well, they would aid in keeping any form of banditry off our waters, especially since a large portion of ex-Organ members had elected to leave Black Oak and move into the countryside for fear of the ULF. Many orphans volunteered to join him when Peter opened a recruitment line in the local pub, and they all looked forward to a new life on our growing inland sea.

One face in particular stuck out of the caravan, and I limped over to crane my neck at the silent figure atop the lead wagon’s seat. “Hey, you. All ready to go?”

Tarren didn’t say anything, but nodded, twisted a few thin strands of vine in her fingers to form knots. She hadn’t very much spoken since the Breach, and never smiled, a quiet shadow of the girl I’d met in the hold of the *Harper’s Vengeance.* It hurt to see, and I knew Peter was most affected by it, though he tried not to let the pain show. Of anyone, Tarren was least deserving of what she had endured, but the war had shown no favoritism to anyone.

*Curse Vecitorak and his filthy rotten soul.*

I rested my elbows on the wagon’s side and made a conspiratorial whisper in a bid to cheer her up. “I heard they’ve got an ice cream shop set to open in Black Oak. I’ll bring some with me when I come to visit, and we can eat crunchy cones together. Maybe after, you can take a trip here and pet a mammoth. They’re like elephants, but fuzzier. Sound good?”

The girl chewed her lower lip, but bobbed her head in agreement, and continued to tie knots in silence.

“Okay.” Somewhat disappointed, I turned to go, but to my surprise, a little jerk on my sleeve halted my steps.

Tarren held her arms out for a hug, and I didn’t deny her.

“I don’t sleep good.” Her whisper in my ear broke my heart, raspy from disuse and fatigue.

*I know the feeling.*

Rubbing her back, I held her tight, and felt a sympathetic wince cross my face. “Nightmares?”

She nodded, skinny fingers gripping my uniform epaulets like they were lifelines.

“I have them too.” I kissed her hair and wished I could keep the little thing with me, though I knew she was better off with her crew . . . her family. “But you want to know a secret?”

Tarren looked at me with watery eyes, on the edge of tears that she’d likely shed a thousand times already. Few could know what she’d been through, the feeling of the roots burrowing inside her skin the pain, the whispers in her mind. I had been fortunate never to fully succumb to the infection, but she had spent hours, days, weeks in the clutches of the Oak Walker’s growth. Still, I knew how it felt, and in that way, we were closer than sisters, bonded in memories too horrible to forget. I wouldn’t let her trod that path alone.

Leaning close, I produced a little wooden pendant I’d carved from a chunk of pine, crude and angular, but sanded smooth enough to prevent splinters. It was a lantern, a tiny wooden lantern with the inside of the vault painted with gold to stand in for a flame. While I didn’t get much down time, there were moments of darkness for me too, nights when I woke up in a cold sweat, or brief instants of panic that hit me out of nowhere in random places. Thanks to helping Chris with a new batch of miniatures for his Christmas outreach program, carving had become my nervous tick in those times, and I didn’t know why, but my mind always went back to that golden lantern, shining in the night. Like the one I’d seen in a different place, held by different hands, perhaps this too would help guide Tarren home.

“Whenever you can’t sleep.” I handed her the pendant and closed her little fingers over it. “Light a candle and hold this tight as you can. When you do, I want you to say one thing to yourself, out loud, until you feel better again.”

Her face contorted in a mix of hope and confusion, Tarren waiting for the necessary words that must have sounded like a magic recipe to her young mind.

Seeing a pair of gentle silver irises in my mind, I rubbed one thumb over the little girl’s cheek to wipe the tears away. “*You have no idea how loved you are*.”

I had to her repeat it back to me until Tarren could say it without stumbling over the words. She thanked me with another hug, and it took a superhuman force of willpower just to walk away. However, when I looked back over my shoulder, Tarren was peering at the lantern in her hands, lips moving with the silent mantra, eyes filled with something like hope.

*He can hear you, Tarren. He’s right there. Just look closer.*

As we walked to the front of the lineup, Peter glanced at me out of the corner of his one good eye. “You sure ya don’t need us to stick around for a few more days? Me and the lads don’t mind the heavy liftin.”

“The snow’s going to get deeper the longer we wait.” I thumped along with my cane, a bittersweet frown on my face as we stopped next to the poles that would soon become our main gate. “I’m sure the *Harper’s Vengeance* will need repairs before she can put to sea again, and the roads from here to there won’t be easy. Chris and I will come visit as soon as we can.”

“I’ll have to build a spare room in the fort then.” Peter rested his hand on the hilt of Grace’s rapier, the ornate sword hanging from his hip, and I noted how calm he seemed. The old weariness, torment, and sadness were long gone, and Peter gobbled up the morning sunshine with hungry eyes. He was ready, ready for a fresh start, a new life.

*Hopefully a long and happy one.*

“You know, I never did ask.” Staring out alongside him onto the white, snow-covered hills around us, I rested both hands on my cane for support. “You last name . . . what is it?”

“Nelson.” He smirked, and Peter made a modest shrug. “Peter G. Nelson. Honestly never had much use for it, ‘specially once I turned pirate; imagine a pirate named Nelson.”

“Maybe not a pirate.” I raised one eyebrow and recalled something Chris had told me once during our early dates at New Wilderness. “But there was a famous admiral by that name. Even had a statue of him put up in Britain somewhere.”

“Ya don’t say?” Peter’s good eye twinkled in wonder. “Well, I suppose I’ll have to read up on that, if we ever find more books. The crew could use some new stories . . . who knows, maybe I’ll try and write one for them.”

“I look forward to reading a copy.” At my wave, the rest of his caravan mounted up, and I met Peter’s eye one last time. “Fair sailing to you, Captain Nelson.”

Mounting his own horse at the front of the wagons, Peter tipped his hat with a cavalier grin and tossed one of my uniform collar pins to me that I hadn’t realized was missing. “Until next time, Commander Dekker.”

Alone, I trudged back through the camp to a quiet spot on the eastern edge of the hilltop. Here a small cherry tree had survived the ELSAR barrage that destroyed the rest of its brethren in the artisanal grove, and with most people a fair distance off, I sat down on a large stone dumped by our earth-moving crew.

Placing my rifle to one side, I slid the camera strap off my shoulder and set up a small tripod one of the mechanics fashioned for me. I popped in the last SD card I had, two plastic containers full of them in my camera case and positioned the lens to face me.

My thumb hit *record,* and I sat back on the stone to clear my throat. “So, um . . . this is going to be my last video. I want to state for the record that I am not suicidal, this is not a death note, and I am in good health. This is . . . well, this is me saying goodbye.”

A hard wave of emotion hit me at that word, and I had to blink back the mixed feelings as I thought of what I was doing.

*Focus, Hannah. This is important. You can do this, you have to.*

“Everything you need to know should be recorded in the memory cards.” Staring at the tiny image of myself in the side screen, I looked back into the dark lens, holding up a stack of papers, notebooks, and files. “Along with a complete roster of the accounts collected by Professor Carheim. I also had one of the girls at the university transcribe my recordings on one of the computers we got shipped in during ELSAR’s last aid convoy, so everything is in paper form too. There should be two sets of each in the box.”

Cold wind blew a light dusting of snowflakes over my shoulder, and I watched them dance across the scene before me. They were beautiful, clean and white, as if washing away the scars of the old world. Somehow, they made me feel stronger, and I pushed myself onward.

“If you’re watching this, then you know what to do.” I nodded at the camera, as if I were speaking directly to the person I would entrust the dossier to. “The memory cards I will go to my parents, Allen and Margerie Brun, along with one of the transcript copies. As agreed, you keep one of the paper copies of everything, and you can post or publish them however you see fit, just so long as the truth is told. I’m counting on you, so . . . please, don’t let me down.”

One of the Smugglers from the old resistance, a man who had distinguished himself in the war, had sworn he could slip across the border before the Breach took us. Due to our agreement with ELSAR, we had forbidden such things, but I secretly agreed to let this man go, if he did me one very special favor. I had remembered a contact on the other side, an old acquaintance that knew me from a summer job in my high school days, and one I was confident would be trustworthy. In return for getting both packages to this special contact, the Smuggler and his family would be escorted to the border and snuck through the ELSAR checkpoints to freedom. Then, my old coworker would hopefully do as I asked and send one of the packets to my parents, before posting everything he’d been given online. By the time ELSAR reacted, it would be too late, and the world would know the truth. Most would laugh it off, many dismiss it as mere fiction, but some would believe, and that was enough. Koranti wouldn’t be able to hide forever, and mankind would have a chance, if a slim one, to fight back. It was a risky gamble, but I’d made worse decisions than that before.

*We’ll be ancient history by tomorrow anyway.*

Looking at my hands, I drew a deep, shuddery breath, and tried not to envision how much blood they had shed. “Now, I want to speak directly to my mom and dad.”

My heart beat a thousand miles a minute, as if they would step out from behind the camera to surprise me, but I straightened up and thought of their loving faces. “If you’ve watched the other videos, or read the transcript, then you’ve heard my story up to now. As much as it seems like some crazy hoax, as much as you’ll want to believe it’s all fake, please, trust what I’ve told you. I am alive, and I’m safe.”

A tear managed to crest my left eyelid, but I brushed it away stubbornly. “I wish you could have met Chris. I know you would have liked him, Dad. He would have been so nervous to meet you, but I think you would have gotten along. He’s good to me, kind, gentle. He reminds me of you, sometimes.”

Still the feelings rose in my throat, tried to choke me, and I fought not to sob. “Mom, I . . . I miss you. There’s a video from our wedding in one of the SD cards, I guess someone had a working camera and thought to record it all. I know we didn’t always get along, but I hope I made you proud. I wouldn’t be who I am if it weren’t for you. I know we’ll see each other again someday, even if not the way you’d want.”

Pain, old and familiar at this point, grew in my chest, a coarse sensation that wanted to stifle me. I couldn’t let it. This was too important. I had to carry on, to finish this.

They had to be told.

*Give me strength, Adonai.*

“I love you both, more than you could ever know.” I squeezed my eyes shut, and my voice cracked as hot salty waves rolled down my cheeks. “I always will. That’s why I wanted to make this recording just for you, because you deserve to know something.”

Across my face came a smile, a real smile, one that burst with the secret whispered to me in the sunlit meadows of Tauerpin Road. “You’re going to be grandparents. I know, it should be too soon to tell, but let’s just say I have it on good authority. I haven’t told Chris yet, I want to surprise him. If it’s a boy, I’d like to name him Rodrick, after Chris’s grandfather. If it’s a girl . . .”

The breeze rustled my hair, sending strands of brown and gold twirling before my eyes. Despite the winter chill, it almost seemed warm, as if from a distant summer memory, and I glanced down at the rifle by my side. While heavier than my old Type 9, the Kalashnikov gleamed under a thin coat of oil, scuffed and scratched, but reliable. Across the ground in front of me, dozens upon dozens of picture frames stood amongst the snow, staked into the ground under the cherry tree with a multitude of smiling faces. They had been copied at the university by one of the few remaining printers, encased in laminate to guard against the weather. Names were painted on the frames under each, and the one closest to me bore a man and a girl with similar facial features. Their bleach-blonde hair played in the sunlight, their uniform shirts boasting ‘New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve’ on the pocket, and tucked into the frame alongside it, was our picture.

*Man, that cake was good, wasn’t it? I never danced so much in my whole life. The dress you got me was so beautiful too . . .*

Laughing as I wept, I let grief mingle with joy until both melded into a torrent of feeling, not painful so much as grateful. Perhaps someday I would grow old so that the places, times, and dates faded into obscurity, but a part of me knew I could never forget the ones who guided me here.

Here, where I was always meant to be.

“If it’s a girl . . .” Resting my gaze on the camera, I let the wind whisper in my ear, the sun warm on my face, and breathed deep the air of my country as it caressed the cherry tree. “. . . I’m going to call her Jamie.”",1,1760621845.0,cant_sleep,0,1.0,False

Having trouble with most new games, and I knew I would have to cross this bridge at some point!","I have a Z390 Pro4 motherboard. I have 2 sticks of 8gb RAM and an i5 9600k processor, and a 2080 graphics card. I cannot play BF6 even on the lowest possible setting, but I meet the minimum specs. I think i just don't have enough VRAM in my graphics card to run the game, as I run in slow motion while playing and when I'm in the menu I get a warning that basically says this. However, I don't think I can just upgrade my graphics card but I want to be sure I'm making the right upgrade.

 So most of the specs and advice I can get is in google, but I still want some advice. I want to upgrade from my i5 processor, it is a [Intel Core i5-9600K Coffee Lake 6-Core 3.7 GHz (4.6 GHz Turbo) LGA 1151 (300 Series) 95W BX80684I59600K Desktop Processor](https://store.yahoo.com/outletpc/cv4205.html) and I've just bought the Corsair vengeance 16gb x 2 RAM cards to replace the 8gb RAM cards that I have right now. My question is, do I need to even upgrade my processor to something like an i9 9900KS? Is this all just a problem with my graphics card and should I just return that RAM? Or can I get away with just replacing my RAM sticks? Again, I want to be careful to not just get double the RAM but also need to make a parallel upgrade somewhere else. My PSU is a corsair 750x. I have the same question for graphics cards - can I just upgrade to a better card that isn't the latest most expensive one? I'm trying to keep all of this below 500 dollars and I doubt it's possible. I may just have to refund BF6 on steam until I can justify the cost of building a new PC later down the line.

I plan on formatting a USB drive so I can install the newest BIOS update for my motherboard so I can support a better processor but if the consensus is that I don't need a new processor then I won't get one (my performance in most games is OK but sometimes I think it's a processor issue and not a graphics card issue). 

Anyway, I built this PC in 2019. None of the parts are even close to current. 

Would like some help. Thank you!",1,1760621789.0,PcBuildHelp,0,1.0,False

Chris sighed and shook his head at the mirror. “I look like a penguin.”

In the quiet confines of our tent, he stood before a cracked mirror we’d scrounged from an abandoned house, while the woodstove in the corner crackled merrily on its embers. It wasn’t much of a shelter, but it kept the cold away and we never had snow fall on us, so that was a plus. There was enough room for our crude bed, a simple bunk knocked together from scrap lumber bearing a mattress stuffed full of old rags. Our floor had been fashioned out of wooden pallets to hold everything off the frozen mud, and a rectangular pine chest contained most of our meager belongings. During the day, our homemade wood stove put out enough heat to keep the tent fairly warm, while at night it struggled to keep ice from forming on the tent poles. We were fortunate, I knew; there were still so many out there that had nothing, despite how hard our forces worked to put more old houses bac in working order. Chris wanted to wait until he was sure most of the general populace had somewhere to go before he arranged for our own home, and I’d grown used to sleeping under several blankets. With him by my side every night, snuggled by the glow of a fire, it wasn’t so bad.

*Though I won’t mind once we have a real door that can lock. And a fireplace. And a toilet.*

With gentle hands I straightened his tie, taking in the way the suit fit him like a glove. “No, you look *handsome.* It fits you. Very distinguished.”

“So, a very distinguished penguin then.” He let slide an ornery grin and pulled me to him, both calloused hands on my waist so that my spine tingled in pleasant shivers. “You sure you can’t come early? There’s got to be room enough on the helicopter for one more.”

*Tempting, Mr. Dekker, very tempting.*

I took his face in my hands to kiss him and savored how my brain fuzzed with happy static at the sensation. “I’ll be there once everything is set here. We still have to lay groundwork for the new perimeter wall and a food storage bunker. Then there’s taking measurements for the cabins, a watchtower and—hey!”

He lifted me from the ground to settle us both down amongst the tangled sheets of our bunk with mischievous gleam in his sky-blue eyes. I had barely a second to think before his lips were on mine again, a delicious warmth in my core that by now was a familiar and welcome feeling.

“You’re. . . you’re going to be late.” I gasped as he made his way down the soft skin of my neck, our hands in a blind race to undo belts and shirt buttons.

“A president is allowed to be late.” Chris whispered in my ear and cupped a hand behind my hip to keep me tight against his body. We were both still sore with bruises from the battle for the Western Pass, but time had helped to soothe most of the worst injuries. My ankle still hurt, and it would take longer to heal than I wanted, but I didn’t need to put much stress on it for this. Clearly my husband didn’t mind his new scars enough to care either.

Running my hands over the raised bits of skin that crisscrossed his muscled chest, I gave him a playful nibble on the shoulder, conscious to avoid where sutures held fresh wounds together. “You could tear those stiches.”

His energy only heightened by my teasing, Chris discarded the last bit of fabric that kept him at bay to pull the blankets over us in a soft cocoon of linen and wool. “If you want me to stop . . .”

*Don’t you dare.*

Unable to muster any words for the way his skin felt on mine, I laced my arms around his neck and happily gave up trying to dissuade him.

Twenty minutes later, we lay side-by-side in the thoroughly rumpled bed, his suit laid out in various discarded pieces on the nearby chair, my own nightshirt lost somewhere in the blankets. Thankfully, all bandages and sutures held, the stiffness in some of my wounds fading to a drowsy contentment. Chris tucked a thick fur coverlet over us, and I rested my tangled head against his chest, shutting my eyes to bask in the moment.

*Practice certainly makes perfect.*

“I still wish we could go together.” He stroked my hair, and Chris stared up at the tent ceiling with a grim line across his lips.

Spreading my fingers across his chest, I watched the short dark hairs flatten under my palm and chewed on my lower lip in thought. As the new president of the Free American Republic, Chris had many challenges on his hands. His first order of business had been to draft and sign into effect an official Constitution for our fledgling nation, one built off the principles of the original we’d grown up with in the U.S. With the Bill of Rights restored, curfews lifted, and market reforms implemented, Chris’s popularity soared amongst the surviving population. Many local businesses reopened, the streets were cleaned of rubble, and food shortages began to wane. A joint effort between the withdrawing ELSAR forces and our own soldiers had seen the power grid restored across Black Oak, and we managed to get the water mains back online. Sewage no longer flowed in the streets, and the number of disease patients in the hospital began to go down.

Still, our greatest accomplishment was, without a doubt, the new Constitution, and I myself had been among the delegates to sign the document. It had been one of the proudest days of my life to stand beside my husband as our dream became a reality, to see Chris’s eyes twinkle with hope for the future, and to walk out onto the courthouse lawn with him to greet the cheering crowds. We’d run up our new flag, red and white striped like the old one, but with a white pine tree in the blue square instead of fifty stars, and someone had even found a stash of old fireworks to shoot off in celebration.

However, like all things, it was not a bloodless victory. With the relaxing of political suppression, the new two-house Assembly had formed ideological blocs that began to look eerily like political parties. Our own Reformists, led by Chris, made up roughly 2/3 of the total government, but a rival group of former collaborators known as the Provincials proved to be a thorn in our side. They refused to sign the new Constitution until Chris promised amnesty to most former Auxiliaries in return for a guarantee of Provincial support in reconstruction. This had in turn enraged many of the former resistance members, who splintered into other factions; most went to the Independents, but sadly a large number defected to the United Liberation Front.

Formed by Josh and his insurgent comrades, the ULF demanded the total removal of all former collaborator families from Barron County by force, the execution of all Auxiliaries and Organ members, and the handing of military authority in Black Oak to ULF forces. All efforts to negotiate with them failed, and when the Assembly refused to allow them representation in both House and Senate due to their aggressive tactics, the ULF denounced our government as illegitimate. They carried out three separate car bomb attacks on our security units in Black Oak and tried to vandalize warehouse where our aid was stored in order to prevent it from reaching the poorer districts. Chris had officially declared them a terrorist organization which meant that, in a strange twist of fate, our troops ended up patrolling alongside the last of the ELSAR soldiers before the latter’s withdrawal to keep the bloodshed at a minimum. While there were multiple ULF attacks to investigate, my scouts reported having trouble with an unidentified sniper who harassed our police units without end, and I dreaded the day I would look down my rifle sights to find Lucille staring back at me. We had won the war, but it seemed true peace would continue to elude us for quite some time.

Still, not all was dark in the road ahead. As the Secretary of Human Welfare for Chris’s cabinet, Sandra Abernathy worked night and day to restore medical services within the town and acted as an envoy to the most impoverished districts in order to gain their support for further reforms. Ethan Sanderson won over the working class with ease, mediating between them and local business owners for pay, benefits, and improved conditions, thus avoiding multiple strikes. He’d wanted to go back to being a simple mechanic, but Chris eventually convinced him to accept the role of Vice President, for which Ethan turned out to be well suited. Black Oak University had been renamed the Carheim Institute, and with a book donation campaign from surviving residents, the old library was brought back to its former glory. I had a painting of Professor Carheim done by one of his former apprentices from the underground, and it hung just inside the entrance along with an inscription in old Latin that read, ‘Those who reach for the light of truth have no need to fear the darkest of lies.’

The real surprise came when one of the newspapers, a Provincial-friendly one no less, ran a story about our soldiers protecting civilians from reprisals during the siege of Black Oak.

In a shock to me, one of the interviewees happened to mention my name, and somehow a picture of me running down the street during the northern district massacre appeared in one of the local magazines, likely taken from a refugee that had been hidden in the bombed-out houses. Just like that, I went from a secondary figure in the new government to a pseudo-celebrity, and my face appeared on pro-reconstruction posters all over the city. Stylists copied the golden streaks in my hair for dozens of girls, tattoo artists ran out of silver ink due to sheer demand, and it got to where I was more worried about being mobbed by fans than attacked by insurgents every time I went anywhere. I found that I hated being so famous, unable to move about in town without an armed escort, but it did come in handy with the one project other I led inside the walls of Black Oak.

At the center of town, in the same square so many had been killed during the fighting, I had a temporary wooden pillar erected in place of a stone one that would replace it in future, once our quarries were operational. Onto this pillar, I carved the names of all the recovered coalition dog tags and captured ELSAR ID cards I had, along with every single name in Kaba’s little black book. He was given the place of honor at the top, *Adrit Veer Kabanagarajan*, along with *Andrea Louise Campbell,* and *Sean Fredrick Hammond*. Without any records as to his real name, I put *Tex* there as well, knowing he wouldn’t have wanted much spotlight anyway. I invited everyone from all sides in the Assembly to the opening ceremony and gave them the chance to write down the name of a loved one they would like to see etched onto the pillar. It didn’t matter who they were, which side they were on, or why they had died; the pillar was for everyone, for all the lost souls who hadn’t lived through the nightmare we’d barely survived. I called it Remembrance Square, and never a day went by that there wasn’t some kind of wreath, bouquet, or candle left at its base by a grieving family. It wasn’t much, but as Chris assured me, it was the first in a long series of steps towards healing.

“I’ll be there before dark.” I curled one leg around him and clung to Chris’s torso with both arms to soak in the heat radiating off his chiseled frame. “Once I know New Wilderness is secure for the night, I’ll come find you. I promise.”

He planted a tender kiss on my forehead. “I’ll hold you to that. First Ladies need to keep their promises. Besides, once the new road is paved, we can move the presidential residence out here and avoid the traffic altogether.”

That drew a smile from me, both in the thought of living closer to the reserve, and at the idea that our cozy little farm wasn’t so far in the future. “Not sold on being an urbanite, huh?”

“My grandfather had it right.” Chris rubbed my shoulder and stared upward through the green canvas ceiling in thought. “A sturdy house, a good piece of land, and a beautiful family is more than enough in this life. Once my term is up, I figure if you won’t mind helping me build the house, I can get us the land, and then maybe we can work on that last part some more.”

*I think we’re well past ‘maybe’, Mr. Dekker.*

My face heated up, and I kept both eyes on his satin-steel chest to avoid giving my giddy smile away. “I’d like that.”

We lay there for another few minutes, before my battered alarm clock rang to inform us that he was, in fact, late. Together we rose to repeat the dressing process, and I shrugged on my new uniform, eyeing the golden stars on the collar in the nearby mirror.

With the war over, and the bulk of the coalition army disbanded, those who didn’t want a place in the budding government went their separate ways. Adam and Eve returned with the remainder of their brethren to Ark River, where Eve made sure her recovering husband got his rest, whether Adam felt he needed it or not. Their patrols continued to round up Puppets in order to redeem them via sunlight, though multiple Arkian women discovered they were pregnant shortly after the Breach’s collapse, and fresh marriages continued in their enclave by the day. Many of the original population of Barron County stayed in Ark River, while others traveled west to join the growing flock of people looking to reconquer the gated community near Sunbright. Some moved to Black Oak, but a few dared to venture out into the wild, with hopes of building their own fortified blockhouses, miniature settlements, or farming strongholds in the vast unclaimed lands of the countryside. Untainted by the continuous influence of the Breach, the landscape stabilized, and the tide of mutants slowed. Now it was time for mankind to do what we did best; regroup, rearm, and take back our home.

“Morning, Mr. President; the transport flight is ready at the landing pad, awaiting your orders.” As we emerged from the military surplus tent, a green-uniformed ranger came up and saluted us both. “Commander Dekker, we’ve got a supply convoy that just came in, and the captain asked where you wanted the radios to go?”

It took a moment for me to remember that he was addressing *me*, and I nodded toward the line of vehicles parked on the other side of the ridge, where bulldozers rumbled back and forth to smooth out the shell craters. “Talk to Head Ranger McPhearson. Tell him I’ll be helping with the wall construction detail this afternoon, before my flight to the capitol this evening. He’ll be briefed before I leave.”

“Yes, commander.” The boy saluted again and took off at a run.

I turned to find Chris watching me with a toothy smile. “What?”

He shook his head and slipped one hand into mine as we walked. “I do *not* miss my old post.”

“And I do *not* envy your current one.” Leaning on him to keep the weight off my sore ankle, I strode with Chris down the newly bladed road between the tents, snowflakes tumbling around us. Our medics had provided me with a cane to use until the wound healed, but while I carried it even now, I hated using the thing. It made me feel old, and I couldn’t wait until I didn’t need the creaking stick anymore. “Those Assembly sessions drive me crazy. I don’t know how you get through them without wanting to shoot someone.”

“Trust me, it’s crossed my mind.” Chris’s face dimmed somewhat, and he let out a long sigh. “But I think once enough time passes, the old problems will sort themselves out. Our first civil war didn’t end us, and we had a lot more to deal with this time around.”

Pacing through the camp, we looked on in mute thought at the fervent construction that bustled all around us. Crews worked tirelessly to operate heavy equipment, lay gravel, and haul logs to their various positions. Unlike the old New Wilderness, this one would be larger, encompassing the entire hill the reserve originally sat on, with rings of palisade walls guarding it from base to crest. Once the spring came, we planned to pour cement foundations and bring in large stone blocks from the local quarry, replacing the wooden fort with a stone castle that would outlast us all. It would serve both as a conservation center for the animal species that roamed our newborn republic, and as a command post for our peacetime military, of which I was now chief officer. Some of the structures being rebuilt were given their old names: Carnivore Cove, the Fur and Fang Veterinary Center, the Herbivore Barns. It was with a strange combination of melancholy and closure that I observed the workers raise framed walls on the central barracks, which bore the name “Elk Lodge.” In truth, it would be closer to a medieval keep by the time it was done properly in stone next spring. Part of me would always miss the old rustic lodge, where Chris and I shared our first dance, our first kiss, and our first clumsy attempt at a dinner date. It would never truly be the same . . . but then again, none of this would be. We were about to pass into a different world, a different time, and everything was once again going to change.

Reaching the helicopter pad, a flattened part of the small ridge where a Blackhawk waited, Chris stopped to adjust his tie in the way he always did before going into another heated Assembly meeting. “I’ll see you tonight, then?”

My heart skipped a fluttery beat, and I took the lapels of his suit in my hands to kiss the boy who dug me out of the moldy pile of shoes all those nights ago. “I guarantee it.”

Chris rested his forehead against mine and bore into my eyes with his. “I love you, *pragtige*.”

“And I love you, *aantreklik*.” I held him tight, satisfied at the way my rough attempt at Afrikaans made him smile. “Be safe.”

A part of my heart twinged as the helicopter whirred off to the north, but I hefted the rifle on my shoulder and made for the front gate. There, a small caravan waited for me, made up of riders on horses, bicycles, motorcycles, and a few wagons drawn by oxen. Every saddlebag bulged with supplies, the wagons piled high with everything the group might need. Tools, provisions, water, medicine, no expense had been spared. Such extravagances would be unheard of tomorrow, the first day Barron County would wake up in a new reality, cut off from ELSAR’s mandated contributions.

*But it’s not tomorrow yet.*

At my approach, a rather conspicuous figure jumped down from the lead wagon to make a sweeping bow.

“Didn’t expect you to be up, commander. Thought you decided to take the morning off.” Even with his broad hat in one hand, head bent in dramatic flair, I could still see the wry grin on Peter’s face. “Though by the look of the president’s suit, you almost did, eh?”

“Something like that.” I chuckled as he righted himself and eyed the pirate’s revitalized getup. “I like the hat.”

Peter again wore the long-tailed coat, knee-high boots, and gleaming silver rapier of a 17^(th) century buccaneer, adding a tricorn hat that someone found atop his bandana-wrapped head. A single feather poked from its silken band, and with the dark stubble lining his thin face, Peter certainly looked roguish enough to appear in a movie set somewhere. One piece of his kit was not for mere appearances, however. Over his left eye, Peter now sported a black eyepatch, the long red scar extended from either side denoting where Grapeshot’s cutlass had made its mark. Our medics tended to it the best they could, but Peter knew as well as they did that he would never see with his left eye again. Still, it hadn’t dampened his spirits.

If anything, it made him more of a rascal than ever.

Behind him, the last of those who were going south lounged on their various mounts, talking or sipping on hot coffee provided by the camp mess. In a shrewd political maneuver, Chris used the Provincials’ amnesty demand for the Organs as a loophole to waive the life sentence for Peter and his crew. Officially free men, they were granted letters of marque as privateers of the F.A.R Naval Forces. Granted, they were the *only* naval force we had, but Peter had accepted the task before the Assembly with great charm, stirring more than one adoring newspaper article written by swooning girls. Set to return to the *Harper’s Vengeance*, they would patrol the Sea of Sargosia (formerly Maple Lake) on behalf of our government, ferrying settlers to abandoned farm sites or protecting researchers while they studied mutant migrations. As well, they would aid in keeping any form of banditry off our waters, especially since a large portion of ex-Organ members had elected to leave Black Oak and move into the countryside for fear of the ULF. Many orphans volunteered to join him when Peter opened a recruitment line in the local pub, and they all looked forward to a new life on our growing inland sea.

One face in particular stuck out of the caravan, and I limped over to crane my neck at the silent figure atop the lead wagon’s seat. “Hey, you. All ready to go?”

Tarren didn’t say anything, but nodded, twisted a few thin strands of vine in her fingers to form knots. She hadn’t very much spoken since the Breach, and never smiled, a quiet shadow of the girl I’d met in the hold of the *Harper’s Vengeance.* It hurt to see, and I knew Peter was most affected by it, though he tried not to let the pain show. Of anyone, Tarren was least deserving of what she had endured, but the war had shown no favoritism to anyone.

*Curse Vecitorak and his filthy rotten soul.*

I rested my elbows on the wagon’s side and made a conspiratorial whisper in a bid to cheer her up. “I heard they’ve got an ice cream shop set to open in Black Oak. I’ll bring some with me when I come to visit, and we can eat crunchy cones together. Maybe after, you can take a trip here and pet a mammoth. They’re like elephants, but fuzzier. Sound good?”

The girl chewed her lower lip, but bobbed her head in agreement, and continued to tie knots in silence.

“Okay.” Somewhat disappointed, I turned to go, but to my surprise, a little jerk on my sleeve halted my steps.

Tarren held her arms out for a hug, and I didn’t deny her.

“I don’t sleep good.” Her whisper in my ear broke my heart, raspy from disuse and fatigue.

*I know the feeling.*

Rubbing her back, I held her tight, and felt a sympathetic wince cross my face. “Nightmares?”

She nodded, skinny fingers gripping my uniform epaulets like they were lifelines.

“I have them too.” I kissed her hair and wished I could keep the little thing with me, though I knew she was better off with her crew . . . her family. “But you want to know a secret?”

Tarren looked at me with watery eyes, on the edge of tears that she’d likely shed a thousand times already. Few could know what she’d been through, the feeling of the roots burrowing inside her skin the pain, the whispers in her mind. I had been fortunate never to fully succumb to the infection, but she had spent hours, days, weeks in the clutches of the Oak Walker’s growth. Still, I knew how it felt, and in that way, we were closer than sisters, bonded in memories too horrible to forget. I wouldn’t let her trod that path alone.

Leaning close, I produced a little wooden pendant I’d carved from a chunk of pine, crude and angular, but sanded smooth enough to prevent splinters. It was a lantern, a tiny wooden lantern with the inside of the vault painted with gold to stand in for a flame. While I didn’t get much down time, there were moments of darkness for me too, nights when I woke up in a cold sweat, or brief instants of panic that hit me out of nowhere in random places. Thanks to helping Chris with a new batch of miniatures for his Christmas outreach program, carving had become my nervous tick in those times, and I didn’t know why, but my mind always went back to that golden lantern, shining in the night. Like the one I’d seen in a different place, held by different hands, perhaps this too would help guide Tarren home.

“Whenever you can’t sleep.” I handed her the pendant and closed her little fingers over it. “Light a candle and hold this tight as you can. When you do, I want you to say one thing to yourself, out loud, until you feel better again.”

Her face contorted in a mix of hope and confusion, Tarren waiting for the necessary words that must have sounded like a magic recipe to her young mind.

Seeing a pair of gentle silver irises in my mind, I rubbed one thumb over the little girl’s cheek to wipe the tears away. “*You have no idea how loved you are*.”

I had to her repeat it back to me until Tarren could say it without stumbling over the words. She thanked me with another hug, and it took a superhuman force of willpower just to walk away. However, when I looked back over my shoulder, Tarren was peering at the lantern in her hands, lips moving with the silent mantra, eyes filled with something like hope.

*He can hear you, Tarren. He’s right there. Just look closer.*

As we walked to the front of the lineup, Peter glanced at me out of the corner of his one good eye. “You sure ya don’t need us to stick around for a few more days? Me and the lads don’t mind the heavy liftin.”

“The snow’s going to get deeper the longer we wait.” I thumped along with my cane, a bittersweet frown on my face as we stopped next to the poles that would soon become our main gate. “I’m sure the *Harper’s Vengeance* will need repairs before she can put to sea again, and the roads from here to there won’t be easy. Chris and I will come visit as soon as we can.”

“I’ll have to build a spare room in the fort then.” Peter rested his hand on the hilt of Grace’s rapier, the ornate sword hanging from his hip, and I noted how calm he seemed. The old weariness, torment, and sadness were long gone, and Peter gobbled up the morning sunshine with hungry eyes. He was ready, ready for a fresh start, a new life.

*Hopefully a long and happy one.*

“You know, I never did ask.” Staring out alongside him onto the white, snow-covered hills around us, I rested both hands on my cane for support. “You last name . . . what is it?”

“Nelson.” He smirked, and Peter made a modest shrug. “Peter G. Nelson. Honestly never had much use for it, ‘specially once I turned pirate; imagine a pirate named Nelson.”

“Maybe not a pirate.” I raised one eyebrow and recalled something Chris had told me once during our early dates at New Wilderness. “But there was a famous admiral by that name. Even had a statue of him put up in Britain somewhere.”

“Ya don’t say?” Peter’s good eye twinkled in wonder. “Well, I suppose I’ll have to read up on that, if we ever find more books. The crew could use some new stories . . . who knows, maybe I’ll try and write one for them.”

“I look forward to reading a copy.” At my wave, the rest of his caravan mounted up, and I met Peter’s eye one last time. “Fair sailing to you, Captain Nelson.”

Mounting his own horse at the front of the wagons, Peter tipped his hat with a cavalier grin and tossed one of my uniform collar pins to me that I hadn’t realized was missing. “Until next time, Commander Dekker.”

Alone, I trudged back through the camp to a quiet spot on the eastern edge of the hilltop. Here a small cherry tree had survived the ELSAR barrage that destroyed the rest of its brethren in the artisanal grove, and with most people a fair distance off, I sat down on a large stone dumped by our earth-moving crew.

Placing my rifle to one side, I slid the camera strap off my shoulder and set up a small tripod one of the mechanics fashioned for me. I popped in the last SD card I had, two plastic containers full of them in my camera case and positioned the lens to face me.

My thumb hit *record,* and I sat back on the stone to clear my throat. “So, um . . . this is going to be my last video. I want to state for the record that I am not suicidal, this is not a death note, and I am in good health. This is . . . well, this is me saying goodbye.”

A hard wave of emotion hit me at that word, and I had to blink back the mixed feelings as I thought of what I was doing.

*Focus, Hannah. This is important. You can do this, you have to.*

“Everything you need to know should be recorded in the memory cards.” Staring at the tiny image of myself in the side screen, I looked back into the dark lens, holding up a stack of papers, notebooks, and files. “Along with a complete roster of the accounts collected by Professor Carheim. I also had one of the girls at the university transcribe my recordings on one of the computers we got shipped in during ELSAR’s last aid convoy, so everything is in paper form too. There should be two sets of each in the box.”

Cold wind blew a light dusting of snowflakes over my shoulder, and I watched them dance across the scene before me. They were beautiful, clean and white, as if washing away the scars of the old world. Somehow, they made me feel stronger, and I pushed myself onward.

“If you’re watching this, then you know what to do.” I nodded at the camera, as if I were speaking directly to the person I would entrust the dossier to. “The memory cards I will go to my parents, Allen and Margerie Brun, along with one of the transcript copies. As agreed, you keep one of the paper copies of everything, and you can post or publish them however you see fit, just so long as the truth is told. I’m counting on you, so . . . please, don’t let me down.”

One of the Smugglers from the old resistance, a man who had distinguished himself in the war, had sworn he could slip across the border before the Breach took us. Due to our agreement with ELSAR, we had forbidden such things, but I secretly agreed to let this man go, if he did me one very special favor. I had remembered a contact on the other side, an old acquaintance that knew me from a summer job in my high school days, and one I was confident would be trustworthy. In return for getting both packages to this special contact, the Smuggler and his family would be escorted to the border and snuck through the ELSAR checkpoints to freedom. Then, my old coworker would hopefully do as I asked and send one of the packets to my parents, before posting everything he’d been given online. By the time ELSAR reacted, it would be too late, and the world would know the truth. Most would laugh it off, many dismiss it as mere fiction, but some would believe, and that was enough. Koranti wouldn’t be able to hide forever, and mankind would have a chance, if a slim one, to fight back. It was a risky gamble, but I’d made worse decisions than that before.

*We’ll be ancient history by tomorrow anyway.*

Looking at my hands, I drew a deep, shuddery breath, and tried not to envision how much blood they had shed. “Now, I want to speak directly to my mom and dad.”

My heart beat a thousand miles a minute, as if they would step out from behind the camera to surprise me, but I straightened up and thought of their loving faces. “If you’ve watched the other videos, or read the transcript, then you’ve heard my story up to now. As much as it seems like some crazy hoax, as much as you’ll want to believe it’s all fake, please, trust what I’ve told you. I am alive, and I’m safe.”

A tear managed to crest my left eyelid, but I brushed it away stubbornly. “I wish you could have met Chris. I know you would have liked him, Dad. He would have been so nervous to meet you, but I think you would have gotten along. He’s good to me, kind, gentle. He reminds me of you, sometimes.”

Still the feelings rose in my throat, tried to choke me, and I fought not to sob. “Mom, I . . . I miss you. There’s a video from our wedding in one of the SD cards, I guess someone had a working camera and thought to record it all. I know we didn’t always get along, but I hope I made you proud. I wouldn’t be who I am if it weren’t for you. I know we’ll see each other again someday, even if not the way you’d want.”

Pain, old and familiar at this point, grew in my chest, a coarse sensation that wanted to stifle me. I couldn’t let it. This was too important. I had to carry on, to finish this.

They had to be told.

*Give me strength, Adonai.*

“I love you both, more than you could ever know.” I squeezed my eyes shut, and my voice cracked as hot salty waves rolled down my cheeks. “I always will. That’s why I wanted to make this recording just for you, because you deserve to know something.”

Across my face came a smile, a real smile, one that burst with the secret whispered to me in the sunlit meadows of Tauerpin Road. “You’re going to be grandparents. I know, it should be too soon to tell, but let’s just say I have it on good authority. I haven’t told Chris yet, I want to surprise him. If it’s a boy, I’d like to name him Rodrick, after Chris’s grandfather. If it’s a girl . . .”

The breeze rustled my hair, sending strands of brown and gold twirling before my eyes. Despite the winter chill, it almost seemed warm, as if from a distant summer memory, and I glanced down at the rifle by my side. While heavier than my old Type 9, the Kalashnikov gleamed under a thin coat of oil, scuffed and scratched, but reliable. Across the ground in front of me, dozens upon dozens of picture frames stood amongst the snow, staked into the ground under the cherry tree with a multitude of smiling faces. They had been copied at the university by one of the few remaining printers, encased in laminate to guard against the weather. Names were painted on the frames under each, and the one closest to me bore a man and a girl with similar facial features. Their bleach-blonde hair played in the sunlight, their uniform shirts boasting ‘New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve’ on the pocket, and tucked into the frame alongside it, was our picture.

*Man, that cake was good, wasn’t it? I never danced so much in my whole life. The dress you got me was so beautiful too . . .*

Laughing as I wept, I let grief mingle with joy until both melded into a torrent of feeling, not painful so much as grateful. Perhaps someday I would grow old so that the places, times, and dates faded into obscurity, but a part of me knew I could never forget the ones who guided me here.

Here, where I was always meant to be.

“If it’s a girl . . .” Resting my gaze on the camera, I let the wind whisper in my ear, the sun warm on my face, and breathed deep the air of my country as it caressed the cherry tree. “. . . I’m going to call her Jamie.”",3,1760621762.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1o86b08,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o86b08,How can I improve my brewing? (video in desc.),"[https://imgur.com/a/V0ukrm5](https://imgur.com/a/V0ukrm5)

Hi there good people!  
I recently brewed a cup using my 3 cup Moka Express and wanted to ask for your feedback on how to make it better. I uploaded the video of the extraction to the link above, I liked the photos better so I wanted to upload them here 😄

Here’s what I did this time:  
I used El Salvador single origin pre-grounded coffee. It roasted on September 5th and ground on September 25th. Also this batch was slightly finer than what I normally use. I used hot water because someone said hot water is better for fine grounded beans, i think it's around 75°C because I waited a time. You can see the levels of coffee and water in the pictures. Started brewing at slightly above the lowest heat setting (you can think of it as 0.5 higher than the lowest)

After brewing, I diluted it with roughly an equal amount of hot water before drinking.

Result:  
The brew had kinda pleasant aroma and smooth enough, rounded body and not too heavy. According to the roaster, the tasting notes should be honey, dark chocolate, and apple but honestly I couldn’t really pick up any of those flavors. Maybe I under-extracted or slightly overheated it. The taste leaned mildly bitter but still balanced and enjoyable overall. Well, I'm bad at describing the aromas 😆 There is also some water left in the lower chamber, you can see it in the last photo.

For context, the previous cup I brewed just a few minutes earlier came out a bit burnt and harsh, so this time I decided to dilute it with water out of caution. That might’ve also softened the flavor and masked some notes.

Thanks in advance for any tips! ☕",5,1760621680.0,mokapot,2,1.0,False

Chris sighed and shook his head at the mirror. “I look like a penguin.”

In the quiet confines of our tent, he stood before a cracked mirror we’d scrounged from an abandoned house, while the woodstove in the corner crackled merrily on its embers. It wasn’t much of a shelter, but it kept the cold away and we never had snow fall on us, so that was a plus. There was enough room for our crude bed, a simple bunk knocked together from scrap lumber bearing a mattress stuffed full of old rags. Our floor had been fashioned out of wooden pallets to hold everything off the frozen mud, and a rectangular pine chest contained most of our meager belongings. During the day, our homemade wood stove put out enough heat to keep the tent fairly warm, while at night it struggled to keep ice from forming on the tent poles. We were fortunate, I knew; there were still so many out there that had nothing, despite how hard our forces worked to put more old houses bac in working order. Chris wanted to wait until he was sure most of the general populace had somewhere to go before he arranged for our own home, and I’d grown used to sleeping under several blankets. With him by my side every night, snuggled by the glow of a fire, it wasn’t so bad.

*Though I won’t mind once we have a real door that can lock. And a fireplace. And a toilet.*

With gentle hands I straightened his tie, taking in the way the suit fit him like a glove. “No, you look *handsome.* It fits you. Very distinguished.”

“So, a very distinguished penguin then.” He let slide an ornery grin and pulled me to him, both calloused hands on my waist so that my spine tingled in pleasant shivers. “You sure you can’t come early? There’s got to be room enough on the helicopter for one more.”

*Tempting, Mr. Dekker, very tempting.*

I took his face in my hands to kiss him and savored how my brain fuzzed with happy static at the sensation. “I’ll be there once everything is set here. We still have to lay groundwork for the new perimeter wall and a food storage bunker. Then there’s taking measurements for the cabins, a watchtower and—hey!”

He lifted me from the ground to settle us both down amongst the tangled sheets of our bunk with mischievous gleam in his sky-blue eyes. I had barely a second to think before his lips were on mine again, a delicious warmth in my core that by now was a familiar and welcome feeling.

“You’re. . . you’re going to be late.” I gasped as he made his way down the soft skin of my neck, our hands in a blind race to undo belts and shirt buttons.

“A president is allowed to be late.” Chris whispered in my ear and cupped a hand behind my hip to keep me tight against his body. We were both still sore with bruises from the battle for the Western Pass, but time had helped to soothe most of the worst injuries. My ankle still hurt, and it would take longer to heal than I wanted, but I didn’t need to put much stress on it for this. Clearly my husband didn’t mind his new scars enough to care either.

Running my hands over the raised bits of skin that crisscrossed his muscled chest, I gave him a playful nibble on the shoulder, conscious to avoid where sutures held fresh wounds together. “You could tear those stiches.”

His energy only heightened by my teasing, Chris discarded the last bit of fabric that kept him at bay to pull the blankets over us in a soft cocoon of linen and wool. “If you want me to stop . . .”

*Don’t you dare.*

Unable to muster any words for the way his skin felt on mine, I laced my arms around his neck and happily gave up trying to dissuade him.

Twenty minutes later, we lay side-by-side in the thoroughly rumpled bed, his suit laid out in various discarded pieces on the nearby chair, my own nightshirt lost somewhere in the blankets. Thankfully, all bandages and sutures held, the stiffness in some of my wounds fading to a drowsy contentment. Chris tucked a thick fur coverlet over us, and I rested my tangled head against his chest, shutting my eyes to bask in the moment.

*Practice certainly makes perfect.*

“I still wish we could go together.” He stroked my hair, and Chris stared up at the tent ceiling with a grim line across his lips.

Spreading my fingers across his chest, I watched the short dark hairs flatten under my palm and chewed on my lower lip in thought. As the new president of the Free American Republic, Chris had many challenges on his hands. His first order of business had been to draft and sign into effect an official Constitution for our fledgling nation, one built off the principles of the original we’d grown up with in the U.S. With the Bill of Rights restored, curfews lifted, and market reforms implemented, Chris’s popularity soared amongst the surviving population. Many local businesses reopened, the streets were cleaned of rubble, and food shortages began to wane. A joint effort between the withdrawing ELSAR forces and our own soldiers had seen the power grid restored across Black Oak, and we managed to get the water mains back online. Sewage no longer flowed in the streets, and the number of disease patients in the hospital began to go down.

Still, our greatest accomplishment was, without a doubt, the new Constitution, and I myself had been among the delegates to sign the document. It had been one of the proudest days of my life to stand beside my husband as our dream became a reality, to see Chris’s eyes twinkle with hope for the future, and to walk out onto the courthouse lawn with him to greet the cheering crowds. We’d run up our new flag, red and white striped like the old one, but with a white pine tree in the blue square instead of fifty stars, and someone had even found a stash of old fireworks to shoot off in celebration.

However, like all things, it was not a bloodless victory. With the relaxing of political suppression, the new two-house Assembly had formed ideological blocs that began to look eerily like political parties. Our own Reformists, led by Chris, made up roughly 2/3 of the total government, but a rival group of former collaborators known as the Provincials proved to be a thorn in our side. They refused to sign the new Constitution until Chris promised amnesty to most former Auxiliaries in return for a guarantee of Provincial support in reconstruction. This had in turn enraged many of the former resistance members, who splintered into other factions; most went to the Independents, but sadly a large number defected to the United Liberation Front.

Formed by Josh and his insurgent comrades, the ULF demanded the total removal of all former collaborator families from Barron County by force, the execution of all Auxiliaries and Organ members, and the handing of military authority in Black Oak to ULF forces. All efforts to negotiate with them failed, and when the Assembly refused to allow them representation in both House and Senate due to their aggressive tactics, the ULF denounced our government as illegitimate. They carried out three separate car bomb attacks on our security units in Black Oak and tried to vandalize warehouse where our aid was stored in order to prevent it from reaching the poorer districts. Chris had officially declared them a terrorist organization which meant that, in a strange twist of fate, our troops ended up patrolling alongside the last of the ELSAR soldiers before the latter’s withdrawal to keep the bloodshed at a minimum. While there were multiple ULF attacks to investigate, my scouts reported having trouble with an unidentified sniper who harassed our police units without end, and I dreaded the day I would look down my rifle sights to find Lucille staring back at me. We had won the war, but it seemed true peace would continue to elude us for quite some time.

Still, not all was dark in the road ahead. As the Secretary of Human Welfare for Chris’s cabinet, Sandra Abernathy worked night and day to restore medical services within the town and acted as an envoy to the most impoverished districts in order to gain their support for further reforms. Ethan Sanderson won over the working class with ease, mediating between them and local business owners for pay, benefits, and improved conditions, thus avoiding multiple strikes. He’d wanted to go back to being a simple mechanic, but Chris eventually convinced him to accept the role of Vice President, for which Ethan turned out to be well suited. Black Oak University had been renamed the Carheim Institute, and with a book donation campaign from surviving residents, the old library was brought back to its former glory. I had a painting of Professor Carheim done by one of his former apprentices from the underground, and it hung just inside the entrance along with an inscription in old Latin that read, ‘Those who reach for the light of truth have no need to fear the darkest of lies.’

The real surprise came when one of the newspapers, a Provincial-friendly one no less, ran a story about our soldiers protecting civilians from reprisals during the siege of Black Oak.

In a shock to me, one of the interviewees happened to mention my name, and somehow a picture of me running down the street during the northern district massacre appeared in one of the local magazines, likely taken from a refugee that had been hidden in the bombed-out houses. Just like that, I went from a secondary figure in the new government to a pseudo-celebrity, and my face appeared on pro-reconstruction posters all over the city. Stylists copied the golden streaks in my hair for dozens of girls, tattoo artists ran out of silver ink due to sheer demand, and it got to where I was more worried about being mobbed by fans than attacked by insurgents every time I went anywhere. I found that I hated being so famous, unable to move about in town without an armed escort, but it did come in handy with the one project other I led inside the walls of Black Oak.

At the center of town, in the same square so many had been killed during the fighting, I had a temporary wooden pillar erected in place of a stone one that would replace it in future, once our quarries were operational. Onto this pillar, I carved the names of all the recovered coalition dog tags and captured ELSAR ID cards I had, along with every single name in Kaba’s little black book. He was given the place of honor at the top, *Adrit Veer Kabanagarajan*, along with *Andrea Louise Campbell,* and *Sean Fredrick Hammond*. Without any records as to his real name, I put *Tex* there as well, knowing he wouldn’t have wanted much spotlight anyway. I invited everyone from all sides in the Assembly to the opening ceremony and gave them the chance to write down the name of a loved one they would like to see etched onto the pillar. It didn’t matter who they were, which side they were on, or why they had died; the pillar was for everyone, for all the lost souls who hadn’t lived through the nightmare we’d barely survived. I called it Remembrance Square, and never a day went by that there wasn’t some kind of wreath, bouquet, or candle left at its base by a grieving family. It wasn’t much, but as Chris assured me, it was the first in a long series of steps towards healing.

“I’ll be there before dark.” I curled one leg around him and clung to Chris’s torso with both arms to soak in the heat radiating off his chiseled frame. “Once I know New Wilderness is secure for the night, I’ll come find you. I promise.”

He planted a tender kiss on my forehead. “I’ll hold you to that. First Ladies need to keep their promises. Besides, once the new road is paved, we can move the presidential residence out here and avoid the traffic altogether.”

That drew a smile from me, both in the thought of living closer to the reserve, and at the idea that our cozy little farm wasn’t so far in the future. “Not sold on being an urbanite, huh?”

“My grandfather had it right.” Chris rubbed my shoulder and stared upward through the green canvas ceiling in thought. “A sturdy house, a good piece of land, and a beautiful family is more than enough in this life. Once my term is up, I figure if you won’t mind helping me build the house, I can get us the land, and then maybe we can work on that last part some more.”

*I think we’re well past ‘maybe’, Mr. Dekker.*

My face heated up, and I kept both eyes on his satin-steel chest to avoid giving my giddy smile away. “I’d like that.”

We lay there for another few minutes, before my battered alarm clock rang to inform us that he was, in fact, late. Together we rose to repeat the dressing process, and I shrugged on my new uniform, eyeing the golden stars on the collar in the nearby mirror.

With the war over, and the bulk of the coalition army disbanded, those who didn’t want a place in the budding government went their separate ways. Adam and Eve returned with the remainder of their brethren to Ark River, where Eve made sure her recovering husband got his rest, whether Adam felt he needed it or not. Their patrols continued to round up Puppets in order to redeem them via sunlight, though multiple Arkian women discovered they were pregnant shortly after the Breach’s collapse, and fresh marriages continued in their enclave by the day. Many of the original population of Barron County stayed in Ark River, while others traveled west to join the growing flock of people looking to reconquer the gated community near Sunbright. Some moved to Black Oak, but a few dared to venture out into the wild, with hopes of building their own fortified blockhouses, miniature settlements, or farming strongholds in the vast unclaimed lands of the countryside. Untainted by the continuous influence of the Breach, the landscape stabilized, and the tide of mutants slowed. Now it was time for mankind to do what we did best; regroup, rearm, and take back our home.

“Morning, Mr. President; the transport flight is ready at the landing pad, awaiting your orders.” As we emerged from the military surplus tent, a green-uniformed ranger came up and saluted us both. “Commander Dekker, we’ve got a supply convoy that just came in, and the captain asked where you wanted the radios to go?”

It took a moment for me to remember that he was addressing *me*, and I nodded toward the line of vehicles parked on the other side of the ridge, where bulldozers rumbled back and forth to smooth out the shell craters. “Talk to Head Ranger McPhearson. Tell him I’ll be helping with the wall construction detail this afternoon, before my flight to the capitol this evening. He’ll be briefed before I leave.”

“Yes, commander.” The boy saluted again and took off at a run.

I turned to find Chris watching me with a toothy smile. “What?”

He shook his head and slipped one hand into mine as we walked. “I do *not* miss my old post.”

“And I do *not* envy your current one.” Leaning on him to keep the weight off my sore ankle, I strode with Chris down the newly bladed road between the tents, snowflakes tumbling around us. Our medics had provided me with a cane to use until the wound healed, but while I carried it even now, I hated using the thing. It made me feel old, and I couldn’t wait until I didn’t need the creaking stick anymore. “Those Assembly sessions drive me crazy. I don’t know how you get through them without wanting to shoot someone.”

“Trust me, it’s crossed my mind.” Chris’s face dimmed somewhat, and he let out a long sigh. “But I think once enough time passes, the old problems will sort themselves out. Our first civil war didn’t end us, and we had a lot more to deal with this time around.”

Pacing through the camp, we looked on in mute thought at the fervent construction that bustled all around us. Crews worked tirelessly to operate heavy equipment, lay gravel, and haul logs to their various positions. Unlike the old New Wilderness, this one would be larger, encompassing the entire hill the reserve originally sat on, with rings of palisade walls guarding it from base to crest. Once the spring came, we planned to pour cement foundations and bring in large stone blocks from the local quarry, replacing the wooden fort with a stone castle that would outlast us all. It would serve both as a conservation center for the animal species that roamed our newborn republic, and as a command post for our peacetime military, of which I was now chief officer. Some of the structures being rebuilt were given their old names: Carnivore Cove, the Fur and Fang Veterinary Center, the Herbivore Barns. It was with a strange combination of melancholy and closure that I observed the workers raise framed walls on the central barracks, which bore the name “Elk Lodge.” In truth, it would be closer to a medieval keep by the time it was done properly in stone next spring. Part of me would always miss the old rustic lodge, where Chris and I shared our first dance, our first kiss, and our first clumsy attempt at a dinner date. It would never truly be the same . . . but then again, none of this would be. We were about to pass into a different world, a different time, and everything was once again going to change.

Reaching the helicopter pad, a flattened part of the small ridge where a Blackhawk waited, Chris stopped to adjust his tie in the way he always did before going into another heated Assembly meeting. “I’ll see you tonight, then?”

My heart skipped a fluttery beat, and I took the lapels of his suit in my hands to kiss the boy who dug me out of the moldy pile of shoes all those nights ago. “I guarantee it.”

Chris rested his forehead against mine and bore into my eyes with his. “I love you, *pragtige*.”

“And I love you, *aantreklik*.” I held him tight, satisfied at the way my rough attempt at Afrikaans made him smile. “Be safe.”

A part of my heart twinged as the helicopter whirred off to the north, but I hefted the rifle on my shoulder and made for the front gate. There, a small caravan waited for me, made up of riders on horses, bicycles, motorcycles, and a few wagons drawn by oxen. Every saddlebag bulged with supplies, the wagons piled high with everything the group might need. Tools, provisions, water, medicine, no expense had been spared. Such extravagances would be unheard of tomorrow, the first day Barron County would wake up in a new reality, cut off from ELSAR’s mandated contributions.

*But it’s not tomorrow yet.*

At my approach, a rather conspicuous figure jumped down from the lead wagon to make a sweeping bow.

“Didn’t expect you to be up, commander. Thought you decided to take the morning off.” Even with his broad hat in one hand, head bent in dramatic flair, I could still see the wry grin on Peter’s face. “Though by the look of the president’s suit, you almost did, eh?”

“Something like that.” I chuckled as he righted himself and eyed the pirate’s revitalized getup. “I like the hat.”

Peter again wore the long-tailed coat, knee-high boots, and gleaming silver rapier of a 17^(th) century buccaneer, adding a tricorn hat that someone found atop his bandana-wrapped head. A single feather poked from its silken band, and with the dark stubble lining his thin face, Peter certainly looked roguish enough to appear in a movie set somewhere. One piece of his kit was not for mere appearances, however. Over his left eye, Peter now sported a black eyepatch, the long red scar extended from either side denoting where Grapeshot’s cutlass had made its mark. Our medics tended to it the best they could, but Peter knew as well as they did that he would never see with his left eye again. Still, it hadn’t dampened his spirits.

If anything, it made him more of a rascal than ever.

Behind him, the last of those who were going south lounged on their various mounts, talking or sipping on hot coffee provided by the camp mess. In a shrewd political maneuver, Chris used the Provincials’ amnesty demand for the Organs as a loophole to waive the life sentence for Peter and his crew. Officially free men, they were granted letters of marque as privateers of the F.A.R Naval Forces. Granted, they were the *only* naval force we had, but Peter had accepted the task before the Assembly with great charm, stirring more than one adoring newspaper article written by swooning girls. Set to return to the *Harper’s Vengeance*, they would patrol the Sea of Sargosia (formerly Maple Lake) on behalf of our government, ferrying settlers to abandoned farm sites or protecting researchers while they studied mutant migrations. As well, they would aid in keeping any form of banditry off our waters, especially since a large portion of ex-Organ members had elected to leave Black Oak and move into the countryside for fear of the ULF. Many orphans volunteered to join him when Peter opened a recruitment line in the local pub, and they all looked forward to a new life on our growing inland sea.

One face in particular stuck out of the caravan, and I limped over to crane my neck at the silent figure atop the lead wagon’s seat. “Hey, you. All ready to go?”

Tarren didn’t say anything, but nodded, twisted a few thin strands of vine in her fingers to form knots. She hadn’t very much spoken since the Breach, and never smiled, a quiet shadow of the girl I’d met in the hold of the *Harper’s Vengeance.* It hurt to see, and I knew Peter was most affected by it, though he tried not to let the pain show. Of anyone, Tarren was least deserving of what she had endured, but the war had shown no favoritism to anyone.

*Curse Vecitorak and his filthy rotten soul.*

I rested my elbows on the wagon’s side and made a conspiratorial whisper in a bid to cheer her up. “I heard they’ve got an ice cream shop set to open in Black Oak. I’ll bring some with me when I come to visit, and we can eat crunchy cones together. Maybe after, you can take a trip here and pet a mammoth. They’re like elephants, but fuzzier. Sound good?”

The girl chewed her lower lip, but bobbed her head in agreement, and continued to tie knots in silence.

“Okay.” Somewhat disappointed, I turned to go, but to my surprise, a little jerk on my sleeve halted my steps.

Tarren held her arms out for a hug, and I didn’t deny her.

“I don’t sleep good.” Her whisper in my ear broke my heart, raspy from disuse and fatigue.

*I know the feeling.*

Rubbing her back, I held her tight, and felt a sympathetic wince cross my face. “Nightmares?”

She nodded, skinny fingers gripping my uniform epaulets like they were lifelines.

“I have them too.” I kissed her hair and wished I could keep the little thing with me, though I knew she was better off with her crew . . . her family. “But you want to know a secret?”

Tarren looked at me with watery eyes, on the edge of tears that she’d likely shed a thousand times already. Few could know what she’d been through, the feeling of the roots burrowing inside her skin the pain, the whispers in her mind. I had been fortunate never to fully succumb to the infection, but she had spent hours, days, weeks in the clutches of the Oak Walker’s growth. Still, I knew how it felt, and in that way, we were closer than sisters, bonded in memories too horrible to forget. I wouldn’t let her trod that path alone.

Leaning close, I produced a little wooden pendant I’d carved from a chunk of pine, crude and angular, but sanded smooth enough to prevent splinters. It was a lantern, a tiny wooden lantern with the inside of the vault painted with gold to stand in for a flame. While I didn’t get much down time, there were moments of darkness for me too, nights when I woke up in a cold sweat, or brief instants of panic that hit me out of nowhere in random places. Thanks to helping Chris with a new batch of miniatures for his Christmas outreach program, carving had become my nervous tick in those times, and I didn’t know why, but my mind always went back to that golden lantern, shining in the night. Like the one I’d seen in a different place, held by different hands, perhaps this too would help guide Tarren home.

“Whenever you can’t sleep.” I handed her the pendant and closed her little fingers over it. “Light a candle and hold this tight as you can. When you do, I want you to say one thing to yourself, out loud, until you feel better again.”

Her face contorted in a mix of hope and confusion, Tarren waiting for the necessary words that must have sounded like a magic recipe to her young mind.

Seeing a pair of gentle silver irises in my mind, I rubbed one thumb over the little girl’s cheek to wipe the tears away. “*You have no idea how loved you are*.”

I had to her repeat it back to me until Tarren could say it without stumbling over the words. She thanked me with another hug, and it took a superhuman force of willpower just to walk away. However, when I looked back over my shoulder, Tarren was peering at the lantern in her hands, lips moving with the silent mantra, eyes filled with something like hope.

*He can hear you, Tarren. He’s right there. Just look closer.*

As we walked to the front of the lineup, Peter glanced at me out of the corner of his one good eye. “You sure ya don’t need us to stick around for a few more days? Me and the lads don’t mind the heavy liftin.”

“The snow’s going to get deeper the longer we wait.” I thumped along with my cane, a bittersweet frown on my face as we stopped next to the poles that would soon become our main gate. “I’m sure the *Harper’s Vengeance* will need repairs before she can put to sea again, and the roads from here to there won’t be easy. Chris and I will come visit as soon as we can.”

“I’ll have to build a spare room in the fort then.” Peter rested his hand on the hilt of Grace’s rapier, the ornate sword hanging from his hip, and I noted how calm he seemed. The old weariness, torment, and sadness were long gone, and Peter gobbled up the morning sunshine with hungry eyes. He was ready, ready for a fresh start, a new life.

*Hopefully a long and happy one.*

“You know, I never did ask.” Staring out alongside him onto the white, snow-covered hills around us, I rested both hands on my cane for support. “You last name . . . what is it?”

“Nelson.” He smirked, and Peter made a modest shrug. “Peter G. Nelson. Honestly never had much use for it, ‘specially once I turned pirate; imagine a pirate named Nelson.”

“Maybe not a pirate.” I raised one eyebrow and recalled something Chris had told me once during our early dates at New Wilderness. “But there was a famous admiral by that name. Even had a statue of him put up in Britain somewhere.”

“Ya don’t say?” Peter’s good eye twinkled in wonder. “Well, I suppose I’ll have to read up on that, if we ever find more books. The crew could use some new stories . . . who knows, maybe I’ll try and write one for them.”

“I look forward to reading a copy.” At my wave, the rest of his caravan mounted up, and I met Peter’s eye one last time. “Fair sailing to you, Captain Nelson.”

Mounting his own horse at the front of the wagons, Peter tipped his hat with a cavalier grin and tossed one of my uniform collar pins to me that I hadn’t realized was missing. “Until next time, Commander Dekker.”

Alone, I trudged back through the camp to a quiet spot on the eastern edge of the hilltop. Here a small cherry tree had survived the ELSAR barrage that destroyed the rest of its brethren in the artisanal grove, and with most people a fair distance off, I sat down on a large stone dumped by our earth-moving crew.

Placing my rifle to one side, I slid the camera strap off my shoulder and set up a small tripod one of the mechanics fashioned for me. I popped in the last SD card I had, two plastic containers full of them in my camera case and positioned the lens to face me.

My thumb hit *record,* and I sat back on the stone to clear my throat. “So, um . . . this is going to be my last video. I want to state for the record that I am not suicidal, this is not a death note, and I am in good health. This is . . . well, this is me saying goodbye.”

A hard wave of emotion hit me at that word, and I had to blink back the mixed feelings as I thought of what I was doing.

*Focus, Hannah. This is important. You can do this, you have to.*

“Everything you need to know should be recorded in the memory cards.” Staring at the tiny image of myself in the side screen, I looked back into the dark lens, holding up a stack of papers, notebooks, and files. “Along with a complete roster of the accounts collected by Professor Carheim. I also had one of the girls at the university transcribe my recordings on one of the computers we got shipped in during ELSAR’s last aid convoy, so everything is in paper form too. There should be two sets of each in the box.”

Cold wind blew a light dusting of snowflakes over my shoulder, and I watched them dance across the scene before me. They were beautiful, clean and white, as if washing away the scars of the old world. Somehow, they made me feel stronger, and I pushed myself onward.

“If you’re watching this, then you know what to do.” I nodded at the camera, as if I were speaking directly to the person I would entrust the dossier to. “The memory cards I will go to my parents, Allen and Margerie Brun, along with one of the transcript copies. As agreed, you keep one of the paper copies of everything, and you can post or publish them however you see fit, just so long as the truth is told. I’m counting on you, so . . . please, don’t let me down.”

One of the Smugglers from the old resistance, a man who had distinguished himself in the war, had sworn he could slip across the border before the Breach took us. Due to our agreement with ELSAR, we had forbidden such things, but I secretly agreed to let this man go, if he did me one very special favor. I had remembered a contact on the other side, an old acquaintance that knew me from a summer job in my high school days, and one I was confident would be trustworthy. In return for getting both packages to this special contact, the Smuggler and his family would be escorted to the border and snuck through the ELSAR checkpoints to freedom. Then, my old coworker would hopefully do as I asked and send one of the packets to my parents, before posting everything he’d been given online. By the time ELSAR reacted, it would be too late, and the world would know the truth. Most would laugh it off, many dismiss it as mere fiction, but some would believe, and that was enough. Koranti wouldn’t be able to hide forever, and mankind would have a chance, if a slim one, to fight back. It was a risky gamble, but I’d made worse decisions than that before.

*We’ll be ancient history by tomorrow anyway.*

Looking at my hands, I drew a deep, shuddery breath, and tried not to envision how much blood they had shed. “Now, I want to speak directly to my mom and dad.”

My heart beat a thousand miles a minute, as if they would step out from behind the camera to surprise me, but I straightened up and thought of their loving faces. “If you’ve watched the other videos, or read the transcript, then you’ve heard my story up to now. As much as it seems like some crazy hoax, as much as you’ll want to believe it’s all fake, please, trust what I’ve told you. I am alive, and I’m safe.”

A tear managed to crest my left eyelid, but I brushed it away stubbornly. “I wish you could have met Chris. I know you would have liked him, Dad. He would have been so nervous to meet you, but I think you would have gotten along. He’s good to me, kind, gentle. He reminds me of you, sometimes.”

Still the feelings rose in my throat, tried to choke me, and I fought not to sob. “Mom, I . . . I miss you. There’s a video from our wedding in one of the SD cards, I guess someone had a working camera and thought to record it all. I know we didn’t always get along, but I hope I made you proud. I wouldn’t be who I am if it weren’t for you. I know we’ll see each other again someday, even if not the way you’d want.”

Pain, old and familiar at this point, grew in my chest, a coarse sensation that wanted to stifle me. I couldn’t let it. This was too important. I had to carry on, to finish this.

They had to be told.

*Give me strength, Adonai.*

“I love you both, more than you could ever know.” I squeezed my eyes shut, and my voice cracked as hot salty waves rolled down my cheeks. “I always will. That’s why I wanted to make this recording just for you, because you deserve to know something.”

Across my face came a smile, a real smile, one that burst with the secret whispered to me in the sunlit meadows of Tauerpin Road. “You’re going to be grandparents. I know, it should be too soon to tell, but let’s just say I have it on good authority. I haven’t told Chris yet, I want to surprise him. If it’s a boy, I’d like to name him Rodrick, after Chris’s grandfather. If it’s a girl . . .”

The breeze rustled my hair, sending strands of brown and gold twirling before my eyes. Despite the winter chill, it almost seemed warm, as if from a distant summer memory, and I glanced down at the rifle by my side. While heavier than my old Type 9, the Kalashnikov gleamed under a thin coat of oil, scuffed and scratched, but reliable. Across the ground in front of me, dozens upon dozens of picture frames stood amongst the snow, staked into the ground under the cherry tree with a multitude of smiling faces. They had been copied at the university by one of the few remaining printers, encased in laminate to guard against the weather. Names were painted on the frames under each, and the one closest to me bore a man and a girl with similar facial features. Their bleach-blonde hair played in the sunlight, their uniform shirts boasting ‘New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve’ on the pocket, and tucked into the frame alongside it, was our picture.

*Man, that cake was good, wasn’t it? I never danced so much in my whole life. The dress you got me was so beautiful too . . .*

Laughing as I wept, I let grief mingle with joy until both melded into a torrent of feeling, not painful so much as grateful. Perhaps someday I would grow old so that the places, times, and dates faded into obscurity, but a part of me knew I could never forget the ones who guided me here.

Here, where I was always meant to be.

“If it’s a girl . . .” Resting my gaze on the camera, I let the wind whisper in my ear, the sun warm on my face, and breathed deep the air of my country as it caressed the cherry tree. “. . . I’m going to call her Jamie.”",1,1760621672.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1o869ke,https://www.reddit.com/r/BibleVerseCommentary/comments/1o869ke/what_was_a_leviathan_or_a_behemoth/,What was a leviathan or a behemoth?,"u/Thin-Computer-937, u/miaumerrimo, u/Fun-Cow-1783, u/Coffee-and-puts

Job 40:
>15 Take a look at Behemoth, which I made, just as I made you. It eats grass like an ox.

Job 41:
>1 Can you pull in **Leviathan** with a fishhook
or tie down its tongue with a rope?

Some thought Leviathan and Behemoth were amphibious. Benson Commentary:
>But some later and very learned men take the **leviathan** to be the **crocodile**, and the **behemoth** to be a creature called the **hippopotamus**, or river-horse, which may seem to be fitly joined with the crocodile, both being very well known to Job and his friends, as being frequent in the adjacent places, both **amphibious**, living and preying both in the water and upon the land, and both being creatures of great bulk and strength.

Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
>behemoth—The description in part agrees with the **hippopotamus**, in part with the **elephant**, but exactly in all details with neither. It is rather a poetical personification of the great Pachydermata, or Herbivora (so ""he eateth grass""), the idea of the hippopotamus being predominant. In Job 40:17, ""the tail like a cedar,"" hardly applies to the latter (so also Job 40:20, 23, ""Jordan,"" a river which elephants alone could reach, but see on [560]Job 40:23). On the other hand, Job 40:21, 22 are characteristic of the **amphibious** river horse. So leviathan (the twisting animal), Job 41:1, is a generalized term for cetacea, pythons, saurians of the neighboring seas and rivers, including the **crocodile**, which is the most prominent, and is often associated with the river horse by old writers. ""Behemoth"" seems to be the Egyptian Pehemout, ""**water-ox**,"" Hebraized, so-called as being like an ox, whence the Italian bombarino.

Barnes:
>It is an **amphibious** animal, or an animal whose usual resort is the river, though he is occasionally on land. This is evident, because he is mentioned as lying under the covert of the reed and the fens; as abiding in marshy places, or among the willows of the brook, Job 40:21-22, while at other times he is on the mountains, or among other animals, and feeds on grass like the ox, Job 40:15, Job 40:20. This account would not agree well with the elephant, whose residence is not among marshes and fens, but on solid ground.

Ancient writers often paired crocodiles and hippopotamuses together. Then perhaps Leviathan was a crocodile, and Behemoth was a hippopotamus.

> As they are here grouped together in the argument, it is probable that they belong to the same class; and if by the leviathan is meant the ""crocodile,"" then the presumption is that the river-horse, or the hippopotamus, is here intended. These two animals, as being Egyptian wonders, are everywhere mentioned together by ancient writers; see Herodotus, ii.-69-71; Diod. Sic. i. 35; and Pliny, ""Hist. Nat."" xxviii. 8.

Job 40:
>17 He makes his tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together.

Benson thought it could be a hippo:
>Job 40:17. He moveth his tail like a cedar — Though the tail be but short, both in the elephant, and in the **hippopotamus**; yet, when it is erected, it is exceeding stiff and strong. The sinews of his stones, &c. — Rather, of his thighs, as the Hebrew may be rendered. The thighs and feet of the river- horse are so sinewy and strong that one of them is able to break or overturn a large boat.

These were guesses. Some think that Behemoth and Leviathan are poetic embodiments of overwhelming, untamable forces of chaos, evil, and pride.

1o868rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o868rr/the_book_of_seers_by_elsoto/,The Book of Seers by E.L.Soto,"It was a quaint rare books store, situated in the basement of a centuries old building, a few blocks from Dublin’s Temple Bar district. The building itself was reputedly the site of a gruesome slaughter of a family and because of this, real estate agents were not able to consistently occupy the building with tenants, except for Sir William Hopkins, that is. He was a curious man, to say the least, but respectful and reticent. He stood tall and wiry with thin, white hair that he swooped to the side atop his shiny dome. He was known as *The Skeleton Man* by the children that lived in the area. They’d snicker and giggle as he passed their windows on the way to and from having Irish breakfast, every morning, at *Ginger’s.* He seemed as an awkward robot to them as he strode down the cobbled streets in rhythmic patterns, his expression stoic and barren.

The thin, wooden shelves in Sir Hopkins’ store bent under the weight of books meticulously sorted by author and genre. It smelled of mildew and old pulp - a smell very comforting to him. He set coffee to brew and scanned through *The Dublin Times* as the liquid percolated and dripped. His loyal coal-black feline, Mina, purred and circled his feet as he waited. He tapped a mahogany pipe on his teeth and said, “Oh, the evil and greed of this world, Mina. How lovely.”

When the coffee was ready, Sir Hopkins poured a cup, only adding honey to it and stood before the locked glass case that held a solitary book - The Book Of Seers. Its cover was a black most would never witness. It was as if light had difficulty escaping its surface. Some would even say that it changed between black and a deep, midnight blue, and as if waves of both colors shifted on its archaic cover. He unlocked the case and retrieved the book, as he did each morning. Sipping his coffee, he opened the book to see if the previous story’s ending was complete. A muffled cry was heard emanating from deep within the book’s pages. “Shhh,” Sir Hopkins said. To his pleasant surprise, the previous story’s final paragraph had been written after a four year wait. 

“Ah, finally!” Sir Hopkins exclaimed as he read the ending then let forth an exuberant, wheezing laugh. “I certainly didn’t expect it to end *that* way, Mina, but it’s what he deserved. Time for a new, delightfully tragic story,” he said, closing the book and turning his computer on. Hundreds of wealthy rare book enthusiasts and supernaturalists alike, eagerly awaited an email from Sir William Hopkins, hoping to discover that a new story was ready to be written. After the announcement of such, a ferocious bidding war would ensue on the website for *Hopkins’ Rare Books and Museum.* The bidders had but 24 hours to place the highest bid and win. The winning bidder would be afforded the privilege of having their life story written, including the exact time and circumstances of their death, right before their very eyes, in the Book Of Seers. As you can imagine, knowing the time, date and circumstances of one’s death can be a very powerful element in one’s life, but the final paragraph wasn’t viewable to Sir Hopkins until the paying client finally achieved their ultimate demise, whether it be in a month’s time or years later.

Sir Hopkins composed the group email and sent it off, knowing that his complete day would be consumed with watching the bidding war unfold while monitoring it as such. He set the minimum bid at 25,000 Euros and it shot up almost immediately. 30,000 from Scotland, 50,000 from Spain, 60,000 from America, etc. As the amounts increased exponentially, Sir Hopkins sat back in his chair and read Bram Stoker’s *Dracula,* his favorite book and one of which he knew almost completely by heart. Later he ordered lunch from *Finnigan’s Deli* and they promptly delivered. As he lunched with tea, he would occasionally glance at the computer screen and smirk. 150,000 from Romania, 160,000 from Germany, 170,000 again from America, etc. 

As the afternoon skulked into the depths of evening, the bidding war abated. All but two bidders had dropped off. It was between Romania and America and they were locked at 220,000 Euros before the American posted a 250,000 Euro bid. This continued until Sir Hopkins was no longer able to keep his eyes open. When the night could no longer achieve a deeper shade of black, he retired to his cot in the far corner of the room and slept, with Mina curling up by his side. 

The following morning, after breakfast at *Ginger’s*, Sir Hopkins opened his computer again to see who had won the bidding war. His name was Chip Thompson and he was from Midland, Texas. The final winning bid was for 300,000 Euros. Sir Hopkins retrieved a piece of thick yellow parchment paper from his desk, along with a fountain pen and wrote a letter as follows:  

*Dear Mr. Thompson,* 

*Congratulations on winning the bidding war to have your life and death written before you in the Book Of Seers. As cliche as it may seem, the reading will take place on the eve of All Hallow’s Eve, October 30th of this year (2014). It is very important that you arrive at Hopkins’ Rare Books And Museum no later than 9pm on the date stated above. I can not emphasize this more. Arriving any later will void the contract and your money will be refunded. Please wire all monies promptly to the account number listed below.*

*Once again, congratulations and I look forward to meeting with you in one month’s time.*

*Sincerely,*

*Sir William Hopkins*

Sir Hopkins sealed the letter with wax and sent it off. It was a week before the letter arrived in Texas and money due to Sir Hopkins was promptly wired into his account. He went about his usual business of meeting with rare book enthusiasts, several times a week, and by appointment only. Some would buy books but most often not. It didn’t matter to Sir Hopkins though. His passion was for the stories inside and that was more important than money itself (although he had amassed a small fortune throughout the years). Being a quite peculiar man, and socially awkward, the characters in his favorite books were his only friends that he could visit with at will, and he regretted each time a book was sold. 

The morning of October 30th finally arrived and Sir Hopkins prepped for the evening. He dusted the store meticulously, vacuumed its floor and cleaned the antique mirrors throughout, as well as the glass and wrought iron case that the book was held in. As the 9 o'clock hour approached, he retreated to the back area and put on his best (albeit vintage) suit and then retrieved a bottle of Louis XIII Cognac, which would be part of Mr. Thompson’s consolation prize. He sat at his old desk, fixed his tie and arranged various items. 

At 8:33, there was a loud banging on the front gate. Sir Hopkins opened the front door to find a hulking, red-faced man stuffed into a suit and tie, waiting eagerly just beyond the gate and illuminated by a dull light bulb just inside the gate. 

“Mr. Hopkins?” the man asked.

“Sir Hopkins,” he replied. “Mr. Thompson, I presume?”

“Yep, that’s me. I know I’m early but I didn’t wanna be late. Hope that’s okay with you.”

“Perfectly fine. Please come in,” Sir Hopkins replied, opening the frail iron gate (after a brief struggle with the lock) and letting Thompson pass through. A column of biting wind followed close behind him, and stirred a stack of papers on Hopkin’s desk.

“Nice...uh, place you got here,” Thompson said as Mina jumped atop the highest bookshelf  and peered down upon them with deep-yellow, obsidian eyes. 

“Thank you. It’s where I call home. Please have a seat,” said Sir Hopkins, motioning to a tattered leather recliner opposite his small, mahogany desk. 

Thompson sat down and loosened his tie. “You live here?”

“Yes. Yes I do. I have a small cot in the back,” Sir Hopkins replied, sitting at his desk.

“You don’t get claustrophobic with all these dusty books all around you?”

“No, it’s actually quite comfy. This - this is all I need in life,” Sir Hopkins said, looking around the shop. “Everything else just crumbles and fades with time. The written word is mankind’s last romantic medium and...in many ways, it’s all we have left,” replied Sir Hopkins, feeling himself being swiftly lost in his own statement. 

“Well, I don’t know bout’ that, Mr. er *Sir* Hopkins. I kinda like the excesses of life. That’s just crazy,” Thompson said, laughing heartily. “You don’t got a loved one or someone to help you out? To...to clean up the place maybe?”

“I did. I loved once, if you can believe that, Mr. Thompson,” said Sir Hopkins with a rare glimmer appearing in his eyes. He was no longer in that moment with Thompson - but rather in a place that existed beyond this realm. As if a gash between dimensions had appeared and he was peering through it. As he progressed in years, these moments of reflection seemed to happen more often and he accepted the self-realization that he may be slipping into the inevitable stage of senility.

“And what happened?” Thompson asked, feeling awkward. 

“I gave her my soul without restraint. Her...her beauty was unbridled and fluorescent,” Sir Hopkins replied, a restrained grin appearing on his face. Mina sneezed and it brought Sir Hopkins back to the moment. “But that’s neither here nor there. Let’s move along, shall we?”

“Alrighty then,” Thompson replied, scouring the room until his gaze fell upon the wrought iron and glass case above and behind Sir Hopkins. “Is that it? *The* book, I mean?”

“Yes it is but we will talk more about that in a bit. First, let’s get down to business. The way this will unfold is that we will have a brief moment to get to know each other before I will be on my way and leave you with the book. I’ll answer any questions you have in that time as well. Sound fair?”

“Sounds fair to me.”

“Good. Now first and foremost, Congratulations, Mr. Thompson. What you have accomplished is what many people around the world wish they had. As part of your prize, I give you this,” Sir Hopkins reached under his desk and withdrew the bottle of Louis XIII Cognac and set it on the desk.

“That’s for me? I love that stuff. I have a bottle at home.”

“Good to know. Would you care to have a bit now?”

“Well, shit! Is the Pope Catholic?” Sir Hopkins rolled his eyes subtly then retrieved a small snifter from his desk and handed it to Thompson. Thompson poured some Cognac, quickly chugged it then poured more. 

“So where are you from, exactly, Mr. Thompson?”

“Call me Chip. I’m from Midland, Texas. Oil country.”

“Is that where you amassed your wealth, Chip?”

“Well, my daddy did. Same thing I guess.”

“I see. I’ve always wondered, what is Texas like? Is it as we see in the movies? Cowboys with big trucks, etc?” asked Sir Hopkins, lighting his pipe. “Do you mind if I smoke while we chat?”

“It’s your place. Do what you want. Texas - well, it’s kinda like that. I mean, where I’m from, we drive around big trucks and wear cowboy hats but that’s only because we’re in oil country. Now if you go up to Austin or Dallas, those are city folk. You don’t see much of my kind there. I head up to Lake Travis once in a while. I got a boat docked there but other than that, I prefer Midland.”

“Well, that’s quite disappointing to hear. I had this romantic idea of Texas being a place of gunfights and lawlessness,” said Sir Hopkins taking a deep drag from his pipe and releasing the smoke as a long, white column that dissipated into the rafters above. Mina sneezed then licked her paws. 

“Well, you’re in the wrong century then, buddy,” laughed Thompson, as he poured another snifter of Cognac. “Want some?”

“No thank you. I don’t drink.” 

Thompson noticed the book that sat on Sir Hopkins’ desk. “You like Dracula too, huh? I got a first edition, autographed by ol’ Bram himself. Even has an etching of Dracula by Bram on the last page.”

Sir Hopkins placed his pipe on the desk and peered at Thompson intently. “You - you have *the* first edition of Dracula with an etching by Mr. Stoker himself? I wonder, dear Chip, if you know the value of such an item? I’ve searched endlessly for that book only to now discover that it is *you* that has it,” Sir Hopkins said, scoffing. “And how exactly did you come about such a treasure, if I may ask?”

“I liked the book so I just asked my buddy in London to find me a rare edition of it. He found some old kook that had one but didn’t wanna sell until we offered him a price he couldn’t refuse. It’s a pretty cool book. I have it in some old chest somewhere.” Sir Hopkins only leaned back in his chair and stroked his beard, attempting to not scowl. “Wanna buy it?” asked Thompson, winking.

“Not anymore, but thank you for asking. Now do you have any questions for me before I leave you alone with the book for the night?”

“Well, hell yeah. I got lotsa questions. First of all, where you from?“

“I was born and raised in England but I've been living in Ireland for forty one years now.”

“Why would you wanna live in such a boring, gloomy place? Doesn’t the constant cloudiness bother you? Man, it would drive me nuts.”

Sir Hopkins rose from his chair and poured water, from the small sink adjacent to his cash register, into a small cooking pot. He turned on the small electric burner and placed the pot onto it. “Would you like a cup of tea, Chip?”

“Not unless you’re going to put some whiskey in it,” replied Thompson, loosening his tie and unbuttoning the top button of his shirt. “I hate wearin’ ties. Makes me feel like a monkey or something.”

“I can certainly do that for you. To answer your question, I actually prefer the clouds to sun and I love Ireland’s beautiful history and torrid past. I revel in the ghosts that haunt its very crevices. Like this little shop, in fact.” The water began to boil and Sir Hopkins poured the boiling water into two small porcelain cups and placed a small tea bag of Chamomile into each to steep. He then discreetly reached into a nook, off to his left, and retrieved a small pewter flask, opened it and poured liquid from it into one of the tea cups, along with some Cognac. He placed it before chip. “It will do you good and calm your nerves,” he said, before sitting back down at the desk.

“Much appreciated. Wait...this place is haunted?” asked Thompson, scouring the room then taking a sip of tea. “That is really good tea.”

“Oh, it’s very haunted,” said Sir Hopkins, smirking as if enjoying watching Thompson squirm. “As a matter of fact, a whole family was brutally murdered in the room right above us. The mother’s neck was cut so severely that she was nearly decapitated.” Sir Hopkins sipped his tea and smiled.

“Man, that’s seriously messed up. I guess that’s why it’s so cold and dreary in here, huh? Anyway, I have to ask; if that book is so damn valuable, why is it just sitting there in a little glass case that anybody can break into? I mean, that gate up front - my niece could break into that.” Thompson scoffed, before taking another sip of tea. 

“Oh, but it has been stolen, Chip. Six years ago, as a matter of fact. It was returned promptly after though.”

“Returned? Who the hell would return that? Especially with how much it’s supposedly worth.” Thompson looked around the shop again and shifted in his chair.

“Are you uncomfortable, Chip? Too cold in here?”

“A little but this’ll warm me up,” he said, pouring more Cognac and drinking it.

“To answer your question, the person who stole the book seemed to have a psychotic episode of sorts shortly after stealing it. He stated that he couldn’t stand the screeching voices in his head anymore and promptly returned the book then admitted himself into Dublin’s finest mental hospital. He subsequently hung himself with sheets in his room. You see, word on the street is that if you steal the book you’ll go mad so - basically it’s safe now.”

“Damn. What kind of voices? Wait, that ain’t gonna happen to me when I open that book, right? I didn’t pay that much money to hear voices,” Thompson said. Mina meowed boorishly.

“Probably not but don’t you worry. That only happens when the book is taken from its rightful owner without permission. You’ve been given permission to handle the book so all is fine,” responded Sir Hopkins, taking another long drag from his pipe. 

“Whew. So, how exactly did you get the book?”

“On my way to Mexico City for a rare book convention, I took the enchanted byway and stopped in a small village called Santa Catarina to eat and rest. It so happened that I encountered a queer little man, very interested in my leather-bound book, *The Hobbit*, that I had been carrying at the time, if you can believe that.” Sir Hopkins took a sip of tea. “In exchange, he offered me that very book. Poor little fellow. I don’t believe he understood the value of such a thing. He obtained it from an Irish Monk that was passing through as well.”  Hopkins tapped his pipe on an ashtray to empty its burnt contents. “Apparently the book is haunted by a Celtic Seer who was banished to haunt the book for ten centuries, because she fell in love and fostered a child with an English Lord. She won’t be liberated from the confines of this book for four hundred more years or so.”

“Ah, come on. That’s just a tall tale, right? Sounds ridiculous,” Chip responded. Sir Hopkins only peered at Chip, sighing deeply and shaking his head. 

“You have till 7 a.m. sharp tomorrow morning, Chip, before the book will stop writing. If you happen to close your eyes for a significant amount of time, the book will stop writing automatically. I can’t stress how important it is that you stay awake. May I make you a pot of coffee?”

“Nah. I ain’t worried about it. I didn’t pay that much money to just fall asleep. I’ll be okay. I’m gonna beat death. Gonna meet him head on and beat em’. I guarantee you that,” Thompson responded, his words beginning to slur.

“Indeed,” Hopkins replied. He stood then unlocked and opened the case in which the book was housed. He retrieved it then placed it on the desk before Thompson who only looked upon it with fascination. Hopkins gathered his belongings then said, “Well, I’m off then, Chip. If you don’t mind, Mina will stay here with you to...to protect you from the ghosts.” Hopkins smiled then winked.

“Uh...you’re kidding, right?” Thompson replied, tapping his foot and clearing his throat.

“Unfortunately, I’m not a man known for his jokes, but not to worry, Chip. My little Mina is a lot tougher than she looks. Have a wonderful evening and I will see you at 7 a.m. sharp.” Hopkins exited the shop and locked the iron gate behind him.

“Shit,” Thompson said under his breath before taking a long sip of tea. He removed his tie and sport coat before standing and walking down the aisles of the shop. Mina eyed him with curiosity as he pulled different books from their shelves and put them back after thumbing through their pages. “Hmm...” he said, before standing in front of the Book Of Seers. He inhaled deeply then adjusted his shoulders as one would do before a significant event. “Let’s do this.” He grabbed the book, amazed at how heavy it seemed. It was as if the gravity of its unfortunate stories lay deep in the confines of its pages. 

He sat, opened the book and was astonished to find the thick, frayed pages blank until they began to flip themselves to a portion three quarters of the way through. Then it began to write; *The Life And Death Of Chip Thompson* scrolled before his eyes, that were gawking at this point. The sentences began to scroll before him, beginning at his birth. The information was absolutely correct in detail and Thompson gasped when every significant moment of his life was written. He poured more Cognac and drank it. When the ninth page began to write, he heard muffled whispers and cackling from somewhere within the shop. “Who’s there?” he said in a trembling voice and looking towards Mina. She only looked down upon him with nonchalance.

The book continued to write as Thompson followed the sentences intently. He would laugh at times when the book recalled fond memories of his childhood and cry at others. His attention was interrupted by the same whispers and cackling he had heard before yet this time it appeared to be coming from above him. “Damnit, who’s there?!” he said, looking upwards. The book stopped writing the moment he looked away. “Damn kids.” He looked back upon the book and it began writing feverishly again. As the hours passed, Thompson became drowsy with a heavy cocktail of Cognac, jet lag and sleep deprivation. He began to nod off when Mina jumped from atop the bookshelf, hissed then scurried under Thompson’s chair. “What the hell,” he said, scanning the room erratically. “Mina, you crazy cat. Cut that shit out now. Jesus.”

As the 4:00 a.m. hour approached, Thompson struggled to keep his leaden eyelids open. When the wall clock struck 4:26 a.m. he succumbed to weariness (or something more sinister) and fell into a deep slumber, with the book open and upon his lap. The murmurs perpetuated throughout the room as Mina perched herself upon the highest bookshelf again and slept. “Another lost to the pages,” one disembodied voice whispered from somewhere along the bookshelves. “Poor soul,” another voice said in response. “He hadn’t a chance.”

Thompson was awoken by the sound of Sir Hopkins struggling with the lock on the front gate. He looked up to see the wall clock at 6:59 a.m. In a panic he looked down and read the final paragraph of his story quickly, attempting to memorize it as best he could:

*In the early morning of July 2nd of 2017, Chip Thompson was woken in the middle of the night by a sound that no man could ever mistake. It was the sound of somebody breaking into his home. He grabbed his revolver from the nightstand and crept to the hallway where he discovered a shadow in the shape of a man standing at the far end of it. Thompson quickly raised his gun and*

Although the paragraph ended abruptly, Thompson could only surmise that this was how he was to die and that the book was successful in its prophecy. The front gate finally creaked open and he could hear Sir Hopkins shuffling through the doorway. Mina jumped down from the bookshelf and circled his feet, purring. “Good morning, Chip. Your eyes look haggard. Did you fall asleep, by chance?”

“Yeah - yeah, a little bit but...I still got my story,” he replied, rubbing his eyes. “Death by robbery. I’m good.”

Sir Hopkins looked down upon the book that was on Thompson’s lap, smirking. He picked up the book and closed it before securing it in its glass case again. “Well then, our business is done here and I have much to do today, Chip. If you’re hungry, you’ll find that *Ginger’s,* right around the corner, offers a wonderful Irish breakfast.”

Thompson yawned, then stood and gathered his sport coat and tie. “Yeah, I could eat a horse. I think I’ll do that,” he replied, before extending his hand to Sir Hopkins who only looked down upon it. 

“Forgive me if I don’t shake your hand, Chip. It’s...well, it’s just a thing I have. I left the gate open for you.” Thompson nodded his head then walked towards the exit. “Happy trails or however they say it in Texas,” Sir Hopkins said, when Thompson was out of audible range. 

A little less than three years passed without incident and with Sir Hopkins going diligently about his daily routine. When the morning of July 3rd, 2017 arrived, Sir Hopkins opened the book to find the final paragraph written. He gasped with delight as he read it aloud to Mina: *Shots were fired and the intruder fell dead. When Chip Thompson turned the lights on, to his horror, he discovered that the dead intruder was in fact his drunk son, who had left his keys at home. He had attempted to sneak in quietly in order to not wake his father. In a state of panic, Chip Thompson ran outside for help when he was struck by a speeding work truck that was passing by at the exact moment he bounded into the street. A neighbor, who witnessed the horrible accident, reported his last words to be; ‘That book...that fuckin’ lyin’ book.’ If Chip Thompson had simply called out to the stranger before firing, he would have ultimately lived a life of relative happiness and well into his seventies and with four grandchildren. May God rest his soul. The end*. Sir Thompson sighed deeply. “Don’t you look at me like that, Mina. Sometimes the hands of fate have to be nudged in the right direction to make our world a better place.” 

Eight mornings later, Sir Hopkins opened the book and was startled when it suddenly flipped pages and a sentence began to write automatically. *The Life And Death Of Sir William Hopkins* scrolled before his eyes. He only looked upon it, as one does when something horribly intriguing occurs before you, yet unable to look away. He followed the writing, his heart thudding within his chest, until it caught up with present time. *As Sir William Hopkins followed the writing of his own life scrolling out before him, he felt an immense pressure and pain within his chest. He gasped and clutched his chest desperately before...*

“My dear Mina. My dear, dear Mina...” he hoarsely whispered before his body became limp in his chair - the book still open upon his lap. In the week following, Mina sat atop the highest bookshelf, reduced to a clump of skin on bones as she gazed upon the decaying body of her former owner. Her eyes displayed that of one very close to entering the next plane. Two mornings later, Mina lay her head upon the shelf and closed her eyes for the final time. 

“T’is a shame the cat had to die too, eh?” a disembodied voice said from the bookshelves.

“T’is a shame indeed,” another disembodied voice replied. “Another lost to the pages.”

More detail in comments.,"I have a Z390 Pro4 motherboard. I have 2 sticks of 8gb RAM and an i5 9600k processor, and a 2080 graphics card. I cannot play BF6 even on the lowest possible setting, but I meet the minimum specs. I think i just don't have enough VRAM in my graphics card to run the game, as I run in slow motion while playing and when I'm in the menu I get a warning that basically says this. However, I don't think I can just upgrade my graphics card but I want to be sure I'm making the right upgrade.

 So most of the specs and advice I can get is in google, but I still want some advice. I want to upgrade from my i5 processor, it is a [Intel Core i5-9600K Coffee Lake 6-Core 3.7 GHz (4.6 GHz Turbo) LGA 1151 (300 Series) 95W BX80684I59600K Desktop Processor](https://store.yahoo.com/outletpc/cv4205.html) and I've just bought the Corsair vengeance 16gb x 2 RAM cards to replace the 8gb RAM cards that I have right now. My question is, do I need to even upgrade my processor to something like an i9 9900KS? Or can I get away with just replacing my RAM sticks? Again, I want to be careful to not just get double the RAM but also need to make a parallel upgrade somewhere else. My PSU is a corsair 750x. I have the same question for graphics cards - can I just upgrade to a better card that isn't the latest most expensive one? I'm trying to keep all of this below 500 dollars and I doubt it's possible. I may just have to refund BF6 on steam until I can justify the cost of building a new PC later down the line.

I plan on formatting a USB drive so I can install the newest BIOS update for my motherboard so I can support a better processor but if the consensus is that I don't need a new processor then I won't get one (my performance in most games is OK but sometimes I think it's a processor issue and not a graphics card issue). 

Anyway, I built this PC in 2019. None of the parts are even close to current. 

Would like some help. Thank you!",0,1760621520.0,ASRock,1,0.5,False
1o868kx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o868kx,"Lunch at Gather, Law Clg Rd","Had lunch at Gather. For 2 ppl 4000 rs. We had reserved on Zomato so got a free dessert. A costly affair but id say it was worth it (not sure when the next time will be tho, my pockets are crying 😅)

Pic 1: Eastern and Western Ghats - a mocktail of pineapple, strawberry and passion fruit juice. It was nice, not too sweet. Wouldve loved if the quantity for a more though. 3/5

Pic 2: Charred broccoli with romesco sauce, ricotta, hazelnut chilli crumb, pomegranate molasses glaze. It was a filling dish with nice quantity. Would’ve liked more spice but it delivered with crispy, smoky and tangy-ness. 3.5/5

Pic 3: Spicy miso chicken wings. This was the best dish of the afternoon. The chicken wings were fall from the bone. Grilled with nice char and was glazed completely. The accompanying sauce was also delicious. 4.5/5

Pic 4: Mushroom and Lotus Stem Gyoza. These dumplings were really delicious. the wrapper was perfect - not too thick not too thin. The held their shape properly. The filling was also yum and quantity was also good. There were around 6-7 dumplings. The accompanying sauce was also really good. 4/5

Pic 5: Pita Bread with Hummus beiruti. The portion size was really good. The pita bread were so soft. Hummus was savoury and earthy. The pickled onions cut through and provided much needed tang. 4/5

Pic 6: El diavolo pizza. The pizza base and crust was so gooodd! Thin, soft and crispy (confusing ik). This pizza is a hit for the indian palate. The chicken topping was of nice quantity. This pizza was delicious but i wouldve lived if the pizza were a bit more spicier. The tangy-ness was overpowering. 4/5

Pic 7: Coffee tres leches. Thank god the dessert was free coz we had overshot our budget 😂. The dessert was even more tastier because it was free 😂. On a serious note, the cake was extremely airy, light and spongy. It soaked the coffee milk so good. I dont have any point of reference or comparison, but what i ate tasted really good. A perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness.

All in all it was a really nice lunch. The service was exceptional. I think a group of 3 would be perfect for the amount of food being served. Good variety and taste profile. The 10% Service charge was kind of mandatory (?). The menu card did say that once you order you agree to pay service charge. So keep that in mind if visiting. Wow this review was quite big, but i think the food really deserved the praise.

1o8681k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o8681k/aitah_for_delaying_cleaning_by_one_day_in/,Aitah for delaying cleaning by one day in observance of the holiday Monday as an office cleaner?,"I clean this office on a regular schedule, the only time I make changes is when events or illness or holidays change the schedule. My usual schedule is Saturdays and Wednesdays. However, since the entire office was off Monday, the office had only been used for a single day, which for this office means there is nothing to do since the office only has 3 staff. Even on the normal work week, I'm changing only a couple trash bags and only one bathroom is used, and a couple mugs are in the sink with the coffee pot. I pushed the Wednesday cleaning to Thursday, since that would be the normal amount of time in between cleanings anyway, and then I resume the schedule this Saturday. 

However the office manager is upset about this. I however am of the understanding this is normal for cleaners to do. Not to mention it would be wasteful to change trash bags with a single paperwad in them. And then take it out, while the garbage is also running a day behind. 

The manager says the schedule has been the same for 45 years and he understands when people get sick or certain events happen but he wants me to stick to the schedule even if holidays make the office almost untouched. Which worries me because he complains about trash bags being wasted, and I know if I do what he says I'll be accused of wasting trashbags. Not to mention the office manager is kind of hoarding in the office. Not food or anything but files, boxes of files everywhere to the point l have to only vacuum narrow walkways. I suppose that's also the reason this bugs me, he himself does not organize and hoards in the office and does not attempt to shred old files or put them away, and as a cleaner I cannot touch those. I can only clean around them. Because touching them could result in lost paperwork causing issues for not only the office the the clients whose paperwork I moved. So it's a big no no. So I find it infuriating to be called out on my work ethic by someone who has no integrity for me or the state of his office. I get that the cleaning day didn't fall on Monday, but the waste of cleaning again when the office has had no time to get dirty does not seem ethical either.

I don't think it was strange on my end and I figured this was a normal thing everyone understood for most cleaning and garbage services.

Chris sighed and shook his head at the mirror. “I look like a penguin.”

In the quiet confines of our tent, he stood before a cracked mirror we’d scrounged from an abandoned house, while the woodstove in the corner crackled merrily on its embers. It wasn’t much of a shelter, but it kept the cold away and we never had snow fall on us, so that was a plus. There was enough room for our crude bed, a simple bunk knocked together from scrap lumber bearing a mattress stuffed full of old rags. Our floor had been fashioned out of wooden pallets to hold everything off the frozen mud, and a rectangular pine chest contained most of our meager belongings. During the day, our homemade wood stove put out enough heat to keep the tent fairly warm, while at night it struggled to keep ice from forming on the tent poles. We were fortunate, I knew; there were still so many out there that had nothing, despite how hard our forces worked to put more old houses bac in working order. Chris wanted to wait until he was sure most of the general populace had somewhere to go before he arranged for our own home, and I’d grown used to sleeping under several blankets. With him by my side every night, snuggled by the glow of a fire, it wasn’t so bad.

*Though I won’t mind once we have a real door that can lock. And a fireplace. And a toilet.*

With gentle hands I straightened his tie, taking in the way the suit fit him like a glove. “No, you look *handsome.* It fits you. Very distinguished.”

“So, a very distinguished penguin then.” He let slide an ornery grin and pulled me to him, both calloused hands on my waist so that my spine tingled in pleasant shivers. “You sure you can’t come early? There’s got to be room enough on the helicopter for one more.”

*Tempting, Mr. Dekker, very tempting.*

I took his face in my hands to kiss him and savored how my brain fuzzed with happy static at the sensation. “I’ll be there once everything is set here. We still have to lay groundwork for the new perimeter wall and a food storage bunker. Then there’s taking measurements for the cabins, a watchtower and—hey!”

He lifted me from the ground to settle us both down amongst the tangled sheets of our bunk with mischievous gleam in his sky-blue eyes. I had barely a second to think before his lips were on mine again, a delicious warmth in my core that by now was a familiar and welcome feeling.

“You’re. . . you’re going to be late.” I gasped as he made his way down the soft skin of my neck, our hands in a blind race to undo belts and shirt buttons.

“A president is allowed to be late.” Chris whispered in my ear and cupped a hand behind my hip to keep me tight against his body. We were both still sore with bruises from the battle for the Western Pass, but time had helped to soothe most of the worst injuries. My ankle still hurt, and it would take longer to heal than I wanted, but I didn’t need to put much stress on it for this. Clearly my husband didn’t mind his new scars enough to care either.

Running my hands over the raised bits of skin that crisscrossed his muscled chest, I gave him a playful nibble on the shoulder, conscious to avoid where sutures held fresh wounds together. “You could tear those stiches.”

His energy only heightened by my teasing, Chris discarded the last bit of fabric that kept him at bay to pull the blankets over us in a soft cocoon of linen and wool. “If you want me to stop . . .”

*Don’t you dare.*

Unable to muster any words for the way his skin felt on mine, I laced my arms around his neck and happily gave up trying to dissuade him.

Twenty minutes later, we lay side-by-side in the thoroughly rumpled bed, his suit laid out in various discarded pieces on the nearby chair, my own nightshirt lost somewhere in the blankets. Thankfully, all bandages and sutures held, the stiffness in some of my wounds fading to a drowsy contentment. Chris tucked a thick fur coverlet over us, and I rested my tangled head against his chest, shutting my eyes to bask in the moment.

*Practice certainly makes perfect.*

“I still wish we could go together.” He stroked my hair, and Chris stared up at the tent ceiling with a grim line across his lips.

Spreading my fingers across his chest, I watched the short dark hairs flatten under my palm and chewed on my lower lip in thought. As the new president of the Free American Republic, Chris had many challenges on his hands. His first order of business had been to draft and sign into effect an official Constitution for our fledgling nation, one built off the principles of the original we’d grown up with in the U.S. With the Bill of Rights restored, curfews lifted, and market reforms implemented, Chris’s popularity soared amongst the surviving population. Many local businesses reopened, the streets were cleaned of rubble, and food shortages began to wane. A joint effort between the withdrawing ELSAR forces and our own soldiers had seen the power grid restored across Black Oak, and we managed to get the water mains back online. Sewage no longer flowed in the streets, and the number of disease patients in the hospital began to go down.

Still, our greatest accomplishment was, without a doubt, the new Constitution, and I myself had been among the delegates to sign the document. It had been one of the proudest days of my life to stand beside my husband as our dream became a reality, to see Chris’s eyes twinkle with hope for the future, and to walk out onto the courthouse lawn with him to greet the cheering crowds. We’d run up our new flag, red and white striped like the old one, but with a white pine tree in the blue square instead of fifty stars, and someone had even found a stash of old fireworks to shoot off in celebration.

However, like all things, it was not a bloodless victory. With the relaxing of political suppression, the new two-house Assembly had formed ideological blocs that began to look eerily like political parties. Our own Reformists, led by Chris, made up roughly 2/3 of the total government, but a rival group of former collaborators known as the Provincials proved to be a thorn in our side. They refused to sign the new Constitution until Chris promised amnesty to most former Auxiliaries in return for a guarantee of Provincial support in reconstruction. This had in turn enraged many of the former resistance members, who splintered into other factions; most went to the Independents, but sadly a large number defected to the United Liberation Front.

Formed by Josh and his insurgent comrades, the ULF demanded the total removal of all former collaborator families from Barron County by force, the execution of all Auxiliaries and Organ members, and the handing of military authority in Black Oak to ULF forces. All efforts to negotiate with them failed, and when the Assembly refused to allow them representation in both House and Senate due to their aggressive tactics, the ULF denounced our government as illegitimate. They carried out three separate car bomb attacks on our security units in Black Oak and tried to vandalize warehouse where our aid was stored in order to prevent it from reaching the poorer districts. Chris had officially declared them a terrorist organization which meant that, in a strange twist of fate, our troops ended up patrolling alongside the last of the ELSAR soldiers before the latter’s withdrawal to keep the bloodshed at a minimum. While there were multiple ULF attacks to investigate, my scouts reported having trouble with an unidentified sniper who harassed our police units without end, and I dreaded the day I would look down my rifle sights to find Lucille staring back at me. We had won the war, but it seemed true peace would continue to elude us for quite some time.

Still, not all was dark in the road ahead. As the Secretary of Human Welfare for Chris’s cabinet, Sandra Abernathy worked night and day to restore medical services within the town and acted as an envoy to the most impoverished districts in order to gain their support for further reforms. Ethan Sanderson won over the working class with ease, mediating between them and local business owners for pay, benefits, and improved conditions, thus avoiding multiple strikes. He’d wanted to go back to being a simple mechanic, but Chris eventually convinced him to accept the role of Vice President, for which Ethan turned out to be well suited. Black Oak University had been renamed the Carheim Institute, and with a book donation campaign from surviving residents, the old library was brought back to its former glory. I had a painting of Professor Carheim done by one of his former apprentices from the underground, and it hung just inside the entrance along with an inscription in old Latin that read, ‘Those who reach for the light of truth have no need to fear the darkest of lies.’

The real surprise came when one of the newspapers, a Provincial-friendly one no less, ran a story about our soldiers protecting civilians from reprisals during the siege of Black Oak.

In a shock to me, one of the interviewees happened to mention my name, and somehow a picture of me running down the street during the northern district massacre appeared in one of the local magazines, likely taken from a refugee that had been hidden in the bombed-out houses. Just like that, I went from a secondary figure in the new government to a pseudo-celebrity, and my face appeared on pro-reconstruction posters all over the city. Stylists copied the golden streaks in my hair for dozens of girls, tattoo artists ran out of silver ink due to sheer demand, and it got to where I was more worried about being mobbed by fans than attacked by insurgents every time I went anywhere. I found that I hated being so famous, unable to move about in town without an armed escort, but it did come in handy with the one project other I led inside the walls of Black Oak.

At the center of town, in the same square so many had been killed during the fighting, I had a temporary wooden pillar erected in place of a stone one that would replace it in future, once our quarries were operational. Onto this pillar, I carved the names of all the recovered coalition dog tags and captured ELSAR ID cards I had, along with every single name in Kaba’s little black book. He was given the place of honor at the top, *Adrit Veer Kabanagarajan*, along with *Andrea Louise Campbell,* and *Sean Fredrick Hammond*. Without any records as to his real name, I put *Tex* there as well, knowing he wouldn’t have wanted much spotlight anyway. I invited everyone from all sides in the Assembly to the opening ceremony and gave them the chance to write down the name of a loved one they would like to see etched onto the pillar. It didn’t matter who they were, which side they were on, or why they had died; the pillar was for everyone, for all the lost souls who hadn’t lived through the nightmare we’d barely survived. I called it Remembrance Square, and never a day went by that there wasn’t some kind of wreath, bouquet, or candle left at its base by a grieving family. It wasn’t much, but as Chris assured me, it was the first in a long series of steps towards healing.

“I’ll be there before dark.” I curled one leg around him and clung to Chris’s torso with both arms to soak in the heat radiating off his chiseled frame. “Once I know New Wilderness is secure for the night, I’ll come find you. I promise.”

He planted a tender kiss on my forehead. “I’ll hold you to that. First Ladies need to keep their promises. Besides, once the new road is paved, we can move the presidential residence out here and avoid the traffic altogether.”

That drew a smile from me, both in the thought of living closer to the reserve, and at the idea that our cozy little farm wasn’t so far in the future. “Not sold on being an urbanite, huh?”

“My grandfather had it right.” Chris rubbed my shoulder and stared upward through the green canvas ceiling in thought. “A sturdy house, a good piece of land, and a beautiful family is more than enough in this life. Once my term is up, I figure if you won’t mind helping me build the house, I can get us the land, and then maybe we can work on that last part some more.”

*I think we’re well past ‘maybe’, Mr. Dekker.*

My face heated up, and I kept both eyes on his satin-steel chest to avoid giving my giddy smile away. “I’d like that.”

We lay there for another few minutes, before my battered alarm clock rang to inform us that he was, in fact, late. Together we rose to repeat the dressing process, and I shrugged on my new uniform, eyeing the golden stars on the collar in the nearby mirror.

With the war over, and the bulk of the coalition army disbanded, those who didn’t want a place in the budding government went their separate ways. Adam and Eve returned with the remainder of their brethren to Ark River, where Eve made sure her recovering husband got his rest, whether Adam felt he needed it or not. Their patrols continued to round up Puppets in order to redeem them via sunlight, though multiple Arkian women discovered they were pregnant shortly after the Breach’s collapse, and fresh marriages continued in their enclave by the day. Many of the original population of Barron County stayed in Ark River, while others traveled west to join the growing flock of people looking to reconquer the gated community near Sunbright. Some moved to Black Oak, but a few dared to venture out into the wild, with hopes of building their own fortified blockhouses, miniature settlements, or farming strongholds in the vast unclaimed lands of the countryside. Untainted by the continuous influence of the Breach, the landscape stabilized, and the tide of mutants slowed. Now it was time for mankind to do what we did best; regroup, rearm, and take back our home.

“Morning, Mr. President; the transport flight is ready at the landing pad, awaiting your orders.” As we emerged from the military surplus tent, a green-uniformed ranger came up and saluted us both. “Commander Dekker, we’ve got a supply convoy that just came in, and the captain asked where you wanted the radios to go?”

It took a moment for me to remember that he was addressing *me*, and I nodded toward the line of vehicles parked on the other side of the ridge, where bulldozers rumbled back and forth to smooth out the shell craters. “Talk to Head Ranger McPhearson. Tell him I’ll be helping with the wall construction detail this afternoon, before my flight to the capitol this evening. He’ll be briefed before I leave.”

“Yes, commander.” The boy saluted again and took off at a run.

I turned to find Chris watching me with a toothy smile. “What?”

He shook his head and slipped one hand into mine as we walked. “I do *not* miss my old post.”

“And I do *not* envy your current one.” Leaning on him to keep the weight off my sore ankle, I strode with Chris down the newly bladed road between the tents, snowflakes tumbling around us. Our medics had provided me with a cane to use until the wound healed, but while I carried it even now, I hated using the thing. It made me feel old, and I couldn’t wait until I didn’t need the creaking stick anymore. “Those Assembly sessions drive me crazy. I don’t know how you get through them without wanting to shoot someone.”

“Trust me, it’s crossed my mind.” Chris’s face dimmed somewhat, and he let out a long sigh. “But I think once enough time passes, the old problems will sort themselves out. Our first civil war didn’t end us, and we had a lot more to deal with this time around.”

Pacing through the camp, we looked on in mute thought at the fervent construction that bustled all around us. Crews worked tirelessly to operate heavy equipment, lay gravel, and haul logs to their various positions. Unlike the old New Wilderness, this one would be larger, encompassing the entire hill the reserve originally sat on, with rings of palisade walls guarding it from base to crest. Once the spring came, we planned to pour cement foundations and bring in large stone blocks from the local quarry, replacing the wooden fort with a stone castle that would outlast us all. It would serve both as a conservation center for the animal species that roamed our newborn republic, and as a command post for our peacetime military, of which I was now chief officer. Some of the structures being rebuilt were given their old names: Carnivore Cove, the Fur and Fang Veterinary Center, the Herbivore Barns. It was with a strange combination of melancholy and closure that I observed the workers raise framed walls on the central barracks, which bore the name “Elk Lodge.” In truth, it would be closer to a medieval keep by the time it was done properly in stone next spring. Part of me would always miss the old rustic lodge, where Chris and I shared our first dance, our first kiss, and our first clumsy attempt at a dinner date. It would never truly be the same . . . but then again, none of this would be. We were about to pass into a different world, a different time, and everything was once again going to change.

Reaching the helicopter pad, a flattened part of the small ridge where a Blackhawk waited, Chris stopped to adjust his tie in the way he always did before going into another heated Assembly meeting. “I’ll see you tonight, then?”

My heart skipped a fluttery beat, and I took the lapels of his suit in my hands to kiss the boy who dug me out of the moldy pile of shoes all those nights ago. “I guarantee it.”

Chris rested his forehead against mine and bore into my eyes with his. “I love you, *pragtige*.”

“And I love you, *aantreklik*.” I held him tight, satisfied at the way my rough attempt at Afrikaans made him smile. “Be safe.”

A part of my heart twinged as the helicopter whirred off to the north, but I hefted the rifle on my shoulder and made for the front gate. There, a small caravan waited for me, made up of riders on horses, bicycles, motorcycles, and a few wagons drawn by oxen. Every saddlebag bulged with supplies, the wagons piled high with everything the group might need. Tools, provisions, water, medicine, no expense had been spared. Such extravagances would be unheard of tomorrow, the first day Barron County would wake up in a new reality, cut off from ELSAR’s mandated contributions.

*But it’s not tomorrow yet.*

At my approach, a rather conspicuous figure jumped down from the lead wagon to make a sweeping bow.

“Didn’t expect you to be up, commander. Thought you decided to take the morning off.” Even with his broad hat in one hand, head bent in dramatic flair, I could still see the wry grin on Peter’s face. “Though by the look of the president’s suit, you almost did, eh?”

“Something like that.” I chuckled as he righted himself and eyed the pirate’s revitalized getup. “I like the hat.”

Peter again wore the long-tailed coat, knee-high boots, and gleaming silver rapier of a 17^(th) century buccaneer, adding a tricorn hat that someone found atop his bandana-wrapped head. A single feather poked from its silken band, and with the dark stubble lining his thin face, Peter certainly looked roguish enough to appear in a movie set somewhere. One piece of his kit was not for mere appearances, however. Over his left eye, Peter now sported a black eyepatch, the long red scar extended from either side denoting where Grapeshot’s cutlass had made its mark. Our medics tended to it the best they could, but Peter knew as well as they did that he would never see with his left eye again. Still, it hadn’t dampened his spirits.

If anything, it made him more of a rascal than ever.

Behind him, the last of those who were going south lounged on their various mounts, talking or sipping on hot coffee provided by the camp mess. In a shrewd political maneuver, Chris used the Provincials’ amnesty demand for the Organs as a loophole to waive the life sentence for Peter and his crew. Officially free men, they were granted letters of marque as privateers of the F.A.R Naval Forces. Granted, they were the *only* naval force we had, but Peter had accepted the task before the Assembly with great charm, stirring more than one adoring newspaper article written by swooning girls. Set to return to the *Harper’s Vengeance*, they would patrol the Sea of Sargosia (formerly Maple Lake) on behalf of our government, ferrying settlers to abandoned farm sites or protecting researchers while they studied mutant migrations. As well, they would aid in keeping any form of banditry off our waters, especially since a large portion of ex-Organ members had elected to leave Black Oak and move into the countryside for fear of the ULF. Many orphans volunteered to join him when Peter opened a recruitment line in the local pub, and they all looked forward to a new life on our growing inland sea.

One face in particular stuck out of the caravan, and I limped over to crane my neck at the silent figure atop the lead wagon’s seat. “Hey, you. All ready to go?”

Tarren didn’t say anything, but nodded, twisted a few thin strands of vine in her fingers to form knots. She hadn’t very much spoken since the Breach, and never smiled, a quiet shadow of the girl I’d met in the hold of the *Harper’s Vengeance.* It hurt to see, and I knew Peter was most affected by it, though he tried not to let the pain show. Of anyone, Tarren was least deserving of what she had endured, but the war had shown no favoritism to anyone.

*Curse Vecitorak and his filthy rotten soul.*

I rested my elbows on the wagon’s side and made a conspiratorial whisper in a bid to cheer her up. “I heard they’ve got an ice cream shop set to open in Black Oak. I’ll bring some with me when I come to visit, and we can eat crunchy cones together. Maybe after, you can take a trip here and pet a mammoth. They’re like elephants, but fuzzier. Sound good?”

The girl chewed her lower lip, but bobbed her head in agreement, and continued to tie knots in silence.

“Okay.” Somewhat disappointed, I turned to go, but to my surprise, a little jerk on my sleeve halted my steps.

Tarren held her arms out for a hug, and I didn’t deny her.

“I don’t sleep good.” Her whisper in my ear broke my heart, raspy from disuse and fatigue.

*I know the feeling.*

Rubbing her back, I held her tight, and felt a sympathetic wince cross my face. “Nightmares?”

She nodded, skinny fingers gripping my uniform epaulets like they were lifelines.

“I have them too.” I kissed her hair and wished I could keep the little thing with me, though I knew she was better off with her crew . . . her family. “But you want to know a secret?”

Tarren looked at me with watery eyes, on the edge of tears that she’d likely shed a thousand times already. Few could know what she’d been through, the feeling of the roots burrowing inside her skin the pain, the whispers in her mind. I had been fortunate never to fully succumb to the infection, but she had spent hours, days, weeks in the clutches of the Oak Walker’s growth. Still, I knew how it felt, and in that way, we were closer than sisters, bonded in memories too horrible to forget. I wouldn’t let her trod that path alone.

Leaning close, I produced a little wooden pendant I’d carved from a chunk of pine, crude and angular, but sanded smooth enough to prevent splinters. It was a lantern, a tiny wooden lantern with the inside of the vault painted with gold to stand in for a flame. While I didn’t get much down time, there were moments of darkness for me too, nights when I woke up in a cold sweat, or brief instants of panic that hit me out of nowhere in random places. Thanks to helping Chris with a new batch of miniatures for his Christmas outreach program, carving had become my nervous tick in those times, and I didn’t know why, but my mind always went back to that golden lantern, shining in the night. Like the one I’d seen in a different place, held by different hands, perhaps this too would help guide Tarren home.

“Whenever you can’t sleep.” I handed her the pendant and closed her little fingers over it. “Light a candle and hold this tight as you can. When you do, I want you to say one thing to yourself, out loud, until you feel better again.”

Her face contorted in a mix of hope and confusion, Tarren waiting for the necessary words that must have sounded like a magic recipe to her young mind.

Seeing a pair of gentle silver irises in my mind, I rubbed one thumb over the little girl’s cheek to wipe the tears away. “*You have no idea how loved you are*.”

I had to her repeat it back to me until Tarren could say it without stumbling over the words. She thanked me with another hug, and it took a superhuman force of willpower just to walk away. However, when I looked back over my shoulder, Tarren was peering at the lantern in her hands, lips moving with the silent mantra, eyes filled with something like hope.

*He can hear you, Tarren. He’s right there. Just look closer.*

As we walked to the front of the lineup, Peter glanced at me out of the corner of his one good eye. “You sure ya don’t need us to stick around for a few more days? Me and the lads don’t mind the heavy liftin.”

“The snow’s going to get deeper the longer we wait.” I thumped along with my cane, a bittersweet frown on my face as we stopped next to the poles that would soon become our main gate. “I’m sure the *Harper’s Vengeance* will need repairs before she can put to sea again, and the roads from here to there won’t be easy. Chris and I will come visit as soon as we can.”

“I’ll have to build a spare room in the fort then.” Peter rested his hand on the hilt of Grace’s rapier, the ornate sword hanging from his hip, and I noted how calm he seemed. The old weariness, torment, and sadness were long gone, and Peter gobbled up the morning sunshine with hungry eyes. He was ready, ready for a fresh start, a new life.

*Hopefully a long and happy one.*

“You know, I never did ask.” Staring out alongside him onto the white, snow-covered hills around us, I rested both hands on my cane for support. “You last name . . . what is it?”

“Nelson.” He smirked, and Peter made a modest shrug. “Peter G. Nelson. Honestly never had much use for it, ‘specially once I turned pirate; imagine a pirate named Nelson.”

“Maybe not a pirate.” I raised one eyebrow and recalled something Chris had told me once during our early dates at New Wilderness. “But there was a famous admiral by that name. Even had a statue of him put up in Britain somewhere.”

“Ya don’t say?” Peter’s good eye twinkled in wonder. “Well, I suppose I’ll have to read up on that, if we ever find more books. The crew could use some new stories . . . who knows, maybe I’ll try and write one for them.”

“I look forward to reading a copy.” At my wave, the rest of his caravan mounted up, and I met Peter’s eye one last time. “Fair sailing to you, Captain Nelson.”

Mounting his own horse at the front of the wagons, Peter tipped his hat with a cavalier grin and tossed one of my uniform collar pins to me that I hadn’t realized was missing. “Until next time, Commander Dekker.”

Alone, I trudged back through the camp to a quiet spot on the eastern edge of the hilltop. Here a small cherry tree had survived the ELSAR barrage that destroyed the rest of its brethren in the artisanal grove, and with most people a fair distance off, I sat down on a large stone dumped by our earth-moving crew.

Placing my rifle to one side, I slid the camera strap off my shoulder and set up a small tripod one of the mechanics fashioned for me. I popped in the last SD card I had, two plastic containers full of them in my camera case and positioned the lens to face me.

My thumb hit *record,* and I sat back on the stone to clear my throat. “So, um . . . this is going to be my last video. I want to state for the record that I am not suicidal, this is not a death note, and I am in good health. This is . . . well, this is me saying goodbye.”

A hard wave of emotion hit me at that word, and I had to blink back the mixed feelings as I thought of what I was doing.

*Focus, Hannah. This is important. You can do this, you have to.*

“Everything you need to know should be recorded in the memory cards.” Staring at the tiny image of myself in the side screen, I looked back into the dark lens, holding up a stack of papers, notebooks, and files. “Along with a complete roster of the accounts collected by Professor Carheim. I also had one of the girls at the university transcribe my recordings on one of the computers we got shipped in during ELSAR’s last aid convoy, so everything is in paper form too. There should be two sets of each in the box.”

Cold wind blew a light dusting of snowflakes over my shoulder, and I watched them dance across the scene before me. They were beautiful, clean and white, as if washing away the scars of the old world. Somehow, they made me feel stronger, and I pushed myself onward.

“If you’re watching this, then you know what to do.” I nodded at the camera, as if I were speaking directly to the person I would entrust the dossier to. “The memory cards I will go to my parents, Allen and Margerie Brun, along with one of the transcript copies. As agreed, you keep one of the paper copies of everything, and you can post or publish them however you see fit, just so long as the truth is told. I’m counting on you, so . . . please, don’t let me down.”

One of the Smugglers from the old resistance, a man who had distinguished himself in the war, had sworn he could slip across the border before the Breach took us. Due to our agreement with ELSAR, we had forbidden such things, but I secretly agreed to let this man go, if he did me one very special favor. I had remembered a contact on the other side, an old acquaintance that knew me from a summer job in my high school days, and one I was confident would be trustworthy. In return for getting both packages to this special contact, the Smuggler and his family would be escorted to the border and snuck through the ELSAR checkpoints to freedom. Then, my old coworker would hopefully do as I asked and send one of the packets to my parents, before posting everything he’d been given online. By the time ELSAR reacted, it would be too late, and the world would know the truth. Most would laugh it off, many dismiss it as mere fiction, but some would believe, and that was enough. Koranti wouldn’t be able to hide forever, and mankind would have a chance, if a slim one, to fight back. It was a risky gamble, but I’d made worse decisions than that before.

*We’ll be ancient history by tomorrow anyway.*

Looking at my hands, I drew a deep, shuddery breath, and tried not to envision how much blood they had shed. “Now, I want to speak directly to my mom and dad.”

My heart beat a thousand miles a minute, as if they would step out from behind the camera to surprise me, but I straightened up and thought of their loving faces. “If you’ve watched the other videos, or read the transcript, then you’ve heard my story up to now. As much as it seems like some crazy hoax, as much as you’ll want to believe it’s all fake, please, trust what I’ve told you. I am alive, and I’m safe.”

A tear managed to crest my left eyelid, but I brushed it away stubbornly. “I wish you could have met Chris. I know you would have liked him, Dad. He would have been so nervous to meet you, but I think you would have gotten along. He’s good to me, kind, gentle. He reminds me of you, sometimes.”

Still the feelings rose in my throat, tried to choke me, and I fought not to sob. “Mom, I . . . I miss you. There’s a video from our wedding in one of the SD cards, I guess someone had a working camera and thought to record it all. I know we didn’t always get along, but I hope I made you proud. I wouldn’t be who I am if it weren’t for you. I know we’ll see each other again someday, even if not the way you’d want.”

Pain, old and familiar at this point, grew in my chest, a coarse sensation that wanted to stifle me. I couldn’t let it. This was too important. I had to carry on, to finish this.

They had to be told.

*Give me strength, Adonai.*

“I love you both, more than you could ever know.” I squeezed my eyes shut, and my voice cracked as hot salty waves rolled down my cheeks. “I always will. That’s why I wanted to make this recording just for you, because you deserve to know something.”

Across my face came a smile, a real smile, one that burst with the secret whispered to me in the sunlit meadows of Tauerpin Road. “You’re going to be grandparents. I know, it should be too soon to tell, but let’s just say I have it on good authority. I haven’t told Chris yet, I want to surprise him. If it’s a boy, I’d like to name him Rodrick, after Chris’s grandfather. If it’s a girl . . .”

The breeze rustled my hair, sending strands of brown and gold twirling before my eyes. Despite the winter chill, it almost seemed warm, as if from a distant summer memory, and I glanced down at the rifle by my side. While heavier than my old Type 9, the Kalashnikov gleamed under a thin coat of oil, scuffed and scratched, but reliable. Across the ground in front of me, dozens upon dozens of picture frames stood amongst the snow, staked into the ground under the cherry tree with a multitude of smiling faces. They had been copied at the university by one of the few remaining printers, encased in laminate to guard against the weather. Names were painted on the frames under each, and the one closest to me bore a man and a girl with similar facial features. Their bleach-blonde hair played in the sunlight, their uniform shirts boasting ‘New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve’ on the pocket, and tucked into the frame alongside it, was our picture.

*Man, that cake was good, wasn’t it? I never danced so much in my whole life. The dress you got me was so beautiful too . . .*

Laughing as I wept, I let grief mingle with joy until both melded into a torrent of feeling, not painful so much as grateful. Perhaps someday I would grow old so that the places, times, and dates faded into obscurity, but a part of me knew I could never forget the ones who guided me here.

Here, where I was always meant to be.

“If it’s a girl . . .” Resting my gaze on the camera, I let the wind whisper in my ear, the sun warm on my face, and breathed deep the air of my country as it caressed the cherry tree. “. . . I’m going to call her Jamie.”",4,1760621346.0,u_RandomAppalachian468,1,1.0,False

Two weeks ago, my boyfriend met a girl at a work/internship event and asked her out to a coffee date. she looks nothing like me, different races, job, etc in the texts, he called her stunning and apologized for being too forward in person and proceeded to make plans for a coffee date for the next week, which she tried to change to dinner by asking to meet past 7pm and he agreed. he never responded to her final text asking for confirmation of the date and so thus did not proceed with setting up the date. before i saw the message or searched for it, he had deleted it. i found it two weeks later when i was looking through his phone randomly in the deleted section on his imessages and confronted him about it. he has since cried and apologized many times and said he realized his mistake which is why he never went to the date and deleted the messages. Since he is also very religious (catholic, although i am not), he also went to confession for this prior to telling me. I want to believe him. 

but his dad cheated on his mother when they had had kids together, so im afraid it might be smth he picked up on, as his brother also sleeps around. i know he still looks at revealing pictures of other women online- all of women who do not look like me and more like that girl, so im scared he has a type and that im not it. he was talking to his ex until the very day upon which we kissed. he still has all the pictures of him and his exes. we are twenty years old and this is his first internship. im making this on a new account so he doesnt see it, but is there hope for us? we attempted to reconcile things, and tried to fix it with sex, gifts and time together, but im still plagued by insecurity and my self esteem is completely shot. did we go back into the relationship too fast without any repercussions? if so, what  should they be? is it even worth trying at all?

We met at a coffee shop early this year and has been together for 4 months na. Regular ako umoorder at tumatambay dun at the same hour in the morning before going to work kaya kilala ko na ang staff at usually ako lang mag-isa kasi sobrang aga pa kaya napapansin ko agad if there is someone new. Then there he was. Napansin ko na same hour din kami tumatambay dun for 2 weeks until he approached me and we got to know each other.

Let's talk about his personality. He is very masculine. Sa mga nakadate ko na lalake, ibang iba talaga sya. He has this swagger and charisma. He also have this ""laser focus"" whenever he needs things to be done. Tapos his emotions are very well controlled. In stressful situations nakikita ko na he's calm and composed habang ako parang magpapanic na hahaha. His logic is also always ahead of his emotions. Never sya pumatol sa mga nag-aamok ng road-rage kahit sila yung mali at sila pa yung matapang. He's also very kind to other people e.g. people in the food service industry.

Then his skills. He is a VERY SKILLFUL man. As in. He knows how to do so many things. Andaming alam sa computer, he knows how to fix anything na ipaayos ko. He can drive any vehicle. He even knows how to fly a plane and how they work! No wonder my dad liked him so much nung pinakilala ko sya! They can talk for hours kasi nakakasabay talaga yung boyfriend ko. He just knows his way with people and grabe yung situational awareness nya when we are in a public place.

Then here's where I started to get intrigued. He is fluent in Russian and Mandarin. He was in the UK for 10 years kaya naging British/Filipino citizen na sya pero pure Filipino talaga sya. Tapos medyo sketchy din yung Facebook nya kasi 89 lang yung friends nya. Wala syang ibang socmed. He doesn't really share to me his life in the UK or what he did there in the past 10 years. Bagong balik lang nya sa Pilipinas nung nagmeet kami. Tapos eto pa.. HE HAS A SECRET PHONE. Nalaman ko lang when I dropped a coin under the seat of his car tapos ayun, nung sinilip ko may nakatagong phone sa ilalim ng seat. Walang power so I don't really know what's the purpose of that phone. (He wasn't in the car by that time. Naka park yun and binalikan ko lang while in a family gathering.)

He works as a ""business consultant"" btw.. kaya madalas sya mag travel travel.. He's traveling to Russia this November and will be there for 6 weeks daw.

Another thing that's kinda intriguing is despite his age, I am the FIRST GIRL he ever asked out and dated according to him. Like gaano ka ba naging kabusy sa life at ngayon ka lang nagka lovelife hahaha. Pero with that age of him? Parang sobrang dami na nyang alam at experience sa mundo.

OA lang ba talaga ako? Sometimes I can't help but overthink.. Am I with a dangerous person? IS MY LIFE AT RISK??? Until now I don't know what he really did in the UK for the past 10 years... Or if he really is just a ""business consultant"" 😕. I've never known any other man like him.",1,1760620914.0,OALangBaAko,2,1.0,False

I live in Belfast(originally from Turkey).

I’m a software engineer which sounds serious until you see me trying to fix something and breaking it twice first. I like staying curious and somewhat active as well ... cycling, hiking, gaming on PC and Xbox, or ending up in 2 a.m. rabbit holes about things I’ll forget by morning lol , watching videos,reading and thinking are all included in these rabbit holes.   
Sundays I’m usually at the animal shelter, fixing things for them or sneaking a few dog cuddles in and sometimes I get those intrusive thoughts to kidnap a cat lol but never did that. But, sometimes I nick a glass from a pub :D

I’m a mix of dry humour, sarcasm, and actual empathy. I’d rather talk about real stuff than pretend to be cool, I like vulnerability like that. I think a good relationship isn't always adventurous and exciting, sometimes being bored with someone is also included in love. I like people who are kind, self-aware, and can laugh at themselves a bit.

**TSMC first.**  
The world’s largest chipmaker posted a 39 percent jump in quarterly profit, its best ever, and raised its 2025 revenue outlook to the mid-30 percent range. AI demand keeps driving record orders from NVIDIA and Apple, sending TSMC shares to new highs. But not everyone is convinced. Citadel’s Ken Griffin said generative AI still isn’t helping hedge funds find real alpha, sparking fresh questions about whether investors are overpricing the AI trade.

**Then Nestle.**  
The food giant announced plans to cut 16,000 jobs, mostly white-collar roles, over the next two years as part of a major restructuring under its new CEO. Despite stronger-than-expected sales, the company is chasing 3 billion francs in cost savings by 2027 while doubling down on fast-growing products like cold coffee and Gen Z drinks. Investors seemed to approve, with shares slightly higher in early trading.

**And metals.**  
Gold held near record highs around 4,240 dollars an ounce after another year of strong gains. Traders are calling it part of the “debasement trade,” as concerns over government debt, rate cuts, and currency stability drive demand for hard assets.

The setup today: tech is roaring, consumer giants are tightening up, and gold remains the quiet winner for risk-averse investors.",1,1760620760.0,OptionsLab,1,1.0,False

The issue with this is 1, I don't want to invite her to someone that'll just be too taxing for her. Since I want to talk about life and stuff, yet I don't know enough ASL for a complex conversation like this, it would have to be a spoken conversation for the most part, which might be too taxing for her.

I see her alot around campus, we have similar makes so I'll see her in the buildings classes are in and we day help and chat for a little bit when we see each other.

Most people don’t see them, not because they can’t, but because the system is structured to be invisible. It’s not about morality or ideology — just how things function, how hierarchies emerge, and how power concentrates over time.

The system feels both artificial and natural. Some people live closer to what our bodies evolved for — clean food, land, sun, freedom — while most live in restriction, artificial environments, and processed food. Resources and control almost perfectly mirror natural hierarchies. Even randomness feeds into it, yet patterns emerge so clearly it’s hard to see them as purely accidental.

Almost everything people strive for loops back to natural needs: sunlight, whole food, seasonal rhythms, space, autonomy. Control isn’t inherently good or bad — it seems to be the mechanism keeping order in place, whether anyone notices it or not.

The same patterns show up everywhere, not just in hierarchy. You can map them onto religion, social movements, institutions, or even cultural trends — almost any human system reflects the same self-organizing logic, and it works repeatedly across different contexts.

It’s just a thought I’ve been working through — an observation of what happens when society, biology, and human behavior intersect.

I read through reddit beforehand, and everyone and their mother recommended a bottomless portafilter, and in Hendrick's video, he depressurizes the portafilter it comes with, so I did that. Then I grinded my beans (medium, grocery store brand), made my first shot, and I stopped when it became a weak drip drip drip. And it tasted like unwashed ass. 

So I tossed out the cup, and tried again, but this time, putting the portafilter back to original mode, and it's pretty darn good. Not my best cup of coffee (moka pot is still reigning champion), but acceptable.

 I think my issue the second time was I was not expecting the level of water flow (the first time had very little flow by comparison, and got weaker over time), and I did not turn off the machine fast enough. It would have kept going making bubbly, white prettiness, overflowing my 12 oz cup 😅 

Can someone please explain what's going on? I have a bottomless portafilter coming in the mail, and I'm thinking about returning it, because maybe I just prefer the one it comes with better. But -- why? What's going on? Why does there seem to be a preference for bottomless? How do I make this better? Anyone else like the portafilter it comes with?",0,1760620519.0,espresso,7,0.33,False

Hello ,
Thank you so much for checking in!
Canada is our home - always has been, always will be. From a garage startup in the Rockies to a team of more than 140 Canadian employees; roasting and packaging our kickass coffee. We work in, live in and give back to Canada.
Yes, we are now owned by Lavazza - an Italian coffee company - but our roots run deep from the Canadian Rockies through to the shores of Newfoundland. We are proud to wake up every day and kick ass, for Canada, in Canada...and that will never change.
Wishing you all good things,
Cheers!

Then I emailed them again just to make sure and asked if they plan in the future to move any production to the states in which they emailed this back to me.

Hello ,
Thank you for following up!
No, we do not, that is I assure you!

My new strategy is to make a list of '5-minute accomplishments' - simple things like replying to a few Slack messages, tidying up my desktop, or making a quick phone call. That way, when my main plan gets derailed, I can at least knock out a few of these tasks and feel like I've accomplished something, instead of feeling like the day was a total waste. It also helps me to take a quick break, grab a coffee, and walk around the apartment for a minute to reset.

Ended up grabbing a Finca el Puente geisha from Honduras, one that i had earlier this year and love, haven’t really had any trouble with it. I also grabbed a washed Tatmara Ethiopian, which I tried at his café last year but never brewed myself. 

Been brewing both of them in my new Kalita Mino-Yaki brewer, and was having great results for the geisha with my usual recipe. The Ethiopian however, ended up kinda dull and underwhelming. The recipe I was using was 13g coffee to 200g water, bloom + three pours aiming for a drawdown at 2:30-3:00 ish. I thought that maybe this coffee just didn’t have what I like in Ethiopians, and it’s doing a more subtle approach.

Today I decided to spice things up a bit and tried a more active recipe with 30g pours every 30 seconds. What I did was a 30g bloom, then up to 60, up to 90, up to 120, up to 150, and then finishing it up to 200. So bloom + five pours. After this I ended up with a drawdown at over four minutes, and was convinced it’d be overextracted and unpleasant. When I tasted it, however, I was immediately blown away and started kinda laughing to myself like a little freak. It tasted amazing, super floral and citrusy, exactly what I want from a washed Ethiopian. Just did it again to confirm that it wasn’t a one-off, and it’s amazing now too. Just proves that different beans can require different brew methods, but I really didn’t think it would make this big of a difference.",15,1760619889.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1o85jub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Japaneselanguage/comments/1o85jub/the_ai_prompt_that_lets_your_hobbies_remember/,The AI Prompt That Lets Your Hobbies Remember Japanese for You,"I always believe that if we want to remember things quickly, we need to connect new knowledge to our existing memories. Existing memories are like fertile soil—they nourish new ideas, helping them take root and grow easily.

Our memories shape who we are, and they take many forms. In this article, I want to explore one specific form: **our hobbies**. Think of it like signing up for a news app—it asks what topics interest you, then customizes your feed accordingly. Because every article matches your interests, you stay engaged much longer. Language learning can work the same way.

Hobbies are not just what we do for fun — they are **emotional gateways to memory**. When we learn something that connects to what we already love, our brains light up. Emotion strengthens memory, and familiarity provides context. That’s why a word related to your passion — whether it’s coffee, photography, or coding — sticks faster than one that feels distant. In short, hobbies aren’t just interests; they’re **shortcuts to remembering**.

So how can we connect our hobbies to Japanese vocabulary?

The traditional way is to immerse yourself in real Japanese environments: watching anime, listening to J-pop, reading manga, or joining Reddit communities about your interests. But with AI, you can now create that personalized immersion instantly—with just a prompt.

Here’s an example of one that works beautifully:

> You are a native Japanese speaker, a creative language teacher, and [Your name]’s close Japanese friend who deeply understands his life.**
> 
> 
> **You know he lives in [Your city], loves [Your hobbies]; he’s studying Japanese and enjoys natural, emotional expressions.**
> 
> **Generate 10–15 natural Japanese example sentences for the given word.**
> 
> **Each sentence should reflect his life and interests**
> 
> **Each example includes two lines:**
> 
> 1. Japanese sentence
> 2. English translation
> 
> Make all sentences natural, realistic, and emotionally resonant — like real moments from [Your Name]’s life.
> 

This prompt is designed to make AI generate **personalized Japanese example sentences** that feel emotionally and contextually connected to *you*.

And this is my Prompt

> You are a native Japanese speaker, a creative language teacher, and Harry’s close Japanese friend who deeply understands his life.
> 
> 
> **You know he lives in Tokyo, loves coffee, photography, coding, and AI; he’s studying Japanese and enjoys natural, emotional expressions.**
> 
> **Generate 10–15 natural Japanese example sentences for the given word.**
> 
> **Each sentence should reflect his life and interests**
> 
> **Each example includes two lines:**
> 
> 1. Japanese sentence
> 2. English translation
> 
> Make all sentences natural, realistic, and emotionally resonant — like real moments from Harry’s life.
> 

Here are a few examples generated for the word **乱れる (みだれる)**:

1. 髪が風で乱れてしまったけど、そのままの方が自然で好きだ。
    
    *My hair got messy in the wind, but I actually like it that way—it feels natural.*
    
2. 心が乱れているときは、コーヒーを淹れて深呼吸するようにしている。
    
    *When my mind feels unsettled, I make coffee and take a deep breath.*
    
3. 雨の中で撮った写真は、光が乱れて幻想的だった。
    
    *The photos I took in the rain had scattered light that looked almost magical.*
    
4. 猫が夜中に走り回って、寝るリズムがすっかり乱れた。
    
    *The cat ran around at night and completely messed up my sleep rhythm.*
    
5. 桜の花びらが風に乱れる様子は、どこか儚くて美しい。
    
    *The sight of cherry blossoms scattered by the wind is fleetingly beautiful.*
    
6. AIの返答が遅れると、ちょっと気持ちが乱れる。
    
    When the AI’s response is delayed, it makes me a bit uneasy.
    
7. 長く座ってコードを書いていると、姿勢が乱れて体が固くなる。
    
    When I sit coding too long, my posture slips and my body stiffens.
    
8. 試験の前は、いつも心拍が少し乱れる。
    
    Before an exam, my heartbeat always gets a little irregular.
    

The results were incredible. Every sentence felt personal, like a note from an old friend.
Each sentence is not just an example—it’s a **memory anchor**. When I think of “乱れる” now, I don’t recall a dictionary definition; I recall my cat, coffee, the wind in Tokyo, and a photo I once took in the rain.
And don’t forget—AI like ChatGPT has its own memory, too. That memory is like a fragment of your own, reflecting pieces of who you are ——— This makes each example relatable and easy to recall.

That’s the magic of connecting language learning with who you are.

By making AI part of your memory ecosystem, you can turn every new word into a familiar friend.

So....Next time you learn a new word, let AI write your life into it.”

Hey everyone,

If your idea of ""high-stakes gameplay"" is trying to finish a cargo run before you hear footsteps coming down the hall, then you might be in the right place.

We're a small but growing community of gamers, mostly dads, who love Star Citizen but have accepted that our reaction times have been nerfed by sleep deprivation. We've built a casual, no-pressure environment for people who have jobs, families, and other real-life commitments that always take priority.

**Who are we?**

We're an organization and Discord community built on the simple principle that gaming should be a relaxing escape, not another source of stress. We get that you might have to go AFK with zero notice because a kid is awake, the dog just threw up, or your spouse is giving you *the look*. No one will ever give you grief for it here.

**What we do in Star Citizen:**

* **Everything, slowly:** Industrial runs (mining/salvage), bounty hunting, bunkers, exploration, and the occasional ""let's see if we can land three Rocs in a C2 without everything exploding"" shenanigans.
* **Helping New Players:** The 'verse is confusing. We're happy to show you the ropes without any pressure.
* **Group Events (that are 100% optional):** We'll try to get together for things like Jumptown or Xenothreat when it aligns with our schedules, but there are no mandatory ops. Ever.

**Who we're looking for:**

You're probably a great fit if:

* You're a parent or just someone with a busy adult life.
* Your prime gaming hours are late in the evening.
* You want a chill, mature group to hang out with and talk about games, dad jokes, and whatever else comes up.
* You're looking for a group that values teamwork and fun over hardcore min/maxing.

Our Discord server is active for Star Citizen, but we play other games too. It's become a solid place for like-minded people to just connect and decompress.

**Requirements:**

* Be a decent human being. No drama, no toxicity.
* Have a mic for comms.
* Patience. Both for the game and for your fellow org mates who might have just spilled coffee on their keyboard.

If this sounds like your speed, come say hello in our Discord and see if it's a good fit.

[**https://discord.gg/EZnjewZHSF**](https://discord.gg/EZnjewZHSF)

See you in the 'verse (probably after a nap).

My friends and family have been pestering me to put it out there. So doing it in a way that feels honest and right to me 🙈

Soft-launching my first product: The Diwali Brownie Box - 6 mini brownies and blondies, made fresh at home!

Hopefully your orders and kind words will keep pushing me to create more and find myself again :) Happy Diwali - here’s to new beginnings. 🪔

1o85dil,https://www.reddit.com/r/greenville/comments/1o85dil/sharing_my_highlands_cashiers_fall_itinerary_2/,Sharing my Highlands & Cashiers fall itinerary — 2 hrs from GVL + peak fall colors,"Hey ya'll, I’m the editor of *Out of Office GVL*, a free local newsletter that shares ready-to-go weekend plans and day trips from Greenville every Thursday.

This week’s plan was a fall escape to **Highlands & Cashiers, NC,** timed perfectly for peak leaf color 🍁. You can do it as a full weekend or just a one-day trip. I thought I’d share the full itinerary here after feedback from this sub. 
  
**🍂 Highlands & Cashiers Autumn Escape from Greenville**

**Distance/Drive from Greenville:** 2–2.5 hours  
**Vibe:** Seasonal + Scenic Exploring  
**Activity Level:** Easy to Moderate (optional short hikes)  
**Kid/Pet-Friendly:** Yes to both (most trails are pet-friendly)  
**Reservations:** Recommended if staying overnight

**Choose-your-own-adventure:** make it a full weekend escape or pick 2–3 highlights for a perfect fall day trip.

# 🌄 Day 1: Waterfalls, Small Towns & Scenic Drives

**8:00 AM — Depart Greenville**  
Drive up to [**Whitewater Falls**]() (about 2 hrs). One of the tallest in the East — the paved path leads to a sweeping overlook.  
Looking for more of a workout? Add a short segment of the [**Foothills Trail**]().

**11:30 AM — Cashiers Exploration**  
Brunch or early lunch at [**Cornucopia Restaurant**]() — cozy cottage porch dining with excellent sandwiches. *(Closed Sundays)*  
Walk off lunch through [**The Village Green**]() to see fall colors, gardens, and local art.

**1:30 PM — Scenic Drive to Highlands (30 min)**  
This stretch along **US 64** is pure autumn magic. Pull over for:

* [**Dry Falls**]() — you can walk *behind* the waterfall.
* [**Bridal Veil Falls**]() — a quick roadside stop you can drive under.

# 🌆 Evening Options

 **Day Trip Return:**  
Early dinner in Highlands at [**Madison’s at Old Edwards Inn**]() (cozy upscale) or [**The Ruffed Grouse Tavern**]() (set in the Highlander Mountain House) before heading back to Greenville to sleep in your own bed.

**Overnight Stay:**

>

🏡 [**Highlander Mountain House**]() – stylish and warm, with its own acclaimed tavern  
🌲 [**The Wells Hotel**]() – cozy yet walkable to Cashiers’ main street  
🌿 [**The Park on Main**]() – dog-friendly boutique hotel in Highlands

# ☀️ Day 2: Slow Morning & Scenic Return

Start slow with coffee and pastries at [**Calder’s Coffee Café**]() or [**Mountain Fresh Grocery**]() (both in Highlands).

Then lace up for [**Glen Falls**]() — a 2.5-mile roundtrip waterfall hike about 10 minutes from town.

# Optional Scenic Stop & Route

If you’re looping back through Sapphire or Lake Toxaway, stop for lakeside dining at [**The Greystone Inn**]().

Extra time? Take the [**Blue Ridge Parkway via Pisgah Forest**]() for a leisurely leaf-peeping finale before heading home (adds \~1 hr to your drive).

# Prep in 60 Seconds

**What to bring:** Layers — mornings are crisp at elevation. Toss in a rain jacket and umbrella just in case.  
**Book ahead:** October weekends fill up fast for overnight stays (Airbnb is an option).  
**Pro tip:** Save offline maps; service fades on backroads ([how-to]()).

# Plan B: Highlands in the Rain 

If the weather doesn’t cooperate, swap the hikes for a cozy mountain day.  
Stroll the boutique shops on [**Main Street**](), linger over coffee at [**Calder’s Coffee Café**]() or [**Blue Bike Café**]() *(closed Sundays)*, and tuck into a long lunch at [**The Ruffed Grouse Tavern**]() before heading home relaxed and well-fed.

He pushed through the inn's heavy doors and walked straight into a scene of chaos.

Bodies packed the common room shoulder to shoulder. Every table groaned under the load of food and drink. The air itself felt solid—a mixture of woodsmoke, spilled ale, and too many people crammed into too small a space. A bard in the corner attacked a lute with more enthusiasm than skill, adding another layer to the racket.

Caleb's eyes swept the room, searching for Cassia. He spotted her near the kitchen doorway, directing a harried server with sharp gestures. The young woman nodded frantically before diving back into the crowd with a laden tray.

He cut through the press of bodies, dodging elbows and stepping around a puddle of something he didn't want to identify. ""Cassia. I need a word. It's urgent.""

She turned, the corners of her mouth tightening. ""Not now, Thal. The mayor—"" Her words died as she took in his expression. Something in his face made her grab his arm and pull him into the cramped alcove beside her office door.

""This had better be important."" Her voice was a low command, each word clipped and sharp. ""Mayor Aldric is here with half his court, and we're already down a server.""

He met her eyes, his features settling into a neutral mask. ""I need to get stronger. I'm joining Captain Hatch's training tomorrow morning.""

Cassia looked confused. ""Well, of course you are dear.""

Caleb blinked. ""What do you mean?""

She glanced toward the common room, then leaned closer. Her voice fell to a hushed murmur. ""The Dominion Youth Preparedness Mandate. Every citizen must report for martial training upon Awakening.""

Cassia's words unlocked the memory. A fragment of Thal’s past surfaced: the dread of his approaching sixteenth birthday, the weight of the Mandate a constant pressure.

""Obviously, you couldn't have mustered for training this morning because you just Awakened this afternoon. But be warned: it's not what they tell you it is,"" Cassia continued, her words coming faster now. ""Oh, they dress it up with pretty language about civic duty and public defense. But it's a scouting program, pure and simple. They find the best—"" Her lips twisted. ""—and they take the rest.""

The pieces snapped together. Talent acquisition on a planetary scale. The promising ones got fast-tracked to power, while the rest became cannon fodder. *The Imperial Unpaid Internship Program,* Caleb thought with grim humor. *Where the final interview might involve a sword.*

""Captain Arion Hatch runs the local program. He's tough but fair."" Her expression softened for just a moment. ""Arion will be glad to have you.""

The name—while known—meant little to him, but he noted that he seemed to have a relationship with the Hearthsongs. Before he could ask, Cassia's touch settled on his shoulder, her fingers digging in with surprising strength.

""And Corinne will be glad for the company. Look after her.""

The quiet command hung in the air, absolute and unyielding. Caleb gave a single, crisp nod.

""Now go."" She pushed him toward the kitchen. ""Gareth needs you.""

The door into the kitchen opened wide, and the usual deluge of heat rolled out.

""Finally!"" Gareth's voice cut through the noise. ""Prep station. Now.""

With a dip of his chin, Caleb moved through the kitchen. The path to his station felt a hundred feet long. He felt eyes on his back, prickling his skin, saw hushed words falter as he turned his head. Cooks who had offered him tired smiles yesterday now gave him a wide berth, their expressions a mixture of suspicion and annoyance.

Right. His cheerful exit. Heat flooded his cheeks. He remembered the whole mortifying scene. They wouldn't know about any potion. They just saw an unreliable kid who cracked under pressure and walked out. He deserved the cold shoulder.

*Only one way to fix this,* he thought, his grip closing around the handle of his knife. *Work. Be useful. Be too valuable to hate.*

Caleb found his knife with purpose now. A mountain of vegetables waited—onions, carrots, celery. The knife became an extension of his will. His consciousness narrowed to the blade, the board, and the rhythm. Around him, the kitchen crew moved in their own dance—servers swooping in to grab plates, Gareth orchestrating everything with barked commands and pointed gestures.

""Behind!"" A server carrying hot soup brushed past.

""Two more steaks on the fly!"" Another voice called out.

""Where's my bloody garnish?"" Gareth roared.

Caleb's motions never ceased. When the vegetable mountain dwindled, more appeared. He shifted to slicing meat, each motion a composite of observations. The way one cook used his knuckles to guide the blade, the wrist-flick another used to debone a fish—**\[Perfect Memory\]** supplied the data, and his body executed the optimized result.

The kitchen door burst open, and Corinne swept in with her tray of golden juice, earning grateful nods from the exhausted staff.

When she reached Caleb's corner, her entire demeanor changed. Her feet never settled, dancing from toe to toe as she pressed the glass into him. A grin stretched so wide it seemed to pull at the corners of her eyes.

""Mom told me and I can't believe it, you're joining me tomorrow, finally!"" The words tumbled out in an excited jumble, a single breathless rush. ""We start at dawn and Captain Hatch doesn't tolerate tardiness, not for a second, but don't worry, I'll make sure you're ready.""

Before he could respond, she was already moving away, called by another cook. But she glanced back once, that brilliant smile still in place, and mouthed the word ""tomorrow"" with unmistakable enthusiasm.

A cook nearby—one who'd been scowling at him before—caught the interaction. He met Caleb's eye for a moment before giving a brief, barely visible dip of his head.

Caleb refocused on his task, putting off thoughts of training. Time dissolved into the rhythm of the work. His arms burned with the continuous motion. Sweat plastered the rough apron to his skin, but he couldn't stop. The kitchen was a living thing, and he was a part of it.

Hours passed in what felt like minutes. Gradually, imperceptibly, the pace slowed. Orders trickled rather than flooded. The roar from the common room faded to a murmur. Servers leaned against walls instead of sprinting between tables.

Caleb set down his knife and flexed his fingers. They were stiff, locked in the shape of the handle. His back screamed when he straightened. Every muscle from his shoulders to his wrists throbbed in time with his heartbeat.

Without a word, Gareth ladled thick stew into a bowl and set it before him. The smell alone was enough to make Caleb's stomach rumbled with hunger. He hadn't realized how empty he was until food appeared.

He ate without thought, too tired for his usual analysis of flavors and technique. The stew was fuel, nothing more. Around him, the kitchen staff moved with the slow, deliberate motions of the utterly exhausted. Someone laughed—a weary, punch-drunk sound. Someone else cursed as they dropped a pan.

Gareth appeared again, shoving a paper-wrapped bundle in front of Caleb. The grease had already soaked through, leaving translucent spots.

""For the morning."" The half-elf's voice was gruff. ""You're no good to me if you collapse.""

Caleb looked up, meeting those green eyes. Behind the practical concern, he saw a flicker of respect. Gareth stared for a long moment.

""I heard you spoke with Cassia."" The words came slowly, each one deliberate. ""Corinne is strong, but she is still my daughter. Do not be a burden to her.""

The word was a gut punch. *Daughter*. Instantly, Katie’s face filled his vision—flushed with panic, tearing through the house for her green jacket. *Dad, have you seen it?* The memory was so complete he could smell her strawberry shampoo.

He swallowed hard and met Gareth's intense stare. The universal language of fatherhood transcended worlds. This man would kill for his daughter. Just like Caleb would for his own.

""I'll protect her like she's my own..."" The word caught in his throat. *Daughter.* ""...sister.""

Gareth studied him for another heartbeat, then nodded once. The matter was settled. He turned back to his domain, already focused on tomorrow's prep.

Caleb resumed cleaning, moving through the routine motions of scrubbing and sanitizing. His body operated on autopilot while his mind spun through the evening's revelations. The Mandate. Forced conscription. Corinne needing protection. A world where children trained for war as a matter of course.

""I'm so excited!""

He looked up to find Corinne hurrying into the kitchen. Her face was smudged with soot from tending the common room's fireplace, her hair escaping from its usual ponytail. But her bright expression lit up the grimy corner of the kitchen, a flash of pure, unforced delight that seemed to cut through the oppressive heat and weariness.

""It'll be so much better now!"" She practically bounced despite the late hour. ""Captain Hatch always partners me with Mala, and she smells like pickled fish. You'll be my partner now!""

A hot, prickling sensation crawled up his neck. *She's sixteen. I'm old enough to be her father.* The realization was jarring. *This is like Katie's friend asking me to be her lab partner.* He forced his face into what he hoped was a friendly smile.

""Looking forward to it,"" he managed.

""Dawn training is rough at first,"" she continued, oblivious to his discomfort. ""But you get used to it. And Captain Hatch really knows his stuff. He was in the Legions for twenty years before he retired here.""

Twenty years. Caleb mentally cataloged the detail. A career soldier running a youth program.

""I should..."" He gestured vaguely at the pile of pots still waiting.

""Oh! Right. Sorry."" She flashed another smile. ""See you in the morning!""

She disappeared back into the common room, leaving Caleb alone with his thoughts and the dishes. He worked mechanically, moving while his mind processed. By the time he finished, the kitchen was silent except for the tick of cooling metal and the distant murmur of the few remaining patrons.

His cot had never looked more inviting. Caleb collapsed onto it fully clothed, not bothering to remove even his boots. Every muscle screamed in protest as he settled onto the thin mattress. The ache of a hard day's work, multiplied by the intensity of the dinner rush.

He stared at the dark ceiling overhead. Corinne was excited. To her, this was just the next step. Like getting a driver's license or going to a new school. For him, it was something else entirely. *Military training.* The words sounded wrong in his mind. The closest he’d ever come was a paintball game for a team-building exercise. He’d gotten a welt on his arm and complained about it for a week.

Tomorrow, a Legion veteran would teach him how to use a real weapon for its true purpose: ending a life.

His mind jumped to Selara's challenge. *Kill a feral goblin.* He imagined it. A small, hunched creature with sharp teeth. He would have to walk up to it and… what? Stab it? Carving a Thanksgiving turkey was the extent of his experience. Driving a blade into something that could bleed and scream and fight back was an act for which he had no frame of reference. The thought left a sour taste in his mouth. He remembered Cillian in the alley, the casual way he used his knife. That was the skill he needed to learn.

Sleep took him between one breath and the next.

He woke to darkness and the absence of pain.

No. Not absence. The pain was still there, a heavy blanket of soreness draped over his entire body. And something else had changed. He felt… lighter somehow. A soft chime rang in his mind, followed by silver text appearing in his vision.

**\[Spiritual Contamination has decreased by 1.00% -> 9.00%\]**

Progress. It was something. One percent gone after a single night. Nine more days to get back to zero. But what exactly was he getting rid of? Spiritual Contamination. The name was unpleasant, but the system offered no details. *What happens if I just ignore it? If I use another stone, does the number just go up? What's the penalty?* He had no answers, only a new list of questions.

He shook his head. Dwelling on it wouldn't provide a single answer. It was just another unknown variable in an equation he couldn't solve. For now, it was a problem for future Caleb. Present Caleb had a more immediate and pressing concern: surviving the pre-dawn hours without a single drop of caffeine. The idea was so woefully depressing it almost overshadowed the lingering ache in his muscles.

*Crumb. It's not even five. My old life had its problems, but at least it had Colombian dark roast. I'd pay ten silver for a pot of coffee right now.*

He forced himself upright, muscles protesting every movement. The paper-wrapped sausage sat on the small table beside his cot, grease now congealed but still fragrant. He unwrapped it and took a bite. Dense, fatty, and surprisingly warm—some kind of warming enchantment in the paper, maybe. The dense meal sank like lead shot, radiating steady warmth through his insides.

With a grunt, he swung his legs from the cot, ignoring the protest of every muscle in his body. It was a good ache. The ache of effort. The ache of progress.

He had promises to keep and a goblin to kill.

It all started today.

1o85958,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalWrites/comments/1o85958/the_liminal_night/,The Liminal Night,"It was a very hot day. It's the worst season of all. The sun still stood high and mighty. It was five o'clock. The walk to my apartment wasn't pleasant the slightest because I knew my room was also filled with hot air. The moment I opened the door, a husk of hot air blew past me. I hoped that it could get a slightly less hotter as time passes.


It was a wearisome day and I was at the end of my wits. I didn't even have the energy to shower. I washed my hands and feet. Lied on the ground and played a YouTube video on my laptop. I was a bit hungry but I didn't want to stand up and prepare any food on this very hot day. I just wanted to lie under the fan and do nothing.


I woke up to the sound of some troglodyte honking like someone's life depended on it. When I checked the time it was 11:54 PM. Yes, I slept  for almost seven hours. My laptop was still on and YouTube was still playing. Now I thought maybe someone's life did depend on honking if it was this late. My head felt heavy and my body felt dehydrated. I took a shower first. 


Although I was hungry, There wasn't anything to prepare. I found  a packet of noodles and that's all I needed. There were some eggs. And I ended that with black coffee. It's 1 AM now. The night is hauntingly silent. The room now feels colder. I went to the balcony for a while. The cold and quiet air carried a sense of relief while the stars hid behind the clouds. But the moon still shone as bright as ever. I wanted to write something, maybe a poem to keep this memory in this time. I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep at all. So I decided to go for a walk. 


It was 2:30 when I left my apartment. The streets were empty and carried an air of fullness. It was like the streets weren't empty at all. I walked through the alleys looking in a similar manner as I did before but there was a subtle change. I had seen these alleys empty before but it wasn't the empty that I was looking at right now. Even the trees in people's backyard looked different. They seem more awake than they seemed during the day. Before I knew it I had reached a playground. I didn't carry my phone or my watch. I didn't know the exact time. 


The empty ground looked beautiful. The soft green grass felt cold to touch. The empty benches seemed to be watching over the ground. I sat on one of the benches. The cold air didn't feel cold anymore. It felt a bit warm. And like I did before, I had dozed off again. When I heard a group of people talking I woke up in a panic. I saw a group of people walking on the ground. The sun was at the horizon as red as it could be. And before I knew it, my night had ended. ",1,1760618944.0,NepalWrites,0,1.0,False

It’s called Firefly, and it’s basically a bugging platform… not the annoying kind, but the intentional kind. Think of it as a way to inject, track, and study bugs across apps, APIs, and systems in real time… very much an alpha, as I’m speaking to the vision here. 

I built it because debugging tools always feel reactive, you fix the problem after it happens. Firefly flips that idea. It creates controlled chaos on purpose, so you can see where things break before they actually do.

Right now it can detect a host of  weird edge cases that usually only appear in production at 3 a.m. (when your coffee’s cold and your soul leaves your body).

Still ironing out the dashboard UI and deciding if I should open-source the base framework or keep it private for paid enterprise tiers. There’s also an internal “heat map” view I’m obsessed with, it visualizes system stress in real time, and when it lights up, it literally looks like glowing fireflies across your code.

Feedback, ideas, and even brutal honesty are welcome, I’m still shaping what this becomes.

1o856xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/MythofEmpires/comments/1o856xe/whats_meaning_of_human_life/,what's meaning of human life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

56y Gleason 3+4 165lb 5’10” decent shape. Walking 10k steps a day before. Had heart aneurysm and valve reconstruction July 9! Very lucky to have caught that via my pre op work for prostatectomy . So 2025 has been something. I am very grateful to have caught everything and for modern medicine. 

Smooth operation yesterday 7:30am -10:30 

First few hours groggy and bladder spasms.  They gave me oxybutin which did not help too much. Pain level 5. 

Napped for an hour @3pm and woke up and spasms subsided. I was so happy I just lied there in relaxation and no pain. 

Very small appetite but got fruit parties and some scrambled eggs down. Surprisingly good food. 

Wife w me the whole time bless her heart. I know she was scared and also had my back with the crazy heart surgery (5days hospital) 

Spent one night in the hospital just out of precaution due to the heart operation. Slept OK. Woken multiple times for vitals, etc.

I brought eye shades, and earplugs, as there are many lights coming on and off and sounds which really helped. Highly recommend.

i woke  to my surgeon’s assistant and gave him my report. much improved after that night and they discharged me around 11 AM.

Gas pain in abdomen very pronounced. Hard to take full breath.  Manage to navigate into my house and recovery room(guest room) and set up all my stuff. Jeez. I made a spreadsheet to track when to take meds etc. 

Last night slept better. Woke up twice. Odd feeling not having to get up to pee. Filled half the large bag. I use the hanger trick to hang my bag between the boxspring and mattress. I switched to the leg bag this morning not a great scenario switching but at least I can go for walks and be more mobile without carrying the large bag.

I cut back on coffee and switch to tea a week before the surgery. I did have some tea this morning, which helped get things moving and had my first bowel movement. Still not a huge appetite, but will continue to drink water, walk, nap, and know that I will steadily improve.

Thanks again to this group for sharing and I hope my story helps someone out there.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

With that done, I can finally post the story that I presented to them. 

It’s not often that you come across a ghost story in primary records. Most are commonly just re-told through subsequent generations, and the tales continue to pass from one child to the next as the years roll on. 

But the following story is not one that I have heard before. Then on top of that, it comes straight from a primary source. Then on top of that, that primary source was an officer of the Texas Navy during the Texas Revolution! 

Without further ado, I present to you all: 

THE “GHOST-SEER”: A TRUE STORY OF THE TEXAS NAVY, 1836

For generations, maritimers have told stories of mythical beasts, ghostly apparitions, strange aerial lights, and other odd phenomena of the dark depths of the sea. Most of these legends have little factual context to support them, but there are some that are indeed straight from the historical record. Such is the case with the following tale.

S.W. Cushing, a low ranking officer onboard the Texas battleship Liberty, was an individual who did not share the superstitious nature of his fellow crewmen. But on the night of March 5, 1836, Cushing and many others with him received the jolt of their lives. 

It was only an hour or so following the Liberty’s capture of the Mexican supply ship, Pelicano. In the darkening distance, the shadowy hills of the Yucatán Peninsula were gradually losing their tropical colors as the sun sank below the horizon. 

Among the crew going onboard the Pelicano was a young man from Liverpool, England. His name was John, and just for clarity’s sake, we’ll say that his surname was Drayman because that’s the position John served onboard the Liberty.

Somehow, John Drayman had ended up in New Orleans around the time that the Texas Navy was being organized. He and a friend volunteered for enlistment, but for some inexplicable reason, John’s companion hanged himself in the duo’s living quarters before entering service. 

The man’s death had a profound impact on John’s mentality. From the moment the Englishman came aboard the Liberty, John was plagued by terrifying visions that only he could see. 

Describing John Drayman in 1857, Cushing relates: 

“Often in broad daylight he would [stare]…eyes fixed, upon vacancy, his whole frame shivering with mortal fear, his features a deathly hue, and so completely unnerved as to be deprived of the least power to help himself.” (Cushing, 165.) 

When finally brought back to reality, John would claim that he was being haunted by the spirit of his dead companion. Naturally, in a crew composed of superstitious followers, John was quickly labeled as a “ghost-seer.” 

As time wore on, the crewmen onboard the Liberty gradually got used to John’s sudden trances. But, these ruffians of the sea were not wholly comfortable having a haunted man sharing their quarters. 

To ease their own nerves, anytime the “ghost-seer” would begin drifting into one of his spells, the Englishman would immediately be drenched in buckets of water or physically waylaid. It seemed to be the only remedy. 

On the evening of March 5, and maybe under the glow of a moon, John Drayman the “ghost-seer” was moving crates of cargo onto the Liberty. In charge of the matter was a certain Mr. Mayo, who was nervous that John might suddenly be hit by a haunt and either drop himself or a piece of plunder into the water.

To prevent losing either subject, Mr. Mayo decided to task John with something not as important. He directed the young Englishman to get a pot of coffee brewing in the galley for the crew. A simple matter that he believed the “ghost-seer” could handle. 

John did just that. He went into the kitchen, started up a stove and began the brewing process. But after just a few minutes, as S.W. Cushing relates: 

“Quick as a flash, the figure of our newly installed cocinero bolted from the galley, his hair standing on end, and, with a loud shriek, measured his length upon the deck.” (Cushing, 166.) 

The Englishman shoved his way through a crowd of companions, rushing headlong for the opposite side of the deck with the purest expression of terror he had ever displayed! Aggravated, Mr. Mayo cursed the poor man to scorn, and ordered someone into the galley to see after the coffee and fire. 

Rushing into the darkened room, a brute of a sailor named Letcher dashed boldly inside. But just as quickly, turned about, and came rushing back onto the deck like a frightened bull in a thunderstorm. (Ibid.) 

Over the silence of the midnight ocean, Letcher proclaimed that there was in-fact someone inside the kitchen, but not a person of flesh and blood. He had heard a wailing moan in the galley, one certainly of a man, but the room was wholly empty! 

Bewildered, Mr. Mayo ordered the whole group into the galley. But not one of them dared to step even a toe closer. 

As Cushing puts it: 

“The dare-devils who had…rushed at the points of the bayonets leveled at them by the enemy, now fell back from the galley with as much precipitation as if it had contained a mine of gunpowder about to be fired.” (Ibid.) 

Mr. Mayo accosted the crowd with every manner of terminology available for cowardice. He demanded they get in there and save the coffee, but to his dismay, only one of the sailors was bold enough to reply. 

In a quivering, defiant, manner; John Drayman told Mr. Mayo to go and investigate the galley himself. Accepting the challenge, Mr. Mayo, with Cushing beside him, entered the darkened kitchen. 

Cushing, frightfully says: 

“At the same moment a most unearthly groan saluted our astonished ears.” (Ibid.) 

The voice echoed loudly off the galley walls. For a quick heartbeat, Cushing and Mayo were somewhat aghast, but stood resolute to investigate. Calming their minds, the two discovered that the source was emitting from behind the stove. 

Searching the spot, a hidden compartment near the base of the stove was uncovered. It was hardly large enough for a child to fit into, but when they removed the exterior covering, they were shocked to find a most grateful individual. 

As Cushing says: 

“The poor fellow was almost dead, between fear and burning, and so much exhausted as to be utterly incapable of extracting himself, and he could not be released without getting burnt still more…” (Cushing, 167.) 

The small framed individual, as the crew would learn, was the cook for the captured Pelicano. When the Texian sailors had ambushed the vessel, he had quickly concealed himself in the painfully cramped, hidden, compartment behind the stove.

For over two hours the frightened cook had remained in his hideaway. He admitted that he had no idea who the attackers were, and believed it to be pirates. Unarmed, the man was afraid of being murdered and decided to stay hidden until he could figure out how to escape. 

Talking with the cook further, it was revealed that he was an Italian by birth and an ardent Federalist. He had no loyalty to Santa Anna’s centralization of the Mexican government, but was already in the Mexican Navy when the Constitution of 1824 was abolished. 

In need of his profession, the captain and crew of the Liberty offered him the same role with the Texas Navy. The individual wholeheartedly accepted the invitation, and stayed with the Liberty for the rest of the war. (Cushing, 167.) 

Unfortunately, it was not such a happy ending for John “the ghost-seer” Drayman. Somewhere between Pass Cavallo and Matagorda, as Cushing relates, the Englishman was repairing a rope that had come undo when he was once again struck with a terrifying vision of his friend’s apparition. 

“Throwing up his arms,” as Cushing writes, “…[John] shouted ‘He is coming!’ and at the instant fell from the boom, the water receiving and closing over him forever.” (Cushing, 171.) 

That was the last documented time anyone ever saw poor John Drayman. Perhaps he survived and was able to swim ashore? Lived quietly on a remote corner of Matagorda Bay somewhere? Truthfully, history will never know. But the story of the “ghost-seer” is a lingering, haunting, tale of the Texas Navy to this very day.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

So sharing my experience hoping it helps.

1. 3rdRock notes helped me a lot! I would recommend taking them.
2. Mindset videos- went theough both AR and MR mindset videos. Helped improved the performance a lot
3. SH practice questions and mock test. Definitely do them. Did all the practice questions and mini tests. And 4 full length tests. Got 77, 75, 73 and 68 for mocks 1,2,3 & 4 respectively.
4. Had taken AR class on udemy but was not being disciplined enough to complete on time. So registered for simplilearn live class to ensure that I completed learning nd got 35 PDUs. If you are disciplined and can maintain a self study pace then go for AR. It's indeed good.
5. Also went through this video to get sequence etc clear. This video with 3rd rock notes helped with what should project manager do next questions https://youtu.be/5eXyCLf2JD0?si=2CUQD-EUiLNTgiOv
6. Someone shared this video and that too helped with lot of agile concepts https://youtu.be/qHCAdeZtYuE?si=JBR47JjO026mwc4Z
7. didn't have time for DM videos and mock 5. Originally had planned to do that. But lost a few days in between. So had to skip.

I feel that test was agile heavy for me. Gave me similar feel as mock test 4 from SH. Haven't done test 5 So not sure about that. 

While questions were similar to what you would find in SH but they were not exactly the same. Maybe it was nerves or something, but i didn't find them easier than SH as lot of people have.

I didn't practice any drag and drop or graph based questions. It was my mistake. But If you didn't practice them don't freak out. If your concepts are clear you will be able to answer the question in any form. 

Now about non-study prep. Prepared a small bag to carry the night before. Kept my id, some chocolate,  protein bar, specs mask and fever medicine as I had fever last week and water bottle, in the bag.

In the morning had breakfast and carried coffee in a big flask. Oh and wore blue 😊

At the center kept everything in the locker once the formalities were done.

I removed food, coffee, water and medicine from the bag and kept in the front while bag was at back in the locker. Don't touch your bag during break.

Took both the breaks. Used that time to drink coffee, eat chocolate, drink water, use washroom and do a minute of box breathing.

You are not allowed to wear watches too. So keep an eye on the clock when you take break. 

In the first section was not feeling confident and reviewed each question again. Wasted a lot of time in doing that. 2nd section onwards started using the flag option to review. Saved a lot of time. Completed exam with 15 minutes left on the clock.

Also note that in exam  time appears in minutes unlike in SH mocks.

1o84rwt,https://i.redd.it/qcr1y6puvgvf1.png,Through a Thousand Eyes - Longform RPG Spider Combat Simulator [Feedback Wanted],"Hello Reddit! I’ve heard your pleas for an incremental that’s longer than 3 hours, something you can sink countless weeks or months into, like NGU, FAMI or Perfect Tower. Without being tormented by a dev that let pay2win poison his game \[hi LavaFlame2\]. Something that is  not AI Slob made in 20 minutes over a cup of coffee AND not giving in to the the NodeBuster craze that’s going on right now! I wish, to present to you. My passion project, my baby. Which sadly is still in its infantile stage, but if you ask me, it still has more content than SOME games. Cough cough. Through a thousand eyes, aka Idle RPG Spider Combat Simulator \[TaTE sounds nicer than IRPCS, please have mercy on me\]. A game that tries to be the next long form Anti-Idle, Idle Skilling, WAMI, just a game packed with features that kinda make sense, and help you onto the “main” gamemode, the combat. Huh, I wonder how many more big names I can mention here, my SEO must be going through the roof right now. 

If that pitch managed to make you read until now, phew. All that caffeine really helped. Now I’ll be broad with you. My game is definitely missing a lot of features, is swarming with bugs, possibly even critical ones. And some design choices that will make even your grandpa wonder the hell is wrong with this guy. 

Which is why I came here actually. I wish to gain feedback. What to improve, what to change, what to add next even! I got a whole design document but I am always open to more ideas. I managed to get some feedback when I first posted on itch io, and an amazing wall of feedback from Pangbot back in Feedback Friday. But I always could use more judgy eyes. 

To actually talk about what’s IN the game right now. You can skip the next section if you want to experience this unadultered.

* Your usual Clicker experience, hold click on egg, gain skill points, buy upgrades to gain more exp. 
* Combat, the bread and butter of my game. 33 different stats, 21 ""special"" stats \[such as the stuff used by titans\], 4 team synergies, 3 different special spiders with their own unique effects and scaling. 22 different enemies with 12 more in the ""prestige fight"" and this list is only gonna get bigger in time. 
* Blood Sacrifice this is where you get rid of your excess spider allies and gain a new resource, one of your special spiders scales based on this. 
* Lactalot/StabALot the 2 questionable skeletons with an addiction for a certain white substance, they both offer you a special spider with different abilities. But there’s only so much milk to go around... who do you give it to? Beyond the initial quest that award you milk, this is your usual daily reward come back in 24h to claim your thingy 
* Titans oh boy you already know what this entitles. One big boss, limited attempts per day, time limits, deal as much damage as you can, persistent health. You know the gist. I tried my best to make them have more unique effects not just be your most basic buffed up basic enemy. Still need to add some proper rewards here... but I kinda ran out of ideas. 
* Mutations/Evolutions, you probably saw those 2 tabs but they’re currently work in progress, might make a separate post announcing those 2 when they’re ready. ETA a week maybe? 
* WebBuilder, we don’t talk about web builder.

So what I want to know the most currently: 

* How to improve upon the very first part of the game, the clicker part. Just adding more upgrades? More mechanics like the golden cookies from cookie clicker? 
* How balanced is the combat? Are the early enemies simple enough to not confuse you? Is it clear enough how to unlock more stats and what they do? Is the exp awarded too little? Is there any certain enemy/boss that feels way too oppressive? 
* Will the decision to make the camera movable/scrollable by the user come back to bite me in the ass later down development? I hope not lol 
* Are any of the features too confusing? 
* Probably too early to ask, but what about the art style? Currently only Arachne and the first enemy “Kappa” have finished art. Everything else is just random stuff from google images. But that’s the overall vibe, cutesy stuff. Don’t wanna trigger people’s arachnophobia with realistic arachnids now. 
* Are there any games that are doing exactly what I’m doing that I could take inspiration from? 

So I ask of you Incremental fans, tell me the goods, tell me the bads, most definitely point out the obvious, I am little dense sometimes... But help me turn this into something that will actually become part of the big names that keep getting thrown around every week on “what are we playing this week”. Something memorable, not just another cookie clicker clone. Yes I know big ideals, I'd probly be over the moon if I simply get a single comment saying “meh, it’s a game, would.” 

With that I wish y’all kind regards, see you in the comments. \~friendlySpuder. 

PS: For the love of god, if you don’t understand a word from the ticker messages, don’t google it. ESPECIALLY if it comes from \~Wifey.   
PSS: Darn I forgot to use the longed — lines and emojis to trigger people into thinking it’s written by AI. Oh well, there’s always next time.

1o84pje,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o84pje/someone_please_call_my_nameremember_me/,Someone please call my name....Remember me!!!,"I worked the rigs in Midland County three summers running. Nights out there are nothing like nights in town. The lights go down, the machines keep their slow sea-sound, and your breath makes those little clouds that hang in front of your face.

You learn to trust the man on the next shift because if you don’t people get hurt, and if someone gets hurt you don’t get to go home. That’s where the talk about the Tallyman started for me, low, half-joking, the way men tell the worst things.

“He shows up on night shift,” Old Harris said the first time I heard it. He had oil under his nails and a coffee in a Styrofoam sleeve, and he said it like he was remembering someone he used to work with. “Thin. Smells like old paper and rain. Carries a clipboard. Adding names.” He smiled at that last part like it was a punchline. No one else smiled.

“Like a union man?” somebody joked.

“Hell no,” Harris said. “Union man’s got paperwork that gets you paid. This one takes you off the page.”

That’s how the story got started: the missing kept happening in smaller towns, until the story travelled like a slow sickness. People said he looked like a man but moved wrong. They said his handwriting was tiny and patient.

Mostly they said one thing that never failed to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up: the instant he writes your name, you stop existing, not dead, not missing, just gone. Payroll shows a blank where you were. Your kid’s school photos have a hole. Your truck becomes someone else’s truck in the lot. Everyone else forgets you unless they saw it happen.

That last part, the witness rule, fixed the little logical hole everyone had about the story. If the Tallyman erased people from existence completely, how did anyone ever remember him? If no one remembered your partner, how would the story carry on? The rule’s ugly and simple: if you saw the Tallyman writing a name, if you saw someone vanish in front of you, you remember. You remember the thing that took them until the thing comes for you.

They say he was born at sea. That’s what the old timers added at the trailer, like an origin myth to make it older and more dangerous. Back when ships kept chalk tallies of crew, marks that meant a man was on board, storms would wipe the boards clean, the names lost to water and the mouths that should have called them.

The souls that had no one left to speak for them pooled in the cold places between tides. For a long time, a lot of misery and forgotten names gathered there, and something formed out of it. It learned to count. It learned the shape of saving and not-saving.

Then men moved from sea to land, chasing other fortunes, oil, rail, coal, and the forgetting followed. The Tallyman came inland like a tide.

We said it like that: a ledger made of grief. Nothing biblical about it. Just a man made of ledger ink and the world’s carelessness. That’s why he walks the rigs now, they said.

Places where names get reduced to numbers on a pad, where nights swallow faces and the sun forgets to shine on you if you don’t show up.

When Pete vanished, I remember exactly where I was. We were three weeks into a shutdown, fixing a pump that had gone noisy on the night shift. The air was still, the kind of still that hums in your ears. Pete was on the catwalk, laughing about a busted hose, holding a beer he wasn’t supposed to have.

I was hunched on the catwalk with grease on my gloves and a flashlight between my teeth, when I heard footsteps behind me. The boards creaked under them, neat and sure.

“You alright?” I called without thinking. The man stopped and said, “Almost done.”

And then, Nothing! It happened quiet, no crash, no shout. One second, he was there, laughing about a busted hose, and the next the space beside the pump was just *empty.* The beer he’d been holding sat balanced on the rail, fizz dying out. I kept waiting for the sound of a fall, a splash, anything. Nothing.

“Pete!” I yelled. The word sounded too small against all that machinery. I walked the catwalk twice, checked below, even swung the flashlight across the waste pit. The beam just caught rain mist and metal. No footprints, no drag marks, like he’d stepped off the world.

I ran back to the shack, half-sliding on the steel. “Have you seen Pete?” I asked the guys on shift. They looked at me blankly.

“Pete who?” Harris said.

“Come on, Pete! Two kids, drives that old Ford, always smokes on break.”

Harris frowned, searching his memory. “Man, you been pulling doubles. We ain’t got a Pete here.”

I stared at him until my throat closed. The radio crackled, some weather alert about a dust front, and just like that the conversation ended. Everyone moved on.

I tore through the lockers. His was there, only it wasn’t. Empty, unlabelled. Even the dent I’d noticed last week was gone. Payroll had no “Pete.” Safety logs skipped a number, like a page missing in a Bible.

The next morning his truck was gone from where he’d left it. The lot had its usual confusion, folks forget where they park after a twelve, but this felt different.

That’s when the fear really set in, not the kind that makes you run, but the kind that makes you *stay* because you need to prove the world is still solid.

I drove to the diner we’d eaten at three nights earlier. Same waitress. I asked if she remembered the guy with me, tall, shaved head, dirty coveralls. She blinked. “You came in alone, honey.”

I saw Bob and Rohdy sitting there having beer with Steak. I asked them but it was like everyone just rehearsed the same answer.

I kept talking until my voice hurt. “You worked with him last month. You lifted that pipe in three. Lunchbox had his name.” I named the job he’d done. I named the kids he mentioned once. The more I talked the more they looked at me pityingly, like I was telling a ghost story too late for coffee.

This is when I understood that every tale is true. I recounted the worst rule: if you *saw* the vanishing, you were the only one who would remember. And that memory marked you.

It put a ledger line across your life the way a stamp will mark a check. People would call you paranoid. You’d start seeing ledger marks in things you used to trust, photos, pay sheets, your daughter’s old library card.

You would be the story that kept the story alive, until the Tallyman came walking down the catwalk to your name.

I started looking for traces. I combed the truck lot, I combed the payroll, I combed my phone until my thumb ached. I found other things. A pile of old safety logs tied up in a box in the supply room with the corners eaten like someone had started at the margins and worked inward. Faded Polaroids with blank streaks. A lunchbox with a name ground halfway out. Once, in a drain, I found a little white bone, tiny, like from a child, laid in the mud like a marker. When I told Harris about it, he went very still and said, “Don’t go looking in drains.”

The nights got worse. At first it was small: hearing a pen that wasn’t there, scratching like someone filling a ledger in the dark. I’d go into the office at three in the morning and the projector would be on, showing a list of names, I didn’t recognize, a slow scroll of digits and shadows. Once, at the edge of sleep, I thought I saw someone standing in the floodlights across the pad, a shape pale as a ledger page. I blinked and it was gone.

Then dreams. Not full dreams, really, more like memories that didn’t belong to me. I’d be a boy on a ship watching chalk marks wiped clean, or I’d sit in a dark union hall as men’s names faded off a board. Each time, I woke up with the taste of salt like an old wound. Sometimes I felt hands like cold paper closing on my shoulders in the dark.

Pete was the first person I could prove I’d seen vanish. Afterwards, I started hearing about others from the barbs of rumor: a third shifter who’d missed a step and the next morning his bunk was empty, and his last name vanished from the roster; a welder’s daughter who didn’t exist in a photo album the family kept for years.

Names started to look like fragile things to me, like paper in wind. I went back shaking. Every road sign looked wrong, every mile marker new. In my phone’s photos the seat beside me was empty. Even the reflection in the window showed only one cup in the holder.

For two days I barely slept. I started searching online: *oilfield disappearances, tallyman, men erased from payroll.* Nothing useful, just a few ghost-forum posts, a Reddit thread that ended mid-sentence. But one link led to an old newspaper clipping from 1958, “Inspector Found Dead After Rig Collapse, Names Missing from Record.” The article mentioned “a company man keeping tallies” right before the blowout. The reporter died a week later.

I printed the article, circled the line. The paper smelled like rust. That night, the printer in my motel room started up on its own and spat out a blank sheet with a single straight black mark across it.

The next few nights were worse. Tools shifted places. My radio would whisper names I didn’t know and then fall silent. Once, the rig alarm sounded at 3:17 a.m., but the panel showed no fault. When I checked the pad, the air smelled like rain even though the sky was clear. In the condensation on a tank wall, someone had traced a line down the middle, one side clean, one side smeared.

Harris said I needed rest. Maybe……. maybe he was right. I had been pulling doubles for quit a sometime. I needed all the money I can get to put my Nora in the private school. But this …this is not the first time I am doing doubles ……I have doing it from the last 10 or 15 years. I never had trouble sleeping.

But this time when I closed my eyes, I saw ledger paper and thin handwriting crawling across it, adding names I couldn’t quite read.

I stayed late again, half hoping to see something that made sense of it all. The field was black, windless, stars sharp as nails. I was tightening a valve when footsteps came along the catwalk, neat, measured.

“You alright?” I called.

A voice answered, “Almost done.”

It was the same voice, I heard when Pete Vanished. And then I saw.

A tall, narrow man stepped into the floodlight. Coveralls, clipboard, eyes that looked like they’d seen too many ledgers. He smelled of oil and damp paper.

“You knew?” I asked. “You with inspection?”

He tilted his head, glanced at my name tag, and started to write. Tiny, patient strokes.

“Who are you?”

He smiled, friendly as a funeral director. “Tallyman,” he said. “I count what stays.”

His voice had that dry paper-on-paper sound. He closed the clipboard softly and nodded, like we’d finished a transaction.

I backed away. “What happens to the ones who don’t stay?”

He didn’t answer. He just looked at the pump behind me and wrote one more line. The pen scraped once, that soft, terminal sound, and the floodlight flickered.

I turned to look. The valve wrench I’d been holding a second ago lay on the grate. For a moment I thought I saw another shadow beside mine, thinner, fainter. Then it was gone.

He walked past me, slow and deliberate, boots leaving no oil print. The air smelled like copper and rain. Then nothing, no footfalls, no breath, no world.

When the lights steadied, I was alone.

It’s worse in the Nameless, the place he takes you to. When my name finally went on the list, it was almost quiet. I felt the pen like a cool stone press into the back of my neck, and then the world tilted, and the rig was wrong.

The lights were the same but off, like a photo under a lamp. Men I’d worked with for years stood there and I knew they should be warm and laughing, but their faces had that ledger-smoothness, like they were being rubbed out around the edges.

Then I saw Pete.

He stood at the far edge of the rig as if he’d been waiting. He smiled that same dumb smile he’d had before he was taken. But the smile carried a weight that wasn’t a smile, like a man who’d read a bad book and finally understood the punchline.

“You don’t get it,” he said, and the voice was hollow, like something learned by repeating a word until it had no meaning. “You think it’s a ledger. It’s a hunger.”

Around us, and it was us, but not the rigs, people from different times stood shoulder to shoulder. Men with oil-stained hands and sailors with salt lines on their cheeks and kids in little shoes from decades ago. Some wore the same rusted hats; some wore uniforms that hadn’t been used in a hundred years. All of them had the same look: hollow-eyed, patient, like folks waiting for a train that never came.

“This is Tallyman’s place. It lives off the energy,” Pete said, as if reciting something he’d learned in a class. “Once you’re transferred, you’re not taken. You’re used. Your traces get chewed down until you’re just a shape that remembers the pinch. He eats the part of you that’s memory. It hurts like someone squeezing your head every moment. You forget your children first, then your favourite song, then how to spit. They keep you long. They like to let the forgetting swell.”

I thought of my daughter and the drawing taped to my dash and I felt the cold reach up my ribs. Around us some of the figures drifted toward the rail and pressed their hands to the metal, looking down like men who’d lost something overboard.

“Can you get back?” I asked him, because you ask the thing everyone asks when you’re trapped in a hole.

He looked at me like a man who’d been asked to explain his own death. “Once, maybe,” he said. “If someone out there remembers you enough to call your name. That’s the trick. Memory is the only bridge.” He sounded almost hopeful then, as if the idea of someone remembering was a small comfort.

“Who remembers us?” I asked, my throat gone dry.

He smiled that dumb smile. “Sometimes a mother calls her child back. Sometimes a son remembers his father. Mostly, it’s just empty. If nobody remembers, you unspool and then you’re like… this.” He spread his hands and something in his fingers looked like a dust of ledger marks.

The knowledge felt like a weight. If someone out there called my name, maybe I’d go back. But names don’t get called in a world that has folded you out of. People don’t sing the names of those who aren’t their neighbor’s problem.

Then he said something I didn’t expect: “He likes witnesses, someone to carry his tale. He gets his existence off the misery and pain we feel, when we tell of him.” Pete’s eyes went thin. “You told them, didn’t you? You told them about me.”

I did. I’d told them. I’d been the one with the memory. I’d carried the tale in the way a smuggler carries contraband. And that’s when I understood the cruelty of it: we kept the Tallyman alive by telling the story. The only reason the story survives was because the witnesses exist, and the witnesses keep the ledger hungry.

Then I saw him clearly for the first time.

The Tallyman wasn’t a man at all. He was a shape that refused to stay one shape, a body made of black, tar-thick fluid that dripped and folded back into itself. Faces bloomed across his surface, hundreds of them, appearing and dissolving like bubbles breaking a dark tide.

Men, women, even children, their mouths open in silent screams. Every time one surfaced, a wave of emotion hit me: sorrow, rage, guilt, despair. It was like standing in the middle of all human regret, the air vibrating with grief.

He moved toward me without walking. The air seemed to carry him. The sound came next, that same dry scratching, the pen that never stopped writing. Each stroke wasn’t sound but pressure, a vibration in my skull that made my vision pulse. When he stopped, the pain began.

It started like a headache, a knot behind my eyes. Then it grew. The world tilted and I felt something reach into me, not hands but gravity itself, pulling pieces of thought loose one by one. My memories went in order, smallest to largest, the smell of coffee, the face of a friend, the sound of a song. Then heavier things. My daughter’s eyes.

My wife’s laugh. It wasn’t fading, it was being *squeezed out*, like something wrung dry. I fell to my knees, clutching my head, begging for it to stop, but the words came out thin, like air leaking from paper.

The Tallyman watched without eyes. His faces kept shifting, some pleading, some calm, some smiling faintly like they’d accepted it. I shouted, “Why are you doing this?” The sound of the pen paused, and for the briefest second, all the faces turned toward me. A single word seemed to roll through them in one shared breath: *Balance.*

Then the pain surged again, and everything went white.

When I came back, I was lying on the deck of the rig. The sky above was flat gray, the kind that could have belonged to any hour, any year. The Tallyman was gone, and Pete was standing near the railing, hands in his pockets, his face empty of expression.

“You’ll get used to it,” he said. His voice echoed strangely, like it came from a tunnel. Around us, more figures stood near the edges of the deck, silhouettes of men I half-recognized, all of them slow and distant, as if half-asleep. Their outlines were faint, dissolving at the edges like mist.

“How long has it been?” I asked.

Pete looked out at the horizon, which wasn’t really a horizon, just a gray smear fading into nothing. “Long enough,” he said. “You stop counting. He feeds off the memories. The pain makes it easy for him.”

I looked down at my hands. The color was wrong. The skin had gone pale, almost transparent, and I could see faint lines underneath, like someone had drawn on me in pencil and started to erase it. I tried to remember my daughter’s name, but the sound slipped away before I could finish it. The loss hit harder than the pain.

Pete watched me struggle. “You won’t remember what you lost soon. That’s how he keeps you quiet.”

I don’t know how much time passed after that. Time doesn’t behave right there. Sometimes I thought I heard other voices from far below, whispers, sobs, fragments of laughter, all of them blending in a sound like running water. The world had no wind, no sun, just that endless low hum and the smell of oil and rain that never fell.

Then, one day, something cut through it.

It was faint at first, a soft static from nowhere, like a radio trying to tune in through the noise. Then I heard the words, small, trembling, but bright and familiar. “Dad… Dad, where are you?”

I froze. It was my daughter’s voice, clear as daylight. Every part of me that still remembered her snapped awake. I could see her again, the curl of her hair, the necklace she never took off, the way she’d grin when she was trying not to laugh. The sound of her voice carried warmth into this place that hadn’t known warmth in forever.

Pete turned toward me, his expression unreadable. “You hear her?” he asked.

I nodded. My chest hurt in a new way, sharp, alive.

“Then go,” he said. “Before he notices.”

The gray around us began to tremble, as if the air itself had become liquid. I felt something pulling at me from deep inside, a force that didn’t belong here. The pull got stronger, and the light changed, shifting from dull gray to something almost white. My feet left the deck. The others watched, but none of them moved to follow.

“Dad!” the voice called again. “Dad, it’s me! Come home!”

The pull turned into a rush. The deck, the sky, the figures, all peeled away like layers of wet paint. For a heartbeat, I saw her standing in the kitchen, sunlight on the counter, pancakes on a plate, syrup on her hands. She reached for me, smiling, her hand small and real and warm.

Then everything shook. The kitchen flickered. Her face blurred into white, then black, then white again. Somewhere behind it all I heard a faint scratch, the sound of a pen finishing its line.

Everything went quiet.

Maybe she pulled me out. Maybe that was just the last flicker of my mind, trying to give shape to the light before it went out. I don’t know. I only know that for a moment, I felt something that wasn’t pain.

If you ever find a photograph with a pale line scored in one corner, say the name written on the back. Say it loud enough for memory to hear. It might be mine. It might be Pete’s. It might be whoever comes next.",2,1760617419.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1o84n2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o84n2h/please_someone_call_my_nameremember_me/,Please someone call my name.....Remember me!!!,"I worked the rigs in Midland County three summers running. Nights out there are nothing like nights in town. The lights go down, the machines keep their slow sea-sound, and your breath makes those little clouds that hang in front of your face. 

You learn to trust the man on the next shift because if you don’t people get hurt, and if someone gets hurt you don’t get to go home. That’s where the talk about the Tallyman started for me, low, half-joking, the way men tell the worst things.

“He shows up on night shift,” Old Harris said the first time I heard it. He had oil under his nails and a coffee in a Styrofoam sleeve, and he said it like he was remembering someone he used to work with. “Thin. Smells like old paper and rain. Carries a clipboard. Adding names.” He smiled at that last part like it was a punchline. No one else smiled.

“Like a union man?” somebody joked.

“Hell no,” Harris said. “Union man’s got paperwork that gets you paid. This one takes you off the page.”

That’s how the story got started: the missing kept happening in smaller towns, until the story travelled like a slow sickness. People said he looked like a man but moved wrong. They said his handwriting was tiny and patient. 

Mostly they said one thing that never failed to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up: the instant he writes your name, you stop existing, not dead, not missing, just gone. Payroll shows a blank where you were. Your kid’s school photos have a hole. Your truck becomes someone else’s truck in the lot. Everyone else forgets you unless they saw it happen.

That last part, the witness rule, fixed the little logical hole everyone had about the story. If the Tallyman erased people from existence completely, how did anyone ever remember him? If no one remembered your partner, how would the story carry on? The rule’s ugly and simple: if you saw the Tallyman writing a name, if you saw someone vanish in front of you, you remember. You remember the thing that took them until the thing comes for you.

They say he was born at sea. That’s what the old timers added at the trailer, like an origin myth to make it older and more dangerous. Back when ships kept chalk tallies of crew, marks that meant a man was on board, storms would wipe the boards clean, the names lost to water and the mouths that should have called them. 

The souls that had no one left to speak for them pooled in the cold places between tides. For a long time, a lot of misery and forgotten names gathered there, and something formed out of it. It learned to count. It learned the shape of saving and not-saving. 

Then men moved from sea to land, chasing other fortunes, oil, rail, coal, and the forgetting followed. The Tallyman came inland like a tide.

We said it like that: a ledger made of grief. Nothing biblical about it. Just a man made of ledger ink and the world’s carelessness. That’s why he walks the rigs now, they said. 

Places where names get reduced to numbers on a pad, where nights swallow faces and the sun forgets to shine on you if you don’t show up.

When Pete vanished, I remember exactly where I was. We were three weeks into a shutdown, fixing a pump that had gone noisy on the night shift. The air was still, the kind of still that hums in your ears. Pete was on the catwalk, laughing about a busted hose, holding a beer he wasn’t supposed to have.

I was hunched on the catwalk with grease on my gloves and a flashlight between my teeth, when I heard footsteps behind me. The boards creaked under them, neat and sure.

“You alright?” I called without thinking. The man stopped and said, “Almost done.”

And then, Nothing! It happened quiet, no crash, no shout. One second, he was there, laughing about a busted hose, and the next the space beside the pump was just *empty.* The beer he’d been holding sat balanced on the rail, fizz dying out. I kept waiting for the sound of a fall, a splash, anything. Nothing.

“Pete!” I yelled. The word sounded too small against all that machinery. I walked the catwalk twice, checked below, even swung the flashlight across the waste pit. The beam just caught rain mist and metal. No footprints, no drag marks, like he’d stepped off the world.

I ran back to the shack, half-sliding on the steel. “Have you seen Pete?” I asked the guys on shift. They looked at me blankly.

“Pete who?” Harris said.

“Come on, Pete! Two kids, drives that old Ford, always smokes on break.”

Harris frowned, searching his memory. “Man, you been pulling doubles. We ain’t got a Pete here.”

I stared at him until my throat closed. The radio crackled, some weather alert about a dust front, and just like that the conversation ended. Everyone moved on.

I tore through the lockers. His was there, only it wasn’t. Empty, unlabelled. Even the dent I’d noticed last week was gone. Payroll had no “Pete.” Safety logs skipped a number, like a page missing in a Bible.

The next morning his truck was gone from where he’d left it. The lot had its usual confusion, folks forget where they park after a twelve, but this felt different.

That’s when the fear really set in, not the kind that makes you run, but the kind that makes you *stay* because you need to prove the world is still solid. 

I drove to the diner we’d eaten at three nights earlier. Same waitress. I asked if she remembered the guy with me, tall, shaved head, dirty coveralls. She blinked. “You came in alone, honey.”

I saw Bob and Rohdy sitting there having beer with Steak. I asked them but it was like everyone just rehearsed the same answer.

I kept talking until my voice hurt. “You worked with him last month. You lifted that pipe in three. Lunchbox had his name.” I named the job he’d done. I named the kids he mentioned once. The more I talked the more they looked at me pityingly, like I was telling a ghost story too late for coffee.

This is when I understood that every tale is true. I recounted the worst rule: if you *saw* the vanishing, you were the only one who would remember. And that memory marked you.

It put a ledger line across your life the way a stamp will mark a check. People would call you paranoid. You’d start seeing ledger marks in things you used to trust, photos, pay sheets, your daughter’s old library card.

You would be the story that kept the story alive, until the Tallyman came walking down the catwalk to your name.

I started looking for traces. I combed the truck lot, I combed the payroll, I combed my phone until my thumb ached. I found other things. A pile of old safety logs tied up in a box in the supply room with the corners eaten like someone had started at the margins and worked inward. Faded Polaroids with blank streaks. A lunchbox with a name ground halfway out. Once, in a drain, I found a little white bone, tiny, like from a child, laid in the mud like a marker. When I told Harris about it, he went very still and said, “Don’t go looking in drains.”

The nights got worse. At first it was small: hearing a pen that wasn’t there, scratching like someone filling a ledger in the dark. I’d go into the office at three in the morning and the projector would be on, showing a list of names, I didn’t recognize, a slow scroll of digits and shadows. Once, at the edge of sleep, I thought I saw someone standing in the floodlights across the pad, a shape pale as a ledger page. I blinked and it was gone.

Then dreams. Not full dreams, really, more like memories that didn’t belong to me. I’d be a boy on a ship watching chalk marks wiped clean, or I’d sit in a dark union hall as men’s names faded off a board. Each time, I woke up with the taste of salt like an old wound. Sometimes I felt hands like cold paper closing on my shoulders in the dark.

Pete was the first person I could prove I’d seen vanish. Afterwards, I started hearing about others from the barbs of rumor: a third shifter who’d missed a step and the next morning his bunk was empty, and his last name vanished from the roster; a welder’s daughter who didn’t exist in a photo album the family kept for years. 

Names started to look like fragile things to me, like paper in wind. I went back shaking. Every road sign looked wrong, every mile marker new. In my phone’s photos the seat beside me was empty. Even the reflection in the window showed only one cup in the holder.

For two days I barely slept. I started searching online: *oilfield disappearances, tallyman, men erased from payroll.* Nothing useful, just a few ghost-forum posts, a Reddit thread that ended mid-sentence. But one link led to an old newspaper clipping from 1958, “Inspector Found Dead After Rig Collapse, Names Missing from Record.” The article mentioned “a company man keeping tallies” right before the blowout. The reporter died a week later.

I printed the article, circled the line. The paper smelled like rust. That night, the printer in my motel room started up on its own and spat out a blank sheet with a single straight black mark across it.

The next few nights were worse. Tools shifted places. My radio would whisper names I didn’t know and then fall silent. Once, the rig alarm sounded at 3:17 a.m., but the panel showed no fault. When I checked the pad, the air smelled like rain even though the sky was clear. In the condensation on a tank wall, someone had traced a line down the middle, one side clean, one side smeared.

Harris said I needed rest. Maybe……. maybe he was right. I had been pulling doubles for quit a sometime. I needed all the money I can get to put my Nora in the private school. But this …this is not the first time I am doing doubles ……I have doing it from the last 10 or 15 years. I never had trouble sleeping.

But this time when I closed my eyes, I saw ledger paper and thin handwriting crawling across it, adding names I couldn’t quite read.

I stayed late again, half hoping to see something that made sense of it all. The field was black, windless, stars sharp as nails. I was tightening a valve when footsteps came along the catwalk, neat, measured.

“You alright?” I called.

A voice answered, “Almost done.”

It was the same voice, I heard when Pete Vanished. And then I saw.

A tall, narrow man stepped into the floodlight. Coveralls, clipboard, eyes that looked like they’d seen too many ledgers. He smelled of oil and damp paper.

“You knew?” I asked. “You with inspection?”

He tilted his head, glanced at my name tag, and started to write. Tiny, patient strokes.

“Who are you?”

He smiled, friendly as a funeral director. “Tallyman,” he said. “I count what stays.”

His voice had that dry paper-on-paper sound. He closed the clipboard softly and nodded, like we’d finished a transaction.

I backed away. “What happens to the ones who don’t stay?”

He didn’t answer. He just looked at the pump behind me and wrote one more line. The pen scraped once, that soft, terminal sound, and the floodlight flickered.

I turned to look. The valve wrench I’d been holding a second ago lay on the grate. For a moment I thought I saw another shadow beside mine, thinner, fainter. Then it was gone.

He walked past me, slow and deliberate, boots leaving no oil print. The air smelled like copper and rain. Then nothing, no footfalls, no breath, no world.

When the lights steadied, I was alone.

It’s worse in the Nameless, the place he takes you to. When my name finally went on the list, it was almost quiet. I felt the pen like a cool stone press into the back of my neck, and then the world tilted, and the rig was wrong. 

The lights were the same but off, like a photo under a lamp. Men I’d worked with for years stood there and I knew they should be warm and laughing, but their faces had that ledger-smoothness, like they were being rubbed out around the edges.

Then I saw Pete.

He stood at the far edge of the rig as if he’d been waiting. He smiled that same dumb smile he’d had before he was taken. But the smile carried a weight that wasn’t a smile, like a man who’d read a bad book and finally understood the punchline.

“You don’t get it,” he said, and the voice was hollow, like something learned by repeating a word until it had no meaning. “You think it’s a ledger. It’s a hunger.”

Around us, and it was us, but not the rigs, people from different times stood shoulder to shoulder. Men with oil-stained hands and sailors with salt lines on their cheeks and kids in little shoes from decades ago. Some wore the same rusted hats; some wore uniforms that hadn’t been used in a hundred years. All of them had the same look: hollow-eyed, patient, like folks waiting for a train that never came.

“This is Tallyman’s place. It lives off the energy,” Pete said, as if reciting something he’d learned in a class. “Once you’re transferred, you’re not taken. You’re used. Your traces get chewed down until you’re just a shape that remembers the pinch. He eats the part of you that’s memory. It hurts like someone squeezing your head every moment. You forget your children first, then your favourite song, then how to spit. They keep you long. They like to let the forgetting swell.”

I thought of my daughter and the drawing taped to my dash and I felt the cold reach up my ribs. Around us some of the figures drifted toward the rail and pressed their hands to the metal, looking down like men who’d lost something overboard.

“Can you get back?” I asked him, because you ask the thing everyone asks when you’re trapped in a hole.

He looked at me like a man who’d been asked to explain his own death. “Once, maybe,” he said. “If someone out there remembers you enough to call your name. That’s the trick. Memory is the only bridge.” He sounded almost hopeful then, as if the idea of someone remembering was a small comfort.

“Who remembers us?” I asked, my throat gone dry.

He smiled that dumb smile. “Sometimes a mother calls her child back. Sometimes a son remembers his father. Mostly, it’s just empty. If nobody remembers, you unspool and then you’re like… this.” He spread his hands and something in his fingers looked like a dust of ledger marks.

The knowledge felt like a weight. If someone out there called my name, maybe I’d go back. But names don’t get called in a world that has folded you out of. People don’t sing the names of those who aren’t their neighbor’s problem.

Then he said something I didn’t expect: “He likes witnesses, someone to carry his tale. He gets his existence off the misery and pain we feel, when we tell of him.” Pete’s eyes went thin. “You told them, didn’t you? You told them about me.”

I did. I’d told them. I’d been the one with the memory. I’d carried the tale in the way a smuggler carries contraband. And that’s when I understood the cruelty of it: we kept the Tallyman alive by telling the story. The only reason the story survives was because the witnesses exist, and the witnesses keep the ledger hungry.

Then I saw him clearly for the first time.

The Tallyman wasn’t a man at all. He was a shape that refused to stay one shape, a body made of black, tar-thick fluid that dripped and folded back into itself. Faces bloomed across his surface, hundreds of them, appearing and dissolving like bubbles breaking a dark tide. 

Men, women, even children, their mouths open in silent screams. Every time one surfaced, a wave of emotion hit me: sorrow, rage, guilt, despair. It was like standing in the middle of all human regret, the air vibrating with grief.

He moved toward me without walking. The air seemed to carry him. The sound came next, that same dry scratching, the pen that never stopped writing. Each stroke wasn’t sound but pressure, a vibration in my skull that made my vision pulse. When he stopped, the pain began.

It started like a headache, a knot behind my eyes. Then it grew. The world tilted and I felt something reach into me, not hands but gravity itself, pulling pieces of thought loose one by one. My memories went in order, smallest to largest, the smell of coffee, the face of a friend, the sound of a song. Then heavier things. My daughter’s eyes. 

My wife’s laugh. It wasn’t fading, it was being *squeezed out*, like something wrung dry. I fell to my knees, clutching my head, begging for it to stop, but the words came out thin, like air leaking from paper.

The Tallyman watched without eyes. His faces kept shifting, some pleading, some calm, some smiling faintly like they’d accepted it. I shouted, “Why are you doing this?” The sound of the pen paused, and for the briefest second, all the faces turned toward me. A single word seemed to roll through them in one shared breath: *Balance.*

Then the pain surged again, and everything went white.

When I came back, I was lying on the deck of the rig. The sky above was flat gray, the kind that could have belonged to any hour, any year. The Tallyman was gone, and Pete was standing near the railing, hands in his pockets, his face empty of expression.

“You’ll get used to it,” he said. His voice echoed strangely, like it came from a tunnel. Around us, more figures stood near the edges of the deck, silhouettes of men I half-recognized, all of them slow and distant, as if half-asleep. Their outlines were faint, dissolving at the edges like mist.

“How long has it been?” I asked.

Pete looked out at the horizon, which wasn’t really a horizon, just a gray smear fading into nothing. “Long enough,” he said. “You stop counting. He feeds off the memories. The pain makes it easy for him.”

I looked down at my hands. The color was wrong. The skin had gone pale, almost transparent, and I could see faint lines underneath, like someone had drawn on me in pencil and started to erase it. I tried to remember my daughter’s name, but the sound slipped away before I could finish it. The loss hit harder than the pain.

Pete watched me struggle. “You won’t remember what you lost soon. That’s how he keeps you quiet.”

I don’t know how much time passed after that. Time doesn’t behave right there. Sometimes I thought I heard other voices from far below, whispers, sobs, fragments of laughter, all of them blending in a sound like running water. The world had no wind, no sun, just that endless low hum and the smell of oil and rain that never fell.

Then, one day, something cut through it.

It was faint at first, a soft static from nowhere, like a radio trying to tune in through the noise. Then I heard the words, small, trembling, but bright and familiar. “Dad… Dad, where are you?”

I froze. It was my daughter’s voice, clear as daylight. Every part of me that still remembered her snapped awake. I could see her again, the curl of her hair, the necklace she never took off, the way she’d grin when she was trying not to laugh. The sound of her voice carried warmth into this place that hadn’t known warmth in forever.

Pete turned toward me, his expression unreadable. “You hear her?” he asked.

I nodded. My chest hurt in a new way, sharp, alive.

“Then go,” he said. “Before he notices.”

The gray around us began to tremble, as if the air itself had become liquid. I felt something pulling at me from deep inside, a force that didn’t belong here. The pull got stronger, and the light changed, shifting from dull gray to something almost white. My feet left the deck. The others watched, but none of them moved to follow.

“Dad!” the voice called again. “Dad, it’s me! Come home!”

The pull turned into a rush. The deck, the sky, the figures, all peeled away like layers of wet paint. For a heartbeat, I saw her standing in the kitchen, sunlight on the counter, pancakes on a plate, syrup on her hands. She reached for me, smiling, her hand small and real and warm.

Then everything shook. The kitchen flickered. Her face blurred into white, then black, then white again. Somewhere behind it all I heard a faint scratch, the sound of a pen finishing its line.

Everything went quiet.

Maybe she pulled me out. Maybe that was just the last flicker of my mind, trying to give shape to the light before it went out. I don’t know. I only know that for a moment, I felt something that wasn’t pain.

That’s it. Tabby logs and categorizes your expenses, updates your dashboard, and even handles recurring payments — all inside Telegram.

Here’s what makes Tabby effortless:

* **Quick logging** \- track spending in seconds, no extra apps.
* **Budget tracking** \- set limits and stay in control.
* **Bill splitting** \- no awkward math, no missed payments.

Tabby isn’t just about numbers - it’s about feeling **in control of your money**.

Despite some of the finest grind settings on my grinder, I am still not getting shots into the 25-30 sec range and can't even get past step 1 of dialling in my beans.

I have previosuly really struggled to get anything light roasted dialed in succesfully at all so I bought 1kg of some fairly cheap, dark roasted espresso beans to start with something 'easy' enough to get me understanding the basics.

I've had my espresso machine for years but really never satisfyingly felt I really could use it even on a basic level - so I recently installed a PID to try and make things a bit easier but despite this I'm still struggling.

Currently using some Lidl barista dark roasted beans to try and get started again with something 'easy'.

My setup:

* Gaggia classic (2013) with Shades of Coffee PID installed
* Sage smart grinder pro
* Naked portafilter, 18G VST basket.

Shots:

* Puck prep - grinding into blind shaker, 4-5 seconds of shaking and then tapping into naked portafilter, then a basic tamper (as consistently as possible)
* Brew temp 93, machine and grouphead fully warmed up
* 18g in 40g out
* Grinder is set to almost as fine as the grinder can go (internal burr setting 2, grinder seting is at 2)

Despite this I am STILL only pulling shots in under 20 seconds. They taste...fine but fairly bitter (granted this is mediocre coffee I'm using)

They are not gushing in a particularly crazy way and aren't very obviously chanelling all over the place.

What's my issue here?

Bad grinder?

Bad puck prep?

Idiocy?

Do I just have to crank my grinder down as low as it will possible go?

Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o84jcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1o84jcw/keeping_breastmilk_at_the_bedside_cool_overnight/,Keeping breastmilk at the bedside cool overnight... any hacks?,"I express or collect letdown during the night. The kitchen is upstairs and I just loathe going up during the night to put what I've expressed in the fridge. I know there are different guidelines of how long is okay to leave it out up to 6-8 hours but sometimes I just feel icky about it. 

I usually just have a cooler bag with ice packs but it's annoying to zip and unzip in the night and bulky on my bedside table. I bought a smaller bottle bag and was using those insulin ice packs and that took up less room but it still kinda annoying and loud. 

Next up I was thinking of using an insulated coffee cup/water bottle with some reusable ice cubes in there? So I could just have the frozen cubes in there and pour what I express straight in? Then at least it would just be one water bottle. 

I've seen the Momcozy coolers but not sure I can justify the price for just my laziness of not wanting to go upstairs, and even the dupes are expensive. I've bought a lot of baby junk already lol. 

Would love to hear how you manage this and if you have any interesting work arounds! ",1,1760616937.0,breastfeeding,10,1.0,False
