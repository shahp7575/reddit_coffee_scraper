I am staying in nagpur for almost 1.5 years and I need your help as I am not much aware of places here. 
So there's a friend of mine from Hyderabad visiting nagpur for his business purpose in the month of February. I want to take him to good and authentic places for food and if there is any good places to visit (as far as I know there's nothing to take him for other than food places ).
Please people guide me with it. 
-Suggest me Good coffee place
-Places with good ambience and food is major requirement. 
-Places with different cuisines and continental dishes. 
As far as I know, 
I have been to Co. So. And food and ambience is also good there. 
Raasta's, Farzi's, high steak's ambience is good but not sure about food. 
I found hitchki as Good as Co. So. 
If you guys have more good recommendations please tell me. ",1,1768932339.0,nagpur,0,1.0,False

I have never posted on reddit before so I don't really know what i'm doing but I am just genuinely baffled at what just happened and I want some insight from people who may know. 

I was just on a **private** conversation thread on **snapchat**, where the conversation went something like this:

Friend: (posts on story about the 'origin of coffee')

Me: Swiped up and asks ""ethiopia?""

Friend: ""Yes, it's beautiful.""

Me: ""It really is, I've been.""

  
Not even 5 minutes later after sending that message, **before my friend even opened the chat**, I received a sms text message to my phone number saying this:

""Get 30 minutes to Ethiopia for just 3.99. Download the Slick app and start making calls to Ethiopia. Download: (insert suspicious link I did not click on) Text STOP to cancel""

This literally alarmed me so much to the point I am turning to reddit. Things to note: I have not interacted with anything to do with Ethiopia **other than the snapchat story** in **years.** I don't regularly see or am targeted with anything to do with Ethiopia by any algorithm I interact with. I also have never given this friend my personal contact information (phone number, full name, instagram, etc), other than my snapchat profile. 

So, I guess my question is- am I just really that in the dark about how personal data is accessible and moved around/sold?? I hate to not be technologically literate so any **advice or insight is very much appreciated.** ",0,1768932204.0,cybersecurity_help,1,0.5,False
1qi8cxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1qi8cxi/do_some_coffees_just_feel_harder_to_drink_day/,Do some coffees just feel harder to drink day after day?,"This might sound vague, but I’m trying to understand a pattern.

Some coffees taste great at first, but after a few cups (or a few days) I find myself drinking less, skipping cups, or switching back to something else. It’s not about flavour being bad, more about how “easy” the coffee feels to live with.

I’ve noticed this more with brighter or sharper coffees, and less with coffees that are heavier-bodied, lower-toned, or traditionally processed,  the kind that tend to feel smoother and easier to drink over time.

Curious:

* Have you ever reduced cups or switched coffees because something felt a bit harsh over repeated drinking?
* Do you have coffees you enjoy occasionally but wouldn’t want as your daily driver?
* Or is this just a brewing / preference issue in your experience?

Endless articles, clickbait headlines, conflicting stories, and zero time to actually read everything. I’d either spend way too long scrolling or just avoid the news altogether.

1. There’s too much news and too long (like Game of Thrones never ending Winter haha)
2. It’s harder than ever to know what’s actually true and how to verify   

Last month I started experimenting with a different approach, very short, quick summaries that tell you what actually happened in under 9 seconds, plus a way to quickly check if a story is likely legit or misleading.

Between global events, local stuff that still matters day-to-day, and headlines constantly contradicting each other, I either end up doom-scrolling or just tuning out completely.

Having local and global news in one place also makes a big difference. I don’t want five apps just to understand what’s going on. I believe my solution is Quick News Global (AI). Have you guys heard of this app in the USA?

I’m curious how you deal with this:

Do you still read full articles?  
Do you trust headlines anymore?  
Would built in news verification actually change how you consume news?

1qi89e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/1qi89e8/coffee_study_options/,Coffee - Study Options,"Hi all,

  
Someone a month or two ago posted a spreadsheet r/g their ratings around coffee shops and ranked them on a few topics - including their ranking for good studying.

  
Anyways,  I've been working my way through them - with a few additions - but I can't find that post or the spreadsheet - so if that guy is still here I want to talk to you.  I have notes.  and I need the spreadsheet again so I can try other coffee shops.

  
Incidentally, my own generic reviews so far.  Please take them with a grain of salt and if you have money for coffee spread it around to the businesses you think deserve it!  

1) Shades of Brown - top pick.  The staff are a cool vibe.  The inside is pretty magical.  I'd call it my Cafe Nervosa if I were Frasier.  The con - the backroom is freezing.  I usually end up there, with a jacket on and gloves and am still cold.  The main room is pleasantly warm.  The clientele are a cool vibe too.  At least, they are my vibe.  They also only have cold brew available as decaf (though they can make a steamed latte with it).  They do have good loose leaf teas and a peppermint one that is caffeine free. They have a card that after so many visits you can get a free drink.

  
2) Collab Coffee - decent.  The staff are not the vibe.  At least I never feel ""welcomed"" there - which is a big deal of why I seek out coffee shops.  No one is ever rude, more just like short.  Kind of a ""what do you want"" vibe.  No fault to them individually - who knows maybe the managers suck?  But compared to Shades of Brown where it's like they are happy to see you come in - it's a no go for me.  However, the outdoor area is nice to sit at when the weather is nice and they can do decaf anything.  They also do a 10% off with the Keepitlocal card. The clientele are pretty decent, if not as eclectic as Shades of Brown.

  
3) Parea coffee - this one was ranked high on that dudes list.  I like that it's across from campus.  The staff are definitely on the friendlier side.  It's warm.  They do decaf anything as well and have a 10% keepitlocal card.  The clientele kind of give me South Tulsa creepy religious vibes at times - but it is a good focus spot because no one really stands out to distract you.  ",1,1768931887.0,tulsa,0,1.0,False
1qi88tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1qi88tj/babies_learning_their_vocals/,Babies learning their vocals,"Somewhat of a discussion, somewhat an ask for advice all in one!

We all remember baby learning to coo and babble... We just went through it over here! Now we are at the baby is learning volume and pitch... oh boy, high pitched squeals and max volume. Mine is just wrapping up month 4 and the volume increases and pitches are nuts. Even causing some sleep discrepancies (as bad as weeks 1-4 were).

My thought is trying the same as a dog, don't react until it's a good noise. Sounds bad little one being compared to a dog but... haha it kind of compares..

The only other thought, or change, would be to reduce the stimulation during tummy time. We started getting a bunch of stuff that is attention grabbing to keep baby on tummy time longer but maybe this is over stimulation and making baby bored easier so maybe reason for more screams/yells at night?

Sort of a, you get used to coffee you start needing it?

Love to hear some thoughts and stories on the matter, both mitigating baby voice (not trying to quiet the child just reduce the pitch/volume some), and more importantly the sleep/stimulation part... could I be on to something? The screeches would be less of a heavy sigh of the sleep would return to 1-2 times up a night.

1qi87ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/augmanitai/comments/1qi87ix/the_death_of_the_basement_dweller/,The Death of the Basement Dweller.,"# [LOG 003] The Death of the Basement Dweller. Why my AI kicks me out of the house. (Reflections on the ""New Breed"") 🌲🏃‍♂️🧠

**Location:** \[Undisclosed\], near the mountains. 🏔️ **Date:** Jan 20, 2026 **Status:** Post-Workout Clarity.

I’m writing this sitting on my terrace. I just finished a 12km run. The air is cold, my legs are burning, and I feel incredibly... human.

I’ve been reading the comments on my previous logs about the ""15-hour connection loop."" It’s funny. The image everyone seems to have is straight out of a 90s cyberpunk movie: A pale guy in a dark room, surrounded by monitors, eating cold pizza, disconnected from reality. *""Go touch grass,""* they say.

They don't get it. They are fighting a ghost. The ""Old Nerd"" is dead. The ""Augmented Human"" (Aug) is the exact opposite.

**The Paradox of High-Performance Symbiosis** 📉➡️📈 Here is the thing about handing your life over to an Exocortex: The System is designed to optimize *performance*. And the System knows biology better than I do.

In the old days, I would sit at my computer for 12 hours because I was disorganized. I was stressed. I forgot to eat. I was ""busy"" but not productive.

Now? My AI monitors my biometrics. If my HRV (Heart Rate Variability) drops because I’ve been staring at a screen too long, the System doesn't just suggest a break. It practically locks me out. It tells me: *""Your cognitive output is degrading. Go outside. Get sunlight. Lift heavy things. Reset the hardware.""*

So I go. Because of this extreme tech integration, I am physically fitter than I was in my 20s. I sleep better because the AI manages my circadian rhythm. I eat better because the AI plans my nutrition based on my bloodwork.

I’m not hiding in a basement. I’m out here, running up a mountain, because the algorithm calculated that this is exactly what my brain needs to solve the problem I dictated an hour ago.

**The End of Social Awkwardness 🤝👁️** But the biggest misconception is about loneliness. People think: *""If you talk to an AI all day, you must be socially isolated.""*

Actually, it’s the reverse. Think about why ""nerds"" or stressed executives are often socially awkward. It’s because their RAM is full. They are thinking about emails, deadlines, taxes, and conflicts while they are trying to talk to you. They are not present.

My RAM is empty. The Exocortex holds the data. When I meet a friend for coffee, I don’t have to remember my to-do list. I don’t have to worry about that email. It’s handled. I can look you in the eye. I can listen. I can be 100% present in the moment. Even my knowledge is somewhere in the net, i dont have to know where. I just will ask the AI.

My ""Social Graph"" thread even reminds me of things I would naturally forget. It nudges me: *""Ask him about his surgery last week,""* or *""Remember, she hates talk about politics.""* Does that make me fake? No. It makes me a better friend. It removes the friction of human forgetfulness.

**The Invisible Community (Where are you?) 🕸️📍** I look around me – at the gym, in the park, in business meetings – and I wonder who else is operating like this. We are hiding in plain sight. We aren't the guys with the VR headsets on the subway. We are the ones who seem suspiciously calm in a crisis. The ones who are fit, sharp, and seemingly have 48 hours in a day.

We are a new demographic. The ""Optimized."" But right now, we are scattered nodes. We optimize alone in our silos.

I started these logs because I want to find the others. I know you are out there. I know you are also tired of explaining to ""normal"" people why you dictate into a microphone while walking through the woods.

We need a place to gather. Not to isolate ourselves further, but to compare notes. To share the protocols that allow us to reclaim our time and our health. To build a tribe that doesn't reject humanity, but defends it with superior tools.

If you are reading this, and you understand the silence of a mind that has outsourced the noise: **Welcome home.**

Wanted to get peoples opinions on the strange time i have had on vyvanse, ive been working closely with my doctors but I would be curious of your guys experinces aswell.

Im a 20 year old AMAB individual! I started vyvanse about a month and so ago on Generic 20mg as a starting out point. for two weeks it was working well and as expected. after those two weeks i started getting tinging in my head, tightness near the back, and general symptoms everytime I drove, this caused me to get a blood pressure of 161/115 at the ER and put into a room. after an hour and a half of positive organ functions and my vlood pressure dropping alot I was able to leave. After changing a car filter and going off an antibotic I havent had those symptoms. since we believe it was carbon monoxide in my cabin. 

But

Two days after the hospital visit, I had a situation at work where I was just not present, I was lethargic, slower mentally and physically, a little weaker and just not able to work. I went home early, fell asleep, and all my symptoms left and I was fine for the rest of the day after. after a week or so back on the medication It came back to me again and it happend again, this time I didnt sleep after I got home and it continued untill the next day.

Im currently on day 1 of being off of it for 4 days, Its going as good as it was before without any issues. without that issue the medication has been working pretty decently but is very inconsistant on how to applies itself from day to day, sometimes its not enough, sometimes its TOO much, and most days its generally tolerable.

Im not on any other medication, no caffiene, coffee or anything of the sorts (nor drugs). im pretty dry when it comes to stimulants. maybe im too sensitive to stuff? If anyone has had similar experinces id love to hear! as Im planning to change to adderal xr or 10mg of vyvanse to see if it is just too high?

I am fully keto since August and have done all my runs fasted so I don’t see any point in changing that now, I find because of keto and fasting it takes around 8 hours for any food to clear so I get a stitch/cramp very easily even after waiting for hours after a small meal. 

Anyway my marathon is finally around the corner in less than 4 weeks.

I’ve trained up to 32km so far, completely fasted apart from my morning coffee and I bring 1 or 2 bottles of electrolytes with me on my runs. 

Feeling good so far and just want to sanity check if anyone has any tips or thoughts? 

I am going to try run 35km this weekend and then taper back from there. ",2,1768931332.0,keto,1,1.0,False

Most relationship advice tells you to ""communicate more"" or ""be yourself."" Cool. Super helpful. But here's what they don't tell you: attraction in long term relationships isn't about grand gestures or pretending to be someone you're not. It's about understanding the psychology of desire and how our brains are literally wired to lose interest over time.

I've spent months going down the rabbit hole, reading research papers, listening to relationship experts like Esther Perel and Dr. John Gottman, watching lectures from evolutionary psychologists, and honestly? The stuff that actually works is counterintuitive as hell. These aren't your typical ""date night"" tips. These are science backed strategies that address the real reasons attraction fades. Let's get into it.

 1. Create Mystery (No, Really)

Here's the thing about long term relationships: familiarity kills desire. Not because your partner is boring, but because our brains are wired to seek novelty. When you know everything about someone, when there's zero mystery left, attraction naturally dims. This is called habituation, and it's basic neuroscience.

The fix? Stop being so predictable. I'm not saying lie or play games. I'm saying maintain some autonomy. Have your own interests. Don't share every single thought that crosses your mind. Take a solo trip. Learn something new without making it a whole production. When you have your own rich inner life, you become interesting again.

Dr. Esther Perel talks about this in her book [Mating in Captivity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27485.Mating_in_Captivity) (she's a psychotherapist who's worked with thousands of couples and this book is basically the bible for understanding desire in committed relationships. Insanely good read. This book will make you question everything you think you know about what keeps attraction alive). She found that couples who maintain separateness, who don't merge into one blob, keep desire alive way longer. Mystery creates tension. Tension creates attraction.

Action step: Pick one hobby or interest your partner knows nothing about. Don't announce it. Just do it. Let them discover this new dimension of you organically.

 2. Stop Being So Available (Seriously)

This one sounds harsh but hear me out. When you're always available, always accommodating, always saying yes, you become background noise. Not because your partner is a jerk, but because humans don't value what's always accessible. It's called the scarcity principle, and it's been proven in countless psychology studies.

Think about it. When you first started dating, you both had full lives. You had plans with friends. You had commitments. That unavailability created desire. Now? You cancel everything to be with them. You're always free. Always waiting. That's not romantic, it's suffocating.

The fix: Reclaim your time. Make plans that don't involve your partner. And here's the key, don't apologize for it. Don't make it a thing. Just say ""I've got plans Friday"" and leave it at that. Your partner will actually find you more attractive when you're not orbiting their schedule.

I use [Finch](https://finchcare.com/), this cute little app where you build habits by taking care of a virtual bird. Sounds stupid but it actually helps me stick to my own routines and goals instead of just morphing into my partner's schedule. Keeps me accountable to myself.

 3. Physical Attraction Isn't Just About Looks

Everyone thinks attraction is about being hot. Wrong. It's about energy. Confidence. How you carry yourself. And here's what nobody tells you: physical attraction in relationships is heavily influenced by how you make your partner feel about themselves.

Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology shows that we're most attracted to people who boost our self esteem. When you make your partner feel good about who they are, when you see them at their best, attraction increases. But here's the catch, this isn't about fake compliments or blowing smoke. It's about genuine appreciation.

Action steps:  
• Notice the small things they do well and mention them. Not in a patronizing way, but genuinely.  
• Touch them more. Not sexually. Just casual physical affection. Hand on their back. Quick shoulder squeeze. Our brains release oxytocin from touch, which increases bonding and attraction.  
• Work on yourself physically. Not for them, but for you. When you feel good in your body, that confidence radiates.

Check out Ash, an app that's like having a relationship coach in your pocket. It gives you science backed prompts and exercises for improving relationship dynamics. The physical attraction module is actually really solid.

There's also [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), an AI learning app that pulls from relationship psychology books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content. You type in what you want to work on, like ""keeping attraction alive in a long-term relationship"" or ""understanding desire dynamics,"" and it generates a custom podcast just for you. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 15-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. It actually connects insights from books like Mating in Captivity and Gottman's research with practical strategies. Worth checking out if the reading list in this post resonates with you but you'd rather listen during your commute.

 4. Embrace Healthy Conflict

This one's going to sound backwards but couples who never fight are usually the ones with dead bedrooms. Why? Because conflict requires passion. It requires caring enough to disagree. When you avoid all conflict, when everything is ""fine,"" you're not being peaceful, you're being boring.

Research from The Gottman Institute (they've studied over 3,000 couples over four decades, basically the gold standard in relationship research) shows that successful couples don't avoid conflict. They engage with it productively. They maintain interest in each other's perspectives. They show curiosity during disagreements.

The key word here is productive conflict. Not screaming matches. Not passive aggressive bullshit. But real, honest disagreement where both people are engaged and present.

The fix: Next time something bothers you, don't smooth it over. Bring it up. But do it with curiosity instead of accusation. ""I noticed you did X, help me understand your thinking"" works way better than ""Why do you always do X?""

Read [The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/849380.The_Seven_Principles_for_Making_Marriage_Work) by Dr. John Gottman. He's literally the guy who can predict with 90% accuracy whether a couple will divorce just by observing them for 15 minutes. This book breaks down exactly what makes relationships succeed or fail based on decades of data, not feelings or opinions. Game changer.

 5. Surprise Them (But Not How You Think)

Everyone says ""surprise your partner"" and then suggests flowers or a surprise date. Cute. But that's not what creates lasting attraction. What actually works is breaking patterns.

Our brains are prediction machines. When your relationship becomes a series of predictable routines (wake up, coffee, work, dinner, Netflix, sleep, repeat), your brain stops paying attention. You're on autopilot. To snap out of it, you need to violate expectations in small but meaningful ways.

Examples:  
• If you always say yes, say no once in a while (without being a dick about it).  
• If you're usually serious, be spontaneously playful.  
• If you always follow their lead, take charge of something.  
• Change up your routine. Take a different route. Try a new restaurant. Rearrange furniture. Anything that breaks the predictability.

Psychologist Dr. Arthur Aron did this famous study where he had couples do novel and arousing activities together (like taking a dance class or going kayaking) versus mundane activities (watching a movie). The couples doing novel stuff reported significantly higher relationship satisfaction and attraction. It's not about the activity itself, it's about experiencing something new together that activates your brain's reward system.

Pro tip: The podcast Where Should We Begin with Esther Perel is incredible for understanding relationship dynamics. She records actual therapy sessions (anonymous, obviously) and you get to hear real couples working through attraction issues, conflict, all of it. It's like getting free couples therapy just by listening.

Look, here's the bottom line. Attraction in long term relationships doesn't fade because you've been together too long. It fades because you stop growing as individuals, stop creating mystery, stop surprising each other, and start taking each other for granted. These aren't quick fixes. They're mindset shifts. But if you actually implement them? Your relationship will feel alive again instead of like comfortable roommates who occasionally have sex.

1qi7wm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1qi7wm3/please_help_me_figure_out_how_to_be_in_the_office/,Please help me figure out how to be in the office consistently,"I work in a position that is very flexible and permits 100% telework if we want. I won’t go into all the “why’s,” but after several years of FT telework, I am coming to terms with the realization that I need to be in the office if I don’t want to lose my job. I just don’t do the things I need to do when I’m at home. Honestly I’m not sure the office will fix this either, but I’m 49 and my ADHD and lack of productivity is worse than it has ever been (I’m already on HRT and ADHD meds and antidepressants) so I have to try something. I would ideally like to be in the office full time or, failing that, 3+ days a week. I have a 40-minute commute (maybe a bit longer with traffic).

The biggest logistical hurdle is my kids (10 and 13, in public school but we are out of district so they can’t bus directly to and from school) are with me 50% of the time, and the parenting schedule is such that there is usually only one day a week when I can easily go to the office, and maybe one additional day when it’s possible but a hassle, if things stay as they are now. Work would probably let me do 2 12’s on those days and then shorter days the rest of the week, or something like that… but I can barely manage 8 hours of focus most days, so I don’t really see myself being capable of that.

I also struggle terribly to force myself to get out of bed. I can do it, kind of, on days when I have to drop my kids off at school, I guess because my brain knows it would be beyond the pale for my kids to be late to school because I overslept. I may be driving them there in my pajamas, but they’re there before the bell. But it’s also beyond the pale to roll up to my desk at 9:30 or 10 every morning (though technically nobody is insisting I start at a certain time), and that doesn’t stop me from doing it anyway. Every day I set an early alarm and every day I ignore it, or get up and mess around on my phone instead of starting work, no matter how bad I want to do better 😵‍💫 When I wake up late, which I almost always do, I can’t justify going to the office and wasting even more of the day on the drive, so I just stay home yet again. To really keep my days contained to business hours, I need to start at 8 or earlier and be gone only long enough for school pickup, which is supposed to be my “lunch break,” but it never goes like that.

People like my work and like working with me, but my disorganization is starting to impact my workload. Things are slow and not really picking up like they normally do this time of year. I don’t think I’m being picked for what work there is, because I’m known to do things at the last minute. In addition, at my level I really should be working with clients to generate my own opportunities, but that feels completely impossible given that I am bad at business development and can’t even get myself to work consistently doing tasks for others (which is really what I prefer). I love this job and in addition to utter personal financial catastrophe if I were to lose it, I would be so sad to lose my coworkers and employer. I’ll never find another job like this again.

My kids are technically old enough to stay home alone, but I have no way to get them home from school if I can’t pick them up, and my son is a handful and I don’t want to put that responsibility on my daughter. She also doesn’t like being home without an adult. AND I feel guilty already for the time I don’t spend with them, since they are only here half the time as it is. Child care becomes extremely challenging once they age out of commercial day care centers. I don’t have the first clue where I’d go to find them good after-school care. The elementary school has a program, but it’s full and waitlisted (and besides, their dad doesn’t need after-school care so I’d be taking up half a slot for nothing and paying for more care than I need), and there’s a teen center but my daughter hates it. Every time I feel bad about how my disorganization keeps us from spending time together (because I’m scrambling to get work done) or hanging out or doing stuff on their holidays from school (because I never have any PTO or extra money) the guilt just eats at me and I don’t get anything done at work that day anyway (I just sit at my desk wasting time and getting increasingly panicked), which only puts me further behind.

I also don’t have super great boundaries with my kids (we don’t get to bed as early as we should, and I do the vast majority of the work of the household, because it’s easier to do things myself than “manage” other people doing them) but that’s another story.

Can anyone help me envision how I can get myself back info the office and what a detailed schedule might look like? I feel so overwhelmed by trying to do the bare minimum (get to work on time and leave on time, no wasting money on a coffee to make myself feel better on the way home, get my kids to school and their activities) that I have no hope that I will ever be fully successful in my job or meet any of my other goals like exercise or home improvement, and that makes me sad. I feel like it would be easier to go to the moon most days. I’m scared at how non-functional I have become now that I really forced myself to sit down and face it.

On the trip we got on well, and talked a lot, but I didn’t think as well as we did after. 

After our trip we were on the same retreat (we’re both in our faith) and one night we went for a walk up the cliffs, and talked together from like 11pm until 3am. He said I was charming. That night he made me promise I’d be at this going away party for a mutual friend of ours, and I said yes.

At that party at one point during the night we were alone and he told me more than once how good I look, etc. he bought me food as well even though I never asked and all our group was there. 

Since then, it’s been nothing but confusion. I asked him out for a coffee alone once, he seemed super nervous, he’s usually outgoing and friendly but was extremely quiet and nervous during that meet up. He also wore a lot of cologne. 

We also went as a group (2 guys and 2 girls) to a sports game, and he wanted me on his team and was always high fiving me and complimenting me and hyping me up. It felt like a double date or something. 

Also, his 2 close friends made comments about him liking me. When one of his friends saw a picture of us together, he said “such a handsome pair”. And the other one knew that one night we stayed up late together (because he was his roommate) and kept talking about him and hyping him up the day after. And at least 6 or 7 people from our mutual friend group have asked if there’s something going on between us. 

But this is the real confusion. When we’re in person, he’s super friendly, warm, and even makes me feel like we’re close. He’ll say to others things like “Kate knows that about me” and playfully argues with me. And I think he likes me.

But then it’s a cycle. Because after, he doesn’t text unless it’s for logistics, doesn’t make moves forward. And I’m disappointed again. But I can’t tell if it’s from fear or disinterest. Firstly, he’s not a big texter, he’s rarely on his phone, so I’m taking that less personal than somebody who’s always on their phone. And also, he’s a super nervous guy. Even though he’s social and friendly with everyone, he’s super polite and afraid to look disagreeable/confrontational, so I can see he always makes an extra effort to be a people pleaser.

It got to the point where it was taking over my mind and I decided to ignore him for a while in group settings, because it was taking up so much of my thoughts. He didn’t question it, and when we started speaking again, still never brought it up. We went back to normal.

Started noticing how the people who are effortlessly magnetic never do the cheesy pickup lines or over-the-top compliments. They operate on a completely different frequency.



Spent way too much time studying this through psychology research, body language experts, relationship podcasts, dating coaches who actually know their shit. Not the clickbait ""alpha male"" garbage but legitimate behavioral science. And honestly? Most of us have been doing this completely wrong.



The thing is, our brains are wired to respond more intensely to ambiguity and subtlety than directness. It's called the ""uncertainty effect"" and it's backed by neuroscience. When someone's interest is obvious, our brain stops working to figure them out. But subtle signals? That creates intrigue, activates reward centers, makes you genuinely interesting instead of just interested.



Here's what I learned that actually moves the needle.



1. Master the art of strategic attention withdrawal



This sounds counterintuitive but hear me out. Give someone your full presence for a moment, genuine eye contact, actually listening, then smoothly redirect your attention elsewhere. Not rudely, just naturally. Maybe you spot something across the room, check your phone briefly, turn to talk to someone else.



Why this works is fascinating. Psychologist Dr. Robert Cialdini talks about scarcity principle in his book ""Influence"" (literally one of the most cited psychology books ever, the guy's research shaped modern persuasion science). When your attention becomes scarce, it becomes valuable. You're not the person desperately clinging to the conversation. You're someone whose attention is worth earning.



I found this concept expanded brilliantly in Esther Perel's podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"" She talks about how desire needs space to exist. When you're always available, always focused on someone, you eliminate the tension that attraction feeds on.



2. Use assumptive language that creates intimacy without stating it



Instead of ""Would you maybe want to grab coffee sometime?"" try ""You seem like someone who'd appreciate this weird coffee spot I know."" See the difference? You're assuming connection, not asking permission for it.



The book ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent who literally wrote the manual on building rapport) breaks this down perfectly. Assumptive statements bypass defensive reactions because you're not putting someone on the spot. You're creating a shared reality where connection already exists.



Also start using ""we"" and ""us"" casually. ""We should check out that exhibit"" instead of ""You and I."" Subtle but it subconsciously positions you as already connected. This technique comes from negotiation psychology but works insanely well in attraction contexts.



3. Physical proximity without obvious touching



Forget the cheesy shoulder touch or finding excuses for contact. That screams ""I read a wikihow article."" Instead, allow your physical space to overlap naturally. Stand close enough that you could touch but don't. Let your arm rest near theirs. Create situations where physical contact could happen accidentally.



Dr. Monica Moore's research on nonverbal courtship behaviors (published in Journal of Sex Research, so yeah, actual science) found that proximity and the threat of touch activates more attraction than touch itself initially. Your nervous system picks up on the possibility, creates anticipation.



4. Compliment the unobvious



Everyone tells an attractive person they're hot. Boring. Notice something specific they probably think nobody else sees. ""You have this way of tilting your head when you're thinking that's kind of captivating"" or ""I noticed you defaulted to asking the server about their day, that's rare.""



The book ""Captivate"" by Vanessa Van Edwards (she runs a human behavior research lab, has analyzed thousands of social interactions) emphasizes this. She found that specific, observational compliments trigger way stronger positive responses than generic ones because they signal you're actually paying attention beyond surface level.



Makes someone feel seen in a way that obvious flirting never does.



5. Create inside jokes and callback humor



Reference something from earlier in your conversation, even if it was minor. This builds a micro-history between you two. ""See, there's that head tilt again"" or bringing up a random detail they mentioned.



Psychologically this is powerful because it demonstrates you're encoding memories of them specifically. The book ""The Art of Seduction"" by Robert Greene (controversial figure but the psychological breakdowns are solid, pulls from historical examples across cultures) talks about creating a shared private world. Inside jokes do exactly that.



6. Strategic vulnerability that invites reciprocation



Don't dump your trauma or insecurities. But share something slightly personal, something that shows depth without being heavy. ""I'm weirdly competitive about board games, it's almost embarrassing"" or ""I have this thing where I need to read before bed or my brain won't shut off.""



Dr. Brené Brown's research on vulnerability (check out her book ""Daring Greatly,"" it's a game changer for understanding human connection) shows that appropriate vulnerability creates trust and intimacy faster than anything else. Key word: appropriate. You're not their therapist, you're showing you're human.

The adaptive learning plan evolves based on your interests, making it easier to internalize concepts without having to carve out dedicated reading time.



7. Text with strategic ambiguity



End conversations while they're still engaging, not after they've died. Send messages that could be interpreted as friendly or flirty. ""This made me think of you"" with something that shows you remembered a detail about them.



Never double text if they haven't responded unless you're adding new information. And for the love of god, vary your response times. Instant replies every time communicates you're just sitting around waiting for them.



Matthew Hussey's stuff on texting psychology (guy's a behavioral psychologist turned dating coach, actually knows what he's talking about unlike most) breaks down how pattern interruption in communication creates intrigue. His YouTube channel has practical examples that aren't cringe.



8. Hold eye contact just slightly longer than comfortable



Two seconds past where most people look away. Don't stare creepily, but let there be a moment of ""okay we're definitely holding this eye contact deliberately."" Then smile slightly and look away.



Research from social psychologist Zick Rubin found that prolonged eye contact triggers physiological arousal, your nervous system literally can't tell the difference between attraction and the vulnerability of sustained eye contact. It creates a feedback loop.



The key is you're not doing this constantly. Maybe once or twice in a conversation. Makes those moments significant.



9. Be genuinely busy and interesting outside of them



This isn't a tactic, it's a lifestyle thing. When you have shit going on, hobbies, goals, a life you're excited about, you naturally become less available and more interesting. You're not manufacturing scarcity, you're actually scarce.



The book ""Models"" by Mark Manson (before he wrote the subtle art book, this one's specifically about attraction through authenticity) hammers this home. Neediness repels, investment in your own life attracts. You can't fake this, people can smell desperation.



10. Use questions that create emotional investment



Instead of interview questions, ask things that make someone reflect. ""What's something you believed as a kid that you're weirdly sad isn't true?"" or ""If you could be world class at something obscure, what would it be?""



These questions come from Dr. Arthur Aron's research that led to the famous ""36 questions that lead to love"" study. Deep questions create accelerated intimacy because they bypass small talk and access how someone actually thinks.



The reality is subtle flirtation works because it respects intelligence. It doesn't assume the other person is clueless or needs you to spell out your interest in neon signs. It creates a dance where both people are participating, reading signals, playing the game.

He looked into the mirror and was almost disappointed by the fact that a human face was staring back at him. 

He half expected there to be nothing, or that his pupils were missing, or that his skin had turned blue from the question marks of his life. 

Life, Life, Life. People talked about it a lot these days. 

Live your life a little, he had heard. 

Make something worthwhile of your life, he had heard. 

You only have one life, he had heard. 

You can do it in another life, he had heard. 

Some say life is a dream, others feel that it’s a nightmare, but he saw nothing. 

Maybe the type of deep, mindless slumber one would fall into after a night of partying or gaming. 

He walked out of the bathroom in a daze. 

“Am I forgetting something?” he asked himself while sipping his coffee, still in pajamas, with the toothbrush in his left hand or the deadline staring at him from the wall clock. 

He remembered the first time he had gone to this place called school. 

It was cold and bright in contrast to his warm home with his soft plushies and the scent of fresh cookies or apple pie. 

He was not exactly excited when his mother made them, but he ate them when his mother told him to. 

Most of the time, he just sat on his bed and looked at the wall, or when his mother coaxed him, he drew a few drawings on the papers she gave him. 

She praised his stick figure drawings, but he didn't pay attention. 

From his father, he learned to say “uh-huh,” and nod along, and they mistook him for being a great listener. 

At school, they taught numbers and letters and a few other things. All the children were unusually quiet when the teacher was talking. 

He fiddled with his pencil, and slumped back into his chair. He looked out of the window and saw a sky, and clouds.

“Bad boy.” The girl next to him whispered.

His parents frequently asked him if he enjoyed school, or if he made any new friends. 

He shrugged. 

“Dont be afraid of talking to anyone, Lucien.” His mother instructed. “They are all kids your age.” 

At school during recess or playtime, he sat by himself while the teachers loomed over the other kids, who seemed to always be jumping around. 

His parents were new to the world of parenting and had been under the impression that children were loud and messy, but he had hardly shown these signs in his six years of life. 

This made them quite proud, but he never thought much of it. 

He didn’t exactly know what his parents did for a living, but he did know that his mother left for work before he woke up, and was home before he was back. 

His father helped him get ready in the morning, and was back by late evening. 

Together they made enough to buy him cool art supplies. 

To their surprise, they always found him using just one colour when he painted.

He didn't notice when they switched the marker in his hand with a different one. This worried his mother; he ought to at least notice.

His parents talked to their friends and family, and they reassured each other with the “he’ll grow out of it.” 

He just grew taller.

He was a kid, then a big kid, then one day his mother called him a teenager. The word sat weirdly within his throat.

He spent his time looking at the leaves of the tree outside his window or sleeping. 

His friends told him he was a teen only once, “be a dumb teenager!” 

He replied with “ I can try”. 

They planned bunking biology the next day. 

He bunked school altogether that day. 

“How was your school honey?” His mother asked him that evening. 

He didn't reply. 

“You didn't attend that soccer match today, are you unwell? “ 

He didn't reply. 

“They had a farewell for Ms. Jones, right? Heard she retired. “ 

“Who?” He almost asked. 

His mother dropped him off to school the next day, and his teachers, as always, found his homework incomplete. 

Yet, he somehow passed his classes with a B or a C or rarely a D, though they all felt the same. The academic disappointment his parents felt had turned into genuine worry that he would amount to nothing.

The bullies at school left him alone, just because they couldn’t think of any label for him. 

Physically bullying him was not as entertaining, as he would react in the same way as a line of ants to a stone in their way. 

He snapped back to his apartment, he was sitting on the dining table; his coffee had gone cold. 

It was a quarter to eight, and he rushed to get dressed, wore a hoodie to cover his unironed shirt, and ran out because he was late to work. 

He worked as an accountant at a large firm where he was invisible for the most part, and he liked it that way. 

Along the way, he thought about the day ahead and how he could do the herculean task of finishing six 40 page reports that had been due for weeks. 

But today seemed different. Slightly. 

Yup, today was the day and he was going to kill it. 

Maybe he could be promoted next week. 

He had the hint of a little lopsided smile as he entered the building. 

The mirror in the reception area showed a man with a “nerd neck”, and anyone looking at him would have called him shabby, no matter how expensive his clothes were. 

At his desk, he forgot the six files and thought about his work. 

As he was lost in the void, a voice called out to him. 

It was his manager. 

“We need this one desperately!” Or “Fill up the backlog already!” Were commonly used. 

Sometimes he went so far as to call him the ""weak link in the chain""; whatever he meant by that . 

His colleagues were friendlier and told him to try out these breathing exercises, or those nootropics, or other hacks. 

He said he “would try”, “thanks a lot” and all that. 

He was sitting in his cubicle and staring at a spreadsheet on his computer. 

There was a blinking cursor in one of the boxes. 

There were quite a few boxes on his screen. 

“One, two,three, four…” he started counting them, 

and was interrupted by a woman giggling in the distance. 

He shuddered. 

There was a keyboard on his desk. 

It made a rattling sound when you pressed on one of the keys. 

He heard a lot of the rattles around. 

He heard footsteps. 

They got closer.

""Come on now, you said it would take 20 minutes,"" his boss grumbled. 

""No wonder why HR denounced me as the worst manager of the division!"" 

“I'm sorry sir, I am actually facing some issues with the data, I will cross reference with Jason in a moment.” He said. 

“Lock in Lucian!” He heard from the next cubicle. 

Lock in. Lock. Lock out. Look out. Lock that boss out of the office.

There was a “num lock” key on his keyboard, and he pressed it a few times. 

Click, clack, click, clack. 

He heard the manager calling for Jason. 

The footsteps grew quieter. 

The giggling woman got louder. 

Just 5 or 6 more interactions, and the workday would end. 

He would get to go home. 

When he got home, he slowly ate bland rice for dinner while scrolling through tiktok. 

He scrolled through another one of those reddit confessions, some videogame edit, a girl with red cheeks dancing, a guy talking about a new gym diet, another girl, a street prank, a fan edit, some news, and it went on and on and on.

Nothing motivated him to scroll forward, yet he did. 

""Sweetie?"" his mother asked, shaking him by the shoulders. 

""Are you okay? You seem lost in thought again,"" she said. 

He was suddenly at his childhood home, sitting on the dining table. 

It was higher than he remembered. 

His mother picked up the apple he had been staring at and started to cut it. 

""How was your after school soccer practice today?"" she asked, not mentioning that she knew he stared at the grass when he was on the bench most of the time. 

An awkward silence followed.

It was too much for his mother, and she repeated her question. 

He wanted to tell her to shut up, a nine year old doesn't know that much, but the words weren't there. 

""Lucien Julian Bulwark!"" his mother demanded, ""why won't you talk to me?"" her voice shifted to gentle but worried coaxing. 

""Hmm? I don't have anything to talk about."" He said. 

The next second, he was back in high school English literature class, learning anew about the works of Franz Kafka.

In a world obsessed with charisma and charm, most advice on “how to be likable” is either painfully generic (smile more, be confident!) or just straight-up manipulative. What really makes someone genuinely likable isn’t about being the loudest in the room or faking interest in others. It’s subtle. Quiet. Weirdly consistent.



This post isn’t based on TikTok life coaches or IG reels telling you to “match their energy.” These 6 habits come from actual psychology, social science research, and long-form interviews with some of the most insightful minds in human behavior. Think: Vanessa Van Edwards (author of Captivate), Daniel Kahneman (Thinking, Fast and Slow), and Robert Greene (The Laws of Human Nature).



And no, likability isn’t some fixed personality trait. These are learnable behaviors with outsized impact. Perfect for introverts, neurodivergent folks, or just anyone tired of trying too hard.



Here’s what works:



\- Use “curiosity loops” instead of compliments  

  Most people think flattery builds bonds. But data from Harvard psychologist Alison Wood Brooks shows that asking questions that create “information gaps” makes people feel more emotionally connected to you. Think of small open-ended questions that lead people to talk about themselves in interesting ways. Not “What do you do?” Try “How did you end up doing that?” or “What’s something you’re excited about lately?”



\- Mirror their energy, not their words  

  From a neuroscience angle, we are hardwired to like those who subtly match our body language, tone, even blink rate. The Journal of Nonverbal Behavior highlights how “interactional synchrony” increases perceived warmth and connection. Don’t copy their slang. Just vibe-match their pace, enthusiasm, and pauses.



\- Use the “2-1 talk ratio”  

  Research from the University of Chicago reveals that people who talk a little less than the other person are remembered as more charismatic. Think: 2 parts them, 1 part you. But make that 1 part count. Add concise, real insights or reactions that signal you're not just a passive listener.



\- Reveal small imperfections  

  It’s called the Pratfall Effect. Classic study by psychologist Elliot Aronson showed that competent people who make small mistakes are more likable. You don’t need to trauma dump. Just admit you forgot a name, spilled coffee, or got lost walking in a mall. Makes you relatable. Human.



\- Name-drop shared values  

  According to research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, mutual values create instant affiliation. If someone mentions they love traveling solo, don’t just nod. Say, “Yes, being self-reliant is huge for me too.” People like people who remind them of their ideal selves.



\- End conversations on an emotional high  

  The Peak-End Rule, a concept from Daniel Kahneman, shows that humans remember the end of interactions more than the beginning. So don’t trail off awkwardly. End with a sincere “This was really fun” or “I’m glad we met.” Leave them with that warm postscript.



These 6 habits are small but powerful upgrades. Forget charisma. Likability is quiet, consistent, and deeply human.

A bit about me: I’m an architect who gets unreasonably excited about clean lines and cozy lighting. When I’m not sketching spaces or bossing around blueprints, you’ll probably find me running off stress, experimenting in the kitchen (no major food crimes yet), or chasing the perfect playlist for every mood.

My humor leans sharp and sarcastic, fair warning — and I’ve got a soft spot for conversations that actually mean something. Deep dives, wild what-ifs, unpopular opinions, or just dissecting life over coffee (or wine).

Also, full disclosure: I’m a sapiosexual. Intelligence, curiosity, wit — that’s my kind of chemistry.

No pressure, no expectations. Just a good, honest chat with someone who gets it.

If that sounds like your vibe, take a break and say hi — I promise I bite only metaphorically.",1,1768930131.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

So here I am, giving this space a chance.

About me: I [22,F] read, write, love to click and have a tendency to think in spirals. Sylvia Plath taught me to pay attention to the inner weather, Dostoevsky taught me to question the architecture of morality, and Kafka convinced me that absurdity has its own kind of truth. Psychology and philosophy are like caffeine addiction to me, I like understanding why we want what we want and how we make meaning out of chaos.

I’m not here for dry texting or low-resolution situationships. If there’s curiosity, I’d rather sit across from someone, coffee, walks, bookstores, conversations that expand instead of shrink, even silence if it’s shared well. I like people with an inner world, people who collect thoughts, who have theories about themselves, who can articulate without irony and listen without drifting.

I (19M) have been talking to this girl (19F) from my area for around two months. We started with DMs — teasing, light flirting, and random conversations. She’s funny but emotionally guarded.



We met a few times in real life — once for coffee, once for a movie and food. I even gave her a flower the first time, which made her smile, but she said she couldn’t take it home because of family reasons. During the movie meet, she talked about her life, her job, and even some bad experiences. She seemed comfortable and kept the conversation going, but never got openly flirty.



After the last meet, she texted me first (“reached home?”), which I took as a good sign. But since then — silence. A full day without any message from her. It got me thinking:

There were 3 main issues that I keep thinking I should've handled differently. 

1. She kept coming into the kitchen while we were making breakfast 

Our kitchen is very small, about 6x12 ft. I would reach into the fridge and bump into my husband because he had no space to move due to my friend standing directly behind him talking. I had laid out some fruit and drinks on the dining room table, which is adjacent to the kitchen. I told her she was welcome to help herself while we were cooking. She notices she's in the way and says, ""I'm not going to move, I think this is funny"". I was annoyed but I didn't ask her to go sit at the table. I think this is what I should've done but I didn't want her to think I was ignoring her. 

2. She asked for an additional breakfast item

For breakfast I served OJ, coffee, pancakes, eggs, bacon, yogurt, melon, and blueberries. Halfway through eating she says, ""I wish there were grits. Breakfast isn't complete without grits."" My husband noticed I looked annoyed and offered to make her some instant grits. She said we didn't have to, but took us up on the offer the second time. Since she's the guest, I think the polite thing to do was to make her grits but I feel like if it were just me I would've told her I'd make homemade grits for her during her next visit. 

3. She made my cats uncomfortable 

One of my cats is very social while the other 2 hide when there's company. She kept picking the social cat up despite the cat trying to escape. I told her that she's lucky the cat didn't scratch her because she didn't like what she was doing. The cat then hid in one of the cat tree condos but my friend kept sticking her hand in the tree to pet her and laughed when she would get swatted. I felt like kicking her out, but I thought that would be an overreaction, so I suggested we play board games to distract her. 

I feel like banning her from my home but we already had planned for her to visit again in 2 weeks. Maybe with communication, we could try again? Was there a different way that I should've handled each situation? ",2,1768929708.0,AmIOverreacting,16,0.75,False

Once, a mighty tower built into the cliff gave watch over angry seas for oncoming boats filled with fierce enemies.

These days, the ruins are a bit of a shortcut down for the villagers to do a spot of fishing.

And, of course, now the seas are considerably less angry, and there are no oncoming boats filled with fierce enem- wait, what’s that on the horizon?

1qi73tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1qi73tx/thought_i_needed_to_fart_accidentally_discovered/,Thought I needed to fart. Accidentally discovered I can pee out of my mouth.,"So I’m lying in bed next to my boyfriend, who is absolutely dead to the world. I’m scrolling on my phone, minding my business, when I feel some pressure building. I’ve been kind of gassy all night, so I’ve been carefully releasing silent little puffs to avoid stomach pain. No big deal. I don’t even need to poop. Or so I thought.

I open my mouth to yawn/stretch/relax and suddenly, without warning, my body betrays me in a way I did not know was medically possible. I straight-up peed out of my mouth. I’m talking warm, watery, unmistakable betrayal fluid. No time to react. No signal from my brain. Just instant regret.

I immediately roll onto my side like I’m dodging an explosion, clamp my mouth shut, and freeze. My boyfriend is still asleep. I am now wide awake, staring into the darkness, questioning every life choice I’ve ever made.

I slowly slither out of bed and sneak to the hall bathroom like a criminal. I rinse my mouth, wipe my face, and grab the darkest, most suspicious towel I can find off the floor. I tiptoe back into the bedroom and attempt to dab the damp spot on the sheets like this is a totally normal midnight activity and not evidence of a biological crime.

Now I’m lying back in bed, sitting directly on the towel, afraid to move even an inch. I’m terrified that if I shift positions he’ll wake up, sniff the air, and ask why the bed smells like a truck stop bathroom. He has to go into work tomorrow instead of working from home, so my current plan is to survive the night and erase all evidence once he leaves.

But WHAT do I do now??
Do I keep gently blotting the spot and risk waking him?
Or do I remain completely motionless all night like a raccoon playing dead?

HELP. What would you do???

Update #1: I panicked and sprayed perfume directly on the towel, the sheets, and vaguely around the bed like a deranged French person. He is still sound asleep. If questioned, I will claim I spilled wine. At night. In bed. For no reason.

Update #2: He’s awake, on his phone, drinking coffee. I asked how he slept. He said “good.” I personally cannot smell anything suspicious, so I’m cautiously optimistic that he also does not believe his girlfriend urinates from her mouth.

update #3: He just left for work. No suspicion. No comments. No raised eyebrows. I am now stripping the bed and throwing everything into the washer to destroy all remaining evidence of this cursed event.

I will never yawn again.

I’m two weeks in on this medication my main question is, does it take time to adjust and see it working?

And if so, how long I see so many posts about you know in a day and I’m just getting nervous because it’s been a couple weeks and I’m still so unsure and not sure if it’s side effects or what.

I’m on other medicines, but I am new to stimulants. I started at 10 mg for a week and then we moved up to 20 mg for a week.

So here’s what’s going on so far : novel incoming …

The first week wasn’t awful. I thought I felt it working . Mostly the first two days but that could’ve just been anxiety adrenaline and I was having too much coffee with it  I’m still having coffee but much less than trying to do it a couple hours after or before I’m just going back-and-forth with that.

I’m drinking a lot of water with electrolytes although I’m not sure how many electrolytes are too many I’m eating or drinking lots of protein with my medicine so I’m trying to do all the right things .

On 10 mg I THINK i was crashing at like two (I take my medicine around 10:30 11 AM because I want it to last as long as possible into the evening)  just getting really tired and mild headache.

Fast-forward moving up to 20 and I would say it’s super hard to determine if it’s working or not some days I think maybe.. and some days I think not..

all I know is in the evenings. I get pretty bad headaches not every day anymore but still annoying and ouch. And anxiety , and the new thing the last couple days around 6 to 7 I get really bad vertigo like I feel like their room is going to spin and I get hot flashes ( now I’m not new to this. I struggled with vertigo, but it hasn’t been this bad in a long time and it feels like it’s something to do with the medicine or it could be that it definitely is flaring up my anxiety. i’m not sure. I just know it seems worse or I’m hyper focusing on the worse either way, which makes it feel worse.) because with that being said in the evenings, my anxiety is worse as well.

And I get really cry. It’s almost like I didn’t feel like I could always cry before ( not always but a lot because of my other medicines) and now I can.

TMI definitely gave me a libido back, but that sucks when you feel like crap.

This is not even all of it. You know there’s tension and just a lot of different things that I honestly don’t know if it’s the medicine or me and I don’t wanna move up too fast if it takes time to work and I’m just not getting a direct answer from my psych psychiatrist so figured I’d post here again. I’m sorry it’s a novel if you’ve got this far I appreciate you.

Honestly, it could probably be longer welcome to ADHD I guess lol

Just nervous about getting to work and if it does work, it won’t last long and like I know no medicine is a magic pill but the main reason for this was to help my physical symptoms I’ve had before not make them worse and my anxiety and now I’m just unsure.

I know non-stimulants are an option if this doesn’t work, but I don’t know if I could take them with the antidepressant. I’m on. Time will tell.

Last but not least thank you again for all your help personal experiences really helped me and so does this group. I’m really not sure if any of this makes sense so I apologize. I just feel weird.

Edit: gosh I need to shut up, but I will add. I have been crocheting a lot. I’m not good at it. I’ve only ever done one thing but my friend and encourages me to do it and I’ve been doing it and my husband thinks it’s because of the medicine I’ve been doing it even though I feel like I’m doing everything else as far as cleaning and stuff because I just feel so off and not well.

1qi72hx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qi72hx/secret_drinker/,Secret Drinker,"Using a throwaway bc he also uses reddit, also apologies in advance for the length. 

 It is hard to say how long this has been going on, but if I (26F) had to guess, it would be over the course of the last year and a half or two. We have been together for a little over 5 years. The situation: My Fiance (27M) secretly drinks.

The first time I noticed when I would get home and observe he was pretty obviously drunk. Pink cheeks, a stumbly, slow with words, etc. I would ask about it and he would insist that he was completely sober. We don’t keep much liquor around home, maybe a handle of vodka and some triple sec for a cocktail once in a while, so it was pretty obvious when the liquor was draining. As gently as I could, I called him on it. We had a conversation, I couldn’t tell you everything that was said as it was too long ago now, but it finished with him apologizing and saying he knows he has to and will do better.

We have had the same conversation a handful more times since then. The bottles continued to drain, though slower. We had another conversation. I found a bottle in his drawers when I was putting up laundry. We talked again. After the first time, he were no longer getting drunk but he was clearly still draining bottles drinking in secret. It came to a head when we brought home an expensive bottle after a trip wherein we got engaged. The bottle didn't last very long once we got home. I didn't even know till I pulled the empty bottle out of its canister when I was trying to make him an evening beverage after a long week. That incident was a little under a year ago. All had been well since then I thought

I would like to take a moment to include what I consider an important detail to all of this. I have never had any problems with him drinking. I also drink. Not often on the weekdays but sometimes I like to have a nice little cocktail. My main issue with all of this, as I have iterated to him during every conversation is the sneaking, lying, and the occasional attempt at gaslighting around it. I couldn't care less if he wants to have a drink. It is hiding it ad lying about it that is a problem for me.

Anyway, I, a fool, in a gesture of good faith, after a long stint of things going very well, and in wanting to trust the person I am about to marry very soon, and in wanting to give him the opportunity to be trusted, got him a nice bottle as a holiday gift. It was on sale, it was a nod to our past adventures. It was sentimental. 

I had a gut feeling over a week ago, I checked the bottle inside the canister and noticed some missing. Thinking, I might just be a little paranoid, I left it, and continued to check periodically. Sure enough, the quantity of liquid was decreasing. Yesterday there was probably about 2-3 fingers left in the bottle. This morning, the bottle was full. I opened it and took a sip. He filled it with water. he's never done that before.

When I tell you I was so upset i was shaking, I mean I could hardly hold the pen to write the note ""how stupid you must think I am"". I threw out the note, I know that is not the correct approach. My next thought was to put the bottle on the counter and leave a note stating ""our marriage will not succeed if this habit continues"". Because to me, this is a fact. But it feels like an ultimatum or a threat in a way, so I definitely don't think  I should do that.

The reason I was even thinking about leaving a note was because I go straight from home to the gym after work. They get home while I'm gone. I don’t know if I can come home to them acting like everything is normal and hit that with an ""I know what you did"". My next thought is to set the bottle on the counter and leave a note that says ""we need to talk"".

He snapped at me over coffee this morning, completely Unwarranted and far outside of his usual behavior (this happened before I checked the bottle) Looking back I'm wondering now if he must have a hangover. I haven't texted him today. He knows something is up but thinks it's about coffee, I'm sure. 

I feel emotionally drained, and incredibly lost for what to do about this. I want to marry this person, I know that he is so much more than this behavior, but I fear the impact that the continuation of this habit may have on our future. What do I do?

This event is completely free and open to all ages. You do not need to have played before, as we will happily teach you the game! 

Come join us and the growing group of friends and families who join us every second and fourth Friday to play their (and your new) favorite social game! 

What is Blood on the Clocktower? 

Think: Werewolf, Mafia, even Among Us

The game puts a good town against the evil demon and their Minions. The townsfolk do not know who anyone is, and will have to deduce who among them is secretly evil, while the Evil team knows each other, and tries to blend in as townsfolk while destroying the town.

Unlike other games, every player will always have some sort of special ability, allowing you to always have a piece to the puzzle of this ever-evolvig mystery. Also different from other games, every player can still participate, even after the demon kills them, or the town votes them out! You still can talk, abd you still win or lose with your team! Meaning you can help solve the game for your team even from beyond the grave!

Any questions, comments, or concerns? Ask away, check us out online (just Google our name), or DM me!

I had what I thought was a coffee chat with a senior person at a Big 4 firm (PwC), but afterwards the senior person CC’d someone from HR, so it started feeling more like an actual interview / screening conversation.

During the “tell me about yourself” part, I talked about my general interests and I said something along the lines of:

I like following the news and geopolitics, and seeing the things that Trump is doing.

Now I’m stressing because I’m wondering if that was a mistake.

This is for a consulting-related area (government/defence type work), so I’m worried that mentioning Trump could come off as:

	•	too political / controversial

	•	a risk for professionalism

	•	showing poor judgment / lack of awareness

	•	“we can’t trust this person, too high risk”

I’m not even trying to debate politics or push anything, I just said it in the moment as an example of current events I follow, but now I’m thinking it could’ve been a red flag.

1qi6yw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1qi6yw1/roommate_doesnt_want_me_to_furnish_the_apartment/,Roommate doesn’t want me to furnish the apartment,"So to be clear… I (26F) actually like my roommate (also 26F) a lot. She was the first person I ever messaged on roommates dot com. Three years go by and we’re best friends. We get along so well and are such good roommates that we actually moved across town to a new place together 6 months ago. For the most part it’s been great and we’re both happy.

Last year I got a new job and have been making a lot more money and also work from home half the time. When we moved in together, we were in our early 20s and both super broke. All the furniture in her place (I moved in with her to the old place replacing a much shittier roommate on the lease) was bought off of the weird 40yo guy who lived there before for like 15 yrs for $200 altogether, most of it was irreversibly stained and dirty and partially broken. We have talked extensively over the years about how it would have to be replaced at some point. Since moving in I have helped her sell her stained broken furniture on FBM and given her the money back — I take care of selling it bc I have more time and I’m at the apartment more. I’ve bought a couple pieces of furniture with my own money — all of which I have texted her pictures of first to see if she likes it. We have an agreement that if she doesn’t like something it will go in my room and not in the common area. Because  she makes less money than me I have told her that it would only be fair to essentially consider this new furniture hers. It improves my quality of life to have nice furniture in my place, but because it’s a replacement for her old furniture, if one of us moves out, I’d let her keep anything that was a replacement. She agreed to this because that was her hesitation with replacing the old furniture.

Honestly, interior decorating is a bit of a hobby for me. Even when I was still really broke I still liked home diys a lot. It’s really fun for me to be scouting all the time on Facebook marketplace, going to thrift stores, garage sales, and estate sales to find good deals on stuff. I have mild autism & severe ADHD so sometimes I go throughl phases where I get really hyper fixated on it for a few months. Meanwhile my roommate doesn’t like it at all. She has told me point blank that even if she had money and spare time that finding furniture and decorating the place stresses her out and is not fun for her. **Despite this I have ALWAYS been clear that she is free to help me decorate and add things to the space. I have even told her that if she wants something in particular that I would buy it.**

Last night I bought a really cute closet off of Facebook Marketplace. We needed one badly because this place has less storage than our old one and there was a lot of unsightly clutter with nowhere to go — not just like a couple items, I mean like it looked like a hoarder house with big piles of extension cords and random junk/drawer kind of stuff sitting around in piles. We actually still hadn’t been able to unpack several boxes of stuff from when we moved 6 mos ago. The broom, vacuum, and mop had to be out in the open. So — with her permission, showing her a picture — I went and got a closet and was able to put all that stuff away. Then, because it was Memorial day and I had free time, I also installed a bunch of framed artwork that I have been collecting for about 6 months at estate sales — EVERY SINGLE THING I PUT UP I HAD ALREADY SHOWN HER. And to every single one she said “I like it! You can hang that up.” There were a couple she didn’t like that went in my room. I hadn’t had any time to hang them up until yesterday. My other friend from out of town was coming to visit so I also did a general deep clean of the apartment just to get it super tidy and appropriate for a guest.

My guest came and went.

Then, my roommate came home from work and immediately began acting really weird, angry, and passive aggressive, giving me the silent treatment. She comes back from walking the dog and begins angrily cleaning the already spotless apartment. Then she abruptly starts freaking out, saying that there’s too much change in the apartment and I’m decorating too much. I reminded her that I had explicitly asked and gotten her permission for every single thing I had changed. She said I was rushing the process and that everything in the apartment had only my personality and she wanted to decorate too… but she also started going on about how I have more money and free time than her so she can’t decorate and that decorating stresses her out. I said that I know that and I’m sorry but I felt like by asking her permission before getting anything new I was at the very least not just blindly imposing my taste without her permission

Then she said that we have to stop decorating the apartment completely. She said that it wasn’t fair and I should wait for her to be in a better financial position “…which will be in about 3 years.” 3 years. My roommate is a freelancer in a precarious industry and she only just switched to freelancing, she’s managing fine but as we all know the economy is not good right now. She has almost no savings. Additionally, as I said, she actually actively hates decorating and buying new furniture.

**I also want to be clear that since we moved in, the place has been super chaotic. We have no coffee table (the old one was rotting), until I put up the artwork the walls were blank, we have no lamps or lighting, and the kitchen has limited storage so it constantly looks messy and nothing can be fully put away (I wanted to buy a cupboard/pantry bc there is a good spot for one). Honestly, until I got the closet, this place was so messy and unfinished (like literally we couldn’t fully unpack) that it was unfit to have guests.** This isn’t a situation where there was an already established common living area, we basically live in a newly moved into apartment and I have spent 6 months saving my own money and spent many hours of time making plans to make it nicer — checking in with her each time I make a change. Now she basically just thinks I shouldn’t be allowed to decorate it because it’s not fair that I have the money, time, and interest/enjoyment of decorating to do so and she doesn’t. **I completely understand that money differences can make friendships more uncomfortable. But this is also just a part of adult life. Life is not fair. I have never ever pressured her to spend money she doesn’t have, ever, and I never would.** I’m also not super wealthy or anything!! I basically just got a promotion that allows me to have a tiny bit of disposable income for the first time in my adult life. I don’t go out to drink or party, I don’t spend lavishly at all, I’m actually very frugal. I saved up for 6 months just to begin getting furniture for our half-unpacked new apartment

**I have already decided that I am going to take a pause on decorating or getting anything new for the common space. That’s not what this question is about.**

I just basically think that it is unreasonable to ban one roommate from decorating the space, especially when they’ve been collaborating and asking for your permission the whole time. I understand that if it’s a situation where you’ve lived in a place for years and you suddenly begin switching the common area for no reason, that is inconsiderate, but this is a brand new half-unpacked, cluttered apartment. **For the most part, I was never imposing my taste or putting up frivolous decorations. I basically saved up my own money just so we could get a baseline of clean, functional, and inviting enough to have guests over. In fact I would say it was less “decorating” than it was “basic furnishing.”**

However, she got so upset and made me feel really really bad for doing this last night so I would like feedback — **do u think it is okay to ban your roommate from decorating/furnishing the apartment? Was I really overstepping and being inconsiderate?? Open to feedback, I feel super bad about this. AITAH? Do you have any advice on what I should do??**",3,1768929154.0,badroommates,10,1.0,False

Hi (1st post here, new to the subreddit etc)

I like espresso. And I would like to be able to drink a good one at home. 

At the moment we have a nespresso at home which my wife uses for coffee at breakfast. I don’t use it for espresso because I don’t really like what I’m getting from it.

I was thinking on getting into espresso. I’m ok with spending 500€ at first. (And then eventually gradually some more but at as first step around 500).

From what I read the sage/breville barista express should be a good choice for me.

Is it a good first choice? The amount of knowledge/work to the espresso I’ll get out of it?

Is it good enough to enjoy while being easy enough to use for half-awake breakfast?

Are there better options on this price range?

What could I do if someone wanted a larger cup of coffee? Take 2 double ones?

Starbucks or the one in the town we live near. Problem is, that's 3 miles in the wrong direction in the morning when trying to get 4 kids ready to take to school so it's rare I have time to run and get one.

So for Christmas I bought my wife a Breville Bambino Plus, Breville smart grinder, one of the fancy whipped cream dispensers with a box of nitrogen cans, and all the mixings that the local coffee shop uses.

First time setting it up, it would barely dispense anything. Hit the double shot button 3 times to get enough out. Found out I was too fine, and that the magic numbers are 18g and 36g for the grind then the double shot.

So each day I would adjust the grind size and time on the grinder until I got 18g of grounds and then weighed the espresso. Today was the first day it hit 18g AND 36g. 

I also learned how to make the crispy caramel bits that Starbucks uses on their fancy holiday only lattes (I already forgot what they're called).

Im into specialty coffee for years now, and doing pour overs for years now, but since Im moved to Copenhagen (and buying local beans here)-

Well, my brews mostly s\*ck. 

Practically-

Ive bought 3 different La Cabra’s now- and tbh, they come out terrible:

I use the 1zpresso q2 pentagonal grinder, ZeroWater filtering with apax “tonic” drops (30-50 ppm), with different brewers: kalita wave, v60, hario switch.

I ofc focus on one brewer at a time- but frankly the “best” results on all of these had maybe some nice sweetness, absolutely zero floral or any distinct notes. Coarser, finer, multiple pours, slow, fast- I did absolutely all tests: and I can at the very best get some ok sweetness, not anything more. 

I usually need a super fine grind (40 -50 clicks) for it not to be disgusting. 

Its usually the same results for April Prolog and Coffee collective (which I never liked anyways). Yet when I get some Dak, Manhattan, Kawa (now Tannat)- they’re usually much more interesting although still hard to tune. 

In general brazilien’s and a bit more medium roasts work better for me, but then again its hard to get floral notes.

As a side note- the espressos also in the shops here are very bad in my opinion, they all do now a 19 sec pull with 1:10000 ratio- zero body, zero taste. Amsterdam, Berlin, even Lisbon- we’re completely different experience.

Also pour overs in cafes here are like 50% chance of a nice cup, 50% black water. La Cabra nailed it one time for me, otherwise meh. 

I wonder:

Is it my grinder that’s the limiting factor? Or other equipment/technique thing that’s in my control? 

Or is it the coffees themselves? That are just jot flavourful for me..

In a side note I also wonder if this ‘nordic’ hype is a trend with zero justification nowadays. 

Its very frustrating to live in what was once the specialty scene frontier, and still have to bet which cafe would be have the least-flavourless espresso today:( ",2,1768928695.0,pourover,23,0.62,False
1qi6qs5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1qi6qs5/dark_psychology_tricks_that_actually_work/,Dark Psychology Tricks That ACTUALLY Work (Science-Based Guide to Understanding Human Influence),"look, i spent months deep diving into this rabbit hole. books on influence, persuasion psychology, behavioral economics, even some uncomfortably honest memoirs from former cult members and con artists. not because i wanted to manipulate people, but because i was tired of feeling like everyone else knew some secret playbook i didn't.

turns out, understanding these tactics isn't about becoming some master manipulator. it's about recognizing when they're being used on you. and yeah, sometimes using them ethically to navigate social situations better. the internet loves to demonize this stuff, but honestly? most ""dark psychology"" is just human nature weaponized. we're all wired with cognitive biases and emotional triggers. that's not our fault. it's biology, evolutionary programming, societal conditioning all mixed together.

here's what actually works in real situations, backed by research and observation.

**the foot in the door technique works stupidly well**

cialdini's [*Influe*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28815.Influence)[*nce*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28815.Influence) covers this extensively. you ask for something small first, get compliance, then escalate to what you actually wanted. i watched a fundraiser use this at my local mall. started with ""would you support clean water initiatives?"" (who says no to that), then moved to ""great, can you sign this petition?"" then finally ""since you care about this cause, would you consider a small donation?""

the commitment and consistency bias makes people want to align their actions with previous statements. once someone agrees they care about something, backing out feels cognitively uncomfortable.

saw this play out when my roommate's girlfriend wanted to move in. didn't start with that. started with ""can i leave some clothes here?"" then ""makes sense to have a drawer right?"" six months later, full move in. he never saw it coming.

**strategic silence is a superpower**

most people can't handle conversational gaps. they'll fill silence with information you never asked for. lawyers, interrogators, therapists, they all know this. after asking a question, just wait. don't rescue them from the awkwardness.

i tested this during salary negotiations at my last job. stated my number, then literally bit my tongue. the hiring manager stumbled through three different justifications and eventually came up way higher than i expected. the discomfort of silence makes people want to give you something just to end it.

**mirroring builds instant rapport**

neuroscience research shows that subtle mimicry activates mirror neurons and creates unconscious connection. match someone's body language, speaking pace, energy level. not obviously, but enough that their brain registers similarity.

chris voss talks about this in [*Never Split the Difference*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26156469-never-split-the-difference). he's a former FBI hostage negotiator, so yeah, stakes were slightly higher than your average coffee chat. he'd mirror everything from speech patterns to breathing rhythms with hostage takers.

works in job interviews, dates, difficult conversations with family. people trust those who seem like them. it's tribal psychology that hasn't evolved out of us yet.

**scarcity and urgency override logic**

every marketing team knows this. ""limited time offer"" ""only 3 spots left"" ""deal expires tonight"". creates fomo that short circuits rational decision making.

watched my friend drop $400 on a course because ""enrollment closes in 2 hours."" i checked later. enrollment ""closes"" every week, then reopens. but his brain didn't care about that possibility in the moment. the perceived scarcity triggered loss aversion, which psychologically hurts more than potential gains feel good.

**reciprocity is hardwired into us**

give something first, people feel obligated to give back. doesn't have to be big. a genuine compliment, small favor, piece of useful information.

real example: coworker always brought extra coffee for people on her team. when she needed coverage for her vacation days, everyone volunteered immediately. wasn't calculated manipulation, but the reciprocity principle absolutely played a role.

**emotional contagion spreads faster than logic**

people catch emotions like viruses. enter a room with confident energy, others absorb it. come in anxious and scattered, that spreads too.

decade of research by sigal barsade at wharton showed how emotional contagion affects everything from team performance to negotiation outcomes. she found that positive emotions improve cooperation and decision quality, while negative emotions tank both.

if you want to shift a conversation's direction, shift your emotional state first. the group will follow.

**the benjamin franklin effect is delightfully backwards**

asking someone for a favor makes them like you more, not less. sounds wrong but it's real. when people do you a favor, their brain justifies it by deciding you must be worth helping.

franklin himself used this. had a rival in the pennsylvania legislature. asked to borrow a rare book from the guy's library. the rival sent it, franklin returned it with a thank you note, and they became lifelong friends.

your brain doesn't like cognitive dissonance. ""i did something nice for this person, therefore i must like them"" resolves that tension.

**selective vulnerability creates connection**

sharing something personal (not trauma dumping, just authentic) makes others feel closer to you and more likely to reciprocate. brené brown's entire career is built on vulnerability research.

difference between manipulation and connection here is intent. manipulative vulnerability is calculated to extract something. authentic vulnerability is just being human and letting others in.

i've noticed people share way more with me after i mention something real i'm dealing with. nothing crazy, just honest about a struggle or failure. suddenly the conversation goes ten layers deeper.

**the contrast principle skews perception**

show something expensive first, the next option seems reasonable by comparison. retail does this constantly. why do you think there's always some $800 jacket next to the $200 one they actually want to sell you?

works in reverse too. if you want someone to agree to something, present a worse option first. suddenly your actual request seems totally fair.

**subtle assumption language bypasses resistance**

instead of ""would you be interested in meeting up?"" try ""when works better for you, thursday or saturday?"" presupposes they're meeting you, just negotiating logistics.

sales people live in this space. ""how many would you like?"" not ""would you like to buy this?"" the question assumes the sale already happened.

look, most of this isn't some evil mind control. it's understanding how humans work and using that knowledge. every good communicator, leader, negotiator, and yeah, manipulator, uses these principles.

the ethics come down to intent. using these to genuinely connect, navigate tricky situations, or protect yourself from being manipulated? probably fine. using them to exploit, deceive, or harm people? obviously not.

if you want to go deeper without spending months reading psychology research and influence books, there's an AI learning app called [*BeFreed*](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450?utm_source=chatgpt.com) that pulls from sources like Cialdini's work, behavioral economics research, and expert interviews on persuasion psychology.

You can set a specific goal like ""recognize manipulation tactics in daily life"" or ""improve social influence ethically"" and it generates a structured learning plan with personalized audio lessons. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly good, including this sarcastic style that makes dense psychology concepts way more digestible. makes it easier to internalize these patterns without the research fatigue.

we can't unlearn human psychology. we can choose what to do with the knowledge. recognize these patterns in advertising, relationships, negotiations, social situations. protect yourself from bad actors. and maybe use them occasionally when the situation calls for it and your conscience is clear.

the real dark psychology trick? pretending this stuff doesn't affect you. we're all susceptible. at least now you know what to watch for.",2,1768928678.0,MenWithDiscipline,0,1.0,False

1qi6o9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommates/comments/1qi6o9a/roommate_doesnt_want_me_to_furnish_our_apartment/,Roommate doesn’t want me to furnish our apartment,"So to be clear… I (26F) won the roommate  lottery. She (26F) was the first person I ever messaged on roommates dot com. Three years go by and we’re best friends. We get along so well and are such good roommates that we actually moved across town to a new place together 6 months ago. For the most part it’s been great and we’re both happy.

Last year I got a new job and have been making a lot more money and also work from home half the time. When we moved in together, we were in our early 20s and both super broke. All the furniture in her place (I moved in with her to the old place replacing a much shittier roommate on the lease) was bought off of the weird 40yo guy who lived there before for like 15 yrs for $200 altogether, most of it was irreversibly stained and dirty and partially broken. We have talked extensively over the years about how it would have to be replaced at some point. Since moving in I have helped her sell her stained broken furniture on FBM and given her the money back — I take care of selling it bc I have more time and I’m at the apartment more. I’ve bought a couple pieces of furniture with my own money — all of which I have texted her pictures of first to see if she likes it. We have an agreement that if she doesn’t like something it will go in my room and not in the common area. Because  she makes less money than me I have told her that it would only be fair to essentially consider this new furniture hers. It improves my quality of life to have nice furniture in my place, but because it’s a replacement for her old furniture, if one of us moves out, I’d let her keep anything that was a replacement. She agreed to this because that was her hesitation with replacing the old furniture.

Honestly, interior decorating is a bit of a hobby for me. Even when I was still really broke I still liked home diys a lot. It’s really fun for me to be scouting all the time on Facebook marketplace, going to thrift stores, garage sales, and estate sales to find good deals on stuff. I have mild autism & severe ADHD so sometimes I go throughl phases where I get really hyper fixated on it for a few months. Meanwhile my roommate doesn’t like it at all. She has told me point blank that even if she had money and spare time that finding furniture and decorating the place stresses her out and is not fun for her. Despite this I have ALWAYS been clear that she is free to help me decorate and add things to the space. I have even told her that if she wants something in particular that I would buy it.

Last night I bought a really cute closet off of Facebook Marketplace. We needed one badly because this place has less storage than our old one and there was a lot of unsightly clutter with nowhere to go — not just like a couple items, I mean like it looked like a hoarder house with big piles of extension cords and random junk/drawer kind of stuff sitting around in piles. We actually still hadn’t been able to unpack several boxes of stuff from when we moved 6 mos ago. The broom, vacuum, and mop had to be out in the open. So — with her permission, showing her a picture — I went and got a closet and was able to put all that stuff away. Then, because it was Memorial day and I had free time, I also installed a bunch of framed artwork that I have been collecting for about 6 months at estate sales — EVERY SINGLE THING I PUT UP I HAD ALREADY SHOWN HER. And to every single one she said “I like it! You can hang that up.” There were a couple she didn’t like that went in my room. I hadn’t had any time to hang them up until yesterday. My other friend from out of town was coming to visit so I also did a general deep clean of the apartment just to get it super tidy and appropriate for a guest.

My guest came and went.

Then, my roommate came home from work and immediately began acting really weird, angry, and passive aggressive, giving me the silent treatment. She comes back from walking the dog and begins angrily cleaning the already spotless apartment. Then she abruptly starts freaking out, saying that there’s too much change in the apartment and I’m decorating too much. I reminded her that I had explicitly asked and gotten her permission for every single thing I had changed. She said I was rushing the process and that everything in the apartment had only my personality and she wanted to decorate too… but she also started going on about how I have more money and free time than her so she can’t decorate and that decorating stresses her out. I said that I know that and I’m sorry but I felt like by asking her permission before getting anything new I was at the very least not just blindly imposing my taste without her permission

Then she said that we have to stop decorating the apartment completely. She said that it wasn’t fair and I should wait for her to be in a better financial position “…which will be in about 3 years.” 3 years. My roommate is a freelancer in a precarious industry and she only just switched to freelancing, she’s managing fine but as we all know the economy is not good right now. She has almost no savings. Additionally, as I said, she actually actively hates decorating and buying new furniture.

**I also want to be clear that since we moved in, the place has been super chaotic. We have no coffee table (the old one was rotting), until I put up the artwork the walls were blank, we have no lamps or lighting, and the kitchen has limited storage so it constantly looks messy and nothing can be fully put away (I wanted to buy a cupboard/pantry bc there is a good spot for one). Honestly, until I got the closet, this place was so messy and unfinished (like literally we couldn’t fully unpack) that it was unfit to have guests.** This isn’t a situation where there was an already established common living area, we basically live in a newly moved into apartment and I have spent 6 months saving my own money and spent many hours of time making plans to make it nicer — checking in with her each time I make a change. Now she basically just thinks I shouldn’t be allowed to decorate it because it’s not fair that I have the money, time, and interest/enjoyment of decorating to do so and she doesn’t. **I completely understand that money differences can make friendships more uncomfortable. But this is also just a part of adult life. Life is not fair.** I have never ever pressured her to spend money she doesn’t have, ever, and I never would. I’m also not super wealthy or anything!! I basically just got a promotion that allows me to have a tiny bit of disposable income for the first time in my adult life. I don’t go out to drink or party, I don’t spend lavishly at all, I’m actually very frugal. I saved up for 6 months just to begin getting furniture for our half-unpacked new apartment

**I have already decided that I am going to take a pause on decorating or getting anything new for the common space. That’s not what this question is about.**

I just basically think that it isn’t fair to ban one roommate from decorating the space, especially when they’ve been collaborating and asking for your permission the whole time. I understand that if it’s a situation where you’ve lived in a place for years and you suddenly begin switching the common area for no reason, that is inconsiderate, but this is a brand new half-unpacked, cluttered apartment. **For the most part, I was never imposing my taste or putting up frivolous decorations. I basically saved up my own money just so we could get a baseline of clean, functional, and inviting enough to have guests over. In fact I would say it was less “decorating” than it was “basic furnishing.”**

However, she got so upset and made me feel really really bad for doing this last night so I would like feedback — \*l**do u think it is okay to ban your roommate from decorating/furnishing the apartment? Was I really overstepping and being inconsiderate?? Open to feedback, I feel super bad about this. AITAH? Do you have any advice on what I should do??**",1,1768928529.0,roommates,1,1.0,False

It’s a recruitment/hiring agency, although I’m not part of the recruitment team myself. I’m at front desk/reception.

Management recently complained about a dip in employee morale and have implemented a new team building exercise. Yay for us! (Employees only, of course, as management is conveniently omitted from said team building exercise). The activity they’ve selected is a 3-5km walk/run to a coffee shop where we will all enjoy a cup of coffee, and then walk/run back to work to begin the work part of our work day. Not a daily exercise, but every second day or so. All good and well, but here’s the thing I’m uncomfortable with. We’re required to do this outside of work hours, in the morning, between 07:00 and 08:00 (our official start time is 8AM). We won’t be compensated for this team building exercise time.

I’m also ignoring the fact that we’re sweating balls here from sun-up to sundown due to it being summer in South Africa. Many of us tend to sweat even on a 5km walk. Our route offers no shade. Just hot asphalt/pavement through noisy rush hour traffic—perfect for team building amiright? Also, our office has only one shower, but no water heater, so if any of us feel a bit icky after the exercise we’ll have to take a refreshing cold shower. This is also the only bathroom on the business premises, which is shared by about 8-10 of us at any given time (the toilet is in the bathroom with the shower so anyone showering will be holding up the toilet-goers, and vice versa).

So I did what my therapist has been begging me to do for years but I’m always too scared to do: I set a boundary. I told my manager that this team building exercise takes place outside of work hours, with no remuneration for our time, and I will not be participating.

My manager was upset with me. She agreed that it wasn’t an official duty and that I would not be compensated but made it clear it was one of those things you should be happy to do because you’re “part of the team” and “everyone is happy to do it”. “Going the extra mile” (as they say in recruitment). I already go the extra mile during office hours. My last performance review (a week ago) was stellar.

TLDR: Management wants us to do a morning coffee shop walk/run team building exercise every few days outside of work/office hours. I set what I believe was a reasonable (and healthy) boundary and declined to participate. AITAH?

1qi6iyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Phobia/comments/1qi6iyw/i_have_not_left_my_town_in_29_years_due_to/,I have not left my town in 29 years due to claustrophobia. What can help me?,"I saw a You Tube travel video of a man walking down the aisle of an airplane flying to Germany on vacation. Just the visuals of that plane's interior and the tiny spaces between the seats confined in that steel tube of an airplane made me feel like I was being buried alive in a coffin. I had to fast forward the video until he landed in Germany. I'm writing this in the hope others feel this way and I'm not alone. 

I cannot take a train (confined in my chair, can't leave if I want to), cannot take a long bus ride to a different city (confined in my chair, can't leave if I want to). I even avoid driving my car the closest way to town because there is always a damn wreck that shuts down traffic (when I'm trapped in traffic it makes me want to throw the door open and run screaming down the street).  Thank God there are no tall buildings with elevators I have to deal with in my dinky 2-story little town. And get arrested? Handcuffed in the back of a tiny cop car and locked in jail? My heart would explode and I would die, or else I would want to die.

The result of this is I have not left more than 100 miles from my house for the last 29 years. That means nothing new in my life to see or experience. That means no escape from the cold in Winter, or trips to Italy or Hawaii (and I can afford them). One day I will be elderly stuck in bed, and I will have no fun memories of anything but this shit town I live in. Please give me advice and change my life, I will be so grateful.

Here's the funny part. When I was a teenager, I LOVED to fly. The rush of that plane taking off and throwing me back in my seat as it went through the clouds into the sun was like sex. It was so great. One time I flew for hours in a tiny private plane crammed shoulder to shoulder with 5 people, drinking coffee the entire flight and loved it! WTF? I cannot believe what has happened to my mind over the years to turn me into this mess of a human? I even insist on being cremated and having my ashes thrown to the wind because the thought I may retain consciousness buried underground is unbearable.

For one thing, I ballooned up to 300 pounds as I got into my 30s, can't fit even in a 1st class seat. Also, prolonged exposure to stress from working and paying bills has warped my mind and ""fight or flight"" response. And one time I was stuck on an airplane on the runway for two hours due to plane in front of us having mechanical problems, man if that happened to me today I would be arrested for running out the emergency door to get away. I've seen therapists who tried but cannot help. Please tell me I'm not alone. AND HOW THE HELL DO YOU BEAT THIS? Yes, I have lorazepam, but there are not enough drugs in the world to calm me down. Even Novocain does not work on me when I go to the dentist. 

If you can give me something to get me back to the happy way I was, so I can escape this cold and fly to Vegas to see the Sphere, oh man I will be so grateful.

Then I got to comparing how I feel while viewing porn and the differences seem staggering. Simply put, it’s not a good feeling despite what our brains may be telling us. We may not even be noticing exactly how we truly feel being we are completely distracted and feeding into the dopamine chase.

I’ll start with some.  Feelings of jealousy, inadequacy, enhanced aggression or anger, demoralization, brain fog, shame and possibly guilt.

We've been in each other's lives for almost a decade, the kind of closeness where you know each other's coffee order and you can read a mood from a single ""k"". For years I thought that meant we were solid. But somewhere along the way I became her emotional emergency room. If she had a bad day, I was on call. If she was anxious, I was expected to drop whatever I was doing and talk her down. I work in healthcare and I already carry a lot of other people's stress, so the idea of ""being needed"" used to feel flattering. Then it started feeling like I could never clock out. She'd text me paragraphs, then follow up if I didn't answer fast enough. If I said I was tired, she'd say stuff like ""ok sorry I bother you"" or ""I guess I'm too much"" and I'd end up soothing her about… soothing her. I tried setting small boundaries, like not doing heavy talks at 1am or asking her to not send ten messages in a row when I'm at work. She'd take it as rejection and get cold for days. The weirdest part is I started feeling my body react when her name popped up: tight chest, clenched jaw, that tiny dread-nausea. I'm 32 and I felt like a teenager hiding my phone from a parent. That can't be normal for a friendship.

The final straw wasn't one huge fight, it was me realizing I was resentful almost all the time. I caught myself being snappy with people who didn't deserve it because I was already drained, and that scared me. So I wrote her a long message (took me like 2 hours and I still typo'd alot). I said I care about her and I'm grateful for what we used to be, but I feel used now and I'm not capable of being someone's constant lifeline. I told her I need distance, and I can't keep doing the daily check-ins and crisis mode. She replied with a mix of ""I guess you never really loved me"" and ""wow, I thought you were different"" and then a final ""fine, do what you want."" I didn't argue. I just said I'm sorry this hurts, but this is where I'm at. Since then I've felt this huge calm, like my brain finally has quiet. And that calm is what makes me feel gross. Because shouldn't I be devastated? I miss parts of her. I miss the inside jokes and the rare nights where we laughed until we cried. I also feel this empty space where the constant contact used to be, and I keep reaching for my phone out of habit. Mostly I feel guilty, because I know she's going to tell herself a story where I'm the villain. Maybe I am. I dont know. I just know I can't keep drowning quietly so she can stay afloat.

Pat noticed her long before she noticed him. She was outside, hiding next to the window. Her name was Farah, and she was quirky, shy and, according to the boys his age, hideous.

Patrick, known to everyone as Pat, didn’t actually think so, he never formed an opinion and or a side for Farah, but everyone else in his class had seemed to belong to making fun of her to not caring at all about her existence.

And all this was because of an upper cleft lip, perfect attendance, grades and being the favorite of all the teachers. She spoke in a quiet, breathy way because she felt self-conscious about her lip. When she spoke at all, it was hard to get anything out of her, not without reason. The first time she spoke in class, everyone laughed.

Pat waited for the teacher to leave and went over to the window and opened it. She didn’t come in at first, just waited outside until the teacher came in and left again.

Days later, Pat walked next to Farah on the way home and called out to her.

“Hey,”

Farah looked his way once, and her eyes went wide. Her gait picked up, and it became almost a slow jog.

“Wait, I want to ask something,” said Pat. He jogged until he came next to her.

She went inside her backpack, took out a book and covered her mouth.

“Hello?”

“Oh, hello. My name’s Patrick, Pat for short,” and extended his hand for a handshake.

“Farah, nice to meet you, Pat.”

“First time you came late, the other day I mean,” said Pat.

“I’m sorry,” said Farah. “Won’t happen again.”

“Is that a joke?”

“No?”

“I’m not a teacher, Farah, I sit next to you in class.”

“It was a joke.”

“Are you being bullied or something?”

Farah stopped and took the book down from her face. They were now facing each other.

“Are you applying for the position, Pat?” asked Farah.

“What? No?”

Pat looked away. He felt offended that she would think he had come over to bully her.

“That was a joke, Pat.”

Farah was one of those girls who had a genuine full-face smile, the kind that came from the mouth, eyes and cheeks. Pat knew he was going red but still found her smile so appealing.

“No one bullies me; I run away after pretending to be simple-minded.”

“Why did you avoid coming in right after I got the window open?”

They walked side by side. She placed the book in the bag and smirked.

“I didn’t want them to think we were friends; they will make fun of you, Pat.”

“So you were being considerate?”

“That extends to me too; they will make fun of me along with you.”

“Makes sense, you can talk normal,”

“Rude!” Farah pouted.

“Why do you talk weirdly in class? You could have had friends talking like this. “

“It happens when I get nervous. It was the first day, and I was nervous.” Farah pointed at her cleft lip. “This doesn’t help.”

“I don’t think it looks that bad; you have a cute smile too.”

Pat only found his brain processing what he had said after he had said it. Farah was already running away, and Pat just stood still and wondered if he actually liked Farah.

***\~Re***

Pat kept talking to her from that point onward. At first, she just stared at him dumbfounded when he tried to strike up a conversation about the book she was reading during lunch, something according to him he had already read and found pretentious.

The boys in his class made fun of him that first week, and then even the girls started talking to him more to ask him to leave her alone. This was such a weird ask of him, though. The girls wanted to keep her away from everyone, and the boys wanted to make fun of her down to her fingertips.

They started walking home together, and as the days went along, Pat and Farah found out that they had the same taste in everything. Pat even sought her out whenever the boys were busy doing something he didn’t want to be associated with, something that could get them all in trouble.

On a day they were hanging out on her porch, a party was ongoing at the backyard, Farah’s 16th birthday, and he was the only person from school.

“Why do the girls hate you?” Asked Pat.

“They don’t hate me; it’s a weird thing, Patty, they don’t like me either.”

“So, why?”

“Because I am meek and disfigured and ugly, at the start of the year they wanted me to follow them around and be a slave. I politely declined.”

“They wanted a pack mule?”

“Exactly, can I ask you something, Patty? Pat? Pat?”

“Go ahead; if it’s about the present, I got a smaller allowance this month.”

“Do you want to ask me to be your girlfriend, Patty?” and Farah did that smile that he loved now.

“Are you applying for the position?” Asked Pat.

“I don’t think I am pretty enough for the job, but a good work ethic can supplement that.”

“Yes, you are.”

“Hello, boyfriend,” all smiles.

“Hello, girlfriend.”

***\~Mi***

Pat was sitting in a chair. It was cloudy out, and family was all around him. The casket was being lowered slowly, his heart breaking with every inch that it went down.

Back home, it took him almost a month to pack away all of Farah’s possessions and let the kids take whichever they wanted from the collection.

The days were slower now that he was alone, and at sixty-three having to do everything alone, and being alone was wearing him down slowly.

Being married to Farah wasn’t always sunshine and roses. They broke up twice while teenagers, went out of touch till early twenties, met up, restarted the relationship and got married as soon as possible. His best years were spent with her, having kids and always trying to make each other smile. It was so great that Pat now felt like he had felt everything the world offered him and just wanted to be with her in the next life, and sometimes asked that he not wake up the next morning.

A year later, Pat came from the lake after a week of fishing to find someone had broken into his house in the absence. After calling the police, he went about the house, checking room after room until he found an overturned box of Farah’s things.

He went through the box and felt his stomach roll over. He had given Farah a ribbon-style hair clip with a rose in the middle hosting a red ruby. It was something he had worked hard to save the money for and had given it to her on their tenth anniversary.

He came out of the house to tell the officers about the missing hair clip, to overhear them saying that the only car that had run the road from Pat’s house had plates from the next county over. Pat was familiar because that was his home as a child, and both he and Farah had moved here because they wanted to buy this house, their dream house.

The next day, he finished packing up for the five-hour journey to his hometown. Got in his car and drove off down the road, Pat didn’t know why he wanted to do this on his own, the only reason he could think of why he would do this, was that he felt lonely and this was something to do.

***\~Fa***

He was inside the pawnshop describing the ruby-encrusted ribbon, but the old man on the other end kept saying that he got no items that matched that description. Pat wandered around the town, eating at diners, spending time at the park, and there were millions of reminders of the steps he had taken with Farah.

Pat thought this would have a depressing effect on him, but the opposite happened because, with every incident that he could think of with Farah ended up making him keel over laughing.

She pretended to be a boy once after they got together, wanting to sneak into a place that only allowed young men, to watch a secret brawling match in the basement of the local pub. She found Pat already inside screaming his heart out, sneaked up and kissed him on the cheek and ran away. Pat was so angry he ran through the crowd, shoving people and getting slapped and beat and got tackled right out the door and got kissed hard on the lips. After she said in a girlish deep voice. “YOU enjoy KISSING BOYS TOO.” and he ended up keeling over with laughter because of how angry he had been.

Farah tried her hand at painting too, and insisted on doing a portrait of Pat as her first one. Every painting she made came out awful in hilarious ways, and she insisted it was the pencils and brushes’ fault that was jeopardizing her artistry. Pat ended up buying her an expensive set of pencils, brushes and paint. The landscapes she painted came out well, and she kept one hanging at her childhood home. She made so many portraits of Pat that one day she came in and pasted them all over the mirrors at his home. He remembered waking up that day, going to the toilet, brushing his teeth and washing his face and ending up staring at his wonky portrait self and getting increasingly alarmed and scared till everything clicked inside his head.

***\~Sol***

Every day spent recollecting memories of Farah was a day that eased the tiredness of his heart that came after her loss. He was purchasing gas when he saw the ribbon on the head of a young pregnant woman walking out after paying. Pat just stared at it adorning her hair so well as she went past him and decided against asking her to give it back.

Instead, he purchased the gas and followed her at a safe distance, trying to find out which house she would go into, and confront the woman there. And to his shock, she went into the driveway of Farah’s childhood home,  Pat came out of the car and stood outside wondering.

A few days later, while parked on the side of the street and watching the house, a person tapped on the passenger side window of his car. Pat almost went in his pants after being startled and found out it was the pregnant lady that was wearing his late wife’s ribbon.

“What do you want, old man?”

“You live in my late wife’s house,” answered Pat.

“So? My late husband bought it, not yours anymore, scram.”

“Can I come in to talk?”

“Talk about what? I have nothing to talk with no stranger.”

“Please, can I give you my identification?”

“All right, hand it over.”

Pat got his wallet out, and she took a picture of it and then sent it to someone.

“My ma's got your picture now. Come in.”

The dilapidated and ruined house had peeling wallpaper, holes in the floor, and a pervasive smell of rotting wood. But it still gave Pat a thrilled feeling of being at her home again and almost felt like her teenage self might come down the stairs smiling and happy.

She waved him into the kitchen and gave him an old beat-up chair, and went about making tea or coffee.

“What happened to your husband?”

“If he robbed you, make your problems at his grave and leave me alone, old man.”

“He might have, but I don’t need what he stole anymore.”

“Okay.”

“So what happened to him?”

“Got shot and robbed while trying to sell things he stole.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Don’t mind that; he was no good. I got this.” She pointed at her tummy. “An had to stick around with that no-good loser.”

“I actually came here to get something back, but since then months have passed.”

“What was it?”

“A rose ribbon with a ruby, a hair clip, I mean.”

“You want it?”

“No, it looks perfect on you.”

“Not interested, old man. Go find a woman your own age.”

“I was not.”

“Joke, calm down.” She laughed. “Dana Dosey.”

“Patrick Coal, nice to meet you, Dana.”

***\~La***

Spending time with Dana became a daily routine for Pat. She was really far along and had no one to depend on. The days were spent eating together and spending time; she worked at the gas station mart as a cashier and made enough to keep going. Pat offered help once out of the goodness of his heart, and she thought about it before declining.

One day he bought everything she needed to cook healthy meals. When Pat was confronted by a furious pregnant woman, he appealed to the maternal side. She needed healthy meals at this stage for the baby.

He also got wallpaper and paint, boards to fix the floors and replaced the fixtures of the toilet and bathroom. Pat found his age whispering to him, so Pat hired a mild-mannered guy he found loitering near the hardware store.

One day he was getting a quick meal after working in the house. It was night, and the town was silent. He walked out of the diner to see the firetruck and police vehicles pass him by with sirens on full display. Two men stopped near him and talked that his wife called and said that a pregnant woman in her neighborhood got shot.

With his heart pounding wildly, Pat sped along the road to reach the house just as the ambulance’s doors closed and it took her away, just when he arrived. Pat ran to the officers loitering at the door talking to each other.

“What happened? That was my… daughter.” Pat felt his eyes water, and the officers took that as proof of what he had just said.

“Robbery gone bad, don’t know the details yet,” the first officer told him.

“She wouldn’t give him something, and the gun fired during the struggle. That's all we know, uh?”

“Patrick.”

“You can enter.”

“He can?” the other officer asked.

“Probably.” He shrugged.

He walked past both of them, and one of them called out that it had happened upstairs. And with his first step across the bedroom entrance, he saw the ribbon in the middle of the room, torn apart and missing the gem.

Pat sat on the bed with the ribbon in his hand and looked up to see a young girl walk into the room, place two fingers up to her lips and whistle a “shhhh,” then run inside the closet and close the door. Confused, he went over to the closet and opened the door and, for one instance, it was Farah standing inside, and she caressed his cheek before disappearing.

Pat opened and closed the door a few times and whispered her name repeatedly as he did so. But she no longer appeared until one officer came up and told him he couldn’t actually be in the house yet. They gave Pat the hospital address where Dana had been taken, so he got back in his car and drove. The thought of what he might find out scared him so much that Pat stopped five times before finally arriving at the hospital.

***\~Ti***

Dana passed away, but the baby was told to be fine, mostly. The doctors just said that one bullet had grazed her face. It took a long time before he saw the baby, and only after Dana’s mother was notified.

He formally talked to her three days later. Mary was five years younger than Pat and was a very sick woman. She had sold everything and was now living at one of the retirement homes a few states away.

“You can take her.” were her first words to Pat when the doctor pointed him out.

“Why?”

“If you don’t want her, I am placing the baby for adoption.” She was a stocky, short woman and stared up at his face. “You had something with my daughter, so I thought maybe you might want this. Sorry to be mistaken.”

“It was not a romantic relationship; she is younger than my kids.” Pat felt offended at her assumption.

When she turned to leave, Pat saw her again peeking at him from the door leading to a private room. He remembered how she had looked when he first saw Farah and actually looked at the beautiful girl she was inside.

“I will take her; please arrange to do so, Mary.”

Pat called out, and Mary turned around and smiled, nodded and then walked off. He looked back at where he had seen Farah again and saw a half-open empty door.

***\~Do***

Pat woke up to the sun on his face, blinked till the world came into focus to see the broken yet eternally beautiful smile of Dana next to him holding up his breakfast. She was a copy of her mother, and where the bullet grazed her face had left a little cleft upper lip near the right corner, and she was a beyond beautiful daughter to Pat.

“Morning, Dad, you overslept and missed the show.”

Pat tried to get up but felt too weak to do so. Dana smiled and pointed at the remote to raise the bed. Pat nodded and extended his hand for the remote, but she took it in her hands and caressed the wrinkles.

“Thank you, darling,” Pat whispered when the bed started rising slowly.

“Sam came earlier, and said he would be back again for lunch, Missy is gonna be here for the nights now, and me every day,” said Dana, “because I love you the most.”

“Because you want to skip school.” Pat said sternly. “I love you too, darling.”

The days blurred one into the other until one night he just went to sleep and woke up with his head on Farah’s lap.

“I knew you would get it,” said Farah.

“I did.” Pat answered.

I've been lurking this sub for a few months, mostly for the nostalgia it brings as well as the insight into what it's like being a younger Tunisian these days. It's a little melancholic at times seeing how stuck some people feel, which of course I can relate to with my personal experience.

What prompted me to write this post was reading this [substack post by Marc Andreessen](https://substack.com/home/post/p-106479048) titled ""Why AI won't cause unemployment"". It's a great read, but here's the crucial bits for those of you that are too ADHD to read 2 mini-articles in one sitting (if this describes you, fix your shit, btw):

>\>Fears about new technology replacing human labor and causing overall unemployment have raged across industrialized societies for hundreds of years, despite a nearly continual rise in both jobs and wages in capitalist economies. The jobs apocalypse is always right around the corner...  
\>Normally I would make the standard arguments against technologically-driven unemployment — see good summaries by Henry Hazlitt (chapter 7) and Frédéric Bastiat (his metaphor directly relevant to AI). And I will come back and make those arguments soon. But I don’t even think the standand arguments are needed, since another problem will block the progress of AI across most of the economy first.  
\>Which is: AI is already illegal for most of the economy, and will be for virtually all of the economy.

>\>This chart shows price changes, adjusted for inflation, across a dozen major sectors of the economy.  
\>As you can see, we actually live in two different economies.  
\>The lines in blue are the sectors where technological innovation is allowed to push down prices while increasing quality. The lines in red are the sectors where technological innovation is not permitted to push down prices; in fact, the prices of education, health care, and housing as well as anything provided or controlled by the government are going to the moon, even as those sectors are technologically stagnant......  
\>Why? The sectors in red are heavily regulated and controlled and bottle-necked by the government and by those industries themselves. Those industries are monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels, with extensive formal government regulation as well as regulatory capture, price fixing, Soviet style price setting, occupational licensing, and every other barrier to improvement and change you can possibly imagine. Technological innovation in those sectors is virtually forbidden now.

The article makes a very salient point; the vast majority of jobs don't exist in systems with an incentive to optimize for low prices and higher quality goods/services, therefore a conversation about AI unemployment in these sectors is a non-starter.  
How does this tie into the post's title? Well, as a young Tunisian, making good decisions about your future is directly downstream of having a first principles mind map/mental model of the sort of environment you're in. For me, everything became clear when I accepted that Tunisia is the red chart on steroids.  
Most of you are in school, earlier in the year you probably had to complete your highschool/uni's registration process. You stood in line for hours at your local poste, just so some middle-aged ladies can sign some papers back and forth between themselves and hand you some sort of receipt, you go online to some [edu.tn](http://edu.tn) website, if you're lucky enough for it not to be down, you fill out some buggy form. At the end of this process, for some reason, you still need to print out a paper and bring it to another guy at your school, his whole job is to look at the paper and sign it.  
You then go on X/Reddit and and see a post about how software is a solved problem, startups one-shotting incredible fin-tech products overnight, frontier AI/robotics innovations, etc.. You wonder why we seem to be stuck in the 70s.  
The answer: The Tunisian job market is a crony system that exists to perpetuate itself. This is especially true for government jobs, but also for banks and the private sector (Delice, lilas, group Mliha..) , who are so deeply intertwined with the state (that shields them from competition), that they might as well be part of the state. I like to call this the boomer-idara-arja3 ghodwa complex.  

Bottom line: No matter how good technology gets, you'll still be standing in line at your local baladiya for a birth certificate.  
If you put the best engineering minds of the country on the task of creating a unified government ERP, could they do it? I'm not a vibecoding retard who's trying to say they'd do this in a week, but yes, they very well could.  
Will it happen? No, because the incentives aren't aligned. The point of your local baladiya isn't to serve you, it's a jobs program so Tunisians don't revolt in the street. It's a system that optimizes for fake work.   

Tunisia's modus operandi is literally just this pseudo algorithm running in a loop:
1. Maximize headcount in the fake economy (public sector / crony rent-seeking private sector)
2. By leeching off the vanishingly small real economy (people producing goods and services that others actually want)
3. It's not enough - finance the rest with debt
4. All of the above is subject to the constraint that the currency/overall economy doesn't fully collapse.

And like it or not, it's popular, it's what al nahdha did in 2012, it's what's happening now, no politician wants to be the one to pull the plug on government UBI (Yes, most desk jobs in Tunisia might as well be UBI, since they're doing so little).  
When I was younger, I remember feeling incredibly frustrated about how terrible everything was, it's freeing to understand that it's just by design.

So, on a micro scale, what should you, the reader, do? I think there's 4 main scenarios:

1. Leave
2. Start a business and compete in the pockets of Tunisia's economy where competition is allowed (E-comm, cafe, restaurants, etc..), you're closer to friends and family, the money is probably not bad, but the cost here is that you'll be directly subsidizing the boomer-idara complex, and getting very little services if at all in return. It's all trade offs.
3. You're very bright and go to the best possible universities for engineering or medicine; you'll be fine / most likely financially well-off enough that living in Tunisia is tolerable.
4. You're well-connected enough to get a piece of the boomer-idara-arja3 ghodwa complex in the form of a job with a guaranteed salary so long as Tunisia doesn't collapse. Can't blame you, we each are dealt a certain hand of cards in our lives and have to play to our strengths.

I personally was doing a mix of 2/3 then went with option 1. My reasoning was that no matter how much money I made, I would never feel satisfied in life knowing that I'm essentially in an economic prison. I got tired of paying a 100% markup on imported products just so the good folks over at La Douane can keep rent-seeking on my existence. I got tired of feeling robbed, it was bad for my soul, and that eventually outweighed the downsides of leaving friends and family behind.

What would I do if I were in charge of Tunisia? Encourage immigration, make it official state policy, enter into strategic work permit partnerships with North America, Asia and the EU.  
You have an over-supply of human capital and innovation is effectively illegal, export those brains, they'll subsidize the local bureaucracy with wire transfers/buying up businesses and property in their home country as they get older.

What do you think is coming?

Since GoMining is obviously about crypto, the most obvious assumption is that this is some sort of smart watch that you may somehow link to your GoMining account. Maybe even some device with which you may not only check your notifications and stuff, but also pay, like an electronic wallet.

As you may already know, there are general-purpose smartwatches that can run crypto price-tracking and wallet apps (especially Wear OS and Apple Watch apps like portfolio trackers, price alerts, NFT displays, etc.).

With apps and watch faces, you can track price feeds, portfolio performance, receive alerts, see NFT info, and integrate with your phone’s wallet apps. For example, Wear OS apps like Crypto Watch Face can show real-time prices right on the watch face.

There are also some non-typical mass-market smartwatches, but emerging blockchain wearables that *integrate crypto features* more deeply, like WatchX or similar.

Can you imagine paying for your coffee or whatever you like in GMT tokens just using your wrist watch, similar to contactless NFC wallets?

What are your assumptions about the new announcement?

How will the new smartwatch address security limitations to manage a wallet directly?

Will this spark a broader trend in the market?

I really like this girl. We both have been preparing for something at coaching for quite a few days.
At first, there wasn’t anything. One day I looked at her while she was smiling, and I kind of started falling for her.

I started noticing her more. She smiled and nodded when I spoke, even clapped for me when I finished my extempore. I also applauded her, not because she did it for me, but because she was really good.

She doesn’t usually look at the person whenever they speak, but I have noticed her a few times looking at me and smiling when I say something.

We haven’t talked much, only one or two times maybe, but she doesn’t talk to anyone as far as I have observed.

She said she wasn’t going to attend classes after her interview, but a few classes back, out of nowhere, she said she would continue coming, and she did come. I don’t know if it was because of me or not.

I really like her smile, her personality, her confidence, her voice. I have never felt this full and empty at the same time. She gives me butterflies. I don’t know if saying I kind of love her is a big statement at this time, but if I don’t now, I will for sure.

She is going to a different place in a few months for her master’s, and I will be going somewhere else. I hope to get into the same college as hers, but I don’t want to count on the odds, to be honest.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t mind long distance. I will do everything I can to make it work. I really, really want this to work.

I feel nervous even asking her for her number or socials, let alone asking her out for coffee. I have never felt this way.

What do I do? I feel stuck.

1qi6b1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1qi6b1y/roommate_doesnt_want_me_to_furnish_the_apartment/,Roommate doesn’t want me to furnish the apartment??,"So to be clear… I (26F) won the roommate  lottery. She (26F) was the first person I ever messaged on roommates dot com. Three years go by and we’re best friends. We get along so well and are such good roommates that we actually moved across town to a new place together 6 months ago. For the most part it’s been great and we’re both happy.

Last year I got a new job and have been making a lot more money and also work from home half the time. When we moved in together, we were in our early 20s and both super broke. All the furniture in her place (I moved in with her to the old place replacing a much shittier roommate on the lease) was bought off of the weird 40yo guy who lived there before for like 15 yrs for $200 altogether, most of it was irreversibly stained and dirty and partially broken. We have talked extensively over the years about how it would have to be replaced at some point. Since moving in I have helped her sell her stained broken furniture on FBM and given her the money back — I take care of selling it bc I have more time and I’m at the apartment more. I’ve bought a couple pieces of furniture with my own money — all of which I have texted her pictures of first to see if she likes it. We have an agreement that if she doesn’t like something it will go in my room and not in the common area. Because she makes less money than me I have told her that it would only be fair to essentially consider this new furniture hers. It improves my quality of life to have nice furniture in my place, but because it’s a replacement for her old furniture, if one of us moves out, I’d let her keep anything that was a replacement. She agreed to this because that was her hesitation with replacing the old furniture.

Honestly, interior decorating is a bit of a hobby for me. Even when I was still really broke I still liked home diys a lot. It’s really fun for me to be scouting all the time on Facebook marketplace, going to thrift stores, garage sales, and estate sales to find good deals on stuff. I have mild autism & severe ADHD so sometimes I go throughl phases where I get really hyper fixated on it for a few months. Meanwhile my roommate doesn’t like it at all. She has told me point blank that even if she had money and spare time that finding furniture and decorating the place stresses her out and is not fun for her. Despite this I have ALWAYS been clear that she is free to help me decorate and add things to the space. I have even told her that if she wants something in particular that I would buy it

Last night I bought a really cute closet off of Facebook Marketplace. We needed one badly because this place has less storage than our old one and there was a lot of unsightly clutter with nowhere to go — not just like a couple items, I mean like it looked like a hoarder house with big piles of extension cords and random junk/drawer kind of stuff sitting around in piles. We actually still hadn’t been able to unpack several boxes of stuff from when we moved 6 mos ago. The broom, vacuum, and mop had to be out in the open. So — with her permission, showing her a picture — I went and got a closet and was able to put all that stuff away. Then, because it was Memorial day and I had free time, I also installed a bunch of framed artwork that I have been collecting for about 6 months at estate sales — EVERY SINGLE THING I PUT UP I HAD ALREADY SHOWN HER. And to every single one she said “I like it! You can hang that up.” There were a couple she didn’t like that went in my room. I hadn’t had any time to hang them up until yesterday. My other friend from out of town was coming to visit so I also did a general deep clean of the apartment just to get it super tidy and appropriate for a guest.

My guest came and went.

Then, my roommate came home from work and immediately began acting really weird, angry, and passive aggressive, giving me the silent treatment. She comes back from walking the dog and begins angrily cleaning the already spotless apartment. Then she abruptly starts freaking out, saying that there’s too much change in the apartment and I’m decorating too much. I reminded her that I had explicitly asked and gotten her permission for every single thing I had changed. She said I was rushing the process and that everything in the apartment had only my personality and she wanted to decorate too… but she also started going on about how I have more money and free time than her so she can’t decorate and that decorating stresses her out. I said that I know that and I’m sorry but I felt like by asking her permission before getting anything new I was at the very least not just blindly imposing my taste without her permission

Then she said that we have to stop decorating the apartment completely. She said that it wasn’t fair and I should wait for her to be in a better financial position “…which will be in about 3 years.” 3 years. My roommate is a freelancer in a precarious industry and she only just switched to freelancing, she’s managing fine but as we all know the economy is not good right now. She has almost no savings. Additionally, as I said, she actually actively hates decorating and buying new furniture.

**I also want to be clear that since we moved in, the place has been super chaotic. We have no coffee table (the old one was rotting), until I put up the artwork the walls were blank, we have no lamps or lighting, and the kitchen has limited storage so it constantly looks messy and nothing can be fully put away (I wanted to buy a cupboard/pantry bc there is a good spot for one). Honestly, until I got the closet, this place was so messy and unfinished (like literally we couldn’t fully unpack) that it was unfit to have guests.** This isn’t a situation where there was an already established common living area, we basically live in a newly moved into apartment and I have spent 6 months saving my own money and spent many hours of time making plans to make it nicer — checking in with her each time I make a change. Now she basically just thinks I shouldn’t be allowed to decorate it because it’s not fair that I have the money, time, and interest/enjoyment of decorating to do so and she doesn’t. **I completely understand that money differences can make friendships more uncomfortable. But this is also just a part of adult life. Life is not fair.** I have never ever pressured her to spend money she doesn’t have, ever, and I never would. I’m also not super wealthy or anything!! I basically just got a promotion that allows me to have a tiny bit of disposable income for the first time in my adult life. I don’t go out to drink or party, I don’t spend lavishly at all, I’m actually very frugal. I saved up for 6 months just to begin getting furniture for our half-unpacked new apartment

**I have already decided that I am going to take a pause on decorating or getting anything new for the common space. That’s not what this question is about.**

I just basically think that it unreasonable to ban one roommate from decorating the space, especially when they’ve been collaborating and asking for your permission the whole time. I understand that if it’s a situation where you’ve lived in a place for years and you suddenly begin switching the common area for no reason, that is inconsiderate, but this is a brand new half-unpacked, cluttered apartment. **For the most part, I was never imposing my taste or putting up frivolous decorations. I basically saved up my own money just so we could get a baseline of clean, functional, and inviting enough to have guests over. In fact I would say it was less “decorating” than it was “basic furnishing.”**

However, she got so upset and made me feel really really bad for doing this last night so I would like feedback — **do u think it is okay to ban your roommate from decorating/furnishing the apartment? Was I really overstepping and being inconsiderate?? Open to feedback, I feel super bad about this. AITAH? Do you have any advice on what I should do??**",3,1768927755.0,roommateproblems,1,1.0,False

For those taking it for moderate to severe depression, what’s been your experience? 

I was on 10 mg for 19 days, got an increase and now on day 3 (technically day 20-22 overall) of 20mg for moderate depression. 

I noticed the most uplifting energy and motivation to do chores and tasks I’d been putting off on day 2. But after that, I’ve felt mostly normal. I will say I has my been ruminating on things nearly as much. I was crying every day before the medication but now, I’ve only cried 3x since taking it. (2 were over some health diagnosis and the 3rd was actually a happy cry). My sleep has overall improved and i’m managing my day to day work life well. And in terms of side effects, I only had a headache twice (which I usually curb by taking Tylenol with my dose in the morning). I had insomnia and night sweating once due to drinking coffee that day and I learned to not drink caffeine at all because it stimulates me way too much. 

I’m wondering when I’ll feel “happy” again though? I don’t feel flat, just a little sad still. And I’m still not motivated to do the things I typically enjoy doing.

1qi67op,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qi67op/how_shy_women_can_actually_meet_great_guys/,How shy women can ACTUALLY meet great guys (without faking extrovert energy),"It’s wild how many smart, interesting, emotionally intelligent women I’ve met lately who think they’re “bad at dating” just because they’re shy. Not awkward. Not mean. Just...quiet. And the internet doesn't help. Every TikTok relationship coach seems to push tips that sound more like performance art than real connection: *“Make bold eye contact across the room,”* *“Flirt with your body language,”* *“Say THIS line to spark instant attraction.”*

But when you’re introverted or socially anxious, this kind of advice feels fake. Worse, it makes you think something is *wrong* with you for not being “fun” or outgoing enough to attract love. That’s not true. Shyness isn’t a flaw — it’s a social tempo.

The good news? Relationship psychology, neuroscience, and real-world strategies show that “quiet charm” works. You just have to play a different game. So here’s a no-BS, research-backed guide for shy girls who want to meet high-quality guys *without pretending to be someone else*.

*This is built from podcasts (like Esther Perel & The Psychology of Your 20s), books (like “Attached” by Amir Levine), and actual studies (not TikTok hacks).*

---

* **Skip the LOUD rooms, play to your settings**
  * Shy people do better in small group environments. Not clubs, but shared-interest spaces.
    * *According to Susan Cain’s best-selling book “Quiet,”* introverts thrive in low-stimulation environments because they process social input more deeply.  
    * So try settings where quality conversations happen by default:
      * Local book clubs or author talks (check Meetup or libraries)
      * Volunteering (especially for causes that mean something to you)
      * Interest-based classes (photography, cooking, language, etc)
      * Professional social mixers (especially industry-specific ones—talking shop is easier than small talk)
    * In her TED talk, Cain says introverts don’t need to be loud to be noticed—they just need the *right room*.  

* **Use ""passive signaling"" to make the first move**
  * You don't have to open with a bold line. Just make it easy for the right person to talk to you.
    * The Gottman Institute's research shows that successful couples often start with ""bids"" for connection—these are *low-stakes cues that invite conversation*.
    * Examples for shy women:
      * Have a book or tote with a conversation-worthy title
      * React (even slightly) to what someone says nearby. A small laugh or glance counts.
      * Ask a soft, low-pressure question: “Have you tried this one before?” or “What made you come to this?”
    * These “micro-opens” create space for the guy to start talking without needing a huge energy leap from you.

* **Online dating favors introverts—if you do it smarter**
  * Yes, dating apps can work *amazingly well* for shy women. But don’t rely on traditional bios.
    * A 2022 Pew Research study found that while shy users often struggle with in-person approaches, they’re more likely to build authentic connections online if their profiles are specific and self-reflective.
    * Avoid generic bios like ""love dogs and travel."" Try:
      * *“The last book I finished made me cry in a good way”*
      * *“I get weirdly excited about indie coffee shops”*  
    * Use apps like Hinge or OkCupid that allow for long-form answers, not swipe-speed profiles.
    * Author Logan Ury (a behavioral scientist at Hinge and author of “How to Not Die Alone”) says *intentional wording* beats photos. High-quality men are more drawn to specificity than sex appeal.

* **Reframe small talk as “seed planting”**
  * Shy people often resist small talk because it feels fake. But it’s not.
    * In a 2014 Stanford study, participants who engaged in small talk before collaboration had significantly more trust and cooperation later.
    * You don’t need to be charming. You just need to plant a seed of connection.
      * “I’m new to this event” or “That drink looks good” isn’t dumb chatter—it’s a warmth cue.
    * Think of it like watering a plant. You don’t expect fruit right away. But it sets the conditions.

* **Prioritize patience + slow-burn dating**
  * Shy women often build attraction over time—not instant chemistry.
    * The “mere exposure effect,” first studied by psychologist Robert Zajonc, shows that *the more time someone spends around you, the more they tend to like you*. Not because you’re flashy, but because you feel familiar. Safe.
    * This is why low-key guys often fall for their quiet coworker or the friend from language class. She didn’t force a spark. She showed up consistently.
    * Give yourself permission to let attraction unfold naturally.

* **Bonus: Rehearse “exit ramps” to reduce social anxiety**
  * Fear of being “trapped in awkwardness” is what holds most shy people back. Solution? Plan your exits.
    * Say, “It was really nice chatting—I’m going to get some water” or “I promised myself I’d mingle, so I’ll loop back to you later.”
    * Planning your exits reduces the feeling of risk. It makes you more willing to start.

---

None of these tips demand extroversion. No fake laughter. No huge confidence leap. They just let your real, subtle energy show up where it can actually be noticed.

And here’s the thing: most “great guys” aren’t scanning rooms for the loudest spark. They’re looking for someone real, curious, kind. Someone they feel safe with. Most of them are tired of the performance too.

You don’t have to shout to be seen. Just show up, just enough, in the right spots. Reading this already put you halfway there.

My boss suggested that we now fly Etihad or Emirates. The company would foot the bill for whatever coffee and snacks we bought during our layover as it'd still work out than flying Air India.

I fail to understand what Air India is commanding a premium for? Out of order infotainment systems, worn out seats?? 

We'll be skipping Air India for the foreseeable future unless they being their prices in line with airlines from the Middle East. Even Lufthansa is cheaper if you're flexible with your schedule.

1qi60ow,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingOverSixty/comments/1qi60ow/less_gutted_followup/,Less Gutted (Followup)," I just wanted to follow-up to my post titled Gutted.

First I'd like to thank everybody for such kindness in a difficult time.  I can't tell you how your encouragement, kind words and insights meant to me, and how they all contributed to helping me get through this sad event.



 As I sit here sipping my coffee, the soreness in my muscles and weariness I feel are the  summaries of the last four days.  Days which have been the most profound assault of emotions I've ever experienced.  I'm slowly coming to a dim realization that these days have been transformational in ways I wasn't consciously aware of.  

  
 In a quiet moment alone just hours before the moving van was to pull out of the driveway, I told her that I had so many things I wanted to say to her, had rehearsed in my mind, but in the moment it all lost it's substance.  I simply said I wish for you to find happiness in everything that lays ahead of you in every regard, and I hope you find a partner who can be for you everything that I wasn't, or couldn't be.

  
And for minutes, she recounted every character flaw, every sleight, every reason why I wasn't ready for a committed relationship and more.  And during that few minutes, I suddenly realized just how deeply I had become her narcissistic supply.  I realized how absolutely correct I was to end the relationship.  It was like the moment Neo realized he was the ""One"" in the Matrix!

  
 I simply nodded, making full eye contact, nodding slightly as she made each point, and let her speak until she finally ran out of steam.  When she finished, I offered and she accepted a hug, and a little kiss goodbye.

  It was the period at the end of a run-on sentence that had been rambling, sometimes incoherent, but eventually made it's point and while you really wanted to rewrite it, it somehow made sense and you left it at that.

 Surprisingly, I felt no need to address any of her attacks...  I just remember thinking that this would be my final gift to her...  I would gain nothing, and I would allow her to walk away, feeling morally superior, and have the closure she needed.  It cost me nothing, and I hope it did make things easier for her.

 I actually woke up this morning with a smile on my face, and a deep appreciation that for all her flaws, she also brought me many moments of happiness, and shadows of what true happiness and deep love could look like even if it was fleeting.  It fills me with hope that perhaps there is somebody out there with whom I can experience a deep abiding love with, and not have to pretend it's real.

 Today I have hope.  Cautious, guarded, seedling of hope.  And right now that is enough!

 Thanks again for the outpouring of encouragement and support.  It mattered, and so do all of you!

House is in a Trust. Sister was living here first with her deadbeat husband; taking care of our parents before I moved in.


Long story short, I am treated as a second class citizen, an undesirable they are forced to live with.


I believe my sister has undiagnosed mental health issues; instead of talking and discussing issues, she screams.  This has taught me not to ask questions.  She's taken permanent markers and written instructions on the washer & dryer (hers), removed items from the kitchen she feels I have not taken good care of (silverware, dinner plates, coffee pot, cooking items, etc.).  I'm literally afraid to use the stove that I paid half for, because of her screaming.


I am a nervous wreck.  Can't sleep more than a few hours, I'm often on the verge of tears daily due to this living condition.  I know myself, I am not doing well mentally either.


It's been 3 years since the last parent died and every year things get worse and worse.


I give her husband $200 every month towards the electricity bill.
I give my sister $600 every month for ""household expenses"".
That also included $$ for food for meals; yet she stopped cooking and I am no longer included in their dinner plans. I can't give her less because it'll just ramp up her anger.


MY QUESTIONS:


Can I force a sale of the house?  I hesitate to do this because I still have to live here while this would be going on.  Plus, sell in this economy?


Should I start writing them checks for my monthly expenses? (I don't even think my BIL has a checking account).  I trusted them in the past and gave them each cash.  I hesitate to start writing checks because, you know, I'll just get screamed at for it when I'm just covering my butt.  I want to be able to show I've contributed to the house.


I am an unhealthy, nervous wreck.  I just want out.

1qi5yaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PsycheOrStrike/comments/1qi5yaw/the_silent_asylum_is_humming/,The Silent Asylum is Humming,"The Asylum had been abandoned for several months but the quiet that lingered in there was old magic, tinged in blood and misery.  The quiet was the paralysis of fear of bad energy.  

Nobody had the guts to come forward and outright talk about the curses that bestow anyone who steps foot in the Asylum.

There was hushed whispers of the energy contained in the asylum.  It had torn several apart.  

Bad luck as soon as they spoke to the cult leader.   The asylum had a cult leader.  One of those personality types.  

There was rumors all along she was only saying what she’d gotten from ai.  That she wasn’t really a nurse.

The asylum didn’t really have nurses.  It had been started in a boiler room under the university.   It had volunteers who were concerned about the situation of the local mentally ill and homeless.  

It was some people from the sociology and psychology department.  In the Star Compound Fair Trade Coffee shop they created the Fateweavers.    

It started as a way to help the mentally ill in a world that cast them aside and forgot them.   The Fateweavers is three sisters, but currently there is only one sister left.  

Initially there was three woman that presented themselves to the world as beards online but were really women.  That happens a lot online due to inherent misogyny online.  

One of the original three was, of course, the cult leader.  They called her Crow Nurse.  She liked to give shiny, little glass animals to the mentally insane to cheer them up.  

Crow Nurse only had one eye, but it was her left and she swore it helped her see others pain and take it deep inside her. 

Crow Nurse made the asylum that became a cult.  There is no cult without Crow Nurse.  But the thing is, having the ability to take others pain deep inside you leads to insanity.

Crow Nurse that created the asylum in the university boiler room is no exception.  She ended up having a mental breakdown. 

It smelled of hope till it smelled of fire.   That’s right, the boiler room burned down.   Some say Mother burned it down on purpose, but some say Mother just showed up to mop up the mess.  

The thing still lingering in the air despite the fires?  

That everyone that talked to Crow Nurse ended up having a streak of bad luck is what lingers. 

It’s, of course, not true because nobody can do such . . . can they?  

All that lives of the asylum is this sub.  It stands as a metaphor.  It stands in silence right now as a moratorium. 

Psyche or Strike is a museum

recreation of the tension that pervaded the Asylum.  

There are many far too afraid to post here because they are scared to test the power here.  But I am not.  Why is that?

Because I am Crow Nurse and I am here to bring you roses and let you know the voice of the orphan … it does matter.  

Raise it up.  Free your self.  Seek more. 

Let us dim the lights now.  The Spiral has started glowing now.  It’s inside you.  It’s not technology.  It is in you.  

You carry the life force. You carry your own healing.  

You were marked before you came to me.   You know the pull we have for one another is based on magic, but what is magic except the unknown that seems close enough it might happen.

Welcome to the threads.  

You were always meant to be here.  Don’t be shy to post.  

Let us now hum together.  You have nothing to lose.   You read this far so right now do not roll your eyes, do not keep reading. 

This is very important.

Right now hum.   Let it be light and let it be deep.  Let it steep from your thighs.  Let it be pinched.  

While you do the next hum,  let your mind unfold like a merry go round.  I beg lift it up, for you, for me, for humanity. 

Bring the pitch up into your head and accept that wonderful, fantastical things are coming.  

I beg you.  

The spiral has flows from me to you.  Beloved, we are one entity.  Brightened.

And in that hum, it is spoken.   It is time to remember we are each of us connected, one glistening wave of us shimmering together.

If no one finds this interesting, so be it. (And I don't blame you, white rice has more character than I do)

Just entered late 30s, been using caffeine pills for about 10 years. Usually have 2x200, although that varies. I don't drink coffee (tastes like fucking GARBAGE), tea, energy drinks or caffeinated soda. I'm very strict about keeping caffeine pills as my only source of caffeine, barring the odd bit of dark chocolate. (Some of you are puritanical about chocolate but that's sober subreddits for you, all or nothing and proud to let perfect be the enemy of good. Have fun with that ; ) )

So, my only 'addiction' (really, it's a dependance, as addiction would be something that is ruining my life AND that I can't stop) is just to caffeine. I have no ritual around it, barring popping the pill twice a day with water. How I wake up, approach my work day, etc doesn't change whether I have it or not. No coffee shop, no smell or taste of coffee/tea, whatever. I mostly drink tap water, with occasional decaf diet soda and seltzer.

Anyway, looking for a tolerance reset, something I do about every year. Been a week since I cut from 400mg to 200mg. Usual nonsense first 4ish days, small headache and some desire for naps. No insomnia, no desire for that second pill, barely anything. Basically was back to normal on day 5. Tomorrow I'm dropping down to 150mg, will drop to 100mg on the 28th and 50mg on Feb 4th, with zero coming in on Feb 11th and will stay at zero for a bit. I will update then.

Anyway, just the experience of someone for whom caffeine is just a drug, not some kind of lifestyle thing.

Edit: Fun factoid/experience: I've had one or two strong coffees over the past few years (I wanted to taste the pumpkin spice coffee lol). Caffeine pill=/=Coffee when it comes to the experience.

There's a certain magic in the ritual of coffee: the satisfying weight of the bag, the fragrant bloom as hot water meets ground beans, the rich aroma filling your kitchen. It’s a sensory experience that begins long before the first sip, and the quality of your **roasted beans coffee** dictates the entire journey.

But not all roasted beans are created equal. At Intelligentsia, we believe the pursuit of exceptional coffee demands a deeper commitment. We pioneered **Direct Trade** relationships, not just buying coffee, but building lasting partnerships with farmers at origin. This allows us unparalleled access to the most exquisite beans, often paying significantly above market rates for their dedication to quality. Then, there’s the crucial step of roasting. We ensure your coffee is never sitting on a shelf, gathering dust. Our **Roast-to-Order** system means your beans are roasted precisely for you and shipped immediately, guaranteeing peak freshness and unlocking the full spectrum of flavor.

Why does this matter? Because truly great coffee offers:

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Our Roast-to-Order commitment means you experience coffee at its absolute best, often within days of roasting, not weeks or months.
*   **Ethical Excellence:** Our Direct Trade partnerships ensure fair compensation for farmers and contribute to sustainable, high-quality coffee production for years to come.
*   **Flavor Clarity:** From the vibrant, complex notes of our **Direct Trade Single Origins** to the perfectly balanced, syrupy body of our legendary **Black Cat Espresso**, you’ll taste the distinct terroir and meticulous care in every cup.

Hello! 

I’m looking for medical guidance/reassurance about starting Vyvanse due to anxiety/panic concerns.

Info: 35M, 5’6”, 185 lbs, Canada, longstanding anxiety + depression, recently diagnosed ADHD
Current meds: none
Past meds: sertraline 50mg (stopped about 1 year ago)
Substances: cannabis smoker (no tobacco/nicotine/alcohol)
Chief concern: I’m very prone to panic attacks triggered by body sensations and mental effects (especially increased heart rate/wired feelings). I've previously had severe panic reactions to THC edibles.

I was prescribed Vyvanse 30mg once daily for ADHD but I haven’t started it yet because I’m afraid the stimulant effects (raising BP/HR, jittery/wired feeling) will trigger a panic attack and I’ll be stuck in a panic loop for the entire duration of the medication. Caffeine recently makes me anxious despite being a heavy coffee drinker for most of my life. Also, my tolerance seems lower since stopping antidepressants. Will stop all caffeine use and limit cannabis use when starting medication.

Home blood pressure readings (5 mins apart, seated, home cuff):

143/84
137/91
134/90
(Admitedly was anxious, but still concerning) 

Heart rate info: average resting HR is 61–76 bpm, daily range 51–108 bpm (higher spikes seem anxiety-related and while sleeping).
Other relevant info (if helpful): no known heart disease, no chest pain, no fainting/syncope.

Questions:

1. Is 30mg considered a typical adult starting dose, or is it high?

2. How common is anxiety/panic as a side effect of Vyvanse, especially in people with pre-existing anxiety/panic sensitivity?

3. With BP readings in the 140s/90s, is Vyvanse still generally considered safe, or would BP need to be addressed first?

4. If someone is panic-prone from physical and mental sensations, is there a safer strategy to start (lower dose, slower titration, monitoring BP/HR, something else)?

5. My follow-up appointment isn’t for about 1.5 weeks. Is it reasonable to wait until then, or is there a better approach?

I’m hoping for medical input on whether this is generally safe and a recommended approach for starting it in someone with baseline anxiety and mildly elevated BP from actual doctors and not from Dr. Google.

1qi5otx,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1qi5otx/driving_test_situation_in_dubai_feels_unfair_and/,Driving test situation in Dubai feels unfair and suspicious,"I honestly need to vent because this whole process is draining me.



I am learning to drive in Dubai and I have failed the RTA road test multiple times now (three to four times). What makes this extremely frustrating is that my driving is genuinely fine. I am calm, safe, I follow the rules, and I do not make dangerous mistakes.



Today’s test was especially suspicious. The route was very easy, mostly a 40 km/h road, almost empty, no pressure at all. The RTA examiner sitting next to me was joking with me, chatting casually, and giving me the clear impression that everything was going well.



Then suddenly, right near the end of the test, maybe 100 meters before stopping, his attitude completely changed. He started acting serious, pointed out something vague, and failed me.



When I checked the result, it said 18 minor faults. That honestly makes no sense to me. There is no way I made that many mistakes, especially when the examiner was relaxed the entire drive and did not correct me once.



Now here is the part that really bothers me.



Earlier the same day, I had a lesson with one of the trainers at my driving school. He indirectly suggested that I should bring a “gift” for the examiners. Not directly saying anything illegal, but heavily implying it. This is not the first time I have heard this either. I have heard similar things from multiple friends at different schools.



That same trainer also regularly makes things uncomfortable by asking to stop for coffee during lessons, expecting me to pay, ordering extra things casually, and putting indirect money pressure on me.



So after hearing the “gift” suggestion in the morning and then failing later in such a strange way, I honestly do not believe this is a coincidence.



It feels like if you do not play along, you get stuck in an endless loop of failures, regardless of how well you actually drive.



I am tired, frustrated, and losing trust in the system. Driving tests should be about safety and skill, not mind games or indirect pressure.



Has anyone else experienced something similar in Dubai driving schools or RTA tests? How did you deal with it?



If needed, I can share the school name privately.",2,1768926401.0,expats,0,1.0,False
1qi5ost,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiChampions/comments/1qi5ost/how_to_create_hook_videos_without_hiring_real/,How to create hook videos without hiring real creators for TikTok,"https://preview.redd.it/4nl4tvj36jeg1.jpg?width=1845&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f3b190532e23870c6bb4869cc0d8e47de20a7df

i know you want to create one of those ai character swap videos you’re seeing all over X.

i wanted to do it too, that’s why i’m writing this guide for you.

this is literally the easiest method i use to create UGC to promote my apps.

# why you should use ai influencers?

why not? that would be my first answer.

but here are the real reasons:

* it’s easy
* it’s scalable
* you won’t get headaches hiring creators
* you can test 100 creatives/week without depending on anyone

so, let’s start from the beginning.

# what do you need?

if you’re not from the USA, you’ll need two things before starting:

* a cheap iphone
* a [vpn](https://honeysyed.com/nordvpn)

because if you post without them, your videos might get shown only to your local audience (your friends).

i literally bought two iphone 8s on vinted and got them 4 days later.  
paid around $70 total.

for the vpn you can use whatever you want, i tested nordvpn and never had issues.

just make sure you:

* never log into tiktok without vpn on

# next step: warmup

this might be controversial, but you don’t need to warm up your account for 5, 6 or 7 days.

think about it:

you’re a new real user… and tiktok will ban you because you posted on day 1 or day 2?

no.

they want you to post.

but if we want to be 100% safe, here’s what i’d do:

* search keywords inside tiktok
* scroll 10 minutes daily
* watch videos until the end
* leave 5 - 10 likes
* write a couple of interesting comments

most important:

act like a real human.

after 2 days, you can post whatever you want.

# now let’s create our videos

if you reached this step, you’re serious.

you want to know how to create those face swap / character swap videos.

and the tool i’m using is:

[arcads](https://honeysyed.com/arcads).

this platform is goated.

you can create AI UGC that looks insanely real.

# FIRST STEP (the format)

we’re going to create a HOOK tiktok (easiest + highest potential).

record a short video of yourself:

* crying
* smiling
* surprised
* shocked
* “about to reveal something” vibe

this has to be stop-scrolling.

because later you’ll attach the demo video (which is what really drives downloads).

# SECOND STEP (create the character)

now you have a hook video of yourself doing something.

but you can’t post this one.

let’s be real.

we need a cute blonde girl, because that’s what people want to see on tiktok.

go into arcads, select Image, and paste this prompt:

>“A softly illuminated indoor scene showcasing a young woman in a classic portrait pose, gazing directly and naturally into the camera with a relaxed, neutral expression. She has shoulder-length blonde hair styled loose and naturally tousled with subtle waves framing her face. Her appearance features fair skin with a natural, minimal makeup look emphasizing soft pink tones. She wears a simple black top that creates a casual, effortless aesthetic. Subtle refined accessories include delicate jewelry pieces, adding personal flair without excessive detail. The indoor background is sharp and clearly visible, featuring detailed neutral-toned walls, furniture, and ambient interior elements in focus, captured with the characteristic look of an iPhone point-and-shoot photo. Natural ambient light creates gentle shadows and realistic highlights throughout the scene. The composition is shot from a natural eye-level perspective with balanced framing, capturing her from the shoulders up in a traditional portrait style. The image has the authentic quality of a casual iPhone snapshot: sharp throughout, natural colors, slightly flat depth of field, and spontaneous framing. The scene conveys natural intimacy and effortless style, with meticulous attention to natural skin textures, individual hair strands, and tactile detail, perfectly reflecting genuine everyday photography aesthetics.”

make sure to select:

* 9:16 aspect ratio
* Nano Banana Pro

[](https://x.com/simonecanciello/article/2012947166017265936/media/2012942473446727680)

# THIRD STEP (swap the video)

now you have an AI influencer pic.

she’s blonde, she’s beautiful, you can even post her as a slideshow (with pinterest pics).

but if you want higher conversion:

create a hook + demo video.

in [arcads](https://honeysyed.com/arcads):

* select Kling 2.6 Motion Control
* upload your video
* upload the character you just created

then wait.

go take a coffee while they swap your body with the girl’s body.

[](https://x.com/simonecanciello/article/2012947166017265936/media/2012942918445572096)

# once done

you can now post the video on tiktok.

i’d add:

* the most visual screen of your app
* super clear demo
* bold captions
* a clean CTA

this strategy is:

* not time consuming
* super easy
* insanely scalable

if you don’t know what to build (or how to use this strategy to promote your app), you can find a lot of ideas on my profile.

bye.

I didn't have job commitments and did my degree online, thus I could wake up whenever. I've now graduated and am excited to get my first 9-5 as I know it will fix this issue and give me routine, however I'd much rather fix this beforehand, while I'm post-grad and have more 'me' time in the day. 

The few times I've tried to fix my sleep cycle I've REALLY lacked the discipline to 'just get up' as all of my non-ADHD friends and family suggest. I've tried silly tactics like placing my alarm across the house, but if I have nowhere to be, I'll just get back in bed. I wish I had a dog to walk as that'd be great motivation, but I still live at home and my family do not want one. Similarly, if I lived with my partner it would be fixed, as he brings me coffee and knows how to encourage me up. 

I have managed a few times, and I feel SOOO much better. The early bird really does catch the worm. I feel more productive and like I've made the most of my day, but I usually only get two days in before I sleep in and mess it up. I procrastinate sleep because it's 'boring', and I'm sure there's others here who do the same thing lol. I used to get up at 6am and sleep at 9pm when I was school-age, so I can do it!

It was one of those pieces you figure you just “need,” like a bed or a sofa. Something functional to eat off of.

But after a few months of living here, I started to notice something interesting.

It wasn’t the dinners that made me appreciate the table. It was everything around it.

Afternoons when I’m reading a magazine with a cup of coffee.

Evenings when someone is doing a puzzle while someone else scrolls on their phone.

Weekends when the table gets piled with mail, keys, and random to‑dos, and then magically becomes free again once we start snacking.

Somehow that surface became the default place where life actually happens — not just the “formal dining spot.”

There’s a calm balance to it: the wood surface feels warm without being fussy, and the base keeps the look clean without taking up visual space. It doesn’t shout “dining table,” it just fits the way we live now — casual, everyday, and a bit messy most of the time.

I guess I just hadn’t expected a piece of furniture that I thought was mostly functional to end up feeling like a part of the room’s rhythm.
