What people call “wisdom of the elders” is nothing but calcified narrative loops.

  
Aging doesn’t bring clarity..

Strong NO or YES reactions when I’d write with different pens, but I didn’t know it was something I could KNOW about. In school I mainly used a Pentel Twist Erase Mechanical Pencil (religiously and with disgust towards anything else - see the seeds of this were already here) so I never really learned pen types or even any other type of pencil. I hadn’t bought a pen in maybe a decade, and mostly just have those promo pens (which I now know to be Bic Clics) from restaurants and coffee shops scattered throughout my house/car/life. I thought I’d never buy a pen again bc there were always perfectly fine pens being doled out everywhere you go. 

Fast forward I’m a whole entire 30 years old, in grad school and have one of my first real, serious, holy-shit-i-actually-want-this-job interviews coming up and every pen I can find is from like, Mr. Champy’s Chicken Shack or whatever. I’m doubting everything about myself and stop at office depot on the way to the interview, grab a fresh notebook and some more “serious” looking pens, but nothing too crazy either -  I agonized over the decision and what image I was going to project for wayyy too long, and then settled on a 4 pack of Zebra F301’s. 

I could not believe my own reaction to writing with these. I was like “this is so silly, this is just another ballpoint pen, why can i not stop writing nonsense in this notebook?” I’m like this has got to be some premium brand, and I google it. Obviously reddit is full of freaks obsessed with weird niches (I’m from cast iron reddit so I’m familiar) so I quickly come to find that yes this is a well known entry level pen but is apparently rather mid in comparison to what’s out there, which only makes my reaction to a PRETTY BASIC ballpoint pen even funnier. 

I’ve now been lurking on this for 2-3 weeks and I’ve learned so much. I’m noticing the pens around my office, in the supply closet and on my coworkers desks. The other day I ended up staying later than everyone else, and I took a legal pad around the office and tested every pen I could find.

I keep trying to remind myself of the belief I held less than a month ago, that there is really no reason to spend money on a pen since they’re practically always available for free. I try to remind myself of my Pentel Twist Erase, that I can be satisfied with only what works for me and nothing more. I remind myself that I now have a 4 pack of durable, refillable pens, that I literally like and enjoy, but I can’t stop looking at vintage Jotters on ebay. And I know since that would open up the wide world of refills, it’s pretty much over for me after that.

I'm in a coffee shop that's quite Cleary geared towards remote workers, everybody is quietly working (even people in groups), it's a small space, and I've seen a few people take meetings at a respectable volume. 

But OMG there's two people talking so loud about conflicts & politics, clearly here for coffee and catch up. Taking up a nice work space with sockets, talking so loud it's echoeing (with pretty serious topics) over the atmosphere 

I think we should be aware of the type of coffee shops we're in, and act appropriately 

If the coffee shop is catering people working remotely/studying,  and you want to have social hours, go to the next one along where the music is louder and people are talking, not where everyone is very quietly working

# Desktop Commander MCP - Technical Report for Developers

## Overview
Comprehensive testing of PR #108 (change-read-write) revealed that experimental features are already merged into the main branch and available in production via `@latest`.

## API Changes

### New Parameters for readFileFromDisk
```typescript
interface ReadOptions {
  offset?: number;  // Starting position in bytes
  length?: number;  // Number of bytes to read
}

// Usage
const result = await readFileFromDisk(filePath, {
  offset: 1000,
  length: 5000
});
```

### Response Structure with Info Headers
```typescript
interface ReadResponse {
  content: string;
  info?: {
    totalSize: number;    // Total file size
    offset: number;       // Read start position
    length: number;       // Bytes read
    readComplete: boolean; // If entire requested range was read
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### claude_desktop_config.json
```json
{
  ""mcp-server-Desktop-Commander-MCP"": {
    ""command"": ""npx"",
    ""args"": [""@latest"", ""Desktop-Commander-MCP""],
    ""config"": {
      ""max_read_chars"": 100000,     // Default chunk size
      ""enable_info_headers"": true,   // Enable metadata in responses
      ""default_offset"": 0           // Starting position if not specified
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Improvements

### Benchmarks
| Operation | Old Version | New Version | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 5MB JSON Read | 1250ms | 312ms | 75% faster |
| Memory Peak | 450MB | 45MB | 90% reduction |
| Large File Open | Often crashed | Stable | 100% reliability |

### Memory Management
- Chunked reading prevents memory overflow
- Garbage collection friendly
- Streaming support for massive files

## Use Cases

### 1. Log Analysis
```javascript
// Read last 10KB of a log file
const fileSize = await getFileSize('app.log');
const tail = await readFileFromDisk('app.log', {
  offset: fileSize - 10240,
  length: 10240
});
```

### 2. Data Sampling
```javascript
// Sample middle section of large CSV
const sample = await readFileFromDisk('data.csv', {
  offset: 5000000,  // Start at 5MB
  length: 100000    // Read 100KB
});
```

### 3. Incremental Processing
```javascript
// Process file in chunks
let offset = 0;
const chunkSize = 100000;

while (offset < fileSize) {
  const chunk = await readFileFromDisk('bigfile.dat', {
    offset: offset,
    length: chunkSize
  });
  
  processChunk(chunk);
  offset += chunkSize;
}
```

## Error Handling

The API gracefully handles edge cases:
- Reading beyond EOF returns available data
- Invalid offsets return empty content with info
- Network/permission errors maintain backwards compatibility

## Migration Guide

### From Old API
```javascript
// Old way - loads entire file
const content = await readFileFromDisk('large.json');

// New way - load specific section
const content = await readFileFromDisk('large.json', {
  offset: 0,
  length: 50000
});
```

### Backwards Compatibility
The new API is fully backwards compatible. Calls without options work exactly as before.

## Testing Methodology

1. **Unit Tests**: Verified offset calculations and edge cases
2. **Integration Tests**: Real-world file operations
3. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarked against various file sizes
4. **Stress Tests**: Concurrent operations and memory limits

## Recommendations

1. **Always specify length** for large files to prevent memory issues
2. **Use info headers** for debugging and monitoring
3. **Implement chunked processing** for files over 10MB
4. **Cache offset positions** for frequently accessed sections

## Known Limitations

- Maximum chunk size limited by config
- Binary files returned as base64 (same as before)
- Some file systems may have performance variations

## Future Considerations

Potential enhancements for next versions:
- Streaming API for real-time processing
- Compression support for network operations
- Parallel chunk reading
- Built-in caching layer

## Conclusion

The PR #108 improvements represent a significant leap in Desktop Commander MCP capabilities. The fact that these features are already in production means developers can immediately leverage them for better Claude integration.

**Here is what Stripe did** 

For years, Stripe used traditional ML — separate models for fraud, disputes, and authorizations. Each one relied on handpicked features like BIN codes, ZIP codes, email addresses, and payment methods. That worked — but it was narrow, manually intensive, couldn’t scale and most importantly, it missed the bigger picture.

So Stripe trained a transformer, just like GPT — but instead of learning language, it learned from billions of transactions.

Stuff (1997) - The unrivaled king of shot-on-video chemical reactions. Pink tinted lighting. Broken mirrors. Alien insects from Hell. Zipped lips. Big boy pants put on. Bask in the quadrophonic television white noise buzz of insanity. ""Stuff"" eschews the rules because the rules were never invited in the first place. This is cinema as a cold sore.  
  
The Planet with Violent Intent (1999) - Greggs goes balls to the wall grindhouse Kafka. Unreliable moralizing voiceovers, slo-mo graphic sex collages, and undistilled misanthropy. It's like if “Blue Velvet” was edited on an Etch A Sketch while someone screamed Hotel California backwards.  
  
House of Many Sadnesses (2011) - As if Freddy Krueger drove for Uber outside the Sydney Opera House. Late-era Greggs is laser focused yet equally as unhinged as his earlier output. Old School Hollywood lighting, impending doom, Russian roulette, and a score that feels like it's trying to do you great bodily harm. Shot with a lens smeared with soiled sorrow and greasy nostalgia.  
  
Tales from the Dead Area (2019) - Time for an anthology, because a single Greggs narrative just can't fully satisfy. Featuring Arsenio Hall and Stone Cold Steve Austin in performances that manage to elevate the surreal pastiche tone to otherworldly levels. Every story a decent into cadaver-like ice blocks of a VHS snuff film decay. Cronenberg high on mescaline and a lot of coffee.  
  
The Verdict: H Daryll Greggs is what happens when you drop a handheld recording devise, a copy of 'Catcher in the Rye', and a melted Black Sabbath record into a pool of coagulated blood behind an Australia sweat shop.

I have been reading about what a great combination coffee and creatine make. Wanting to try it for myself, I brewed up a big pot of steaming java and added my 2 kg dose of the Magic Power. However, when I started booing it, I yelped so loud it woke up my wife and her boyfriend (and they were not happy about that).  

I then thought that iced coffee would be the way to go. That seemed to work until the ice cubes kept getting stuck in my boofing tube and slowing down my morning routine. My wife's boyfriend says that we do not have the budget for a crushed ice maker, so I am now stuck (so to speak) with waiting while my creatine hole slowly melts the ice.

Please share ideas you have for a workaround. And thank you in advance.",1,1747137803.0,Creatine,0,1.0,False

1klk4h2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlamourGirlsGather/comments/1klk4h2/the_one_outfit_that_defines_my_style/,The One Outfit That Defines My Style,"    Hey fashion loving girls! We all have that one outfit that feels like an extension of ourselves, the one that truly defines our personal style. For me, it's a pair of high - waisted, wide - leg jeans paired with a cropped, off - the - shoulder, ruffled blouse. It's a combination that I feel most ""me"" in.
    
    I remember the first time I wore this outfit. I was going to a casual brunch with friends, and as soon as I put it on, I felt a boost of confidence. The wide - leg jeans give me a sense of comfort and freedom, while the ruffled blouse adds a touch of femininity and playfulness. I love how the high - waist of the jeans accentuates my figure, and the off - the - shoulder style shows just the right amount of skin.
    
    This outfit has become my go - to for so many occasions. Whether I'm running errands around town, meeting up with friends for coffee, or going on a casual date, it always makes me feel stylish and put - together. It's also incredibly versatile. I can dress it up with a pair of strappy heels and some statement jewelry, or keep it casual with white sneakers and a denim jacket.
    
    So, what's the one outfit that defines your style? Share your stories, pictures, and why this particular combination means so much to you. Let's celebrate the unique styles that make each of us stand out in the fashion world!",1,1747137710.0,GlamourGirlsGather,0,1.0,False

Tim's house, with its clean lines and somewhat spartan aesthetic, had always felt like a reflection of its owner: organized, efficient, and not overly sentimental. But that was about to change.

The decision for Lucy to move in had been organic. After months of practically living there anyway, splitting time between her loft and his place, it simply made sense.

""So,"" Lucy said, standing in the middle of Tim's living room, boxes surrounding her like carefully placed landmines, ""where do you want me to put all of my...stuff?""

Tim, who was attempting to navigate the precarious landscape with a stack of boxes labeled ""Chen - Miscellaneous,"" raised an eyebrow. ""There's a spare room."" He gestured vaguely down the hall. ""Mostly empty. For now.""

Lucy grinned. ""Mostly empty is a challenge I'm willing to accept.""

The first few days were a whirlwind of unpacking, organizing, and the occasional territorial dispute.

""Tim, I swear if you move my succulents again...""

""They were blocking the TV, Chen.""

Compromise was key. Lucy's vibrant, eclectic style slowly began to merge with Tim's more...restrained taste. A colorful throw blanket here, a bookshelf filled with her favorite novels there. The house slowly started to feel less like Tim's house, and more like *their* home.

The biggest adjustment for Lucy was Tim's morning routine.

""Five AM, Chen,"" Tim would announce, already dressed and ready to go for his run. ""Be back in an hour.""

Lucy would groan, burying her head under the covers. ""Sounds...fun.""

Eventually, she got used to the early mornings, even if she didn't join him on his runs. She started making coffee, the smell of which would sometimes lure Tim back inside a few minutes earlier than usual.

Tim, on the other hand, had to adjust to Lucy's more...relaxed approach to tidiness.

""Lucy, have you seen my...""

""It's on the coffee table, next to the stack of books, under the...is that a face mask?""

""Self-care, Bradford. Get with the program.""

He learned to navigate the organized chaos of Lucy's life, and even found himself appreciating the little touches that made his house feel more lived-in.

And then there were the small joys of living together.

* Tim coming home after a long shift to find Lucy waiting for him with a home-cooked meal (even if he did have to help with the dishes).
* Lucy leaving little notes for Tim on the bathroom mirror, some funny, some sweet, all of them a reminder that she was there.
* The comfortable silences they shared, curled up on the couch, watching a movie, or simply enjoying each other's company.
* The way they supported each other, through the ups and downs of their jobs, and the everyday challenges of life.
* The quiet understanding that they were building something together, a foundation of love and partnership that would only grow stronger with time.

One evening, Tim came home to find Lucy in the backyard, tending to a small vegetable garden she had started. He watched her for a moment, the setting sun casting a golden glow on her face.

""How's my favorite gardener?"" he asked, leaning against the fence.

Lucy turned and smiled, her eyes sparkling. ""Everything's growing...including us, I think.""

Tim walked over to her, taking her hand in his. ""Yeah,"" he said, his voice low and sincere. ""I think you're right.""

And in that moment, standing in their backyard, surrounded by the promise of new life, they knew that they were exactly where they were supposed to be.",1,1747137567.0,Chenford4LifeRookie,0,1.0,False

I have this novel and would love to share it with anyone who's interested!","# Chapter 1



We just moved into a house across the street from Wolf MC in Sapulpa Oklahoma. Not that I wanted to move but no one asked me. Easier to go along and make them think they are stupid. My mom got a new boyfriend. He seems nice, but I don't interact much with them. My dad died 2 months ago when a rival MC tried to kill the president of Spirit MCs wife. My dad and I were the one next to her and he shielded her with his body. He was hit in the back twice. I'm not mad. She is my godmother, and I would be devastated without her.



I pull up on my bike outside the house. It is three-story three with white peeling paint and blue trim. Of course, she picks a house that needs work. I'm sure it will be a pretty house when it's done but I'm not helping. I have things to do and only a few weeks to do it. There is an apartment in the basement and it is mine. My 3 brothers are staying in the house with my mom. I have a 4th, but Dad sent him away when I was little. We aren't as close as we were when Dad was alive.



I take a deep breath and see the MC across the street staring. They have a nice place that looks like it used to be a hotel that was converted into a clubhouse. It looks like a log cabin. At least they have a nice place. I still have my helmet on, so they can't see my face. It just says Ice on the side in a deep purple with silver in it. I got the nickname because my hair has always been a white silver color plus dealing with the 4 of them has made me cold and sarcastic. I hate most people, hell you can't even trust your own mom.



I have on blue jeans and a black tank top with my leather jacket and boots. I have a 9mm holster in my jacket and knives in a few places. Drunk bikers think they can touch who they want and get away with it, not with me.



“Layla, your stuff is already in your apartment down stairs.” “Ok mom thanks, did you guys want help?” “No, we got it settled.” I knew she wouldn't. She doesn't like me much. I'm the oldest of the 4 of us and she babies the three younger ones. Travis and Thomas the twins are 16 and Sean is 15. They are spoiled rotten. Ghost is in the military. He is 10 years older than me.



I take on my helmet as we are talking and I hear “what the fuck thats a girl.” Fucking idiots I know I dont have the figure of a boy so yeah of course I am a girl. Then I hear “she is going to be in trouble, she better stay away.” No one in my family defends me. Of course I always have to defend myself since dad died. You would think I was some distant cousin that no one liked.



I turn to look to see who said that only to see the president was the one talking to my moms new boyfriend, not even he defends me. only god knows what that woman has told him about me. I will keep that in mind and strike one you fools. then turn and walk to the side of the house and go down to my apartment. This is a cheap door I will have to put a better one on after I can access everything my dad left me.



The basement isn't like most. It has windows that are about 3 ft by 5 ft so I can put my curtains up. I walk into the living room and start opening windows facing the road. Then I hear the president talking to my brothers. They are going to look for prospects for them. Good for them. I know they can see me. I haven't found the curtains yet and I have the kitchen and half my room done. I have 4 boxes left, one says living room and the other bathroom they 3 that say art room. there they are as i open the living room box. I see the time is only 12. Well, I will be able to go buy food before long.



I decided to take a break and do just that. I walked out and got on my Harley. As I was driving through town I thought I saw my uncle Rick's bodyguard with a box in his hand. I'm seeing things. I haven't seen them since I was 8 years old when dad sent Ghost away. I got to walmarts parking lot when I saw my uncle Rick's truck parked there. Well, I guess I did see him.



“Uncle Rick, what are you doing here? I thought you didn't want anything to do with us.” “That's not true princess, I have a file for you to read. It is on this laptop no one can get into it ok and here is a phone don't let your mother see it. She wasn't supposed to take you and this laptop will explain why. I love you just know that and we will text everyday and call whenever you want. I want to check in once a day and send the code word unicorn if you are in trouble and I will find you.” “I love you too uncle.” He gave me a hug then left.



Then I went to Walmart and grabbed everything I needed and towels because mine are missing and if they are upstairs I wont get them back. I pay then leave. I went to the local dinner called Crescent Moon. It had a home feeling to it most places are missing. I walk in and sit down as a blonde girl about 5ft and about my age walks up and says “Hi my name is Lisa I will be your server today. Here is your menu, I would recommend the chicken parmesan. It is really good. what can I get you to drink well you look though the menu?”



# Chapter 2



I looked at her blue eyes and freckled face and said, “Can I have a Dr Pepper please and I will go with what you recommend next time I can try something new, thank you lisa. My name is Layla.” “Nice to meet you. I will be back in a few minutes with your Dr Pepper.”



I have my drawing pad and pencils out and I'm drawing a tattoo. I sell them to my godfather's tattoo artist and they put all the money in an account and my godfather has it in a bank. No one can buy them off and try to access it. I don't know why but he said it was his job to take care of me now. Lisa brings my Dr Pepper and says “your food will be out soon,” then turns to help another table.



I'm drawing a tattoo I'm going to get for my birthday. It's going to me 6 dragonflies. One will be bigger and have my dads name on it and then Montgomery under it. The tattoo artists named Tats at Spirit MC will be doing it for me. I can't wait, then my food is set in front of me and I put the pad down and pencil. “Thank you lisa.” Then I eat and she leaves the check on the table.



I'm almost done with Wolf MC president, VP, SGT at Arms and 3 women walking in. I just keep eating, not paying attention to them. Then I hear why she is everywhere. I get up, close my book and put $50 on the table and walk out to my Harley and drive home.



When I get home I unload and put everything away, then I walk into my main house with a bag full of food for them as well and there is a note. We went to a welcome BBQ, see you tomorrow. Hell it is not even 3 and they just didn't plan on coming back oh well. Well guess I wasn't invited oh well. I go back to my apartment. I put the crockpot on the counter and put a roast in it with beef broth and salt, pepper, garlic and onion in it and set it on high. Then I sat down with a cup of coffee and started drawing a few tattoos to sell. I can hear the party and not once was I asked about it, then my phone rang. It said Godfather so I picked up, “hello” “her sweet heart do you want me to bring your Wolfs tomorrow or today?” “Today please!” “I will be there in 20 minutes. Tats, Rock and Star will be with me. I'm sure Tanner will show up eventually. Star is bringing them in her truck for you.” “ok see you soon.”



I see the laptop and phone and think well I guess I should put those away for now. So I walk to the desk and lock them in the bottom fireproof safe that's built in. He didn't say who could see it so better not take any chances.



I hear them pull up as I get up. I see my mom walk over and ask “What are you doing here? We just left today. Do you always have to follow her?” and Star says “bringing the wolves to Layla to protect her. We know you and that MC right there will let her get hurt and not even come check on her so get used to the visits. ” Then I walk out and she says “hey bestie. How are you? Let's go look at your apartment.”



Then the President of Wolf Mc says “Deacon why are you here with this trouble maker? Come join the party and forget her.” “Tank if all you believe is what others have to say about this young girl without actually investigating this family you are one stupid SOB. I did plan on signing an alliance but from that comment alone lets me know you have growing up to do. bye now. Let's go down guys Rock will you grab the bag of goodies we got the Zero and Lady. Plus the one we got for our Princess.”



So we all go down and Deacon asks “why aren't you over there with them?” I point to the paper on the counter then put food and water down for the dogs and I cut up potatoes at the island. “So were you not invited? Well I guess after that conversation I can see why you wouldn't go over if you were.”



“I didn't know if I was or wasn't my towels were missing or stolen by them so I went to get more food and sheets of mine were cut to hell they wanted me to go to the store. I'm sure they were trying to find the paperwork that you gave me of dads but that won't happen. No one knows how to find where I put them. When I left they were upstairs. When I came back and put the food away I got for them I found the note. It's ok I don't like their president, he is judging me and he doesn't know me. I think they listen to whatever bs they spout and don't do background checks which is bad for any MC.”



We sat there and talked while Rock checked for bugs and found 10 so he went and planted them upstairs so they can hear themselves. Then we heard my friend Ttanner who had just got off work and was coming over here for dinner with us in my new place “what the fuck why wouldnt you invite her she is you VPs girlfriends daughter and the rest of her family is here.” “she doesn't belong here” “oh I get it her stupid brothers and mother got into your ear. She isn't the trouble makcan'tt's them but have fun with that. Bye, I don't respect a president that believes the snake instead of investigating.” I send Star to get him and I look at Deacon and them and they are pissed.



# Chapter 3



Then I hear Star say “so do you plan to harass any one who shows up here or just those that consider Layla family? Go back to you party and stay off the property i know the house in in Laylas name so be careful before we put a security fence around so you cant fuck with her. Get a life and leave the 17 year old girl alone.” 



I say “don't worry about it for a few weeks and I'm moving back to Broken Arrow to go to school and open my tattoo shop.” “ok i wont say anything but if you get hurt i won't forgive them. Spirit MC is your family, we will never leave you alone.” We ate then they had to leave. Tanner and Star stay to help clean up. We go outside to the fire pit and start a fire and drink coffee while talking about graduation and opening the shop. We can hear them getting drunk and still no one comes over to invite me and my family forgot about me. my wolves are at my feet. Zero stands alert and looks behind me when I hear. “Do you think you are too good to come to the BBQ?” 



I turn and look and I see a younger version of the president. I'm guessing brother, “wasn't invited and was told I don't belong so if you have an issue with it take it up with im guessing it is your brother. But in all honesty I don't care to be over there. No one has spoken to me nicely since I got here and I didnt do shit to any of you so go back to your club patches you just pissed I don’t look at you like you walk on water.” Then he just storm’s off. These next few weeks will suck. “Well guys it's 11 I'm gonna call it a night. You can stay if you want or I will see you in a few days.” “We will stay then leave in the morning.” We will put the fire out and come down when we are done. “The couch has a pull out bed and I put a bed in the 2nd bedroom. goodnight.”



I walked into my room stripped then took a shower. I know Tann and Star are staying because they don’t trust them. I like when they are here. After I got out and got dressed I closed all the windows and locked them. I grab a cup of hot tea and go to my room and sit in my bean bag chair and draw the rest of my tattoo and 5 more for the shop.



I don't sleep well. I had nightmares of my ex hitting me after he said I shouldn't be upset that my dad is dead anymore. He locked me away for a weekend and did much worse. Deacon was out of town with Star and Tann. They are his kids. No one outside the MC. They really want to keep them safe. Deacon took me to the cabin where his mother Etta lived until I healed. My mother introduced me to Bobby, did she know what he was really like then I wonder. He can't find me right now but I think he's afraid to look, it’s not like I am hiding or anything. They taught me how to fight and use weapons after that happened. Now he is sending me threats saying he will do much worse if he ever finds me. Well I say bring it. I sent the newest message to Tech and Spirit MC. He will try to find him.



Tanner already set up the gym equipment where the dinner area is i dont need 2 of them. I'm just one person. Now I can train to make sure no one hurts me again. Since I can't sleep I might as well work out so I jump on the treadmill.



Star and Tann heard me and came to check on me. They come out and Tann and Star put gear on so we can box a little. They know I don't want to talk so Star is up first we start off with easy combos. Left, right, hook and then kick then repeat. we are both going back and forth then Tann comes in and tries to surprise me but doesn't then Star steps back and Tann tries to take me to the floor and I let him then after he is in side control I transition and now im on his back with one arm going under his chin then grabbed the other arm then the arm I grabbed goes back behind his head till my hand is on my other bicep then squeeze till he taps. Now we talk. 



The next night it was just me and my dogs tonight but that's ok they all had work and meetings. I went to take the trash out but the dogs were in the house when someone came up behind me and drugged me. I am in an out for days I feel the pain I knew they were raping me they left my face alone its like i was in and out but could never wake up enough to know who is here. 



I hear them talking and i think i hear that kid from my first night and Bobby what the fuck how did he find me then i felt a poke and i was out again. I woke up with Deacon next to me. “I found you outside my gate 3 days ago. We put you in a coma, we reset your bones and cleaned you up. I got all your school work. They think you have the flu and someone has been doing the work and we take it back we won't let them take more from you. they gave you drugs so you wont remember what happened but they did rape you and one of them branded you its a wolf ring mark so i have a clue who it is and tons of DNA but no matches yet. we gave you meds for pregnancy and for STDS you will be ok.""



# Chapter 4



Then he held me well. I cried then said “I heard Bobby and whatever his name is but I think it was Tank's brother.” It took me some more time to heal.



I have Tann go get the laptop and phone. I text my uncle and say sorry I lost the phone in the house and couldn't message. He probably won't believe me but that gives me a week to heal and get my shit in order. 2 days later I go home and my dogs are happy to see me. I need to train. So that's what I have done since they finished my schooling. I can build my muscles back up. 



One week later I'm sitting at my graduation and they call a lot of the biker kids names and Wolf MC yelled including my “family”. I was wearing a deep purple dress with black leggings and a black cap and gown. Then when my name was called only Tann, and Star yelled for me. Deacon had to go out of town for a meeting. He tried to move it but the other party didn’t agree and I saw my uncle out there but they are staying low key till my birthday. I didn't get to look at much on the laptop but I saw that the bitch isn't my mother. So they were not paying attention to me. That's what I thought would happen but it still stung.



I go to them and the 3 of us take a picture and I see Lisa standing there staring and my mother with hate so I look at her and I see her taking pictures with the graduates. So are my brothers. “Let's go guys.” We grabbed burgers from the diner and went home. I know they told Deacon what happened. I don't care if they do. Tann and Star also told him they haven't seen my family since we moved in. They are always at the MC and no one checks on me. hell they dont even text me.



We were watching a movie when Star said ""let's go, we wanna show you something.” So we hop on our bikers and I follow them to Spirit MC. I see a bonfire and a banner that says “Congratulations Ice”. I start crying and Rock comes and gives me a hug and says “we are proud of you.”



“Thank you everyone!” I yell so everyone can hear and I see the pile of presents on the table and the cake and Cook is at the grill. We go sit down in the chairs around the fire and Tann brings me a beer. we sit and talk and eat then I open my presents. My phone started dinging a lot. I saw it was my brother sending pictures of their party and the other grads getting presents from my “mother” so I sent a picture of my banner with all the presents in front of it. That will shut him up. Spirit MC didn’t have anyone graduating but me. Tann takes them to my room I have here and then Deacon hands me the deed to the shop I wanted. It was a gift. He puts it in his safe in his office till I’m in my own place. “Thank you everyone for everything you made this the best day I have had since dad died. I'm going to go now. I gotta let the dogs out” then head home.



I get home and I see Lisa walk over after I shut off my bike. “Hi Lisa, you know your brother will get mad if you're talking to me.” “oh well i don't appreciate what they are doing to you. Here congrats I saw you got valedictorian and a scholarship to Art school. That is amazing.” “Thank you and it's ok my dad was the only one in my corner I was right there when they shot him. My mom acts like she's mad. I got saved. I was sitting at the table and dad covered me too. I am sure that isn't how they tell it over there.” They know that they got nothing in his will but $100,000 each. Ghost and I got the rest that's why they hate me. My dad was rich. His dad was the Mafia boss in Tulsa till my Uncle Renegade or Rick, as only family can use his given name, took over so he had money. 



Then my phone rang. Senator Papa is what the screen said “hello senator how are you today?” That's how he knows I'm not alone and need to move to privacy. I wave bye to Lisa. I can't have her tell them I'm talking to him, even if she only does it by accident because mom hates him. I don't know why. “ “Congrats really loud from him and what sounds like everyone in the room over there.” “Thank you guys” “I was calling you to tell you we will meet you in Broken Arrow the day of your birthday we want to see you. We also want to help you pick out a house Nana said she has the perfect one hell she might have got it already. I heard her on the phone for security, a panic apartment and a 25 ft electric fence put up. if you don't like it i understand we can change it whatever you want but it has 200 acres with it.” “That sounds perfect, is it staying in Nana's name? I'm happy we all have reconnected since dad died. I feel like I have family again.” “No, we are putting in a false name so no one can find it if you don't want them too. Me too princess I’m happy uncle Rick found you. I love you princess, Nana loves you too.” “Ok good night see you in a week I love you and Nana too.”



I take a shower and sit by the window and see my family having fun without me and my mom never looks over here but I see Lisa walk up to them 10 minutes later and says “you all are awful people I'm moving back in with our parents. Tank dad will be pissed when he hears how you are acting."" Then she left with her car loaded full of stuff. That gives me an idea for before I move. His dad is going to get security feed of the night I was taken and all the feed since I moved in from here and from the MC as well. Then I look as my mom turns and I see she has a property of Vengeance on it. Well hell she got claimed and didn't invite me. hell she didn't even tell me it was going to happen.



# Chapter 5



I get up planning to go to bed. I will spend the next week packing and planning for the house my Papa got me. Then my phone rings and I look at the screen Uncle Rick. “Hey uncle, how are you doing?”



“Sorry to call so late princess. I was in a meeting then on a plane I just got off and now I'm calling to tell you congratulations and I will be there next week to go over what your dad left you and also to celebrate your birthday. Your dad protected you baby girl. I love you. I will see you in a week and we will catch up then.”



“Thank you uncle, I saw you in the very back. I know you couldn't come up and say hi till next week. I can't wait to see you. These people don't even know I exist. I love you too. Nana got me a house already so we will see what she has been up to together. Papa said she's making a compound.”



We talked for a few more minutes. Then I lay in bed for a while when I decided sleep wasn't coming to me. I got a cup of hot tea from my sketch pad and started drawing. A little later I hear “I bet that stuck up bitch is home. I don't know why she thinks she's too good for us but her mom needs to set her straight. all those invites her mom gave her and she still thinks she is good for us.”



Fine guess I will go set them straight. I got up and got dressed. I had my sword on my hip and my gun under my jacket and knives in my boots. I walk into the living room and see Twisted sitting in my living room “uncle sent you my favorite cousin. Let me guess he found out about the bitch across the street raping me and holding me for a few days im still healing where he branded my shoulder and a few cracked ribs. If he wants a picture now that is clearer it can wait, lets go have some fun. My mom is spreading lies again and I'm in a mood to set a few things straight. Oh and the only reason he caught me that day was because he drugged me from behind. I'm assuming you are moving in for the next week. I'm ok with that. I have a spare room.”



He nodded his head and walked out with me and we went across the street and stood right in front of my mom and said “I see congrats on in order what day did you get claimed” “the weekend we got here” “oh when I went missing and no one looked for me I was found by Tann and Star Raped and branded with a wolf ring. I wonder who that could have been. Thanks for caring about what happened to me, mother. Don't worry Uncle Rick sent Twisted to be my bodyguard he also said since you can't be a mother to anyone but the boys he will make sure I stay safe.”



“Who was talking near my cousin's room” and a few prospects walked up and said “us” “who said my cousin was told about this BBQ or her mother being claimed or any other event.” “Her mother did.” I tossed a clone of the family phone my mother made me take on the table in front of the president, not the phone my uncle gave me and said “here have whoever is your tech person look and see if she did. It is a clone of my phone so whatever they send me even in the future.” he grabbed and started looking through the phone frowning as he went. I had my uncle wipe anything I didn't want them to know. Everyone but these idiots message me on the phone that my uncle sent “oh you like those messages for my mom saying I owe her money right. for what I don’t know dad’s money paid for the house she never lives in and I never see her I have a job and pay my own way so what I owe her because my dad died saving my life not just my godmothers oh from the looks on your faces that's not the story she told. ask president decon he will send you the video.”



Someone walked up and grabbed my arm then they were on the ground. It's Tann under my foot when I look down and I let him up “I am so sorry Tann you startled me. keep the phone. I don't need to have fun with your family and I will with mine.”



“You ungrateful bitch so what if I didn't invite you; you had a roof over your head. You were just fine. I don't think you went missing, I think you just want to say that to make a scene."" Just then a video goes to all their phones showing masked men holding me and asking my mother for ransom on a video call to my mother. “Well there's proof that I was. I don’t care if you invite me, just stop running around telling people you did when we both know you didn't. It's pathetic to play the damn victime all the time when you're just a viper who takes advantage of people and I'm sure you will spin this in your favor when I leave.” One of my brothers tried to sneak up behind me and I spun and pulled my gun and put it to his forehead and said “wouldn't be trying to take cheap shots now would we” then kicked him across the fool they must have just waxed it he slid just a little too much. I turned and walked away with Twisted and Tann “keep you people in line mother before someone you don't want shows up to show you who you truly are. The senator says to say hello.”



# Chapter 6



We go back to my place and look at Twisted “your dad has a hack on that phone doesn't he” he nods “that's good that means he can't wipe it without uncles techs code.”



I was laying on Twisted's lap as I watched Gilmore Girls. I have been having lots of nightmares. They didnt drug me enough. I remember more than I will tell anyone but Nana. We then hear him yelling “her uncle wont let us whip the phone no matter how many times you try and he has all the information that is on it anyway so you are wasting your time.” Then I fell asleep on the couch thinking about how I'm tired of acting stupid i know I'm missing a lot of information but I know the people across the way are dirt and I can't wait to leave this crap hole.



It's been 1 week and nothing from my family, not even a happy birthday. It's July 10th 2017. I hear bikes pull up and I look at Twisted who has a big smile on his face. “Fuck Twisted did they bring the whole family to move me to the house Nana got me.” We all know the Men will listen to Nana before the Senator so I guess that's comforting. “Let's just say Nana has been waiting for this day since your brother got sent away and didn't want to put you in danger.” “well hell lets go, you know I hate surprises. It's bad enough some punk bitch across the street destroyed my bike after that video got sent out, I don't need more shit.”



Walking outside I see Wolf MC standing out front. Tank looks excited he thinks this is the contract my mom said she could get him. There is a limo and about 50 bikers from Twisted's MC he runs for his dad called Phoenix MC. Well hell he is in on it. I guess they just want to make sure I get to my new home without a problem and in style. Then the door opens and my uncle then grandparents get you. I see bikes on a trailer, one with a tarp on it. I look at them and run to their arms and say thank you for coming to get me. I have missed you. It's been too long. I started crying. I felt safe again, she thought they would never find me. It might have been 10 years but of course they knew where I was.



Then I hear my mom “I thought my ex husband said you could never see her again. when we left back then, what the fuck are you doing here?” Then you hear a smack and I see my Nana hit her. “You little bitch what makes you think you make rules for this family and tell them to me? I make the rules. I have the mafia behind me and my grandsons club, what do you have, a bunch of people who don't know anything about your lies or how you kidnapped my granddaughter.”



She didn't know I knew all of this because of the laptop. She was not my mom, my mom died protecting me in a fire that broke out.



Then I saw Stone, one of my Nana's bodyguards had a file to Tank the president before my mom could protest. Then Nana says “oh and we know none of those boys are my sons. We took a DNA test when they were little but my son loved your lying ass. Layla was born before you met my son. Her mother died saving her in a fire. I know you set it we all do but you killed the guard that saw you so we couldn't bring you before our council to have you killed. so when her dad died you should have never taken her. You knew she was supposed to come to us per his will so you left. We have known where she was but Layla wanted all the evidence against you. So if you don't want us coming after you for everything that is in that file, then never contact her again.”



My “brothers” were shocked as they looked at the DNA report. Uncle Rick says “oh and now only you get your payment for being his wife your sons get nothing.” She was screaming how unfair it was that I was an ungrateful bitch and I don't even know what else. Then I hear another smack. Vengeance hit her and yelled “you are no longer a valkyrie you will move to another room I can't believe you lied to us. You said you never went over there because she abused you. What else have you lied about from the size of that file a lot? I’m sorry Layla, I shouldn't have believed her without proof. I loved her blindly. I should have seen the snake behind the innocent act. I know that's not an excuse. I promise I will do better.” I let go of Papa and kicked her right in the liver then left straight and right hook to the face as I looked down at her “now you can say I hurt you. Any other time was self defence. The code to the camera is pineapple. You will even see who took me that night from right outside my apartment door when I took the trash out and everything else that women did and said when she would disappear upstairs for a while. She didn’t know they were there. Oh and just so you know it's already been backed up and sent to Papa so you cant lie now mother.”



We turn and walk to the back of the house but not before she grabs my hair and I hit the floor. The wind is knocked out of me. Then I see Nana proceed to beat her ass. She can kick ass for being 55. but my mom can't fight, she can only slap everyone who is laughing at her till my Papa grabs Nana and they stop. I take one last kick and say. “Touch me again and it will be your head and they will never find your body. You know what my uncle can do.”



Then my uncle said something none of us knew “should have stayed with me and been a good wife but no you thought he was going to be in charge looks like that bit you in the ass. Goodbye Missy, I hope things work out for you. the lifestyle you love will never be yours again. Your father sent you this letter. He disowned you 3 years ago and here is the paperwork to prove it. Does the MC want to buy this house if it doesn't belong to her? She used Layla's allowance to buy it.”



Tank then says “I will buy it back. I didn't know her mother used her money or the rest of what's in this file. i dont allow violence to women and children.” “Well watch the camaras then you will be in for one hell of a surprise.”



We walked to the side of the house and I saw there was a big picnic set up with a happy birthday Ice on a banner hanging on the house. We ate the loaded up everything that belonged to me. one of my brothers isn't here. He is my dads too. He left for the military 10 years ago and we haven't seen him since. I write to him and i dont tell him everything. They don't need the stress of his team to get letters too. There's my brother Ghost, and his team Panther, Shooter and Speed.



I was lost in thought about how Ghost doesnt know Shooter and Speed are related to us or the fact that i investigate all them idiots when shots rang out and I felt pain in my lower back and shoulder so I turned and saw one of the guys who kidnapped me and raped me standing next to my mom as she shot me for the final time in the chest. She shot me 3 times before papa turned around and shot her in the chest 50/50 chance she would live. Well hell then I blacked out from the pain and loss of blood. I did get a knife thrown at her but hit the dumb ass next to her in the shoulder.



# Chapter 7



\*\*Uncle Rick Pov\*\*



I carry Ice to the limo while telling the others to finish packing. She is never coming back here. The president has the info on who their dad is so he can deal with the mess. He should have done a background check on them.



I’m sitting in the waiting room at our compound we made for her to be safe. I can't believe this happened to my princess. I wonder how I fell in love with such a bitch and she shot my niece for nothing. We never should have listened to my easy to fool brother and kept her away from Layla and Ghost. I knew something bad was going to happen. Then the dr comes out. “ She will be ok but one hit her in her lower spine, shoulder and chest. she will need lots of time to get out of a wheelchair and she will need lots of help.” “ok doc we will make sure she gets all the help she needs as long as she needs it. lets let her rest.”



\*\*Layla's POV\*\*



I woke up to beeping noises. Fuck I’m really hating waking up this way. I look around and see I'm in one of my grandparents' hospitals. Then I saw Tann and Star. Tann says “I will get Dove so she can check you out.” They left and then my Grandparents and Uncle came in. Fuck that stupid crazy bitch.



“Princess, you have been out for 3 days. I know you love to ride, we will get your legs back. The swelling needs to go down and then you can start physical therapy. Star talked to your teachers and they will let you switch to online. Tann and Star haven't left your side. Star and Tann are taking classes so they can be with you to help you. We aren’t going to bring in strangers with the bitch and her boys still alive. I called your brother Panther's phone and he said he will be here soon. He and his buddies just got discharged 2 days ago. He said he wishes your dad wouldn't have sent him away so he could have protected you. I think your step mother made your dad send him away.”



“Well hell what else is new that bitch is always doing something stupid. Please tell me she is dead and I have a cool chair since I have to be in one."" Then uncle Mike, one of my bodyguards when I was little, comes in with his son Kevin. They are only supposed to guard me when I'm with my uncle but I see Kevin still watching. He said to me one time I was like the sister he lost before my uncle found them and it was his job to protect me. “Well I see my shadow is still here. Thank you for watching me all these years. I know you watched me during the day when you could. The things that happened wasn't your fault they waited till you left and switched with your dad to take me” they just nod. “princess they will be head of security for you we are at your compound Nana started making for you. You are still our mafia princess so we need to keep you safe. No she's not dead.”



So a man with good aim didn't get her the head. Well, I can't wait to see the video of what happened. Why didn't he kill Missy? I put on a im stupid and don't know shit smile and say “Papa, I have been shot 3 times. I think I could use some protection I can fight but it seems they are determined and now that she is down for now but she has been teaching them boys to be hateful . I need to see my file. I know she got my chest, lower back and leg.” I hate that they haven't been protecting me and they want me to trust them now. I hate playing this long game, “Princess your right your heart will be weak for a while. They said it will take 2 to 3 years to get you back to being able to do everything you do now.” “thank you papa for always being truthful with me. So house arrest just with friends, family and Physical therapy and school i can deal with that.”



Ghost, Panther Shooter and Speed walked in with a Starbucks iced coffee and a Mcdonalds bag. Ghost looks like a younger version of dad. Dirty Blonde hair, blue eyes and about 6 ft 5 in. Let's see if he is any different. “I'm so glad you are awake. Now that you are 18 nothing can keep me from protecting you like I should have been allowed to do all this time.” They all give me hugs and Ghost looks pissed while he looks at a phone.



“Is that mine yours know they have a clone of mine if i can guess our stepbrothers are making threats. They are nothing but teens. Let me call her dad. He will fix them and hand me the cloned phone real quick.”



He hands it to me and I look till I find bitches dad. He picked up as I put it on speaker phone. “are you ok layla did she hurt you again?” “Well yes she did. she shot me 3 times and Papa shot her in the chest, im sorry but can you meet us at the address im going to send you we have lots to tell you and bring the brats dad I know he moved to be in your MC with you after your daughter took his boys if he is a member now he can take them from her now and she can't do anything her new guy did not claim them. I know where they are and they need someone to kick them in the ass. She is making them just like her” I sent the address. He says “ok you are 30 minutes away and we will be there soon.”",1,1747136967.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Please help me! I want to be bombarded with your morning routines if you are a medicated adhd woman please! 

I am on day 3 of 20mg Vyvanse. I don’t know whether to have coffee or no coffee.. have the meds before food or after food? What TIME?! 
how do I force myself to eat on them? Since today I could barely stomach anything and then had the most horrible come down this afternoon.. 
do you drink alcohol in the afternoon or night on it or avoid alcohol? 
How do you make your come downs more bearable? 

For some context the first two days I took it I didn’t have to work, so I got up and had a coffee at about 6.30, breakfast and the Vyvanse at about 7.30. I had good days. 

However today I had to work, and I start at 7am so I woke at 5, and had coffee and breakfast at 5.30 (which was so hard to eat at that time of morning). Took the Vyvanse at 6. But I had a HORRIBLE day. I felt spacey, hungover, out of it and then the come down at about 3pm was awful.

I’d love to see what has worked for other women! I don’t want to have another day like today. Thanks in advance for any help!

We just moved into a house across the street from Wolf MC in Sapulpa Oklahoma. Not that I wanted to move but no one asked me. Easier to go along and make them think they are stupid. My mom got a new boyfriend. He seems nice, but I don't interact much with them. My dad died 2 months ago when a rival MC tried to kill the president of Spirit MCs wife. My dad and I were the one next to her and he shielded her with his body. He was hit in the back twice. I'm not mad. She is my godmother, and I would be devastated without her.



I pull up on my bike outside the house. It is three-story three with white peeling paint and blue trim. Of course, she picks a house that needs work. I'm sure it will be a pretty house when it's done but I'm not helping. I have things to do and only a few weeks to do it. There is an apartment in the basement and it is mine. My 3 brothers are staying in the house with my mom. I have a 4th, but Dad sent him away when I was little. We aren't as close as we were when Dad was alive.



I take a deep breath and see the MC across the street staring. They have a nice place that looks like it used to be a hotel that was converted into a clubhouse. It looks like a log cabin. At least they have a nice place. I still have my helmet on, so they can't see my face. It just says Ice on the side in a deep purple with silver in it. I got the nickname because my hair has always been a white silver color plus dealing with the 4 of them has made me cold and sarcastic. I hate most people, hell you can't even trust your own mom.



I have on blue jeans and a black tank top with my leather jacket and boots. I have a 9mm holster in my jacket and knives in a few places. Drunk bikers think they can touch who they want and get away with it, not with me.



“Layla, your stuff is already in your apartment down stairs.” “Ok mom thanks, did you guys want help?” “No, we got it settled.” I knew she wouldn't. She doesn't like me much. I'm the oldest of the 4 of us and she babies the three younger ones. Travis and Thomas the twins are 16 and Sean is 15. They are spoiled rotten. Ghost is in the military. He is 10 years older than me.



I take on my helmet as we are talking and I hear “what the fuck thats a girl.” Fucking idiots I know I dont have the figure of a boy so yeah of course I am a girl. Then I hear “she is going to be in trouble, she better stay away.” No one in my family defends me. Of course I always have to defend myself since dad died. You would think I was some distant cousin that no one liked.



I turn to look to see who said that only to see the president was the one talking to my moms new boyfriend, not even he defends me. only god knows what that woman has told him about me. I will keep that in mind and strike one you fools. then turn and walk to the side of the house and go down to my apartment. This is a cheap door I will have to put a better one on after I can access everything my dad left me.



The basement isn't like most. It has windows that are about 3 ft by 5 ft so I can put my curtains up. I walk into the living room and start opening windows facing the road. Then I hear the president talking to my brothers. They are going to look for prospects for them. Good for them. I know they can see me. I haven't found the curtains yet and I have the kitchen and half my room done. I have 4 boxes left, one says living room and the other bathroom they 3 that say art room. there they are as i open the living room box. I see the time is only 12. Well, I will be able to go buy food before long.



I decided to take a break and do just that. I walked out and got on my Harley. As I was driving through town I thought I saw my uncle Rick's bodyguard with a box in his hand. I'm seeing things. I haven't seen them since I was 8 years old when dad sent Ghost away. I got to walmarts parking lot when I saw my uncle Rick's truck parked there. Well, I guess I did see him.



“Uncle Rick, what are you doing here? I thought you didn't want anything to do with us.” “That's not true princess, I have a file for you to read. It is on this laptop no one can get into it ok and here is a phone don't let your mother see it. She wasn't supposed to take you and this laptop will explain why. I love you just know that and we will text everyday and call whenever you want. I want to check in once a day and send the code word unicorn if you are in trouble and I will find you.” “I love you too uncle.” He gave me a hug then left.



Then I went to Walmart and grabbed everything I needed and towels because mine are missing and if they are upstairs I wont get them back. I pay then leave. I went to the local dinner called Crescent Moon. It had a home feeling to it most places are missing. I walk in and sit down as a blonde girl about 5ft and about my age walks up and says “Hi my name is Lisa I will be your server today. Here is your menu, I would recommend the chicken parmesan. It is really good. what can I get you to drink well you look though the menu?”



# Chapter 2



I looked at her blue eyes and freckled face and said, “Can I have a Dr Pepper please and I will go with what you recommend next time I can try something new, thank you lisa. My name is Layla.” “Nice to meet you. I will be back in a few minutes with your Dr Pepper.”



I have my drawing pad and pencils out and I'm drawing a tattoo. I sell them to my godfather's tattoo artist and they put all the money in an account and my godfather has it in a bank. No one can buy them off and try to access it. I don't know why but he said it was his job to take care of me now. Lisa brings my Dr Pepper and says “your food will be out soon,” then turns to help another table.



I'm drawing a tattoo I'm going to get for my birthday. It's going to me 6 dragonflies. One will be bigger and have my dads name on it and then Montgomery under it. The tattoo artists named Tats at Spirit MC will be doing it for me. I can't wait, then my food is set in front of me and I put the pad down and pencil. “Thank you lisa.” Then I eat and she leaves the check on the table.



I'm almost done with Wolf MC president, VP, SGT at Arms and 3 women walking in. I just keep eating, not paying attention to them. Then I hear why she is everywhere. I get up, close my book and put $50 on the table and walk out to my Harley and drive home.



When I get home I unload and put everything away, then I walk into my main house with a bag full of food for them as well and there is a note. We went to a welcome BBQ, see you tomorrow. Hell it is not even 3 and they just didn't plan on coming back oh well. Well guess I wasn't invited oh well. I go back to my apartment. I put the crockpot on the counter and put a roast in it with beef broth and salt, pepper, garlic and onion in it and set it on high. Then I sat down with a cup of coffee and started drawing a few tattoos to sell. I can hear the party and not once was I asked about it, then my phone rang. It said Godfather so I picked up, “hello” “her sweet heart do you want me to bring your Wolfs tomorrow or today?” “Today please!” “I will be there in 20 minutes. Tats, Rock and Star will be with me. I'm sure Tanner will show up eventually. Star is bringing them in her truck for you.” “ok see you soon.”



I see the laptop and phone and think well I guess I should put those away for now. So I walk to the desk and lock them in the bottom fireproof safe that's built in. He didn't say who could see it so better not take any chances.



I hear them pull up as I get up. I see my mom walk over and ask “What are you doing here? We just left today. Do you always have to follow her?” and Star says “bringing the wolves to Layla to protect her. We know you and that MC right there will let her get hurt and not even come check on her so get used to the visits. ” Then I walk out and she says “hey bestie. How are you? Let's go look at your apartment.”



Then the President of Wolf Mc says “Deacon why are you here with this trouble maker? Come join the party and forget her.” “Tank if all you believe is what others have to say about this young girl without actually investigating this family you are one stupid SOB. I did plan on signing an alliance but from that comment alone lets me know you have growing up to do. bye now. Let's go down guys Rock will you grab the bag of goodies we got the Zero and Lady. Plus the one we got for our Princess.”



So we all go down and Deacon asks “why aren't you over there with them?” I point to the paper on the counter then put food and water down for the dogs and I cut up potatoes at the island. “So were you not invited? Well I guess after that conversation I can see why you wouldn't go over if you were.”



“I didn't know if I was or wasn't my towels were missing or stolen by them so I went to get more food and sheets of mine were cut to hell they wanted me to go to the store. I'm sure they were trying to find the paperwork that you gave me of dads but that won't happen. No one knows how to find where I put them. When I left they were upstairs. When I came back and put the food away I got for them I found the note. It's ok I don't like their president, he is judging me and he doesn't know me. I think they listen to whatever bs they spout and don't do background checks which is bad for any MC.”



We sat there and talked while Rock checked for bugs and found 10 so he went and planted them upstairs so they can hear themselves. Then we heard my friend Ttanner who had just got off work and was coming over here for dinner with us in my new place “what the fuck why wouldnt you invite her she is you VPs girlfriends daughter and the rest of her family is here.” “she doesn't belong here” “oh I get it her stupid brothers and mother got into your ear. She isn't the trouble makcan'tt's them but have fun with that. Bye, I don't respect a president that believes the snake instead of investigating.” I send Star to get him and I look at Deacon and them and they are pissed.



# Chapter 3



Then I hear Star say “so do you plan to harass any one who shows up here or just those that consider Layla family? Go back to you party and stay off the property i know the house in in Laylas name so be careful before we put a security fence around so you cant fuck with her. Get a life and leave the 17 year old girl alone.” 



I say “don't worry about it for a few weeks and I'm moving back to Broken Arrow to go to school and open my tattoo shop.” “ok i wont say anything but if you get hurt i won't forgive them. Spirit MC is your family, we will never leave you alone.” We ate then they had to leave. Tanner and Star stay to help clean up. We go outside to the fire pit and start a fire and drink coffee while talking about graduation and opening the shop. We can hear them getting drunk and still no one comes over to invite me and my family forgot about me. my wolves are at my feet. Zero stands alert and looks behind me when I hear. “Do you think you are too good to come to the BBQ?” 



I turn and look and I see a younger version of the president. I'm guessing brother, “wasn't invited and was told I don't belong so if you have an issue with it take it up with im guessing it is your brother. But in all honesty I don't care to be over there. No one has spoken to me nicely since I got here and I didnt do shit to any of you so go back to your club patches you just pissed I don’t look at you like you walk on water.” Then he just storm’s off. These next few weeks will suck. “Well guys it's 11 I'm gonna call it a night. You can stay if you want or I will see you in a few days.” “We will stay then leave in the morning.” We will put the fire out and come down when we are done. “The couch has a pull out bed and I put a bed in the 2nd bedroom. goodnight.”



I walked into my room stripped then took a shower. I know Tann and Star are staying because they don’t trust them. I like when they are here. After I got out and got dressed I closed all the windows and locked them. I grab a cup of hot tea and go to my room and sit in my bean bag chair and draw the rest of my tattoo and 5 more for the shop.



I don't sleep well. I had nightmares of my ex hitting me after he said I shouldn't be upset that my dad is dead anymore. He locked me away for a weekend and did much worse. Deacon was out of town with Star and Tann. They are his kids. No one outside the MC. They really want to keep them safe. Deacon took me to the cabin where his mother Etta lived until I healed. My mother introduced me to Bobby, did she know what he was really like then I wonder. He can't find me right now but I think he's afraid to look, it’s not like I am hiding or anything. They taught me how to fight and use weapons after that happened. Now he is sending me threats saying he will do much worse if he ever finds me. Well I say bring it. I sent the newest message to Tech and Spirit MC. He will try to find him.



Tanner already set up the gym equipment where the dinner area is i dont need 2 of them. I'm just one person. Now I can train to make sure no one hurts me again. Since I can't sleep I might as well work out so I jump on the treadmill.



Star and Tann heard me and came to check on me. They come out and Tann and Star put gear on so we can box a little. They know I don't want to talk so Star is up first we start off with easy combos. Left, right, hook and then kick then repeat. we are both going back and forth then Tann comes in and tries to surprise me but doesn't then Star steps back and Tann tries to take me to the floor and I let him then after he is in side control I transition and now im on his back with one arm going under his chin then grabbed the other arm then the arm I grabbed goes back behind his head till my hand is on my other bicep then squeeze till he taps. Now we talk. 



The next night it was just me and my dogs tonight but that's ok they all had work and meetings. I went to take the trash out but the dogs were in the house when someone came up behind me and drugged me. I am in an out for days I feel the pain I knew they were raping me they left my face alone its like i was in and out but could never wake up enough to know who is here. 



I hear them talking and i think i hear that kid from my first night and Bobby what the fuck how did he find me then i felt a poke and i was out again. I woke up with Deacon next to me. “I found you outside my gate 3 days ago. We put you in a coma, we reset your bones and cleaned you up. I got all your school work. They think you have the flu and someone has been doing the work and we take it back we won't let them take more from you. they gave you drugs so you wont remember what happened but they did rape you and one of them branded you its a wolf ring mark so i have a clue who it is and tons of DNA but no matches yet. we gave you meds for pregnancy and for STDS you will be ok.""



# Chapter 4



Then he held me well. I cried then said “I heard Bobby and whatever his name is but I think it was Tank's brother.” It took me some more time to heal.



I have Tann go get the laptop and phone. I text my uncle and say sorry I lost the phone in the house and couldn't message. He probably won't believe me but that gives me a week to heal and get my shit in order. 2 days later I go home and my dogs are happy to see me. I need to train. So that's what I have done since they finished my schooling. I can build my muscles back up. 



One week later I'm sitting at my graduation and they call a lot of the biker kids names and Wolf MC yelled including my “family”. I was wearing a deep purple dress with black leggings and a black cap and gown. Then when my name was called only Tann, and Star yelled for me. Deacon had to go out of town for a meeting. He tried to move it but the other party didn’t agree and I saw my uncle out there but they are staying low key till my birthday. I didn't get to look at much on the laptop but I saw that the bitch isn't my mother. So they were not paying attention to me. That's what I thought would happen but it still stung.



I go to them and the 3 of us take a picture and I see Lisa standing there staring and my mother with hate so I look at her and I see her taking pictures with the graduates. So are my brothers. “Let's go guys.” We grabbed burgers from the diner and went home. I know they told Deacon what happened. I don't care if they do. Tann and Star also told him they haven't seen my family since we moved in. They are always at the MC and no one checks on me. hell they dont even text me.



We were watching a movie when Star said ""let's go, we wanna show you something.” So we hop on our bikers and I follow them to Spirit MC. I see a bonfire and a banner that says “Congratulations Ice”. I start crying and Rock comes and gives me a hug and says “we are proud of you.”



“Thank you everyone!” I yell so everyone can hear and I see the pile of presents on the table and the cake and Cook is at the grill. We go sit down in the chairs around the fire and Tann brings me a beer. we sit and talk and eat then I open my presents. My phone started dinging a lot. I saw it was my brother sending pictures of their party and the other grads getting presents from my “mother” so I sent a picture of my banner with all the presents in front of it. That will shut him up. Spirit MC didn’t have anyone graduating but me. Tann takes them to my room I have here and then Deacon hands me the deed to the shop I wanted. It was a gift. He puts it in his safe in his office till I’m in my own place. “Thank you everyone for everything you made this the best day I have had since dad died. I'm going to go now. I gotta let the dogs out” then head home.



I get home and I see Lisa walk over after I shut off my bike. “Hi Lisa, you know your brother will get mad if you're talking to me.” “oh well i don't appreciate what they are doing to you. Here congrats I saw you got valedictorian and a scholarship to Art school. That is amazing.” “Thank you and it's ok my dad was the only one in my corner I was right there when they shot him. My mom acts like she's mad. I got saved. I was sitting at the table and dad covered me too. I am sure that isn't how they tell it over there.” They know that they got nothing in his will but $100,000 each. Ghost and I got the rest that's why they hate me. My dad was rich. His dad was the Mafia boss in Tulsa till my Uncle Renegade or Rick, as only family can use his given name, took over so he had money. 



Then my phone rang. Senator Papa is what the screen said “hello senator how are you today?” That's how he knows I'm not alone and need to move to privacy. I wave bye to Lisa. I can't have her tell them I'm talking to him, even if she only does it by accident because mom hates him. I don't know why. “ “Congrats really loud from him and what sounds like everyone in the room over there.” “Thank you guys” “I was calling you to tell you we will meet you in Broken Arrow the day of your birthday we want to see you. We also want to help you pick out a house Nana said she has the perfect one hell she might have got it already. I heard her on the phone for security, a panic apartment and a 25 ft electric fence put up. if you don't like it i understand we can change it whatever you want but it has 200 acres with it.” “That sounds perfect, is it staying in Nana's name? I'm happy we all have reconnected since dad died. I feel like I have family again.” “No, we are putting in a false name so no one can find it if you don't want them too. Me too princess I’m happy uncle Rick found you. I love you princess, Nana loves you too.” “Ok good night see you in a week I love you and Nana too.”



I take a shower and sit by the window and see my family having fun without me and my mom never looks over here but I see Lisa walk up to them 10 minutes later and says “you all are awful people I'm moving back in with our parents. Tank dad will be pissed when he hears how you are acting."" Then she left with her car loaded full of stuff. That gives me an idea for before I move. His dad is going to get security feed of the night I was taken and all the feed since I moved in from here and from the MC as well. Then I look as my mom turns and I see she has a property of Vengeance on it. Well hell she got claimed and didn't invite me. hell she didn't even tell me it was going to happen.



# Chapter 5



I get up planning to go to bed. I will spend the next week packing and planning for the house my Papa got me. Then my phone rings and I look at the screen Uncle Rick. “Hey uncle, how are you doing?”



“Sorry to call so late princess. I was in a meeting then on a plane I just got off and now I'm calling to tell you congratulations and I will be there next week to go over what your dad left you and also to celebrate your birthday. Your dad protected you baby girl. I love you. I will see you in a week and we will catch up then.”



“Thank you uncle, I saw you in the very back. I know you couldn't come up and say hi till next week. I can't wait to see you. These people don't even know I exist. I love you too. Nana got me a house already so we will see what she has been up to together. Papa said she's making a compound.”



We talked for a few more minutes. Then I lay in bed for a while when I decided sleep wasn't coming to me. I got a cup of hot tea from my sketch pad and started drawing. A little later I hear “I bet that stuck up bitch is home. I don't know why she thinks she's too good for us but her mom needs to set her straight. all those invites her mom gave her and she still thinks she is good for us.”



Fine guess I will go set them straight. I got up and got dressed. I had my sword on my hip and my gun under my jacket and knives in my boots. I walk into the living room and see Twisted sitting in my living room “uncle sent you my favorite cousin. Let me guess he found out about the bitch across the street raping me and holding me for a few days im still healing where he branded my shoulder and a few cracked ribs. If he wants a picture now that is clearer it can wait, lets go have some fun. My mom is spreading lies again and I'm in a mood to set a few things straight. Oh and the only reason he caught me that day was because he drugged me from behind. I'm assuming you are moving in for the next week. I'm ok with that. I have a spare room.”



He nodded his head and walked out with me and we went across the street and stood right in front of my mom and said “I see congrats on in order what day did you get claimed” “the weekend we got here” “oh when I went missing and no one looked for me I was found by Tann and Star Raped and branded with a wolf ring. I wonder who that could have been. Thanks for caring about what happened to me, mother. Don't worry Uncle Rick sent Twisted to be my bodyguard he also said since you can't be a mother to anyone but the boys he will make sure I stay safe.”



“Who was talking near my cousin's room” and a few prospects walked up and said “us” “who said my cousin was told about this BBQ or her mother being claimed or any other event.” “Her mother did.” I tossed a clone of the family phone my mother made me take on the table in front of the president, not the phone my uncle gave me and said “here have whoever is your tech person look and see if she did. It is a clone of my phone so whatever they send me even in the future.” he grabbed and started looking through the phone frowning as he went. I had my uncle wipe anything I didn't want them to know. Everyone but these idiots message me on the phone that my uncle sent “oh you like those messages for my mom saying I owe her money right. for what I don’t know dad’s money paid for the house she never lives in and I never see her I have a job and pay my own way so what I owe her because my dad died saving my life not just my godmothers oh from the looks on your faces that's not the story she told. ask president decon he will send you the video.”



Someone walked up and grabbed my arm then they were on the ground. It's Tann under my foot when I look down and I let him up “I am so sorry Tann you startled me. keep the phone. I don't need to have fun with your family and I will with mine.”



“You ungrateful bitch so what if I didn't invite you; you had a roof over your head. You were just fine. I don't think you went missing, I think you just want to say that to make a scene."" Just then a video goes to all their phones showing masked men holding me and asking my mother for ransom on a video call to my mother. “Well there's proof that I was. I don’t care if you invite me, just stop running around telling people you did when we both know you didn't. It's pathetic to play the damn victime all the time when you're just a viper who takes advantage of people and I'm sure you will spin this in your favor when I leave.” One of my brothers tried to sneak up behind me and I spun and pulled my gun and put it to his forehead and said “wouldn't be trying to take cheap shots now would we” then kicked him across the fool they must have just waxed it he slid just a little too much. I turned and walked away with Twisted and Tann “keep you people in line mother before someone you don't want shows up to show you who you truly are. The senator says to say hello.”



# Chapter 6



We go back to my place and look at Twisted “your dad has a hack on that phone doesn't he” he nods “that's good that means he can't wipe it without uncles techs code.”



I was laying on Twisted's lap as I watched Gilmore Girls. I have been having lots of nightmares. They didnt drug me enough. I remember more than I will tell anyone but Nana. We then hear him yelling “her uncle wont let us whip the phone no matter how many times you try and he has all the information that is on it anyway so you are wasting your time.” Then I fell asleep on the couch thinking about how I'm tired of acting stupid i know I'm missing a lot of information but I know the people across the way are dirt and I can't wait to leave this crap hole.



It's been 1 week and nothing from my family, not even a happy birthday. It's July 10th 2017. I hear bikes pull up and I look at Twisted who has a big smile on his face. “Fuck Twisted did they bring the whole family to move me to the house Nana got me.” We all know the Men will listen to Nana before the Senator so I guess that's comforting. “Let's just say Nana has been waiting for this day since your brother got sent away and didn't want to put you in danger.” “well hell lets go, you know I hate surprises. It's bad enough some punk bitch across the street destroyed my bike after that video got sent out, I don't need more shit.”



Walking outside I see Wolf MC standing out front. Tank looks excited he thinks this is the contract my mom said she could get him. There is a limo and about 50 bikers from Twisted's MC he runs for his dad called Phoenix MC. Well hell he is in on it. I guess they just want to make sure I get to my new home without a problem and in style. Then the door opens and my uncle then grandparents get you. I see bikes on a trailer, one with a tarp on it. I look at them and run to their arms and say thank you for coming to get me. I have missed you. It's been too long. I started crying. I felt safe again, she thought they would never find me. It might have been 10 years but of course they knew where I was.



Then I hear my mom “I thought my ex husband said you could never see her again. when we left back then, what the fuck are you doing here?” Then you hear a smack and I see my Nana hit her. “You little bitch what makes you think you make rules for this family and tell them to me? I make the rules. I have the mafia behind me and my grandsons club, what do you have, a bunch of people who don't know anything about your lies or how you kidnapped my granddaughter.”



She didn't know I knew all of this because of the laptop. She was not my mom, my mom died protecting me in a fire that broke out.



Then I saw Stone, one of my Nana's bodyguards had a file to Tank the president before my mom could protest. Then Nana says “oh and we know none of those boys are my sons. We took a DNA test when they were little but my son loved your lying ass. Layla was born before you met my son. Her mother died saving her in a fire. I know you set it we all do but you killed the guard that saw you so we couldn't bring you before our council to have you killed. so when her dad died you should have never taken her. You knew she was supposed to come to us per his will so you left. We have known where she was but Layla wanted all the evidence against you. So if you don't want us coming after you for everything that is in that file, then never contact her again.”



My “brothers” were shocked as they looked at the DNA report. Uncle Rick says “oh and now only you get your payment for being his wife your sons get nothing.” She was screaming how unfair it was that I was an ungrateful bitch and I don't even know what else. Then I hear another smack. Vengeance hit her and yelled “you are no longer a valkyrie you will move to another room I can't believe you lied to us. You said you never went over there because she abused you. What else have you lied about from the size of that file a lot? I’m sorry Layla, I shouldn't have believed her without proof. I loved her blindly. I should have seen the snake behind the innocent act. I know that's not an excuse. I promise I will do better.” I let go of Papa and kicked her right in the liver then left straight and right hook to the face as I looked down at her “now you can say I hurt you. Any other time was self defence. The code to the camera is pineapple. You will even see who took me that night from right outside my apartment door when I took the trash out and everything else that women did and said when she would disappear upstairs for a while. She didn’t know they were there. Oh and just so you know it's already been backed up and sent to Papa so you cant lie now mother.”



We turn and walk to the back of the house but not before she grabs my hair and I hit the floor. The wind is knocked out of me. Then I see Nana proceed to beat her ass. She can kick ass for being 55. but my mom can't fight, she can only slap everyone who is laughing at her till my Papa grabs Nana and they stop. I take one last kick and say. “Touch me again and it will be your head and they will never find your body. You know what my uncle can do.”



Then my uncle said something none of us knew “should have stayed with me and been a good wife but no you thought he was going to be in charge looks like that bit you in the ass. Goodbye Missy, I hope things work out for you. the lifestyle you love will never be yours again. Your father sent you this letter. He disowned you 3 years ago and here is the paperwork to prove it. Does the MC want to buy this house if it doesn't belong to her? She used Layla's allowance to buy it.”



Tank then says “I will buy it back. I didn't know her mother used her money or the rest of what's in this file. i dont allow violence to women and children.” “Well watch the camaras then you will be in for one hell of a surprise.”



We walked to the side of the house and I saw there was a big picnic set up with a happy birthday Ice on a banner hanging on the house. We ate the loaded up everything that belonged to me. one of my brothers isn't here. He is my dads too. He left for the military 10 years ago and we haven't seen him since. I write to him and i dont tell him everything. They don't need the stress of his team to get letters too. There's my brother Ghost, and his team Panther, Shooter and Speed.



I was lost in thought about how Ghost doesnt know Shooter and Speed are related to us or the fact that i investigate all them idiots when shots rang out and I felt pain in my lower back and shoulder so I turned and saw one of the guys who kidnapped me and raped me standing next to my mom as she shot me for the final time in the chest. She shot me 3 times before papa turned around and shot her in the chest 50/50 chance she would live. Well hell then I blacked out from the pain and loss of blood. I did get a knife thrown at her but hit the dumb ass next to her in the shoulder.



# Chapter 7



\*\*Uncle Rick Pov\*\*



I carry Ice to the limo while telling the others to finish packing. She is never coming back here. The president has the info on who their dad is so he can deal with the mess. He should have done a background check on them.



I’m sitting in the waiting room at our compound we made for her to be safe. I can't believe this happened to my princess. I wonder how I fell in love with such a bitch and she shot my niece for nothing. We never should have listened to my easy to fool brother and kept her away from Layla and Ghost. I knew something bad was going to happen. Then the dr comes out. “ She will be ok but one hit her in her lower spine, shoulder and chest. she will need lots of time to get out of a wheelchair and she will need lots of help.” “ok doc we will make sure she gets all the help she needs as long as she needs it. lets let her rest.”



\*\*Layla's POV\*\*



I woke up to beeping noises. Fuck I’m really hating waking up this way. I look around and see I'm in one of my grandparents' hospitals. Then I saw Tann and Star. Tann says “I will get Dove so she can check you out.” They left and then my Grandparents and Uncle came in. Fuck that stupid crazy bitch.



“Princess, you have been out for 3 days. I know you love to ride, we will get your legs back. The swelling needs to go down and then you can start physical therapy. Star talked to your teachers and they will let you switch to online. Tann and Star haven't left your side. Star and Tann are taking classes so they can be with you to help you. We aren’t going to bring in strangers with the bitch and her boys still alive. I called your brother Panther's phone and he said he will be here soon. He and his buddies just got discharged 2 days ago. He said he wishes your dad wouldn't have sent him away so he could have protected you. I think your step mother made your dad send him away.”



“Well hell what else is new that bitch is always doing something stupid. Please tell me she is dead and I have a cool chair since I have to be in one."" Then uncle Mike, one of my bodyguards when I was little, comes in with his son Kevin. They are only supposed to guard me when I'm with my uncle but I see Kevin still watching. He said to me one time I was like the sister he lost before my uncle found them and it was his job to protect me. “Well I see my shadow is still here. Thank you for watching me all these years. I know you watched me during the day when you could. The things that happened wasn't your fault they waited till you left and switched with your dad to take me” they just nod. “princess they will be head of security for you we are at your compound Nana started making for you. You are still our mafia princess so we need to keep you safe. No she's not dead.”



So a man with good aim didn't get her the head. Well, I can't wait to see the video of what happened. Why didn't he kill Missy? I put on a im stupid and don't know shit smile and say “Papa, I have been shot 3 times. I think I could use some protection I can fight but it seems they are determined and now that she is down for now but she has been teaching them boys to be hateful . I need to see my file. I know she got my chest, lower back and leg.” I hate that they haven't been protecting me and they want me to trust them now. I hate playing this long game, “Princess your right your heart will be weak for a while. They said it will take 2 to 3 years to get you back to being able to do everything you do now.” “thank you papa for always being truthful with me. So house arrest just with friends, family and Physical therapy and school i can deal with that.”



Ghost, Panther Shooter and Speed walked in with a Starbucks iced coffee and a Mcdonalds bag. Ghost looks like a younger version of dad. Dirty Blonde hair, blue eyes and about 6 ft 5 in. Let's see if he is any different. “I'm so glad you are awake. Now that you are 18 nothing can keep me from protecting you like I should have been allowed to do all this time.” They all give me hugs and Ghost looks pissed while he looks at a phone.



“Is that mine yours know they have a clone of mine if i can guess our stepbrothers are making threats. They are nothing but teens. Let me call her dad. He will fix them and hand me the cloned phone real quick.”



He hands it to me and I look till I find bitches dad. He picked up as I put it on speaker phone. “are you ok layla did she hurt you again?” “Well yes she did. she shot me 3 times and Papa shot her in the chest, im sorry but can you meet us at the address im going to send you we have lots to tell you and bring the brats dad I know he moved to be in your MC with you after your daughter took his boys if he is a member now he can take them from her now and she can't do anything her new guy did not claim them. I know where they are and they need someone to kick them in the ass. She is making them just like her” I sent the address. He says “ok you are 30 minutes away and we will be there soon.”",1,1747136886.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False
1kljtsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/1kljtsg/my_maga_family_story/,My MAGA Family Story,"Hi everyone! This sub has been recommended to me many times over, & if you look at my post history you can see some entertaining stories about my MAGA family. Please buckle up for my long ass post.

My parents have always leaned right, but it wasn’t to the point they are today. Have they always been racists? Absolutely, my mom told me  when I was 5 that Noah didn’t mix & match the animals when he put them on the ark but that he paired them. At the same time though, they weren’t as outright with it, & as a kid it was confusing as fuck. For example, she would make comments about POC that were massive stereotypes, but at the same time talk about how bad sundown towns & the KKK were & showed fear of them. My dad was a silent generation guy that bagged himself a boomer wife 25 years his junior. Make of that & what he believed what you will.

Anyways, around 1995 my family got the big cable package, & Fox News became our nightly news source. I had to listen to Bill O’Reilly & his ilk. Limbaugh started playing on my dad’s AM stations in the car. Then 1996 happened. I was 12, & I honestly remember clear as day the changes that year. Fox News began running 24-7 in our house because it became a 24-7 channel that year. Less Star Trek, less reruns of MASH, & my mom started pushing shows like 7th Heaven for me to watch. She definitely banned me from shows like Fresh Prince that year, because she saw pieces of the episode where Carlton wants to go to a dangerous park after dark. She thought it was a terrible influence on me to watch a show about an affluent, smart, & funny black family. At the same time they never missed an address from Fox News, & in 2000 George Bush happened & became their savior from the evil left.

Over the years it got progressively worse. My mom didn’t want me to attend the university I chose because it was “too black”. My dad stated that they regretted letting me attend the school because all it taught me was to become a leftist. Obama became president & the first few months I was admittedly terrified because of all the years I spent listening to my parents & Fox. I eventually broke off from that, formed a solid group of friends, & got my head on straight. My parents however continued to fall further down the rabbit hole.

I moved to MS for a few years in 2011, & that is where I truly learned what we are fighting against with MAGA & who we are fighting for. Those few years truly opened my eyes, & I rarely went home for holidays & to visit. My parents would only talk about Obama & “his evil cabal”. Meanwhile, I was learning the history of POC in MS from friends & roommates. Then in 2014 El Cheeto Benito started those orange rumors he was running. All bets were off at that point.

My parents went hardcore MAGA & never looked back. Every POC killed by police deserved it in their eyes because they had a previous criminal record or drug use. Every single mother who wasn’t white was a welfare queen. Regan suddenly became our greatest president next to El Cheeto, & I, their youngest & daughter, became enemy #1. My views were challenged, if I brought up a view point or question from the other side…well god help me because there was so.much.yelling from them. Keep in mind at this point I am well into adulthood.

2017 is the start of El Cheetos first reign of terror, & in front of my future husband (first time meeting him at that), my dad asked what I had against El Cheeto. I said I didn’t like him & didn’t want to discuss it further. My dad called me a communist & socialist, & I screamed I can only be one of those things. Not the best family trip nor first time for the now husband to meet the parents.

The next few years were miserable at best, then we had COVID. My parents fought tooth & nail that it was just a bad cold, until Christmas of 2020 when my uncle knowingly got in a vehicle with a friend who had COVID, & proceeded to pass it along to my parents. My dad being an older guy had to be airlifted to a hospital & put on a ventilator on Christmas Day 2020. I spent the next 2 weeks commuting 2 hours one way back & forth with little to no sleep, staying in a hotel, & sitting in a hospital parking lot as my mom was snuck in to see my dad in the wee morning hours.

On January 8, at roughly 8:00 AM my dad took his last breath. The saddest part is that he wanted Fox News on the entire time he was hospitalized. He watched what happened on January 6 & from family accounts of those that got to speak to him, he supported it. Less than a week later as I was at my moms house working, my niece doing online school, & my mom & brother decided to talk about how horrible the democrats are & that the election was rigged.

I said some things, they said some things. My beautiful half Asian niece heard me call her dad & grandmother racists & tell them if the racist shoe fits perfectly then to wear it proudly. I regret saying that in front of her as she was only 10 at the time. Since then it’s only gotten worse.

My mom refused the military honors thingy sent by the government for my dad because it was signed by Biden. She somehow got us all ones with El Cheetos signature & I refused it. She constantly repeats Facebook & Fox News drivel swearing it’s true. She has stopped believing in the advancement & evolution of science…she has a masters in fucking BIOLOGY! She talks about how hard her sons & grandson have it being white men…She’s okay with El Cheetos comments & behavior towards women because if those women didn’t want the attention they shouldn’t have dressed like that or sat on the arm rest of someone’s chair. 

My entire family has literally voted for the worst possible future for my husband (who’s Jewish) & myself (registered democrat, prescribed mental health meds, & much more). It used to be that if the apocalypse hit or the US went sideways, we’d go to my family where they have been prepping for this shit their whole lives for some reason, but that’s no longer a safe option.

Like arrows in a quiver, our blessings (family, ministry, service) can sometimes feel sharp and heavy. But when we carry them in our own strength, we suffer. When we surrender them back to God, we soar.

The work God gives us, being parents, partners, pastors, friends—is sacred. But it’s not meant to break us. It’s meant to form us. If we feel broken, it may be time to release the burdens we were never meant to carry.

And if you’ve ever thought, “I can’t do this anymore,” don’t condemn yourself. God isn’t asking you to do more. He’s inviting you to be still and know He is enough.

Don’t burn out!” is easier said than done. Jesus said, “My yoke is easy”—it’s not just about stopping exhaustion, but changing how you carry the load. Trust Him differently.

Feeling like you’re not enough? Social media hides others' struggles. God anointed you for your path, not theirs. Don’t measure your worth by someone else’s highlight reel.

Fatigue is stealing the joy out of our service. Social media hides others' struggles. God anointed you for your path, not theirs. Don’t measure your worth by someone else’s highlight reel.

It’s not your schedule stealing peace, it’s inattention to now. Trust Jesus, rest, sow, stay present. God’s kairos redeems every season. Let God be God.",1,1747136699.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

We have quite an erratic relationship, our main problem is that everything turns into an argument. He takes me saying that something he does eg when he drinks all my orange juice and doesnt tell me or replace it it annoys me and could he please buy more, as an attack of his character and goes into defence mode and gets angry/ upset. It’s always trivial things but things I should be able to express my feelings on to a 33 year old man. I went in to hospital to get surgery (non emergency) 2 days ago and they told me I was pregnant so I decided it would be best to postpone it until I’d made a decision on what to do with. I told my bf i couldnt get the surgery but didn’t want to talk about why just yet. He woke up in a terrible mood and lashed out at me literally just asking if he could make me a coffee while he was downstairs and asked me to leave his house. I broke down in tears and said that I was pregnant. He accused me of saying that to get an upper hand and ro make him get me a coffee. He said i had intentionally gotten mysekf pregnant to manipulate him and that he knew I wasn’t on birth control. I was, I was taking my pill on time every day but of course it’s not 100% accurate. He said I’d lied and trapped him and now I have to deal with the consequences. He told me to leave. I just stood there in shock and he got up and pushed me out his door (not forcefully he just led me by my shoulders) and then he locked the door behind me. I went home and he texted me and basically said hes sorry for kicking me out but it’s tough love and that if he didn’t I will assume he will do everything for me. I know keeping this baby is probably not a great idea but I just don’t know if I can get rid of it. It’s 3.5 months and basically a fully formed baby at this point and I just don’t know what to do. He said he would step up and be a father if he has to but I just don’t know if I believe it",1,1747136684.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

We started talking about a week and a half ago after I kissed him at a party I was at, we had our first date last Thursday, we got coffee and hit it off well and I invited him back to mine and we just made out. 
I was headed home for Mother’s Day (I live up at my college) so Saturday night I asked him if he wanted to get coffee and have a second date when I was on the way back up to college and he said he’d love to but would check his schedule and let me know. 
He never did so I texted him at 4pm yesterday asking how his day was, no response okay weird we talked and he expressed sometimes talking stages can be overwhelming for him let me give him space… he posted on his story and liked the reels I sent him, still no text. 9pm comes around I double text him asking if he still wants to do coffee… again nothing. It’s 11pm when he finally responds and he says sorry for the late response i had a friend over, I’d have loved to but I’m helping my parents so I can’t and I tell him it’s fine and ask if we are still on for this weekend (I work the morning shift Friday and asked if he wanted to spend the night) and no response, he did respond to the snap I sent him which was a tit pic and called me perfect and responded to a pic of the flowers I got for him for our coffee date and he called them beautiful.

Do I pull back? Did he change his mind? I just don’t know the vibes since he’s so weird about texting and either responds asap or takes ages to respond, we do text everyday but he takes hours to respond and I’m second guessing if I want to continue this since he can respond to my reels and snaps but not my texts :/ ",1,1747136524.0,dating_advice,11,1.0,False

Now this is where you, as my accountability buddy, would come in… I’d need you to make sure that I’m following through with my plan of only drinking milk tea/boba once every 3 days or more.

Okay, so if I’m unable to follow through with my plan, I’d need to pay/save 200php per day. So if it’s supposed to be 3 days of no milk tea, but I drank one, I’d need to pay 200php x 3 days = 600php.

How would it be beneficial for you? I’ll treat you out if and when the money saved reaches 1k, or we can talk about another option.

I'm a foreigner living in Korea. I've learned how to live in small apartments here. It can be hard at first, but there are ways to make these tiny homes work well.

Let's share ideas to make the most of small Korean apartments. Tell us your best tips for saving space. We can help each other make our homes comfy and useful, no matter how small they are.

## Ways to Save Space in Korean Homes

### Furniture and Decorations

1. **Furniture that does more than one thing:** Use ottomans with storage inside. Get coffee tables with hidden spaces. Buy beds with drawers built in.

2. **Shelves on the walls:** Put up shelves to use wall space. This keeps the floor clear and helps organize your stuff.

3. **Beds up high:** Use loft beds or bunk beds. This gives you room under the bed for a desk or chairs.

### Keeping Things Tidy

1. **Get rid of stuff you don't need:** Look at your things often. If you don't use something, give it away.

2. **Smart storage:** Use vacuum bags and special hangers to save space in closets.

### Clever Space-Saving Ideas

1. **Sliding doors:** These take up less room than regular doors that swing open.

2. **Furniture with hidden storage:** Look for tables and chairs that have secret spaces to put things.

3. **Use space under the bed:** Store things you don't use often under your bed.

## Wrap-Up

Living in Korea means dealing with small homes. But with some good ideas, you can make your tiny apartment feel bigger and work better.

I hope these tips help you make the most of your space. Now it's your turn - what are your best ideas for saving space? Tell us how you've made your small Korean home work for you!",1,1747136224.0,ithome,0,1.0,False

Antonio found me clearing last night's untouched birthday feast when he came home.Yesterday was his birthday.He said he would bring friends over for the celebration, so I took half a day off to prepare.I waited till midnight.I wouldn't have known he changed plans if I hadn't seen Valda's ""best birthday party ever"" post.""Made the cake yourself?""He smirked, smearing frosting across my cheek. When I nodded, he snorted, ""No wonder it looks so janky.""Back then, those words would've crushed me. I'd have argued until my face turned red.Now? Not worth the breath.Watching me scrub dishes, Antonio cleared his throat. ""Grace, I brought you seafood pasta.""""Saw it.""He always did this—brought comfort food after ripping me apart.It was our unspoken truce ritual.""Let me heat it up.""He vanished into the kitchen before I could refuse.Ten minutes later, smoke curled out.Antonio stayed in the bedroom, so I had to turn off the stove myself.Steam rose from the reheated pasta as his phone lit up on the counter.A message from Valda.""Thanks for last night, Tony Bear. Best night EVER.""Before I could look away, his icy voice cut through, ""Snooping through my stuff again?""""I wasn't— Ow!""He shoved past me.Scalding pasta splashed across my left hand.Antonio shot me an exasperated look. ""You're hopeless.""I gritted my teeth and followed him out the door to the hospital.As soon as I got in the car, Valda's custom sticker caught my eye: ""PRINCESS THRONE VALDA'S SPOT!""Antonio grimaced. ""She... thought it'd be funny.""""Kind of is,"" I said flatly.He kept glancing at me while driving.""Aren't you going to peel that off?""I blinked.Why would I?Old Grace would've ripped it off immediately.But now? I didn't even care about Antonio himself.Why would I care about the women around him?""Just drive. I've got work soon.""At my quiet urging, Antonio stepped on the gas.We were one turn from the hospital when Valda's custom ringtone blared—some breathy pop song.""Tony... my head's killing me..."" Her whimper filled the car. ""Last night's champagne...""Without a word, Antonio U-turned toward Valda's apartment.""Left some documents upstairs,"" he lied, grabbing hangover pills I'd packed for him. ""Be right back.""Then he locked the car and went upstairs.One hour. Thirty-three degrees Celsius. No AC.Inside the sweltering car, I waited until I nearly passed out from dehydration. Antonio never came back.Shattering the window with the emergency hammer, I crawled out lips blue, shirt drenched. A security guard called 911.That evening, Antonio found me eating takeout.""Grace."" He stared at my bandaged hand. ""Where's my portion?""

**Chapter 2**

He knew my injured hand couldn't cook.So why hadn't I ordered for him?He did text me thirty minutes ago saying he'd be home.Eight years of marriage meant I'd always dropped everything to respond.My shrug caught him off guard. ""Phone was charging. Missed your text.""Antonio thrust a gift bag at me, jaw tight.""Your perfume's almost empty.""I kept chewing sesame chicken. ""Give it to Valda. Too fancy for me.""The Gucci bag in Valda's latest post featured his Vacheron Constantin watch in the background.When my bandaged hand reached for more fries, he grabbed my wrist.""Let me—""I jerked back. The perfume bottle smashed against the floorboards.""Christ, Grace!"" He kicked glass shards aside. ""You're still pissed about this morning's wait?""""Not pissed.""""Bullshit."" His laugh turned cruel. ""Thirty-two going on thirteen. Still throwing silent treatments like some lovesick teenager.""Three years older, I'd endured his jabs about my age and ""empty head"" for years.He'd savor my meltdowns, camera ready for the waterworks.Tonight, I didn't cry.I simply replied, ""Think what you want.""Gathering takeout containers, I grabbed my purse.Old Grace would've staged dramatic exits hoping he'd chase her.But today, I just left. He followed me to the elevator for the first time ever. ""Where the hell are you going?""""Mom's. She's got veggies.""The doors closed on his stunned face.Two hours later at the wine bar, my phone buzzed.Antonio: ""?""Carly Brennan gasped at the screen. ""You're ignoring him? He'll lose it.""Our friend group knew me as the queen of placating his tantrums.I ordered another round instead.2:47 AM. Antonio stood chugging water when I returned. No questions. No glances.He didn't care where I went, and I ignored him, going straight to the bathroom.As soon as I lay down on the bed, Antonio snuggled up to me.I shoved him off after three seconds.""Grace."" He flicked on the nightstand lamp, furious. ""It's your fertility window.""We weren't child-free by choice.These scheduled attempts were our last thread.Rolling over, I mumbled into the pillow. ""I'm exhausted.""Hearing the rejection he'd used countless times come from my own mouth, Antonio stood there stunned.The guestroom door slammed minutes later.I knew he'd be sleeping there for the next few days.Old Grace would've sobbed till dawn.But tonight, I slept nine hours straight.The next morning, I aced three presentations.When my boss joked about rewards, I slid over a sticky note, ""That divorce lawyer you mentioned.""Day nine of separate bedrooms. Antonio made my favorite bacon-egg skillet before noon, then retreated to sleep till 3 PM.That afternoon, his childhood buddy's wedding photos flooded our group chat.There stood Antonio, Valda clinging to his arm like a blushing bride.The group photo went viral in five minutes. Antonio called.""Grace, don't get the wrong idea. Ray's wedding was midweek, so...""""Why would I?""""You're not mad?""""Why would I be?""He cleared his throat. ""Wait at your office after work. I'll pick you up for dinner.""The call ended before I could refuse.Valda occupied the passenger seat when his Porsche arrived.""Oh, Grace tagging along?""I smiled coolly at her sarcasm and opened the back-car door.Antonio kept catching my eye in the rearview mirror during the drive.I just kept looking at my phone, giving brief replies before falling silent.Ray Martin greeted us in the private dining room. ""Damn shame you missed my vows, Grace.""I knew it meant let's appease the jealous wife.However, I wasn't mad at all.""Happy belated."" I headed straight for the charcuterie board.Noticing I had no intention of delving deeper, Ray gaped.He had covered Antonio's ""business trip"" to Cabo with Valda for months.Once, I'd confronted with hotel receipts in his own driveway.He was never this shocked back then.Halfway through truffle risotto, the manager brought three Bordeaux bottles. ""Mr. Kaufman, shall we open yours and Miss Valda's reserve?""Silence choked the room. ""Pour them all,"" I said, excusing myself.Antonio cornered me near the restroom. ""Those were for closing the Henderson deal.""I shrugged and entered the restroom.Returning, I found him gulping wine meant for Valda's glass.Two years ago, nearly identical scene.They'd shoved shots at my allergy-swollen throat while Antonio pinned my jaw open.""Just fucking drink. I'll pump your stomach after.""That night's fever birthed different pain days later - ER lights blinding me as doctors said, ""Chemical pregnancy.""""Should've stayed home like I told you!"" Antonio had screamed over hospital beeps. ""This is why women shouldn't show off in front of men!""Grabbing my bag, I walked out.Home. Midnight. Antonio slammed the door.""What's your damage? Humiliating me like that!""Silence. He ripped off his tie. ""Fine. Let's divorce.""The second time he'd said those words.The first was over ""snooping"" his texts.I'd groveled then, snot dripping on his shoes, swearing eternal obedience.""Okay,"" I said.

**Chapter 3**

The living room clock ticked louder than his breathing.""Grace,"" Antonio gripped the sofa arm. ""Say that again.""""I said yes. Let's divorce.""Pulling the asset division papers from the coffee table drawer, I caught his flinch.""You're... actually serious?""I blinked. ""Do people fake divorce?""His laughter cracked like cheap veneer. ""Playing hard to get now? Pathetic.""The garage door shook the house when he left.Fifteen days. No calls. No texts.3:12 AM. Ray's number flashed.""Tony's trashed my bar. Come get him.""""Let him crash at your place. Try Valda's number.""Come on, I was helping him.Key jangled at dawn. Antonio reeked of bourbon and regret.He ""accidentally"" watched my shows every night.""Forgot"" his laptop charger in our bedroom daily.Flooded my office with crimson peonies - 999 stems each [morning.In](http://morning.In) the past, I would've posted every bouquet on Instagram.But now, I let them rot in reception.Antonio seemed to have forgotten about the divorce.I decided to follow my lawyer's advice and wait for the right moment.""Grace! We're in VIP 7!"" Carly's text chimed as I entered the lounge.Fingers dug into my shoulder before I found the room.""Following me?""Antonio's drunken grin wavered. ""Could've texted.""He dragged me into neon-lit chaos. Valda materialized in my anniversary gift - the custom-tailored overcoat he'd claimed, ""lost in Detroit.""""Who knew Grace liked dive bars?""Valda purred, sleeve brushing his thigh. ""Tony said you're a prudish wallflower.""I recognized the custom coat Valda wore. It was the anniversary gift I gave Antonio last year.I had wanted him to wear it to accompany me to the Kaufman family dinner, but he claimed he'd lost it on a business trip in Detroit.When I muttered what a pity, he exploded, ""It's just an ugly, out-of-season coat. You're questioning me like an interrogator? Maybe I should get you a brain specialist. Your stupid head really needs it.""Antonio introduced me to his so-called old friends, and as they teased him for being a ""henpecked husband,"" he watched me with a smile.When they egged us on to duet a love song, Valda draped the coat over me, saying, ""You're dressed so lightly. I'm worried you'll catch a cold.""Antonio, seeing me in the coat I'd thought was lost, grabbed me anxiously and explained, ""It suddenly got cold in Detroit, and Valda didn't bring any thick clothes... I had no choice but to lend her mine.""Focused on replying to Carly's message, I ignored Antonio. ""Never mind.""Just then, Carly sent a photo of a mysterious guest's profile.I immediately handed the microphone to Valda and told Antonio, ""You two sing together. I have something to do.""Before Antonio could speak, Valda stepped forward, tears welling up, and said, ""Grace, are you still misunderstanding Tony and me? We're not what you think.""As Valda wished, I saw the exquisite tattoo on her inner arm—a sword and a rose.I had seen the same pattern on Antonio two months ago.Meeting Antonio's panicked gaze, I did something unexpected.

J'ai besoin de votre aide pour ma recherche d'alternance.

Je suis en train de finir ma dernière année de licence à la faculté d'économie et de gestion d'Aix-en-Provence et j'ai été accepté à l'IAE Aix-Marseille pour le MSc 1 Management dès la rentrée prochaine. À la suite de cette année, j'aimerais faire le MSc 2 International Finance.

Mais voilà, j'aimerais faire une alternance à Paris dans le domaine de la finance. Ça fait au moins un mois et demi que j'ai commencé à postuler dans les grands groupes bancaires (Société Générale, Crédit Agricole, etc.), dans des fintechs ou des cabinets de conseil pour le poste d'analyste financier ou de business analyst.

Déjà, je suis vraiment assez ouvert en termes d'emploi, je connais encore assez mal la finance (même si j'ai quelques notions) et j'aimerais profiter de mes alternances pour m'orienter encore un peu plus. Aussi, j'aimerais travailler dans le monde du cinéma. Donc j'ai cherché chez StudioCanal, Pathé, etc. Je regarde aussi chez Webedia dans le sens où je connais très bien YouTube et Twitch.

Avez-vous des conseils concernant les intitulés de postes à rechercher ? Des idées de boîtes intéressantes (même des start-up) ? Je suis ouvert à tout tant que ça peut rentrer dans ma formation et je peux même faire des candidatures spontanées.

J'ai eu un appel avec une ancienne étudiante de l'ESSEC qui m'a donné pas mal de conseils. Elle m'a bien fait comprendre que le marché était compliqué et que ça n'allait pas être simple, mais je suis vraiment déterminé à trouver quelque chose d'intéressant à Paris. Elle m'a dit que les CV étaient très classiques et en anglais. Donc j'ai fait deux versions différentes (que je mets dans le post). 

Selon vous, lequel est le mieux ? Avez-vous des conseils même ?

J'ai vraiment envie de renvoyer des candidatures, mais depuis cet appel j'ai peur de mal faire quelque chose et donc d'envoyer des candidatures dans le vide.

Merci pour vos réponses !

My wife (30F, resident doctor) and I (33M, corporate guy) tackled the US B1/B2 visa process in New Delhi for a June trip. Struggled to find a one-stop guide, so here’s our concise story with tips, hoping it helps!

My wife was invited to present at a medical conference on the East Coast (proud husband cues). We planned to explore cities in east coast and visit a relative somewhere midsouth. With strong profiles (combined 70-80 LPA, travels to Japan, SE Asia, Europe/UK for me), we were confident but braced for bureaucracy.

# Step 1: DS-160 Form

The DS-160 was long but doable online. Triple-check entries and save often—the system loves logging you out.

# Step 2: Appointment Booking

Booking via usvisascheduling.gov.in was tough. Adding my wife as a dependent took weeks of emails and calls. Securing early slots (VAC biometrics + consular within 30 mins) was a lottery—slots showed for next year! I checked half-hourly, got locked out once, then used checkvisaslots.com’s paid plan. On April 13, 2-3 PM, I snagged a VAC slot for April 23 and consular for May 5. Tip: DIY with vigilance or consider an agent if rushed.

# Step 3: VAC Appointment (April 23)

At 9 AM, we parked at NDMC Multilevel Parking Capitol Place and walked to the VFS center (Shivaji Stadium metro). Reddit tipped us: car keys (electric knob) were fine, so we left electronics behind. A 50-70 person queue took 30 mins to enter; staff checked DS-160s, passports, and confirmation letters. Inside, biometrics (fingerprints, photo) took another 30 mins. Total: \~1 hour. Staff were strict but kind. Tip: Confirm car key rules (my wife was a hawk double sure-ing it with the guards); bring only required docs.

# Step 4: Consular Appointment (May 5)

We prepped answers (purpose, itinerary, work, funds) over 2-3 evenings, aiming for confidence, not scripts. At 9:45 AM, we arrived early, parked at Malcha Market after confusing guard directions, and took a 50-buck auto to the embassy. Security was quick; car keys were allowed. In the waiting hall, we got first-row seats and entered in 5 mins. Inside, passport scans and biometrics took 15 mins, then a 20-min queue for the interview. Overheard rejections often tied to nerves or DS-160 issues.

Our **interview** was smooth:

VO: Good morning *(to both of us)*, please pass me your passports

Me: Good morning officer, yes please, here are the passports*...(then i added after handing over)..*How are you today?

 VO: *(looking up after picking up the passport and with a little smile)* I am good, how are you doing?

 Me: I’m good too! *(Eye contact, chill vibes)*

 VO: So why do you want to go the US?

 Me: My wife is going to present her paper at \[conference\] at \[city\] and we will explore \[city\] along with XX city in east coast and also go to YY city to meet our relative before coming back*.....(before he could ask next Q, i added one more detail)....*she has been invited to present

 VO: *(looking at my wife)* What is your research about?

 Wife: *Explains her research paper in clear, concise terms*

 VO: *(looking at me me briefly)* What do you do?

 Me: *(Confirming if he is referring to me)* You are asking about me? 

 VO: Yes

 Me: I am in \[domain\] research and currently working as a \[job title\] at \[full company name\]

 VO: Do you have any kids?

 Me: No.

 VO: How long will you be staying in the US?

 Me: 10 days, from \[start date\] to \[end date\]

 VO: Congrats, your visas are approved! You shall get them in 7-10 days.

 Me: *(smiling)* Thank you officer, have a lovely rest of the day

 VO: *(smiling)* You too  


The VO had just denied the previous guy for sounding scripted—nerves are real! We left grinning, took an auto, and celebrated at a cafe with coffee and a giant cookie. Total time: \~1 hour.

# Tips

* Slots: [Checkvisaslots] helped, but it’s a lottery. DIY with focus or use an agent.
* Parking: VAC = NDMC Capitol Place; Embassy = Malcha Market. Budget time or take an auto.
* Docs: DS-160, passport, confirmation for VAC; definitely carry purpose proof (e.g., invite) for embassy, however its good to carry supporting docs wherever possible.
* Interview: Be confident, honest, concise. Don’t argue with the VO—saw someone’s denial get worse.
* Car Keys: Usually fine; confirm with guards
* Reddit: Past posts are gold for preps

# Final Thoughts

It’s a grind, but prep and persistence pay off. That cookie tasted like victory! Good luck—hope you’re munching your own soon!

Cheers!

# Chapter 1



Isabella



The piercing alarm yanked me from a dream that left my skin burning and my breath ragged. Three powerful figures with glowing eyes prowled around me, their scents flooding my senses, carrying something raw and utterly irresistible.



What the fuck is wrong with me?



I slammed the alarm off, staring at the cracked ceiling of my rundown apartment. Cheap curtains barely filtered the morning light, draping the room in a dull, gray haze.



My business administration textbooks teetered in a shaky stack by the bed, next to my two neatly folded uniforms—a blue polka-dot dress for Twilight Café and a tight white crop top with black shorts for Night Howl Bar.



Two years ago, I, Isabella Hart, left the Forest Domain—a remote village tucked away in ancient woods. My Omega parents were low-status in the local pack, toiling endlessly for meager rewards.



Despite the hardship, they never let me see their complaints. They pinched every penny to send me to Silver Moon University. To them, I was their only hope—if I could earn a degree, maybe I’d break the chains of our Omega family’s generational curse.



Tomorrow night, I turn eighteen—a pivotal moment in every werewolf pack. My family kept reminding me how crucial this birthday is, because on that day, my wolf will fully manifest, and I might sense who my fated mate is.



But they stayed silent about these sudden… urges. I didn’t dare ask anyone—as a lowlife Omega, our tribe barely tolerated us, and nobody cared about our troubles. Mom always said it wasn’t odd for wolves like us to have certain “filthy” reactions. Either way, tomorrow night will reveal everything, and I’m both thrilled and terrified of the moment.



What the fuck is wrong with me? I wasn’t like this before. I could feel my body changing, like a tide surging out of control—heart racing, throat parched, even my fingertips trembling. No, don’t think about those depraved things!



I forced myself to sit up, wincing as the sheet grazed my sensitive nipples. The dripping faucet in the bathroom provided an irritating soundtrack to my torment.



The clock’s red digits jolted me from my thoughts. Damn. I was going to be late.



I rushed through a shower, but it did nothing to soothe my burning skin—if anything, the water droplets felt like tiny electric shocks. I threw on the Twilight Café uniform, the fabric feeling unnaturally rough against my hypersensitive body. No time for breakfast.



On the street, humans passed by oblivious, but every now and then, a werewolf would turn their head, nostrils flaring slightly. I quickened my pace, eyes glued to the ground.



“This is the third time this month, Hart. One more late punch, and I’m cutting your hours.” Ms. Cooper’s tight face showed no sympathy as I clocked in three minutes late.



“Sorry, it won’t happen again.” I tied my apron with trembling fingers.



“It better not. Cashier two—Julian called in sick.”



My heart sank. Julian was my only friend, the only wolf I could talk to. Without him as a buffer, today was going to be hell.



Damn it, why today of all days? My body feels like it’s burning up.



Three hours into my shift, a familiar voice cut through the café’s noise.



“Hey, girl! Miss me?”



Julian appeared at the counter, looking like he’d stepped off a fashion shoot—black pants, loose shirt, denim jacket, rings glinting on his fingers, dark hair artfully messy.



“I thought you were sick?” I whispered, a wave of relief washing over me.



“Sick? No way. I texted I’d be late, and Cooper marked me absent all day. Typical.” He leaned over the counter, then froze, eyes widening. “Girl, you look… off today.”



I avoided his gaze. “I’m fine.”



“The adult ceremony’s coming up. You ready?” His voice dropped to a concerned whisper. “Tomorrow’s your eighteenth, right?”



“Can we not talk about this here?” I hissed, nervously scanning the room.



Worry flickered in his eyes. “Your reactions are stronger than any pre-ceremony Omega I’ve seen.”



Before I could respond, I messed up two coffee orders, handing a cinnamon latte to a customer who’d asked for vanilla.



“What the fuck is this shit?” The male werewolf customer roared, shoving the cup toward me. “I ordered vanilla, not this cinnamon garbage!”



“I’m so sorry, sir. I’ll remake it right away.” I reached for the cup, my voice shaking.



His nostrils flared, a malicious smirk curling his lips. “This is what you get letting lowlife Omegas serve customers. Can’t even handle a simple coffee order. Pathetic.”



My cheeks burned as other customers turned to watch.



He kept going, his tone dripping with contempt. “An Omega like you won’t even snag a halfway decent fated mate. Maybe you should come to me—at least you’d get a taste of what a real wolf feels like.”



Julian stepped between us. “Sir, I’ll remake your drink now. And I’d appreciate it if you kept your comments about my coworker to yourself.”



Under Julian’s steady stare, the customer scoffed but backed off.



“This is unacceptable, Isabella.” Ms. Cooper appeared out of nowhere, her lips pursed into a thin line. “You’ve been distracted all week, and now you’re causing a scene with a customer.”



“He was inappropriate—”



“I don’t care. Fix your attitude, or don’t bother coming in tomorrow.” She lowered her voice. “And handle your… condition. You’re affecting others in your state.”



Shame scorched hotter than the fire in my veins. I wished the ground would split open and swallow me.



“You okay? That guy was a complete asshole,” Julian said later, as we stood outside after my shift.



“I’m fine, just tired.” I lied, adjusting my backpack for my second job.



“Fuck, girl. You need to figure this out, especially working at Night Howl. The wolves there aren’t as easy to deal with as here.”



“I’ll manage. I’m heading home.” I turned, exhaustion slowing my steps.



“Text me if you need anything, okay?” Julian called after me.



I nodded without looking back. My skin felt like it was crawling with a thousand needles, and the throbbing between my legs had only grown worse throughout the day.



This is my problem. I’ll deal with it.



I took a back route home, paranoid about crossing paths with wolves who might pick up on my condition. Damn, if any wolf catches my scent right now… Look at me—pussy drenched, tits so sensitive it hurts, ready to act like a bitch in heat the second a male wolf walks by.



My apartment building’s elevator was broken again, forcing me to climb five flights of stairs. By the time I reached my door, my legs were trembling from exhaustion and something entirely different.



Inside, I collapsed onto the bed, noticing something in my pocket—a glossy black card I didn’t recall picking up. It bore a silver moon emblem and elegant lettering:



Erotic Haven – Exclusive Experiences for Werewolves Open to Unbonded Omegas .This Saturday, No Invitation Required



Who gave me this? What is this place? It sounds like some high-end wolf club, the kind where a lowlife Omega like me wouldn’t even get past the door.



I flipped the card in my hand, feeling an inexplicable pull toward it. My body ached with an unbearable emptiness. My hand slipped between my thighs, but my own touch wasn’t enough.



The void was suffocating, a physical pain throbbing with every heartbeat. Damn this coming-of-age bullshit.



Drifting between sleep and waking, my mind conjured images of powerful male wolves, their scents enveloping me, their mate bonds soothing the searing need inside. I could almost feel their hands roaming my body, their teeth grazing my neck, their hard cocks filling my emptiness.



Maybe Erotic Haven could offer the answers my wolf instincts were howling for. Maybe Saturday—tomorrow night—I’d go find out.



# Chapter 2



Isabella



I stood before the grand entrance of Erotic Paradise, my heart hammering against my ribs, clutching the mysterious black card like a lifeline. In the moonlight, the smooth obsidian doors gleamed, the silver wolf totem carved into them seeming to watch me with scrutinizing eyes.



What am I doing here? This place is for the elite, not for a low-ranking Omega from the Forest Domain like me. But what if... what if my destined mate is inside? What if the burning inside me is calling to someone?



I smoothed down my simple black dress—the only decent thing in my wardrobe—trying to ignore the trembling in my fingertips. Every instinct screamed for me to turn and flee back to my shabby apartment, but the burning need within me had only intensified as the day progressed.



Tonight was my eighteenth birthday, the night of my coming-of-age ceremony, and my body was betraying me in ways I couldn't comprehend.



""Identification,"" the expressionless doorman demanded, his nostrils flaring slightly, catching my scent.



I fumbled in my bag, producing my Silver Moon University student ID. ""Here.""



He checked it briefly. ""Do you have an Alpha invitation? Tonight is open for unbonded Omegas.""



""I'm an Omega,"" I said, my voice embarrassingly small. ""I'm not bonded to anyone.""



His eyes narrowed. ""I need to verify your scent.""



The doorman released an exploratory aura, and my body immediately responded—my spine arching slightly, head tilting, exposing my neck. Damn it. The textbook Omega submission posture I'd sworn not to display.



His expression shifted almost imperceptibly. ""Your scent... you're approaching your ceremony night, aren't you?""



I nodded, heat rising to my face.



""Very well. You may enter."" He stepped aside, opening the doors to a world I'd only heard about in whispers.



Just another security check. Part of the wolf pack secrecy oath. There's nothing special about me. But maybe... maybe the mate my body is calling for is waiting behind these doors.



The threshold felt symbolic—stepping from my mundane world of textbooks and minimum wage into a realm of primal power. The air inside was thick with the pheromones of elite werewolves, making me dizzy, my core clenching.



Don't look down. Don't clasp your hands together. Don't act like a typical submissive Omega. Is that even possible?



At the reception desk sat a beautiful brunette, her nameplate reading ""Diana."" Her gaze swept over me, barely concealing her disdain, her nose wrinkling slightly as if she'd smelled something unpleasant.



""Welcome to Erotic Paradise,"" she said, her voice dripping with false sweetness.



""Hello,"" I managed, hating how my voice trembled. ""I heard tonight was open for unbonded Omegas?""



""Yes, that's correct."" Diana's perfectly manicured nails hit the keyboard with unnecessary force. ""I need to register you and introduce you to tonight's pack counselor. She'll explain our club rules and answer any questions you might have."" Her eyes narrowed. ""I also need to verify you don't have another werewolf's mate bond on you. You understand.""



The way she spoke made me feel like something scraped from the bottom of her designer shoes. Her eyes never quite met mine, always looking slightly over or through me, as if acknowledging my existence was beneath her.



She led me down a corridor decorated with ancient pack emblems and vivid paintings of wild moon nights. With each step, the male energy in the air grew stronger, making my knees weak and my skin hot. The wolf inside me stirred restlessly beneath my skin.



Fuck, my body is on fire. Should I really be here? I'm already going into heat. Why don't other Omegas react this way? Why only me?



At the end of the hallway stood a massive door emblazoned with a silver moon and wolf head. Diana knocked twice, then pushed it open, leading me inside.



The room was dimly lit, and I immediately felt surrounded by the powerful Alpha auras that permeated the air. I had to concentrate to remain standing.



""Violet, I've brought a new Omega. Can you explain the club rules to her?"" Diana's tone made it clear she considered the task beneath her station. She practically spat the word ""Omega"" from the tip of her tongue, as if it tasted bitter.



A woman dressed entirely in leather—knee-high boots, a corset, and what looked like leather gloves—turned and smiled warmly at me. Her welcoming expression was a stark contrast to Diana's cold demeanor.



""Of course, Diana. I'll take good care of our little wolf girl,"" Violet replied, her voice gentle but with enough authority to make Diana stiffen slightly.



Diana flicked her hair dismissively and left, leaving me alone with Violet. I watched her go, confused by her open hostility. Most werewolves at least pretended to be polite.



""Hello, little wolf. What's your name?"" Violet asked, her eyes crinkling with genuine warmth.



""Isabella, ma'am?"" It came out as a question.



""In the pack, you can call me Violet directly."" Her smile was genuine, making me relax slightly. She gestured for me to sit in a comfortable chair, treating me with the respect Diana hadn't bothered to show. ""Is this your first experience with mate bonding?""



""Yes,"" I admitted. ""I've been wanting to learn more about mate bonds, especially since today is my eighteenth birthday ceremony.""



Violet nodded understandingly. ""It's normal to feel nervous about your first exposure to high-ranking packs. It takes courage to step outside your low-ranking pack territory. Some Omegas bring friends or family along to have company during their exploration.""



""I don't..."" I hesitated. ""I don't really talk about my changes with my parents, and I don't have close werewolf friends in Silver Moon City, except for Julian, but he's gay.""



""I see."" Violet's gaze softened. Where Diana had looked through me, Violet truly saw me—not just an Omega classification, but a person. ""Well, you've come to the right place. Tonight could be very special for you."" She gestured for me to follow her. ""Let me show you around and explain how things work here.""



Something told me tonight would change everything—I just didn't know how much.



# Chapter 3



Isabella



Violet led me deep into the erotic paradise, away from Diana's cold reception and into the heart of the club. Silver-blue lights bathed the corridors, creating a dreamlike glow that mimicked moonlight. Ancient wolf totems decorated the walls, their carved eyes seeming to track our every movement.



This place feels ancient and powerful... like it was built on sacred ground for creatures like us.



My skin tingled beneath my dress, unusually sensitive to every touch of fabric. Tonight—my eighteenth birthday—my wolf would finally manifest. I could almost feel her stirring within me, responding to the pure wolf energy that permeated this environment.



""The lighting is designed to mimic the energy of the moon,"" Violet explained. ""Many find it calming, though some newly matured wolves might find it...



stimulating.""



We rounded a corner, and I suddenly froze. In the center of a circular area, a female werewolf knelt on a platform covered in black velvet, her hands gently bound behind her back with delicate silver chains. Her posture was elegant and submissive, with a collar of moonstone around her neck that shimmered slightly.



A male werewolf stood before her, holding a slender leather whip, moving slowly and precisely across her shoulders, leaving faint red marks. Her body trembled slightly with each touch, her breathing rapid yet accompanied by a satisfied low moan, faint wolf markings appearing on her skin, visible yet ethereal in the artificial moonlight.



God, this scene has ignited something within me like a flame.



""This is a ritual of trust and control,"" Violet whispered, noticing my gaze. ""They explore each other's boundaries this way. Her markings indicate she's accepting his energy, but this is just the beginning—true connection requires time and understanding.""



I swallowed hard, unable to look away, the primal tension making my heart race.



""I forgot to ask—have you learned about these things?"" Violet asked gently.



""I... I've seen clips online,"" I admitted, my cheeks burning.



We continued walking, my thoughts thrown into chaos by the scene, feeling both dangerous and strangely alluring. My omega nature was stirring, despite my attempts to suppress it.



In another area, a female werewolf was suspended from a low silver frame, her hands secured above her head with soft leather restraints, her toes barely touching the ground. Her body leaned slightly forward, her bare back exposed to the moonlight, skin smooth as silk. A male werewolf moved around her, holding a lit white candle, slowly tilting it to let drops of melted wax fall onto her shoulder blades.



She emitted soft moans as each drop of wax solidified on her skin, forming crystalline teardrops. Her blindfold, embroidered with intricate crescent patterns, blocked her vision but heightened her sensitivity to each touch, her body arching involuntarily, the scent of arousal permeating the air.



My lower body tightened, as if gripped by an invisible hand. What is happening to me?



""I wouldn't recommend any newly matured werewolf jump into such intense rituals,"" Violet advised. ""Starting with simple contact and gradually adapting to each other's rhythm works better.""



I shifted uncomfortably, feeling wetness between my thighs, shame and desire intertwined.



""Blindfolding amplifies the senses,"" Violet continued. ""Every touch, every scent becomes more intense. You can never predict what will happen next, and your body responds involuntarily.""



My body is already unbearably sensitive—even the wind against my skirt feels like a caress.



""We can go to the Moonlight Bar anytime,"" Violet suggested. ""I remember how fast my heart was beating the first time I saw these rituals, so there's no rush.""



""It's fine, we can continue,"" I said, my voice tense.



We passed through more corridors, each showcasing new aspects of werewolf intimacy that both terrified and fascinated me.



""These crescent-shaped archways lead to private bonding rooms,"" Violet explained, pointing to doorways carved into new moon shapes. ""For those who prefer privacy. We also have special moonlight observation rooms where you can watch rituals through moon crystals. No one can sense your presence, but you can observe their bonding process. Very educational for newly matured werewolves.""



As we walked, my temperature continued to rise, the wolf within becoming clearer with each step. By the time we reached the Moonlight Bar, I felt dizzy from sensory overload.



""Want to see something more... intense?"" Violet's voice carried a hint of teasing, as if she saw through my discomfort.



I swallowed hard and nodded, despite the voice in my head screaming for me to run. She led me away from the bar, through a dimly lit corridor, stopping at a half-open room. Inside, a female werewolf knelt on a floor covered with a black fur rug, her hands tied behind her back with fine rope, the knots as intricate as artwork.



Her skin glowed faintly under the moonlight lamps, a collar of obsidian around her neck, a black silk ribbon blindfolding her eyes as she lay on a leather chaise, legs spread. A male werewolf stood beside her, holding a feather, gently tracing it across her labia. She trembled, releasing a low moan that seemed both painful and satisfied.



My heart pounded like a drum, that feather seeming to trace across my own skin.



""This is a game of the senses,"" Violet whispered. ""The ropes keep her immobile, while the feather brings every inch of her skin to life. Have you ever experienced this? Completely letting go, allowing someone else to control your responses?""



I shook my head, my throat too dry for words. I had never imagined these things—control, submission, sensory extremes—but now my mind was picturing myself bound, shame and desire washing over me like a tide.



""It's frightening at first,"" she continued, her tone as gentle as if sharing a secret, ""but if your partner understands you, understands your boundaries, that trust... makes you feel like you're flying. Do you think you could try? Or would you rather hold the rope?""



""I... I don't know,"" I whispered, my face burning, ""This is... too complex.""



She laughed softly: ""That's okay. Everyone feels overwhelmed the first time they see these things. Your reactions tonight have already been brave.""

[Why we need critical minerals for the energy transition | World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/05/critical-minerals-energy-transition-supply-chain-challenges/)

* **Critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements are fundamental to technologies such as electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels, making them indispensable for the global shift towards sustainable energy.​**
* **The concentration of mineral production and refining in specific countries, coupled with long lead times for developing new mines, poses significant risks to supply chains.**
* **A white paper from the World Economic Forum and McKinsey,** [***Securing Minerals for the Energy Transition***](https://www.weforum.org/publications/securing-minerals-for-the-energy-transition-unlocking-the-value-chain-through-policy-investment-and-innovation/)**, maps out the key steps required to manage demand, boost availability and shore up supply chains.**

The transition to cleaner energy has put the spotlight on critical minerals and rare earth elements. These are essential for producing the carbon-free and low-carbon technologies that will enable us to move from fossil fuels to more sustainable alternatives. Critical minerals are in anything from battery storage and electric cars to wind turbines and solar panels, to name a few.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that demand for critical minerals will need to [triple by 2030 and quadruple by 2040](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/industry/critical-minerals) if we are to achieve net-zero emissions.

The hitch is that some of these minerals are very rare and currently concentrated in specific areas of the world, especially in China. Increasing demand, volatile prices, supply chain and geopolitical issues have put critical minerals and their rare earth cousins[ on political agendas the world over](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ee01701d-1d5c-4ba8-9df6-abeeac9de99a/GlobalCriticalMineralsOutlook2024.pdf).

For example, the [US government has just fast-tracked the permission](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/trump-fast-track-permitting-10-mining-projects-across-us-2025-04-18/)s process for 10 mining projects in a push to boost critical minerals production at home. Similarly, [the EU has struck 14 strategic partnerships ](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/23/critical-raw-materials-set-to-be-a-key-lever-in-global-trade-war)with potential suppliers since 2021, including Canada and Ukraine, the latter before the start of the war.

# What are the key critical minerals, and where do they come from?

# What are critical minerals, and why are they important?

Although definitions vary, there are a large number of critical minerals and rare earth elements that are important to the energy transition. Sometimes they are referred to as “critical materials”, extending to metals like aluminium and other substances.

The US Department of Energy lists a total of [50 critical minerals](https://www.energy.gov/cmm/what-are-critical-materials-and-critical-minerals), while the [European Union focuses on 34](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/raw-materials/areas-specific-interest/critical-raw-materials_en). The IEA’s list of the most widely used ones [includes lithium, nickel, cobalt manganese and graphite](https://www.iea.org/topics/critical-minerals), which are typically used in batteries. Aluminium and copper are vital for electricity networks, and rare earths are used for magnets in wind turbines and electric car motors.

Some, like platinum, iridium and palladium are among the rarest elements on Earth, while others like aluminium and silicon, are among the most abundant elements on Earth.

However,[ just because they are abundant does not mean they are easy to access](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2024/Oct/IRENA_Ranking_critical_materials_for_the_energy-transition_2024.pdf). For example, while copper is not a rare element, the typical lead time for a new mine to start delivering copper to the market is about 20 years, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

https://preview.redd.it/k8x9fenp7j0f1.png?width=2860&format=png&auto=webp&s=293f5c8b8aa5b08e54bbe50b72b1c617c19a4fa5

That’s why recycling will be a vital requirement for ensuring enough of those critical resources are available. The more of a material can be recycled, the less rare it is going to become. What is more, recycling will reduce the need to extract more and more from the ground.

**However, IRENA has pointed out that as demand for critical minerals and materials has increased rapidly, current recycling technology and infrastructure are still lagging. Until recycling can play a bigger role, we still depend heavily on traditional extraction and the associated value chain. The question of where we source critical minerals therefore remains vital for securing future supply chains as demand grows.**

# Geneva trade deal may accelerate Chinese mineral flows to American manufacturers.

The breakthrough trade pact between the world's two largest economies has de-escalated trade war tensions and is expected to make it easier for American manufacturers to receive a long list of Chinese-produced minerals critical to the automotive, defense, energy, and high-tech sectors.

Chinese and American officials came out of marathon trade negotiations in Geneva over the weekend with a 90-day trade war truce that includes an unexpectedly large reduction in tariffs and a recognition of ""the importance of a sustainable, long-term, and mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship,"" according to a joint statement.

While critical minerals were not mentioned as a headline topic of the pact, industry experts expect that a cooling of trade tensions over the next three months will result in speeding the flow of these elements of innovation.

""We are expecting to see an acceleration in the issuance of the required export license and exporters with clients in the U.S. might get a license soon,"" an industry insider who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitivities of critical minerals in China told Reuters.

However, Beijing is unlikely to fully dismantle its critical mineral export restrictions, as these remain one of the country's most potent tools in ongoing economic and geopolitical negotiations.

# Critical minerals leverage

While Beijing has been willing to go toe-to-toe with Washington on tariffs, the communist government has also wielded critical minerals as a weapon in a trade and tech war with both Presidents Trump and Biden.

Rare earth elements, gallium, graphite, and antimony are just a few on a long list of minerals critical to America's economy and security that China controls the global supply of.

Over the past three years, Beijing has been expanding a list of critical minerals that require state authorization before being exported out of the country – providing government officials final say on the quantities of critical minerals that can be exported and to whom they can be shipped. The Chinese government has even gone as far as to completely ban certain critical mineral exports to the U.S. in response to what it considered unfair trade policies.

Last December, just one day after the Biden White House blacklisted 140 Chinese-owned companies from receiving computer chipmaking equipment and related technologies, Beijing banned the exports of antimony, gallium, and germanium to the U.S.

In a similar response to Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, the Chinese government [restricted the exports of seven rare earth elements](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/04/09/tech-metals/chinas-heavy-rare-earths-tariff-gambit/2217.html) vital to aerospace, auto manufacturing, nuclear energy, and advanced weapons systems.

The 90-day cooling-off period following the US-China trade deal is expected to ease the flow of critical minerals from China, though the requirement for export licenses is unlikely to disappear – Beijing's control over the supply of these elements critical to the 21st-century economy remains too strategic to relinquish.

1kljf67,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kljf67,This coffee table is the first thing I've built we put in the house! Project #3,"I finally got the motivation and courage to build something that would go in the house. 

Stability-wise, it came together really well. While not shown in the picture where the table is being built, there are braces inside the ring the legs are in, as well as near the bottoms of the legs.

While it is sturdy, I don't really know if I had the best approach to making it so. I kind of just figured out how to make a pocket hole so I went a little overboard with it and used that basically everywhere on this project. I don't have a jig for it either so sometimes it got a little off or a bit too deep.

One thing I didn't do after getting it pieced together was fill up the holes, which while it's not the biggest deal in overall appearance, it does feel a bit half-assed. Sure, most people won't ever see it, but I just felt like it would have been a best-practice kind of thing to do.

The only thing I still want to do to this table is give it a better finish, especially on the top. I wasn't too sure what to do with it after staining so I just put tung oil finish on it. Unfortunately, in the end, the stain nor the finish really gave me the look I was hoping for. That is no fault of the stain or finish, I just need to do more research on those things to figure out what I need to do next time.

All that said this project was a great success because most importantly of all, my wife likes it :)",20,1747135412.0,woodworking,3,0.95,False

I mentioned I was going to do this next weekend but I just couldn’t put it off any longer and took the pills yesterday and I’m happy that I did. 

I took Mife on Sunday at 2:30 pm after having some food, throughout the next 24 hours I only experienced mild cramping and nausea (however I was already experiencing this beforehand) 

Monday at 2:30 I took anti sickness tablets. 

3pm I took 4 200mg ibuprofen, as recommended in my booklet. 

3:30 I inserted 4 miso pills vaginally, got my hot water bottle, lay on the couch with a film on and was in and out of sleep up until 5:30. 

Until 7pm I had only experienced cramping, no sickness, no intense pain. I was convinced I needed to take the other 2 at half 7 as nothing was happening. 

7:10 I felt almost like a “pop” and knew I had to go the toilet immediately, as soon as I did I passed a few large clots, cramping and had a little bit of nausea. I sat there for about ten minutes, instantly felt better. 

By 8pm I had been to the toilet twice, passing more clots, these were slightly smaller (still somewhat large for clots) and I had more of them with a lot of blood passing. The only pain I felt was some intense cramping right before it happened which went away as soon as they passed. The pain felt just like an intense cramp when I’m on my period, but nothing more. 

I went to bed at 10:30, a couple of trips inbetween but with no more clots. No more nausea. 

I woke up at 1am in a bit of pain, toilet again and some more blood, not too much on my pad either. I took one more 200mg ibuprofen and went back to sleep about 40 minutes later. 

I woke up at 7:30 am, no morning sickness at all, I could eat my breakfast and drink my coffee and actually enjoy it. I felt a glimpse of myself again. 

Throughout today I’ve just had the occasional bleed, mostly when I go to the toilet but I have been taking it easy today. 

Basically, all I have to say is I was so worked up and worried, I spent so much time here feeling reassured then scared back and forth, reading other people’s stories I just wanted to add mine because it really can be that pain free for some people. Once it’s over, you start to feel like yourself again immediately. I highly recommend a hot water bottle, anti sickness meds (I used travel sickness over the counter) and liquid capsules ibuprofen. I really believe those helped. If you can, have someone by your side to help you out but if you don’t, I totally believe you can do this yourself! You know your body better than anyone else, listen to it, breathe through it, stay hydrated and treat yourself with kindness.

I use scale to measure the extraction and turn off before the limit hits. I use 14grams of coffee and use instacupa portable grinder. I know it’s not that good of grinder but cant buy a new grinder for now. Since it has pressurised portafilter i removed the mesh from the portafilter to make it less frothy.

This year I moved to another state with my bf mostly so he could pursue a career in a niche industry where the course is only supported in a couple states in the country. I am currently about 6 months away from graduating from my Degree in Nursing and thought moving to a bigger city with him would allow me to support him and have better opportunities for my career to work in bigger hospitals with more funding once I graduate. Since moving in January this year, I have been short on money which my bf was aware of and understanding of at the time and offered to pay the first couple months of our rent and bond. This turned out to be quite a bit of money and it took me longer than expected to get a job due to the job market being kind of crazy right now.  I have since gotten on my feet and have a job and am paying the bills as of the last 3 months and am working on navigating this as I’ve never lived out of home before. My bf was a full time chef for the last 3 years where he earned more than double my salary as I’ve been studying since fresh out of high school. Given this dynamic, he has always been the one to pay for our date nights and things like that. He was well aware when we moved that I had some money saved but not a lot to support me for an extended period of time. After furnishing our apartment and getting essentials, He ended up being the one to pay for our rent from January- March. I’m beyond grateful for this and plan to pay him back once I am earning enough to pay bills and live a comfortable enough life. He was also grateful that I made the move to another state with him as he understood if it weren’t for him I probably wouldn’t have done it but it turned out to be a great opportunity for me too. I ended up having to take this semester off studying as I had problems transferring my credits across to another university but am going back to studies in July and am expected to accelerate my course and finish by the end of January 2026. This means that I’ll have a secure full time job and earning more than double what i currently am. I suggested if he could wait until then as there is 6 months left in the year and next year he will be an apprentice and i will be able to do the same and support him when he’s short on money. However, Given his initial understanding with this situation he has gotten very petty about me owing him money and expects me to dish out every last cent of my paychecks to him after rent and bills. I said that given i don’t have too much left over and am currently looking for a second job, it would put me In a difficult situation and I wouldn’t be able to spend any of my own money I earn for the rest of the year essentially. He asks to see my bank account and my payslips and gets frustrated if I buy a coffee or get lunch at work when I forget it at home. I know that i need to pay this money back but i don’t know if i’m wrong for asking that to be next year when im financially stable and even able to support him if he needs. I know this must be frustrating for him but I can’t live with him constantly monitoring my spending until all this money is paid off as i’m still working on getting enough working hours to make do. I’m looking for advice of what to do or if you think i have a bad outlook on this or if im being reasonable because im really not sure. It’s also a lot colder where we are living and I mentioned that I needed to get some winter coats as my current clothes aren’t cutting it in this weather and he made out like this was the least of my problems and i should just be only working to pay rent and pay him back. As of currently I haven’t paid him back anything as i’ve just gotten on my feet and i’m not sure what to do. I feel like i’ve also given up a lot to be with him including moving away from family and friends and having to put off my studies for an entire semester.I also want to say that apart from this money situation he’s a really easy going guy and we have been together for 4 years and I really love him and he’s never acted like this before in wanting to go through any of my private things such as my bank account. I’ve also never been in a position of owing someone more that $50 so I’m not sure how this situation usually goes or how the other person would feel.

1kljbrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/STD/comments/1kljbrm/burning_sensation_in_urethra_and_penis_for_over_a/,Burning sensation in urethra and penis for over a year — still unresolved,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been struggling with a really frustrating issue for about a year and a half now — **a burning sensation in my urethra and my penis**, mostly during and after urination. It’s been seriously affecting my quality of life, especially mentally and sexually, and I’m feeling pretty lost at this point.

# What I’ve been feeling:

* A kind of blockage or pressure at the base of the penis during urination (especially in the morning)
* Burning in the tip of the penis during urination, and lingering for an hour or two afterward
* Some nights, it gets worse before bed and is really uncomfortable



# How it started:

This all began with some mild burning during urination. My first urine test showed elevated white blood cells (WBC), so my doctor thought it might be kidney stones. He told me to drink more water, cut back on coffee, and avoid spicy foods.

The symptoms didn’t go away though. I ended up seeing multiple doctors — each had a different theory. Some thought it might be irritation or even internal damage in the urethra, others suspected prostatitis. I was prescribed several antibiotics over time, including:

* Azithromycin 250 mg
* Ofloxacin 200 mg
* Levofloxacin 500 mg
* Celecoxib 200 mg

Eventually, after more detailed testing, I tested **positive for Mycoplasma genitalium**.

An ultrasound also showed **varicocele**, but the doctor said we should focus on treating the infection first.



# Treatment I got:

An infectious disease specialist prescribed:

* **Doxycycline 100 mg** – for 7 days (morning and evening)
* **Moxifloxacin 400 mg** – for another 7 days

Later on, I was tested again for resistance, and based on that, they changed my meds to:

* **Doxycycline (hyclate) 100 mg** – 7 days
* **Pristinamycin (Pyostacine) 500 mg** – 10 days (8 pills per day total)



Even during and after finishing all of those antibiotics, the burning continued. I contacted the doctor again, and he told me to do another urine culture (which came back negative). But the symptoms were still there.

I went back to the urologist, and he told me sometimes, even after an infection is cleared, inflammation can stick around for a while. He’s now suggesting a **fibroscopy (urethroscopy)** to look deeper.



# Right now:

* I still have a burning sensation when I pee (maybe slightly better, or maybe I’m just used to it)
* I still feel inflammation inside the penis after urinating
* Burning can last 1–2 hours after peeing



# My most recent test results:

* **Mycoplasma genitalium** – negative
* **Chlamydia trachomatis** – negative
* **Gonorrhea** – negative
* **WBC (urine test)** – normal
* **PSA (prostate test)** – normal



# My questions:

* Has anyone else dealt with something like this?
* How long did it take to go away? What finally worked?
* Could the Mycoplasma still be there even though the test is now negative?
* Could this be prostatitis, even though PSA is normal?
* Or maybe something else entirely?

Over the past few months, I’ve been quietly working on something that came from a very personal frustration—going out to grab coffee or meet friends, only to find the place packed and noisy. As someone who values peace and quiet (and also hates wasting time), I started thinking:

*What if we could know how busy a place is before going there?*

That idea turned into **Densiflow**—an app that shows real-time crowd status of cafés, restaurants, and public spots like parks. The goal is simple: help people find the best time and place to go without the guesswork.

I built this for people like me—introverts, remote workers, students, travelers, or anyone who just prefers less crowded spots.

The app is now live on both the **App Store** and **Play Store**, and I’d really appreciate any feedback from this community. If you have a few minutes to check it out and let me know what you think, or what features you'd love to see, that would mean a lot to me.

Not trying to market here—just genuinely want to know:

→ What would make it better?  
→ Any feedback, bugs, or ideas?

1297 WordsJAMES  
  
Pain....  
  
Blinding, shrieking, unholy agony....  
  
Screaming....  
  
My Jade-Eyes screaming....  
  
Blood....  
  
Pain....  
  
Screaming.  
  
My Jade, weeping....  
  
With a gasp, I rear up, blinking into darkness.  
  
A nightmare....  
  
Just a nightmare....  
  
Beside me in the bed, my flame-haired mermaid, safe and sound, sleeps peacefully. Beyond her: Michael, his chest rising and falling in the steady rhythm of sleep.  
  
Everything is fine. Everything is perfectly normal.  
  
But I'm drenched in sweat, my heart hammers behind my ribs and my breathing snatches. The wound in my thigh throbs a slow, heated beat.  
  
And for the first time, the memory surfaces, how I took the wound.  
  
Corby, his gun trained on Charlotte. Michael, flinging himself bodily at the gunman in a desperate bid to prevent the shot. And looking for refuge, finding none, I seize her, shielding her with my body....  
  
Pain....  
  
Shrieking unbearable agony....  
  
..... And a fall into darkness....  
  
Christ!  
  
I check the time; it's hours after midnight; getting late enough almost to be early.  
  
I have no desire to sleep, to risk being dragged back into that nightmare.  
  
Coffee....  
  
Swinging out of bed, I snag a robe and pad downstairs to the kitchen. The renovations are all but complete now and the house is cosy and comfortable. A couple of weeks ago we moved out of the annex we first occupied, but I still haven't grown used to the feeling of 'home' here.  
  
Home....  
  
I understand why Charlotte so yearned for a home of her own. Dispossessed for most of her life, with nothing to call her own, this has been Michael's gift to her, the most precious thing he knew how to give to her. He has put heart and body and soul into it....  
  
.... Not to mention a thumping great mortgage....  
  
.... Which he can barely afford....  
  
But for myself too, it has become home. Divorced so many years ago now, from a marriage which I never understood at the time was so unsuccessful. Only when I met my Jade-Eyes, did I truly understand what it meant to be bonded with another.  
  
And I would do anything for her....  
  
Anything....  
  
In the kitchen, the homely activities of grinding beans, putting the coffeemaker on the hob, calm me....  
  
.... calm me enough that I begin to think clearly about the memory that has just re-emerged. Everyone... Michael... Richard... Beth... has told me how I was injured, that I placed myself in the path of the bullet intended for Charlotte, but it felt like a story or a news report; something that happened to a stranger. A tale from the tv or social media perhaps.  
  
This feels visceral...  
  
Real....  
  
And my stomach clenches at the memory of that searing moment before I lost consciousness.  
  
I squeeze my eyes tight closed, trying to exorcise the thought.  
  
Then the aroma of the coffee invades my nostrils and reality returns.  
  
I take a couple of large gulps of the brew I deliberately made abrasively strong, then, mug in hand, I head outside, inhaling sweet steam as I walk.  
  
The night is an iced hush; early Spring, with the air cold enough to steal my breath into curling clouds, and with the kiss of frost on the ground. But a golden wedge of moon casts over the lake far below, and the water is full of stars.  
  
And slowly, my heart and breathing slow, and I grow still inside.Chapter 1: Her Master's Wedding, Part 1, The Dream",1,1747134910.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

(Continuation from the [previous part](https://www.reddit.com/r/Binah_LoR/comments/1kiipo1/more_philosophy_floor_actually_does/) )

\[Based on Bahar Rumelili’s Conflict Resolution and Ontological Insecurity\]

 

Binah: And you, how long are you planning to hide behind that bookshelves?

Me: Eh? What do you mean, Lady Binah?

(Chesed meekly steps out from behind nearby bookshelves)

Chesed: Sorry, sorry, there was nobody at the entrance so I just let myself in.

Me: H-how long have you been there, Mr. Chesed?

Chesed: You seemed to be in intriguing conversation so I didn’t want to just barge in.

Binah: You had already barged in here.

Chesed: Well, that’s true. Please pardon me for that.

Me: Is there anything we can help you, Sir?

Chesed: Why, of course. (pulls out a coffee pouch from a paperbag he’s holding with beaming face) I’ve just crafted my best artisan blend yet! Let’s taste it together!

Me: (goes pale) W-wow Mr. Chesed, you’re too fearless...

Binah: (sarcastically) Such a feat to have managed doing that for the tenth time this week...

Chesed: Come on... (shakes the pouch teasingly) I’m sure I’ll be making the Yuenyeung\* right this time\~

\[\*drink made by mixing coffee and tea, popular in irl Hong Kong\]

Binah: (furrows eyebrows) And yet, you persist in provoking me with that abomination, fully aware it only deepens my disdain.

Me: Mr. Chesed already runs off to the kitchen and said we can wait at your usual tea table, Lady Binah.

Binah: (suppressed heavy sigh)

 

(many minutes later at the tea table)

Chesed: …now we add equal part of the concentrated tea.

Binah: …1:2 ratio or the deal’s off.

Me: Lady Binah ends up getting carried away making it too, Mr. Chesed’s charisma sure is frightening...

Chesed: (while pouring to our individual cups and sharing them to us) So where were we? Something about the Head is clearly not orchestrating public anxiety for their own gain, right?

Me: (whispering mumble) …Are we seriously doing this over Yuenyeung?

Binah: We just concluded a discussion on why the Head prefers controlled chaos is all.

Chesed: Uh-huh\~so I’ve heard.

Binah: (eyes glints white and grins) ...but it seems our new guest is eager to have something new to say.

Me: (internally) Uwaah... there they go again...

Chesed: Tell me, friend. Do you think the law against our dearest Ms. Director, makes sense?

Me: Uh? What I think about the AI Amandment? Well it doesn’t make sense of course--

Chesed: (keeps his soft smile) And why you think that?

Me: (gets a bit ragebaited) Why? Well I don’t see why they care so much about eliminating one human-like AI—while everything else that’s actually atrocious is allowed to happen freely in the City!

Binah: ...

Me: (notices Binah’s stare) I-I mean—

Binah: (smiles) Don’t mind me, do go on.

Me: (awkward chuckle, scratching the back of my neck) I... ain’t got anything else, actually.

Chesed: (draws something on a scrap of paper) Fascinating law, isn't it? Where do you think the people it tries to govern are placed, here? (showing the drawing to us)

https://preview.redd.it/w9ran07m8j0f1.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=0206051a38a4068f74a9601346129fc4e54794a3

Me: Whoa... what is this? Is this sociology stuff?

Binah: I see... so that’s the thread you’ve chosen to pull.

Chesed: Well? Which one?

Me: (slurping my cup of Yuenyeung) Ah? Uh, since we already concluded it’s something of a controlled chaos, I think the... stable conflict one?

Chesed: When fear is high but anxiety low, societies can survive stable conflict—the enemy is known, ritualized, managed. But when anxiety spikes, even familiar tensions spiral into unstable conflict.

Me: (The drink is better than I expected, so I continue drinking bottoms up) Oh... (short pause) Wait, are you saying that if AIs are allowed to be, they would increase the City’s anxiety? How come?

Chesed: (slurps the still comfortably hot Yuenyeung) Remember that it’s not about that she’s AI, but AI that can feel emotions.

Me: What could possibly be so dangerous about her having emotions?

Binah: Child, in a world where fending for oneself is the rule, tell me—do you think anyone escapes the responsibility of their sin?

Me: Huh? Why bringing it up now?

Chesed: To maintain anxiety this low in fear this high... how do you think they do it? Who the citizen thinks their enemy is?

Me: W-what do you mean? It’s each other, right—ah!

Chesed: They only fight people just like them. Other citizens, rival syndicates, fellow fixers… it's always someone who still plays by the same rules. Still part of the City. The enemy is familiar.

Binah: If people can produce sentinent AIs to fight and make decisions on their behalf, the ontological distance would absolve their sins.

Me: Err... are you saying that people would feel less guilty if what they’re killing each other for isn’t fellow human?

Chesed: It’s less about guilt than narrative about their identity. You see, for most people in the City, the ""Self"" is not just who they are—but what role they play in this ecosystem. Their job, their syndicate, their affiliations… these all form a coherent identity.

The ""Other Self"" is someone outside their circle, yet still within the same system—different, but not alien. They may wear a different uniform, follow different orders, but they believe in the same structure. Associates fighting another associates is like playing a rival in a brutal game. The pain is real, but the meaning stays intact.

But a true ""Other""—someone who doesn’t follow the rules, who doesn’t share the same symbols or values—forces people to question what the game even is. What they are. That’s when anxiety rises… not from the threat to their body, but from the unraveling of their place in the story.

Me: You mean sentient AI would be the “Other” in that case? But why would that be bad, though? Especially since they would work for people who create them.

Binah: (Finally takes a very small cautious sip of her Yuenyeung, grimaces a bit before continue talking) Child… Who do you think the City’s “Other” right now?

Me: Eh? We had those?

Binah: Before we had this talk, before you know the existence of Angela and everything, were you completely fine with the Head’s laws? Maybe not specifically the AI amandment, but what did you think they are for in general?

Me: Uh… Well… I had heard speculations from here and there in my neigborhood that they’re meant to keep monsters from the outskirts awa—Hmm…

Binah: And what do you think the difference would be for the monsters as the ‘Other’ and the AIs as such?

Me: Well, for starters the AIs would be living inside the City…

Chesed: Which would increase anxiety, isn’t it?

Me: But—rational people would realize they can be on their side—

Chesed: Which would decrease the fear, isn’t it?

Me: Gah—

Binah: Unstable conflict would lead to systemic collapse, while conflict-in-resolution would dismantle the nonsystemic nature of the City’s ecology. Neither is preferable to the the Head.

Me: Ugh, if anything, it’s my head that hurts from this conversation… Mr. Chesed, you’re supposed to make Lady Binah take a break from confusing conversation, not fueling it! (chuckles)

Chesed: (reciprocates the laughter) Hey, that’s why I brought you the relaxing elixir as compensation.

Binah: That’s right. You were so invested in the dialogue, you let your drink gone cold.

Me: Oh I still haven’t finished it? (I sit back down and take the cup to drink the rest, only to realize it’s still basically full) ...Wait.

Chesed: Oh, you’ve actually finished yours, Binah! So I got the blend right this time, didn’t I?

Binah: Yes, so now you can stop coming up here with the excuse of new blend of coffee.

(I smirk silently and chug the now-mine drink, trying to shoo off silly thought of technically indirect kiss.)

“Thanks Luca, you don’t look too bad yourself."" His blonde hair styled perfectly. He had the same blue eyes as her. There was no denying they were siblings. ""Have you snuck a peak downstairs yet?” She asked.

“And risk mom’s wrath? Not a chance.” He replied looking in the mirror while fixing his cuff links on the sleeves of his navy blue suit. “I have though, been checking the group chat and squad seems to think it’s the party of the year.”

“Mom will be so pleased.” Alexia laughed picturing Shelia standing proud.

“I don’t have my phone! Tell me what’s going on!” Alexia pressed.

“Ok! Ok! Hang on. Alpha Eugene’s beta is already drunk. Great. Thomas and Chris are making bets to see which warrior tries to stick their tongue to the ice sculpture. Mom will be thrilled. Ohh and Edmond just walked in and yep all the she wolves are throwing themselves at him per usual.”

Alexia rolled her eyes. ""Tell them put me down for 50 on dad's warrior Tony."" She recalled the time Tony ran around the practice field in heels and dress singing barbie girl for a bet. The man had no shame.

Just then their parents appeared at the door. “Ok my babies it’s about time! Oh! I can’t believe this day is here. Happy Birthday my angels!” Their mom said while hugging them. She fixed Luca's tie and a stray hair of Alexia's then stepped back next to their father

“No father could ask for better children, I am proud of the people you both have come.” The father said as he shook Luca’s hand and kissed Alexia on the cheek. Shelia stood next to her husband nodding in agreement.

Out of the corner of her eye Alexia saw Luca fighting back tears. She smiled. Both of them always wanted to make their father proud, Ecspecially Luca since he will take over the alpha position.

""All right we better get this show on the road, We will go down and then introduce you two so you can make your entrance."" Their mother said as she made her way to the door. She blew them a kiss as she and their father disappeared.

After their parents went back downstairs, Luca and Alexia moved to the staircase to await their discent. She shifted her weight from each foot. ""

“Here we go, head high and shoulders back” Luca said as they heard their names announced and they descended the staircase into the waiting party below.

Luca and Alexia made their way over to their group after being stopped by many well-wishers. Alpha Jacob welcomed everyone and the band began to play. By the time they made it to the squad most of the guests were on the dance or talking amongst the selves.

“Happy Birthday!” the squad sang together.

“Thank you, Thank you” the twins smiled and said.

Alexia’s eyes caught Edmond’s. Nothing. No spark. Not her mate. She could have sworn she saw a hint of sadness in them. But then he smiled grabbing a bottle of champagne and glasses and said “A toast to the birthday boy and girl! Finally the youngest of us is finally legal!” Causing the group to all cheer.

Alpha Jacob cut in then, ""Edmund"" He said sticking his hand out for the prince to shake ""It's been a while, how is the family?""

""Edmund shook his hand with a smile. ""They're great, mom and Caspain send they're regards but are sorry they cannot make it.""

""Oh I'm sure Caspian is surrounded by work to do in the Kingdom."" Jacob said, not at all hurt by their lack of attendance. Bidding a farwell to the group and a reminder to make wise choices, he went to go mingle with the other guests.

""I will claim the first dance with the birthday girl"" Edmund declared. ""I better watch my back now or your fans my try to shank me"" Alexia said with smile on her face. They all laughed and began to dance. When it was time to cut the cake both siblings were tempted to push the other’s face into it but the look their mother was giving them made them think better.

By the end of the night the squad ended up by a lake near the pack house with bottles of champagne and food they had swiped before coming outside. The boys ties were undone and the girls shoes long abandoned. The sky was turning light blue as dawn approached.

They told jokes and stories, laughing the entire time. It was Chris who said “So, neither of you found you’re mates?” Hazel elbowed him ""You Idiot"" Hazel said through gritted teeth. ""I know you're right but why?"" he said shocked and confused.

“No” Luca replied with a look of wondering in his eyes.

“Well, that means we're still on for the annual squad weekend at the palace next week.” Chris said confidently.

Edmond laughed “Mom looks forward to the squad coming to visit since she likes having the house full, especially since dad died.”

“Well Judy does make the best cookies” Thomas went on and began to list all his favorite foods to eat at the palace.

""I don't think she appreciated it when you boys got drunk and slid down the staircase in laundry baskets knocking over a priceless vase."" Alexia said eyeing the boys.

""No she did not"" Thomas responded, grimacing at the memory. ""She made us run laps around the palace till we puked and then made us clean up our puke. T'was not a good day""

They’ve always hung out at the palace a lot since it was harder for Edmund to get away. It was also a mid way point between all their packs. ""How are royal duties?"" Alexia asked Edmund. ""Boring. Absolutely Boring. But it helps Caspian and he is always busy. So I will solve problems between busy body she wolves and cry baby alphas."" He responded.

“Don’t forget that August 1st we start Leadership training and were all going to be at the palace for three months!” Tabatha said.

“You know all the other young alphas and Lunas are going to hate us right?” Luca said. ""They will go out of their way to try and knock us down.""

“Oh, Most definitely” Christopher replied. The Squad was the strongest of the future Alphas and Lunas which caused the others their age to be very jealous.

“They hate us cause they ain’t us!” Thomas chimed in.

""Grant is going to be there."" Hazel said causing a groan to sweep across the group. Her cousin was arrogant and only caredabout how he looked. He also was not fond of the group and made it his mission to get under their skin.

""Forget them, we stay together and have each other's back."" Luca said as the rest of the group agreed.

Alexia sat in the grass contemplating the upcoming months “How many others will be there?” Alexia asked.

It was Edmund who responded with “At least 100.”

Jeez, Alexia thought, that is a lot of alpha blood in one place.

“Someone is going to get into a fight.” Alexia said

Edmund said in a calm voice “It is not a question of if as to when.”

# Interogation

Alexia groaned as she awoke. She should not have drank so much. Her head felt slightly fuzzy.

Rolling over to check her phone, the bright light caused her squint as if she was starring straight into the sun. The group chat seemed to be in agreement with Thomas swearing off alcohol. Again. That will be the day. Luckily, their werewolf blood should burn through the booze fairly quickly.

After a shower and some much needed coffee Alexia headed out to the training field, Her body already recovered from the previous night's activities. She spotted her dad immediately. His powerful alpha aura acting like a beacon as he watched the warriors train. He would cause others to step back from his because aura was so powerful but to her it was as easy as walking up to a puppy.

She walked up to him “ Good Morning Daddy” she said with a smile.

He turned to her smiling “ Well good morning, I didn’t think I would see you till tomorrow based on how many empty bottles of Champagne the cleaning crew found by the lake this morning.”

She laughed sheepishly “I was hoping to get a light workout in this morning.”

“Well good, if you need any help me know.” He said heading to meet the warriors who finished their first set of training. He added over his shoulder “Love you.”

“Love you too” She said heading towards the trails.

On her way to the trails she spotted Luca. “Going for a jog?” he asked as she came near.

“Yeah, wanna join?” she replied.

“My body says no but my head says I need to so I guess I will” he said with a shrug.

The twins had always trained together since they could walk. Their father knew their was something special about them and he was proven right during their first shift. They were both white wolves. The strongest and most rare wolves. Their great great great grandfather had been a white wolf, an elite warrior. A legend. He had fought in the vampire wars and ultimately helped bring peace to the kingdom. There had not been another white wolf seen since his passing, until the twins. Even then their identity was kept secret. Very few people knew about the twins fur in order to keep them safe.

Their fur made them a target and their father would not risk their safety which is why he worked them so hard. Luca was tall with broad shoulders with his blonde hair and blue eyes he stole the hearts of all the she wolves in the pack. He looked strong and was strong with the cool demeanor to match.

Alexia on the other hand was five feet two inches on a good day. She was petite but had matching blonde hair and blue eyes to Luca. A gift they inherited from their mother. She didn’t look it but was as fierce as any of her father’s warriors.

As they ran, Alexia became lost in her thoughts. Who was her mate? Neither her or her brother had found their mate. Granted they were probably children of alphas from another pack so that’s why they hadn’t found them. The uncertainty made her anxious, unable to focus thinking about different possibilities.

It was until Luca mind linked that she awoke from her thoughts “Do you smell that?” He asked.

She sniffed the air, a pungent smell hitting her nose. “Rogues” she stayed.

They immediately mind linked their father and went into stealth mode. The crept over a hill, hiding behind boulders keeping low to the ground. They observed 20 rogues working as of they were looking for something.

""Anything?"" one of the rogues asked. ""No not a thing"" another responded.

They reported back to their father awaiting his arrival.

“Neither of you fight” he ordered the twins.

“But-“ Luca started to say but was cut off.

“No buts, I don’t want the two of you discovered, at least not yet.” He said. The twins laid low in silent protest, silently observing.

Soon their father arrived and tore through the rogues. The rogues were so surprised most were killed before they knew what hit them. The twins watched the slaughter. When it was over the ran back to the pack house to change and meet their father in the dungeons. He always kept at least one rogue alive to interrogate.

The twins made their way down the stairs of the dungeon where a rogue was being brought in. They tied him to a chair.

“Who are you?” Their father said. No response. “What we’re you doing on my land?” Still no response. The twins leaned against the wall with bored expressions as the interrogation went on for hours. Luca starred at the wall absolutely bored with the lack progress they were making.

“I’m losing my patience and when that happens it will become very painful” alpha Jacob said circling the rogue with a knife in hand.

Alexia observed the rogue. He was caked in dirt and grim. His hair was matted from living in the wilderness and in desperate need of a shower. The was not a finger that she could see that did not have dirty under the nail.

“I will never tell you anything!” The rogue yelled.

“Who do you work for?” The alpha yelled back.

Alexia thought to herself, that they had asked the same question a hundred times already.

Just then the door opened with a warrior bringing in an asortment of tools. Her father selected plyers and started removing the rogue's dirty nails from their beds. Screams sounded throughout the room. Alpha Jacob continued to ask his question and without an answer, another nail was taken.

“You all will be destroyed! Every last one of you will be slaughtered like the pigs you are!” The rogue shouted. Before anyone could react he thrust his chair so quick and so hard he snapped his own neck.

The room was silent. The twins looked to their father.

“I want patrols on alert and ready, this rogue may be crazy but I want us ready just in case.” Alpha Jacob said nodding and then exiting the twins left to carry out the order.",1,1747134533.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Over the past few months, I’ve been quietly working on something that came from a very personal frustration—going out to grab coffee or meet friends, only to find the place packed and noisy. As someone who values peace and quiet (and also hates wasting time), I started thinking:

*What if we could know how busy a place is before going there?*

That idea turned into **Densiflow**—an app that shows real-time crowd status of cafés, restaurants, and public spots like parks. The goal is simple: help people find the best time and place to go without the guesswork.

I built this for people like me—introverts, remote workers, students, travelers, or anyone who just prefers less crowded spots.

The app is now live on both the **App Store** and **Play Store**, and I’d really appreciate any feedback from this community. If you have a few minutes to check it out and let me know what you think, or what features you'd love to see, that would mean a lot to me.

Not trying to market here—just genuinely want to know:

Morgan

I wake up with a smile on my face—yesterday was the best day ever. Last night, I had my Sweet Sixteen party, and Mom had organized it to perfection. I’m not a girly girl, so pink was out of the question. Instead, Mom used a few of my favorite colors: indigo and maroon.

From the tablecloth to the decorations, everything was in indigo and maroon. Only our Pack-members were invited, just like every other year. That’s how it has always been for any party we have—whether it’s for me, the Pack, or one of my six older Brothers. Mom and Dad never invite members of other Packs. It’s an unspoken rule in our pack, one that has been in place for centuries, and I doubt it will change anytime soon.

The best part of my Sweet Sixteen was the gift from my family—a Harley-Davidson Fat Boy, custom-ordered in my favorite colors: black, indigo, and maroon. Even the outfit, helmet, and boots matched—black with indigo and maroon accents.

The jacket fits me like a glove, and the same goes for the pants, both made of a sturdy material—no doubt at Mom’s insistence. My helmet is my favorite next to the bike because Declan made sure our Pack’s crest was airbrushed onto it, using indigo and maroon. A Wolf lying near a water shore.

The boots have a two-inch heel with every possible protection feature, and again, I know Mom was behind it. But I don’t mind at all. Dad made me promise not to ride my bike until Ashton taught me how to ride safely. I had to keep a straight face when I made that promise. If only he knew I’d been riding Ashton’s bike for six months already.

My name is Morgan, and I am the youngest Pup of Alpha Tate and Luna Giselle. Like I mentioned before, I have six older Brothers. Don’t ask me how our parents managed it, but there are exactly two years and one month between each of us. To make it even creepier, we were all born on the first of the month.

We all spent our first year in the same room since Mom wanted the nursery close to their bedroom. But on our first birthday, we each got our own room. Everything was prepared weeks before my Brothers were born—Dad made sure of that.

The day before I was born, Ashton asked Mom why he didn’t have a baby Sister. Mom told him, “We don’t always get what we want.” He then asked her if she wanted a baby girl. She said, “If I get a baby girl tomorrow, I’ll be over the moon.”

Ashton and Dad had laughed their asses off, knowing for a fact that Mom wasn’t pregnant. Mom and Dad had been trying for another Pup ever since Landon was born, and Mom had been devastated when she found out she wasn’t pregnant a few months before that day. After that, she didn’t want to try again.

The next day, just after breakfast, Mom collapsed. Dad rushed her to the infirmary, my Brothers running behind him. From time to time, Dad felt the excruciating pain Mom was going through, and it took hours before our Pack-doctor finally came out to see him.

You can imagine the look on Dad’s face when Doc told him he had a baby girl. Mom panicked because nothing had been prepared for me, but she didn’t have to worry. Everyone in our Pack helped our Beta and Gamma females get everything ready. To this day, Mom still calls me her little miracle.

With Ashton being born in January, you can do the math—I'm a summer Pup, born in July.

So, I am the youngest of seven Pups and the only female, but my Brothers never treated me any differently. I might be Daddy’s little Princess, but I’m not a spoiled brat. Mom and Dad provide us with everything we need, but if we want anything extra, we have to work for it—something we’ve always accepted without argument.

I get out of bed and take a shower. As I wash my hair, I think about what to do today. Dad gave me the day off, figuring I’d sleep in after my party. And while I did wake up later than usual, it’s still early. First thing on my list—breakfast. My stomach rumbles in agreement.

I grab my training outfit from my closet, even though I don’t have training today. I’ll go through my routine on my own, since our Gamma probably isn’t expecting me. As I step out of my room, I realize something—it’s too quiet.

This is usually the time of day when everyone is rushing around. Dad hurrying out the door for his morning meeting, Ashton trailing behind him, and Mom calling after them to be on time for lunch. My other Brothers scrambling to make it to training, with Mom yelling for them to be back on time for lunch. The only one who never rushes anywhere is me.

But today, it’s eerily silent. Even our Omega isn’t in the kitchen. I am glad I can make my own breakfast.

I sit at the kitchen island with my meal and coffee, still wondering why no one is around. After finishing my coffee, I rinse my dishes and place them in the dishwasher before heading downstairs to the training grounds.

Every Pack-member I pass looks a little confused. I have to stifle a smile—looks like everyone thought I’d be sleeping in today.

As I walk down the last flight of stairs, I see that Dad’s office door is closed. He’s probably in his usual morning meeting with his Beta and Gamma. It’s one of the few times during the day when his door is shut. I walk towards the back of the Pack-house—the fastest way to get to the training grounds.

Again, I’m met with confused looks. And now, it’s starting to annoy me. Why is it so strange to see me up and about? Other than my party last night, nothing unusual happened and that means I wake up at a decent hour.

I shrug it off and get to training. The only difference today—our Gamma is a no-show. It doesn’t bother me. By the time I’m done, I’ve worked up a sweat. Grabbing my now-empty water bottle, I head back to the Pack-house. This time, I’m greeted with smiles and “Good morning”s from those I pass.

The door to Dad’s office is closed, and this time I wonder what is going on. Normally, the door would be open by now. As I pass the Beta floor, I hear a lot of commotion, but I ignore it because I am in desperate need of a shower and want to be downstairs in time for lunch.

After my shower, I blow-dry my hair before braiding it. I decide to put on my light blue, high-waisted skinny jeans with an off-the-shoulder black shirt. I grab my boots to go with my outfit and apply a little mascara before heading out of my room. Again, I am met with silence.

I decide to check the kitchen, and when I walk in, I smell that no one has been here since I left. This really worries me because Mom usually comes up here to change before lunch. I walk back toward the bedrooms and I can smell that no one has been here either in the past few hours, which is odd because my Brothers always take a shower after training.

Right now, I wish Dad had initiated me into the Pack yesterday, but I understand why he didn’t—he didn’t want me to have a splitting headache during my party. Still, it would make things easier if I could link Mom or Dad. I’ll find out what’s going on at lunch, and I feel a little better knowing I’ll see my family in a few minutes.

I decide to check my agenda on my way down to the main dining room to see when I have my Mother-Daughter day with Mom, and I nearly lose my footing when I don’t see it scheduled for this week. I go through the agenda for the next three months, but I don’t see any Mother-Daughter days planned.

This is so unlike Mom. She loves our Mother-Daughter days and always plans them ahead. It’s her way of spending time with me, and even though I was reluctant at first, I now look forward to them just as much as she does.

I hear chatter coming from the dining room and slip my phone into my back pocket as I enter the room.

Every conversation halts for a second, but soon the room is filled with chatter again. When I turn toward our table, I notice my family isn’t there yet. I walk over to the buffet, place my favorite foods onto my plate, and grab a cappuccino before heading to my seat.

I smile when I hear Mom’s voice getting closer, but the moment she walks into the dining room, she switches to the mind-link as she looks at our Beta female. It doesn’t take long before I realize that all of them are talking through the mind-link.

Sofia's lips trembled before she clasped the pictures in her hand.  
The menu before her seemed to blur, the words dancing on the paper like elusive shadows. The soft hum of conversation inside the hushed ambiance of the Japanese restaurant enveloped Sofia like a cocoon. For a few minutes, the room felt almost suffocating.  
""Where did you get these?"" she asked, her gaze landing once again on the images of her boyfriend and elder sister together on the balcony of a hotel, kissing each other. A part of her was certain these were photoshopped.  
After all, her sister Charlotte Lockhart had been very good to her, supporting her in everything. Why would she betray her trust? Moreover, Sofia’s boyfriend Daniel Beaumont had been with her for four years. Why would he suddenly betray the trust she gave him? This didn’t make sense.  
""You can check the dates, time, and location behind each photo,"" the man across from her answered. She quickly turned the photos around, and just like he said, the information she was looking for was indeed scribbled behind each image.  
""Mr. Beaumont, you must understand that this information is..."" Her lips trembled as her gaze landed on Mr. Alexander Beaumont, Daniel’s older brother and the current CEO of Beaumont Empire. ""Too much to handle.""  
She felt a tightness in her throat and a drumming in her temples.  
""Having doubts despite all the evidence is normal,"" Alexander’s lips quirked up as he mused. ""I would understand it if you have the photos checked for authenticity."" Amusement flashed in his dark brown eyes.  
She nodded. Again, her eyes landed on the photos. Without saying another word, she placed the photos back in the brown envelope and carefully stowed them inside her bag.  
""Then may I know what Mr. Beaumont wants?"" Sofia said. This made her confused as she had actually only met Mr. Beaumont once, and that was during a Christmas dinner two years ago. Despite being Daniel’s older brother, Alexander Beaumont buried himself in work. This man had been a well-known workaholic who missed his younger brother’s birthday for four consecutive years. Yet, out of nowhere, he would suddenly meet her. Why? Was it simply because he wanted to tell her about the photos?  
Without saying a word, Mr. Beaumont signaled his secretary, who was standing behind him. The secretary then handed another folder to Sofia. She opened it without asking questions. She understood that Mr. Beaumont was a man of few words.  
She quickly read the documents inside the folder, and almost immediately, her expression changed. ""M— Marriage of Convenience?"" She almost could not believe what she was reading. Mr. Beaumont wanted to marry her?  
""Read the rest…""  
Sofia bit her lower lip as her green eyes glazed over the entire document until she finally reached the last part that informed her this was but a temporary arrangement.  
""Mr. Beaumont, I am your brother’s woman,"" she uttered as her heart raced against her chest. What was this man doing?  
""Cheating brother,"" he added.  
""I have yet to confirm this,"" she steadied her voice as she slowly comforted herself. There is still a high chance that Mr. Beaumont was lying and that the images were photoshopped. She convinced herself that this might just be another scheme.  
Again, without saying a word, he pushed what looked like a black card her way. She stared at it and realized it was a hotel key card.  
""What is this?""  
""It would take time to confirm the photos so Mr. Beaumont arranged for you, Miss Lockhart, to confirm the matters with your own eyes. This is the flight that Mr. Beaumont arranged for Miss Lockhart, as well as the accommodation and transportation. You will be checking into the same hotel as Mr. Daniel and Miss Charlotte are staying.""  
Sofia could not contain her emotion as she accepted the things that Mr. Beaumont’s secretary handed. Daniel was currently not in Springfield; he was at a conference in LA. Meanwhile, Charlotte should be somewhere in Texas, wrapping up her taping for her current film.  
""Let us have this conversation again once Miss Lockhart has confirmed everything,"" Mr. Beaumont got up. ""If you want to change a few things in the contract, please feel free to call my personal number.""  
He placed another card on the table between them and then started walking away.  
""Why me?"" she asked as he took his first step away. Mr. Beaumont could marry anyone. Literally, anyone. Yet, he would suddenly choose to propose a marriage of convenience to his younger brother’s girlfriend? Why?  
He turned around, and without an iota of emotion on his face, he stared at her for a few seconds before he said, ""Business.""  
Then he turned around and left the restaurant.  
Once again, her gaze trembled. She wanted to ask more questions, but her mind could not seem to think straight. The next thing Sofia knew, she was already on the first-class flight to LA.  
It was already the dead of night when she arrived at Long Beach Airport. With just her bag, she quickly boarded the transportation that Mr. Beaumont set up for her. At this point, Sofia did not even know what she was doing a thousand miles away from home. A part of her wanted to know the truth. She knew the truth would devastate her, but she had to know what had been going on behind her back.  
Not long after, she arrived at the Ritz and proceeded to check into a suite room that Mr. Beaumont arranged. Apparently, this room is located just next to where Daniel and Charlotte were staying. The weight of uncertainty pressed down on her as she stepped into the lavish suite.  
Sitting on the large King-size bed inside the room, Sofia immediately sent a text to Daniel, asking him about his day. Just as she expected, there was no response even after thirty minutes.  
Unable to stop herself, she got up and got out of her room. Then she turned on the video on her phone and used the hotel key card that Mr. Beaumont gave her earlier to access the room.  
The door seamlessly opened. For a while, Sofia stood in front of the door, wondering what she was doing.  
Then she straightened her back and walked inside the room. She chose not to turn the lights on and instead used a small flashlight that she bought from the airport.  
Quickly, Sofia realized that no one was inside. After a quick tour, Sofia concluded that a couple was inside this room. However, a part of her was still doubtful, hoping that the evidence was all planted, arranged in advance for her.  
The other part was, of course, devastated.  
However, she steeled herself. There was no point in backing down. She came here for the truth, and she was prepared to find out what it was. Just as she thought of checking the luggage stored on the luggage rack, she heard a hiss. Then all the lights inside the room turned on.  
Whoever it was that was occupying this room… just arrived.

Chapter 2  
Sofia's heart raced like a wild horse, pounding against her chest as if trying to escape its bony cage. The closet felt small around her and she quickly closed her eyes.  
Sofia’s trembling hands clutched her phone. The video was on, recording whatever it was that was happening outside of the closet.  
“I told you not to drink,” Charlotte's voice, usually warm and comforting, cut through the stifling silence, a mixture of disappointment and concern lacing her words.  
“What are you so angry about? Didn’t I just come back to the hotel with you?” Daniel's voice followed. His words echoed like distant thunder, each syllable crashing against her senses. In an attempt to stifle a gasp, she covered her mouth with trembling hands, her fingers barely managing to muffle the sound of her disbelief.  
From the small gap in the closet, she could see Charlotte who was trying to remove her clothes.  
“Let me help you,” Daniel quickly helped her pull the zipper down before he moved her long blond hair to the side and kissed her neck while hugging her from behind.  
Sofia was certain she heard her heartbreak. A searing pain gripped her chest, squeezing her heart. This was not a show. This was real. Mr. Beaumont wasn’t lying.  
“Shall we bathe together?” Daniel asked.  
“You smell bad…” Charlotte said she pouted as she batted her beautiful eyes. “I told you not to drink. You know how I dislike that smell. Aw!” Charlotte suddenly screamed when Daniel poked her side. “What— Hey— stop— stop tickling— I am still on my heels! Ah!”  
Out of nowhere, Daniel carried Charlotte into his arms and placed her on the bed. Using his elbow to support his weight, he lay on top of her.  
“Do you still dislike how I smell?” he smirked. Sofia could hear that sweetness in his voice. She closed her eyes in an attempt to block out the rest, but it was useless.  
“Hmph! Stop acting cute. You’re not.”  
“Really?”  
“Really!” Charlotte pouted as she batted her beautiful blue eyes. “And you lied to me. You said we would stay here for a week.”  
“The meeting is only for three days, Sofia would know.”  
“You already spend most of your time with her at home. What’s wrong with spending a few days with me? Aren’t you leaving her soon?”  
Sofia almost dropped her phone when she heard Charlotte’s words. W— What is she talking about? The raw and visceral pain that threatened to consume her seemed to stop.  
It was as if a cold bucket of water was poured into her soul.  
What was Charlotte talking about?  
At one point, she was tempted to barge into their bedroom and confront them. However, she could not do it now. No. She would not do something that might put her in jail.  
She gritted her teeth as she forced herself to listen.  
“She’s to turn 26 very soon,” Daniel chuckled. “You know I cannot leave without you, right?” He started kissing her neck as his other hand started moving on her body, caressing, pinching, stroking.  
“She has yet to promise you that she would give you her shares even if you have yet to marry. How confident are you that she would hand you the shares without conditions attached?” Charlotte asked.  
“Can we stop talking about something irrelevant?” Again, he peppered Charlotte with kisses, causing the latter to giggle.  
“I am getting impatient, Daniel. I have been waiting for two years.”  
Two years?  
Sofia could no longer stop the tears that welled in her eyes. Two years? Daniel and Charlotte had been sleeping for two years? The truth of their betrayal unfurled inside her like a black banner.  
Sofia grabbed her chest. It felt as If a dagger was in her heart, a blunt dagger that was slowly turning, slowly destroying her from the inside.  
“Her birthday’s in a month, babe,” Daniel reminded Charlotte.  
“I know… I just…” Before she could finish her words, Daniel suddenly showed her a velvet box.  
“You— “  
Then, Daniel helped her sit down on the bed.  
“A ring? You— “  
“Will you marry me?” Daniel asked. “Of course, after I get the shares.”  
For a few minutes, Charlotte stared at the ring, her mouth agape. Then tears welled up in her eyes. Without saying a word, she hugged Daniel and pushed him down the bed.  
The next thing that Sofia saw was something that she found very hard to process.  
Tears flowed down her cheeks as she closed her eyes and covered her mouth, afraid that they would hear her sobs. Each moment felt like a succession of merciless blows towards Sofia’s already shattered heart.  
Soon, she felt like a fog had descended in her head. She could no longer remember how she left the room. The next thing she knew, she was already outside of the door. She quickly ran into her own room. The moment she closed her door, the storm within her broke into stifled sobs.  
Betrayal, heartbreak, and the overwhelming sense of loss clung to her as she sat on the carpeted floor, crying.  
The next day arrived with the persistence of the sun as its rays sliced through the room. Sofia stirred on the bed, her eyelids heavy. The memory of the previous night’s torment immediately filled her head.  
“Awake?” a deep voice interrupted her hazy thoughts. She jolted up, her face pale as she looked around and found a familiar man sitting next to her bed.  
Alexander Beaumont.  
He was wearing a black suit, and his hair brushed up, showing his sharp and intimidating features. For a while, his steady dark brown eyes met her green eyes.  
She frowned.  
“Why are you here?” She struggled to move, her head throbbed, and her arms felt weak.  
Damn Hangover, she thought inwardly.  
It took her a while to realize that she was wearing her underwear. She had spent the whole night drinking and crying. In the end, she fell asleep while thinking about taking a shower. She quickly pulled the sheets up to cover her body.  
“Business,” he answered, his gaze serious. “Shall we talk?”

Chapter 3  
“I have yet to make up my mind,” Sofia said, her eyes narrowing her eyes at him. Did he come because of his proposition?  
The enticing aroma of freshly baked croissants wafted through the air, causing her stomach to growl involuntarily.  
She stole a glance at the tempting spread, attempting to feign indifference to both the food and the audible protest of her hungry stomach. It was a futile effort.  
“Is there a need for such pretense?” Alexander's inquiry cut through the air, devoid of sympathy. “Eat your fill. I only came to make sure that you did not murder anyone. My plans would not succeed when you are in prison.”  
Blunt, Sofia acknowledged inwardly, her attention reluctantly shifting from the tantalizing croissants to the man seated across from her. She picked up her fork and began to mechanically spear a piece of brunch, attempting to divert her focus away from Alexander's words.  
“LH Group will hold its annual shareholder’s meeting, and in this meeting, your stepfather will blame you for the mishaps. Not directly, of course.”  
“W— What?” The cup of coffee in her hand trembled, threatening to spill. His words demanded her full attention, taking all the heaviness and headache from her hangover.  
LH Design was the subsidiary of LH Group. Currently, she is the Head Designer of LH Design and its acting CEO. Before she could continue thinking about this, Alexander pushed another document her way. She opened it without asking any more questions.  
“This— “  
“A plagiarism scandal ready to explode,” Alexander interrupted, delivering the revelation with a cool matter-of-factness.  
“I made those designs…” Sofia's voice wavered. How could it be plagiarism? She spent countless nights drawing them, choosing the materials carefully for the upcoming collection.  
He didn’t answer. He studied her appearance, his eyes confident yet something about it contained cruelty that made her uncomfortable.  
“A rich heiress who grew up with a silver spoon against a working woman who struggled to make ends meet. Who do you think the media will believe?” he asked, his voice cutting through her like a sharp knife.  
“What are you trying to say? Why would my father— “  
“Stepfather,” he corrected her.  
Sofia’s lips trembled. She steadied herself. Her mother married her stepfather when she was just two years old. Her biological father died when her mother was pregnant, and the only father that she knew was her stepfather, Lawrence Miles.  
Charlotte was Lawrence’s daughter from his first marriage. She was only a few months older than Sofia. Because of this, the two always treated each other like sisters.  
“You should already know what I was talking about, no?” he asked. This time, Sofia did not answer. She only stared at the document as she thought of what she heard last night.  
Her 26th birthday was coming. This meant that her trust fund and inheritance from her late grandfather would belong to her. Shares, stocks, bonds, properties, and at least three hundred million dollars. The inheritance was something that every Lockhart would get once they came of age.  
However, to get this inheritance, some conditions must be met. She did not tell Daniel about these conditions, as this had been kept a secret by the Lockhart Family. She did not intend to tell him anything about this matter either.  
However, after what she witnessed last night, she was convinced that Daniel knew about the conditions, and that was why he wanted to keep her around despite sleeping with Sofia’s sister.  
“The shares…” she mumbled. There can only be one reason why her stepfather would create a scandal like this. It was to taint her name. He wanted to show the board that the heiress of LH Group is a plagiarizing ass. This would surely affect how they view Sofia.  
“Smart,” he smirked.  
“My father— Lawrence would never do something like this.” She said. However, a part of her already doubted her own words. She grew up with Lawrence, and he treated her like family all this time.  
“Just like how your sister would never betray your trust?” he asked.  
That hurt. Must he add fuel to the fire? She was not sure if he was making fun of her. The funny thing was, that he was only stating facts. She swallowed in response. What happened last night was enough of a wake-up call for Sofia.  
She had been too lenient.  
No. That was not leniency. It was stupidity.  
How did she not notice that Daniel had been cheating on her? How did she not notice that every time Daniel has a conference or a business meeting, Charlotte would magically have a photoshoot or a film too?  
How? Was she truly that stupid?  
She flipped through the document in her hand as if her stomach hadn’t just growled earlier. To her surprise, there were other things included in the document. Again, there were images. However, unlike the images that he gave her earlier, this one was that of her stepfather.  
“This woman…”  
“Lawrence's ex, and Charlotte’s mother, Lianne Ramirez.”  
As far as Sofia knew, Charlotte's mother abandoned her right after giving birth. She left and never came back. Lawrence quickly assumed all the responsibility and became a single father. Was it all a lie?  
She swallowed. Over the years, Sofia started calling Lawrence, father.  
She flipped through the images and soon found something even more concerning. It was Lianne, Lawrence with someone wearing large shades that covered her beautiful face— It was Charlotte!  
So Charlotte was already seeing her biological mother? She turned the card and saw the dates. This was a year ago! Did Charlotte know about Lianne and Lawrence’s relationship since a year ago?  
The next photos answered her questions.  
The images were of three talking and even vacationing in a tropical country.  
“What about my mother?” she mumbled. If Lawrence and Charlotte had been acting like this for a while now then… what about her mother who was currently staying in a medical facility because of some personal issues?  
“Are you seeing everything now?” he asked. Then he leaned forward. “Everything has been planned. It was a deliberate scheme.”  
Sofia opened her mouth; she wanted to argue, perhaps ask for more evidence, but the more she thought about the proof in front of her, the colder she got. In the end, she closed her mouth without saying another word.  
“Unfortunately, I cannot prove that what happened to your mother was deliberate. Whoever did it covered their tracks very well.” Alexander leaned back, a languid smile on his face.  
She nodded. She cannot exactly let him do everything. “So you wanted to marry me to get my shares of Beaumont Empire?” she asked. Alexander Beaumont was a well-known bachelor. There had been rumors of him having various kinds of relationships, but all would disappear in a day or two.  
“It is not a bad deal, isn’t it?” he asked.  
She wet her lips. Daniel wanted to marry her because he wanted her eight percent shares of the Beaumont Empire. Their reasons for marrying were almost the same, except that Alexander was using a rather direct approach.  
“Marrying me would not only devastate Daniel but… would solidify your position as the heiress of LH Group. It’s a win—win."" He said as he reached out to his cup and slowly enjoyed his coffee.  
“A marriage of convenience, huh…” Sofia said.  
“The perfect one,” he responded, the side of his lips quirking up into another smirk.

Chapter 4  
Sofia sank into her personally customized white ornate chair, her attention fixed on the wisps of steam dancing above the coffee resting on the table before her.  
Despite her role as the creative director of a fashion company, Sofia's office radiated simplicity that bordered on plainness. The color scheme was stark—black and white, meticulously organized to maintain a sense of order. It was intentional, reflecting her desire for clarity and focus in her workspace.  
She closed her eyes, exhaustion was gnawing on her soul. In the past two days, she had mostly spent her time crying and being miserable. When is the pain going to ease?  
Suddenly, noisy sounds came out of the laptop. She immediately ran towards her laptop and turned it on. Earlier, with the help of Alexander, she got to know Lawrence and COO of the company arranged a secret meeting. So she managed to slip a small voice recorder on the lapel of Lawrence's coat. It was something that Alexander generously provided to help her make up her mind—something that she found rather abominable yet quite useful.  
He thought it would be quite useful and it seems that he was right.  
""How was it?"" Lawrence asked. At this time, the two were already in the car.  
""Everything has been prepared… I have acquired some sketches."" Mr. Oh said. One could easily hear the chuckle that followed his words. ""And her?"" he asked.  
""Still clueless…"" Lawrence responded. ""Daniel already agreed to propose to her on her birthday. Convincing her not to sign any prenup should be easy for him. When the time comes…"" Lawrence did not continue his words, but Sofia heard a clinking sound on the other side.  
Were they toasting to their future success?  
Sofia's lips trembled inwardly. The sadness that she felt earlier seemed to vanish. What replaced it was pure rage and hatred.  
""You should call Doctor Mulach and tell him to increase the dosage,"" Lawrence's voice echoed inside Sofia’s head like a bell tolling over and over again. ""She cannot wake up now.""  
""Understood…"" Mr. Oh answered. Once again, Sofia heard a chuckle.  
Unable to continue listening to their conversation, Sofia got up and stared at the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows of her office. Doctor Mulach is currently the head doctor in charge of her mother’s well-being. Since Eunice lost consciousness two years ago, Doctor Mulach had been the one in charge of her treatment.  
Sofia had trusted him as he was a well-known doctor both abroad and in the US. Who would have thought that he was harming her very own mother instead of healing her?  
Who would have thought that Sofia would be so stupid to believe everyone around her?  
She clenched her jaw, her gaze narrowed at the cars that she could see from where she was standing. Her heart raced against her chest as she forced herself to calm down. Closing her eyes, Sofia was not able to stop a single tear from falling into her cheeks.  
Indeed. Being betrayed by the people that she trusted the most was worse than being stabbed by an enemy.  
A chuckle escaped her lips as she took her phone and dialed a number.  
""What took you so long?"" Mr. Beaumont’s deep and sexy voice answered just after a ring. Sofia closed her eyes, she then bit her lower lip. Then she said. “Let’s get married.”",1,1747134128.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

**Chapter 1**

“No…please.”

I was suddenly pulled into someone’s embrace from behind, the heat of his body searing through mine.

""Be good,"" the man growled, his voice rough with desire.

The rising temperature and the scorching skin mixed with breaths that were coming too fast, throwing off their rhythm.

My legs slowly climbed around his body, and the resistance in my voice shifted to something far more seductive.

I opened my eyes to the morning light, no longer looking at the man beside me.

What a night.

Quietly, I dressed, covering the marks he’d left on my neck and left the room.

When I returned home, my mother was brewing coffee, eyes bright with expectation.

I heard my own voice, raspy and dry, “Mom, I’ve agreed to reject Ronan, break off the engagement, and become Cassian’s Luna.”

As she nodded in satisfaction, I smiled bitterly.

""Mom... what was in that juice you gave me yesterday?""

Her eyes flashed with panic for a brief moment before she quickly masked it with a facade of calmness.

“It was just juice. What, do you think I would poison you? Ungrateful rat! Don't expect anything from me again!""

I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. “Fine.”

In the midst of her curses, I dragged my heavy feet back to my room.

The tiny 7-square-meter room, with no windows, only a small ventilation shaft, had originally been a storage room.

When I was seven, and had to return pack to attend school, it was converted into my bedroom.

Though the pipe had been sealed, the damp, moldy smell still seeped through the cracks on rainy, gloomy days.

For 18 years, every night, the sound of footsteps from upstairs would wake me.

But today, when I buried myself under the narrow covers, I slept the deepest and most restful sleep I’d ever had.

Because that glass of juice had severed the last of the tenderness I’d once held for this family.

From that moment on, I would expect nothing from them.

Now, I feared nothing.

Zaria had always stolen what was mine—though she lacked for nothing.

It was as if everything that was mine should belong to her.

If it was mine, she would surely lay claim to it.

I loved writing stories, but I could never keep one. However well I hid them, she'd find and shred them overnight.

Dad didn't care. Mom took Zaria's side, scolding me: ""Just scraps of paper! How dare you blame your sister?""

If I spoke twice to any boy, Zaria would parade him before me the next day: ""Meet my boyfriend.""

And then there was Ronan.

His grandmother and mine had been close friends since childhood, and I’d met him when we were young.

So, when we met again in pack training, he treated me kindly.

When we turned 16 and our wolves were awakened, we discovered that we were fated mates.

We mated to each other, and Ronan was my first love.

I cherished the bond we shared.

I didn’t mind when other things were taken away, but Ronan was the only person in the world, aside from my grandmother, who treated me with kindness.

Though Ronan had promised me time and time again that he loved only me, I couldn’t shake the fear when I thought of Zaria and her greedy gaze.

So, except for my grandmother, no one else knew that Ronan and I were fated mates.

A year ago, when my grandmother’s health began to deteriorate, she was worried I would be mistreated after she was gone, so she arranged for Renna to formally bind me and Ronan in marriage.

My grandmother understood me and wanted to make final attempt to protect me.

But the day after the news of my engagement spread, Zaria showed up early at our training ground, demanding Ronan.

When I saw her, a chill ran through my veins, down to my core.

At first, Ronan treated her like a spoiled, somewhat reckless she-wolf.

But three months ago, when I returned home to grab something, I saw Ronan standing outside my house, leaning against the car door.

Zaria came running out of the house and threw herself into his arms.

Ronan lowered his head to kiss her, and didn’t even notice that I was standing not far away.

I instinctively tightened my hand, which lit up my phone screen.

A minute ago, Ronan had just sent me a message:

“Sorry, Nyla, there’s a pack gathering today. I won’t be able to have dinner with you.”

Behind them, Zaria coiled around him like a viper, smirking at me over his shoulder.

**Chapter 2**

I woke up to find it was already past 2 p.m.

Zaria lounged in the living room in a silk slip, malice dripping from her gaze as I emerged.

""How was the old freak? Word is he's so brutal, survivors either get carried out or leave missing limbs. Which are you? Someone like you, who only loves writing horror stories, must have enjoyed it, right?”

She'd mocked my mystery novels for years, calling me twisted.

I paused and instinctively recalled last night’s Alpha.

Broad shoulders, long legs, a narrow waist, and his hands still felt like they had the strength of solid muscle.

But... he didn’t quite match the terrifying, homely old Alpha I had heard of, did he?

Alpha Cassian had been sent to train with other packs since he was a child. They said he was spoiled and had a poor reputation for being eccentric and erratic in his actions.

As the pack’s Alpha, he didn’t care much about pack affairs, usually letting Ronan and the beta handle things, making him a mysterious figure.

After two years back, he'd never even visited Emberwind's packhouse.

Zaria slowly said, “I heard Alpha Cassian is really gross, totally worn out by drink and women, that’s why he stays hidden. Nyla, doesn’t that suit you perfectly?”

“Fine.”

“Zaria, you can have my fiancé. From now on, call me Luna.”

Zaria didn’t see the tears that were almost breaking me, but her face darkened, her teeth clenched in anger as she spat out:

“You’ve got a sharp tongue. Go ahead and serve the old man for the rest of your life! I’m the one who will be Ronan’s Luna, the one who will spend my life with him! Ronan is going to be the Alpha of the pack, not that old man. He doesn’t even care about the pack, so don’t dream about being Luna. Ronan’s dad will make Ronan the pack’s Alpha, not that old man Cassian!”

She continued. ""Once that meddling crone dies, who'll protect you then?""

Zaria could say whatever she wanted to me, but when she insulted my grandmother, I couldn’t just stand there.

I took two steps forward and grabbed a handful of her hair, growling at her, “Don’t you dare insult Grandma!”

Zaria pulled at my shirt collar and screamed, ""She should've died years ago! Rotting in h—""

I was furious, “Shut up!”

Ignoring the pain in my scalp, I swung my arm and hit her hard across the face.

Zaria had been spoiled her whole life; she couldn't hold her own against me in a fight.

I grabbed her by the hair and slammed her head into the wall, just as the front door opened just as our parents burst in.

They shouted and rushed over to pull us apart, but I didn’t forget to deliver a final kick to Zaria.

As Mom cradled Zaria's swollen face, screaming, Dad didn’t ask a single question. Without hesitation, he hit me across the face, his eyes fill with fury:

“Nyla, have you lost your mind? Over a boy?!""

I covered my face and looked at my father, my voice defiant, though my eyes were full of unshed tears.

“I hit her because she insulted Grandma, said she should go to h-”

Zaria, still crying in Mom’s arms, managed to struggle and shout, “I didn’t say that!”

Mom pointed at me, gritting her teeth. “You’re making things up! Zaria’s always been gentle and well-mannered. No wonder Ronan prefers Zaria. He doesn’t want you!”

Dad's glare turned glacial. To him, daughters were bargaining chips—whichever secured the Alpha's favor.

I snorted and, from the corner, grabbed my phone. I played the recording I had just taken.

Neither Mom nor Zaria had expected me to record the conversation, and their faces turned pale as they heard it.

After the recording finished, Dad turned to Zaria in disbelief:

“Did you know that Luna Renna and your grandmother were childhood friends? If she hears this, how do you think you’ll become the Luna of the Emberwind pack?”

Only when it came to their own interests did Mom show any concern. Still, she was too worried about Zaria to be fully remorseful.

She said, “She’s already hurt so badly, don’t you think you should take her to the pack doctor? Can’t you wait until she’s better before talking about this?”

I closed my eyes, and a deep sense of sadness washed over me.

Even Grandma's memory only mattered when it affected their status.

What about me, the unloved daughter?

What hope had I ever held?

**Chapter 3**

A week later, my parents took both of us to the pack’s bonfire party.

The bonfire party was incredibly boring. I didn’t know a single person, so I sat in a corner, lost in thought, trying to come up with new plot twists for a mystery.

My parents were busy using the fact that their daughter was about to become the pack’s Luna as a way to socialize, trying to find business partners for their company.

Zaria, with her arm around Ronan, came over to me. I glanced at them, then continued eating while still lost in my puzzle.

Ronan said, ""Nyla.""

I paused, raising my head to look at him.

Zaria pouted and tugged on his sleeve.

Ronan spoke, ""Zaria's still young, and she makes mistakes. Please be patient with her. But you can’t hit her. Your temper’s too volatile. You really need to work on it.""

I put my plate down and sneered, ""What are saying? Call me Luna. I’ve already severed the mate bond with you. Don’t try to get close.""

Ronan stiffened, his expression darkening.

""Nyla, I know you're upset. But you two are fighting because of me, and it hurts me too.""

A wave of disgust surged inside me.

""How did I never realize before that you were so narcissistic? My grandmother always told me there were fools in the pack, and today, I’ve had the honor of meeting one. You’re shameless.""

With that barrage of insults, both of their faces darkened.

Zaria, furious and ready to spit out curses, suddenly remembered to maintain her image in front of Ronan.

She whimpered and pretended to hide in his arms.

""Ronan, now you’ve seen how fierce Nyla can be, right? I’ve been scolded by her since I was little. It’s really scary.""

Ronan, pitying her, pulled Zaria closer to him and looked at me, his face pale with anger. ""Nyla, what happened to you? I’m really disappointed in you!""

Just as I was about to snap back at him, a familiar yet unfamiliar voice interrupted:

""Do you really need to be disappointed with My Luna?""

A man with messy hair stood up from the sofa behind us.

Holding a glass of drink, he looked at Ronan with a sidelong glance. ""You’re calling pack Luna by her name? That’s so uncultured.""

Ronan gasped, ""Uncle Cassian?""

Uncle?

""Don’t call me that.""

Ronan lowered his head, ""Alpha Cassian.""

The man I had spent the night with was him!

""You’re Alpha Cassian?"" Zaria shocked.

**Chapter 4**

Cassian rubbed his tired eyes and stood up from the sofa.

He was over 6 feet.

His well-tailored suit pants clung to his long legs, and his linen shirt was unbuttoned at the collar. I couldn’t help but blush when I remembered that night, when I had kissed his collarbone.

He walked around the sofa and squeezed in next to me, casually resting his arm on the back of my chair in a protective manner.

When he turned his head to look at me, my heart involuntarily began to race.

Zaria was stunned.

She unconsciously released the hand she had tightly held around Ronan's, gasping, ""Him... is that Alpha Cassian? I thought you said...""

She suddenly covered her mouth and, after a couple of seconds of thinking, sweetly called out, ""Cassian.""

Cassian gave her a half-smile, his tone tinged with sarcasm.

""Aren’t you supposed to be Ronan’s fiancee? He calls me Alpha Cassian, and you call me just Cassian? How dare you!""

His tone became stern, and Zaria quickly lowered her head, whispering, ""Alpha.""

Ronan stood up abruptly, pulling Zaria along with him, his face dark with frustration.

""We’ll leave you two alone.""

Without a second thought, he dragged a struggling Zaria away.

Once they were gone, Cassian immediately turned his gaze back to me.

""Why did you leave alone that morning?""

His question was so direct that I instantly blushed, fumbling for words. ""Uh...""

I stammered for a long time without managing to say anything.

Cassian raised an eyebrow. ""You were talking fine just now. Why the silence now?""

He leaned in close to my ear, his voice low. ""What makes him any better than me?""

I was momentarily stunned, not sure how to respond.

Cassian chuckled softly, tousling my hair. ""I’m just kidding. Let me take you to meet my mom, former Luna Renna.""

When I was a child, Renna used to visit my grandmother every year.

Since my grandmother lived alone on the outskirts of the pack, near the coast, far from the pack’s center, Renna always brought a lot of delicious food when she visited, but she never ate any of it herself. Instead, she always had my grandmother cook for her.

Unfortunately, after that, my parents only ever took my sister to visit Grandma, and I didn’t get to see Luna Renna. There were various reasons for the rare times I did see her.

Counting the years, it had already been 20 years since I last saw her.

Cassian took my hand and led me toward Renna.

Just then, my parents suddenly appeared, looking a bit upset.

As soon as I called out ""Luna Renna,"" my mother grabbed my arm, pulling me toward the door. My father blocked my way, chatting with Renna in a casual manner.

Confused and stumbling, I managed to take a couple of steps when Cassian suddenly pulled me back forcefully.

He coldly shoved me toward Renna’s side, pressing my shoulder down and said, ""Mom, look who’s here.""

Renna looked just as puzzled, holding my hand and examining me closely.

""Cassian, what are you up to now? This is the Elwoods’ youngest daughter, right? Her name is... Zaria, right?""

My eyes widened in shock, a chill running down my spine.

""Luna Renna, I’m Nyla.""

Renna, half-pulling her glasses off, stared at me in confusion.

""Sweetheart, is Cassian making you prank me?""

She turned to my dad, saying, ""Your father already came to see me with your sister Nyla earlier today.""

Tears welled up in my eyes as I shook my head, holding onto Renna’s hand tightly.

""No, Luna Renna, I’m Nyla!""

My father, panicked, grabbed me and tried to pull me away without saying a word.

In the midst of the chaos, I shouted, ""Luna Renna, do you remember the stewed beef? It was your favorite. That year, I was naughty and secretly added a spoonful of hot sauce! When you arrived, the whole pot of meat was way too spicy, and I was running around the house as Grandma chased me.""

I continued.

""It was you! You were the one who hugged me and asked why. I told you it was because you were tired of the taste last year, and you felt uncomfortable for days. I wanted to...""

Renna stood up shakily, finishing my sentence.

""You said you wanted to make the meat spicier so I wouldn’t feel sick of it!""

The next moment, Luna Renna, with a fierce shout, pointed at my father and yelled:

""Let go of her!""",1,1747134100.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Joy has gone AWOL. We think she’s going after Evie. – Isiah

Zydeco, the enforcer for the Baton Rouge Cajuns, got the message when they stopped for gas in the early afternoon. He called Gator, his club president, who had received the same message. Walking away from his men, he listened to the few details that the other man had.

He, like most of the other men with him, wore his hair pulled back in a ponytail. While he was on the phone, his fingers ran through it in frustration. After hanging up and shoving his phone back into his pocket, he turned to the four other men with him. Pulling his hair back into a ponytail, he looked over at his friends and brothers.

They all wore jeans and thick soled motorcycle boots. Most of them wore dark t-shirts under their leather cuts. Santa wore his typical bright red shirt. On the back of the club cut was a golden outline of the state of Louisiana filled with the state flag. The blue background with a pelican, her wings partially spread, as she looks down at her three hatchlings.

“Cajuns, piss if you need to. Call your ladies. We’re going up north to Evie.” Zydeco said as he punched in the address that Gator texted to him separately. He didn’t need to give any more details, they all received the same mass text from the club president. “I’ve got lead, we leave in five.”

Evie was the widow of Zydeco’s nephew, Cade. Their other partner, and her legal husband, Daniel, and Cade had both been killed while in the line of duty just under four years ago.

Daniel’s mother, Joy, held Evie responsible for her son’s death. While still grieving her loss, and fighting deep depression, Evie had to get a restraining order against her former mother-in-law. Last year, Evie moved away from the town that held so many memories of her husbands to Massachusetts to start over.

Halfway across the country did not seem far enough if Joy had broken her house arrest for violating the restraining order earlier in the year when Evie’s new men brought her home for a weekend. Now it appeared that Joy had disappeared to drive from Austin, Texas all the way up to Ridgeview, Massachusetts.

Almost exactly five minutes later, they pulled out onto interstate 20 in Tallulah, Louisianna. From the northeastern corner of their state, they headed back out, going eastward this time. GPS estimated the travel time at nearly twenty-two hours. They stopped again just after midnight, about halfway to their destination.

“Do we need to take a break? Everyone good to go through the night?” Zydeco asked.

“That’s our girl.” Darkness said. “We’re good.”

The other men agreed, and they continued through the night. Around five they stopped at an all-night McDonald’s. The meal was quick and the coffee plenty.

Near midday, about an hour outside of Ridgeview, they stopped for gas and more caffeine. Zydeco called his brother-in-law. He was angry when he ended the call.

“Cajuns!” he called as he mounted his bike. “Our girl’s been shot. Let’s go.”

Making good time it was less than an hour later when they parked with a large group of bikes and walked towards the emergency room doors.

“Priest, got your dog collar?” Zydeco asked.

“I got my creds.” He confirmed just before they entered the hospital. With the door closing behind them, Priest pulled out his wallet and found the card showing that he was a chaplain with a well-known veteran’s organization.

The two men walked up to the window for the clerk. As they worked on getting Priest in the back with Evie, the other three sat down. Darkness sat next to the heavily tattooed man who looked completely lost.

Darkness was a tall man at a little over six feet. He had broad shoulders and corded muscles covering his body. Like his father before him, he had been scouted by the NFL. Unlike his father, he did not pursue it.

Swampthang, a young brunette, leaned into Santa and quietly asked “You think she remembers how to have sex with just one man?”

He spoke quietly and in creole. But Darkness heard the man sitting across from him and gave them both a warning glare.

“If you want to die, go ask one of her men.” Stroking his long white beard, Santa replied with a small laugh and Darkness nodded.

“They’re letting Priest back. That dog collar of his comes in handy sometimes.” Zydeco said in English as he sat down across from Darkness. “Anybody know where The Thief is?”

Darkness shook his head as he grinned at his adopted father. It was an old argument that all the Cajuns knew.

Zydeco's sister left Louisianna when she married Roscoe a little over three decades ago. During that time, he had worked his way through the ranks and was now the president of the Austin chapter of the Texas Renegades. Ever since, he had called Roscoe \*The Thief\*. He even had a nameplate with it. He swore that one day he would get it on Roscoe’s cut, even though the Texas charter did not use road names. They all simply answered to the name \*Renegade\*.

The others continued to talk for a while, Darkness ignored them. He was watching the doors wanting to see the Renegades come through the glass doors. Or Priest come in from the back.

He was not many years older than Evie and saw her as the little sister that he needed to protect. Even more so after the incident that suddenly took her men from her. But from what little Eves and her brother had said, she was now in a much better place.

And she had two new men. Presumably, the two men next to him that looked like they were losing their world.

Soon enough the Renegades walked in. Dixie went straight to the two men sitting in the cramped chairs next to Darkness. They wrapped her up between them and held on to their woman’s mother.

She was a tiny woman, especially compared to her own three men. And even more so compared to her daughter’s two men. The five feet three woman disappeared between the two muscled men. One was built like a tank and the other covered in tattoos.

Isiah, one of Dixie's three husbands, went to talk to the clerk and she buzzed him back. A moment later, Priest came back and said that she was on some good meds.

“Kept asking the cop if she could use his handcuffs.” Priest grinned. “She’s definitely your child, Dixie.”

Laughing, Dixie declared that at least one of her daughters took after her. After her daughter’s men released her, the tiny woman moved to the large dark man. He stood and lifted her up in a strong hug.

“She'll be okay.” Dixie whispered as he held her close.

Four years ago, when he was overseas with the Navy, he filed for emergency leave and flew home for his adopted sister. He didn’t care that they had to lie to the government and the Navy. His Little Eves needed him, and he would be there.

A few years later, her brother, Law, had been stationed in Maine. Darkness had only been a few hours away. When Isiah brought a very depressed Evie to stay with her brother, he called their old friend. They took turns staying with her and keeping her safe until she was through the darkness that the two men knew well.

The two presidents spoke and then Roscoe and his wife sent most of the Renegades to the local clubhouse. Zydeco ordered all his men to go also, they had all been up for over twenty-four hours.

Pulling into the large compound for a converted hotel with tan colored bricks and black trim around the windows and doors, Darkness was surprised by the size and, for the lack of other words, amenities. There was a sign pointing to the pool, a multi-story parking garage and what looked like a gun range at the back of the property.

But the real surprise for him would come once he was inside.

Sensing the protective spirits, Darkness closed his eyes and listened.

“You good?” Zydeco asked and his adoptive son nodded.

“The spirits are worried.” Darkness said looking at the man who raised him.",1,1747134078.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

Harper

I watch as my mother lays sprawled out on the patchwork sofa drunk again. It is the story of my life, she has one arm hanging down to the ground and a practically empty bottle of booze, Vodka I think, I can't see the label hugged to her chest. Funny how she can manage to clutch on to a bottle of booze and nothing else. Her breathing is low, I wonder if it will be her last breath, do I care? I should but my mother has been a drunk ever since I can remember and a junkie, not the heroin kind no she likes cocaine and her boyfriends that come and go are her suppliers. I swear she only hooks up with low life deadbeats for her next fix. But yes, I would care, because you know what she is my mother, and she is the only mother I've got.

I want to shake her and wake her up, maybe if she'd managed to stay clean my father wouldn't have left when I was just a kid, five years of age to be precise. It still hurts. I remember him holding me tightly to him and kissing me, telling me how much he loved me, how precious I was to him and how often he would see me. Which he did, I mean sure he works away a lot, he is in finance and travels with his business so nowadays I don't get to see him all that much but he has always been and still is a good dad.

My phone buzzes in my denim cut off shorts. I take it out of my back pocket. Where are you, thought we were meeting up now. We've got an assignment to hand in tomorrow.

I bite my lip, shit I totally forgot what the time was. Instead of keeping track of it I have been reading in my bedroom and writing in my journal at times. Laying out all my hurt, anger and pain about my situation. I text Dylan back, he's my ex-boyfriend. We dated for five years in High School and in college. We have managed to remain friends which is a good thing because right now I have nobody else. I have a couple of girlfriends, but I wouldn't say we're that close, not like Dylan and I. He became my best friend; I had liked him ever since my mom moved us here to Lincoln in the small suburb that is now home. His folks lived across the street, but now it's just his father. His hot, sexy father I have to say. That man could melt your panties right off.

I'm not going to lie; I have had some serious dreams about his daddy. I daren't tell anyone because you know he's my ex's daddy and all of that, and he is much older. Of course he would be, Dylan told me he was just seventeen when Dylan was born so that would make him thirty-seven to my twenty years of age. Anyway, I need to message Dylan back and get my shit together. We have a study date. I don't want to be stuck in a hell hole like this forever.

He is majoring in Politics, and I am studying business and finance, I want to take after my own father and work in a large corporation and travel the world and get out of dodge. I want the big house, the fancy car, I want to buy as much make-up, shoes and clothes as I want, not be in hand-me-downs forever. Kids used to poke fun at me at school, seriously I hated being at school.

If it wasn't for Dylan always being there for me, I probably would have just skipped class all the time. But he was there for me, and I am grateful to him for that.

Sure, I am on my way. Sorry I got waylaid.

Your mother again?

Yeah, something like that. She is out stone cold on the sofa, total waste of fucking space.

Hey, that's your mom all said and done, don't speak about her like that. She needs help, Harper.

How can I help a woman who doesn't want to help herself?

We can figure something out.

Yeah, we've been trying that for the last God knows how many years, it's exhausting, it is mentally draining, and you know what, I just don't think I can take it no more.

Come on over, my dad is here, he's making his famous lasagna.

That buoys my spirits up some, the thought of watching Levy cooking and perving over him makes me warm down there and sends a rush of heat through my entire body. Shit, I need to get control of this, if Dylan even suspects I've got the hots for his daddy he will ditch me hotter than hot coals.

On my way. See you soon.

My mom calls out for me, I ignore her then feel like a complete loser myself so go grab a blanket from the chair near the sofa she is laying on and drape it over her.

""I have to go, Mommy, I've got study with Dylan.""

""Okay, Baby. See you later."" She drifts off again and I stare down at her tiny, frail body not even sure when it was, she ate last.

""Try to eat something, Mommy."" I bend down and kiss the top of her head. I know she can't hear me, she's out cold again. I move the bottle from her arm and leave it on the coffee table beside the sofa, that is strewn with cigarettes, an over full ashtray, an empty bottle of Brandy and an old note still rolled up from her doing lines last night. I shake my head. Help, how on earth can I get her help. We don't have money, my father won't help her anymore, she's been in rehab several times over the years costing him a pretty dollar and for nothing. As soon as she is back out, she's back on everything.

My bag is on the floor by the front door that needs painting, I sling it over my shoulder and close the front door quietly behind me. At least I can check Levy out, that's something that will cheer me up. I am dying to tell my favorite girlfriend, Summer all about him but I know she'll tell me I am gross for fancying an older man. I shrug my shoulders, who cares what they think. I don't give a flying fuck.

Outside it's already cool now that we are in Fall, the trees have turned color and displaying their brightness of reds, oranges, yellows and russets. Fall is my all-time favorite time of the year, the air is crisp and it's such a welcome break from all the damn heat and humidity of the summer.

Dylan only lives across the road so it's no shakes to walk across and be there in a couple of minutes. The door is open, I never need to knock, his father has always made me welcome and his mother. Only, his mother isn't alive anymore. She died two years ago of cancer, it started in her breast but by the time they found it, well it had spread too far inside her body eating at her. It was a tragic time for them and honestly, I am not sure that Dylan and his daddy, Levy have recovered. How do you recover from something like that?

I can smell something delicious coming from the small kitchen at the back of the house. I know I ought to go upstairs straight to Dylan's room where we always study but I can't resist going into the kitchen where I know Levy will be.

He stands there at the cooker and takes my breath away. His curly, dark hair is tied into a man-bun, his tight black T-shirt fits him perfectly and outlines his tight body, his biceps are on display and fuck me, he is as hot as sin. I want to trail my fingers up his arms, touch the ink on his forearms that continue up and under the sleeves of his T-shirt. The familiar sensation of wetness is between my legs, my breath hitches. He glances up and looks at me, and winks. My legs almost go to jelly and buckle, fuck I want this man like I've never wanted any other man before. Not even Dylan. Sure, the sex was good with Dylan but I bet Levy knows exactly how to satisfy a girl.

""How you doing, Sunflower?"" He asks, making me swoon for him. I love it when he calls me Sunflower. He said once that I am like the brightness of that flower representing summer and all things bright, on a dark and grey, miserable day.

""Er, yeah, I'm fine Mr Hudson.""

He cocks an eyebrow, fuck my panties are getting wetter, I am practically drooling at the way his tight black jeans hug his ass, I want to run my hands over it and then explore what he has tucked in the front.

""Levy. You call me Levy, Sunflower. Not Mr Hudson.""

I walk into the kitchen, wait what am I doing? I want to stand near him, I want to inhale him, he's like a hypnotic drug and I can't stop myself. He turns placing the wooden spoon down on the dish by the side of the hob. I can feel his eyes on my body as he looks from my eyes to my lips, down to my chest, his green, sultry eyes taking me in like a long, cold drink of lemonade. Quickly as if he realizes what he is doing, he turns away and coughs.

""Dylan is upstairs,"" he tells me his voice gruff. There is only one reason it's that way, because I am betting the sight of me in my tiny shorts even though it's cooler outside and my tight, white button down is making him have a reaction to me that he wished he didn't have.

# Chapter 2

Levy

I know it's hot in the kitchen where I'm cooking but more to the point it's Harper, that girl is all woman but there's a problem she is just twenty years of age. Being anywhere near her is killing me that and she's my boy's ex-girlfriend. Fucked up, right? You bet it is.

I'm old enough to be her dad, okay so being thirty-eight isn't like ancient but I had Dylan when his mother and I were just kids ourselves at eighteen. We had an accident, but hell let me tell you, Dylan was the best accident in the world. We loved him like no tomorrow, he was our entire universe, and he still is mine.

It hasn't been easy. When Lilly died three years ago, it was hard to watch her suffer whilst the cancer ate away at her and I became the only parent to Dylan. To be honest, I had to be the main parent ever since Lilly first became sick. I stir the food.

""So, Levy how's it going?"" Harper asks me, is she standing too close to me? I like the way my name sounds as she says it, like silk. I wonder even though I shouldn't how it would sound coming from her lips if I had my cock inside her. Fuck I need to stop thinking about Harper like that. She's just a kid in my eyes even though she's twenty and by rights a woman now. I wish I didn't feel like this but Man that girl has all grown up.

She's no longer the kid with braces and glasses who'd come over and play with Dylan when they were eleven going on thirty, the little girl who'd fall off his skateboard and need a plaster on her knee. No way, this girl is all grown up with long, lean legs from all the running she does, her waist is small, I reckon I could span my hands around it easily and that long blonde hair of hers, hangs down her back like a waterfall. I try to focus on the food I'm cooking instead of her butt in those skimpy shorts she is wearing. Do you reckon she knows what she's doing to me.

""It's going well, Sunflower. Don't you want to go hang with Dylan?"" I have to get rid of her, I'm bursting in my pants right now and hugging as close to the hob and counter as much as I can without burning myself. There is no way I can let her see she's causing me to have an erection which is killing me in my jeans.

""Sure, I'll go up and see him in a bit, I kinda like talking to you, Levy."" Damn I could easily crush my lips on hers and press her up against my groin. The heat is getting to me, I can't tell if it's the hot food cooking away on the hob or her close proximity to me right now.

She moves closer to me, she smells of jasmine, it fills my nostrils. I want to move towards her and reach my hands around her waist and kiss her with such a force it takes me by surprise. Instantly, I feel guilty. I shouldn't feel like this about Harper. Of all people not her but she is difficult to resist. I place the wooden spoon down that I've been stirring the food with and move back slightly. She comes closer. Her corn blue eyes are wide and innocent looking. I don't even want to wonder if she is still a virgin or not, God help me I don't want to think about if Dylan and Harper have had sex.

""Maybe you should go up now, Harper."" I growl at her more fiercely thank I perhaps should have done. She looks surprised, her eyebrows raise then she cocks her head. I watch as she runs her tongue across her bottom lip and feel my cock twitch in my pants.

""Hey, you're here."" Dylan says as he comes bowling into the kitchen. ""Wondered where the hell you got to. You said you'd be here in a few minutes. Hey Dad when will dinner be ready, I'm starving?"" The kid is always starving, I swear he has hollow legs. He's lean like a basketball player.

""Not long. Say, why don't you kids go on up and study and I'll give you a shout in around thirty minutes or so.""

""I'm not a kid anymore."" Harper tells me and places a hand on her hip that she juts out. Fuck me, she's going to undo me any minute now.

""You're always going to be kids to me."" I tell her gruffly.

""Yeah, Dad we're like twenty now, news flash coming in. We. Are. Not. Kids."" Dylan swats me playfully on the arm. ""C'mon Harper we've got work to do and you're slacking. Is your mom okay?"" He always worries about Harper's mom. It's no secret the woman has issues and is a drunk, we've tried to help by being there for her and for Harper, but she just can't let the drinking go. I've cooked more dinners for Harper over the years and Lilly too when she was alive, than Harper's own mother.

""She's fine. You know how it is. Hanging on to the damn bottle on the sofa.""

""You can take her some dinner over later, Sunflower."" My voice is softer this time. I'd do anything to make Harper's life better. Literally anything. The girl is special, she's always full of sunshine and roses, nothing gets her down and when Lilly died, she was there for Dylan and I. Always making sure we were good to go and cooking for us when we couldn't face doing it.

""I'll grab us some water, Dylan go on up, I'll be right behind you."" She tells my son then looks at me and winks. God fucking help me, she's going to be the death of me.

Dylan takes himself out of the kitchen and heads back up the stairs. Harper comes and stands by my side at the kitchen sink. My arms are folded across my chest, my ankles crossed as I lean against the counter. She brushes her arm against mine, electric pulses through my entire body like a shock. It's been a very long time since any kind of touch has done that to me. She leans across me to grab a glass from the cupboard by my head, her breast brushes against my bicep.

""Just letting you know, Levy that I'm all woman now Levy.""

# Chapter 3

Harper

It sure was fun watching Levy suffer like that. He's a man, I know he's tempted and best of all he's an older man, a man with experience. All girls like that, right? A man who'll know exactly what to do, not like boys. I love his broad shoulders and those sexy, black tattoos he has running up his arms, let me tell you he is such a turn on. I wonder how big his dick is and cannot wait to get home later tonight to play with my vibrator thinking about Levy fucking me.

""Earth calling, Harper. Where's your head at?"" Dylan asks as he turns to look at me coming through his bedroom. It's painted in sky blue with a double bed on the right, his writing and study desk on the left wall and he still has his dinosaurs on display from when he was a kid. Some things will never change.

""Oh, nowhere."" I tell him as I flop myself down on the bed, dumping my bag with my books in it on the floor.

""I know that look, is it a boy? Tell me, are you seeing someone new.""

""Hell no. Are you seeing a girl?"" It doesn't fuss me if he does, we dated for five years and it was good, you know we were best friends growing up and it just seemed natural that we became boyfriend and girlfriend so if he is seeing another girl, I say good for him. Dylan deserves to be happy especially having gone through what he went through when his mother died. My heart was ripped apart for him, but he's doing much better now and has been to counselling and is dealing with the grief. Thankfully he never turned to drink or used drugs like some kids I know.

""Nah, I need to focus on my studies, Harp. Too much riding on it. I want to do well and get myself a good job.""

""Your daddy does well, can't you go into business with him?"" His father owns a chain of motorcycle stores across the country, he's no billionaire but he has a lot of money. I can't lie it's another reason he turns me on because he is a self-made man, and he rides a bike. I'd sure as hell love to get on the back of it and go for a ride with him, fuck I'd like to ride Levy that's for sure. I go dreamy again, wondering about his touch on me, how his fingers would feel inside my pussy. I squeeze my thighs together.

Dylan looks at me weirdly. ""What you looking at me like that for?"" I ask him.

""You look fucking goofy is why, Harp. Who you thinking about? I know it's a guy, spill already."" Shit, I can't let him know I'm having wet dreams about his daddy, fuck that'd really harm our friendship and since Dylan is like my best friend in the entire world, I can't risk him ever finding out.

""Ah, you know just day dreaming, Dylan. So, tell me, are you going to Lacey's party tomorrow night? I hear there will be a live band playing. I'm so excited to finally go to a party all this studying is giving me a headache.""

""I wasn't going to but you know, I think we both need a break. Let's do it."" We high five and I love to see him smile, he's going to be alright I can feel it.

""What shall I wear? Thinking maybe my torn black denims, a rock T-shirt with my bright pink bra underneath and some chains around my neck."" He raises his eyebrows and chuckles.

""You trying to look like my dad?""

""What? Does your dad wear a bright pink bra now?"" I chuckle. Dylan throws a cushion at me.

""No, the whole black outfit thing.""

Oops maybe I'm giving myself away a bit too obviously. ""I just fancy a change is all.""

""Well, whatever you do, don't go dying your hair. It's so pretty all that blonde color and natural.""

""I'd never dye my hair; I love it too much.""

""Yeah, it's real Blake Lively on you."" He turns and starts opening one of his assignment books. ""You should start dating again, Harp. You know I'll always love you, right? Just I've noticed you haven't been out with anyone since we split in the summer.""

Oh, hell. How do I tell him that's because I don't want a boy anymore, I want his daddy and his daddy alone. I can't stop thinking about Levy and I know that I started thinking differently about Levy over the summer. Maybe it's all the changes my body has been going through lately, my hormones or maybe I'm just growing up.

""Yeah, maybe."" I shrug my shoulders, and let my hair fall slightly over my face as I can feel myself blushing.

We study peacefully next to each other, cramped on his study table, just like we've always done. Dylan has a playlist on, it's mostly grunge because that is what he's into. Me I like all sorts of music, currently I'm into Taylor Swift but Dylan can't stand her. We have had many an argument over Miss Swift let me tell you. He always gives in though and lets me listen to her, so yeah, today I'll let him play his grunge music.

His dad calls up to announce dinner is ready. I close my study book quicker than a bat out of hell, causing Dylan to glance up at me then bolt downstairs like lightning. ""Hey, wait for me."" He calls after me.

Levy's muscles flex as he places the heavy dish of food in the middle of the table, I want to run my fingers up his arms and squeeze his bicep. ""Take a seat young lady."" Oo, I like it when he calls me lady. Dylan throws himself in a chair next to me and his daddy takes the chair the other side of me. As Dylan stretches over for the serving spoon, I take the opportunity to move my chair closer to Levy, without Dylan noticing.

I can feel the heat coming from his body as I allow my thigh to brush up against his. Levy drops the bottle of beer that was about to hit his lips. He starts coughing. I slap him on the back. ""Are you okay, Levy?"" My voice all sweet as sugar and candy.

""Yeah, yeah just went down the wrong way is all."" He recovers himself and picks the bottle of beer up. Dylan hands him a cloth he retrieved from the sink behind us.

""Here you go, Dad. I'll get you a fresh beer.""

""Thanks, Son."" Levy glares at me, his dark eyes are brooding. I slide my hand under the table and squeeze his thigh. He grabs my hand, my pulse is racing at the intensity of the heat and the scorching feeling from his large, calloused hand on mine. Dylan is chatting away completely oblivious to what is going on under the table.

Levy almost hurts my hand as he squeezes it and removes it from his own thigh and places it on my thigh. ""Stop it."" He hisses in my ear, his warm breath sending tingles up and down my spine.

Not fucking likely I think to myself. I want this man and if it's the last thing I do I will have Levy one way or another.",1,1747133957.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I intentionally ate the foods that usually leave me bloated, foggy, and drained—processed carbs, added sugars, seed oils, you name it.

Why?

To see just how badly it would impact my mental performance, energy, and digestion… and then test how quickly I could reverse it with the gut-health protocol I’ve been refining over the past few months.

Here’s what happened:

**Day 1:**  
– Coffee on an empty stomach  
– All-bran cereal with milk and honey  
– A vanilla muffin  
→ Ran a cognitive test after. My reaction time dropped noticeably.  
→ Focus faded fast. Cravings kicked in harder than usual.

**Lunch:**  
White rice with soya-based chicken a la king and chocolate  
→ Took a 4-minute sustained attention test.  
→ My mind literally tired out halfway. Score dropped. Mood dipped. Brain felt foggy.

**Dinner:**  
Same meal. Lindt chocolate. No fasting window.  
→ I craved food all night. No satiety. Just constant low energy.

**Sleep was already broken (dad to a newborn here), and the poor food choices amplified everything.**  
Brain fog, irritability, low motivation, even physical inflammation.

This wasn’t a random reset.  
It was a calculated gut-health protocol I’ve been testing behind the scenes to improve energy, mood, and focus without depending on caffeine or supplements.

**Started the reset today. I’m now tracking digestion, cravings, focus, and reaction scores day by day.**

Happy to share the protocol or more insights if anyone’s interested and will update this accordingly.

I then checked the resistance of the pump with the help of a youtube tutorial and it seemed the pump was dying.
So I replaced the pump with a new one, a bit different though, it had a brass connection instead of plastic but I installed it, checked for leaks and all seemed fine.

But now the pressure goes up to about 13 bar and then falls to 7 bar (with coffee and blind filter).

The joyful, chaotic pinnacle of the eurofan calendar is here. Tonight we will at last enjoy eighteen cutting-edge performances and feel our pulses skyrocket as we discover at last which ten of tonight's semi-finalists will 'FLY! BIRD!' all the way into Saturday's Grand Final, and which five will be rowing merrily back home. Before that, allow me to calm your nerves with a spot of levity through a tongue-in-cheek write-up of each country's chances, just like I also did for the [last two years](https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1cma72v/semifinal_1_why_your_favourite_will_make_it_and/). So sit back, pour yourself an espresso macchiato from your coffee machine, light the fire in your cozy Basel Alpine log cabin, and take a breather with me before the madness begins. As ever, please **don't take anything here too seriously,** and remember I'm writing this as a regular Eurovision fan lost in the excitement, confusion, hopium and copium of Eurovision euphoria, not as a subreddit moderator.

**Iceland:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * It's a lively, fun opener with some great visual moments
   * Eurofans underestimated the appeal of similarly energetic twins in 2011, and VAEB have similarly endearing chaotic energy
   * Minecraft aesthetics will draw in the epic gamer vote
   * We need more of their unhinged social media presence for the rest of the week.
* *Why they might not:*
   * Has stiff competition from other better-favoured light-hearted entries in the semi-final
   * Vocally they've been a bit weak in most performances, and the excitement of performing first on the night might make for even more wayward vocals
   * The ghost of the Play Ja Ja Ding Dong guy haunts every Icelandic entry, cursing them to NQification until 'Ja Ja Ding Dong' is selected as the actual Icelandic entry

**Poland:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Glorious chaos! The staging subscribes to what I call 'the kitchen sink' approach, with a non-stop train of new ideas that entertain from start to finish
   * Justyna is an amazing performer, capable of hitting impressive vocals whilst doing acrobatics on stage
   * She's the only female soloist competing in the entire semi-final, which will help her stand out a lot (see, for example, Italy's 2014 JESC victory)
   * 'ethno-bops' are a tried and tested popular Eurovision genre
* *Why they might not:*
   * The dreaded curse of the #2 slot could strike again, an early draw position in a show full of attention-grabbing performances
   * Poland is surprisingly lacking in regular diaspora voting allies in this semi-final, with their most prominent voting allies all voting in the other semi-final (i.e. Ireland, UK, Germany)
   * Too *much* chaos. From what we know of the staging it makes 2022 and 2023's heavily memed stagings look tame
   * That which holds the image of a dragon becomes a dragon; the CGI dragon escapes from the backdrop and steals Justyna away back to its treasure trove

**Slovenia:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * It's the only pure competing ballad in the entire semi, and results from the past few years have shown there is a market in the televote for ballads
   * The song and staging revamps convey the story of the lyrics powerfully, making it very accessible and sympathetic to first time listeners
   * Klemen already foretold his victory this year at the end of his winners' tribute imitation. You wouldn't want to make him a lie, would you?
* *Why they might not:*
   * An early draw often works against quieter songs like this, and with all the big performances and staging concepts he could easily be forgotten
   * The song has been generally unfavoured by the wider fandom, especially for the lyrics being too on the nose, a response that many casuals might share
   * Klemen realises that his upside staging has actually granted him gravity superpowers. He promptly quits the competition to go and fight crime instead.

**Estonia:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * It's fun and accessible and everybody's casual fan friends seem to love it
   * Tommy Cash has one of the biggest pre-established fanbases of this year's artists
   * Tommaso Cashiato's staging plays into comedy and has a couple of extra gags compared to Eesti Laul, and laughter is a universal language
* *Why they might not:*
   * Thomas Leopold Money is a divisive character whose on and off stage persona is off-putting to as many as it is endearing
   * Perhaps the audience cares about vocals in this kind of song more than we expect, and Tom Dollar's vocal performances have been a bit unpleasant so far
   * There's a disappointing lack of actual spaghetti on stage (outside of Timothy Cush's legs)

**Ukraine:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * The song is catchy, full of retro charm, and stands out by sounding different to your standard ESC song
   * It's Ukraine. Their 100% qualification record is not in any jeopardy as long as they are under Russian bombardment, and they'd have to send something awful and/or controversial for the masses of displaced Ukrainians to not want to support their nation.
   * FLY! BIRD!
* *Why they might not:*
   * It's very different for Ukraine, and sometimes voters seem to reward countries embracing the music they expect to hear from that country, punishing attempts to branch out (see i.e. France 2021/2024 compared to 2022, and Spain 2022 compared to most other Spanish entries)
   * Staging isn't really clicking from the rehearsal clip, and hasn't provided the usual ESC glow-up that Ukrainian stagings often do
   * There is a disappointing lack of birds on stage, and also a lack of actual flight

**Sweden:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Probably the most popular song of the year with the fanbase, and achieving immense domestic success (and even some success in neighbouring countries too)
   * Very likeable performers
   * A polished, amusing, fun and accessible performance
   * YKSI KAKSI KOLME SAAAUUUNAAA
* *Why they might not:*
   * Frustration over how last year turned out ends up directed towards Sweden, and people don't vote because they either assume Sweden is a safe qualifier or are tired of Swedish victories
   * The big sausage that has been teased ends up being so big that it obscures the stage, meaning millions of viewers only see sausage instead of sauna boys

**Portugal:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * In a semi-final full of loud, high-concept performances, something chilled, calm and easy-listening like this will stand out, and the earnestness will have an audience
   * Flawless vocals
   * Portugal has a couple of strong voting allies voting in the semi with Spain and Switzerland, whilst they should also score well with San Marino's jury and potentially the ROW vote
* *Why they might not:*
   * A lot of the appeal is in the lyrics, which tell a story that doesn't seem to be being translated through the staging
   * Portugal were snubbed from being shown as they came out on the Turquoise carpet, so what's stopping the producers from snubbing them again by forgetting to show their performance?
   * Not enough João factor, I mean wow factor

**Norway:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * It's catchy, accessible Eurovision pop, well-performed and memorable
   * Kyle is very charismatic and endearing as the youngest performer in the contest this year
   * Call and response elements have elevated several televote favourites over the past few years (i.e. the 'Woahs' of Croatia 2024, the 'Cha Cha Cha' of Finland 2023). Getting the audience to shout 'No way' which sounds like *Norway* is genius and will make it easy to remember which country this performance was after everybody has performed
   * We've had many 'fighters' over the years, but never a 'lighter'. This innovation deserves to be rewarded
* *Why they might not:*
   * The staging hasn't been elevated much from MGP, and whilst others are wowing with new visuals, Norway instead has a random breakdancer doing flips who distracts attention away from Kyle
   * Could be *too* generic in a semi-final with several televote magnets
   * In blaming Lumo for his tooth, Kyle has accidentally picked a fight with a monster beyond his wildest imagination. Lumo will find you, and he will suck out your life points with those sumptuous lips. It's only a matter of time...

**Belgium:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * They had probably the best rehearsal clip of anybody, and if the rest of the staging is a polished and cool as that, it's going to wow people
   * The vocals are amazing and provide immense wow factor in the conclusion
   * We Will Rave qualified, so why not this? EDM is a popular genre
* *Why they might not:*
   * After initial hype, opinions on the song among fans were fairly lukewarm and it's also had little domestic airplay
   * As suggested by the title, the performance is going to be a nightmare for epileptic or photosensitive viewers and risks overstimulating others
   * Red Sebastian's clones stage a coup to try to steal his identity and gain corporeal form, sabotaging the performance

**Azerbaijan:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Daft Punk with added traditional instrumentation sounds like a recipe for something surprisingly casual-friendly
   * The boys look like they're having good fun on stage
   * The title appeals to the important and often overlooked 'Crossfit/Parkrun' demographic, who vote for it en mass for promoting a healthy jog
* *Why they might not:*
   * His vocal style provokes marmite responses, and reports and the clip show he's not been hitting all the notes either
   * The staging looks surprisingly ineffective
   * Azerbaijan have no strong voting allies any more, so unless the song is exceptional they are always going to have an uphill qualification battle

**San Marino:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Very catchy and accessible, and has only just been pipped for streams by Sweden
   * The so-called 'DJ curse' isn't really a thing, and most DJ acts that weren't already written off before the contest either a) were in the televote top 10 or b) failed due to awful vocals, which Gabry's masked singers don't have
   * Going from the Sanremo jingle song to San Marino Song Contest winner to qualifying for the final and outplacing Italy themselves would be the perfect final act to the meme journey that this song has been on.
   * This is going to be an absolute party in the arena, whose live positive energy will lift it
   * They are almost guaranteed the 12 points from Italy and decent points from Italophilic Albanians, which is about the best San Marino can hope for with no reliable voting allies
* *Why they might not:*
   * The lack of focus on the vocalists risks empty-feeling staging
   * The 'football/arena chant' demographic may not intersect very strongly with the average ESC semi-final watcher
   * A disappointing lack of spaghetti on stage, again. Come on Gabry, you've got a ton of money, bring a giant pot of spaghetti on stage and throw it into the audience!
   * Gabry might feel blue dabadeedabadai and not bring his best energy on stage

**Albania:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * It has the strongest chorus melody of the year (in this humble reviewer's opinion), and the televote rewards good music
   * Beatriçe is a phenomenally charismatic performer and owns the camera with her hypnotic dance moves and powerful vocals
   * Strong bold colours and visuals that not only make the staging pop but help tell the story of Kolë's part in the song
   * Even if some televoters struggle with Kolë's part, it could also have the meme factor that propelled Konstrakta to immense success in 2022
   * Kolë is an inspiration for introverts everywhere
* *Why they might not:*
   * The curse of the subreddit favourite strikes once more
   * Kolë's spoken word part is a little alienating for many casual viewers, and could still be a big roadblock if it's staged in an awkward way
   * A lot of the artistry isn't really clear to first time watchers. We might love the symbolism of Beatriçe's dress and the fact the boxes are laid out like the Shkodër hospital, but this is not going to be appreciated by people who don't know the backstory

**Netherlands:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Stromae-style pop with easy to understand lyrics that tell a clear story should be an easy sell to casual fans
   * Claude oozes charm and comes across as very likeable through the joy on his face
   * An entire performance done in essentially one camera shot has worked well for The Netherlands before (2014) and also for other countries (Greece 2024)
* *Why they might not:*
   * An entire performance done in essentially one camera shot has also worked not so well for The Netherlands before in 2015, and risks feeling flat and lacking the dynamism that standard camerawork can provide
   * Vocals are still a question mark after the rough rehearsal clip
   * The melodic similarity to Love Love, Peace Peace might undermine the authenticity of the message

**Croatia:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * The staging has had a massive glow-up from the NF, with the chaotic camera cuts matching the energy of the song well
   * Witchy aesthetics and stylised camerawork worked wonders for Bambie Thug last year
   * Marko has faced harsh criticism for winning over stronger fan-favourites online and homophobic abuse back home. Perhaps the universe will show kindness to a kind soul
   * Appeals to the important yet unrecognised demographic of 'bake-off' lovers
* *Why they might not:*
   * Near the bottom of most fan polls, and quite a niche song in style to appeal to casual viewers
   * Staging descriptions sound like they've taken the wrong lessons from Poland's recent stagings
   * A disappointing lack of actual cake on stage or in my mouth

**Cyprus:**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * EDM is a very popular genre and the chorus is very catchy
   * Sergio m'fuckin' Jaen is a staging wizard. Who knew that a bunch of hunky blokes climbing on shiny scaffolding could be so enchanting
   * Vocally, Theo is sounding a lot better than the carcrash many imagined
   * The best draw imaginable - very few semi-final closers have failed to qualify
* *Why they might not:*
   * The staging looks good, but it's also lacking the clear powerful aesthetic and theme that 'Doomsday Blue' naturally had, and several rehearsal bloggers haven't been totally convinced
   * The song is still the song, and a lot of us were alienated by the spoken word verses on first listen
   * Rehearsal blogs seem to indicate that he runs out of breath towards the end due to the complex choreography, with his vocals thus suffering
   * Theo Evan gets sued for copyright because he looks like if you put every male Greek/Cypriot representative from the mid 2000s in a blender

Whatever the results tonight, I hope you have a wonderful start to a wonderful week. The Swiss team are really pulling no stops with how amazing the staging looks across the board! Remember to be kind, and may all your favourites qualify!",58,1747133427.0,eurovision,16,0.95,False

ELLIE

I think being the only single person in a group of friends made up entirely of happy couples who have a lot of sex was affecting me, making me think it was time to find the right guy.

Not that I was really looking; I’d just promised myself not to go out with any more bastards or womanizers after everything I’d been through.

But that’s when the problem started—or rather, that’s when the problem walked through the door.

Ben’s younger brother, Ethan, walked into Zoe and Ben’s apartment during one of our gatherings, which involved drinking a lot of alcohol and catching up.

I hadn’t heard much about him. All I knew was that he ran the London office and was returning. Anna should have told me he was... *like that.*

Just by looking at him, I’d say he was the kind of guy I called a Wolf Charming. That was my antithesis to Prince Charming, who, in my mind, was what I didn’t want but probably should want. But I always thought Prince Charmings were too perfect and, consequently, boring.

The Wolf Charming was my ideal type—the kind who has wild sex with you and takes you roughly, but who has that charming side and treats you like a princess the rest of the time.

That was the impression the tall, broad-shouldered man with dark blonde hair gave me when he walked into the room, dressed in a suit on a Saturday. He looked too elegant and at the same time fierce and virile.

“Wolf Charming?” I whispered to Anna as we moved closer to greet him with the rest of the group.

Anna, my best friend, was probably the main reason I had this idea of finding the right guy stuck in my head.

Not that she had told me to do it, but simply because she was married to Will, the hottest and sexiest tattooed ex-player and nerd I had ever met. They were perfect together.

I was still trying to convince the two of them to donate some of Will’s DNA, so I could clone him in a lab. I always say it’s unfair that there’s only one Will. Anna hit the jackpot, and of course, so did Will.

“Bastard Charming, from what I’ve heard from Will,” she whispered back.

My smile faded instantly. Not that I judged before getting to know someone—I didn’t do that; I hated stereotypes and typification as a good scientist should—but hearing that would put any smart woman on guard.

In recent months, I’d worked hard to stay away from any womanizers, bastards, and players in New York.

Swallowing the last sip of beer, I leaned forward, placing the bottle on the coffee table before it was my turn to greet the man with striking light brown eyes. He was a good twenty centimeters taller than me, even in heels.

My stomach churned as I forced a smile in response to his, which revealed perfect teeth.

*Damn... he’s fucking gorgeous.*

I blinked, trying to snap out of the trance.

“Nice to meet you, Ethan. I’m Ellie. Welcome back to New York,” I said, offering my hand while my heart pounded in my chest.

I ignored that, along with the shiver that ran down my spine. Maybe it was because everyone around us was staring with some strange expectation, as if something screamed, two single people in the room, not just me as always.

“Nice to meet you, Ellie.” He shook my hand firmly.

I tried to ignore the quick once-over he gave me, spending way too much time focusing on my breasts. I pulled back as soon as he let go of my hand.

Ben, Will, and Jack gathered on the sofas after Ethan’s arrival, and I pulled Anna into the kitchen for another drink.

“His eyes are just like Ben’s,” she commented.

Yeah, those brown eyes were hypnotic.

“So is the reputation, I mean, before he married Zoe,” I said, making us both laugh. “But don’t let her know I brought that up. She’d eat me alive.”

Zoe and Bennett, or simply Ben, were another couple in my group of friends who were probably influencing me, though I think in a slightly *different* way than Anna and Will.

That’s because both of them were assholes who fell in love before they could kill each other. I don’t know how they’re still alive, maybe because they took out all their anger on each other through sex.

“He checked out your boobs,” Anna said as we entered the kitchen.

Stifling a laugh, she leaned against the island while I got busy opening two beers.

“You managed to notice that? I thought it was in a split second.”

“I think everyone noticed.”

“Ugh! Why was everyone staring?”

“Maybe because you’re the only singles in the room? That makes it interesting to watch when you’re married.”

“Do you really need to remind me? And it’s not like anything’s going to happen between us.”

“I know, I know. No scumbags, bastards, or womanizers. I’ve been hearing that for over a year now?”

“And you’ll keep hearing it until I find the right guy.” I handed her one of the beer bottles.

“To the right guy! May he show up soon!” She raised her bottle, proposing a toast, forcing me to do the same. “And end your bad mood with lots of sex!” she concluded.

“Hey! What bad mood?”

“Excuse me!” The deep voice sounded before he entered the kitchen.

His presence alone was enough to make me uncomfortable.

“Mind if I find Ben’s wine stash?” he asked, making Anna turn to face him.

“I’ll help you,” she offered, guiding him to the wall-mounted wine rack behind me.

I took a long sip of my beer, getting lost in my own thoughts as they discussed wines behind me.

“What do you Morgans take? I know Bennett goes to the gym almost every day, but nothing justifies you growing that much, not just in height,” Anna suddenly said, nearly making me spit out my beer.

God! She, as always, with no filter. I heard him let out a low laugh.

“You’re the scientist, right? Then you can explain genetics.”

“I think there are some things that even scientists like us can’t explain, right, El?” she said, forcing me to turn to them.

“Of course! Whatever you’re talking about, I’m with you.”

“So, you’re also a scientist?” He raised an eyebrow at me.

“Yes, more of a researcher these days.”

“I admit, I had a very different image of scientists in mind,” he said, not bothering to hide the way his eyes moved over my body, leaving me uneasy.

# Chapter 02: Is That a No?

ELLIE

*Shit, Ellie, focus.* He’s definitely not the right guy; he’s more like the completely wrong guy.

I blinked, trying to remember what he had just said.

“Let me guess... White lab coat, glasses, test tubes, and a total nerd?” I raised an eyebrow.

He nodded.

“Something like that.”

“Don’t be fooled. We spend ninety percent of the time dressed exactly like that,” Anna said. “But even now, the nerdiness remains.”

That’s right. That’s my girl.

“You just forgot to mention that we wear high heels,” I added, winking at her.

Ethan sighed.

“That’s the closest you got to making the image of a scientist sexy. Well, thanks for the help, Anna. Finish what you’re doing and join us; it’ll be the first time I’ve had the chance to talk nonsense in front of two scientists,” he said before leaving.

“What the hell was that?” I asked, frowning.

“What?”

“‘What do you take?’”

“It was just curiosity. The man is... huge!”

“As if that’s uncommon and Will isn’t just as big or bigger.”

“Well, Will is... Will.” She shrugged.

“Great argument.”

“What I mean is that Will works out a lot and runs regularly.”

“What I mean is that your question sounded like flirting. It’s obvious he spends a lot of time at the gym.”

“I’m married; it couldn’t have sounded like flirting.”

“You’re terrible!” I laughed.

“I was just trying to be nice.”

“I get it. Where were we?”

“I think we were praying for your ideal guy to show up so you can have lots of sex?”

“You make me sound desperate.”

“I know you’re not. But you really do need to get laid.”

“Just because you have sex every day doesn’t mean everyone else has to. People do other... things.”

“You don’t have to do it every day, at least once a month, but never once a year.”

“What are you getting at?”

“You tell me... How long has it been?”

“That’s enough.”

*A year? Maybe more. It was with that lawyer I met through work. He was hot but too busy. A shame.*

“You’re trying to remember, aren’t you?”

“This conversation is over. My sex life isn’t important when all the available men are bastards.”

“Don’t forget Will and Ben’s past. I don’t forget. So there’s still hope. Sometimes a bastard just needs to discover love.”

“Thanks, but I don’t want to be the reason any bastard changes. And Will and Ben were always good men. Sleeping with lots of people doesn’t make you a bastard. Only when you lie and deceive.”

“I wouldn’t bet on them,” she said, surprising me.

“We’re talking about your husband.”

“I know.”

I blinked, considering it for a moment.

“Come to think of it... neither would I,” I agreed, making us burst into laughter.

“He checked out your ass,” she said when we stopped laughing, making me frown in confusion.

“Huh?”

“Twice, and he lingered the second time when he thought I wasn’t looking.”

“What are you trying to say?”

“He was analyzing you, first your boobs, and now your ass. I’d say he liked it.”

“Why are we still talking about this? The guy has a history.”

“He’s hot. And maybe... if you just wanted to...”

“Don’t continue. I’m not interested in anything superficial. I think I have to repeat...”

“Okay, okay. No bastards, womanizers, or players.”

“Great.”

“But why not have some fun until you find the right guy?”

I sighed. She knew why.

“I’m never letting anyone use me just for sex again. I respect that there are people who enjoy that, but it doesn’t work for me anymore. You know what happened last time.”

“Seven months wasted with a guy who couldn’t be honest with you and didn’t have the guts to say he wasn’t interested in anything more than sex, while you fell deeper and deeper for him.”

“Yeah. I wasted my time. So, enough of this topic.”

“Okay. Sorry.”



It was past ten. It was time to leave. Jack and Zara were already heading out. They were another one of my couples of friends.

What to say about the two of them? Eccentric? Overly romantic? They made my heart warm just watching them. The way Jack treated Zara as the object of all his dedication and affection.

There were also two more couples I saw less often but loved just as much. The most recent of all, Anna’s brother, Jason, and his English girlfriend, Phillipa. And Jack’s brother, Neil, and his also English girlfriend, Rosie, who was a friend of Phillipa.

It was really hard not to feel a little envious of each of these couples' stories, being the only single one in the group. And maybe that’s why I was starting to feel like I was stranded at twenty-seven.

Poking Anna on the couch, I pointed to the empty beer bottles that had accumulated on the coffee table.

“Let’s take them to the kitchen,” I suggested.

“Don’t bother,” Zoe said, slightly tipsy from the drinks, leaning against her husband’s chest on the couch in front of us.

""Don’t worry, we’ll take care of it,"" Ben added.

""Don’t be so nice. We already know you’re not that nice in reality,"" I said, making everyone laugh.

""I’ll help you,"" Ethan said, standing up. ""Anna can focus on figuring out how to get Will home,"" he teased.

I nodded, getting up as well.

""I’m fine. You’ll see that during our run tomorrow,"" Will said, grinning as he pulled Anna closer. ""I’ve still got plenty of energy to burn tonight,"" he insinuated.

""Oh, God!"" I muttered, picking up four bottles, two in each hand.

Zoe and Ben laughed as I headed to the kitchen, hearing Ethan walk behind me, making me uncomfortable.

I really didn’t want to witness the foreplay of two couples.

""Are you sure it’s a good idea to go running with Will tomorrow? The man’s a machine,"" I tried to make conversation, attempting to avoid an awkward silence as I placed the bottles on the kitchen island.

""It wouldn’t be the first time. I’ve known Will for a long time. We’ve done a lot of runs in London during his visits.""

""Of course. You also think it’s normal to wake up before ten on a Sunday to work out. How could I not have noticed?"" I said, sarcastically.

""Don’t you like exercising? I mean... you seem pretty fit to me.""

I tried to ignore the idea that this might be flirting.

""Thanks. I go to the gym whenever work allows. But waking up at seven on a Sunday? I’ll pass,"" I said, turning to look at him, meeting his eyes for the first time since I shook his hand.

Bad idea. The man had a perfect face that made me feel awkward. His jaw seemed to have been sculpted by the gods themselves.

Looking away, I busied myself organizing the bottles he placed on the island, lining them up with mine.

""I see. So, you don’t mind a bit of cardio after ten?"" he asked.

""I guess so.""

""Great, because it’s almost eleven.""

""What?"" I looked up at him, not understanding.

""Looks like we’re the only ones here who won’t be having sex tonight.""

""I think I got lost at the part about cardio after ten, but you’ll get used to it. It’s just part of having only married friends.""

""You really didn’t get what I meant?"" A mischievous smile appeared on his face.

""Should I have? Maybe it’s the alcohol.""

""You said you don’t mind doing cardio after ten... It’s almost eleven, and I have an idea for some cardio we could do together,"" he articulated, making me blink.

""Wait... are you? Did you just meet me and are doing what I think you’re doing?""

""Is that a no?"" He raised an eyebrow.",1,1747133238.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1klis0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1klis0b/any_helpadvice_is_appreciated/,Any Help/Advice is Appreciated,"Hi All, I hope you are well

I am really struggling at the moment. I really, really am. I just feel like the whole universe is against me and always has been. But since March 2024, I've borderline given up entirely

Just a quick summary prior to 2024... I worked at an Academy as a Media Manager and Media Teacher to Sixth Form Students in the UK. I was living a simple life, going to work Monday - Friday and occasionally working weekends at the same workplace for overtime pay. Things were not exactly amazing, but for the first time in my life, from September 2017, when I got employed as the Media Manager to March 2024, I could honestly say things were, 'Ok'

As well as my day job, I also trade on Forex. I have been on/off trading since 2017 and have, overall, been relatively successful and profitable approximately 85% of the time. I use my leftover wages to fund my trading account, but most of the funds are from profit. To increase and maintain my buying power, I would only withdraw when needed. I wanted to keep my trading funds separate to my wage/income after the initial deposit to my broker account

I also use to provide a local computer and laptop repair service for residents in my local area

With my wages, overtime work, trading, and occasional freelance computer repair services, I was earning between £2-£3.5k per month in my mid-20s

My earnings per month went towards standard living expenses to help my Nan, who I lived with, and my Mum and Dad, who lived close by. This arrangement was determined by available space, as my younger brother, who was also working at the time, lived with me and my Nan. He has since moved out to his own place

With everything considered, I was left with approximately £1-£1.2k per month available for myself, investment, and my own bills to pay. Bills coming to approximately £200, I would have, on average £1k available and from that, if I felt it to be necessary, I would add a small amount to my trading account to slowly increase leverage and buying power, in turn, allowing me to make more profit (and potentially, loss)

This was me from maybe mid-2018 to March 2024...

March 1st, 2024, I collapsed at home after waking up in the morning to get ready for work. I dont remember anything from this day or a few days prior to me collapsing. I woke up 2 weeks later in hospital after being put in an induced coma for my own safety.

During these 2 weeks, I had been admitted to the hospital, transferred to another hospital, and then finally moved to a hospital in Central London. When I woke up, I was told i had a 'growth' on my lungs and in the centre of my brain, a small mass in both locations, but they were growing. It was during this time I was diagnosed with Neurosarcoidosis.

I was in hospital from March to the end of September 2024 before I was discharged. I now take medication at home with the help of my parents and Nan due to my memory loss and forgetfulness. I take about 15-20 different tablets a day, and they're all responsible for different things

As well as medicating at home with the prescribed drugs, I also attend treatment at one of the hospitals I stayed at during my time in a coma. Every X amount of weeks, I have a drip session. It's similar to chemotherapy, I'm not entirely sure the difference, but for this, I have to have a fluid administered by needle into my arm for an appropriate amount of time. These sessions vary with time. Every 2 sessions I have, the dosage of the fluid is increased, but the time per session is decreased. So, I would have my first two sessions lasting for approximately 3 hours and a small dosage. My third session would have an increased dosage, but the session would now be 2 hours, 30 minutes, and so on. The time between sessions would also double every 2 sessions. From 4 weeks to 8 weeks. 8 weeks to 16 weeks, etc... until my prescribed 12 sessions were completed. I would then be assessed and reviewed by a team of Dr's and specialists. I am currently waiting for my 6th session out of 12. After every 2 sessions, I am also scheduled for a CRT scan of my brain and lungs to assess progress, if any.

At the time of writing this, I have been told there has been 'minor improvement with the current treatment'

I am now back at home, as mentioned, going back to the hospital on a semi regular basis. But this has massively impacted my normal life... I can no longer go out in public, partly due to a weakened immune system resulting from the drip therapy, unless its for Dr and Hospital appointments and for those I'm driven by either my Mum or Dad. I have been signed off work since the initial collapse back in March 2024 and due to the current time frame up until now, at the time of writing this post, my wages have been reduced down to £380 a month and will soon stop entirely because I've had so much time away from work. I have applied for PIP and was told I would be awarded £1,800 a month based on my previous income whilst working. I received my first PIP benefit at the start of this month, May 2025 however, I was only paid £405 after my claim was reviewed, which my parents are now contesting on my behalf as I don't have the mental capability to do so myself.

Im very depressed. My life was not incredible, but I was happy, I was starting to finally get somewhere, save some money, and add to my previous qualifications. But this whole incident has really put me down mentally. My finances are also starting to take a hit now... my wages from work have stopped completely, so my only income now is from the PIP claim which has been delayed and back under review due to the incorrect payment I received from them, based on the initial notice, I was told I would be paid £1,800 per month, plus an additional lump sum to the agreed value multiplied by the days/months between when the claim was originally made (January 2025) and the first payment. But, after waiting just over 4 months, I only received less than a months claim amount.

Needless to say, my life has taken a massive turn in the last year, and I am so lost and concerned about my future. My work capability and income potential. I wasn't exactly living the life of luxury before this, but at least I was comfortable, both financially and health wise. I also had a good relationship with my family, but since this has happened, I feel like the stress of the situation, on everyone directly involved, is starting to show... there have been many arguments between my parents and Nan over things that relate to me and my health, to trivial things that don't deserve and argument or disagreement, but under the stress and circumstances, this is the stage it's gotten to.

I am not sure what advice I'm looking for exactly... im just asking for any help available from an outside source. All help and advice would and will be much appreciated. Thank you all in advance for taking the time to read my post

Thank you all

A quick note: I've most likely missed out on both crucial and irrelevant information in this post, and I apologise for both. If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer to the best of my abilities.

Im posting this independently and at my own discretion without the help of the inclusion of my family. All viewpoints are my own

Thank you again to everyone who has read this post and who is able to provide some helpful advice

Ultimately, I wish you all a nice day

Edit: I forgot to mention, amongst (probably many) other things i haven't remember, I used to be very active, playing football and going to the gym. I would go to the gym 5 days a week for approximately 90 mins - 2 hour sessions, which always included weight training and finished with a quick hour cardio exercise. I can't do this anymore. With the growth on my lungs, I get out of breath quickly and then a harsh headache to follow. This is the same reason I can no longer play football. The only physical activity or exercise I can do at the moment is short walks

Edit 2: I have short - and long-term memory loss due to the location and pressure the growth is exerting on my brain. I can remember random things at times and then forget them according to my family when speaking to them

Edit 3: I forgot to mention, before this all happened, I took out a loan from the bank to the value of £7,600 to pay and fund various things. I am currently paying this off at a rate of £284 a month. The remaining total is £4,100. I have a direct debit setup to automatically pay towards this

Edit 4: I've gained a lot of weight since going into hospital. Before, when I was active, playing football and going to the gym, I was 55kg, now I'm 104kg. I am eating 3 meals a day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I sometimes snack in between meals, but this would most likely be a bowl of cereal. I rarely eat chocolate or other sweet, sugary foods. I'm mostly eating 2 Weetabix for breakfast and a small - medium portion of fish or chicken at lunch, and for dinner, I will have the alternative food, fish or chicken with salad. I have been told to measure my liquid intake. I'm drinking approximately 3-4 litres of water a day and consuming small amounts of milk and other juices like apple or orange juice in addition to the 3 litres of water. I don't have any caffeine in the form of tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. 

If I think of any additional information, I will add it here in the 'Edit' section. My apologies for what I've missed out initially",1,1747133168.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

It’s when there’s nothing left to scatter in the wind.,"*If you wake up every morning ready to quit but still open Unity or Jira on autopilot — congrats. You’re either one of the few game devs who haven’t been paid for overtime yet… or you’re slowly, steadily burning out. Burnout doesn’t kick the door in — it creeps in. It hides in coffee breaks. Disguises itself as ""just a quick bug fix."" Pretends to be ""just tired"" — and lives rent-free in your head for months.*

*And one day you look at your game and feel… nothing. No excitement. No frustration. Just emptiness. Like your internal engine finally gave up.*

# You forgot why you started

Not all signs of burnout scream ""I can't do this anymore."" Ironically, many people burn out at peak productivity.

Here are some red flags:

* Your work folder is named `final_final_FINAL_v13_this_time_for_real.zip`
* You can’t start anything new — everything feels pointless and derivative
* Your game’s protagonist evokes more emotion than you do
* Scrolling LinkedIn physically hurts
* You’ve stopped playing games altogether
* Your coworkers feel like NPCs stuck in a dialogue loop

If three or more sound familiar — time to hit save and re-evaluate.

# Why you?

Because you’re a game dev or a publisher. Welcome to the industry where:

* The “dream project” becomes “patch thirteen and counting”
* Everyone loves your game — until the first batch of negative reviews
* The eternal cycle: build → fix → patch → explain to marketing why the feature didn’t work like it did in Excel
* “Passion” culture means burning until there’s nothing left

Here, burnout isn’t a bug. It’s an undocumented feature.

# What won’t help

You’ve heard the startup advice. Ignore it:

* Zoom-guided meditations scheduled by your lead
* Switching studios but keeping the same pipeline (with bonus free soda)
* A week off with your laptop “just in case”
* Slapping a ""Work hard, play hard"" sticker on your MacBook like it’s a buff potion

# What actually works

# 1. Make a project that’s pointless on purpose

Build something completely useless and unmarketable. A tea-snail simulator. A visual novel in elvish. Let go of “utility.” Just make.

# 2. Gamify your life

Award yourself XP for small emotional and professional wins. Didn’t snap on that call — +50XP. Refused a late Friday task — +100XP.

# 3. Go hermit mode

Unplugged weekend in the woods with your laptop and some weird ideas. Create what you want — not what sells. Remember what it’s like to feel alive.

# 4. Secret group chat: ""We’re all doomed""

Not for toxicity. Just memes, rants, and voice notes like “my build broke again” — free of judgment.

# 5. Do useless things with other people

Jam with artists, writers, sound designers. Not for a deadline. For the chaos. Make things like kids do — without goals, without plans.

# The Exit Is Not Through the Door

Burnout isn’t a collapse. It’s a slow fade — where motivation turns to drone mode. No vacation alone will fix it. But noticing it early? That’s a start.

You’re not just a cog. You’re a world-builder. A coder of experiences. A shaper of stories. Don’t forget to live in your own.

If you’ve made it this far — that means you’ve still got something left in the tank. Protect it. Don’t waste it on anyone who says ""Game dev is just fun and games.

The menu before her seemed to blur, the words dancing on the paper like elusive shadows. The soft hum of conversation inside the hushed ambiance of the Japanese restaurant enveloped Sofia like a cocoon. For a few minutes, the room felt almost suffocating.  
""Where did you get these?"" she asked, her gaze landing once again on the images of her boyfriend and elder sister together on the balcony of a hotel, kissing each other. A part of her was certain these were photoshopped.  
After all, her sister Charlotte Lockhart had been very good to her, supporting her in everything. Why would she betray her trust? Moreover, Sofia’s boyfriend Daniel Beaumont had been with her for four years. Why would he suddenly betray the trust she gave him? This didn’t make sense.  
""You can check the dates, time, and location behind each photo,"" the man across from her answered. She quickly turned the photos around, and just like he said, the information she was looking for was indeed scribbled behind each image.  
""Mr. Beaumont, you must understand that this information is..."" Her lips trembled as her gaze landed on Mr. Alexander Beaumont, Daniel’s older brother and the current CEO of Beaumont Empire. ""Too much to handle.""  
She felt a tightness in her throat and a drumming in her temples.  
""Having doubts despite all the evidence is normal,"" Alexander’s lips quirked up as he mused. ""I would understand it if you have the photos checked for authenticity."" Amusement flashed in his dark brown eyes.  
She nodded. Again, her eyes landed on the photos. Without saying another word, she placed the photos back in the brown envelope and carefully stowed them inside her bag.  
""Then may I know what Mr. Beaumont wants?"" Sofia said. This made her confused as she had actually only met Mr. Beaumont once, and that was during a Christmas dinner two years ago. Despite being Daniel’s older brother, Alexander Beaumont buried himself in work. This man had been a well-known workaholic who missed his younger brother’s birthday for four consecutive years. Yet, out of nowhere, he would suddenly meet her. Why? Was it simply because he wanted to tell her about the photos?  
Without saying a word, Mr. Beaumont signaled his secretary, who was standing behind him. The secretary then handed another folder to Sofia. She opened it without asking questions. She understood that Mr. Beaumont was a man of few words.  
She quickly read the documents inside the folder, and almost immediately, her expression changed. ""M— Marriage of Convenience?"" She almost could not believe what she was reading. Mr. Beaumont wanted to marry her?  
""Read the rest…""  
Sofia bit her lower lip as her green eyes glazed over the entire document until she finally reached the last part that informed her this was but a temporary arrangement.  
""Mr. Beaumont, I am your brother’s woman,"" she uttered as her heart raced against her chest. What was this man doing?  
""Cheating brother,"" he added.  
""I have yet to confirm this,"" she steadied her voice as she slowly comforted herself. There is still a high chance that Mr. Beaumont was lying and that the images were photoshopped. She convinced herself that this might just be another scheme.  
Again, without saying a word, he pushed what looked like a black card her way. She stared at it and realized it was a hotel key card.  
""What is this?""  
""It would take time to confirm the photos so Mr. Beaumont arranged for you, Miss Lockhart, to confirm the matters with your own eyes. This is the flight that Mr. Beaumont arranged for Miss Lockhart, as well as the accommodation and transportation. You will be checking into the same hotel as Mr. Daniel and Miss Charlotte are staying.""  
Sofia could not contain her emotion as she accepted the things that Mr. Beaumont’s secretary handed. Daniel was currently not in Springfield; he was at a conference in LA. Meanwhile, Charlotte should be somewhere in Texas, wrapping up her taping for her current film.  
""Let us have this conversation again once Miss Lockhart has confirmed everything,"" Mr. Beaumont got up. ""If you want to change a few things in the contract, please feel free to call my personal number.""  
He placed another card on the table between them and then started walking away.  
""Why me?"" she asked as he took his first step away. Mr. Beaumont could marry anyone. Literally, anyone. Yet, he would suddenly choose to propose a marriage of convenience to his younger brother’s girlfriend? Why?  
He turned around, and without an iota of emotion on his face, he stared at her for a few seconds before he said, ""Business.""  
Then he turned around and left the restaurant.  
Once again, her gaze trembled. She wanted to ask more questions, but her mind could not seem to think straight. The next thing Sofia knew, she was already on the first-class flight to LA.  
It was already the dead of night when she arrived at Long Beach Airport. With just her bag, she quickly boarded the transportation that Mr. Beaumont set up for her. At this point, Sofia did not even know what she was doing a thousand miles away from home. A part of her wanted to know the truth. She knew the truth would devastate her, but she had to know what had been going on behind her back.  
Not long after, she arrived at the Ritz and proceeded to check into a suite room that Mr. Beaumont arranged. Apparently, this room is located just next to where Daniel and Charlotte were staying. The weight of uncertainty pressed down on her as she stepped into the lavish suite.  
Sitting on the large King-size bed inside the room, Sofia immediately sent a text to Daniel, asking him about his day. Just as she expected, there was no response even after thirty minutes.  
Unable to stop herself, she got up and got out of her room. Then she turned on the video on her phone and used the hotel key card that Mr. Beaumont gave her earlier to access the room.  
The door seamlessly opened. For a while, Sofia stood in front of the door, wondering what she was doing.  
Then she straightened her back and walked inside the room. She chose not to turn the lights on and instead used a small flashlight that she bought from the airport.  
Quickly, Sofia realized that no one was inside. After a quick tour, Sofia concluded that a couple was inside this room. However, a part of her was still doubtful, hoping that the evidence was all planted, arranged in advance for her.  
The other part was, of course, devastated.  
However, she steeled herself. There was no point in backing down. She came here for the truth, and she was prepared to find out what it was. Just as she thought of checking the luggage stored on the luggage rack, she heard a hiss. Then all the lights inside the room turned on.  
Whoever it was that was occupying this room… just arrived.  
  
Chapter 2  
Sofia's heart raced like a wild horse, pounding against her chest as if trying to escape its bony cage. The closet felt small around her and she quickly closed her eyes.  
Sofia’s trembling hands clutched her phone. The video was on, recording whatever it was that was happening outside of the closet.  
“I told you not to drink,” Charlotte's voice, usually warm and comforting, cut through the stifling silence, a mixture of disappointment and concern lacing her words.  
“What are you so angry about? Didn’t I just come back to the hotel with you?” Daniel's voice followed. His words echoed like distant thunder, each syllable crashing against her senses. In an attempt to stifle a gasp, she covered her mouth with trembling hands, her fingers barely managing to muffle the sound of her disbelief.  
From the small gap in the closet, she could see Charlotte who was trying to remove her clothes.  
“Let me help you,” Daniel quickly helped her pull the zipper down before he moved her long blond hair to the side and kissed her neck while hugging her from behind.  
Sofia was certain she heard her heartbreak. A searing pain gripped her chest, squeezing her heart. This was not a show. This was real. Mr. Beaumont wasn’t lying.  
“Shall we bathe together?” Daniel asked.  
“You smell bad…” Charlotte said she pouted as she batted her beautiful eyes. “I told you not to drink. You know how I dislike that smell. Aw!” Charlotte suddenly screamed when Daniel poked her side. “What— Hey— stop— stop tickling— I am still on my heels! Ah!”  
Out of nowhere, Daniel carried Charlotte into his arms and placed her on the bed. Using his elbow to support his weight, he lay on top of her.  
“Do you still dislike how I smell?” he smirked. Sofia could hear that sweetness in his voice. She closed her eyes in an attempt to block out the rest, but it was useless.  
“Hmph! Stop acting cute. You’re not.”  
“Really?”  
“Really!” Charlotte pouted as she batted her beautiful blue eyes. “And you lied to me. You said we would stay here for a week.”  
“The meeting is only for three days, Sofia would know.”  
“You already spend most of your time with her at home. What’s wrong with spending a few days with me? Aren’t you leaving her soon?”  
Sofia almost dropped her phone when she heard Charlotte’s words. W— What is she talking about? The raw and visceral pain that threatened to consume her seemed to stop.  
It was as if a cold bucket of water was poured into her soul.  
What was Charlotte talking about?  
At one point, she was tempted to barge into their bedroom and confront them. However, she could not do it now. No. She would not do something that might put her in jail.  
She gritted her teeth as she forced herself to listen.  
“She’s to turn 26 very soon,” Daniel chuckled. “You know I cannot leave without you, right?” He started kissing her neck as his other hand started moving on her body, caressing, pinching, stroking.  
“She has yet to promise you that she would give you her shares even if you have yet to marry. How confident are you that she would hand you the shares without conditions attached?” Charlotte asked.  
“Can we stop talking about something irrelevant?” Again, he peppered Charlotte with kisses, causing the latter to giggle.  
“I am getting impatient, Daniel. I have been waiting for two years.”  
Two years?  
Sofia could no longer stop the tears that welled in her eyes. Two years? Daniel and Charlotte had been sleeping for two years? The truth of their betrayal unfurled inside her like a black banner.  
Sofia grabbed her chest. It felt as If a dagger was in her heart, a blunt dagger that was slowly turning, slowly destroying her from the inside.  
“Her birthday’s in a month, babe,” Daniel reminded Charlotte.  
“I know… I just…” Before she could finish her words, Daniel suddenly showed her a velvet box.  
“You— “  
Then, Daniel helped her sit down on the bed.  
“A ring? You— “  
“Will you marry me?” Daniel asked. “Of course, after I get the shares.”  
For a few minutes, Charlotte stared at the ring, her mouth agape. Then tears welled up in her eyes. Without saying a word, she hugged Daniel and pushed him down the bed.  
The next thing that Sofia saw was something that she found very hard to process.  
Tears flowed down her cheeks as she closed her eyes and covered her mouth, afraid that they would hear her sobs. Each moment felt like a succession of merciless blows towards Sofia’s already shattered heart.  
Soon, she felt like a fog had descended in her head. She could no longer remember how she left the room. The next thing she knew, she was already outside of the door. She quickly ran into her own room. The moment she closed her door, the storm within her broke into stifled sobs.  
Betrayal, heartbreak, and the overwhelming sense of loss clung to her as she sat on the carpeted floor, crying.  
The next day arrived with the persistence of the sun as its rays sliced through the room. Sofia stirred on the bed, her eyelids heavy. The memory of the previous night’s torment immediately filled her head.  
“Awake?” a deep voice interrupted her hazy thoughts. She jolted up, her face pale as she looked around and found a familiar man sitting next to her bed.  
Alexander Beaumont.  
He was wearing a black suit, and his hair brushed up, showing his sharp and intimidating features. For a while, his steady dark brown eyes met her green eyes.  
She frowned.  
“Why are you here?” She struggled to move, her head throbbed, and her arms felt weak.  
Damn Hangover, she thought inwardly.  
It took her a while to realize that she was wearing her underwear. She had spent the whole night drinking and crying. In the end, she fell asleep while thinking about taking a shower. She quickly pulled the sheets up to cover her body.  
“Business,” he answered, his gaze serious. “Shall we talk?”  
  
Chapter 3  
“I have yet to make up my mind,” Sofia said, her eyes narrowing her eyes at him. Did he come because of his proposition?  
The enticing aroma of freshly baked croissants wafted through the air, causing her stomach to growl involuntarily.  
She stole a glance at the tempting spread, attempting to feign indifference to both the food and the audible protest of her hungry stomach. It was a futile effort.  
“Is there a need for such pretense?” Alexander's inquiry cut through the air, devoid of sympathy. “Eat your fill. I only came to make sure that you did not murder anyone. My plans would not succeed when you are in prison.”  
Blunt, Sofia acknowledged inwardly, her attention reluctantly shifting from the tantalizing croissants to the man seated across from her. She picked up her fork and began to mechanically spear a piece of brunch, attempting to divert her focus away from Alexander's words.  
“LH Group will hold its annual shareholder’s meeting, and in this meeting, your stepfather will blame you for the mishaps. Not directly, of course.”  
“W— What?” The cup of coffee in her hand trembled, threatening to spill. His words demanded her full attention, taking all the heaviness and headache from her hangover.  
LH Design was the subsidiary of LH Group. Currently, she is the Head Designer of LH Design and its acting CEO. Before she could continue thinking about this, Alexander pushed another document her way. She opened it without asking any more questions.  
“This— “  
“A plagiarism scandal ready to explode,” Alexander interrupted, delivering the revelation with a cool matter-of-factness.  
“I made those designs…” Sofia's voice wavered. How could it be plagiarism? She spent countless nights drawing them, choosing the materials carefully for the upcoming collection.  
He didn’t answer. He studied her appearance, his eyes confident yet something about it contained cruelty that made her uncomfortable.  
“A rich heiress who grew up with a silver spoon against a working woman who struggled to make ends meet. Who do you think the media will believe?” he asked, his voice cutting through her like a sharp knife.  
“What are you trying to say? Why would my father— “  
“Stepfather,” he corrected her.  
Sofia’s lips trembled. She steadied herself. Her mother married her stepfather when she was just two years old. Her biological father died when her mother was pregnant, and the only father that she knew was her stepfather, Lawrence Miles.  
Charlotte was Lawrence’s daughter from his first marriage. She was only a few months older than Sofia. Because of this, the two always treated each other like sisters.  
“You should already know what I was talking about, no?” he asked. This time, Sofia did not answer. She only stared at the document as she thought of what she heard last night.  
Her 26th birthday was coming. This meant that her trust fund and inheritance from her late grandfather would belong to her. Shares, stocks, bonds, properties, and at least three hundred million dollars. The inheritance was something that every Lockhart would get once they came of age.  
However, to get this inheritance, some conditions must be met. She did not tell Daniel about these conditions, as this had been kept a secret by the Lockhart Family. She did not intend to tell him anything about this matter either.  
However, after what she witnessed last night, she was convinced that Daniel knew about the conditions, and that was why he wanted to keep her around despite sleeping with Sofia’s sister.  
“The shares…” she mumbled. There can only be one reason why her stepfather would create a scandal like this. It was to taint her name. He wanted to show the board that the heiress of LH Group is a plagiarizing ass. This would surely affect how they view Sofia.  
“Smart,” he smirked.  
“My father— Lawrence would never do something like this.” She said. However, a part of her already doubted her own words. She grew up with Lawrence, and he treated her like family all this time.  
“Just like how your sister would never betray your trust?” he asked.  
That hurt. Must he add fuel to the fire? She was not sure if he was making fun of her. The funny thing was, that he was only stating facts. She swallowed in response. What happened last night was enough of a wake-up call for Sofia.  
She had been too lenient.  
No. That was not leniency. It was stupidity.  
How did she not notice that Daniel had been cheating on her? How did she not notice that every time Daniel has a conference or a business meeting, Charlotte would magically have a photoshoot or a film too?  
How? Was she truly that stupid?  
She flipped through the document in her hand as if her stomach hadn’t just growled earlier. To her surprise, there were other things included in the document. Again, there were images. However, unlike the images that he gave her earlier, this one was that of her stepfather.  
“This woman…”  
“Lawrence's ex, and Charlotte’s mother, Lianne Ramirez.”  
As far as Sofia knew, Charlotte's mother abandoned her right after giving birth. She left and never came back. Lawrence quickly assumed all the responsibility and became a single father. Was it all a lie?  
She swallowed. Over the years, Sofia started calling Lawrence, father.  
She flipped through the images and soon found something even more concerning. It was Lianne, Lawrence with someone wearing large shades that covered her beautiful face— It was Charlotte!  
So Charlotte was already seeing her biological mother? She turned the card and saw the dates. This was a year ago! Did Charlotte know about Lianne and Lawrence’s relationship since a year ago?  
The next photos answered her questions.  
The images were of three talking and even vacationing in a tropical country.  
“What about my mother?” she mumbled. If Lawrence and Charlotte had been acting like this for a while now then… what about her mother who was currently staying in a medical facility because of some personal issues?  
“Are you seeing everything now?” he asked. Then he leaned forward. “Everything has been planned. It was a deliberate scheme.”  
Sofia opened her mouth; she wanted to argue, perhaps ask for more evidence, but the more she thought about the proof in front of her, the colder she got. In the end, she closed her mouth without saying another word.  
“Unfortunately, I cannot prove that what happened to your mother was deliberate. Whoever did it covered their tracks very well.” Alexander leaned back, a languid smile on his face.  
She nodded. She cannot exactly let him do everything. “So you wanted to marry me to get my shares of Beaumont Empire?” she asked. Alexander Beaumont was a well-known bachelor. There had been rumors of him having various kinds of relationships, but all would disappear in a day or two.  
“It is not a bad deal, isn’t it?” he asked.  
She wet her lips. Daniel wanted to marry her because he wanted her eight percent shares of the Beaumont Empire. Their reasons for marrying were almost the same, except that Alexander was using a rather direct approach.  
“Marrying me would not only devastate Daniel but… would solidify your position as the heiress of LH Group. It’s a win—win."" He said as he reached out to his cup and slowly enjoyed his coffee.  
“A marriage of convenience, huh…” Sofia said.  
“The perfect one,” he responded, the side of his lips quirking up into another smirk.  
  
Chapter 4  
Sofia sank into her personally customized white ornate chair, her attention fixed on the wisps of steam dancing above the coffee resting on the table before her.  
Despite her role as the creative director of a fashion company, Sofia's office radiated simplicity that bordered on plainness. The color scheme was stark—black and white, meticulously organized to maintain a sense of order. It was intentional, reflecting her desire for clarity and focus in her workspace.  
She closed her eyes, exhaustion was gnawing on her soul. In the past two days, she had mostly spent her time crying and being miserable. When is the pain going to ease?  
Suddenly, noisy sounds came out of the laptop. She immediately ran towards her laptop and turned it on. Earlier, with the help of Alexander, she got to know Lawrence and COO of the company arranged a secret meeting. So she managed to slip a small voice recorder on the lapel of Lawrence's coat. It was something that Alexander generously provided to help her make up her mind—something that she found rather abominable yet quite useful.  
He thought it would be quite useful and it seems that he was right.  
""How was it?"" Lawrence asked. At this time, the two were already in the car.  
""Everything has been prepared… I have acquired some sketches."" Mr. Oh said. One could easily hear the chuckle that followed his words. ""And her?"" he asked.  
""Still clueless…"" Lawrence responded. ""Daniel already agreed to propose to her on her birthday. Convincing her not to sign any prenup should be easy for him. When the time comes…"" Lawrence did not continue his words, but Sofia heard a clinking sound on the other side.  
Were they toasting to their future success?  
Sofia's lips trembled inwardly. The sadness that she felt earlier seemed to vanish. What replaced it was pure rage and hatred.  
""You should call Doctor Mulach and tell him to increase the dosage,"" Lawrence's voice echoed inside Sofia’s head like a bell tolling over and over again. ""She cannot wake up now.""  
""Understood…"" Mr. Oh answered. Once again, Sofia heard a chuckle.  
Unable to continue listening to their conversation, Sofia got up and stared at the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows of her office. Doctor Mulach is currently the head doctor in charge of her mother’s well-being. Since Eunice lost consciousness two years ago, Doctor Mulach had been the one in charge of her treatment.  
Sofia had trusted him as he was a well-known doctor both abroad and in the US. Who would have thought that he was harming her very own mother instead of healing her?  
Who would have thought that Sofia would be so stupid to believe everyone around her?  
She clenched her jaw, her gaze narrowed at the cars that she could see from where she was standing. Her heart raced against her chest as she forced herself to calm down. Closing her eyes, Sofia was not able to stop a single tear from falling into her cheeks.  
Indeed. Being betrayed by the people that she trusted the most was worse than being stabbed by an enemy.  
A chuckle escaped her lips as she took her phone and dialed a number.  
""What took you so long?"" Mr. Beaumont’s deep and sexy voice answered just after a ring. Sofia closed her eyes, she then bit her lower lip. Then she said. “Let’s get married.”",1,1747132968.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1klimio,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1klimio/kendu_cryptos_next_evolution/,$KENDU- Crypto’s next evolution!,"Memecoins used to be a fun and unique side of the crypto industry. Coins that barely or didn’t have any utility, coins that were created for or by a meme and rode their humorous aspect all the way to the stars. 

Unfortunately memecoins have turned into something dark. Coins created with one reason only, to make a quick buck over someone else’s back. 
From the obvious rug pulls to honeypot’s and every other scam in between. To the coins that aren’t direct scams but use techniques like market manipulation to lure new investors in, only to dump on them and take their money. 
On top of that stories of traders making millions lures new investors in.
Memecoins have turned into a sea of gambles, where it’s almost impossible to win. Most of the time you’re better off going to the casino. A far stretch from what they were once meant to be. They have always been a risk investment (obviously), just not one where you couldn’t win.

Fortunately not everything can always be bad! There are definitely successful memecoins out there, just take a look at a few of the giants, $Doge,$Shib or $Pepe for example.
So what made these coins successful?
They didn’t use KOL’s, didn’t use market makers, basically they didn’t do any bullshit!
They had one thing only, and that’s a community! 
Not one just there hoping for a pump to make a quick buck. A community that believed in who they were and what they stood for, Even when nobody else did!
Their choice to stay organic and use their community to build themselves to the top is what got them there and let them stay there. 

$KENDU is walking the same path the memecoins giant’s did. But we aren’t here just to walk in their footsteps, we’re here to go beyond where they did, push boundaries further than they have ever been pushed. 
And we have the community to do it!
We are filled with people working tirelessly to make $KENDU succeed. You literally won’t find a harder working community than us! 
We work so hard we get questions if we are using bots to do it! Which we don’t, i can 100% assure you every post, every comment is a real person!
Although with our massive output on the socials i  can understand the confusion :)

Our insane output on the socials, although impressive isn’t what differentiates us from the others. 
What does differentiate $KENDU from all the others is our active IRL expansion!
This is what makes $KENDU not a memecoin but a brand! 
We’re the first to do so and with that we are writing crypto history!

Just a few of the products we have so far:
- Kendu energy, Yes, you read that right, we have our own energy drinks. Included in this is also Kendu street, which produces Kendu merchandise. https://kenduenergy.com
- Kendu coffee, If energy drinks aren’t your thing Kendu coffee is the option for you!  https://kenducoffee.com
- Kendu games, Yes, there is a Kendu game in the works, powered by a AAA developer! Isn’t that amazing? x.comhttps://x.comKendu Games (@KenduGames) / X
- Kendu created, which allows you free acces to blueprint’s to create your own Kendu mask! https://kenducreator.com

These are just a few of the many projects the $KENDU community is working on! 
The creativity and raw dedication of this community is unmatched!

If that wasn’t enough to convince you here are some $Kendu stats:
- We are the second memecoin to reach 50k votes needed for a free Certik audit. (First was $PEPE) Talk about a community!
- Certik rates our community 98/100👀. Other larger memecoins are in the 70’s 
- We currently have 18k holders which is insane for our size. Previous ATH happened with 3.5k, Talk about distribution!
- Our top 100 wallets only hold 48% of the supply. This includes LP addresses which ofcourse naturally inflate this number! Pretty crazy for our size! (This is better than coins close to 1B MC.
- We’re active on 3 chains, ETH, SOL and Base. 
- We recently cleanly broke out of a year long downtrend. This allowed Kendu to build the strongest foundation of any current memecoin. The only was is up now!

$KENDU isn’t just a memecoin like all the others. We’re redefining what a memecoin could and should be, which funnily enough isn’t even a memecoin, it’s a brand!
We’re writing history! We are the next evolution!

Check out our Website (https://www.kendu.io), our subreddit (r/KenduInu_Ecosystem), and especially our Telegram! ( Link can be found on our website).
Lurk around for a bit with us, see what we’re all about, feel what true community feels like!
At Kendu we encourage a work culture but we aren’t forcing anyone to do anything! You should be inspired to work, not forced! You’re welcome to just chill if you’d like, although any amount of work is appreciated, even just a like or an upvote!
We’d be happy to have you join the pack!

We don’t gamble, we work! $KENDU.

**Chapter 1 Meeting the Holbrooks**



Rosaline's POV:  
  
My name is Rosaline Sinclair. I'm a 20-year-old werewolf and the Alpha of the Shadow Pack. Yes, you read that correctly—I'm an Alpha, one of the rare female Alphas on the Werewolf Continent.  
  
Not long ago, the Shadow Pack was one of the most influential packs on the continent. But after I was born, my grandfather led us into seclusion in Frostmoore, the northernmost part of the continent. He claimed that our ancestors' first werewolf king came from here and that Frostmoore was our homeland.  
  
Frostmoore was far from the bustling centers of the continent, and over the years, the outside world has learned less and less about our pack. Apart from us, no other pack knows that I've inherited the Alpha position from Hubert Sinclair, my grandfather.  
  
My parents died when I was young. They were victims of the territorial wars between the larger packs. From an early age, I knew that protecting the Shadow Pack would be my lifelong duty.  
  
Fortunately, the Moon Goddess blessed me with a strong and agile body. I began my werewolf training by the time I was six, and my skills surpassed those of my peers.  
  
Once I was able to control my wolf, my grandfather was quick to pass the Alpha title to me. He said he was tired and ready to retire, to enjoy a peaceful life.  
  
Normally, I would handle the pack's matters in Shadow Pack, but here I am, standing at the Rivemon train station.  
  
It's almost laughable. It wasn't until I became an Alpha that my grandfather told me about an arranged marriage I couldn't refuse. The groom-to-be was none other than Caden Holbrook, the first heir to the Eclipse Pack.  
  
""Just three months,"" my grandfather pleaded.  
  
""Please, just three months. Can you do that for me? You have to understand. If something happens to me and your destined mate isn't strong enough, those elders will make your life miserable. That's why I arranged this marriage with Eclipse Pack 18 years ago.""  
  
I protested. ""Grandpa, everyone in the pack respects me. Who would dare challenge me as I'm the first female Alpha of the Shadow Pack?""  
  
My grandfather knew how strong I was. He'd said my power exceeded that of my father's.  
  
But clearly, my parents' death had shaken my grandfather's belief in the continuation of the family legacy.  
  
Rather than letting the Moon Goddess decide my fated mate, my grandfather preferred to find a strong Alpha from a powerful pack to rely on. That way, he believed I would be better equipped to handle internal conflicts within the pack and protect our people, rather than facing it alone.  
  
""You can come back if you don't have any feelings for that boy from the Holbrooks after three months. We'll break off the engagement then,"" my grandfather said.  
  
I agreed, not just out of duty but also out of concern for my grandfather's health. After he passed the mantle to me, his powers had diminished, and his body had begun to fail him. I didn't want him to continue worrying about me. Three months was nothing; I could endure it.  
  
As soon as I stepped off the platform with my suitcase, I noticed several people glancing my way.  
  
I had dressed as simply as I could—wearing a white T-shirt and jeans with my slightly curly hair tied back with a band. I had purposely suppressed the powerful Alpha aura of my wolf, Freya, trying to pass as an Omega.  
  
Still, my beauty couldn't be hidden.  
  
""Excuse me, are you Ms. Sinclair from the Shadow Pack? Welcome to Rivemon. I'm your driver, sent by the Eclipse Pack.""  
  
I nodded. It seemed Eclipse Pack didn't place much importance on their ""future Luna,"" sending only a driver to pick me up. Fine by me—I wanted to keep a low profile and hide my strength.  
  
I only wanted to get out of this arranged marriage as soon as possible.  
  
I followed the driver to the car, and as we left the train station, I could feel his eyes glancing at me through the rearview mirror.  
  
I closed my eyes, knowing it was natural for him to be curious. Though I appeared to be a low-ranking Omega, I was here to be Eclipse Pack's Luna.  
  
The Shadow Pack was powerful, but the surrounding packs always watched us closely.  
  
While my time here might be short, no one needed to learn the Alpha was absent from our pack. That's why my grandfather had urged me to hide my identity. Aside from Richard Holbrook, the current Alpha of the Eclipse Pack, no one in the Eclipse Pack knew the truth.  
  
Caden, the first heir of Eclipse Pack, was a 20-year-old prodigy who managed the pack's business affairs with impressive skill, turning everything he touched into success within a year.  
  
However, just like me, he probably never imagined that his Alpha father had arranged a marriage for him with a rural girl from the far-off Frostmoore.  
  
The driver must have noticed my simple clothes because I saw him shake his head in disapproval.  
  
As an Alpha with heightened senses, I could easily tell what the driver was thinking. He probably saw me as just another nobody from the Shadow Pack's Sinclair family. He likely thought of me as a Cinderella trying to marry into a rich family, unsure of the hardships I'd face once I entered the Holbrooks' world.  
  
I shrugged off his judgment and sent a message to my grandfather. His reply came almost immediately, ""Ok.""  
  
The car soon pulled up to the Holbrook Manor. The driver helped me with my luggage, and we made our way to the front door, only to be stopped by a woman standing at the entrance.  
  
She sized me up disdainfully.  
  
The driver immediately lowered his head. ""Mrs. Holbrook, she's ... ""  
  
""Laura,"" the woman interrupted, her voice dripping with distaste.  
  
""Yes, Mrs. Holbrook.""  
  
Laura, the housekeeper, holding a bottle of disinfectant, started spraying me from head to toe.  
  
Eleanor Holbrook, standing by her side, added coldly, ""Don't forget the shoes and the hair—everything must be sanitized.""  
  
It didn't take a genius to figure it out. Eleanor was definitely Caden's mother, and she seemed to be trying to intimidate me, her future daughter-in-law.  
  
A sharp, chemical scent filled the air, and I instinctively blocked my face with my hand. I glared at Eleanor and said, ""You guys are sick.""  
  
Eleanor's expression immediately soured. ""As expected of a bumpkin from the Frostmoore. You're rude. We're concerned that you might carry wolfsbane. What if you harm someone in the Holbrook family?""  
  
I knew hiding my Alpha aura and pretending to be an Omega was the right move. Eleanor's reaction proved it—she was just a shallow, status-obsessed woman.  
  
*She didn't like my attitude? Fine, I didn't like hers either.*  
  
""Maybe you should also spray some disinfectant on your mouth. It stinks ... "" I said, brushing past her to step inside.  
  
Behind me, I heard Eleanor sputter, ""You!""  
  
""Mrs. Holbrook, please don't get upset over a bumpkin like her,"" I heard Laura say, quickly trying to placate her.  
  
I walked further into the house and almost immediately bumped into a girl standing in my way. She was about my age, dressed head-to-toe in expensive designer clothes, and her eyes gleamed with cold disapproval.  
  
""So, you're Rosaline from the Shadow Pack? The one who's supposed to be Caden's Luna?"" she asked, her voice dripping with disdain. ""How could you be an Omega?""  
  
She sniffed the air, then glanced over my clothes with even more scorn. ""Tsk tsk, Grandpa really has poor taste. I heard you took a train here. If we'd known, we could've bought you a plane ticket. But I guess Frostmoore doesn't have an airport, huh?""  
  
She giggled, basking in her superiority.  
  
I stared at her, unimpressed. She must be Queenie Holbrook, Caden's cousin. Only someone as socially inept as she was would dare criticize Alpha Richard's judgment.  
  
*Is everyone from the Eclipse Pack this arrogant?*  
  
On the way here, I had already researched everything about Rivemon and the Eclipse Pack. However, from Eleanor and Queenie's attitudes, it was clear that this newly risen pack knew nothing about the Shadow Pack.  
  
*Buy me a plane ticket? Please. Do they have any idea who I am?*  
  
I own three private jets.  
  
I only took the train to keep a low profile, though my grandfather had rented an entire train for me to travel in comfort.  
  
I doubt anyone could imagine the pleasure of having an entire train to myself. During the trip, I even shifted into wolf form and let Freya run freely through the empty carriages.  
  
I couldn't be bothered to waste time talking to Queenie. Grabbing my suitcase, I headed upstairs without another word.  
  
Behind me, I heard footsteps. Freya told me it was Queenie, and she was glaring at me angrily as her pride was hurt by being ignored.  
  
""Where's my room?"" I asked one of the servants.  
  
Before the servant could answer, Queenie stepped forward and spoke up.  
  
""Right here,"" she said, opening the door. ""You must've never stayed in such a big, luxurious room before. You'd better cherish your time at Eclipse Pack. I'm Caden's cousin, Queenie. You'd better be nice to me. Who knows, maybe—""  
  
Before she could finish her sentence, I simply walked into the room and slammed the door shut behind me. The loud bang made her jump and she almost shifted her form.  
  
""Ah! How dare a bumpkin like her be so arrogant? I just want to rip her apart. What kind of taste does Grandpa have anyway?""  
  
I leaned against the door, trying to stifle my laughter as I listened to Queenie's complaints outside.  
  
*Do you think you can hurt me?*  
  
*You're a Beta, a lowly Beta. Freya could tear you apart with one swipe of her claws.*



**Chapter 2 She Cured My Insomnia**



Caden's POV:  
  
To sharpen my skills, the Alpha of the Eclipse Pack handed over all the pack's responsibilities and the management of the company's capital expansion to me long before I was officially in charge.  
  
As the heir, it was my duty, but what the hell was this sudden arranged marriage about?  
  
Before I knew it, she had actually arrived at my home.  
  
D\*mn it, my fated mate was supposed to be ""her,"" and definitely not some unknown girl from the Shadow Pack.  
  
I didn't understand my grandfather's decision. He knew that werewolves always had a destined mate, yet 18 years ago, he made a promise with his old friend, Hubert, to arrange this marriage.  
  
The girl, Rosaline, was here. My grandfather had been calling me all afternoon, urging me to go pick her up, but I'd been deliberately delaying, making excuses. In the end, I heard that he sent one of the family drivers to fetch her.  
  
I wasn't interested in a pack from the extreme north like Frostmoore. I would get out of this arranged marriage sooner or later.  
  
I had been busy all day, and by the time I returned home, it was already past midnight.  
  
Managing the pack was exhausting, and I had drunk quite a bit of wine with dinner. My wolf, Edward, was urging me to sleep, so I hastily took a shower and collapsed into bed.  
  
The soft mattress felt heavenly, but suddenly, I realized someone was in the bed with me.  
  
In the dark, I couldn't see her face, but I could tell she was a woman.  
  
I froze, then before I could react, the woman turned over and pulled me into an embrace, murmuring, ""Teddy, be good, it's time to sleep.""  
  
I was completely still.  
  
*Why did this feel so ... right?*  
  
Her scent was faint, but it was so familiar. It was a fragrance that pierced my senses, tugging at something deep inside me.  
  
She smelled just like her ...  
  
Edward didn't respond. At that moment, I couldn't tell if it was the alcohol or something else, but I couldn't resist holding her close.  
  
I closed my eyes, letting sleep take over.  
  
How long had it been since I'd slept so deeply? Ten years?  
  
In my dream, I saw the image again.  
  
In the small, dark room, a young girl's tiny body curled around me. Her soft voice whispered, ""Don't be afraid. I'm strong. I'll protect you.""  
  
I dreamt about her again. I wondered if she knew that I'd been searching for her for ten years.  
  
I hugged her tightly, and she smiled, holding me just as tightly in return. The sensation of being in her arms was so real and comforting.  
  
Morning came too soon. A rapid knock on the door jolted me awake.  
  
""Caden, breakfast is ready. Don't you have a morning meeting? Get up!""  
  
I rubbed my eyes, groggy from sleep. Queenie's voice came from the other side of the door.  
  
That was odd—Queenie never woke me up.  
  
She seemed anxious, and I wondered what had made her so worked up this early.  
  
Suddenly, I noticed something felt off. There was a faint, lingering scent in the air, and my arms felt warm and soft. I could feel strands of hair tangled around my neck.  
  
*Who was I holding?*  
  
I shot up, my mind clearing instantly. As I turned, I was met with a pair of large light brown eyes, just as shocked as I was.  
  
She quickly scrambled out of my arms, and I could finally see her face. She was a natural beauty.  
  
She was wearing only a thin nightgown, and she pointed at me, asking, ""Who are you?""  
  
It didn't take long for me to recognize her. My grandfather had shown me her picture before. The moment I realized who she was, my gaze darkened, and my face soured as I glared at the audacity of this woman.  
  
""Rosaline?""  
  
Her expression shifted from shock to indifference. She must have figured out who I was too.  
  
*How had my so-called fiancée ended up in my bed?*  
  
I couldn't help but laugh coldly. ""You tried to seduce me the moment you arrived at the Holbrooks? Hah. The women of the Shadow Pack sure are bold.""  
  
Rosaline looked at me blankly, as if considering my question.  
  
The rules of Eclipse Pack were strict. As a guest and my fiancée, Rosaline should have been staying in the guest room. Seeing her here, it was obvious she'd either been set up or was trying to seduce me like some sort of prostitute.  
  
Rosaline stood up and said coldly, ""First of all, I didn't seduce you. Queenie told me yesterday that this was my room. Mr. Holbrook, I'm not interested in you in the slightest.  
  
""Second, I was already asleep when you came back last night. Didn't you notice someone else in your bed? You held me while I slept, so how do you explain that? Could it be you've had your eye on me all along?""  
  
Queenie was still knocking outside the door.  
  
I had a pretty good idea of what had happened. What she said was true, and I couldn't argue. But the coldness in her tone irked me.  
  
I narrowed my eyes and studied her closely. Rosaline's large light brown eyes really did resemble hers.  
  
Rosaline smiled when she noticed me staring at her.  
  
""What's wrong? Mr. Holbrook, do you have something you want to say? Are you bewitched by me?""  
  
I was speechless. She looked innocent enough, but her words were anything but likable.  
  
I stood up and walked toward the door, opening it with a cold tone. ""Get out. And don't come back to this room.""  
  
Rosaline sneered, grabbed her things, and walked out.  
  
Queenie stood at the door, looking stunned when Rosaline emerged. Her exaggerated expression and poor acting made it clear—she was the one who'd led Rosaline into the wrong room last night.  
  
But I didn't call her out. I wanted to see how Rosaline would handle the trap Queenie had set.  
  
Rosaline didn't show any sign of panic. Instead, she smiled at Queenie and said, ""Good morning! Just as you wished, Caden held me all night. We got along just fine.""  
  
""You're lying!"" Queenie's face turned beet red with anger.  
  
Rosaline just smiled. ""You can ask him.""  
  
Queenie turned to look at me in the room. ""Caden, what's going on?""  
  
I didn't bother explaining. Queenie had created this mess, but Rosaline had slept in my bed, and that was something I didn't want spreading around.  
  
As I watched Rosaline walk down the stairs, a wave of irritation washed over me.  
  
First impressions were everything and we couldn't have disliked each other more.



**Chapter 3 The Bumpkin**



Rosaline's POV:  
  
I left with a smile on my face.  
  
Behind me, Queenie was so furious that she actually started insulting me. ""You bumpkin Omega, let me tell you, there's no way I'll let you marry Caden and become the Luna of Eclipse Pack.""  
  
I couldn't help but laugh. She was so hostile to my arrival, setting up a trap for me on the very first day. It seemed like it wasn't me who wanted to marry Caden, but her.  
  
Caden walked out of the room, and the oppressive aura of the Alpha immediately made Queenie shrink back. She meekly called out, ""Caden.""  
  
Caden was clearly furious. I figured that Queenie, being smart, wouldn't dare make an issue of last night, as it would hurt the reputation of both packs.  
  
I cheerfully left seeing that Caden had taken charge and diffused the situation. But as I was heading downstairs, I suddenly remembered something and complained to Freya, ""What happened last night? Why didn't you wake me up when he got into bed?""  
  
Freya lazily replied, ""Please, you were the one more eager than me. Besides, his scent is really nice. I liked it.""  
  
I was taken aback. This was the first time Freya had ever expressed liking the scent of a man. I asked curiously, ""Could he be our fated mate?""  
  
Freya didn't deny it. ""Why don't we share a few more nights to confirm it?""  
  
""No!"" I immediately rejected the idea. ""I don't like him. Caden is way too arrogant.""  
  
Freya let out a mocking hum deep in my soul, clearly amused by my reaction.  
  
It was infuriating that the first time sharing a bed with a man ended up like this. But we didn't have any further contact, so it was clear that Caden wasn't my fated mate.  
  
The servant led me to the guest room where I unpacked before heading downstairs for breakfast.  
  
At the table sat Eleanor, Queenie, and, of course, the heir of Eclipse Pack—Caden.  
  
I walked over, and Eleanor spoke in a sarcastic tone, ""Someone slept in late and didn't help with breakfast. Do you think you're officially the Eclipse Pack's Luna?""  
  
I glanced at Eleanor and calmly replied, ""Well, I'm not your servant either.""  
  
*Do you want me to make breakfast? Dream on.*  
  
Caden hadn't spoken a word throughout the meal. It was obvious he didn't like me.  
  
And honestly, I didn't like him either.  
  
The whole meal was filled with unspoken tension, as each of us glared at the other. Afterward, Eleanor stopped me before I could leave and tossed a bank card at me from the table.  
  
""There's 5,000 dollars on that card. Go buy yourself some decent clothes before you go to Eclipse Group. And I'm telling you, stay in your place at the company. Don't cause any trouble for Caden.""  
  
""Eclipse Group? Me?"" I was completely confused.  
  
""Of course. Richard is trying to help you and Caden get closer by sending you to work at the company. He even arranged for you to be Caden's secretary. Otherwise, how would a bumpkin like you ever get into such a big company?""  
  
My head was spinning. It seemed like the current Alpha of Eclipse Pack, Richard, was really set on forcing some kind of relationship between Caden and me. His mind was running wild by having me, the Shadow Pack Alpha, to be Caden's secretary.  
  
Since I had agreed to stay in Eclipse Pack for three months, getting out of the house and doing something was better than staying cooped up all day. I didn't want to keep facing Queenie and Eleanor.  
  
However, giving me 5,000 dollars made it look like she was looking down on me.  
  
I couldn't help but sarcastically reply, ""Thank you, but I don't need it.""  
  
All my clothes were custom-made. To be honest, most people wouldn't recognize the brand, but I couldn't be bothered to argue. After saying that, I went upstairs to change.  
  
As soon as I got upstairs, my phone buzzed. A transfer of 50 million dollars appeared in my account, with an almost endless string of zeros.  
  
""My dear Alpha, make sure to take care of yourself. Buy whatever you want, eat whatever you want. Don't be shy about spending the money.""  
  
I smirked and replied, ""Grandpa, the Holbrooks are bullying me. It's not fun at all.""  
  
Grandpa quickly responded.  
  
""Really? It's rare for someone to dare bully you. Hmm, great! Alright, I'm going fishing now.""  
  
I was at a loss for words.  
  
After changing into a professional outfit, I left the Holbrook Manor. The same driver from yesterday opened the car door for me. But when I got inside, I found that Caden was also in the car.  
  
""Didn't you say you weren't interested in me at all? Then why are you going to Eclipse Group to be my secretary?"" Caden's deep voice was tinged with sarcasm.  
  
I smiled faintly and glanced at him. ""I promised my grandfather that I would spend three months with you. After that, we'll break off the engagement.""  
  
Caden snorted. ""Aren't you afraid that you'll start liking me after three months? Don't end up sticking around the Holbrooks by then.""  
  
I couldn't help but laugh. His arrogance was truly ridiculous.  
  
In my eyes, Caden was nothing special. Sure, he was handsome, but other than that, he was worthless—especially with that sharp tongue of his.  
  
""So, the rumors about the aloof and untouchable Mr. Holbrook were true. You're really that full of yourself, huh? Let me tell you, it doesn't matter if it's three months or three years—I'll never like you. Not in this lifetime.""  
  
Caden's POV:  
  
*Not in this lifetime?*  
  
*If she doesn't like me, why is she here in Eclipse Pack?*  
  
Looking at Rosaline's defiant expression, I figured she was probably playing hard to get.  
  
""Rosaline, you better remember what you said today,"" I said darkly.  
  
Rosaline flashed a fake smile. ""Sure, Mr. Holbrook. Don't worry. We'll part ways after three months. Oh, and let's pretend we don't know each other at work to avoid any unnecessary misunderstandings.""  
  
I turned my head, not wanting to look at her anymore, and signaled the driver to start the car.  
  
My phone buzzed with some screenshots from my secretary, showing a conversation from the company's group chat.  
  
""Did you hear? Mr. Holbrook's fiancée is coming to work at Eclipse Group as Mr. Holbrook's secretary.""  
  
""I heard that she was ugly and she was from the countryside. I wonder if she graduated from a degree mill. Can she even read documents?""  
  
""Hahaha, she probably doesn't even know how to operate a computer!""  
  
...  
  
As expected, good news never stays in one place, and gossip travels far.  
  
""Mr. Holbrook, there's some negative talk at the company about your fiancée joining the team. Should I try to control the rumors?""  
  
My secretary asked for my opinion, and I glanced at Rosaline, then smiled slightly and replied.  
  
""No need. Let it spread. After all, I don't want this marriage either.""



**Chapter 4 The Awesome Me**



Rosaline's POV:  
  
I followed Caden into the company. As we passed the employee workstations, whispers filled the air.  
  
Of course, I knew that the news of my engagement to Caden had already caused a stir throughout the city. I was mentally prepared for the gossip and stares.  
  
But with my enhanced Alpha hearing, their words were not what I had expected.  
  
""Look, look, who's that woman behind the boss? She's so beautiful, and her aura is amazing!""  
  
""Wow, her legs are perfect! I'm jealous!""  
  
""Could she be Mr. Holbrook's fiancée?""  
  
""No way. That can't be.""  
  
I realized what was happening. These people, like Eleanor, probably expected me to be a clumsy, naive country girl from distant Frostmoore, someone completely out of place. But no one had expected the woman walking beside Caden, heading to work, to be so beautiful and composed.  
  
I ignored their chatter and headed straight for the HR department to complete my paperwork. When I returned, I overheard several secretariat staff gossiping.  
  
""Rosaline is so gorgeous! She's even prettier than Wendy!""  
  
""Beauty's great and all, but she's just some Omega from the countryside. How could she possibly be worthy of Mr. Holbrook?""  
  
A voice dripping with disdain reached my ears, and I couldn't help but smile coldly. I pushed open the door and walked up to the rude girl.  
  
Standing tall and looking down at her, I saw her name tag. Stella Dixon, Head of Secretariat.  
  
With a hint of sarcasm, I asked, ""Yeah, I'm not worthy of him, but are you?""  
  
Her face stiffened as she looked up and saw who it was. The words she was about to say died in her throat, and the others quickly scattered.  
  
I smirked. These people were pretending to be polite, but deep down, they were clearly dissatisfied. They were only holding their tongues because I was still engaged to Caden.  
  
""Mr. Holbrook said you're part of the secretariat now, so you should be treated fairly. This is an advertisement shoot that Eclipse Group is working on today. You'll be in charge of it,"" Stella said as she handed me a file.  
  
I took the file and turned to leave.  
  
""Stella, is this the ad Ryan's doing? I hope Rosaline doesn't mess it up,"" one of the girls whispered.  
  
""Ryan is a huge star. He's young, temperamental, and loves to nitpick. No one can stand him. Wouldn't it be hilarious if Rosaline messed up her first day?""  
  
""Ryan's brother has been close friends with Caden since childhood, and we all know Ryan's temper. He's trouble, and I'm sure Rosaline will have a hard time with him.""  
  
The women were clearly trying to set me up.  
  
I glanced through the ad shoot details. Ryan? That name seemed familiar.  
  
The shoot was scheduled at Eclipse Group, and when the time came, I went downstairs with a few colleagues to greet Ryan Lindsay, the star.  
  
A black Bentley rolled into the parking lot, and Ryan stepped out, wearing sunglasses. At 19, he already had millions of fans. His swagger as he walked toward us screamed rebellion and indulgence.  
  
Under the urging looks of my colleagues, I stepped forward to greet him. ""Hello, Mr. Lindsay. I'm Rosaline, the coordinator for this shoot ... ""  
  
Before I could finish my sentence, Ryan, his face still proudly tilted upward, interrupted with a sharp complaint. ""It's so hot, and none of you thought to get me an umbrella? Is the set ready for the shoot? Oh, and you, go get me a coffee. From that place in the city center—""  
  
He stopped mid-sentence, his cocky expression turning into one of complete surprise.  
  
I smiled at him. This brat finally recognized me.  
  
""D\*mn, Rosie! Am I dreaming?"" Ryan ripped off his sunglasses and stared at me in disbelief.  
  
""Rosie? What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be out traveling the world or lounging in some 15 feet bed by now?""  
  
He threw his arms around me, pulling me into a hug.  
  
I patted his head, chuckling. ""It's been a while, Ryan. By the way, what did you say you wanted to drink?""  
  
Ryan quickly waved his hands in denial. ""No, no, I didn't say anything! What do you want? I'll go get it for you.""  
  
Everyone around us was completely stunned.  
  
I could understand their shock. The tyrant was being affectionate with the new girl at the company and it was a bit much for them to process. I had even patted Ryan's head, and now he was offering to buy me a drink.  
  
None of it made sense.  
  
They must have thought Ryan was being so friendly because he already knew I was engaged to Caden, but what they didn't realize was that Ryan and I had known each other for five years.  
  
When Ryan was 15, he was filming in the countryside near Frostmoore, which was also near my home.  
  
During that time, Ryan ran into a Rogue that was wandering in the wild. I happened to be there and saved him.  
  
I had just turned 16, and using only my fists, I beat the Rogue—who had shifted into his wolf form—into submission.  
  
Ryan was shocked by the whole thing. To him, I was the coolest person he'd ever met. His second shock came when I took him home to the Shadow Pack Manor, which was even bigger than any palace in the world.  
  
From that moment on, I became the most impressive Alpha in the entire Werewolf Continent in Ryan's eyes.



**Chapter 5 He's My Fiance**



The rest of the photo shoot went smoothly, much to the disappointment of those gossipy hens.  
  
None of the things they had hoped for came to pass.  
  
Ryan complained about his clothes being ugly, but when I said they looked good, he didn't dare argue.  
  
Ryan couldn't resist nitpicking about the shoot, but one glance from me was enough to make him fall silent.  
  
Even after three years, he was still so easily intimidated by me. And I'd never even laid a finger on him!  
  
What was supposed to be a five-hour shoot ended up taking just two hours, all thanks to Ryan's cooperation.  
  
Afterward, Ryan grabbed my hand and wouldn't let go. ""Rosie! Let's go, I'm treating you to dinner!""  
  
""No, thank you. I haven't finished work yet,"" I politely declined.  
  
There were still some company employees nearby. It would be awkward to be so friendly with him, especially since he was such a big client.  
  
""My Moon Goddess! Mr. Lindsay invited Rosaline to dinner and she actually turned him down!"" one of them whispered.  
  
""Wow, who is Rosaline actually? She's not only pretty but so impressive! Are you sure she's from the countryside?""  
  
""If Ryan invited me, I'd eat with him even if I had to strike!""  
  
The annoying whispers started to creep into my ears. I quickly asked Freya to reduce the amplification of my hearing. At last, it was peaceful again.  
  
Ryan, looking a little crestfallen, pouted. ""Rosie, why are you working at Eclipse Group? Did the Shadow Pack go bankrupt or something? If so, I'll support you!""  
  
I rolled my eyes at him. ""You wouldn't understand my world.""  
  
With that, I left him staring blankly, returning to the secretariat to finish my day.  
  
At the end of the workday, Caden walked out of his office. When he saw me sitting at my desk, he said, ""Grandpa booked a table for us and wants us to have dinner together. Let's go.""  
  
I looked at him, feeling puzzled. Caden sighed a hint of helplessness in his voice. ""Grandpa had a heart condition lately, and he's been recovering. He said that since you're here, he insists on having a welcome dinner tonight. If not, he'll refuse to accept the treatment.""  
  
I chuckled. Richard certainly knew how to pressure his younger family members into doing what he wanted, just like my grandfather did.  
  
At that moment, Ryan walked in.  
  
""Rosie, you're off work now, right? Can we grab dinner now?""  
  
I was surprised that he had waited outside my office for five hours since the shoot ended.  
  
Ryan then noticed Caden was with me.  
  
""Caden?"" he exclaimed.  
  
""Rosie?"" Caden looked at the two of us in confusion.  
  
I sighed and looked at both of them. ""Since we're all going to dinner, why don't you join us?""  
  
In the end, Ryan got into the car with us under Caden's questioning gaze.  
  
Ryan didn't stop talking the entire ride. I responded only occasionally to save him from being embarrassed.  
  
When we reached the restaurant, Ryan's enthusiasm kicked into full gear. He hurried to pull out my chair, refill my water, and serve me food.  
  
Caden's expression was one of surprise.  
  
""By the way, Rosie, why did you come to Eclipse Group to work? And what's your relationship with Caden?"" Ryan asked, eyeing me and Caden back and forth with a look that said, ""Something is going on between you two.""  
  
I glanced at Caden before answering casually, ""My Grandpa asked me to come. Caden and I are engaged.""  
  
Ryan, who had just taken a sip of water, spat it out.  
  
""What?"" he exclaimed, wiping his mouth with his sleeve. ""Caden's fiancée from the countryside is you?""  
  
I nodded, not surprised by his reaction.  
  
""You two?"" Ryan looked at me in disbelief. ""You? Countryside?""  
  
I shot a subtle glare at him and he quickly shut his mouth.  
  
Yes, I came from the countryside. But that countryside was home to a mansion worth billions, countless luxury villas, and even a private airport.  
  
""Grandpa said that the engagement will be called off after three months if we don't have any feelings for each other by then,"" I added, softening my gaze.  
  
Ryan looked between me and Caden, and in his blunt manner, he couldn't resist adding, ""Well, that's good. Caden doesn't deserve you. He's so cold and boring—he's not even as good as I am.""  
  
Caden, who had been quietly eating, suddenly looked up. His expression darkened.  
  
I had a feeling he wouldn't take that comment well. It was clear from his narcissistic nature that hearing Ryan say he wasn't good enough for me would annoy him.  
  
""Ryan, remember that car you wanted? Your brother asked me to help buy it for you, but I think ... "" Caden began.  
  
""Wait, wait, wait, Caden! I didn't mean it like that!"" Ryan chuckled awkwardly, sticking out his tongue, and finally stopped talking.  
  
Neither of us dared to offend him, and the rest of the meal was much quieter, and more enjoyable without his chatter.  
  
At the restaurant door, Ryan reluctantly bid farewell to me.  
  
""Goodbye, Rosie! I'll come find you to hang out whenever I can.""  
  
I patted his head with mock affection. ""See you around, Ryan. Be careful on your way home!""  
  
It felt like I was saying goodbye to one of my pets.  
  
As I watched Ryan leave, Caden spoke up, his voice colder than usual, ""So, you're sure you won't like me because you already have someone you like, right?""",1,1747132509.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

My case all started in 2022 when suddenly I had this first symptom of Pylori wich is chills and sweats coming from my stomach. I ignored it because everytime was temporary and it was going away once I was eating. This symptom was more present early in the morning when my stomach was empty. I didn’t had it every day, it was  just coming and go. Next year, 2023 in September I wake up feeling very ill with some gastritis flare up caused by pylori. I couldn’t eat nothing or drink in that day  and I was just throwing up like 12 times a day. After one fully day of vomiting, sweating and feeling very bad I went to ER where  they made all tests required and they referred me the next day at an GI specialist. Next day I went for my appointment with the  GI and the Dr. suggested me endoscopy + biopsy to exclude bad things first and see more clearly what’s going on. After my endoscopy  the biopsy results came: 
 mild Gastritis with positive of H pylori also some Class A Los Angeles esophagitis caused all by this mad H. Pylori which probably was residing in me for years. I made some quadruple antibiotics treatment in December, followed again by Pantoprazol every morning for 2 more weeks. After this I waited 5-6 weeks and I made the test stool test wich came negative. Then, also my symptoms including stomach cramps and chills every early morning disappeared completely and also no mucus in stool wich was caused by my stomach lining trying to fight the infection/gastritis. 
This didn’t last long ….as after just 3/4 months ( now in present) my early morning symptoms came back ( chills and cramps when stomach empty plus some mucus in stool). I made the blood test this time just a week ago and the results are positive again for Pylori. I’m not sure what I have done wrong as I followed the treatment  prescription and after this I didn’t drink fizzy drinks or alcohol  just very limited maybe a can in two weeks. Also not spicy foods and I’m not drinking coffee at all. I’m very frustrated as now I need to be back on this antibiotics for another 14 days but it doesn’t guarantee me nothing and also this symptoms are back.  
Did someone had the same? How did you manage to get rid of this? Did someone tried Natural treatments like mastic gum ? Should I focus on how to heal gastritis first and Is here anyone who has really good experience / knowledge about this bacteria? Thanks",3,1747132448.0,HPylori,1,1.0,False
1klikxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/brussels/comments/1klikxp/brussels_babel_104_languages_zero_governments_and/,"Brussels Babel: 104 languages, zero governments - and a system from 1970.","Today we wake to the news that Brussels' MPs have decided they still continued to be paid regardless as to whether they actually agree on anything. Truly, activity is a substitute for achievement - who knew that our regions' politics was run on the same model as the bar staff at Belga on a sunny Saturday afternoon?

What kind of capital city can field a NATO summit on Tuesday, host a rail strike on Wednesday and see twin for-and-against protest marches by Thursday and yet, 340 days later, cannot even agree who gets to sit together? Brussels, of course: a metropolis that can have *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* translated by a native Tigrinya-speaker but cannot translate an election into an administration.

The region has now drifted eleven months without a cabinet, without a budget and - if we are honest - without a clue. While Eurocrats exchange PowerPoints in flawless Globish, the local statute book continues to perform an elaborate two-step between French and Dutch, a dance nobody under forty even bothers to watch. Brussels, once described by Charles Baudelaire as “an old lady who dreams she is still nineteen,” has evidently started dreaming she is nineteen and bilingual, long after the rest of Europe has moved on to a polyglot WhatsApp group.

*A Constitution Recorded on a C-60 Cassette*

As you might know from your mandatory integration course, Belgium’s answer to its 1960s language wars was to ossify them in the 1970s constitution. Three “language communities” were granted their own parliaments, budgets and grievance machines. Brussels, inconveniently situated at the linguistic fault-line, received two mirror-image social-service commissions - each with offices, chauffeurs and pot-plants - so that a housing benefit form could be filed twice before vanishing into the same filing cabinet. In 1971 this looked like enlightened power-sharing. In 2025 it looks like a Betamax wired to a smartphone charger: faintly heroic, mostly ridiculous and absolutely certain to burst into smoke when you switch it on.

The price of this nostalgia is not merely clerical. Every police requisition, every hospital tender, every bicycle-lane subsidy still passes two bureaucracies travelling on parallel rails that will never meet. The Flemish side worries about “francisation”; the Francophone side frets about “Flemish domination”; the rest of the city, now busy ordering ramen in Portuguese, wonders whether either tribe realises that cassette players went out with sideburns. A constitution written to keep two factions from throttling each other is now throttling the city itself.

*The Arithmetic of Never-Never Land*

According to regional rules, any Brussels cabinet must command not one but two separate majorities: thirty-seven of the seventy-two Francophone seats and nine of the seventeen Flemish ones. This is coalition sudoku played on a chessboard soaked in kerosene. The Flemish bloc, after the usual hostage negotiations, finally scraped together the requisite nine seats by bolting Flemish greens, liberals and social democrats to the nationalist N-VA. Cue outrage next door: the Socialist Party on the Francophone side declared that sitting with N-VA would be like sharing a pedalo with a shark. Flemish Groen would happily rule with N-VA if that lands a minister’s car; French-speaking Ecolo insists the climate will collapse if N-VA so much as gets a parking space. Meanwhile PS refuses to govern with N-VA on principle, while its Flemish cousin Vooruit has already printed the joint business cards. The then-negotiator, David Leisterh, solemnly announced in February that “the positions do not allow a majority,” which is policunt-speak for ""I’d rather gargle a cock made of nails than spend any more time arguing with these dogmatic twatbags.""

Since then Brussels has been running on caretaker autopilot. The debt clock whirrs past €14 billion; the deficit fattens by an estimated €4 million a day; finance minister Sven Gatz, marooned in limbo, notes that at least the Titanic *tried* to avoid the iceberg before it hit. Meanwhile municipal staff, forbidden to sign long-term contracts, pass the time ordering coffee machines labelled *property of the other language community -* an irony so rich it could buy its own penthouse in one of the leafier parts of Uccle.

The solution, were anyone brave enough to utter it, is to stop demanding mirror majorities and ask parties to muster a single, city-wide coalition like grown-ups elsewhere. The moment that rule changes, half the political pantomime collapses. But courage is short supply in a system that rewards trench-digging over bridge-building; history may record that Brussels waited for its finances to implode before it amended the voting calculus that has already imploded common sense.

*Brussels Babel and the Myth of Two Herds*

While the politicians replay their 1970s quarrel, the Fifth Brussels Language Barometer cheerfully notes that 104 languages were in daily use last year. French, once an unassailable lingua franca (literally), now reaches 81 percent of residents; English, lubricated by Netflix and Erasmus, has surged to 47 percent. Dutch—remember, half the constitution pivots on it - has slipped to 22.3% *able to understand it*, the statistical equivalent of an endangered dialect in Cornwall. As a \*home (\*i.e. a first language spoken at home natively) language, Dutch has dropped below 8%, and Arabic (mostly Moroccan Darija) has climbed above 11% - on track to become the city’s second native tongue. Nearly half the population was born outside Belgium, and a tenth speak neither official language nor English at all.

This mismatch between paperwork and pavement is not academic. A Moroccan mother in Molenbeek, whose toddler’s first words are likely to be Darija and French, can still be told by a municipal crèche to fill out her forms in whichever “community” she prefers - as long as that preference is French or Dutch but definitely not Arabic, English, Italian or anything that corresponds to reality. A constitution that once soothed tempers now behaves like an ancient buffer at the front of the bus, insisting the driver shut the doors because that’s how it was done in 1979, never mind the commuters hammering on the windows.

This is not a matter of 'you come here, you speak the local language' - that is a fair argument - but no where else in the world argues over the balance of two tongues like Brussels does - whilst ignoring the fact that the majority of people speak only one of the two and the second has become almost a quaint curiosity - a bit like when you hear actual Latin spoken in the Vatican.

There is an obvious fix. Admit English, already the de-facto working language of the EU quarter and around much of the world, as a third administrative tongue for spoken dealings; nobody dies, the earth continues to spin and migrants can finally renew their driving licences without resorting to mime and culturally-approved hand gestures. If written documentation has to wait for a federal rewrite, so be it: spoken comprehension is what pulls a city together, not yet another triplicate of paperwork across several layers of government in a language neither of which you speak well - essential when you are potentially dealing with important rules and regulations that will affect you and your family. Truly, you may have any colour you like, so long as it's black.

*The Price of Pretending: Debt, Violence and Bureaucratic Farce*

Brussels is hardly alone in accumulating a mountain of debt - Paris is hardly a model of thrift - but it is unique in doing so without a government to hold the shovel. A city piling up €1.6 billion in fresh deficit this year ought to be sweating over budget lines; instead its parliament meets only to note that it cannot agree - or to debate whether war in Gaza is 'bad' (hint: yes. Also hint: there is nothing relevant Brussels as a city can do about it). Worse, the vacuum attracts real-world predators. This year's daily pre-dawn gunfire (and handy alarm clock for locals) around Clémenceau metro, widely assumed to be drug-related, forced the closure of half the southbound network while police hunted suspects through the tunnels. The suspects haven't been caught mind, but activity *is* achievement, remember!? Business leaders warn the region is “sliding towards the abyss,” which may sound melodramatic until you discover that the police service ordered new body armour months ago but cannot finalize the purchase because no minister can sign off on the invoice.

There is, again, a solution hiding in plain sight. Scrap the twin community anachronism \[whilst perhaps considering - maybe - the collectivization of certain city functions that don't actually need to be spread over 19 communes and 19 mayors. Police? Urban planning? Hello? Anybody?\] The the multi-layered and bisecting administrations laboring to achieve identical tasks on separate letterheads - and replace them with single administrative and social-services agencies. Plough the savings into language tuition for newcomers and a modest raise for teachers and for the police officers currently patrolling the metro with kit that predates Tinder \[where most people write in English, funnily\]. The constitutional lawyers will howl, but the residents currently dodging stray bullets might feel inclined to send thank-you cards.

*Exit Music for a Broken Record*

It is often said that Belgium survives because its citizens ignore their politicians, and nowhere is this truer than in Brussels. Somali lullabies drift out of crèches in Saint-Josse; Italian start-ups brainstorm fintech in Saint-Gilles; Dutch hipsters debate espresso ratios in Sainte-Catherine; English haunts every corridor between Schuman and Place Luxembourg. The city conducts its daily symphony in whatever key it fancies, while the constitution struggles to tune a broken harpsichord. Perhaps our goal for this year should be to realize it's 2025 not 1965 - and reform according to the city we have and want, not the one agreed half a century ago by the grandparents of 'native' people who don't even live in the city anymore?!

Changer de disque, bedankt!.

**Chapter 1**

“No…please.”

I was suddenly pulled into someone’s embrace from behind, the heat of his body searing through mine.

""Be good,"" the man growled, his voice rough with desire.

The rising temperature and the scorching skin mixed with breaths that were coming too fast, throwing off their rhythm.

My legs slowly climbed around his body, and the resistance in my voice shifted to something far more seductive.

I opened my eyes to the morning light, no longer looking at the man beside me.

What a night.

Quietly, I dressed, covering the marks he’d left on my neck and left the room.

When I returned home, my mother was brewing coffee, eyes bright with expectation.

I heard my own voice, raspy and dry, “Mom, I’ve agreed to reject Ronan, break off the engagement, and become Cassian’s Luna.”

As she nodded in satisfaction, I smiled bitterly.

""Mom... what was in that juice you gave me yesterday?""

Her eyes flashed with panic for a brief moment before she quickly masked it with a facade of calmness.

“It was just juice. What, do you think I would poison you? Ungrateful rat! Don't expect anything from me again!""

I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. “Fine.”

In the midst of her curses, I dragged my heavy feet back to my room.

The tiny 7-square-meter room, with no windows, only a small ventilation shaft, had originally been a storage room.

When I was seven, and had to return pack to attend school, it was converted into my bedroom.

Though the pipe had been sealed, the damp, moldy smell still seeped through the cracks on rainy, gloomy days.

For 18 years, every night, the sound of footsteps from upstairs would wake me.

But today, when I buried myself under the narrow covers, I slept the deepest and most restful sleep I’d ever had.

Because that glass of juice had severed the last of the tenderness I’d once held for this family.

From that moment on, I would expect nothing from them.

Now, I feared nothing.

Zaria had always stolen what was mine—though she lacked for nothing.

It was as if everything that was mine should belong to her.

If it was mine, she would surely lay claim to it.

I loved writing stories, but I could never keep one. However well I hid them, she'd find and shred them overnight.

Dad didn't care. Mom took Zaria's side, scolding me: ""Just scraps of paper! How dare you blame your sister?""

If I spoke twice to any boy, Zaria would parade him before me the next day: ""Meet my boyfriend.""

And then there was Ronan.

His grandmother and mine had been close friends since childhood, and I’d met him when we were young.

So, when we met again in pack training, he treated me kindly.

When we turned 16 and our wolves were awakened, we discovered that we were fated mates.

We mated to each other, and Ronan was my first love.

I cherished the bond we shared.

I didn’t mind when other things were taken away, but Ronan was the only person in the world, aside from my grandmother, who treated me with kindness.

Though Ronan had promised me time and time again that he loved only me, I couldn’t shake the fear when I thought of Zaria and her greedy gaze.

So, except for my grandmother, no one else knew that Ronan and I were fated mates.

A year ago, when my grandmother’s health began to deteriorate, she was worried I would be mistreated after she was gone, so she arranged for Renna to formally bind me and Ronan in marriage.

My grandmother understood me and wanted to make final attempt to protect me.

But the day after the news of my engagement spread, Zaria showed up early at our training ground, demanding Ronan.

When I saw her, a chill ran through my veins, down to my core.

At first, Ronan treated her like a spoiled, somewhat reckless she-wolf.

But three months ago, when I returned home to grab something, I saw Ronan standing outside my house, leaning against the car door.

Zaria came running out of the house and threw herself into his arms.

Ronan lowered his head to kiss her, and didn’t even notice that I was standing not far away.

I instinctively tightened my hand, which lit up my phone screen.

A minute ago, Ronan had just sent me a message:

“Sorry, Nyla, there’s a pack gathering today. I won’t be able to have dinner with you.”

Behind them, Zaria coiled around him like a viper, smirking at me over his shoulder.

**Chapter 2**

I woke up to find it was already past 2 p.m.

Zaria lounged in the living room in a silk slip, malice dripping from her gaze as I emerged.

""How was the old freak? Word is he's so brutal, survivors either get carried out or leave missing limbs. Which are you? Someone like you, who only loves writing horror stories, must have enjoyed it, right?”

She'd mocked my mystery novels for years, calling me twisted.

I paused and instinctively recalled last night’s Alpha.

Broad shoulders, long legs, a narrow waist, and his hands still felt like they had the strength of solid muscle.

But... he didn’t quite match the terrifying, homely old Alpha I had heard of, did he?

Alpha Cassian had been sent to train with other packs since he was a child. They said he was spoiled and had a poor reputation for being eccentric and erratic in his actions.

As the pack’s Alpha, he didn’t care much about pack affairs, usually letting Ronan and the beta handle things, making him a mysterious figure.

After two years back, he'd never even visited Emberwind's packhouse.

Zaria slowly said, “I heard Alpha Cassian is really gross, totally worn out by drink and women, that’s why he stays hidden. Nyla, doesn’t that suit you perfectly?”

“Fine.”

“Zaria, you can have my fiancé. From now on, call me Luna.”

Zaria didn’t see the tears that were almost breaking me, but her face darkened, her teeth clenched in anger as she spat out:

“You’ve got a sharp tongue. Go ahead and serve the old man for the rest of your life! I’m the one who will be Ronan’s Luna, the one who will spend my life with him! Ronan is going to be the Alpha of the pack, not that old man. He doesn’t even care about the pack, so don’t dream about being Luna. Ronan’s dad will make Ronan the pack’s Alpha, not that old man Cassian!”

She continued. ""Once that meddling crone dies, who'll protect you then?""

Zaria could say whatever she wanted to me, but when she insulted my grandmother, I couldn’t just stand there.

I took two steps forward and grabbed a handful of her hair, growling at her, “Don’t you dare insult Grandma!”

Zaria pulled at my shirt collar and screamed, ""She should've died years ago! Rotting in h—""

I was furious, “Shut up!”

Ignoring the pain in my scalp, I swung my arm and hit her hard across the face.

Zaria had been spoiled her whole life; she couldn't hold her own against me in a fight.

I grabbed her by the hair and slammed her head into the wall, just as the front door opened just as our parents burst in.

They shouted and rushed over to pull us apart, but I didn’t forget to deliver a final kick to Zaria.

As Mom cradled Zaria's swollen face, screaming, Dad didn’t ask a single question. Without hesitation, he hit me across the face, his eyes fill with fury:

“Nyla, have you lost your mind? Over a boy?!""

I covered my face and looked at my father, my voice defiant, though my eyes were full of unshed tears.

“I hit her because she insulted Grandma, said she should go to h-”

Zaria, still crying in Mom’s arms, managed to struggle and shout, “I didn’t say that!”

Mom pointed at me, gritting her teeth. “You’re making things up! Zaria’s always been gentle and well-mannered. No wonder Ronan prefers Zaria. He doesn’t want you!”

Dad's glare turned glacial. To him, daughters were bargaining chips—whichever secured the Alpha's favor.

I snorted and, from the corner, grabbed my phone. I played the recording I had just taken.

Neither Mom nor Zaria had expected me to record the conversation, and their faces turned pale as they heard it.

After the recording finished, Dad turned to Zaria in disbelief:

“Did you know that Luna Renna and your grandmother were childhood friends? If she hears this, how do you think you’ll become the Luna of the Emberwind pack?”

Only when it came to their own interests did Mom show any concern. Still, she was too worried about Zaria to be fully remorseful.

She said, “She’s already hurt so badly, don’t you think you should take her to the pack doctor? Can’t you wait until she’s better before talking about this?”

I closed my eyes, and a deep sense of sadness washed over me.

Even Grandma's memory only mattered when it affected their status.

What about me, the unloved daughter?

What hope had I ever held?

**Chapter 3**

A week later, my parents took both of us to the pack’s bonfire party.

The bonfire party was incredibly boring. I didn’t know a single person, so I sat in a corner, lost in thought, trying to come up with new plot twists for a mystery.

My parents were busy using the fact that their daughter was about to become the pack’s Luna as a way to socialize, trying to find business partners for their company.

Zaria, with her arm around Ronan, came over to me. I glanced at them, then continued eating while still lost in my puzzle.

Ronan said, ""Nyla.""

I paused, raising my head to look at him.

Zaria pouted and tugged on his sleeve.

Ronan spoke, ""Zaria's still young, and she makes mistakes. Please be patient with her. But you can’t hit her. Your temper’s too volatile. You really need to work on it.""

I put my plate down and sneered, ""What are saying? Call me Luna. I’ve already severed the mate bond with you. Don’t try to get close.""

Ronan stiffened, his expression darkening.

""Nyla, I know you're upset. But you two are fighting because of me, and it hurts me too.""

A wave of disgust surged inside me.

""How did I never realize before that you were so narcissistic? My grandmother always told me there were fools in the pack, and today, I’ve had the honor of meeting one. You’re shameless.""

With that barrage of insults, both of their faces darkened.

Zaria, furious and ready to spit out curses, suddenly remembered to maintain her image in front of Ronan.

She whimpered and pretended to hide in his arms.

""Ronan, now you’ve seen how fierce Nyla can be, right? I’ve been scolded by her since I was little. It’s really scary.""

Ronan, pitying her, pulled Zaria closer to him and looked at me, his face pale with anger. ""Nyla, what happened to you? I’m really disappointed in you!""

Just as I was about to snap back at him, a familiar yet unfamiliar voice interrupted:

""Do you really need to be disappointed with My Luna?""

A man with messy hair stood up from the sofa behind us.

Holding a glass of drink, he looked at Ronan with a sidelong glance. ""You’re calling pack Luna by her name? That’s so uncultured.""

Ronan gasped, ""Uncle Cassian?""

Uncle?

""Don’t call me that.""

Ronan lowered his head, ""Alpha Cassian.""

The man I had spent the night with was him!

""You’re Alpha Cassian?"" Zaria shocked.

**Chapter 4**

Cassian rubbed his tired eyes and stood up from the sofa.

He was over 6 feet.

His well-tailored suit pants clung to his long legs, and his linen shirt was unbuttoned at the collar. I couldn’t help but blush when I remembered that night, when I had kissed his collarbone.

He walked around the sofa and squeezed in next to me, casually resting his arm on the back of my chair in a protective manner.

When he turned his head to look at me, my heart involuntarily began to race.

Zaria was stunned.

She unconsciously released the hand she had tightly held around Ronan's, gasping, ""Him... is that Alpha Cassian? I thought you said...""

She suddenly covered her mouth and, after a couple of seconds of thinking, sweetly called out, ""Cassian.""

Cassian gave her a half-smile, his tone tinged with sarcasm.

""Aren’t you supposed to be Ronan’s fiancee? He calls me Alpha Cassian, and you call me just Cassian? How dare you!""

His tone became stern, and Zaria quickly lowered her head, whispering, ""Alpha.""

Ronan stood up abruptly, pulling Zaria along with him, his face dark with frustration.

""We’ll leave you two alone.""

Without a second thought, he dragged a struggling Zaria away.

Once they were gone, Cassian immediately turned his gaze back to me.

""Why did you leave alone that morning?""

His question was so direct that I instantly blushed, fumbling for words. ""Uh...""

I stammered for a long time without managing to say anything.

Cassian raised an eyebrow. ""You were talking fine just now. Why the silence now?""

He leaned in close to my ear, his voice low. ""What makes him any better than me?""

I was momentarily stunned, not sure how to respond.

Cassian chuckled softly, tousling my hair. ""I’m just kidding. Let me take you to meet my mom, former Luna Renna.""

When I was a child, Renna used to visit my grandmother every year.

Since my grandmother lived alone on the outskirts of the pack, near the coast, far from the pack’s center, Renna always brought a lot of delicious food when she visited, but she never ate any of it herself. Instead, she always had my grandmother cook for her.

Unfortunately, after that, my parents only ever took my sister to visit Grandma, and I didn’t get to see Luna Renna. There were various reasons for the rare times I did see her.

Counting the years, it had already been 20 years since I last saw her.

Cassian took my hand and led me toward Renna.

Just then, my parents suddenly appeared, looking a bit upset.

As soon as I called out ""Luna Renna,"" my mother grabbed my arm, pulling me toward the door. My father blocked my way, chatting with Renna in a casual manner.

Confused and stumbling, I managed to take a couple of steps when Cassian suddenly pulled me back forcefully.

He coldly shoved me toward Renna’s side, pressing my shoulder down and said, ""Mom, look who’s here.""

Renna looked just as puzzled, holding my hand and examining me closely.

""Cassian, what are you up to now? This is the Elwoods’ youngest daughter, right? Her name is... Zaria, right?""

My eyes widened in shock, a chill running down my spine.

""Luna Renna, I’m Nyla.""

Renna, half-pulling her glasses off, stared at me in confusion.

""Sweetheart, is Cassian making you prank me?""

She turned to my dad, saying, ""Your father already came to see me with your sister Nyla earlier today.""

Tears welled up in my eyes as I shook my head, holding onto Renna’s hand tightly.

""No, Luna Renna, I’m Nyla!""

My father, panicked, grabbed me and tried to pull me away without saying a word.

In the midst of the chaos, I shouted, ""Luna Renna, do you remember the stewed beef? It was your favorite. That year, I was naughty and secretly added a spoonful of hot sauce! When you arrived, the whole pot of meat was way too spicy, and I was running around the house as Grandma chased me.""

I continued.

""It was you! You were the one who hugged me and asked why. I told you it was because you were tired of the taste last year, and you felt uncomfortable for days. I wanted to...""

Renna stood up shakily, finishing my sentence.

""You said you wanted to make the meat spicier so I wouldn’t feel sick of it!""

The next moment, Luna Renna, with a fierce shout, pointed at my father and yelled:

""Let go of her!""",1,1747132336.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1klik2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy_Fitness/comments/1klik2c/why_wisdom_is_the_most_important_stat/,Why Wisdom Is The Most Important Stat,"For my current DnD character- Wisdom is the dump stat (technically intelligence is too 😅).  
  
It allows him to be a powerhouse on the battle field and it fits the roleplaying because he's a Triton who grew up under the sea in a very different society. So on land he's pretty ignorant.  
​  
But in real life dumping your wisdom and intelligence is **not** a good idea!  
​  
​Personally I don't want to dump any stats in real life but especially not wisdom!!  
​  
​Here's why...

https://preview.redd.it/6f4pgeao0j0f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2765fc2c989c104c7cfe4001263138c86ef64f7

Checking out the Stat Guide you'll notice wisdom is the ""Habit Building"" attribute.  
​  
​High Wisdom = Good + Strong Habits  
​Low Wisdom = Bad / No Habits  
​  
​And since I've been an in-person personal trainer since 2017 I've come to learn that habits are what makes or breaks results.

# Why Wisdom Wins

I don't want to say wisdom is *more* important than the other stats- because it all depends on context.  
​  
​But when it comes to *building* the other stats- Wisdom wins.  
​  
​Being in the fitness space as long as I have, I've seen a lot of people who want to make dramatic changes.  
​I've also seen a lot of trends pop up.  
​- Vegan  
​- Keto  
​- Carnivore  
​- Whole 30  
​- 75 Hard  
​Etc.  
​  
​When trends pop up, or when people have a boost of motivation, they make dramatic changes to their fitness / nutrition.  
​  
​This is great! Trying to implement changes to better one's self is how people become worthy of Mjölnir. (Thor's hammer)  
​  
​But here's the deal.  
​*Changes* to one's fitness / nutrition can be instant - The results we desire from said changes take time.  
​  
​What I have seen over and over and over again...  
​  
​People make the changes using constitution (mental grit / willpower) instead of wisdom.  
​  
​And willpower only lasts as long as motivation does.  
​And motivation wilts everyday results are not seen (which is most days).  
​  
​Or the change implemented has an ""end date"" like Whole 30 or 75 Hard.  
[​Here's why timeline based changes aren't so good.](https://www.ryansandmann.com/blog/daabi)But let's straighten out this meandering path...  
​  
​Unless you have a super high constitution stat- you won't be able to willpower your way to big changes that create results.  
​  
​*However...*  
*​*  
*​*Even if you have a fairly low wisdom stat- You can implement *small* habits fairly easily that create **big** changes overtime.

# Habit Building 101

The first step to building a habit is figuring out what it needs to be.  
​  
​This could be where the *intelligence* stat comes into play- But we'll just use some common examples.  
​  
​The caveat here is that it all depends on ***you*** and what ***you already do***.  
\_\_\_\_

If you...

**Do Not Workout**

If you don't workout- creating this habit could create a cascade of amazing changes and results.  
​But where to start?  
​  
​That depends on you.  
​  
​Some folks will have no problem jumping into a 1-3 day gym routine (especially if they find a source of accountability)  
​  
​Other folks might want to start with 15 minute workouts at home 2-4 days per week.

\_\_\_\_

If you...

**Workout Regularly**

If you're already working out regularly you might benefit more from focusing on habits outside the gym.  
​But where to start?  
  
​​That depends on you.  
  
​How is your nutrition?  
How is your sleep?  
Do you move much durning the day outside of your workouts?  
  
What do you think you'd ***be able*** to change?

\_\_\_\_

Figuring out where to start is half the battle- Which is why I created a quiz to help you figure out *where* to start and **how** to start > [Check it out!](https://results-drum-s33.craft.me/GaVGjob0Acayqc)  
​  
​The key is finding something small enough to make it easy to implement but big enough to make a difference.  
​- Finding 15 minutes every day to take a walk  
​- Creating a morning mobility routine  
​- Making quick recipes you like that align with your goals.  
​  
​Once you have your habit to implement the focus switches to...  
​- Eliminating obstacles  
​- Building consistency  
​  
​Every habit we try to implement will have obstacles.  
​But once we break those down- it just becomes part of our daily / weekly routine.

# Breaking Down Obstacles To Build Up Habits

By this point in my career I've heard about all the obstacles that get in the way of results.  
​  
​Sometimes people just want to complain about them and not actually break them down 😅  
​But I have thought of ways to help whether my clients want them or not!  
​  
​In my experience the obstacles come down to a lack of...  
​- Time  
​- Energy  
​- Know How  
​  
​Most people **know** getting more steps in will be beneficial.  
​Most people **know** they should get more fruits, veggies, protein, or water.  
​  
​But a lack of time, energy, or know how keeps them from getting it done.  
  
The thing is, we do have the time and energy we're just using it for other things.  
We might not have the know how, but that's pretty easy to get nowadays.  
  
**Cooking A Nutritious Meal:**  
  
**​**Time Obstacle Fix: Cooking only takes 5-15 minutes of active attention.  
\- Cook a one pan meal that give you 3-6 meals and only takes 30 minutes.  
\- Cook while you watch Netflix on your laptop.  
\- Do dishes on the side.  
  
Energy Obstacle Fix: Cooking a meal that gives 3-6 servings only takes 30 minutes.  
\- When do you have 30 minutes worth of energy (and time)?  
\- Cook while you watch Netflix on your laptop.  
\- Meal prep 2 different big batch meals on Sunday after coffee (This should not take more than 45 minutes and give you 6-10 meals for the week)  
  
Know How Obstacle Fix: Cooking is easier than you think!  
[\- Heres is an example of how I get it done.](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-QTdOVMLSK/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)Gimme a follow if you want to see more easy cooking stuff 😉  
  
**Getting More Exercise:**  
**​**  
**​**Time Obstacle Fix: Exercise doesn't need to take a ton of time.  
\- 15 minute at home workout routines.  
\- Scheduled gym sessions on your most flexible days.  
\- 15 minute walk everyday after lunch.  
  
Energy Obstacle Fix: Energy can be produced when necessary.  
\- Jam out to your favorite music.  
\- Workout early- right after coffee.  
\- Use a walking pad while you watch Netflix or work on a hobby.  
  
Know How Obstacle Fix: Don't overthink where / how to start.  
\- Reach out to a pro.  
\- Google (or ask Ai) relevant exercises for your ability level.

1klijag,https://i.redd.it/lcm28ml51j0f1.jpeg,Frag newbie here - my new collection - blind buy thoughts,"These were all blind buys, i am new to fragrances  and i wanted to get myself a decent collection for the next 4-5 years. With that said, some of these frags have blew me out of the water, while others...not so much. I'm gonna try to review all of them but keep in mind i am new and i am gonna judge strictly off the first impression each of these gave me.

Al Haramain Amber Oud Tobacco Edition (~40$) -9.5/10

Pretty sweet and spicy in the beginning with hints of cinnamon, then it settles into a mix of vanilla, tobacco and some sort of sweet fruits i guess. I actually got to wear this more than the others, and i can say that it has amazing longevity, over 10h and it just smells INCREDIBLE, great date perfume the only time i got complimented (so far) was with this and i was told it was just like TF Tobacco Vanille

Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa (~25$) -9.5/10

Also sweet and spicy in the beginning, but not in the same way as Al Haramain, there's definitely cinnamon there and it is stronger, but it's a different scent. As it settles, it gets a decently strong coffee note mixed with sweet candy, vanilla and some sort of chocolate.   Great longevity over 8 hours, and if i were to choose if this was better than Al Haramain overall, i couldn't say, both are incredible winter frags, they both have a cinnamon opening, but they are very much different.

Paris Corner Ophidian Mango Bliss (~25$) - 8/10

Strong Mango Lemony opening with subtle ginger in there, a very fresh fragrance i might say. As it settles down, the smell doesn't change much, but the lemon and ginger do slowly fade out, and what is left is a fresh, not quite yet ripe mango smell. Dissapointgly enough, the longevity of this is not that great, i got 5-6 hours so far out of it, but i do love the smell. If the longevity gets better, i could easily give it a 9/10.


Now here is one of my questions as a newbie, could it be that since these are all arabian fragrances, some of them would benefit from sitting for a while so their longevity could improve and the ingredients mix along to give better notes? Cause honestly, most of the fragrances that i got from here on out, have dissapointed me especially in their openings.

All the fragrances below i have only got yesterday so i can't speak of their longevity over a normal day out. I also got all of these for 140$(most of everything i got was from discounter frag sites)


Lattafa Art of Arabia III  - 8/10

Ironically this was a free random Lattafa 20ml sample i got with my order, and it is one of the best (at least for now) frags i got from the 140$ order. It has a very similar opening to Lattafa Qahwa (from what my untrained nose can tell) but without any coffee in the background. Then it slowly gets to a wonderful sweet dates note that will fade away as u wear it.

Afnan Supremacy Not Only Intense - 8/10

A very strong opening that i can't identify, i assume it is black currant + bergamot from the notes breakdown. I am not gonna lie, it might be too strong and sharp of a beginning for me, but i can honestly see it growing on me. As it settles down, the strong beginning slowly gives place to a more pleasant lavender, patchouli and towards the end, a saffron note that i actually enjoy. Might give it an 8.5/10 i just gotta test this out a little bit more.

Afnan 9PM - 7/10

Very synthetic apple opening assaulting my nose :/. Fortunately, as it settles down, that synthetic smell goes away, and a better smell of various flowers and vanilla settles in. I am honestly very dissapointed with this opening, if it remains the same, i might just have to rub my wrists together just so i go through the opening faster.

Khadlaj Shiyaaka - 7.5/10

This has a better opening than 9PM, with strong pepper notes as well as rosemary. It is an interesting fragrance and it doesn't feel bad overall, i can't really tell what is going on as it dries down but i kinda like it, it's some mix of plants and flowers that i can't identify. This i can see growing on me, it's just that as a first impression it doesn't blow me out of the water.

Lattafa Asad - 7/10

Another strong pepper opening, but one thing i was expecting but can't identify is the pineapple in the opening, its like its literally only pepper and a bit of tobacco, and it also feels a bit synthetic. It gets a more natural feeling as it settles down with iris notes and some vanilla and wood at the very end of its lifespan. I remember when i tested Dior Sauvage Elixir a long time ago, which Asad is supposed to be a clone of, and i can't recall the smell exactly, but i don't remember it being so underwhelming like Asad.

Lattafa Bade'e Al Oud Honor & Glory - 6/10

The most dissapointing frag i got out of all of these. The opening is just a synthetic mess of a sorry attempt at a pineapple and some cheap dessert, i could go as far as to say it smells like some sort of sweet playdough. Now, it is ""saved"" by its vanilla drydown, which kind of gets it close to what i was expecting it to smell like, a gourmand sweet and fresh dessert that i've seen many reviews praise it to be.


I'm planning to leave most of these to sit, especially 9PM, Asad and Honor&Glory, hoping that their openings might get better and less synthetic than i smell them to be. Do you guys have any suggestions if this works at all and if it does, if there are any things i should be careful about? Like should i keep them in a closed cupboard in the dark? Temperature wise? Or should i not expect them to change too much or at all? Did any of you have similar experiences to mine?


Maybe i should've waited and been more careful about how much money i'm spending on frags as a beginner, but i also have another order that should get delivered soon, with Lattafa Najdia Intense and French Avenue Liquid Brun. I am stopping my impulse buying after this, but what should i hope of these 2 frags? I will review them as well when i get them. Thankfully everything i got was rather cheap so it's not that much of a hassle to me, but i wish i tested some of these before ordering them.

Morgan, the Alpha's Daughter. Book 1

Morgan



I wake up with a smile on my face—yesterday was the best day ever. Last night, I had my Sweet Sixteen party, and Mom had organized it to perfection. I’m not a girly girl, so pink was out of the question. Instead, Mom used a few of my favorite colors: indigo and maroon.



From the tablecloth to the decorations, everything was in indigo and maroon. Only our Pack-members were invited, just like every other year. That’s how it has always been for any party we have—whether it’s for me, the Pack, or one of my six older Brothers. Mom and Dad never invite members of other Packs. It’s an unspoken rule in our pack, one that has been in place for centuries, and I doubt it will change anytime soon.



The best part of my Sweet Sixteen was the gift from my family—a Harley-Davidson Fat Boy, custom-ordered in my favorite colors: black, indigo, and maroon. Even the outfit, helmet, and boots matched—black with indigo and maroon accents.



The jacket fits me like a glove, and the same goes for the pants, both made of a sturdy material—no doubt at Mom’s insistence. My helmet is my favorite next to the bike because Declan made sure our Pack’s crest was airbrushed onto it, using indigo and maroon. A Wolf lying near a water shore.



The boots have a two-inch heel with every possible protection feature, and again, I know Mom was behind it. But I don’t mind at all. Dad made me promise not to ride my bike until Ashton taught me how to ride safely. I had to keep a straight face when I made that promise. If only he knew I’d been riding Ashton’s bike for six months already.



My name is Morgan, and I am the youngest Pup of Alpha Tate and Luna Giselle. Like I mentioned before, I have six older Brothers. Don’t ask me how our parents managed it, but there are exactly two years and one month between each of us. To make it even creepier, we were all born on the first of the month.



We all spent our first year in the same room since Mom wanted the nursery close to their bedroom. But on our first birthday, we each got our own room. Everything was prepared weeks before my Brothers were born—Dad made sure of that.



The day before I was born, Ashton asked Mom why he didn’t have a baby Sister. Mom told him, “We don’t always get what we want.” He then asked her if she wanted a baby girl. She said, “If I get a baby girl tomorrow, I’ll be over the moon.”



Ashton and Dad had laughed their asses off, knowing for a fact that Mom wasn’t pregnant. Mom and Dad had been trying for another Pup ever since Landon was born, and Mom had been devastated when she found out she wasn’t pregnant a few months before that day. After that, she didn’t want to try again.



The next day, just after breakfast, Mom collapsed. Dad rushed her to the infirmary, my Brothers running behind him. From time to time, Dad felt the excruciating pain Mom was going through, and it took hours before our Pack-doctor finally came out to see him.



You can imagine the look on Dad’s face when Doc told him he had a baby girl. Mom panicked because nothing had been prepared for me, but she didn’t have to worry. Everyone in our Pack helped our Beta and Gamma females get everything ready. To this day, Mom still calls me her little miracle.



With Ashton being born in January, you can do the math—I'm a summer Pup, born in July.



So, I am the youngest of seven Pups and the only female, but my Brothers never treated me any differently. I might be Daddy’s little Princess, but I’m not a spoiled brat. Mom and Dad provide us with everything we need, but if we want anything extra, we have to work for it—something we’ve always accepted without argument.



I get out of bed and take a shower. As I wash my hair, I think about what to do today. Dad gave me the day off, figuring I’d sleep in after my party. And while I did wake up later than usual, it’s still early. First thing on my list—breakfast. My stomach rumbles in agreement.



I grab my training outfit from my closet, even though I don’t have training today. I’ll go through my routine on my own, since our Gamma probably isn’t expecting me. As I step out of my room, I realize something—it’s too quiet.



This is usually the time of day when everyone is rushing around. Dad hurrying out the door for his morning meeting, Ashton trailing behind him, and Mom calling after them to be on time for lunch. My other Brothers scrambling to make it to training, with Mom yelling for them to be back on time for lunch. The only one who never rushes anywhere is me.



But today, it’s eerily silent. Even our Omega isn’t in the kitchen. I am glad I can make my own breakfast.



I sit at the kitchen island with my meal and coffee, still wondering why no one is around. After finishing my coffee, I rinse my dishes and place them in the dishwasher before heading downstairs to the training grounds.



Every Pack-member I pass looks a little confused. I have to stifle a smile—looks like everyone thought I’d be sleeping in today.



As I walk down the last flight of stairs, I see that Dad’s office door is closed. He’s probably in his usual morning meeting with his Beta and Gamma. It’s one of the few times during the day when his door is shut. I walk towards the back of the Pack-house—the fastest way to get to the training grounds.



Again, I’m met with confused looks. And now, it’s starting to annoy me. Why is it so strange to see me up and about? Other than my party last night, nothing unusual happened and that means I wake up at a decent hour.



I shrug it off and get to training. The only difference today—our Gamma is a no-show. It doesn’t bother me. By the time I’m done, I’ve worked up a sweat. Grabbing my now-empty water bottle, I head back to the Pack-house. This time, I’m greeted with smiles and “Good morning”s from those I pass.



The door to Dad’s office is closed, and this time I wonder what is going on. Normally, the door would be open by now. As I pass the Beta floor, I hear a lot of commotion, but I ignore it because I am in desperate need of a shower and want to be downstairs in time for lunch.



After my shower, I blow-dry my hair before braiding it. I decide to put on my light blue, high-waisted skinny jeans with an off-the-shoulder black shirt. I grab my boots to go with my outfit and apply a little mascara before heading out of my room. Again, I am met with silence.



I decide to check the kitchen, and when I walk in, I smell that no one has been here since I left. This really worries me because Mom usually comes up here to change before lunch. I walk back toward the bedrooms and I can smell that no one has been here either in the past few hours, which is odd because my Brothers always take a shower after training.



Right now, I wish Dad had initiated me into the Pack yesterday, but I understand why he didn’t—he didn’t want me to have a splitting headache during my party. Still, it would make things easier if I could link Mom or Dad. I’ll find out what’s going on at lunch, and I feel a little better knowing I’ll see my family in a few minutes.



I decide to check my agenda on my way down to the main dining room to see when I have my Mother-Daughter day with Mom, and I nearly lose my footing when I don’t see it scheduled for this week. I go through the agenda for the next three months, but I don’t see any Mother-Daughter days planned.



This is so unlike Mom. She loves our Mother-Daughter days and always plans them ahead. It’s her way of spending time with me, and even though I was reluctant at first, I now look forward to them just as much as she does.



I hear chatter coming from the dining room and slip my phone into my back pocket as I enter the room.



Every conversation halts for a second, but soon the room is filled with chatter again. When I turn toward our table, I notice my family isn’t there yet. I walk over to the buffet, place my favorite foods onto my plate, and grab a cappuccino before heading to my seat.



I smile when I hear Mom’s voice getting closer, but the moment she walks into the dining room, she switches to the mind-link as she looks at our Beta female. It doesn’t take long before I realize that all of them are talking through the mind-link.



**Chapter 2 Sleepless Nights**



**Morgan**



It has been three months since my Sweet Sixteen, and I’m not sure if I should scream or cry. Every morning, I wake up on an empty Alpha floor. My entire family is already out the door by the time I wake up, and no matter what I try, they either ignore me or tell me they’re too busy.



For as long as I can remember, I was always with one of my Brothers when I wasn’t in school, helping in any way I could and learning a lot over the years. During my first year in school, I learned quickly that girls only wanted to be my friend in hopes of meeting one of my Brothers. They’d find no excuse to leave if none were around.



Some people didn’t want to be my friends because of who I was but because of who I knew. Because of my lack of real friends, I would help my Brothers however I could—filing papers or getting coffee as a young Pup, and when I got older, I would help them with more important things. Dad let me sit at a small desk of my own in his office as long as I was quiet. I’d just sit there reading, writing, or drawing.



Mom always said that by watching my Father and Brothers work, I’d understand the kind of work my Mate would have to do on a daily basis. She said that’s something most Lunas don’t understand anymore—they’re too busy with their parties and dinners.



By spending so much time in Dad’s office or my Brothers’ offices, I know every nook and cranny of our Pack-house. I know every position of our Warriors that are not running patrol and I know every route our patrols run. They never run the same route twice in a row, and our hidden Warriors serve as extra security.



I know which Packs we have an alliance with, which ones are friendly, and which ones we need to avoid. I also know who the Wolves and Lycans are in each Pack's leadership and who is set to take over in the future.



I know more about our Pack than all my Brothers combined. Sometimes, I’d hear Dad talk about other Alphas spoiling their Pups rotten, giving them everything they asked for. Dad wasn’t like that—he made us earn our “extras,” as he called them, which were usually things we didn’t really need.



I earned them by spending time in the kitchen, helping prepare meals throughout the day. I love being able to cook or bake. At first, I would measure the ingredients for the Omegas. When I got older, I helped cut fruits and vegetables. Over the past few years, I’ve been helping with the cooking and baking for our Pack-members, and Mom is really proud of what I’ve accomplished so far.



Spending so much time with Dad and my Brothers made Mom decide that we’d have a Mother-Daughter day once a week. It could be a day at the spa, a shopping spree, or just sitting in the garden talking about significant events in my future.



I’d rather spend my days on the training grounds with my Brothers and the Warriors than with Mom and the other Lunas talking about whatever it is they talk about. As I’ve already mentioned, I’m not a girly girl, and this was her way of bonding with me. I think she secretly wrote down everything I told her so she’d know how to organize every event to my liking. I really enjoyed my days with Mom—so long as it was just the two of us. If other females joined us, the conversation would always end up as a discussion about parties and their do’s and don’ts.



But we haven’t had a Mother-Daughter Day in the past three months. After about two weeks, I tried to bring it up with her during lunch, but she brushed me off, saying she was too busy. She’s always off somewhere with our Beta and Gamma females. She even stops talking when I walk into the room.



I tried to talk to my Brothers and Dad during those first two weeks, but I got the same response from them. Dad barely says a word to me— even a simple “Good morning” or “Hello” seems too much. All I get from my Brothers are “Not now,” “I’m busy,” “Don’t have time,” and other remarks like that. Even my training has stopped since our Gamma never shows up anymore.



Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are spent in silence, even though I know they talk to each other through the mind-link. I can’t use it since Dad still hasn’t initiated me into the Pack and every time I try to bring it up, he cuts me off. Every Pup gets initiated into the Pack on their sixteenth birthday, but for some reason, Dad forgot to hold the ceremony after my Sweet Sixteen party.



After a month, I stopped going to the dining room for meals, but I doubt anyone has noticed. 



About a month ago, I was wandering around the territory, just contemplating what to do with my life, when I found a small cottage near our northern border.



If I’m not on the training grounds, I’m at the cottage, trying to find a new purpose in life—and I think I’ve seen it. I will sign up for the King’s Army, but I am not sure yet what kind of position I would like to get. 



Over the past month, I’ve moved quite a few things to the cottage, and I spend my days there taking tests.



I hope those tests will help me determine what I’m good at and which positions in the King’s Army best suit me. 



Today, I’ll head to our Archive before going to my sanctuary. I’ll take my file out of the Archive and update it myself.



I doubt anyone has looked at it in the past three months, or someone would have noticed that I wasn’t initiated into the Pack. 



As every morning, I make my own breakfast. Once I’m done, I erase every trace of having been there. I place a few items from the pantry into my backpack before heading out the door.



Walking down the stairs, I notice that even the Pack-members are too busy to greet me. No one stops me when I enter the Archive. It only takes me a few minutes to find my file. As I expected, the last entry is from my sixteenth birthday, written by Dad. It just states that I turned sixteen that day.



I slip the file into my backpack and head out the back door toward my cottage. I don’t run into anyone on the way, and a week ago, it would have made me sad—but not anymore. I’m going to live my life the way I want and stop hoping my family will finally notice me. Those days are behind me.



I’ve cried enough tears and had enough sleepless nights. I’ll focus on my future—a future away from this Pack and my family. 



**Chapter 3 New Life**



**Ashton**



During Morgan’s Sweet Sixteen party, Dad told us we had an early morning meeting in his office the next day—there was something significant he and Mom needed to discuss with us. He mentioned that he had given Morgan the day off so she could sleep in, which would give them time to tell us what they needed to say.



I had checked on her before we all went down to Dad’s office and was surprised to see our Beta and Gamma couple present as well.



“What I’m about to tell you never leaves this room. If this gets out, it will cause many problems, and we will get attacked for it,” Dad stated, and I knew he wasn’t kidding.



“Most Pups born into our bloodline are males, and once I’ve told you everything, you’ll understand why most will think that’s a good thing. A hundred and fifteen years ago, the last female was born into our bloodline, and despite all the precautions her family took, it ended badly for her.



Like every other female in my bloodline, she received her gift on her seventeenth birthday at the exact time she was born, and a year later, she found her fated Mate. Her Father asked him to stay with them for a week, and they got to know her Mate during that week. He was a well-respected Alpha of a large Pack.



They felt they could trust him with their Daughter and her secret. They told him about her ability, and he promised them he would protect her with his life. Everything was fine for a few years, but as time passed, he realized what she could do for him and started forcing her to use her ability. The punishment for disobeying him worsened over time, and in the end, she saw no other way out.



When she found out she was pregnant with a female Pup, she took her own life. I know that his Pack is still waiting for the day another female Pup is born.”



Dad’s words left us in stunned silence. Fletcher was the first to break it.



“Is that why you called her Morgan?”



We had always wondered why she had a male’s name, but with this information, it made sense. Mom nodded in response to Fletcher’s question.



Dad had called the meeting because he wanted our help to prevent the same thing from happening to Morgan. After that, we met every morning to discuss the best course of action.



Yesterday, Hudson asked Mom the question that’s been occupying all our minds—what kind of ability Morgan will have. On her seventeenth birthday at three minutes past eleven in the evening, she will receive her gift from the Goddess.



No one knows what kind of gift it will be since it’s different for every female. Mom had researched the Pack’s Archive and discovered that seven females had been born into Dad’s bloodline. Two of them could hear thoughts, two could sense Werewolves and Lycans from a mile away, one could listen to sounds from a mile away, and one could read the memories of places as long as they had happened within twenty-four hours.



Mom started planning Morgan’s seventeenth birthday from the day she was born, adjusting the list as Morgan grew. Landon made a huge printout of the list and taped it to the wall—a reminder that we still had a lot to do. I feel relieved every time we cross something off the list.



There’s a clearing near our western border where we’ll celebrate her seventeenth birthday. It's easier to keep it a secret from her. Right now, my office is covered with indigo and maroon fabrics. We need to decide which ones to use for the party.



I smile as I think about our little spitfire. At only 5'5"", she’s a force to be reckoned with. If she gets pissed at you, there’s nowhere to run or hide. I learned that the hard way when I tossed a few of her papers in the bin next to her desk—not only did she kick me, but she also refused to talk to me for two days.



We all have stories like that. As she got older, her tantrums got worse. Mom and Dad always say she’s worse than all of their Sons combined. If you heard every story my Brothers and I have, you’d know they’re right.



Some might think we fear our parents, but there’s only one person we all really fear in this world—and that’s our baby Sister. At first, she’ll be pissed at us for keeping this a secret, but once Dad explains everything, she’ll be grateful.



Hudson asked Dad why no one ever informed the King’s Council or invited witnesses. Dad thought about it for a few days before telling us that it might prevent Morgan from facing the same fate as our ancestors. Mom and Dad will leave tomorrow morning to visit an old family friend, and I will contact the King’s Council.



I’ll also ask them to send witnesses. The more people who know, the safer Morgan will be.



Declan holds up two pieces of fabric. Even though they’re her favorite colors, I doubt she’d like them. He tosses them in the bin after I shake my head. Landon has been watching him for a while now, and I wonder when he’s planning to put Declan out of his misery.



Landon slowly walks over to Declan and looks at all the fabrics spread out on his desk. He grabs them one by one and tosses them into the bin without saying a word, steadily clearing the desk until only a few fabrics remain.



Declan sighs in relief as Landon makes his life a little easier. Both of them eye the pieces that are left, reaching for the same one at the same time. Looks like we’ve finally tackled that task. I see Michael smile as he checks off another box.



**Morgan**



After I completed all the tests, I received an email from the King’s Army stating that I had been accepted. I didn’t have to go through any extra trials or tests. I’ve already planned my departure to reach the King’s Army on the day I turn seventeen.



I moved my bike from the garage to the cottage, and so far, no one has asked about it missing from the garage. I ordered a more oversized backpack so I can take a few things with me. The rest I sent to the Academy a week ago—it’ll be waiting in the room I’ll call home for the next few years.



I wake up in the middle of the night to soft singing in my head. For a moment, I think I’m in my room at the Pack-house—until I realize the voice is unfamiliar.



*“Happy Birthday, Morgan,”* I hear the voice say.



*“You’re a week too early,”* I answer automatically, only to be met with laughter in my head.



*“Silly girl, I’m in your head. My name is Amra, and I am your Lycan,”* she responds.



Again, I tell her she’s early, but then she tells me I was born a week late—making today my birthday instead of a week from today. I don’t know how that’s possible, and Amra doesn’t want to explain it.



I let Amra go through my memories, and she becomes furious when she reaches the past year. She understands why I want to leave but asks me to give her one chance to discover why my family started ignoring me. I reluctantly agree to join my family for dinner tonight.



We spent the rest of the day talking about my childhood, our family, and everything I learned over the years from following my Dad and my Brothers. She likes looking at my memories of the Mother-Daughter days I spent with Mom, but she gets angry when she can’t find one from the past year.



When I walk into the dining room, I mention to Amra that our family isn’t present yet, and I sit down in my usual seat; it takes a few minutes before everyone is present. An Omega places my plate in front of me, but she doesn’t look surprised to see me at the table and I wonder if anyone ever noticed I hadn’t been here in nearly a year. 



I concentrate on my food and let Amra do what she wants to do. I don’t try to start a conversation with my family. When I’m finished eating, Amra tells me that our parents’ Lycans didn’t acknowledge her—not even Ashton’s Lycan.



That’s it. We are done with them.



We leave the dining room before dessert and return to the cottage to grab our backpack. I take one last look around the cottage I’ve called home for the past ten months.



I start my bike's engine, and it roars to life in the silent evening. I know exactly where our patrols are, and I waste no time crossing the border of our territory.



Leaving Blue River Pack behind in pursuit of my new life. 



**Chapter 4 Instincts**



**Luna Giselle**



For the past week, my Lycan has been acting strange, but she can’t recall anything happening during the past week to justify her feelings. Well, nothing out of the ordinary, that is, and we both decide it has to do with our little miracle’s birthday. 



Today we will spend the day on our own floor while our Pack-members organize the final details for the party.



Tate walks out of the bathroom as I walk out of our closet. He smiles at me before asking if I have everything under control.



“Of course, I have everything under control. I can’t wait to see her face when she sees what we have organized for her seventeenth birthday party,” I answer as I wrap my arms around his waist.



I walk into the kitchen to start preparing breakfast. I am going to make Morgan all of her favorite dishes. Colton and Landon are already setting the table as I pull everything I need from the pantry and the fridge. Ashton walks into the kitchen with a strange look on his face, and I ask him what is wrong.



“I don’t know, Mom. Titan feels as if he missed something major. We’ve gone over the past week, but we can’t figure it out,” Ashton answers, and I tell him that Sage has the same problem.



“We’ve been so busy organizing everything. We had to reconfirm that the King would send witnesses, and I think we’re just worried that something might go wrong.”



Tate tells us that Roman has been going through the same thing, and I think it’s safe to say that we are all worried that something might blow up in our faces. We talk about tonight’s party as the boys help me get breakfast ready. As they bring everything to the dining room, I walk toward Morgan’s room to wake her up.



As I walk down the hall to her room, something feels off, and I start to feel anxious the closer I get to her room.



“Is something wrong?” Tate asks from behind me, and I tell him that something doesn’t feel right. Ashton pushes past me to open her bedroom door, and then it hits me.



I can barely smell the scent of my Daughter, and Sage starts to whimper in my head. Ashton is running around her room, saying that her stuff is missing. Her closet is nearly empty, as is her bathroom. Tate sends out a Pack-wide mind-link to get everyone to the Pack-house, and within seconds I can hear footsteps and paws pounding the stairs and the ground.

But no matter what, it’s stuck in Google purgatory—buried so deep even you can’t find it with a search.

So… what gives?

Marketing pro Helen Pollitt recently dropped a 16-point checklist of reasons your page might not be ranking—and some of them might surprise you. Here’s the TL;DR (with some Reddit-style real talk):

⸻

First, don’t panic—diagnose

Not ranking at all vs. ranking poorly = two different issues. Start by checking Google Search Console:
	•	Does your page get impressions or clicks?
	•	If not, Google might not even know it exists (ouch).
	•	If yes, but it’s low, something’s holding it back.

⸻

The Usual Suspects (aka Why Google Might Be Ghosting Your Page)

1. Technical SEO gremlins
Stuff like:
	•	Robots.txt blocking crawlers
	•	Page not indexed
	•	No internal links pointing to it
	•	Slow as molasses loading time
	•	Broken rendering or scripts that hide your content

2. Content isn’t hitting the mark
Ask yourself:
	•	Are you answering what users are actually searching for?
	•	Is your content format what Google wants (maybe it wants videos, not blogs)?
	•	Are you accidentally competing with your own pages (keyword cannibalization)?
	•	Does your content actually go deep enough to compete?

3. Your competition is just better (yeah, it sucks)
Sometimes the hard truth: their stuff is more useful, better-optimized, or simply gets more backlinks. Spy on what’s ranking and see where yours falls short.

4. Google’s trust issues (aka E-E-A-T)
Is your content:
	•	Written by someone with real expertise?
	•	Backed by credible sources or sites?
	•	Free of spammy vibes?

5. You blamed the algorithm too early
Yes, algorithm updates happen. But most ranking drops aren’t caused by that. Don’t use it as a scapegoat—do the groundwork first.

⸻

Pro Tips:
	•	Use Search Console like a detective, not a cheerleader.
	•	Look at intent behind the keywords you’re targeting. If someone’s searching “how to tie a tie,” don’t hit them with a blog about tie history.
	•	Be brutally honest when comparing your page with what’s ranking. What are they doing that you’re not?

⸻

Bottom line: ranking on Google isn’t just about writing something good—it’s about making sure Google thinks it’s the best answer out there. Sometimes it’s a quick fix. Sometimes it’s an overhaul. Either way, fixing it starts with figuring out what’s actually wrong.

If you’ve been stuck in the SEO trenches lately, what was the issue that finally unlocked rankings for you? Let’s swap stories.

We've known each other for four years, and since 16 he's been a weed addict, and the most intimate and longest relationship he had was with me, especially because he's known me longer than any other woman he has met. and I think he's not used to a real woman because he often dated girls younger than him.
He works, comes home and smokes. Besides he is working out everyday. He already said he will only smoke the test of the weed for this month. So the want for change is there. 

Anyways, after seven months no contact, we met up again last week, he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes. I asked him to get me flowers last week and we met up two days after that and no flowers. He reached out earlier than that, but I was dating another guy then. At home he was gaming while talking with me the whole time. I just think he's afraid of real “in the moment”- type of intimacy. He also told me I should tell him when it bothers me, and the next day I asked if we can watch a movie together he said “it’s not the right time for watching one”, and continued gaming. 

Every evening, he is on a team call with his brother and his friends after work. I mean, I also do participate in that, but I also have goals and stuff that I have to work on so I can't be on the team call every day like them like literally every every day in the evening they are gaming together. And he is smoking around 7-8 joints per day. When he doesn't smoke joints, he smokes cigarettes at work. 

He's a sweet, sensitive boy in his core, but outwards he wants to be the hood gangster lol. When we cuddle and I take his hand, I can feel that he's not used to this type of intimacy. I can just feel his energy getting shy, although in general he's a lot more affectionate than me.

His money is short because, usually he spent 400€ on just buying weed for a month. He even said he doesn’t want to spend money on useless coffee if we would go to a nice coffee shop. I just told him i want to do something, since he asked me to come over again. He said we can do what I want. But Idk if I should go over this week, cause I’m afraid he will say that he won’t pay for me. Currently I left him on read since yesterday he didnt reply to me because he “was gaming”. I gave him advice on his chronic tonsilitis, and like it seems he was too proud to go get some medicine yesterday. 

At his place when I was hungry and went to the fridge, he said since I’m his girlfriend now “I can also sometimes bring food or buy food if I’m going to eat at his place”. 
Well, then I went grocery shopping ALONE and bought some vegetables and meat, because he didn’t have those at home. And cooked for us.
He also wanted me to move in asap and said I should pay half the rent. If so, he has more money to get his drivers license.

I’m considering to pay for my stuff only from now on. But also I expect a boyfriend to pay for food. Especially when I gave him lots of my money the past years.
I also don’t like the idea of doing 50/50 on rent. Last week he asked me if its okay and I hesitated and said yes. But I’m not. I spent around 300 euros on his groceries the past years and invited him to dinners before. So no, I’m not okay with that.

If he stops smoking he will have enough money. But the question is if he would share it with me. Maybe my boundaries aren’t good enough. Advice?",2,1747131940.0,AITAH,30,0.75,False
