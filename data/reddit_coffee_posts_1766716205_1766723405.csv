The first couple of months were wonderful - the effects of stopping coffee completely were very noticable, with an amazing sense of calm throughout the day. 

  
The other day though I suddenly realized that I no longer consciously feel the benefits. This state just became my new normal. 

I realize that I must still be living much calmer, but the change is no longer noticable. 

  
I am still much calmer and my anxiety levels are much lower than before, especially in stressful days and social interactions. But I am no longer \_aware\_ of that.

1pvvd6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pvvd6c/bolivia_vs_colombia_after_peru_salkantay_trek/,Bolivia vs Colombia after Peru Salkantay trek,"Hi all,

I’m planning a 3.5 week honeymoon in South America (Sept–Oct) and would love some perspective from people who’ve done either or both options.

The Peru part of the trip is pretty much locked in:

* Lima (2 nights)
* Arequipa (3 nights, acclimating)
* Cusco + Sacred Valley (4 nights)
* 5-day Salkantay trek to Machu Picchu
* Night back in Cusco after the trek

After that, I’m deciding between **two very different second halves** and struggling to weigh uniqueness vs comfort and flow.

**Option A: Bolivia**

* Lake Titicaca
* La Paz
* Death Road
* 3-day Uyuni salt flats tour

This would obviously be higher altitude, colder, more rugged, but includes some once-in-a-lifetime landscapes, especially Uyuni.

**Option B: Colombia**

* Fly Cusco to Medellín
* Medellín (culture, food, day trips like Guatapé)
* Salento / Coffee Region (Cocora Valley, coffee farms, slower pace)

This feels warmer, more flexible, better food, and potentially more “honeymoon-friendly”, but maybe less singular than Uyuni.

We are from Australia and this is our first time in South America and will likely not get back to South America for many years. I like the idea of doing Bolivia now and doing a proper Colombia trip in the future but that could be a long way away. We’re experienced travellers and fine with adventure, though we have never done a multi-day trek. We value history, scenery, food and contemporary culture. This is a honeymoon, and it comes straight after a demanding multi-day trek, so recovery, enjoyment, and overall vibe matter as much as bucket-list value.

For people who’ve done:

* Uyuni and the Bolivia circuit, or
* Medellín + Salento, or
* Both

Which did you find more rewarding? Any regrets skipping one for the other?  
or do you have another suggestion?

Thank you in advance",2,1766722987.0,travel,3,1.0,False

1pvv6pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AugmentaHealth/comments/1pvv6pc/why_silence_is_actually_a_nutrient_for_your_brain/,"Why silence is actually a ""nutrient"" for your brain (and how to get more of it)","

We live in a world that is constantly screaming for our attention. Between podcasts, notifications, and background TV, most of us haven’t experienced true silence in weeks. We treat silence like ""empty space,"" but it’s actually one of the most productive things you can give your brain.

The Science Bit:

 🧠Neurogenesis: A 2013 study (published in Brain, Structure and Function) found that two hours of silence daily prompted the development of new cells in the hippocampus—the region of the brain related to memory and emotion.

😌The Default Mode Network (DMN): When it’s quiet, your brain switches to the DMN. This is where ""internal reflection"" happens. It’s how you process your day, solve problems, and spark creativity. Without silence, the DMN never gets to turn on.

 ☺️Lowering Cortisol: Research shows that silence is actually more relaxing for your body than ""relaxing"" music. It lowers blood pressure and reduces the stress hormone, cortisol, more effectively than many ""calming"" playlists.

🫡The Mental Health Benefit: Silence allows your ""mental sediment"" to settle. When you’re constantly consuming noise, you’re just pushing your thoughts and anxieties down. Silence lets them surface so you can actually deal with them, rather than just being distracted by them.

How to practice it (without being a monk):

🔟The ""First 10"" Rule: Don’t check your phone or turn on the radio for the first 10 minutes of your morning. Drink your coffee/tea in total silence.

🤫The Silent Commute: Try driving or taking the bus without music or a podcast. Just look out the window and let your mind wander. It feels awkward for the first 5 minutes, then it feels like a relief.

🎧Noise-Canceling Breaks: If you live in a loud city, use noise-canceling headphones for 15 minutes a day—but don't play any audio. Just enjoy the ""muted"" world.

🧘‍♀️The ""Gap"" Practice: Before you start a new task, sit for 60 seconds in silence. It acts as a ""palette cleanser"" for your brain.

Silence isn't just the absence of noise; it's the presence of clarity. Your brain needs it to repair itself.

I am a long time craft beer drinker, first time homebrewer. I've brewed with a friend before on his 5-gal setup with our own recipes, but now just got my first 1 gal kit from Northern Brewing.

 I've got the basic equipment and other stuff (whirlflock, dryhop bag/magnets, and weighing scales down to mgs for salt accuracy) and others like 2 1 gal carboy spigot fermentors, and an Inkbird alongside a fridge for temp-controlled fermenting. So I have some to start with, except no kegging or closed loop transfers; for now I'll just be doing standard bottling, and Id rather get good at the basics.

What are good beer styles that I can make with this setup and start on, from beginner to medium complexity? I'm not looking to start super complex with dry hopped hazies or BA stouts. Honestly fine starting simple with robust beer styles and those less suceptible to oxidation.  As I get more familiar, moving from there to more complex stuff that requires whirlpool/temp control fermenting/kettle souring/etc, but obviously not all at once.

I like most beer styles besides BA (lager, pilsner, IPA, stout, sour, really anything), so not a problem here, but unfortunately I'm not a huge fan of standard English ales, which I know is more commonly started in for ease. However if it's gotta any coffee/chocolate notes I can get behind like an amber/Brown ale.

Appreciate any advice on where to start. Thanks for your time!

I have a $14,000 cash budget, but I am paralyzed by the thought of committing. In the past week, I’ve been on a 2023 Honda cb650r, Royal Enfield Bear 650, Himalayan, ‘26 Scrambler 400xc, and Trident 660.

I like naked bikes and the classic look of the cb650r. Same with the Trident. I like modern classics like the scrambler/cafe racer types. I like muscle bikes like the HD Sportster S. The 750 Hornet gets amazing reviews even if its looks aren’t my favorite.

I have over 200 acres I can play on but would need to ride to get there. I don’t like loading up dirt bikes or keeping them on site away from where I live. I don’t like the looks of most ADV bikes.

I have a group of friends that ride who are older and level headed with over a decade of experience. I may do 1 or 2 tour trips with them (like 2-3 day trips tops) a year. 90% of my riding will be to a buddy’s house/coffee shop good weather weekend rides with maybe the occasional commute.

I sat on a Scrambler 1200xe. It’s 3.75” shorter than the KTM, but I’m on the balls of both feet touching. It’s a smaller seat height than dirt bikes I’ve been on but is heavier. Do I jump in with both feet and get a gently used Scrambler 1200xe? Stick with the CB650 or Hornet for now? Get a used cheap bike under $6k until Spring and then trade it in? Or just forget about this journey because I’m nearly 50 and this is crazy?

I love Triumph but the dealer is 2.5hrs away (they will include a roadside assistance package that will tow to the nearest authorized service center). How big of a deal will this be?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I have no regrets I got fired for being sick for the days,  because my ex exec chef is a true cunning runt. She really broke me.  I was becoming agoraphobic working under her. The two months I was looking for work,  it got worse.  I almost didn't go to my job interview... Thank God I did. It saved me. 

I found my people at my new job.  I've been teaching myself Spanish because a) fuck you dad,  for not doing it and b) I WANT to communicate with the people I work with. I heart them. 
I began El Día de los Muertos Antes Navidad on October 15th. It's my third year of practicing this coping with your loss skill. My 2 foot fake tree is covered in Day of the Dead ornaments and has your flask,  a coffee cup,  some prerolls and a pipe beneath it.  It's not for presents,  it's because I love you and miss you. 
I didn't throw anything at anyone for loving Christmas. I stayed in today.  I ordered Chinese takeout. I smoked some weed and thought about the fact it's been ten years and this is the only place I feel comfortable writing about you anymore because even though you weren't around long enough to know these are our people... these are our people.  Many of them know Mel and have toasted to our friendship out of compassion and empathy. 
So even though ten years has kicked me in my face...I still have to mention you here today. 
I made it this far without crying,  but now the years are slow and silent. 
I'll never stop grieving you,  loving you,  or being grateful for the 25 years you were my ride or die.
I miss you everyday. I talk to you under the stars at the witching hours still...
Merry Christmas.
Cheers
and

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I dont think I look good, I do project good energy and friendly and have a bunch of hobbies and basically can talk about all the stuff this universe can suggest.

When I had a girlfriend I was up in the sky, I was so happy. Things went downhill and me mistreating her caused her to breakup with me, I am to blame. I learned a lot, I went to therapy to solve all those shitty parts in me.

But I am still sad, no woman in my life. No one that hugs me.

I am now dating a new girl (we are 7 months post breakup) and yet again I feel relieved, like hey, I have (the beginning) of a new relationship!

Or for example, there is still girl I worked with and she has a boyfriend for a long time, she texts me every once in a while to grab coffee, ngl I see it as a burden because it’s nothing romantic, but deep inside I want to go, I am curious why she invites me, why she misses me (she said it), but I know she still has a boyfriend and they are strongly together, so nothing really is going to happen… 

You get me? I need that attention otherwise i feel ugly, unwanted, unworthy… but on the other hand I know nothing good will be the outcome…

How do I stop fucking living like a pussy that needs validation from third parties all the time.. how do I build a mind so strong that even “alone” is fine?

I came back from a long solo trip, it was fun and taught me how to be alone and how to deal with life alone in a different country.. but the feeling of im ugly unwanted still there over my head. ",0,1766721787.0,Advice,1,0.5,False

This is my first build of this sort of kit (which requires glue -- felt like *so* much glue, though it looks like I only went through about 15-20ml).  My previous experience has mostly been with UGEARS kits, which just slot together without any glue.

Still, I think it came together reasonably well.  Instructions were pretty clear, though I did make a few goofs.  That frosted glass effect on the front door was because that's one of the first things I glued, and it didn't go too well and got smeared everywhere.  That's totally on me, though.

Another goof was the base of the cash register, which is supposed to be wrapped with a black sticker to hide the wood, but I completely overlooked that step.  Finally, they supplied some tape with the kit to help keep the internal wiring in place, but I didn't realise that's what it was (it just looked like a blank sticker sheet) so I used my own tape, which I suspect isn't going to work as well in the long run.  A few other times I messed something up but I was able to disassemble and fix it before getting too far ahead (or letting the glue set).

There's a couple of things I do blame on the kit itself, though: one is that one of the little screws for the top hinges was completely missing the actual screwdriver slots (thankfully mitigated because they did include spares in the kit), and the other is that those little red grasses in the front were quite difficult to get off their backing paper (which wasn't shown in the instructions so I wasn't sure if I was doing it right at first) and the red bits come off way too easily and end up scattered everywhere.

The kit includes screwdriver, tweezers, lighting kit, tape (though I didn't realise that at first).  You need to separately supply glue and 2xAAA batteries.  Also a mini-candle if you want to wax up any parts, which I did do but I don't think anything strictly needed it.

1pvurzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/exAdventist/comments/1pvurzg/vetting_sda_pastors/,Vetting SDA pastors,"The post beneath mine about the pastors vs doctors got me thinking about an SDA pastor i know who has absolutely no business being a pastor. It makes me wonder how do they vet people before giving them a congregation to be in charge of?

Here’s a bit of my story . (Apologies for the length of the post , it’s a lot) 

**Also TW: some of what I am going to write involves stories that include SA.** 

This SDA pastor is a guy I used to date. We got together when we were both 18 (this was obviously before he was a pastor) and I didn’t particularly want a relationship with him but he was extremely pushy about being official so I gave in.

Our first kiss was not consensual. I had still been under the effects of purity culture and I had wanted to wait a bit before having our first kiss. I had told him this. Didn’t stop him from trying? No. He would try and I would pull away and say “no, I want to wait.” Well one night we were sitting on the front porch and he leaned over to kiss me. I pulled away and tried to turn my head but he grabbed my head forcefully and planted one on me as I tried to turn away. So that was our first kiss. Romantic, right?

From then on I said “fuck it, I guess we’re kissing now.” However after doing that for a bit eventually he wanted more. I would say no and resist. He would not let up until I would finally comply.  He was raised in the SDA church but left as a teenager to rebel and then around the time we together  he had experienced a come to Jesus moment and was an “on fire for God, new Christian” type. 

Yet that didn’t stop him from pushing himself on me sexually. One time he kept trying to get me to touch his dick. He would grab my hand and place it there. I would pull it off. So he would do it again and again. Then the final time he put my hand there, I tried to pull it away but he used physical force as I resisted with all my strength . He physically forced my hand there. That’s when I was like “ok fuck it, I guess we’re doing this now .” He would wear me down until I would give in. 

This was how every sexual experience started initially. He wanted to do something I wasn’t ready to do. I would resist and say no. He would push and push until I finally gave in. This kept happening and progressing until we eventually had sex. 

At this time he was going to college to study to become an SDA pastor. He loved to talk about God and spiritual things and act holy and fake in front of others, but little did they know what he did behind closed doors. He was also extremely emotionally abusive. He would gaslight me until I was convinced the things I was upset about had been imagined, he would stonewall me and pretend I wasn’t in the room and didn’t exist as a way to punish me (if I had upset him in any way). He was a man child in every way but extremely abusive psychologically. 

Eventually I couldn’t take it any more and 3 years into being together I ended it for good. He cried and screamed and threatened to kill himself. 

One of the things that was the final straw for me was one night we were in the basement bedroom at his parents house about to head back to college from winter break the next day. We had been having sex off and on in the relationship but I had felt guilty about it and had told him I didn’t want to do it anymore. Well, that night he got on top of me and I tried to push him off and say no. He tried to pry my legs open and I forcefully tried to keep them closed so he couldn’t pry them open. But he kept trying and using force. At that point I lost it and kicked him as hard as I could to where he fell backwards on the bed. I yelled “I said NO.” He walked away like a wounded puppy and slept upstairs. The next day on our road trip back to college I was driving (the full 10 hour drive) and he refused to speak to me. I begged and pleaded with him to talk through these issues and have a conversation with me. He refused and wouldn’t look at me or respond to me or acknowledge my existence (punishment for me kicking him off). 

So after I broke up with him he refused to respect boundaries I put up and called me crying nonstop sobbing and begging. He lost so much weight and became emaciated from being unable to eat. He told me that I can’t leave him because biblically it’s wrong seeing as we had sex and now we are married in gods eyes. 

Eventually he moved on. At this point he had graduated theology school and was working as a chaplain at an SDA academy. 

He started dating this girl who had recently graduated from the academy and had conveniently just turned 18. I did the math and pieced some things together and realized that they must have been seeing each other when she was a minor and attending the academy. He simply wanted to wait to make it official I’m guessing . But I’m 99% convinced that this guy , who was in his mid 20s and staff at this academy, had been grooming this 16/17 year old student so they could then become official once she was legal. 

She was young and naive, and probably felt special that this cute chaplain at her school noticed her and liked HER out of alllll the other girls there. This is exactly how groomers operate and they even will tell the minor female things like “you’re so mature for your age.” I imagine he smooth talked her and pressured her.

They are now married, and have 5 young children. He has been a pastor at an SDA church for a while now.

I feel sorry for this girl being trapped in this marriage with an absolute narcissist and having 5 kids which likely makes her even more trapped. 

Maybe he’s changed and doesn’t emotionally abuse her like he did to me but I don’t believe someone like him is capable of change.

I remember when he was studying to be a pastor (when we dated) he would lecture me about how I shouldn’t be listening to secular music . Also how I shouldn’t drink coffee or eat meat or dairy. Yet on occasion I would catch him drinking alcohol and smoking weed or cigarettes.

I have remained in touch with his family on and off  through the years (they cared about me and hated that he treated me the way he did, but they also enable him to an extent). His brother in law told me how a couple years ago my ex the “O’ so holy pastor” got absolutely blackout drunk at his mother’s birthday party. So the same man who probably teaches the youth at his church not to drink or have premarital sex was doing all of those things. I’m pretty sure him and his now wife had sex while dating which is also when he was a pastor. 

The point I’m trying to make with telling this story is that this is the type of person who the SDA church allows to be pastors. Granted, they would have no way of knowing many of these things when they hired him. They can only vet someone so much I suppose and someone like this guy is very sneaky and fake. But still. It’s unsettling to think that there are probably thousands of pastors in the church who have done similar things yet still manage to keep their jobs or avoid being exposed. I’m not sure what the solution would be but you’d think they’d be able to come up with a better system when it comes to vetting them.  

Either way I am glad I am out of that relationship as well as out of that church. 

If you made it this far I apologize for writing an entire manuscript but this is my first time ever writing this experience out and I kept remembering new things I had forgotten through the years.

I hope everyone  has had a very merry Christmas and I am thankful for this sub and everyone in it. Being able to post here and read others stories and posts has helped me tremendously ❤️",2,1766721028.0,exAdventist,0,1.0,False

Question: what is the sweetest coffee you have had? What were the taste notes? What would you recommend as my next sweet coffee?

Here are some tips on getting better,"I feel extremely sad for all of us. My case is far better than it was earlier. Dunno what caused it but the journey to betterment is on. It will probably never go away but here's how I managed it so far:
1. Take the tabs, don't miss me ever (Mirabegron since a year now, Alfusin for about 6 months and stopped)
2. Be patient. Learn to Navigate the crisis, it's a long road to betterment
3. Change habits. For me, I ate cleaner, drank water in high volumes twice a day (once when I wake, so that I empty my bladder before I leave for office, once at the last few hours of office so that you can empty thebladder once home. This way I avoided frustration at work and postponed/preponed it. This makes you tired soon but manage like this for 6 months)
4. Reduce alcohol intake and any other irritant. My case alcohol was an irritant, so was tea and coffee and juice etc. this infact improved my other health conditions thankfully. So collateral kill (yayy)
5. Exercise. I had an ACL reconstruction at the same period. So had to mandatorily do Physio. Informed the physio of my bladder issue and he would have me do some exercises for the same. That probably helped.
6. Keep in touch with the doc on a monthly/bi monthly basis. Don't think it's a waste of the consultation fee. See him/her online if that's cheaper. 
7. Don't get lazy. Life is short as it is. Don't waste it being sad and playing victim. Fight it. Be strong folks.

Easier said than done. It will get better slowly.
For those with severe issues of the bladder. I am so sorry, may you get better soon :)

I’m a student building a small experiment and wanted honest feedback before I take it further.

the idea is pretty simple:  
an AI matchmaker that pairs you with one new person on campus and sets you up to meet over coffee.

you’d:

* fill out a short form
* get matched with someone you’d probably get along with
* get a suggested coffee spot + time
* and decide if you want to go or not

the motivation is that meeting new people should be easier but right now it mostly happens by accident or through apps that feel exhausting.

I’m genuinely curious:

* would you try something like this?

I’m starting this on a budget and I’ve narrowed down to two machines. The Bezzera Duo De and the La spaziale Vivaldi 2 (also branded as Lucca a53 in the US). Running on a 15amp - does anyone have any experience running either machines at high volume for 1-2 hrs? Both these machines are about the same price here in Canada right now. I like to go with the 58mm group size with the Bezzera but I’m not sure if it can keep up at 15amp serving back to back drinks. Whereas the Vivaldi 2 I am seeing it being used on carts in the US and Canada.

1pvukf4,https://i.redd.it/2rzobmanyg9g1.jpeg,2025 Coffee and Gear Haul,"A lot of good coffee. I got into home roasting. Still a lot to learn. Bought some good things. Some used some new. Some really good deals.

Not pictured. Because I forgot to save the packages:

 

\- 5 pounds of Mexican decaf from FRC

\- 5 pounds of unroasted Sugarcane decaf from FRC

\- 5 pounds of vesta decaf 

\- The counter culture fast forward label represents about 10 pounds (5 pounds left) of vacuum packed in the freezer.

\- The PERC decaf at the back represents 5 pounds (1 bag left) 

\- The mothership atlas light is a 5 pound bag that I just started (the rest is vacuum sealed in the freezer)

\- One bag of intelligencia house blend.

\- the Buenos Dias light roast was a 4 pound pack from Costco. I really liked it. 

\- James’ decaf project.

Things I learned this year: 

\- Roasting is fun. Harder than I thought. But fun.

\- Generally, I prefer Washed to Naturals, not in every case but mostly.

 \- I am open to co-ferments. PERC’s cinnamon was great. The luminous is a watermelon and is also good. 

\- I don’t think my palate is sensitive enough to notice the difference in water. Filtered vs bottled vs third wave vs tap, I can’t tell the difference. 

\- I actually like espresso milk drinks. I had several cortados and lattes that were great. 

\- The type of decaf doesn’t matter as much as I thought. I did like the EA and Co2 more but it was by a small margin.

I apparently really like coffees from the Brazilian state Minas Gerais. Mothership’s Atlas light, PERC’s Legender and FRC’s Brazil are all from there and will all be bought again. 

\- The prismo tastes different than inverted. Maybe a little extra filtering, not sure.

\- That buying the thing that you really want the first time might actually be cheaper than trying get a cheap alternative first, it breaking or sucking then having to buy the thing anyways. I learned that lesson with a roaster, kettle, a mug and some glasses.

\- That I bought way more than I thought. This is the fourth photo I took because I kept having to add things, I know I will remember stuff after I post it too. There are definitely some coffees I bought that I didn’t save the packaging that I can’t remember. 

Things I am looking forward to in 2026:

\- I have PERCs peach co-ferment waiting in the freezer. 

\- I have my eye on a blueberry co-ferment from Vesta. 

\- A lot of unroasted coffee to try and roast.

\- Trying new roasters

\- I really want to try Jamaican, Real Kona, and Asian country coffees. I have mostly tried coffee from the Americas and Africa. Any suggestions are welcome!

1pvuj92,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1pvuj92/grandmothers_confession/,Grandmother's Confession,"The family had all gathered at Mrs. Iris Kingswells household. She wanted them all here for her last moments, for Iris felt she would soon pass away from this world. Her family members took turns speaking with Iris and spending time with her. Colton, her oldest grandson, was the last to enter her room.

""Colton, please have a seat,"" Iris spoke softly, her voice hoarse, motioning to a chair. ""How are you feeling, grandma?"" he asked, sitting with a frown.

""I'm alright, but I need to tell you something."" Iris then added, ""Something significant.""

""Should I go get Mom? ""Colton said, going to stand, and his grandmother shook her head. ""No, this is something I want to tell you only.""

Iris smiled, and he leaned back in his chair, nodding. ""Okay. What do you want to tell me?""

A sigh of relief escaped his grandmother's lips as she began to tell her story. When Iris was growing up, her only companion was her father since her mother had passed away when she was young. As she grew older, however, her father fell in love with a woman in their small town. Iris knew her father wouldn't be alone forever and had to accept that he would start dating again.

This woman, however, made Iris's skin crawl. But she was willing to push that aside if her father was happy.

Or until one night when Iris suddenly awoke from a deep sleep. She saw Vidya, her father's girlfriend, walk past her open bedroom door and down the hallway, her eyes glowing. Sitting upright in bed, Iris watched this woman approach her father's bedroom.

Slowly getting out of bed, Iris tiptoed quietly down the hall.

She stopped watching from her father's open doorway. His girlfriend is standing at the end of his bed, just staring at him. Taking a step back, the floorboard under her foot creaked, and Vidya snapped her head in the direction of the sound.

Cursing, Iris tried to sink into the hallway's darkness as much as she could. The woman smiled, mouthing, ""I see you."" Before Vidya could follow her, Iris ran to her room and hid under her covers, only having a tiny opening to peep out of. A thudding of footsteps came down the hallway, stopping at Iris's open door. ""Iris,"" a voice called to her in a hiss.

*Go away, Go away, Go away.*

Closing her eyes as tightly as she could. Iris prayed that Vidya would leave. There was a task, and Vidya clicked her tongue in disappointment. The woman left her doorway, and Iris peeked her head out, sighing in relief. Vidya had left. Why had she been here in the first place?

In the morning, Iris spoke to her father about what had happened the previous night. ""Dad, did you invite Vidya to spend the night?""

""Hm? No, I didn't. Why do you ask?""

""She was here last night.""

Her father furrowed his brow and lowered his coffee cup.

""What do you mean she was here?"" he asked confused.

Iris fidgeted in her seat, looking down at the table.

""Last night, I saw Vidya inside the house. She walked through the halls and stood at the foot of your bed, her eyes glowing yellow."" Her father laughed. ""Her eyes were glowing. Iris, you had to be dreaming."" ""But I wasn't!"" she stood, slamming her hands on the table.

The medium-sized round table shook, causing her empty glass to topple over and roll across the floor. Iris's father stood to his full height, casting a shadow over her. ""Go to your room,"" he instructed.

She knew without even looking at his face that he was angry. Without a word, she turned, leaving the dining room and upstairs into her bedroom. Iris shut her door and screamed into her hands, frustrated. How could she prove that Vidya was here?

She paced the carpeted floor of her bedroom, running her hands through her hair, rattled with nervousness. An old camcorder, once her mother's, was stored in the attic; she could set it up to catch Vidya entering their home. Then, her father would have to believe her.

Right?

Hearing the front door close signaled that her father had left. Iris snuck out of her room and up the stairs into the attic. Going through the boxes with her mother's name on them, she found the old cam recorder and the charging cord.

Now, she had to find out where to set it up without her father finding it and taking it down. That night, they ate dinner silently, neither wanting to speak to each other. As she put her dishes in the sink, her father said goodnight, and she went to her room.

Iris settled into bed and slept, feeling mental and physical exhaustion wash over her. That night would be the last time she would see her father. Looking back on it, Iris wished she had at least said I love you one last time.

She was awoken by the sound of crunching and slurping. A gurgling sound was coming from down the hall. Iris's heart thumped in her chest as she scrambled out of bed and grabbed the hidden camera. She crept slowly down the hall, her breathing ragged, tiptoeing towards her father's room.

Aiming at the camera inside, she pointed it into the darkness. Looking through the lens, she saw it. Vidya was eating her father. She was tall and hunched over her fingers, long with talons for fingernails. Vidya's bloody mouth was full of rows of sharp teeth with pieces of flesh stuck between them.

Her head cocked to the side, listening as she chewed, and then it jerked in Iris's direction. Iris held her breath, hoping Vidya would not see her, but she was wrong. The woman stood upright, and what looked like feathers stuck around her as she approached the door. She needed to run away from Vidya, so she did, with the camera tucked under her arm. Iris ran down the stairs as her father's bedroom door burst open, and a wrapped cry escaped the woman who chased after her.

The young girl just needed to get out the front door and make her way to the neighbor's house, and she would be safe. She got swatted like a fly against a wall, which caused her to drop the camera. Iris needed to defend herself, fumbling around in the dark. She grabbed the baseball bat her father kept behind the door in case of intruders and swung with all her might.

*Thwack Thwack Thwack*

Each time the young girl swung, the bat made contact, making a sickening, wet, and crunching sound. Iris opened her eyes, which she didn't know were closed, and dropped the bat from her hands. There on the ground was Vidya's unconscious form.

Colton was on the edge of his seat as his grandmother paused. ""What happened after that?"" he asked. ""I called the police, and they came to the house to investigate taking Vidya's body away. Along with the cam recorder. My home turned into a giant crime scene."" Iris replied.

Colton became silent as he watched his grandmother close her eyes.

""I lost my father that night all because of that monster."" her voice was a low whisper now.

""Grandma?""

""I'm alright, my boy. I'm just exhausted. Will you tell your mother to come sit with me?"" Iris requested.

Colton nodded and stood from his chair, walking towards the door.

He looked over his shoulder at his grandmother before entering the crowded room of people soaking in what she had told him. Had all this really happened to her? What was that creature that she saw? As he approached his mother, Colton, she was standing with someone he didn't know. Everything about this man was clean-cut and perfect, yet something about his smile seemed overly practiced.

His mother introduced him as Ivan.

""Grandma wants you,"" Colton interjected before his mother could explain who Ivan was.

She blinked in surprise and nodded, apologizing to the man, who shook his head. She blinked in surprise and nodded, apologizing to the man, who shook his head and watched as she walked away. Ivan's expression changed to that of a predator being interrupted from a meal.

""I don't know who you are, but stay away from my mother,"" Colton warned. Ivan laughed, crossing his arms. His eyes had a sheen of gold on them. He leaned in close to the young man, his voice barely above a whisper, ""Your mother is a grown woman and can make decisions for herself, Colton.""

Colton swallowed the hard lump in his throat, standing before the man unflinching. The young man would face Ivan head-on if it was a fight he wanted; then it was a fight he was going to get. He would defeat this creature and save his mother from its clutches. Colton was determined not to fail.",1,1766720239.0,RedditHorrorStories,0,1.0,False

1pvucvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1pvucvx/the_tuscan_game/,The Tuscan Game,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.

They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.

One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.

“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.

It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.

“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”

“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”

They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:

Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.

A wave of excitement washed over them.

“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”

“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”

Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:

“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”

“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.

The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it, was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.

With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.

“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”

They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.

A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.

“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”

A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.

“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.

The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”

“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”

“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”

“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”

“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.

“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”

“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”

“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.

“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”

“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”

“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.

“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.

“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”

Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”

A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.

As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”

“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom

They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.

The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.

“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”

“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”

They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.

It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.

“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”

“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.

Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.

“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.

“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”

They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.

It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.

They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.

“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”

With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.

Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.

The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.

The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.

“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.

“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.

“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”

“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”

“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.

“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”

The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.

“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”

He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.

“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.

“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.

The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.

A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.

""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.

""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""

A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,

No Service.

His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""

""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.

""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""

Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.

Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.

He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.

He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.

""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""

At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.

Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.

The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.

A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.

The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""

Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.

As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.

Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.

""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.

Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.

She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described. As a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud

Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.

She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her from grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface stirred, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.

""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment.""

There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""

He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.

Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium. The page loaded a list of stories, and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration. He opened a fresh document on his computer and began to take notes, his fingers flying across the keyboard, already building the foundations of his next masterpiece.

I think the back of the trailer is prime marketing real estate when we are transporting the trailer. I think phone number, instagram handle, an website are more important in that order. We have limited space. If we can have QR code in addition to phone number website and instagram handle then fine. But just the QR code sounds like a terrible idea.

I am tracking at or ahead of the roadmap for Level 5. I plan to really emphasize reading for a while. With regard to listening, I will likely largely lean on DS and a favorite learner podcast as I work in more authentic Spanish content, rather than seeking out new learner podcasts. This just seems the most time efficient thing to me.

The only way you will fail is to give up!

=================================

Now for the long version. First, for my background:  
I am not a purist. I had started studying Spanish in earnest before I found out about DS and I saw no reason to stop learning about grammar or speaking to fit my learning into the DS box. I have said this a few times in other posts, but I see the greatest value of DS being their catalogue of videos that are a great toolbox that we can use as we see fit. At the end of the day, I am here to learn Spanish and enrich my life, not to prove some didactic theory right or wrong. 

By already having a sold grasp of most forms of grammar (my ability to use the subjunctive is limited) when I started watching DS content, I think the scaffolding for absorbing vocab was already there for me when I started. I also spoke from almost day one of my Spanish study, and I reject the necessity of waiting as long as the roadmap says, IF you have a way to check and correct your pronunciation. Considering the quality of accent of people who waited as DS recommends ranges from amazing to downright awful, accent quality seems largely down to factors beyond simply total CI input.

**Next up, how do I compare to Level 5 on the roadmap?**  


*You can understand people well when they speak directly to you.*

100% true.



*They won’t need to adapt their speech for you.*

Eh, mostly true but we can’t always know if someone is adapting their speech for us. Though I interact with plenty of Spanish speakers who definitely don’t care I am not native and get it full bore. Even if occasionally I don’t get 100% of what is said, I always get the gist or more. So, can probably call this true.



*Understanding a conversation between native speakers is still hard.*

This can be true. If it is teenagers with slang, it is tough. If it is like a couple chatting behind me in line at the grocery store, it is a mixed bag. It leans more towards hard, but occasionally I have real clarity. I definitely can say it depends a lot on the accent and context. Colombians and Mexicans, I could eavesdrop all day. With porteños in Argentina, it is definitely on the tougher end.



*You’ll almost understand TV programs in the language, because you understand so many of the words, but they are still hard enough to leave you frustrated or bored.*

I watched a few random TV episodes just as a level check over the last couple hundred hours. One funny thing is that I used to be a big foreign movie watcher and always chose subs over dubs, and usually watch English language content with subtitles anyway since sound-mixing is now a lost art. I actually do not plan to have TV watching as part of my DS/CI journey because why would I opt to not use subtitles in Spanish if I use them in English? And if I am using subtitles, I wouldn’t count it as CI.



*Conversation can be tiresome, and if you try to speak you can feel a bit like a child, since it will be hard to express abstract concepts and complex thoughts. You understand most of the words used during daily conversation, but you still can’t use many yourself. If you try to speak the language, it will feel like you are missing many important words. However, you can, often, already speak with the correct intonation patterns of the language, without knowing why, and even make a distinction between similar sounds in the language when you say them out loud.*

None of this applies. Since I have been speaking as much as I can in every context for over a year now, I am well beyond this. I can express myself pretty fully in most contexts. I use Tandem and talk to a variety of people from across the Spanish speaking world. I travel semi-regularly for work to a few parts of Latin America (mainly to Argentina, Mexico, and Colombia) and do everything I can to talk to people in all these places. Small talk at a bus stop, asking for directions in the metro even if I know the way, asking strangers in the supermarket which brand of whatever is better even if I know what I want to buy already. But including the various countries of people I talk with from Tandem, I engage fairly regularly with Mexicans, Colombians, Chileans, Argentines, Ecuatorians, Paraguayans, Uruguayans, and Spaniards. Other than occasionally getting teased if I use the “wrong” word for using say, a Colombian or Argentine word with a Spaniard, I genuinely cannot recall the last time someone could not understand me or even had struggles understanding me. I am not exactly changing the world with the quality of my rhetoric and definitely could speak more elegantly, but as far as this prompt goes, I am good to go.  About the biggest thing  can say here is that I am not necessarily a great Spanish conversationalist first thing in the morning, though that maybe applies to my English too...



One counter-intuitive thing I want to share with people who have more limited opportunities to engage with native speakers, is to recognize that longer conversations can be much easier. If you and I sit for coffee for an hour, I am roughly half of it and can help guide it and the more you talk, the more context I have to understand. Say you are telling me a story about something that happened at work yesterday that takes five minutes. That is a lot of time, a lot of verbs, for me to pick up what is going on and piece it together. If, instead, it is a short one or two sentences said to me on the street, I may miss half of it and you move on before I have a chance to recover. It is a funny thing that I have had days where I had a three hour conversation with someone, face to face, with no real issues and then completely blanked at some guy asking me which way to somewhere because I wasn’t really locked in for hearing unexpected Spanish.  
  
Typing that made me take a peak at the level 6 descriptors that come at 1,000 hours:  
“*You can really have fun with the language at this point. You are conversationally fluent for daily purposes of living in the country and you can get by at the bank, at the hospital, at the post office, or looking for an apartment to rent. In spite of that odd word that is not quite there when you need it, you can always manage to get your point across in one way or another, and by now you are already making complex longer phrases. At this level, for the first time, you start feeling like you are actually thinking about what you want to say, and not about how you want to say it, even though you may fall back on thinking about how you say things, especially in stressful situations or when feeling self-conscious.*”  
This already applies to me, say 95%. I handle all my business abroad with mostly no issues unless I meet someone with an extremely unfamiliar accent, or if they are very old. Not being an ageist, but some people just lose strength in their voice as they age and it can be tough.  
  
“*Using humor in the language is much easier now. You can understand TV shows about daily life quite well (80 to 90%). Shows about families, friends, etc. Unscripted shows will usually also be easier to understand than scripted shows, as long as they are not too chaotic or rely too much on cultural knowledge. Thrillers and other genres will still be hard.*”

Again, I don’t really mess with TV. Maybe after 800 hours I will try it out.  
  
Interesting, if I had to really do my best to add however many hours I had outside of DS (before starting random conversations and reading recently), it would be between 375 and 425 hours at the highest end I could plausibly count. Which would put me right around the 1,000 hour mark.

I guess really I am continuing to track time because I want to see how much my global understanding increases. Maybe I am lucky and continue to feel I am tracking a level ahead. If I were living in Mexico or Colombia full-time and never had to engage with teenagers or old people, I’d probably feel “done” if I accepted I'd always watch TV/movies with Spanish subtitles on.  But maybe this next stretch will help me smooth over the rest. I have had a few interesting engagements with really tough to understand speakers who I have run into roughly every other month since earlier this year. Each time they got so much easier to comprehend that it was almost hard to believe they weren’t messing with me. Obviously our progress is not linear, but I am curious to see how things continue to improve, or potentially plateau.

  
**What I am Listening To**:  
I have started to feel pretty picky with learner podcasts. I prefer to stick with DS a little longer until I can go more directly to content made for natives. Efficiency counts for something, and I am tired of how many start with the same sorts of topics.  At least with DS, the slope continues upward.  
  
Granted, I have mainly been sticking to Argentine-options, but the only one I proactively like is Español al Vuelo.  
  
Argentalk seems to be not the best quality audio

Traé Alfajores is annoyingly short episodes relative to the lengthy intro and outro

Pocket Spanish sounds to me to have a vaguely French pronunciation that I do not care for. I even shared it with some French people I know living in Argentina and they felt the same. I will accept he is a porteño but something about his voice does not do it for me. We have a right to be picky!

Español Desde Al Sur does not have their podcast on Apple, so I found it annoying.  
  
I could go on, but at a certain point, I have to accept it is not an issue with the content but with where I am in relation to it that is making me so unexpectedly picky. I just don’t want to start new “relationships” with content that are largely going to follow that same beginner Spanish arc.

Going forward, I want to focus on transitioning to authentic content for natives, and will likely only stick to Español al Vuelo for new episodes, and the occasional accent-focused push ahead of travel to a place with a challenging accent (Domincan Republic, Chile, Cuba, etc….) since that is about the only learner podcast I have really enjoyed on its own merits.

I think I am just craving “the real deal” and some of the following content creators are where I have started to do some of my regular listening.  
  
jefillysh – I will note she is at the very tip top of my comprehension right now. I need to be rested and locked in, but when I meet those criteria, I am good to go. Anything less and I lose the story quickly. If my listening improves to where she is slowed down, say 10%, I think it would be pretty chill for me.

La Hiperactina – similar to the above

dinosaur vlogs – At around 400 hours, I made this post: [Intermediate Grind Tip](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1nux9v0/intermediate_grind_tip_lean_into_the_playback/)

To save you a click, a random dinosaur vlogs video for me was comprehensible between 60-80% for the entire video if I watched it at .8x speed. Recently, I tried a different episode and it was around 90% comprehensible for me at full speed, or 95% if at .9 speed. So, an interesting marker of my listening progress.

  
Historia en Podcast – He is very new to me, but seems pretty comprehensible so far. A backlog of well over 200 episodes of longform content. This could be a good one for me.

Others I will list just in case they are of interest for people reading that are all Rioplatense are Un Mundo Inmenso, Es un Crimen, Comadre, and Historias Que Molestan. I have not listened to any of those yet except Un Mundo Inmenso (a fun geography channel), but had seen them mentioned in other posts and I plan to check them out down the road. Basically, for the places I spend time in the hispanohablante world, Mexican and Colombian Spanish are “easy” mode, and I just want Argentina to get to that same level.  

I had a post before of skipping from DS level 57 to 65 to keep things from being too bored, and that helped a lot. Though as I work in more authentic Spanish content, I may lower my DS listening down to lowest available to smooth things over. Some of the things above really drain the listening battery fast, so I reserve the right to change my mind on the ratios of what I listen too, haha.

**To summarize**: Some mix of DS and Español al Vuelo as new episodes drop along with rotating and working in the above authentic native content.

**What I am Reading**:  
I have around 230,000 words read and use the reading log linked on the DS site to track.  
  
Pro-tip: One location in a kindle book is worth18-22 words, so I always just multiply locactions by 20 and feel that is close enough for tracking purposes. I read a bundle of adapted A1 through B1 readers when I randomly got a month of Kindle Unlimited for free, along with some Paco Ardit and a few news articles. I did have some false starts in reading with the first A Series of Unfortunate Events book and one Dahl book. Both were readable in a sense of “I am getting the gist” and I could have told you what was happening, but my comprehension was fairly low. So I decided to do with reading what the advice in listening is, and go easier.

Level 5 for “What you Need to do” says ""If you want to start reading, by this point you'll be able to understand books targeted at children of lower grade levels, and you can skip over graded readers."" This is welcome news because the graded readers were killing me. So boring!

I have been reading the Magic Tree House books in Spanish. They are, for me, much more enjoyable than even higher level graded readers. That said, they are not the most thrilling reads. What I like is the repetition. The arc of each story is fairly similar, you will quickly lock in a lot of the preterite ways of saying “he said, “she added, “ etc...it is funny how you notice certain words an author uses a lot. But it is going quite well. I always read on WiFi and am not shy about looking up the translation on my kindle if I can’t guess a words meaning from context or want to understand a full phrase. With some lookups, I can usually knock a book out in an hour or hour and a half. If I read straight through, it would likely be closer to 45 minutes. It is worth noting that the books each go a tad faster due to the repetition of some vocab and grammatical structures.

**What is next reading wise?** I plan to read a Magic Tree House book a day until I get through the 10^(th) book and then reassess. If it is not super smooth and I feel I am still getting something out of it, I might continue. However, there are some other series I am considering:  
  
Isadora Moon – they seem around the level of Magic Tree House, but I think similarly leveled books from a different author could be a nice way to broaden my base. Plus the concept seems fun.

¿Quién fue? - Biographical books for kids that seem like a nice balance for the fictional options above.

Sobreviví – Only around half a dozen of these books about historic disasters have been translated to Spanish, but they are a bit different than the other series, and seem like they could be interesting.

After whatever mix of those I either finish or get tired of, I plan to read:  
  
The Diario of Greg series

A Series of Unfortunate Events

random Roald Dahl books I bought on kindle ages ago and I am sure are too high level for now.  
  
Then onto the next thing. I think reading will help me a lot at this point, and the joys of reading “real” Spanish rather than graded readers, since I used to be a big-time reader in English, will be very rewarding for me. I plan to stick to the more basic series until they are too boring to tolerate. I trust this will make the transition upward that much easier. I went slow and steady with listening and it has really paid off (I had that post about skipping ahead in DS when suddenly my comprehension took a huge leap forward around 400 hours), and I hope it will with reading as well. Though, in the same way you can’t watch Beginner level videos for 1500 hours, I am sure at some point on the road to 1 million and then 3 million words read, I need to kick it up quite a bit. I have no doubt I will be back for guidance from the crew.

**Uncertainty But Likely Changing How To Use my Time Going Forward**:  
When it was just about listening, it was easy. Fit in more whenever I could. It took me \~2.5 months to go from Level 2 to 3, \~3.5 from Level 3 to 4, and \~5.5 months from 4 to 5. Now I sort of feel like a weight lifting. I am not sure why, but getting to Level 5 felt so key to me. The rest just seems inevitable.  
  
For 2026, I think my main goal is going to be reading. I could hit level 7 by the end of the year with 2.5 hours of listening a day, but not sure I want to make that commitment. It was a grind to get to 5! So I may just call my goal to hit Level 6 and to read a million words. I had some days hitting 3 and 4 hours over the past months and have averaged almost 2.5 hours for a while now. I want to downshift because I feel l like burnout is all that could really derail me a this point.  
  
Once the 1^(st) rolls around, I am going to aim for an hour of CI a day, kick up my reading, and continue speaking whenever I can. Maybe I will check in come April and see how the first quarter of the year felt. If I accept I will always be using subtitles for foreign TV and movies, then 1,000 hours of tracking CI could be graduation for me. Vamos a ver.",8,1766719511.0,dreamingspanish,1,1.0,False

Customers are using Google Maps, voice search, and mobile searches more than ever. That’s where **local SEO** steps in — and it can seriously change the game for your business.

Local SEO helps make sure your business shows up when people nearby are searching for what you offer. Whether it’s “best coffee shop near me” or “emergency plumber in Palm Beach Gardens,” a strong local SEO strategy puts your name in front of those ready-to-buy customers. And it’s not just about online visibility — it actually drives more phone calls and walk-in traffic directly to your door.

Here’s why it works:  
🔹 **Google prioritizes local results.** If someone searches for a product or service, they’re going to see local businesses first — especially those with optimized listings and strong local signals.  
🔹 **Online reviews and listings drive trust.** A complete Google Business Profile with accurate info, photos, and reviews builds confidence. That makes people more likely to pick up the phone or visit.  
🔹 **Mobile search is king.** Most people search on their phones, often when they’re already out. A strong local SEO presence helps you appear right when they need you.

Businesses in Palm Beach Gardens are seeing real results from this. From restaurants and salons to HVAC and real estate services, local visibility is boosting foot traffic like never before.

The power of **local SEO services Palm Beach Gardens** lies in how tailored the strategy can be. It's not just about stuffing keywords or chasing links — it’s about creating local relevance. That includes optimizing your Google Business Profile, managing local citations, using geo-targeted content, and earning local backlinks. All of these factors help you get found by the people already looking for what you offer.

And the best part? It’s a long-term investment. Unlike paid ads that stop once your budget runs out, local SEO builds over time and keeps delivering results.

If you want more calls, more walk-ins, and more real local customers, focusing on local SEO is hands-down one of the smartest moves you can make.",1,1766718931.0,InfiniteContent,0,1.0,False

1pvtywg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1pvtywg/the_real_reason_youre_emotionally_drifting_apart/,The real reason you're emotionally drifting apart (and how to fix it fast),"Lately, it feels like so many people are “fine” on the surface but secretly feeling weirdly empty in their relationships. Romantically. Socially. Even at work.

Like you’re there… but not *really* there.

You go through the motions, but the spark is gone. It’s not burnout. It’s something softer, harder to name. More people than ever are quietly drifting from people they once felt close to, and it’s happening way more than we think.

After doing deep dives into this (books, podcasts, psych research), the cause became clear. No, it’s not your attachment style or communication habits (though those can matter later).

**The #1 sign you’re emotionally drifting is this:**  
**You’ve stopped sharing small emotional data with each other.**

Seems simple, but it’s a research-backed warning signal. And the good news? There are *fast, science-based ways to reverse it*. Not fluffy IG “communication tips” or shallow TikToks. These come from serious relationship researchers, clinical psychologists, and behavioral scientists.

Let’s get into the actual fixes.

---

## 1. Share Micro-Emotions, Not Just Major Updates

In *The Love Prescription*, Drs. John and Julie Gottman highlight something called **“bids for connection.”** These are tiny, everyday moments when you reach out emotionally, like complaining about your commute or celebrating a small win.

Emotional drift happens when these moments go unnoticed or ignored.

If your partner or friend says,  
> “Ugh, today was rough,”  

and you just nod or scroll past, that’s a missed bid. The more bids we miss, the less connected we feel.

**Fix:**  
Look for and *respond* to even the “boring” emotions.  
Say things like:
- “Tell me more.”
- “Ugh, that sucks. What happened?”

It’s the quickest shortcut back to closeness.

---

## 2. Start Ritualized Check-Ins, Not Deep Talks

One of the best low-pressure connection hacks shared by Dr. Alexandra Solomon on the *Reimagining Love* podcast is **ritualized check-ins**.

Not dramatic “we need to talk” conversations. Just consistent, small moments.

Examples:
- A 10-minute, no-phone coffee debrief every Sunday.
- A daily question like:  
  *“What’s one good thing or one hard thing that happened today?”*

These rituals rebuild emotional safety.

A 2021 study published in *The Journal of Social and Personal Relationships* found that **shared routines were one of the strongest predictors of long-term relationship satisfaction**, even more than compatibility.

---

## 3. Rebuild Through Shared Novelty, Not Forced Intimacy

When connections dull, many people try to fix it by “talking it out.” But if the emotional foundation is shaky, that can backfire.

Behavioral scientist Arthur Aron’s classic research found that couples who did **novel activities together** reported higher relationship satisfaction than those who just talked more.

Our brains bond through *newness*.

**Try:**
- Taking a class together
- Cooking a weird meal
- Going on a 30-minute, no-phones-allowed walk

It works faster than awkward heart-to-hearts.

---

## 4. It’s Not Always About Love. It’s About Maintenance.

Esther Perel puts it simply:

> “Love is not a permanent state of enthusiasm. It’s a verb.”

Emotional drifting often tricks us into thinking we’re “falling out of love” or “losing interest.”

You’re probably not.

You’re just not tending to the thread that keeps people intertwined:  
**shared emotional presence.**

It’s like dental floss. You don’t notice its power until you’re dealing with the damage of *not* doing it.

---

## Final Thought

This emotional disconnect isn’t your fault.

Our culture obsesses over big talks and dramatic breakthroughs, but ignores the tiny dailies that actually hold bonds together.

You don’t need hours of therapy or a perfect relationship dynamic to reconnect.

Just start with **one micro-response today**.

I was a part of a bigger friend group that included a few girls think 6 girls then I was number 7. Yes it was ass because I ended up walking alone at graduation whilst everyone else was in pairs but it’s fine, live laugh love. 

Background on that friend group I don’t talk to any of them besides two girls Sara and my other best friend Suzan. I had a falling out with one with other girls almost two years ago and I was never that close with the rest so yeah (leaving this one friend was not easy because I stayed days not being able to sleep and overthinking so much) and I also did question if maybe I hadn’t done enough but I had given up on that friendship entirely. 

Moving onto Sara we really only started to get close after we graduated high school, and now at 21 we barely see each other because of life and shit which is normal and I am usually okay with just keeping up with people via social media because I get busy with uni and seeing people frequently unless at my campus is very hard (we go to separate universities btw) 

now I have this issue with her she is usually very late to things like late late. We will agree to meet up at 7 she will show up at 8:30 and she makes it out to be like it’s normal to be fair everyone in her family and friends are like this so I do understand that it isn’t intentional I guess, this was not an easy thing to accept as not only are my family pretty strict when it comes to what time I hang out with my friends, (curfew) because I do live at home but also as I mentioned I usually do not have time, so when I reach out asking to set up a day for us to have fun or even just dinner/ coffee then I really do care about that person. 

I brought it up to her a few months ago that yk I really don’t want her to be late to stuff and that she knows my parents and I really do not like having to wait in the car for 20 minutes outside of her door even though I had said that I had arrived 10-15 minutes prior meaning she was ok with letting me wait that long 30-45 minutes in theory (yes I would lie so she would come out “earlier” never worked btw) anyhow when talking to her about how this upset me as she said that oh yes I know that you are sensitive about time, SENSITIVE really?? No I just don’t want to make plans then have to call you to wake you up like wtf.

 My current issue, I had made plans with her a few weeks ago to meet up as we hadn’t seen each other in months (I had some news to tell her that I’m taking a semester abroad and won’t be home for 6 months). Other plans came up for me and since our hangout was meant to be a very light thing where I would pick her up after her exam and we would just eat and chat I was going to postpone it and wanted to call her to let her know, I didn’t get a response called her a few hours later, no response, called her the next day, same thing (I think one or two of those times her phone was off) mind you we were meant to meet up the next day so wtf she never called me back, she would send streaks and stuff and yes it is during finals for her so I do get that it’s stressful but babe you said on that day that you weren’t going to study so we could go out and mind you on the day that we were meant to hang out she never called at all, yes I was gonna postpone but she didn’t know that so wtf. 

I called her again almost a week after no response, I told my other best friend (Jane) and while telling her I was like is she trying to ignore me and I’m just not getting the hint??  And she said that she does think that’s the case. But here’s the thing, me and Sara have been good, like I used to sleep at this girls house after uni for an entire summer then go home, I once had a movie night with her family at 5 am and got burgers so how is this happening. Also based on our last call nothing seemed bad at all yk.

 I called her again for the last time a few days ago and nothing. Today I saw that she was hanging out with my other best friend Suzan (yes with the entire friend group that I no longer am in contact with unless I see them and we just say hi) I am not upset that they are hanging out because I know that they are all really close and are still friends my issue is she clearly has seen my calls, idk maybe I should have texted but no I won’t reach out now as I am meant to travel tomorrow and I don’t want to add stress but this situation is making it hard to enjoy the pre airport activities yk.

I also really did not want to be the person that just leaves town or doesn’t tell people until a day or two before they leave yk. Help can I really save this friendship and am I wrong for not feeling like it? Also wtf can I do to not feel bad and enjoy my time before I travel.

I have to say it was an extremely fulfilling and rewarding trip. Laos is a wonderful place for travelers, with friendly people, great food, a vibrant culture and plenty of things to see and do.

Something I hadn't actually noticed myself (I'm based in Chiang Mai), because my current hometown is such a relaxed/chill place, it's somewhat difficult to find holiday places where I can unwind even further. Even trips down to the Thai beaches end up feeling a bit more pressured, with moderate amounts of hustling and hard sell. Luckily, Laos is probably the most relaxed place I've been in a decade. You simply cannot help but get caught up in the unrushed, unhurried, laid back vibe.

I also feel that it's the first place in a long time where travelers actually have a proper chat with each other, whether at the top of a mountain trek, or chilling over sunset drinks. It doesn't feel awkward or unwarranted to reach out to strangers and say hi, or have a good chinwag over coffee or beers. The local atmosphere rubs off on foreign visitors as well. 

A few other things I have loved include; seeing children play outside and even adults not glued to devices at all hours of the day, the ludicrously low price of Beer Laos, the food (which is very similar to Thai dishes) seems even more delicious (I think because things are cooked in slower ways, without too much supermarket style additive ingredients. 

I visited Vientiane, Luang Prabang and Nong Khiaw on this trip. Skipping Vang Vieng as I'd prefer not to undo my backpacker heyday memories of that place, which seems to have changed beyond recognition.

A couple of practicalities. The new Lao-China railway is absolutely superb; fast, well priced and incredible views in certain sections.

Vientiane gets a bad rap from most travelers, but it's fine as a quick stop off. They may have some of the best priced and high quality French Bistros in the world. Not a bad way to get into the swing of the country.

Luang Prabang is overrun with Chinese tour groups. If you see a squad of white mini vans outside any attractions you are planning to visit, do a U turn and come back an hour or two later. The Phousi Hill sunset experience is entirely ruined, but is fine at sunrise or even midday as a view. I didn't really get involved in the Alms giving stuff, but it was going on outside my hotel one morning, and it was more like a noisy circus than a serene/beautiful Buddhist ceremony. Certain sections of the Mekong are being blasted with the most appalling karaoke boats, going up and down at all hours, but especially sunset time, although this can be avoided by going further down. I have written to UNESCO about this as it is massively undoing the calm atmosphere that Luang Prabang is supposed to represent. All that aside, having some patience and a smart head should help anyone to ensure this doesn't totally spoil their experience. 

The journey to Nong Khiaw is quite testing. Although Maps will estimate 3-4 hours, the roads are presumably going down in quality (even further) constantly, so expect more like 5-6. Plus of course every minvan journey in Laos turns adds on an hour or two for picking people up, chatting outside hotels, getting random goods packed into the back of the van etc. This is when patience will be key. Bring a book to read. 

Nong Khiaw itself is gorgeous. and have some moderately demanding but very good hikes. I didn't realise before visiting but it is very straightforward to arrange camping at the top, allowing visitors to get the sunset and sunrise, plus a beautiful cloud ocean in the morning. I would advise going up around 4 and staying until around 11 the next morning to get the full spectrum of magnificent views available.",1,1766718036.0,solotravel,1,1.0,False

\- Grinder issues straight out of the box

\- water/overflow indicator (the orange bob thing) gets stuck (flooded my counter 3 times already) 

\- Grind size suggestions are all over the place (21 for an espresso - come on!! The grounds at that setting look like saw dust)

\- Hopper fits very lose (literally rattles sometimes when grinding beans) - I am using the Lavazza Espresso beans)

\- frequently not able to detect the portafilter.

Never had any of these issues with my 601 (that I returned to Costco when I bought the Pro 701 series). Will be returning this too.

Insane, I know. ). Needless to say, we’ve been worked to the bone trying to balance between taking care of customers and the cats, but that’s unrelated to what I want to ask today so I’ll get to the point.

So, I’ve decided to focus on taking care of one of the cats while the other is taken care of the other cat to make things a bit simpler, and while I’d like to say that we’re making progress, it’s hard to tell with me being a first-timer at this. I’ve done what I can from the little research I did ( giving treats, playing / taking her out on walks whenever I can, pet sessions and also giving her space as much as possible ) and she’s a lot more active, wanting to run around and explore, as well as not running off whenever I come around to give her pets or to take her on walks. Sometimes she’d even lick my fingers or rub her head against my palm. But then other times she’d claw or bite my legs. Another thing I’ve noticed is that whenever she’s out on a walk she’d meow a lot, almost as if she’s searching for something or some place, but I genuinely cannot tell. 

Apparently she’s pregnant but the owner who adopted her never gave out details regarding that matter ( in fact, the staff team got little to no information at all about the two cats, and despite me asking I never got any answers. ). Perhaps she’s close to labor and is looking for a nice place to have her kittens but that’s just a guess at this point.

So, how do I proceed? Does she not trust me enough yet and I should just keep doing what I’ve been doing? Some help would be very much appreciated here. Thank you all.

What should I do?,"TL;DR: My family didn't want me to get the scale that I actually wanted for Christmas, and I'm not satisfied with the one that I got. What should I do?

Hello everyone, and Merry Christmas to you all as well!

I'm here to vent and get everyone's opinions on what I'm about to share with you.

So basically over the past few months I was doing a ton of research into reliable coffee scales for pour overs. Many times I would find scales within the $60-$80 range that would have major issues like breaking after a few months of use (looking at you Timemore). That being said, I eventually landed on the Fellow Tally Pro, which was retailing for $150 during Black Friday. I approached some family members for this, and they essentially said that they didn't want to spend $150 on a scale. They said that I should get a cheap $20 scale instead. Now, normally I'm pretty frugal with things all things considered. However:

1) I waited all year until Christmas for this, and it was one of a handful of gifts that I asked for.

2) I only approached people who actively told me that this was within their budget range for gifts per person.

3) I love coffee. It is my grounding activity, and I make it literally every single day. I NEED something that I can rely on without worrying that I spent $60 on something that just will not last. Hence, the Fellow Tally.

Instead, every person that I approached just rolled their eyes and didn't try to see why I found this to be important. Eventually, I was able to ask someone to get me a Brewista Smart Scale 3. And while I'm grateful that I have it, it was never what I truly wanted to begin with. I'm considering returning it within the post-Christmas return window and see if I can get the Fellow Tally instead.

However, the Pro is now back to its initial $199 price tag pretty much everywhere, and I would have to shell out another $100+ to get it. Either that, or I could keep the Brewista right now, forgo the $85 that I would receive from returning it, and save up for the Fellow later. I just don't want my mom to have wasted $85 on something that I never really wanted just because someone else mistook a cheaper price tag for providing better value.

he's a horder, in bad health, drinks coffee all day, has a house, but no income so welfare checks come from his house value money of you know what i mean, ( he didnt want to settle with the house after his last parent died and his brother might as wel dont exist)  
he fucked up the equalivant of getting food stamps because he dont like the way it goes and is handled in thought/spirit/people/location/taste and ability to carry.  
complains about injuries he sustained but always fucks up his own recovery hence they never go away and they keep ramping up.

this guy is a contradiction to himself.  
the amount of times i confronted him with his logic and the amount of BS he didnt realise he was spitting, he just gets angry... so deep down... he knows. and he is keeping himself in there.  
he is enabling all his own problems. and keeping them there. he does not compromise.  
he always had a big ego, but he had heart.. he still has. whenever someone was in the room who was betterat something he was ... he left with his tail between his legs snarking.  
its been over 10 years.  
everybody is done (trying) to help him.

its nice to chill and hang with one of my best buddy's.  
but most of the time... after 30 min i ask myself... why did i come here? because its very hard to keep a conversation with this guy ( that coming from me says a lot , because we always could understand each other when others didnt. )  
now we cant, and the guy is basicly so run downits kind of sad.  
at the same time... after all this time.  
im done with it.  
i noticed i kept calling his behaviour out loud more and more.  
because each time he just retaliates by trying to deflect with something completely unrelated in hope people back up.  
that dont work on me, and again after a lot of time. i just keep stepping forward in hope to finaly reach him.

but...  
im done.  
he is hopeless.  
his brain is pudding  
you can barely hold a normal conversation if at all.  
he looks, smells, like a hobo, his house is a broken collapsing mess, maybe even a health hazzard.  
and no one is allowed to help because its to mutch for his brain.  
stubborn would be key word here.  
and contradicting himself by saying that he can do it himself and he has to do it himself.  
when confronted with cold hard truth.. ''you cant, because...ect '' he just says some random BS wise man says sentence and then changes the subject 5 times a minute like he always does.  
he asspulls everything.  
dont use his microwave because the radiation makes him sick, boils his water in a pan, because he dont kitchen trust water boilers. complains about not being able to sleep... but the man only drinks coffee.  
the man has pain in his muscles and complains about being stiff and sick all the time, maybe close your window once instead of leaving it wide open whole year? ( its -8 celcius tonight)  
dont want to collect his stuff from adres,, because his aunt ( who he dont care about at all and lived in the same street )  got murdered and now its to mutch for him to go.  
i have years of story for this guy

i am done pitying this guy, i am done trying to help, i am done trying to care.  
the man can boil in his own problems, i do not feel any guild , i just wanted this off my god damn chest because right now i just want to go to the guy's house.... and slap him so hard in hope he gets his shit together... but i know i wouldnt be the first one of his friend and fam who would have tried so i wont.

or maybe im just super salty today because most of my friends have the following multiple combinations of:  
homeless  
jobless  
drug/alcohol abuse  
downright criminals  
cant buy food  
parasite's

What can I do?,"I (29M) am in a long term relationship with my gf (29F) and have been together for 4 years, we both love and committed to each other and want to make our relationship works.
The problem is, I like saving and wants to save up for a house while my gf spends money very freely. We each have our own bank account which we use for our personal expenses and shopping, but contribute an equal amount to a common account which I manage for rent, groceries, bills and car. 
Some examples of this situation is below:
I try my best to save money wherever possible, I cook and prepare food for both of us to bring to work so we don't have to eat out. The thing is my gf still buys food out to eat. I have not bought a coffee out for a few years now but she still does it a few times a week.
I cancelled my Spotify and YouTube subscriptions to save money but my gf regularly still sign up for new subscriptions. 
I only my clothes when necessary and only on sale items from Uniqlo, whereas she buys what she likes and from more expensive brands.
When I'm home alone in the summer, I don't use the air conditioning but she will if she's at home.

For context, we are about 70% towards our saving goal but 90% of that is my saving. I also earns about 40% more than her and sometimes feel bad for her so I pay for stuff that she wants to buy. I tell her please don't buy me any gifts because I prefer us to save but she still does for my birthday. 

She says we are not poor so she is allowed to spend money, I don't want to say no because it's still her money at the end of the day. But I think at least with things like eating out and coffee she can go without. 
I have told her this multiple times but to no avail as she does not seem committed as me to our goal. What can I do to make her understand?",3,1766717338.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False
1pvtlq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pvtlq4/christmas_sucked_this_year/,Christmas sucked this year.,"My life fell apart and I moved away from the area I lived all my life.

I ended up moving in with a friend and her family because she was going through a rough time and said she could use some help. She is constantly explaining to me how she is basically paycheck to paycheck so I wasn't expecting Christmas gifts from her but honestly, I am still hurt that she didn't get any for me.

I got exactly 3 gifts this year. One from a client down here that got me a Starbucks gift card after I told her Starbucks isn't my favorite. I am not a big fancy coffee drinker. Plain coffee is just fine for me.

The other 2 were from my friend's mother. I didn't really want to come here but my friend insisted that we were family and I should come.

One of the things her mother got me is a blanket in a color I don't like. The other is what looks to be a sugar bowl or something that I suspect came from a Ross or the like. People that know me know that I drink a lot of coffee but also find out pretty quickly that I drink it black, no sugar. So why did she get me what looks like a sugar bowl?

I had to sit there pretending like I enjoyed the gifts while she brought out item after item for her daughter. I get it. It's her prerogative to spoil her actual child. I just wish I felt remembered and really cared about.

I understand a lot of this is just being in a new place around the holidays. But none of that is making me feel any better right now and I can't tell anyone in my life without feeling like I am ruining their holiday.",3,1766717309.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

1pvtizp,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1pvtizp/the_tuscan_game/,The Tuscan Game,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.

They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.

One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.

“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.

It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.

“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”

“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”

They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:

Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.

A wave of excitement washed over them.

“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”

“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”

Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:

“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”

“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.

The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it, was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.

With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.

“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”

They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.

A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.

“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”

A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.

“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.

The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”

“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”

“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”

“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”

“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.

“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”

“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”

“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.

“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”

“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”

“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.

“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.

“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”

Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”

A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.

As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”

“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom

They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.

The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.

“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”

“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”

They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.

It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.

“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”

“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.

Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.

“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.

“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”

They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.

It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.

They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.

“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”

With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.

Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.

The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.

The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.

“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.

“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.

“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”

“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”

“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.

“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”

The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.

“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”

He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.

“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.

“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.

The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.

A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.

""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.

""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""

A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,

No Service.

His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""

""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.

""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""

Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.

Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.

He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.

He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.

""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""

At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.

Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.

The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.

A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.

The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""

Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.

As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.

Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.

""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.

Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.

She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described. As a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud

Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.

She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her from grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface stirred, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.

""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment.""

There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""

He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.

Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium. The page loaded a list of stories, and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration. He opened a fresh document on his computer and began to take notes, his fingers flying across the keyboard, already building the foundations of his next masterpiece.

You should only consider me if you live in the USA, are ok with me being an atheist/liberally minded person, and I NEVER want children in my life including your own. Otherwise, just understand that I am concrete on what my stances are on those subjects.

I woke up a little earlier from some commotion downstairs; my mother up much, much earlier than she'd usually be, preparing the turkey for the oven. I had an easy morning doing all my usual things like getting and coffee and feeding the pets then once everyone was settled we opened gifts. My parents seemed to like all of what I got them this year. My father was particularly excited about the CD I got him and the fancy pairs of underwear and socks mother got him. Mother is very fond of the bra we got her, the microwave steam cover, the plant propagation hanger, the seeds, etc. Cooper went bad over his new ball which I didn't realize was a giant exercise ball. Peach got a toy that dispenses treats but if I'm being honest, she was more interested in the treats than the playing; I did most of the batting around for her while she feasted on the aftermath.

I myself got a lovely assortment of goodies. The most pleasant surprise was this engraving pen; I had never asked for one or considered having one but not that I have it, my mind is swimming with ideas. It has over 30 diamond bits and even comes with little pieces of wood, plastic, metal, and leather you can practice on. It will be wonderful for book binding. Maybe I'll make engraved paintings on plywood or even learn how to make wooden toys. We'll see. I also got quite a few lovely little things. Highlights would be a whole box of my favorite coffee, tiny jam & peanut butter that I have always loved to spread on crackers, and a box of fancy chocolate. Also, a grow bag for cucumbers with cucumber seeds, some new pants, and a new coat. Darling's gift was a beautiful pen. I made sure to email them my thanks. And like a spoiled little unemployed brat, they also gave me some money. More than I have ever been able to earn on my own. All in all, I am a very lucky old sap.

I again did nothing but try to maintain good spirits too success for the most part. I helped to cook when Mother asked me to but she is a very independent person when it comes to christmas dinner. There were a few moments of tension, entirely from mother. As mothers can do, she on many occasions, particularly during dinner, can let out a viscous cloud of displeasure than spikes my anxiety like nothing else. No one has to have done anything wrong for her to make the guilt a gas chamber. She snapped at me very rudely on a few occasions and I have been careful to keep my tongue.

Lucky us, garbage day is tomorrow so now we are busy cleaning up. Normally we would leave some things like wrapping paper and the turkey bits that no one eats for the day after christmas but we a new garbage schedule rolling out in the new year, tomorrow is the last garbage pick up for two weeks. We really can't afford to sit on out thumbs. So now, I am going to get all my extra and usual chores done before I can settle down with a coffee and my new chocolates. Maybe a cookie too if I am feeling particularly gluttonous. Goodness, am I looking forward to it.

Yours & Mine,

1pvtdn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pvtdn9/asking_a_girl_out/,Asking a girl out,"Just in needing some encouragement and advice.

So there is this cute girl at work: same team but different shift. Anyhow, when I first joined the company - I found her giving me signs: moving her hair back, taking off her hoodie (if you know you know), being overall friendly, asking questions, taking the opportunity to walk with me after work, asking me questions in slack etc. These are very obvious signs I picked up but promptly ignored them. But after some months, whether that is due to the shift - I havent received anything else from her. At the same time, she has kinda been growing on me. But by this point, I assume she lost interest.

But let me know, maybe these are not signs and just her being friendly. I do remember receiving attention from women still in school which I only realized much much later which was too late. Even at work, I have been receiving again, what I call signs from this other girl but ignored them too.

Anyway, maybe I'm just reading way too much into this and am completely wrong so I appreciate outside perspective. Another thing to note, I never had any kind of romantic relationships so I am clueless in all of this. I have only flirted once with this other girl, which to my surprise came naturally but then we split off.

Back to this girl, I was thinking of inviting her for coffee after work. I was thinking of saying something in the line of ""Hey, would you be down to get some coffee sometime after work?"" and her my phone number on a piece of paper. Does this work, or is there another maybe more casual way to invite her?

And I do know the saying Dont shit where you eat but am still looking for some thoughtful advice, or maybe this is just a bad idea alltogether?

For the past 8 years I have never received a gift that was just meant for me. All of my gifts have been more targeted towards family use like new pots and pans, coffee maker, meat thermometer, Clothes that dont fit me so they go to my mother, waffle maker and box mix sweets like brownie and cookie types i dont even like.
This year my mom asked if I wanted money instead of gifts and I said absolutely. Instead I got a new coffee maker the exact one my mom had been thinking about buying for herself for months and coffee items like that mixing thing that vibrates. No money no other gift just that. And sure im used to it i thought I would be fine but when I opened a gift from my sister and her wife it was a ceramic frog and frog themed shirts. I love frogs they are my favorite animal. I dont know why but it broke me finally getting something that's for my enjoyment and not something that was for the family or my mom it just felt so weird nice but weird. 

I know it sounds stupid or like im ungrateful for what my mother has bought me but its hard to be thankful for something you never wanted especially knowing its not really for me.

1pvtcb6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pvtcb6,"Christmas Day wines, Merry Christmas y'all!","Merry Christmas r/wine, tonight we had an amazing pot roast with carrots and some various other savory sides, so I decided to crack this bottle to enjoy with the family.

Durfort Vivens is in Margaux and is one of the wineries who have massively stepped up their game recently, but the wine in this bottle was before the time they decided to fight for their 2nd growth status with some help from Michel Rolland.

Domaine Ostertag is a Kermit Lynch producer from Alsace who makes some *killer* wines that can sometimes be a little hit and miss, but in the same way as your rental car being a Mercedes because they were all out of Ferraris

**2006 Chateau Durfort-Vivens Rouge, Margaux, Bordeaux**- Decanted for about 2 hours, the first notes to really hit me were blackberry jam, old oak staves that had been outside in the rain for a long time, blueberry and some dark cherry.

On the palate, you had blackberry, black mulberry, blueberry, dark cherry jam, leather, oak, black potting soil, and a wave of smooth tannins. Though present on the finish, they weren't overpowering/the star of the show like in other reds like Barolo. 

The lack of work from the pre-Rolland era is definitely present here, though that's not to say there are any flaws, this is a perfectly enjoyable Margaux that stays to character and ages quite gracefully. 

All in all, this was very well integrated with medium acidity, medium body, and paired very well with pot roast. A solid bottle of Bordeaux and well appreciated addition to dinner.

An enjoyable well made Bordeaux at an enjoyable age at an enjoyable price; yet another bottle that proves you don't need the best of the best to have a good glass of wine. 



**2018 Domaine Ostertag Fronholz Gewurztraminer Vendanges Tardives, Alsace, France**- For dessert, a wine I had totally forgotten about in a walkin cooler about 3 months ago. I expected it to be showing some signs of being flawed but NOPE, still incredibly alive and well.

On the nose, this shows off the beauty of Gewurztraminer. Elegant white flowers, acacia honey, lychee, Bosch and asian pear, and nectarine zest with delicate hints of cinnamon and fresh ground cardamom like for Turkish coffee. 

On the palate you first get hit with a wall of candied fruits, most notably apricot, but overripe peach, poached pear, and even this hint of cinnamon hit you like a truck. The acidity seems to have gone down since I first had it several months ago which, yeah, fair play to the wine; you were in the grocery walkin for most of the fall. 

The sweetness hits you and that's when you first notice the honey. Holding back from the initial blast of flavors, the honey waits until after the fruits to step out because it evolves through the mid-palette into the full honey flavor compete with acacia flowers that are so incredibly perfumey.

Singing on their own, the flowery and honey notes pick up an incredibly strong undertone of lychee/fruit cocktail syrup, which sticks around until the when it gradually fades into cinnamon, while the flowers and honey slowly morph together into this Chanel No. 5 air of sweet, perfumey, and just a touch bitter. 

Great bottle, but definitely not one for the person who wants a dessert level wine with very little acidity to match the brix, or who isn't interested in quite a lot of delicious fruit and white flower perfumes.

This from the man who had a double VCR hooked up to each of three TVs we had at home in 1982. I remember renting The Empire Strikes Back from Radio Shack in 1984 as soon as it came out. This was before video stores were on every corner and we needed to leave a $100 deposit as collateral so the movie would be returned. We were able to record the movie, and many, many others, on our double VCR. 

He also had the stereo system in our dining room wired throughout the entire house so each room had its own speaker that could be individually turned on, room by room. We had two phone lines; one number for our parents and another number for the kids. We could merge three way calls in middle school. 

We had a computer at home before we had them at school. We had a van with a TV/VCR plugged into the cigarette lighter in 1990.  In 1993 for Christmas he bought me a portable, fold up Brother Word Processor that looked and worked like a laptop. I was doing my college homework in coffee shops  ten years before the business world was. 

Not only did he have his own “video camera on dad’s shoulder” style camera since the early 80s; he also bought me a small vhsc hand held recorder for high school graduation in 94. This man, and all of us, had every new gadget. 

“I think your grandchildren get this from you,” I said as I reminded him of all these things.  I think I made his Christmas. ",175,1766716462.0,GenX,20,0.97,False

I’d like your input on two instances of where I did very different designs and sizes…for the same price:

Client 1: Commissioned me to letter a 2’x3’ vertical chalkboard for a farmers market. Included a 3-word title + 3-word subtitle + specific foliage/plants illustrations. Three colors. I bought the markers. 

Client 2: Coffee shop owner commissioned me to design a 4’x3’ horizontal menu board that will be up through February. Winter themed (stars, snowflakes, candles), featuring 3 themed latte specials + 2 new foods, al with detailed descriptions. Unlimited colors. They supplied the markers. 

I want to be more consistent in my pricing. Which one, in your opinion and experience, was worth the $160? Thank you! ",2,1766716448.0,artbusiness,1,1.0,False
1pvtaj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightshift/comments/1pvtaj0/take_care_of_yourselves_tonight_for_real_and/,"Take care of yourselves tonight, for real. And start something new tomorrow.","Last night was the holiday for me since my work is goofy the way their schedules work on night shift, but work tonight as my normal “Friday.”

Been working in rail for over a decade now and the amount of injuries and accidents I’ve seen happen during the holidays is pretty crazy. Stay focused while you’re at work, whether it’s slow or not and whether you have people at home who depend on you or if you’re single.

Tagging on with the whole taking care of yourselves thing: I know it’s pretty much meta at this point for you fellow night shifters to be downing energy drinks and eating gas station food every night because it’s convenient or cool or whatever else you wanna tell yourself… you guys gotta cut that shit out. 

Start taking better care of yourself and don’t wait. Just start tomorrow. Switch to tea or coffee. Cook up some food at home, doesn’t have to be anything crazy there are tons of simple recipes out there, just be an adult. 

This is coming from a 36yo dude who has either lost of a lot of friends in the last 5 years from total negligence in their health thinking they’re invincible, or seen my own health decline based on diet and routines based off night shift lifestyle. This shouldn’t be happening, not for decades, but you’re expediting these problems based on your own choices. 

Happy Holidays ya’ll, I’ll cheers you in the morning 🍻 

TL/DR: Be safe, happy holidays, stop eating like you’re 13. ",5,1766716335.0,Nightshift,0,0.86,False

Highlights:
Mummified hand and bird faced urn before the end of act 1.
Coffee dripper was nice because I full healed pretty much every fight with the urn anyway.
Enchiridion and frozen egg early act 2.
