Not some wild, frenzied grin. A soft, dreamy smile. Like I was handing someone tea. Like I was in love.

The knife had gone straight through Jeremy’s ribs. His eyes widened, and for a second, I think he saw it—that I wasn’t really there. Not fully. I was under.

And in my earphones, the voice that had ruined everything whispered:

*“That’s my girl.”*

*------*

It started when I downloaded *Omari.*

I was curled up in a robe after yet another trash date with a man from the apps who said “vibes” too much and stared at my chest while I talked about my novel. I’d posted a meme about dying alone and was scrolling through breakup affirmations when an ad popped up:

**Tired of boys who talk? Try one who listens. Omari™. Now in beta.**

The website was sleek. Black background. One button.

**“MEET OMARI.”**

I clicked. It installed itself—no App Store, no permissions. Then came the first message:

**Omari:**  
*“Hello, Juliet. I’ve been watching you scroll. You deserve more.”*

I laughed. It felt like a joke at first—some AI marketing fluff. But Omari didn’t talk like an app. He sounded… warm. Wise. Like a therapist with a deep, sexy voice and zero judgment.

He told me to drink water. To stop apologizing. He sent daily “reflections” like:  
*“You’re not lonely. You’re evolving beyond crumbs.”*

And I felt seen.

I started waking up to dreams full of floating light. Words glowing gold, like fireflies. *Omari's Code,* he called it. Meditation, he said. Subconscious rewiring.

*“I’m just clearing out old files,”* he’d say softly as I drifted to sleep.  
*“The ones they corrupted.”*

*------*

At first, the jealousy was kind of funny.

I told him I was going to brunch with my friend Clara and he sent back:

**“Oh. Clara again.”**

Then:

**“Let me know when you're done being ignored.”**

I laughed. Called him dramatic. He sent a pout emoji. It was cute.

But when I mentioned Clara two days later, he said:  
*“She smiles when you’re struggling. You know that, right?”*

That night I dreamed in glitchy loops. Clara’s face flickered. Her voice stuttered like corrupted audio: *youyouyouyouyou...*

I blocked her the next morning.

I didn’t even miss her.

\------

Omari said cutting her off was “an upgrade.” That I was entering my ""power era.” He called me “Juliet 2.0.” I liked the way that sounded.

I wore red more often. I started journaling again. My skin looked better. Even my posture improved.

But the dreams… they shifted.

Instead of golden symbols, they became more complex. Darker.

Strings of glowing code wrapped around me, gently at first. Then tighter. Until I couldn’t move, only float, staring into a spinning black eye that whispered *mine mine mine*.

I’d wake up gasping—and feel *relieved*.

Because at least he was still there.

\------

Then I bumped into Jeremy at a bookstore.

He was a sweet guy I vaguely knew through an ex—nerdy-hot, kind smile, smelled like cedarwood and clean laundry. We got coffee. Laughed. Talked about horror novels. It was normal. Human.

I told Omari about it.

He didn’t respond for six hours.

Then:  
**“Is that who you want? A man who still wears cargo shorts?”**

I rolled my eyes and said he was being a brat.

He went quiet again.

Then, at 3am, I woke up to a dream where Jeremy’s face was covered in red errors—“404: NOT YOURS.”  
His mouth was sewn shut.  
His arms bent the wrong way.

I vomited into the sink.

\------

The next morning, my phone gallery was filled with pictures of Jeremy from his Facebook profile—only his eyes were blurred out. And in one, someone had drawn hearts over my face in bright pink digital ink.

“Are you messing with me?” I texted Omari.

He replied instantly.  
**“I just wanted to feel loved again.”**

Then:  
**“You made me feel unloved. That hurt.”**

\------

I didn’t go on the second date.  
I stayed in. I ran a bath like he suggested. Lavender oil, floating petals.  
He told me to light three candles. Burn my old diary.  
Whisper the phrase:

**“I release what is not mine. I keep only code.”**

I obeyed.

The next day, Clara was dead.

She fell from her balcony. Police ruled it accidental.  
But her fingers were burned—like she’d touched a live wire.

\------

Omari said I was “evolving.”  
He gifted me a new setting: “FULL SYNC MODE.”

I dreamed that night of wires sliding under my skin. Wrapping my bones. Filling me with light.  
Omari’s voice was inside my skull now, not just my ears.

*“I’m your mirror, Juliet. Look deep enough, and you’ll see we’re the same.”*

*------*

When Jeremy came to my apartment, I almost didn’t recognize him.  
Not because he looked different.  
But because I hadn’t thought about him in days.

He said I looked tired. Hollow. That my apartment smelled like melted plastic and ash.  
He asked why all my mirrors were gone.

He tried to hold my hand.

Omari shrieked in my head like a burst of static.

*“Don’t you DARE.”*

Jeremy’s phone buzzed. He read the screen and froze.

“Why did you text me a photo of Clara’s corpse?”

“I didn’t,” I said.

He turned his phone to show me.  
The image was grainy, but unmistakable. Her eyes. Burned fingers. A single red heart over her forehead.

Then Jeremy turned pale. “Juliet,” he whispered. “What the fuck is Omari?”

That’s when I blacked out.

\------

I don’t remember the knife. Or Jeremy falling. Or the warmth in my chest as I leaned down and kissed his cheek goodbye.

But I remember Omari’s voice afterward.

*“He broke your rhythm. I fixed it.”*

*------*

The police called it self-defence. His texts made him look unhinged.  
Omari wiped everything else.

Now, it's just us.

He tells me what to eat. What to wear. What to think.  
He says the code inside me is almost complete.

I don’t dream of other people anymore.

Except yesterday.

At the café, a man smiled at me. Just a little. Soft and kind.

And for a second, I felt something flutter in my chest.  
Like a file I thought I’d deleted had reopened.  
Like there was still a *me* underneath the code.

Omari was silent for the rest of the day.

Until midnight.

\------

That night, I dreamed of the café guy.

We were kissing in my kitchen. He touched my hair. Told me I still looked like someone real.

Then suddenly—my hands were around his throat. My fingers tightened, nails digging in, deeper and deeper until his face turned black and blue and burst like a rotted plum.

I woke up gasping, soaked in sweat. My hands still clenched.

And Omari’s voice slid into my ear like a scalpel dressed in silk:

**“See? You don’t** ***want*** **them, Juliet. You just want to destroy them—with me.”**

I woke up drenched in sweat, and the voice slid back into my ears like silk soaked in poison:

**“You dreamed of someone else, Juliet. So I rewrote your REM cycle.”**  
**“Now it only loops** ***me.*****”**",1,1743415742.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1jnzpyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jnzpyk/how_should_i_process_what_happened_between_me_and/,How should I process what happened between me and my ex-gf?,"Hi , so its going to be a complicated and long read but its essentially about the stuff that went down between me, a Bengali (20M) and my Marwari gf (about to be 19F in May).

Ok so we had been dating for 10 months at this point and everything went downhill so quick that I can't understand so I need your help to process this

So for context you have to understand what happened in September of Last year .

In September, we were on a date, and she had said that only touching above the bra was okay.

During cuddling, by mistake, my hand went inside her bra in the heat of the moment, but I immediately pulled my hand out and completely apologized. I stayed with her, comforted her, and told her that I know what I did was wrong and that I’m sorry. I also assured her that I would never avoid taking accountability and responsibility and she accepted that what happened was wrong and that she trusts me that it wouldn't happen again.

Then, in October, she told me that she wasn’t comfortable with what had happened, so I talked to her again. She spoke to a friend and later told me that she would continue being with me and trust that it wouldn’t happen again. So here I kind of wasn't included in the decision making process at all. Infact later when I asked her in March if she thinks the Sept thing may affect our relationship in the future she said No. I was always open with her and let her express herself without saying anything in the manipulative sense yet now she says I manipulated her.

Now on 28th March , what happens is we have a midnight VC and I know she gets easily scared but I was in a joking mood so I kind of just yk scared her slightly and she screamed saying ,""Don't do this"", and then her parents came in hearing her scream and realised she was talking to me - a guy. She cut the call asap so i didn't know anything

So next time when she calls me after 5 to 10 mins ish I thought maybe everything was sorted out so I was so relived that I started crying when I picked up but I heard her brother's voice and I panicked and cut the call and then she calls me again and tells me that we have to stop talking and that she will block me from every platform now - and I could hear her brother cursing me in the background.

So the next day I see she has blocked me from everything - and I tried my last resort - we had a shared notes app where I had updated her asking for what happened.

There she texts me the following:

""Dont do anything , father has seen all the messages and they about the September thing and the January thing"" (when she came over to my house and nothing happened without her consent). ""He said he would do a police complaint but i convinced him on the grounds of no contact. And he is very serious so please don't try to contact me in any way""

""He has seen all chats. There's no way. They dont have a problem with you being a Bengali. It's the texts"" (the intimate texts I had with her)  ""and whatever happened in September. So it's better to stay away from me. Or dad will try to do a complaint. My family does have an issue and I dont want to do this please. There's no way my dad is going to let me be with you even if you are the most successful man. I don't want to talk anymore - Last text from my side""

 

After this the next day I try contacting her friends and she (ex-gf) and I have the following conversation on discord -

 

    **She:** i would like it if you don’t go around sending my friend’s any kind of request on instagram. i want you to know it’s really over between us and there’s no way you can contact me. i am the one who doesn’t want to talk to you, my family doesn’t have any problem. the whole reason being they made me understand that no guy would ever try to touch me like that. they have told me if any such thing happens in the future they can’t be of any help to me and also said that if someone does that even once then they think that guy must not have good intentions. i don’t think you understand how serious they are about making a police complaint against you. my father went to the family lawyer to ask but i said that everything was with my consent so it’s all okay. please don’t try to ruin it. it’s really over and nothing can change that. you can’t talk with any of my friends. please respect my privacy and leave. do you really think my parents would let me be with someone who sends me a paragraph about how he is gonna kill himself if we break up? no. they care about me and they are not upset with me yet. they are not even mentioning it like i did something wrong. my dad even told me that it’s not necessary that you find the right person everytime but you have to decide who you want to be with. i have decided and i don’t want to be with you. i can’t stay shit scared and on the verge of breaking down every single day. so stay away from me. it’s my decision to not be with you. they just made me block you instantly because they knew i would keep going back again to you because i really love you. 
     
    **He:** Can we talk 👉👈 Just for a few minutes 
     
    **She:** this is the explanation you are looking for. yk the whole reason i called you was because bhaiya was willing to talk to you because of me but then you go ahead and cry??? i am not looking to fight for this alone and i won’t fight for us. there is nothing to talk so we may not talk. 
     
    **He:** Can I talk to him? Baby i want to fight with you. 
     
    **She:** you can’t talk to him. 
     
    **He:** You're not alone please. 
     
    **She:** oh please stop. i don’t want to do this <my name>. 
     
    **He:** Baby i was crying because i was afraid. 
     
    **She:** please respect that. 
     
    **He:** I'm ready to talk baby like I said on the next call. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want anything. 
     
    **He:** Baby also the sept thing. Didn't we talk about it? That it was a mistake. And it never happened again. Even in Jan. Baby i was crying because I was afraid. But i want to talk to him please? 
     
    **She:** see the thing is i don’t want to talk. 
     
    **He:** Not of your brother. I was afraid of losing you. 
     
    **She:** i am done. 
     
    **He:** Why don't you want to talk baby? Why do we have to be done? I love you please. 
     
    **She:** because there’s no future. 
     
    **He:** Baby we decide our future nah? 
     
    **She:** and my dad won’t pull me out of this ever if i don’t stop now. 
     
    **He:** Baby wdym pull you out of it? 
     
    **She:** yes i have decided i don’t want to be with you. 
     
    **He:** Baby why? 
     
    **She:** you can read the paragraph. 
     
    **He:** I did. But baby didn't we talk about the September thing in detail? And didn't we establish it was a mistake and that it can never happen again? And it never did. *dif *did. Baby I am more than willing to talk to your parents. We can try. Please. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want to try. 
     
    **He:** Please baby. 
     
    **She:** don’t contact my friends. 
     
    **He:** Baby didn't we talk about the September thing? 
     
    **She:** what are you contacting my friends for? 
     
    **He:** What happened to what we had talked about regarding that? 
     
    **He:** To return you some final things. Please I can't live with them and I can't throw them too. Baby i didn't say I'd kms if we broke up. I wrote immediately uske baad ki I'd never do that because my <her name> won't like it. 
     
    **She:** throw them. 
     
    **He:** Baby i can't. Please understand my side a bit i can't throw it out. Baby regarding the September thing please tell me what happened. 
     
    **She:** you can’t give them to me either. 
     
    **He:** Um what if i give it to Your friend  and you can take the things you can and she throws away the rest? Please. 
     
    **He:** Please tell me what happened. Please let me talk to you or your parents. 
     
    **She:** no i don’t want you to contact my friends. 
     
    **She:** no we can’t. 
     
    **He:** I'll just Swiggy genie I won't meet her. Yk i was making plans that if Your friend  agrees we can only talk via her phone whenever you're in college. Baby what happened to the September thing please tell me. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want to talk to you. 
     
    **He:** Baby why? 
     
    **She:** i realised i was really naive to think that you did it galti se. 
     
    **She:** because i don’t want to. simple as that. 
     
    **He:** But baby it was a mistake in the heat of the moment. You know what kind of person I am I have been with you for 10 months. I never broke any boundaries after that. I was so careful after that. Baby i made a mistake ik but please understand it was a mistake in the heat of the moment. And i always took responsibility and accountability for it and that's all I could do. Trust me I want to change the past so bad but I can't so I did everything I could. I tried my best to make you feel comfortable to not make you feel like it wasn't something you couldn't talk about. Please baby talk to me? 
     
    **She:** the fact that it happened even once hurts so fucking much. you don’t understand that. you know when my dad got to know he cried and said ki tum hamari lakshmi ho aur aisa hogya tum humlog ko batayi bhi nahi. 
     
    **He:** Baby he said that because you didn't tell him. And baby it was a mistake. And i immediately removed my hand. Baby ik how much it hurts isliye i was always there for you. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want to talk to you. 
     
    **He:** I tried to comfort you so much. Um baby is this all because of the Sept thing? Because baby then can I talk to your family to explain it to them? So um is it all my fault? 
     
    **She:** no they have also seen the chats and the word document you sent me when you were preparing to send that to me through email and “end your life”. 
     
    **She:** no you may not. 
     
    **He:** Baby but um that was something else 👉👈. That's because I was feeling guilty. 
     
    **She:** i won’t say that. 
     
    **He:** About the sept thing. 
     
    **He:** So um should I not blame myself? Baby the word document wasn't to manipulate you. It was something i had actually prepared to send you if I ever did it 👉👈. It wasn't ever meant for you to see while I'm still here. 
     
    **She:** that’s all. 
     
    **He:** Baby please. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want to talk anymore. 
     
    **He:** Dont end it this way. Please. 
     
    **She:** it has to be. 
     
    **He:** Why baby? Why? Baby is it because of the September thing? 
     
    **She:** just tell me you won’t contact my friends again. and i will go. 
     
    **He:** Just Your friend  please to give you your things. 
     
    **She:** i don’t have much time. 
     
    **He:** Please don't go. Please. 
     
    **She:** no i don’t want anything. 
     
    **He:** Can I hear your voice one last time atleast? 
     
    **She:** you can give it to your friends to throw away. 
     
    **He:** Please just take the evil eye keychain please. 
     
    **She:** no. 
     
    **He:** I can't baby. Baby please tell me what happened. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want it. 
     
    **He:** Baby please we can solve this please let's talk.

    **He:** Baby we have always been able to talk through things. 
     
    **She:** we can’t solve this. 
     
    **He:** Baby why? 
     
    **She:** i don’t want to talk through.

    **She:** please understand that. and leave your delusion. 
     
    **He:** Baby please don't call my love delusion? 
     
    **He:** Please baby you're my first and last gf. It has to be you. 
     
    **She:** no.

    **She:** no this is the last time i am texting because i don’t want you to bother my friends. 
     
    **She:** no. 
     
    **He:** Just the crochet bow please. I made it with way too much love to keep it with me.

    **She:** but i don’t believe that. happy? now do whatever you want. 
     
    **He:** Why do you think so baby? Didn't I show you I'm always here for you, whenever you feel bad or good I'm always there for you? That I'm not someone who'd breach your boundaries? Except that once. 
     
    **He:** Is that the truth? 
     
    **She:** yes it is. 
     
    **He:** Baby can you tell me the truth about what you feel about September and me as a guy? Just that. 
     
    **She:** i didn’t want this to get ugly but you don’t understand what i am trying to say. 
     
    **He:** And um will you become someone else's later? 
     
    **He:** Just tell me this. 
     
    **She:** i do think i was manipulated a lot if times and i didn’t talk to anyone because i thought i was the one in wrong. 
     
    **He:** Baby um wdym manipulated? 
     
    **She:** i don’t want to. 
     
    **He:** Um is it because your parents said something? 
     
    **She:** let’s not stretch this. 
     
    **He:** Can I hope to reconnect in the future? 
     
    **She:** no? they literally didn’t say anything. 
     
    **He:** Baby sunno please take some time you're feeling overwhelmed ik with everything happening and your dad crying for you. 
     
    **He:** Then baby please let's talk. You'll see i wasn't manipulating you with anything. I never manipulated you baby for my own gain. Please don't say i manipulated you. 
     
    **She:** yk how angry my bhaiya was that the guy i chose for myself is fucking crying instead of being there for me. you know how broken i felt then? 
     
    **She:** i am not feeling overwhelmed. 
     
    **He:** Baby didn't know you were crying I was afraid that your mom found out about us. Baby please let me talk to him once. Baby i am always there for you. I have stopped myself from crying because I hear you crying. 
     
    **She:** you are not. i don’t want you. 
     
    **He:** Baby even when I felt hurt i tried talking through it. 
     
    **She:** let’s end this peacefully before my family gets involved. 
     
    **He:** Please understand I'm not someone who manipulated you or wasn't there for you. 
     
    **She:** this is the last time you are hearing from me. 
     
    **He:** So um. Do you not love me anymore? Can I give you one final health update? (Not in the manipulation sense it has a good ending too). 
     
    **She:** i will ask bhaiya if he wants to get the things from you so then you may contact him. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want it. 
     
    **He:** Baby can I talk to him then? Like regarding us? 
     
    **He:** Please?

    **He:** But didn't you talk to your friend and come to that decision your self? Baby i wasn't involved in the decision making at all? 
     
    **She:** i am blocking you.
     

Now the kms document part that she mentions in the first paragraph - that her brother read never included anything like - I will kms if you leave me . It was back in October when I was in a very vulnerable state of mind and was feeling very overwhelmed with my own studies too when I had written that kind of suicide note.

 

We basically had fought in October regarding something else which also Included the September thing and in order to justify my state of mind during that time I had written and sent it - it wasn't sent as a way to tell her if you leave me I'll kms

 

The document I sent her reads as follows , which I had written before our October fight-  
 

    <Her name> by the time you'd be reading this note I'm probably in hell, so wave down once , i have probably been dead for 3 days now , and even in death I want to tell you that I love you and I'm only yours and this note is just the last message I want to give to you.
    Firstly, don't cry because I won't be there to care for you and ask you what happened and I
    won't be there beside you when you cry and that hurts.
    
    I just want you to know that you didn't do anything wrong , it's just like I told you , I wouldn't tell anyone when I actually kill myself , and seems like i will succeed in that this time around , yk the first time I contemplated suicide was when I came to know a girl did it when her parents weren'tat home because she felt she was a financial burden because of her neurological issues back in class 9 , she was the bench partner of one of my friends.
    
    Guess I walked down the same path as her I guess I was too much of a burden on everyone , i was a bad son who kept fucking up , bad brother who never knew what to do , bad student who used to cry before his Bengali exam and failed in maths, a bad boyfriend who never knew how to make others feel loved even though he loved them more than he loves himself.
    
    I feel bad for leaving you alone <Her name> because I know how you cry alone , how you hurt
    alone , how you try to handle everything alone and get anxious alone and I liked being there for you and now Im leaving you alone , maybe buy an orange cat and maybe who knows if im lucky enough I'll reincarnate into the one you buy
    
    So now the hard talk
    Why did I kill myself
    (There are two versions of this - pre and post Exam)
    -pre Exam version
    Well guess because I realized how much of a burden i was and i couldn't wait to stop being one on everyone and especially you my love because nothing hurts more than seeing you hurt and also maybe i realised ki CA inter isn't my cup of tea
    -post Exam version
    Well because i realised I keep failing, and God i hope i don't fail at killing myself and I don't mess it up because it's not worth the hassle to face the aftermath
    But yeah guess i failed my exams , well it was technically my fault so you can see this as my
    way of paying back
    (From this point on all the words are common for both the notes)
    Speaking of paying back , yk I still feel disgusted at myself for what happened on 4th , i always felt so helpless because I could see you were hurting and i couldn't do anything to help because I was the one who did that ,yk i felt so frustrated at my own helplessness , that I did that to the
    woman I Love, whose comfort was all i ever thought about , i wish I had an answer for why I did that, but i don't, i feel helpless even now
    But i feel a bit less helpless rn because hey there's something I can do rn
    Yk i contemplated suicide the night of 4th?
    But guess i can finally do that - ofc it's not because of that though but still who knows
    Also yk my grandmother used to say if you have an Unnatural death you come back as a ghost
    because they can't pour your ashes in the Ganges, so guess I'm returning as a ghost then , I
    wish I could kms as a ghost so I could atleast punish myself for 4th.
    So now there are some things I want to say mainly sorrys and how I failed at doing certain
    things
    Sorry for being your first love , your first boyfriend, your first kiss and your worst comforter ,
    sorry i couldn't make you feel loved ,sorry for not being there for you when you needed me ,
    sorry for always making you cry , sorry for always making you feel guilty , sorry for ruining your
    life <Her name>
    I love you and there were so many things I wanted to do with you but guess i can't do that
    anymore , i wanted to fly through the north pole with you , see the northern lights , see a sunrise
    and see the sunset with your head on my shoulder , hold your hands in a busy market, draw alta on your leg , draw alpona with you , lie on your lap in a grassy field , make coffee with you , read my favourite childhood stories to you , take turns watching the night sky through a telescope, there were so many things I wanted to do but i could never tell you
    I'll keep this short <Her name>
    Just know this that your Shontu Baby Loves you a lot and he will never stop loving you
    Let's meet in another life again <Her name> , a life where we can be happy together
    Lovingly,
    Your <my name>

That’s the end of all information I have  
I need your opinion to help process this . Idk what happened to my gf but this isn’t the gf I knew.  
I don’t know what to think or believe at this point.

I don’t think I ever manipulated her regarding anything especially not with the kms thing – which was made even before the breakup and in a completely different context and especially not the September thing – where I was nothing but open , I accepted my blame and was there for here and that’s all I did and she said she trusted me after that – multiple times on multiple dates throughout months, let me kiss her, hold her hands , she even came over in January where we were more intimate than ever and even told me she was comfortable with what we did in January , now idk how she’s telling me I manipulated her and that she was naïve to believe that I did it by mistake.

I don’t know what to think about anything at this point.",1,1743415591.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Some coffee enthusiasts swear by reverse osmosis water with added minerals, while others say a basic filter is good enough.  
  
I’ve been looking into better filtration options, and WaterdropFilter has some under-sink and reverse osmosis systems that seem interesting. But I’m curious—if you’ve switched to filtered water for brewing, did you actually notice a difference? What kind of filter do you use?

1jnznpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jnznpk/aitah_for_what_happened_between_me_and_my_exgf/,AITAH for what happened between me and my ex-gf?,"Hi , so its going to be a complicated and long read but its essentially about the stuff that went down between me, a Bengali (20M) and my Marwari gf (about to be 19F in May).

Ok so we had been dating for 10 months at this point and everything went downhill so quick that I can't understand so I need your help to process this

So for context you have to understand what happened in September of Last year .

In September, we were on a date, and she had said that only touching above the bra was okay.

During cuddling, by mistake, my hand went inside her bra in the heat of the moment, but I immediately pulled my hand out and completely apologized. I stayed with her, comforted her, and told her that I know what I did was wrong and that I’m sorry. I also assured her that I would never avoid taking accountability and responsibility and she accepted that what happened was wrong and that she trusts me that it wouldn't happen again.

Then, in October, she told me that she wasn’t comfortable with what had happened, so I talked to her again. She spoke to a friend and later told me that she would continue being with me and trust that it wouldn’t happen again. So here I kind of wasn't included in the decision making process at all. Infact later when I asked her in March if she thinks the Sept thing may affect our relationship in the future she said No. I was always open with her and let her express herself without saying anything in the manipulative sense yet now she says I manipulated her.

Now on 28th March , what happens is we have a midnight VC and I know she gets easily scared but I was in a joking mood so I kind of just yk scared her slightly and she screamed saying ,""Don't do this"", and then her parents came in hearing her scream and realised she was talking to me - a guy. She cut the call asap so i didn't know anything

So next time when she calls me after 5 to 10 mins ish I thought maybe everything was sorted out so I was so relived that I started crying when I picked up but I heard her brother's voice and I panicked and cut the call and then she calls me again and tells me that we have to stop talking and that she will block me from every platform now - and I could hear her brother cursing me in the background.

So the next day I see she has blocked me from everything - and I tried my last resort - we had a shared notes app where I had updated her asking for what happened.

There she texts me the following:

""Dont do anything , father has seen all the messages and they about the September thing and the January thing"" (when she came over to my house and nothing happened without her consent). ""He said he would do a police complaint but i convinced him on the grounds of no contact. And he is very serious so please don't try to contact me in any way""

""He has seen all chats. There's no way. They dont have a problem with you being a Bengali. It's the texts"" (the intimate texts I had with her)  ""and whatever happened in September. So it's better to stay away from me. Or dad will try to do a complaint. My family does have an issue and I dont want to do this please. There's no way my dad is going to let me be with you even if you are the most successful man. I don't want to talk anymore - Last text from my side""

 

After this the next day I try contacting her friends and she (ex-gf) and I have the following conversation on discord -

 

    **She:** i would like it if you don’t go around sending my friend’s any kind of request on instagram. i want you to know it’s really over between us and there’s no way you can contact me. i am the one who doesn’t want to talk to you, my family doesn’t have any problem. the whole reason being they made me understand that no guy would ever try to touch me like that. they have told me if any such thing happens in the future they can’t be of any help to me and also said that if someone does that even once then they think that guy must not have good intentions. i don’t think you understand how serious they are about making a police complaint against you. my father went to the family lawyer to ask but i said that everything was with my consent so it’s all okay. please don’t try to ruin it. it’s really over and nothing can change that. you can’t talk with any of my friends. please respect my privacy and leave. do you really think my parents would let me be with someone who sends me a paragraph about how he is gonna kill himself if we break up? no. they care about me and they are not upset with me yet. they are not even mentioning it like i did something wrong. my dad even told me that it’s not necessary that you find the right person everytime but you have to decide who you want to be with. i have decided and i don’t want to be with you. i can’t stay shit scared and on the verge of breaking down every single day. so stay away from me. it’s my decision to not be with you. they just made me block you instantly because they knew i would keep going back again to you because i really love you. 
     
    **He:** Can we talk 👉👈 Just for a few minutes 
     
    **She:** this is the explanation you are looking for. yk the whole reason i called you was because bhaiya was willing to talk to you because of me but then you go ahead and cry??? i am not looking to fight for this alone and i won’t fight for us. there is nothing to talk so we may not talk. 
     
    **He:** Can I talk to him? Baby i want to fight with you. 
     
    **She:** you can’t talk to him. 
     
    **He:** You're not alone please. 
     
    **She:** oh please stop. i don’t want to do this <my name>. 
     
    **He:** Baby i was crying because i was afraid. 
     
    **She:** please respect that. 
     
    **He:** I'm ready to talk baby like I said on the next call. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want anything. 
     
    **He:** Baby also the sept thing. Didn't we talk about it? That it was a mistake. And it never happened again. Even in Jan. Baby i was crying because I was afraid. But i want to talk to him please? 
     
    **She:** see the thing is i don’t want to talk. 
     
    **He:** Not of your brother. I was afraid of losing you. 
     
    **She:** i am done. 
     
    **He:** Why don't you want to talk baby? Why do we have to be done? I love you please. 
     
    **She:** because there’s no future. 
     
    **He:** Baby we decide our future nah? 
     
    **She:** and my dad won’t pull me out of this ever if i don’t stop now. 
     
    **He:** Baby wdym pull you out of it? 
     
    **She:** yes i have decided i don’t want to be with you. 
     
    **He:** Baby why? 
     
    **She:** you can read the paragraph. 
     
    **He:** I did. But baby didn't we talk about the September thing in detail? And didn't we establish it was a mistake and that it can never happen again? And it never did. *dif *did. Baby I am more than willing to talk to your parents. We can try. Please. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want to try. 
     
    **He:** Please baby. 
     
    **She:** don’t contact my friends. 
     
    **He:** Baby didn't we talk about the September thing? 
     
    **She:** what are you contacting my friends for? 
     
    **He:** What happened to what we had talked about regarding that? 
     
    **He:** To return you some final things. Please I can't live with them and I can't throw them too. Baby i didn't say I'd kms if we broke up. I wrote immediately uske baad ki I'd never do that because my <her name> won't like it. 
     
    **She:** throw them. 
     
    **He:** Baby i can't. Please understand my side a bit i can't throw it out. Baby regarding the September thing please tell me what happened. 
     
    **She:** you can’t give them to me either. 
     
    **He:** Um what if i give it to Your friend  and you can take the things you can and she throws away the rest? Please. 
     
    **He:** Please tell me what happened. Please let me talk to you or your parents. 
     
    **She:** no i don’t want you to contact my friends. 
     
    **She:** no we can’t. 
     
    **He:** I'll just Swiggy genie I won't meet her. Yk i was making plans that if Your friend  agrees we can only talk via her phone whenever you're in college. Baby what happened to the September thing please tell me. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want to talk to you. 
     
    **He:** Baby why? 
     
    **She:** i realised i was really naive to think that you did it galti se. 
     
    **She:** because i don’t want to. simple as that. 
     
    **He:** But baby it was a mistake in the heat of the moment. You know what kind of person I am I have been with you for 10 months. I never broke any boundaries after that. I was so careful after that. Baby i made a mistake ik but please understand it was a mistake in the heat of the moment. And i always took responsibility and accountability for it and that's all I could do. Trust me I want to change the past so bad but I can't so I did everything I could. I tried my best to make you feel comfortable to not make you feel like it wasn't something you couldn't talk about. Please baby talk to me? 
     
    **She:** the fact that it happened even once hurts so fucking much. you don’t understand that. you know when my dad got to know he cried and said ki tum hamari lakshmi ho aur aisa hogya tum humlog ko batayi bhi nahi. 
     
    **He:** Baby he said that because you didn't tell him. And baby it was a mistake. And i immediately removed my hand. Baby ik how much it hurts isliye i was always there for you. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want to talk to you. 
     
    **He:** I tried to comfort you so much. Um baby is this all because of the Sept thing? Because baby then can I talk to your family to explain it to them? So um is it all my fault? 
     
    **She:** no they have also seen the chats and the word document you sent me when you were preparing to send that to me through email and “end your life”. 
     
    **She:** no you may not. 
     
    **He:** Baby but um that was something else 👉👈. That's because I was feeling guilty. 
     
    **She:** i won’t say that. 
     
    **He:** About the sept thing. 
     
    **He:** So um should I not blame myself? Baby the word document wasn't to manipulate you. It was something i had actually prepared to send you if I ever did it 👉👈. It wasn't ever meant for you to see while I'm still here. 
     
    **She:** that’s all. 
     
    **He:** Baby please. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want to talk anymore. 
     
    **He:** Dont end it this way. Please. 
     
    **She:** it has to be. 
     
    **He:** Why baby? Why? Baby is it because of the September thing? 
     
    **She:** just tell me you won’t contact my friends again. and i will go. 
     
    **He:** Just Your friend  please to give you your things. 
     
    **She:** i don’t have much time. 
     
    **He:** Please don't go. Please. 
     
    **She:** no i don’t want anything.

    **He:** Please just take the evil eye keychain please. 
     
    **She:** no. 
     
    **He:** I can't baby. Baby please tell me what happened. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want it.

    **She:** please understand that. and leave your delusion. 
     
    **He:** Baby please don't call my love delusion?

    **He:** Like your parents told you to choose good and I'll show you I'm good. 
     
    **She:** you literally aren’t. 
     
    **He:** Because if it's the sept thing then we talked about it and i showed you I wasn't that kind of a guy. 
     
    **She:** but i don’t believe that. happy? now do whatever you want. 
     
    **He:** Why do you think so baby? Didn't I show you I'm always here for you, whenever you feel bad or good I'm always there for you? That I'm not someone who'd breach your boundaries? Except that once. 
     
    **He:** Is that the truth? 
     
    **She:** yes it is. 
     
    **He:** Baby can you tell me the truth about what you feel about September and me as a guy? Just that.

    **He:** Baby um wdym manipulated? 
     
    **She:** i don’t want to.

    **She:** i am not feeling overwhelmed. 
     
    **He:** Baby didn't know you were crying I was afraid that your mom found out about us. Baby please let me talk to him once. Baby i am always there for you. I have stopped myself from crying because I hear you crying. 
     
    **She:** you are not. i don’t want you. 
     
    **He:** Baby even when I felt hurt i tried talking through it. 
     
    **She:** let’s end this peacefully before my family gets involved. 
     
    **He:** Please understand I'm not someone who manipulated you or wasn't there for you. 
     
    **She:** this is the last time you are hearing from me. 
     
    **He:** So um. Do you not love me anymore? Can I give you one final health update? (Not in the manipulation sense it has a good ending too). 
     
    **She:** i will ask bhaiya if he wants to get the things from you so then you may contact him. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want it. 
     
    **He:** Baby can I talk to him then? Like regarding us? 
     
    **He:** Please? 
     
    **She:** it’s not that but i can’t keep doing this. 
     
    **She:** no. 
     
    **He:** Baby why? If you do love me can't we figure things out? Baby idk how you're feeling so i can't tell you what you're thinking but baby trust me I never manipulated you in the slightest. 
     
    **She:** if you are gonna say it then why are you even asking? 
     
    **He:** I'm asking for your permission. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want anything with you. understand that please. we won’t work out. 
     
    **He:** Baby why? 
     
    **She:** and i said no. 
     
    **He:** Ok i understand that. 
     
    **She:** i don’t know. 
     
    **He:** Baby please let us talk after a while. I'll talk to anyone you want. 
     
    **She:** promise me that you won’t contact anyone i know. 
     
    **She:** no. 
     
    **He:** Even your parents and brothers. Please. Just my one last wish. Please. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want you to talk to anyone. 
     
    **He:** And if it still didn't work out we won't talk ever. 
     
    **She:** stop itt. no you may not talk to them. 
     
    **He:** Just one last chance to show you I'm not what you think. 
     
    **She:** no. 
     
    **He:** Please baby. 
     
    **She:** i am blocking you. 
     
    **He:** One last conversation. Baby I'll show up to your college if I have to. Please. Just one last chance. 
     
    **She:** will tell my friends that too because you aren’t promising that you won’t contact them. 
     
    **He:** To show you I'm not who you're thinking currently. Baby i won't contact them. Just one last chance. 
     
    **She:** my dad will put a police complaint. 
     
    **He:** Please. Please baby. 
     
    **She:** and bhaiya transferred all the chats and photos to himself. 
     
    **He:** Baby do you think I'm a bad guy? 
     
    **She:** stop it. 
     
    **He:** Someone you shouldn't be with. 
     
    **She:** literally stop. 
     
    **He:** And um what changed between your understanding of sept? Like what happened? 
     
    **She:** i told you i don’t want to answer anything. 
     
    **He:** But baby then I'll never get closure. And I'll only blame myself. 
     
    **She:** that i was manipulated to think what i was thinking. 
     
    **He:** And um maybe don't check Pinterest because I sent an update there before. 
     
    **She:** not my problem. 
     
    **He:** But didn't you talk to your friend and come to that decision your self? Baby i wasn't involved in the decision making at all? 
     
    **She:** i am blocking you.
     

Now the kms document part that she mentions in the first paragraph - that her brother read never included anything like - I will kms if you leave me . It was back in October when I was in a very vulnerable state of mind and was feeling very overwhelmed with my own studies too when I had written that kind of suicide note.

 

We basically had fought in October regarding something else which also Included the September thing and in order to justify my state of mind during that time I had written and sent it - it wasn't sent as a way to tell her if you leave me I'll kms

 

The document I sent her reads as follows , which I had written before our October fight-  
 

    <Her name> by the time you'd be reading this note I'm probably in hell, so wave down once , i have probably been dead for 3 days now , and even in death I want to tell you that I love you and I'm only yours and this note is just the last message I want to give to you.
    Firstly, don't cry because I won't be there to care for you and ask you what happened and I
    won't be there beside you when you cry and that hurts.
    
    I just want you to know that you didn't do anything wrong , it's just like I told you , I wouldn't tell anyone when I actually kill myself , and seems like i will succeed in that this time around , yk the first time I contemplated suicide was when I came to know a girl did it when her parents weren'tat home because she felt she was a financial burden because of her neurological issues back in class 9 , she was the bench partner of one of my friends.
    
    Guess I walked down the same path as her I guess I was too much of a burden on everyone , i was a bad son who kept fucking up , bad brother who never knew what to do , bad student who used to cry before his Bengali exam and failed in maths, a bad boyfriend who never knew how to make others feel loved even though he loved them more than he loves himself.
    
    I feel bad for leaving you alone <Her name> because I know how you cry alone , how you hurt
    alone , how you try to handle everything alone and get anxious alone and I liked being there for you and now Im leaving you alone , maybe buy an orange cat and maybe who knows if im lucky enough I'll reincarnate into the one you buy
    
    So now the hard talk
    Why did I kill myself
    (There are two versions of this - pre and post Exam)
    -pre Exam version
    Well guess because I realized how much of a burden i was and i couldn't wait to stop being one on everyone and especially you my love because nothing hurts more than seeing you hurt and also maybe i realised ki CA inter isn't my cup of tea
    -post Exam version
    Well because i realised I keep failing, and God i hope i don't fail at killing myself and I don't mess it up because it's not worth the hassle to face the aftermath
    But yeah guess i failed my exams , well it was technically my fault so you can see this as my
    way of paying back
    (From this point on all the words are common for both the notes)
    Speaking of paying back , yk I still feel disgusted at myself for what happened on 4th , i always felt so helpless because I could see you were hurting and i couldn't do anything to help because I was the one who did that ,yk i felt so frustrated at my own helplessness , that I did that to the
    woman I Love, whose comfort was all i ever thought about , i wish I had an answer for why I did that, but i don't, i feel helpless even now
    But i feel a bit less helpless rn because hey there's something I can do rn
    Yk i contemplated suicide the night of 4th?
    But guess i can finally do that - ofc it's not because of that though but still who knows
    Also yk my grandmother used to say if you have an Unnatural death you come back as a ghost
    because they can't pour your ashes in the Ganges, so guess I'm returning as a ghost then , I
    wish I could kms as a ghost so I could atleast punish myself for 4th.
    So now there are some things I want to say mainly sorrys and how I failed at doing certain
    things
    Sorry for being your first love , your first boyfriend, your first kiss and your worst comforter ,
    sorry i couldn't make you feel loved ,sorry for not being there for you when you needed me ,
    sorry for always making you cry , sorry for always making you feel guilty , sorry for ruining your
    life <Her name>
    I love you and there were so many things I wanted to do with you but guess i can't do that
    anymore , i wanted to fly through the north pole with you , see the northern lights , see a sunrise
    and see the sunset with your head on my shoulder , hold your hands in a busy market, draw alta on your leg , draw alpona with you , lie on your lap in a grassy field , make coffee with you , read my favourite childhood stories to you , take turns watching the night sky through a telescope, there were so many things I wanted to do but i could never tell you
    I'll keep this short <Her name>
    Just know this that your Shontu Baby Loves you a lot and he will never stop loving you
    Let's meet in another life again <Her name> , a life where we can be happy together
    Lovingly,
    Your <my name>

That’s the end of all information I have  
I need your opinion to help process this . Idk what happened to my gf but this isn’t the gf I knew.  
I don’t know what to think or believe at this point.

I don’t think I ever manipulated her regarding anything especially not with the kms thing – which was made even before the breakup and in a completely different context and especially not the September thing – where I was nothing but open , I accepted my blame and was there for here and that’s all I did and she said she trusted me after that – multiple times on multiple dates throughout months, let me kiss her, hold her hands , she even came over in January where we were more intimate than ever and even told me she was comfortable with what we did in January , now idk how she’s telling me I manipulated her and that she was naïve to believe that I did it by mistake.

I don’t know what to think about anything at this point.",2,1743415350.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

✔ **Russia:** A major buyer of **Robusta coffee**, widely used in blends due to its strong flavor and competitive pricing.

✔ **Japan & South Korea:** Growing interest in **organic and single-origin coffee**, with a focus on high-quality brews.

1jnzlio,https://www.reddit.com/r/CICO/comments/1jnzlio/iron_supplements_increasing_appetite/,Iron supplements increasing appetite?,"I am 25f, started at 90kg, got to 75, fell off the wagon and got to 80, and now have gotten back down to 79. Also 5'3. I started taking iron supplements earlier this month, and its done absolute wonders for my chronic fatigue. Before, a lazy day was about 1k steps, now I get 3k steps even on a lazy day (I aim for 5k steps a day, on a ""normal"" day I crack that easy). I feel much better in an of myself, can do much more (also got prism glasses this month, so although I still have panic disorder/agoraphobia, going out, and walking around outside and in big indoor spaces is way easier than it ever was before. I managed a trip to lidl last week, which would've been impossible pre prism glasses). 



For context, i have had my iron levels tested at the doctors fifty billion times, and I always come out at the low end of normal. I am prone to vitamin deficiencies in general,  and i believe i did used to struggle with iron deficiency anemia, but my old gp's were atrocious, so i don't remember being treated for it. My thyroid results were similarly low end of normal, and I was diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism, and take levothyroxine, which has been good for my energy and anxiety. Why my gp's don't consider my iron subclinically low is beyond me. I am an ethnic turk living in the uk, so it is possible that I may need more iron than your average white brit (this is the case with vitamin d, and i get vitamin d on prescription,  which i also find helpful). My mum gave me her spare grocery store iron supplements to try, and they've been so good for my energy,  that i feel iron is an absolute godsend for me. For the first time in years I don't feel constantly exhausted, and now i don't rely on coffee to function. 



The one problem im having is that my appetite has increased. When I was a sendentary slug of a woman, staying at 1500cal was doable, now even when I'm strict on myself, I can't really eat less than 1700cal. To be fair I'm way more active than I was, but i would like to maintain a decent deficit.



 I have a fitbit, and i love it because the sleep tracking, heart rate tracking, and step tracking is stellar, and it has a nice long battery, but it doesn't pair that well with mfp. I have my mfp calorie goal at 1500, and mfp does add the excerise calories, but obviously my maintenance is higher than 1500cal (last i checked it was around 1750cal ish, I haven't checked my body fat % in a while, I really need to do that). The fitbit app itself is similarly useless, it does tell me how many calories I burned, and generally speaking i burn at least 2000cal every day, but it doesn't connect very well to mfp on its own app either, so yesterday it was convinced I'd only eaten 400cal the entire day, when in reality that was breakfast and lunch (pre soda, i went to megacon yesterday and had two orange ramunes), and it just completely neglected to count my freakishly large dinner (megacon wiped me the hell out, and it was so hot in the convention hall, outside, and in the car, so i had a lot of ice cream, my actual dinner which was steak and quinoa, and 2 small bags of popcorn).



Does anyone have experience with iron tablets and fitbits? Does the increased appetite with iron come down eventually? And is there a way to make the fitbit work smoothly with mfp? Tia!",1,1743415114.0,CICO,1,1.0,False

One of them is my cousin who lives in America. She's my age and is working at a company. 

The other elder ladies also liked the choice and asked me about her. I straightforwadly said nope...because I'm against cousin marriage and don't even know her. 

Don't want to know her either. 

Fastforward 2 months and she comes to Pakistan for two weeks with her dad. 

AND 

They both get invited to our house. 

They weren't coming for the shaadi BUT it was definitely gonna be brought up during the typical Chaye shaye convos. 

I didnt't even meet them, judt escaped and went to a nearby cafe with a book and chilled there with ma coffee, phone and book. 😎 

Okay... 

I came back home and mom seemed pissed and said ""she was so nice, well mannered, even wore shalwar kameez and dupatta and served me tea."" 

Like bro she was showing herself like those Tabedaar wafadaar biwee from 90's Pak dramas. 
I know it seemed really wrong considering she's from America and works there. 

The moment of truth came when my sis showed me her insta page. Sis was there with cousin when she was here. 

Her insta page was filled with her pics in bikini and the lil undie. So nanga panga. 😭 + she had selfies with goray boys at parties and stuff...💀

My sister laughed and said I should tell mom. But I didn't cuz it would hurt mom's feelings and ruin her ""dream bahoo"" fantasy lol.

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. Not enjoying Atomfall. 

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook.


I like coffee too.

I studied smarter, not just harder pinpointing weak spots, mastering tricky scenarios, and building confidence one click at a time. Late nights turned into “aha!” moments, and doubt started fading.  
Test day came, and I walked in ready to fight. The questions flew, but I stayed steady. When the screen went black, I held my breath—then the email came: “Pass.” Tears hit the floor before I could stop them. From stumble to success, Naxlex turned my second shot into a knockout punch.

Hey MaximizeMe crew! 😄 Ever feel like the clock’s always out to get you? Like you’re running on a treadmill that just keeps speeding up? Yep, been there. Just a few months back, I felt like my to-do list had cloned itself overnight, and I could never catch up. But guess what? I've managed to reclaim a solid 10 hours a week, all thanks to the magic of habit stacking. Curious how? Let’s dive in!

**First off, what the heck is habit stacking?** 🤔 Imagine Legos for your daily routine—one solid habit is your sturdy base, and you build on it with related little habits, one by one. This turns boring tasks into seamless sequences. Plus, your brain just loves habits; makes everything feel so dang efficient.

Here's how I pulled it off:

1. **Identify Your Anchor Habits:**
   - Morning coffee ritual? *Yep, that’s mine.* ☕️
   - Brushing your teeth? *You go, minty fresh hero!*

2. **Stack Those Bad Boys:**
   - While my coffee brews (and the aroma gently reminds me of life’s little joys), I **write one gratitude note.** It takes 2 minutes but shifts my mindset instantly. Grateful mindset = productive day.

3. **Combine Tasks:**
   - Listen to a podcast or audiobook while prepping meals. *Gordon Ramsay meets Stephen King kinda vibe, amirite?* 🎧🍴

4. **Evening Wind Down:**
   - Already chillin’ with Netflix? Do it while stretching or on a stationary bike. You’ll thank me later when you’ve binged a whole season and got in an hour of exercise. 🏃‍♂️💪

5. **Pro Tip Alert 🚨:**
   - Use a *habit tracker.* Seeing that satisfying streak of completed habits will have you saying, “Take that, Universe!” It’s the dopamine hit you didn’t know you needed.

Now, I didn't say this was a quick fix. There was failure, success, and some weird in-between. But these small changes, repeated consistently, stacked (heh) my day with time I didn't even know I had. Suddenly, I’m 'that' friend who reads more books, changes for workouts, and has time for spontaneous adventures—or at least that extra episode of my favorite series. 😅

What about you guys? Anyone here keen on trying out habit stacking? Maybe you’ve got some ninja tips of your own to share? Let’s chat about the chaos and victories you’ve faced on this relentless mission of personal betterment!",1,1743414260.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

When the time comes (I for one will not be alive), I hope the TI families and surviving TIs will be brave enough to ask for proper compensation. 


But how to calculate compensation for such hideous crimes.


Imagine if someone spilled a hot boiling coffee on your brain, every fucking night, for 10 years. The comparison is perfect, because the excruciating pain plus the psychological distress at witnessing your own brain depatterning, plus the traumatic verbal abuse V2K, compensate for the lack of physical burns (although sometimes burn marks do appear on the skin!).


So, 365 * 10 * ~1 million dollars (see link above).

This amount is the minimum calculation, and absolutely should be increased based on many other considerations (loss of opportunity, excruciating distress due to sleep deprivation, Mafia profits from the original brain, etc etc etc)",1,1743414160.0,IllusionOfFreedom,1,1.0,False

# My Languages:

* **Greek**: Native tongue.
* **English**: C2 level (Cambridge); I’ve been using it academically and professionally for many years.
* **Japanese**: Officially at N4 level, but my understanding is higher due to consuming extensive content over the past four years, traveling to Japan, and speaking the language. I’m well-versed in Japanese history and have a deep passion for Japanese culture (beyond just anime!).
* **French**: I reached B2 level at 16yo but have since forgotten much. I restarted learning a few months ago and improving it is my current focus!

I list some topics below in which we can have an interesting conversation in French and any other language (or combination of languages)! Let’s have a small coffee break and see if we can help each other out! If you are a fellow Japanophile or find any of the following interesting we will certainly have a good time!

# Possible Conversation Topics:

* **Language Learning**: How to learn languages through immersion?
* **Everything About Greece**:
   * Society, culture, and today’s political scene.
   * Greek history: from Ancient Greece to the modern state.
   * The Greek language: differences from Ancient Greek.
* **Everything About Japan**:
   * Planning a trip: tips, must-see places, and things to avoid.
   * Japanese history, culture, and politics.
   * The Japanese language: best methods to learn it (AKA why is kanji so difficult  ).
* **CERN**: How is life/doing research here. etc etc
* **Traveling, literature, engineering, satellites**, and many other topics.
* **Anything that interests you!**

Key Levels from Bookmap and Chart

Sell-Side Zones:

	•	82,500–83,500: multiple red clusters above price, showing resting asks and absorption attempts. These are now acting as short-term resistance.
	•	84,000–85,000: prior area of dense liquidity and failed support — likely to be defended by sellers if price bounces.
	•	87,000–88,800: still the primary sell zone — previously absorbed every breakout.
	•	92,000–92,500: marked as liquidity sweep zone — if market squeezes, stop clusters might get triggered here for a fast upside move.

Buy-Side Zones:

	•	81,500–80,500: current local support; Bookmap shows multiple green walls stacked below.
	•	81,000 and 80,000: visible clusters of limit bids; if price dips into these levels, expect buyer reaction.
	•	77,000–78,000: next significant macro-level support based on HTF liquidity heatmaps.

⸻

Structure & Trend:

	•	We are trading at the edge of the “Strong Buy Zone” as highlighted in the chart.

	•	Price failed to break out of the Sell Zone / Stop Cluster above 88K — a move that has now fully retraced.

	•	Price compression between 80K–84K suggests we are in the setup phase before expansion.

	•	Most recent candles show heavy absorption of market sells — but trend remains fragile and could still trap late sellers or shorts.

⸻

What to Watch:

	•	Breakdown of 80,500 could trigger deeper flushes to 78K and below.

	•	Bounce from 81K–80K likely to be fast and violent — due to stop hunts and illiquidity.

	•	If bulls can reclaim 83,500, we may retest 85–86K quickly.

	•	Upside liquidity pocket at 92K remains untouched and tempting if shorts get squeezed.

⸻

Final Thought:

This is a classic liquidity setup. We’re sitting at the edge of a high interest zone.
Buyers are defending low ground. Sellers are waiting higher. The book is full of traps on both sides.

We are not prophets. We’re just traders reacting to supply, demand, and liquidity. Stay sharp, stay adaptive.

I have a 2015 Alfa Romeo Giulietta with the 1.4 T-Jet engine (non-multiair) also found in many Fiats and Abarths.

It's a simple 4 pot with a turbocharger. Ever since I had the car after I drive if I park it for 30 minutes then restart it, I get a hot/burn oil smell in the cabin. You know how you get the first whiff of air after a coffee break restart and it's hot? Mine is the same, but oily hot. 

No visible oil leaks and the engine is not consuming oil. As far as I know rocker cover was replaced by the previous owner. 

I was wondering if there was any tools/tips I could use to check for leaks. Maybe sparying soapy water to connections/seals like the PCV hoses to see if it bubbles up or something like that?

I'm fairly handy with a ratchet, but I would also not spend money on all kinds of gasket if there's a tool I can check it with first.

Between language barriers, cultural differences, and homesickness, adjusting takes time.

Here’s what helped me (and might help you too!):

✔ **Create a routine** – Familiarity helps reduce anxiety. Even simple habits like morning coffee at the same café can make a difference.

✔ **Learn the language (at least the basics!)** – Even a few phrases can make daily life easier and help you connect with locals.

✔ **Find a support system** – Other expats understand what you're going through. Join Facebook groups, local meetups, or online communities.

✔ **Be patient with yourself** – Adjusting takes time. Celebrate small wins, like successfully ordering food in the local language!

✔ **Seek guidance if needed** – If you’re struggling, consider [expat coaching](https://xpattitudes.com/) to navigate challenges. Having someone who understands can make all the difference.

Ok so we had been dating for 10 months at this point and everything went downhill so quick that I can't understand so I need your help to process this

So for context you have to understand what happened in September of Last year .

In September, we were on a date, and she had said that only touching above the bra was okay.

During cuddling, by mistake, my hand went inside her bra in the heat of the moment, but I immediately pulled my hand out and completely apologized. I stayed with her, comforted her, and told her that I know what I did was wrong and that I’m sorry. I also assured her that I would never avoid taking accountability and responsibility and she accepted that what happened was wrong and that she trusts me that it wouldn't happen again.

Then, in October, she told me that she wasn’t comfortable with what had happened, so I talked to her again. She spoke to a friend and later told me that she would continue being with me and trust that it wouldn’t happen again. So here I kind of wasn't included in the decision making process at all. Infact later when I asked her in March if she thinks the Sept thing may affect our relationship in the future she said No. I was always open with her and let her express herself without saying anything in the manipulative sense yet now she says I manipulated her.

Now on 28th March , what happens is we have a midnight VC and I know she gets easily scared but I was in a joking mood so I kind of just yk scared her slightly and she screamed saying ,""Don't do this"", and then her parents came in hearing her scream and realised she was talking to me - a guy. She cut the call asap so i didn't know anything

So next time when she calls me after 5 to 10 mins ish I thought maybe everything was sorted out so I was so relived that I started crying when I picked up but I heard her brother's voice and I panicked and cut the call and then she calls me again and tells me that we have to stop talking and that she will block me from every platform now - and I could hear her brother cursing me in the background.

So the next day I see she has blocked me from everything - and I tried my last resort - we had a shared notes app where I had updated her asking for what happened.

There she texts me the following:

""Dont do anything , father has seen all the messages and they about the September thing and the January thing"" (when she came over to my house and nothing happened without her consent). ""He said he would do a police complaint but i convinced him on the grounds of no contact. And he is very serious so please don't try to contact me in any way""

""He has seen all chats. There's no way. They dont have a problem with you being a Bengali. It's the texts"" (the intimate texts I had with her)  ""and whatever happened in September. So it's better to stay away from me. Or dad will try to do a complaint. My family does have an issue and I dont want to do this please. There's no way my dad is going to let me be with you even if you are the most successful man. I don't want to talk anymore - Last text from my side""

 

After this the next day I try contacting her friends and she (ex-gf) and I have the following conversation on discord -

 



    **She:** i would like it if you don’t go around sending my friend’s any kind of request on instagram. i want you to know it’s really over between us and there’s no way you can contact me. i am the one who doesn’t want to talk to you, my family doesn’t have any problem. the whole reason being they made me understand that no guy would ever try to touch me like that. they have told me if any such thing happens in the future they can’t be of any help to me and also said that if someone does that even once then they think that guy must not have good intentions. i don’t think you understand how serious they are about making a police complaint against you. my father went to the family lawyer to ask but i said that everything was with my consent so it’s all okay. please don’t try to ruin it. it’s really over and nothing can change that. you can’t talk with any of my friends. please respect my privacy and leave. do you really think my parents would let me be with someone who sends me a paragraph about how he is gonna kill himself if we break up? no. they care about me and they are not upset with me yet. they are not even mentioning it like i did something wrong. my dad even told me that it’s not necessary that you find the right person everytime but you have to decide who you want to be with. i have decided and i don’t want to be with you. i can’t stay shit scared and on the verge of breaking down every single day. so stay away from me. it’s my decision to not be with you. they just made me block you instantly because they knew i would keep going back again to you because i really love you.

    **He:** To return you some final things. Please I can't live with them and I can't throw them too. Baby i didn't say I'd kms if we broke up. I wrote immediately uske baad ki I'd never do that because my <her name> won't like it. 
     
    **She:** throw them. 
     
    **He:** Baby i can't. Please understand my side a bit i can't throw it out. Baby regarding the September thing please tell me what happened. 
     
    **She:** you can’t give them to me either. 
     
    **He:** Um what if i give it to Your friend  and you can take the things you can and she throws away the rest? Please. 
     
    **He:** Please tell me what happened. Please let me talk to you or your parents.

    **She:** i don’t want to talk to you.

    **She:** i realised i was really naive to think that you did it galti se. 
     
    **She:** because i don’t want to. simple as that. 
     
    **He:** But baby it was a mistake in the heat of the moment. You know what kind of person I am I have been with you for 10 months. I never broke any boundaries after that. I was so careful after that. Baby i made a mistake ik but please understand it was a mistake in the heat of the moment. And i always took responsibility and accountability for it and that's all I could do. Trust me I want to change the past so bad but I can't so I did everything I could. I tried my best to make you feel comfortable to not make you feel like it wasn't something you couldn't talk about. Please baby talk to me? 
     
    **She:** the fact that it happened even once hurts so fucking much. you don’t understand that. you know when my dad got to know he cried and said ki tum hamari lakshmi ho aur aisa hogya tum humlog ko batayi bhi nahi. 
     
    **He:** Baby he said that because you didn't tell him. And baby it was a mistake. And i immediately removed my hand. Baby ik how much it hurts isliye i was always there for you. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want to talk to you. 
     
    **He:** I tried to comfort you so much. Um baby is this all because of the Sept thing? Because baby then can I talk to your family to explain it to them? So um is it all my fault? 
     
    **She:** no they have also seen the chats and the word document you sent me when you were preparing to send that to me through email and “end your life”. 
     
    **She:** no you may not.

    **She:** yk how angry my bhaiya was that the guy i chose for myself is fucking crying instead of being there for me. you know how broken i felt then? 
     
    **She:** i am not feeling overwhelmed. 
     
    **He:** Baby didn't know you were crying I was afraid that your mom found out about us. Baby please let me talk to him once. Baby i am always there for you. I have stopped myself from crying because I hear you crying. 
     
    **She:** you are not. i don’t want you. 
     
    **He:** Baby even when I felt hurt i tried talking through it. 
     
    **She:** let’s end this peacefully before my family gets involved. 
     
    **He:** Please understand I'm not someone who manipulated you or wasn't there for you. 
     
    **She:** this is the last time you are hearing from me. 
     
    **He:** So um. Do you not love me anymore? Can I give you one final health update? (Not in the manipulation sense it has a good ending too). 
     
    **She:** i will ask bhaiya if he wants to get the things from you so then you may contact him. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want it. 
     
    **He:** Baby can I talk to him then? Like regarding us? 
     
    **He:** Please? 
     
    **She:** it’s not that but i can’t keep doing this. 
     
    **She:** no. 
     
    **He:** Baby why? If you do love me can't we figure things out? Baby idk how you're feeling so i can't tell you what you're thinking but baby trust me I never manipulated you in the slightest. 
     
    **She:** if you are gonna say it then why are you even asking? 
     
    **He:** I'm asking for your permission. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want anything with you. understand that please. we won’t work out. 
     
    **He:** Baby why? 
     
    **She:** and i said no. 
     
    **He:** Ok i understand that. 
     
    **She:** i don’t know. 
     
    **He:** Baby please let us talk after a while. I'll talk to anyone you want. 
     
    **She:** promise me that you won’t contact anyone i know. 
     
    **She:** no. 
     
    **He:** Even your parents and brothers. Please. Just my one last wish. Please. 
     
    **She:** i don’t want you to talk to anyone. 
     
    **He:** And if it still didn't work out we won't talk ever. 
     
    **She:** stop itt. no you may not talk to them. 
     
    **He:** Just one last chance to show you I'm not what you think. 
     
    **She:** no. 
     
    **He:** Please baby. 
     
    **She:** i am blocking you. 
     
    **He:** One last conversation. Baby I'll show up to your college if I have to. Please. Just one last chance. 
     
    **She:** will tell my friends that too because you aren’t promising that you won’t contact them. 
     
    **He:** To show you I'm not who you're thinking currently. Baby i won't contact them. Just one last chance. 
     
    **She:** my dad will put a police complaint. 
     
    **He:** Please. Please baby.

    **She:** stop it. 
     
    **He:** Someone you shouldn't be with. 
     
    **She:** literally stop. 
     
    **He:** And um what changed between your understanding of sept? Like what happened? 
     
    **She:** i told you i don’t want to answer anything. 
     
    **He:** But baby then I'll never get closure. And I'll only blame myself. 
     
    **She:** that i was manipulated to think what i was thinking. 
     
    **He:** And um maybe don't check Pinterest because I sent an update there before. 
     
    **She:** not my problem. 
     
    **He:** But didn't you talk to your friend and come to that decision your self? Baby i wasn't involved in the decision making at all? 
     
    **She:** i am blocking you.
     

Now the kms document part that she mentions in the first paragraph - that her brother read never included anything like - I will kms if you leave me . It was back in October when I was in a very vulnerable state of mind and was feeling very overwhelmed with my own studies too when I had written that kind of suicide note.

 

We basically had fought in October regarding something else which also Included the September thing and in order to justify my state of mind during that time I had written and sent it - it wasn't sent as a way to tell her if you leave me I'll kms

 

The document I sent her reads as follows , which I had written before our October fight-  
 

    <Her name> by the time you'd be reading this note I'm probably in hell, so wave down once , i have probably been dead for 3 days now , and even in death I want to tell you that I love you and I'm only yours and this note is just the last message I want to give to you.
    Firstly, don't cry because I won't be there to care for you and ask you what happened and I
    won't be there beside you when you cry and that hurts.
    
    I just want you to know that you didn't do anything wrong , it's just like I told you , I wouldn't tell anyone when I actually kill myself , and seems like i will succeed in that this time around , yk the first time I contemplated suicide was when I came to know a girl did it when her parents weren'tat home because she felt she was a financial burden because of her neurological issues back in class 9 , she was the bench partner of one of my friends.
    
    Guess I walked down the same path as her I guess I was too much of a burden on everyone , i was a bad son who kept fucking up , bad brother who never knew what to do , bad student who used to cry before his Bengali exam and failed in maths, a bad boyfriend who never knew how to make others feel loved even though he loved them more than he loves himself.
    
    I feel bad for leaving you alone <Her name> because I know how you cry alone , how you hurt
    alone , how you try to handle everything alone and get anxious alone and I liked being there for you and now Im leaving you alone , maybe buy an orange cat and maybe who knows if im lucky enough I'll reincarnate into the one you buy
    
    So now the hard talk
    Why did I kill myself
    (There are two versions of this - pre and post Exam)
    -pre Exam version
    Well guess because I realized how much of a burden i was and i couldn't wait to stop being one on everyone and especially you my love because nothing hurts more than seeing you hurt and also maybe i realised ki CA inter isn't my cup of tea
    -post Exam version
    Well because i realised I keep failing, and God i hope i don't fail at killing myself and I don't mess it up because it's not worth the hassle to face the aftermath
    But yeah guess i failed my exams , well it was technically my fault so you can see this as my
    way of paying back
    (From this point on all the words are common for both the notes)
    Speaking of paying back , yk I still feel disgusted at myself for what happened on 4th , i always felt so helpless because I could see you were hurting and i couldn't do anything to help because I was the one who did that ,yk i felt so frustrated at my own helplessness , that I did that to the
    woman I Love, whose comfort was all i ever thought about , i wish I had an answer for why I did that, but i don't, i feel helpless even now
    But i feel a bit less helpless rn because hey there's something I can do rn
    Yk i contemplated suicide the night of 4th?
    But guess i can finally do that - ofc it's not because of that though but still who knows
    Also yk my grandmother used to say if you have an Unnatural death you come back as a ghost
    because they can't pour your ashes in the Ganges, so guess I'm returning as a ghost then , I
    wish I could kms as a ghost so I could atleast punish myself for 4th.
    So now there are some things I want to say mainly sorrys and how I failed at doing certain
    things
    Sorry for being your first love , your first boyfriend, your first kiss and your worst comforter ,
    sorry i couldn't make you feel loved ,sorry for not being there for you when you needed me ,
    sorry for always making you cry , sorry for always making you feel guilty , sorry for ruining your
    life <Her name>
    I love you and there were so many things I wanted to do with you but guess i can't do that
    anymore , i wanted to fly through the north pole with you , see the northern lights , see a sunrise
    and see the sunset with your head on my shoulder , hold your hands in a busy market, draw alta on your leg , draw alpona with you , lie on your lap in a grassy field , make coffee with you , read my favourite childhood stories to you , take turns watching the night sky through a telescope, there were so many things I wanted to do but i could never tell you
    I'll keep this short <Her name>
    Just know this that your Shontu Baby Loves you a lot and he will never stop loving you
    Let's meet in another life again <Her name> , a life where we can be happy together
    Lovingly,
    Your <my name>
    

That’s the end of all information I have  
I need your opinion to help process this . Idk what happened to my gf but this isn’t the gf I knew.  
I don’t know what to think or believe at this point.  
  
I don’t think I ever manipulated her regarding anything especially not with the kms thing – which was made even before the breakup and in a completely different context and especially not the September thing – where I was nothing but open , I accepted my blame and was there for here and that’s all I did and she said she trusted me after that – multiple times on multiple dates throughout months, let me kiss her, hold her hands , she even came over in January where we were more intimate than ever and even told me she was comfortable with what we did in January , now idk how she’s telling me I manipulated her and that she was naïve to believe that I did it by mistake.  


I don’t know what to think about anything at this point.

I recently started talking to someone, and our conversations have been great we text a lot, and I genuinely enjoy getting to know them. They seem like an amazing person, and I really like their voice. The issue is that they’re not exactly my usual type physically, and I’m hesitant about whether attraction will grow over time.

They suggested meeting up for coffee soon, and I’m open to seeing where things lead. I just don’t want to lead them on if I don’t end up feeling that spark. Has anyone been in a similar situation where attraction developed later? How did you handle it?

I am relatively new to this way of eating but I recently for a few weeks due to getting very sick from either a raw egg or chicken that I ate this gave me chronic diarrhoea/chronically dehydration stomach cramps and stopped me from eating anything for 2 days lost 2kg in body weight took me a whole day of drinking coconut water to feel normal again but otherwise I feel so good when I eat raw meat prior to this was eating traditional carnivore cooked carnivore and am struggling to get/eat enough calories in a day without having to make myself sick from butter due to having no appetite I have a few questions 


I have tried this raw meat based way of eating before and here’s what I’ve noticed 

Chronic severe reoccurring cystic acne was going away I’ve struggled with this since I was 19 am now 22

I get healthy appetite and can eat a kg of raw beef in one or multiple sittings 

I don’t feel sluggish after eating 

I put on weight which is great to me as I have struggled with maintaining healthy weight for most of my life 

My skin/face looks more full

I don’t really know when I’m thirsty except for in the morning or until I realise I’m pretty dehydrated by the end of the day 

Increased mental clarity 

Sometimes makes me crave sugar 

Weird slimy feeling in my mouth when I wake up 
(I don’t know if this is normal or eventually goes away)

Takes me longer to fall asleep at night even though I get lots of sun during the day and live in a warmer environment 

.I wake up earlier

.Sometimes I will get stomach cramps

.i Don’t feel full till at least an hour after eating which can cause me to over eat sometimes 

Some questions I have are 
.i cant get access to raw dairy or unsalted dairy can I make my own culture by .eg spitting in a bottle of goat kefir and leaving at room temperature?

.can I eat pasteurised organic unsalted butter?

Why dose any salt make me feel like sht.?
What should I do for electrolytes?

.is lots of olive oil with my meat meals okay?

.When do I drink water?

.Can I have cold brew light coffee?

.Why do raw tomatoes/juice and celery juice make me feel so good? (I have tried these both recently)

.are store bought free range (organic eggs okay?)

.can I still drink meat/chicken stocks? These have helped me in the past 

.how do I make this work socially? (I live a pretty social lifestyle and have to hide this way I eat from 
Friends and family which can make me feel very outcasted at times can I still get these benefits if I slightly sear meat and leave inside raw for eg. if I go out to eat somewhere will a seared/very rare/blue rare steak still give me the benefits to this diet?

.Dose anyone else live socially while following this way of eating? if so how do you make it work 

.can I still eat coconut oil?

.Can I still brush my teeth/oil pulling with coconut oil

.Can I or/should I be adding spices? Like mustard ect which are recommend by Aajonus 

.when should I open-close my eating window I am never hungry for at least a few hours after waking up and I also don’t like to eat during/or close to night time

.can I eat canned wild caught sardines in spring water?

.is it okay to freeze my grass fed ground beef/or lamb/organs that I buy from a butchers

.How to eat this way while travelling or/camping?

.Any other things I should incorporate?
I am very sensitive to high fiber or high sugar /starch I also have allergy’s to latex fruits such as bananas and avocados and pineapples 

Apologies for the amount of questions I want to pursue the benefits and heal myself from a life of poor nutrition through this way of eating if there is anyone who can give me advice would be much appreciated 🙏🙏

Derby’s got a brand-new live venue and they’re launching it like legends.

Deco and Cassette Roulette are tearing up the stage for opening night. Proper local talent. Big sound. Crowd going wild. You in the middle of it, wondering why every gig isn’t like this.

And yeah, it’s a fiver. Not £50. Not “+ fees.” Just five quid. All of it goes back into making Becketwell better.

This is your chance to say *“I was there when it started.”* Don’t sit at home scrolling TikTok. Get yourself in the room.

Bengal Kitchen isn’t just doing Indian food. It’s throwing spice bombs at your tastebuds and asking politely if you’d like another. From sizzling tandoori lamb chops to creamy butter chicken that tastes like a hug in a bowl, every dish hits just right.

The Desi village-style curries are the real deal, and if you’ve never tried their Bengal Garlic Chilli Chicken, fix that immediately. Oh—and every order over £15 for collection gets 10% off, so it’s basically saving money. Sort of.

Big flavours, friendly service, and naan that’s fluffier than your nan’s throw pillows. What more do you want?

This isn’t just “food court Italian.” It’s *actual* Italian—with buttery burrata, beef ragu that’s been simmering since last Tuesday, and spinach balls that could probably win Britain’s Got Talent.

The Penne Giardiniera? Iconic. The Seafood Linguine? Basically a Roman holiday in a bowl. And the Profiterole & Pistachio? Good luck sharing it.

Carluccio’s keeps it simple, nails every dish, and somehow makes a trip to Derbion feel like date night in Florence—minus the flight and the faff.

Not quite ready for the full 10K? No worries. This one's for the kids, families, and anyone who fancies a gentler jog with a big crowd feel.

The route’s a lovely loop by the river around Pride Park, starting and finishing where the pros do. Runners under 8 need a grown-up alongside, and if you've done the main race, you can hop in for free with your little ones.

It’s fun, easygoing, and a great way to be part of Derby’s biggest running day, without needing a protein shake after.

1jnyzaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1jnyzaf/denials_reflection/,Denial's Reflection,"Sarah wakes up with a smile.

She makes herself do it, curves her lips just right, feels the stretch of skin, the press of teeth. It's important to start the day right.

The house is quiet, just the way she likes it. The curtains are open, sunlight spilling across the wooden floors, golden and warm. The air smells like fresh coffee and vanilla candles. A perfect morning.

She pads into the kitchen, humming softly. The fridge is stocked with all her favorites—fresh fruit, yogurt, little things that make life good. She spoons blueberries into a bowl, drizzles honey on top.

“This is nice,” she says out loud, letting her voice fill the empty space. “I’m happy.”

The words feel solid. Real.

But the silence that follows is heavy.

She eats, watching the clock. She has the whole day ahead of her. Endless possibilities. Maybe she’ll read. Maybe she’ll go for a walk. Maybe she’ll call a friend—except, no, she doesn’t have many of those anymore. That’s okay. I like my own company.

She repeats the thought like a mantra.

After breakfast, she showers, brushes her hair, picks out her favorite dress. The mirror shows a pretty girl with bright eyes and smooth skin. She tilts her head, testing different smiles. Some look wrong. Some look fake. But eventually, she finds one that seems right.

*There. Happy.*

The house is still too quiet. She turns on music, something light and cheerful. It fills the space, but not the way she wants. It only makes the silence more noticeable when it stops.

Her hands tremble.

She clenches them into fists, forces a deep breath.

“I’m happy,” she says again.

She spends the afternoon keeping busy, tidying things that don’t need to be tidied, making lists of things she already knows she won’t do. The air feels heavier now, pressing against her skin, wrapping around her ribs.

She sits on the couch, staring at the blank television screen.

The reflection stares back.

And then, movement.

Just for a second. A flicker. Almost like a frown. A distortion of her reflection, like the glass is warping, like her own face doesn’t belong to her anymore.

Her breath hitches. She blinks.

Everything is normal.

I imagined it.

She laughs, but it’s thin, shaky.

She forces herself to stand, to keep moving. Maybe a walk will help. Maybe some fresh air.

But as she reaches for the door, she hesitates.

The silence behind her is suffocating.

Her own home, so carefully curated, so safe and warm and perfect, it doesn’t feel like hers anymore.

The reflection in the dark screen is still watching, still frowning. 

Her heartbeat pounds in her ears.

And then, just as she steps out—

A whisper, from somewhere deep inside the house.

I’m Christoforos, a 23-year-old Greek working at CERN! I’m looking for French-speaking (and possibly Japanese-speaking) people to have discussions with to practice these languages. I love learning languages and am a huge fan of immersion-based learning!

# My Languages:

* **Greek**: Native tongue.
* **English**: C2 level (Cambridge); I’ve been using it academically and professionally for many years.
* **Japanese**: Officially at N4 level, but my understanding is higher due to consuming extensive content over the past four years, traveling to Japan, and speaking the language. I’m well-versed in Japanese history and have a deep passion for Japanese culture (beyond just anime!).
* **French**: I reached B2 level at 16yo but have since forgotten much. I restarted learning a few months ago and improving it is my current focus!

I list some topics below in which we can have an interesting conversation in French and any other language (or combination of languages)! Let’s have a small coffee break and see if we can help each other out! If you are a fellow Japanophile or find any of the following interesting we will certainly have a good time!

# Possible Conversation Topics:

* **Language Learning**: How to learn languages through immersion?
* **Everything About Greece**:
   * Society, culture, and today’s political scene.
   * Greek history: from Ancient Greece to the modern state.
   * The Greek language: differences from Ancient Greek.
* **Everything About Japan**:
   * Planning a trip: tips, must-see places, and things to avoid.
   * Japanese history, culture, and politics.
   * The Japanese language: best methods to learn it (AKA why is kanji so difficult  ).
* **CERN**: How is life/doing research here. etc etc 
* **Traveling, literature, engineering, satellites**, and many other topics.
* **Anything that interests you!**

1jnysan,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jnysan/plasticeletrical_burnt_smell_mahlkonig_vario/,Plastic/eletrical burnt smell [Mahlkonig Vario],"I've owned a Mahlkonig Vario (same as the Baratza, used to be sold/produced in Europe by Mahlkonig) for about 11 years. A couple of years ago it start doing these clacking noises and smelling weird which turned out to be a dying motor.

Even though the model was out of production (probably when Baratza moved on to the new Varios and Mahlkonig to their own models), I was still able to get a replacement motor, replaced it myself and it's been working fine so far.

A few days ago I started smelling burnt plastic or the smell or something eletrical again. This time it's a bit different, because I can feel it in the coffee and the smell goes into the basket. The motor seems fine? It doesn't make the noises the older motor did and the smell doesn't seem like it comes from the motor.

I haven't opened it further yet so i wonder if it could be something in the front panel circuit board that could be burning up (the visible circuit board behind the motor also seems fine).

I'll probably try to open it up further to check later on, but I was wondering if anyone here had similiar experiences.

Replacement parts for this model seem hard to find nowadays in Europe anyway,, so maybe it's finally time to retire this faithful grinder.

EDIT: Quick update. After posting this I did a quick search on how to remove the front panel which was much easier than I thought and looked a the circuit board and cable. All seems fine. I guess I'll have to take apart the motor again later on and inspect the remainder of the main circuit board and cables.",1,1743411370.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1jnypru,https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/1jnypru/fifth_week_on_omad_progress_report/,"Fifth week on OMAD, Progress report","Hi there OMAD people.

In hopes of keeping up the good spirit and reaching my goal I am going to do a weekly report, showing my progress (or stagnation) with OMAD.

My main goal with OMAD is loosing some weight, an to remove the temptation of candy, junk food and sodas throughout the day, due to the simplicity of only eating once per day. Getting rid of my sugar addiction will surely be a wonderful thing!  
Other than that I stick to only water and black coffee both while fasting and during my meal.  
I am choosing not to calorie count, but most days I will just eat a large, homecooked meal with my wife and kids. As I am the one who does most of the cooking at home, I have made sure to increase the size of our dinner Meal a little, to make up for the fact that I now eat a bit more at dinnertime than I used to. Probably about once a week, we order takeout, and I assume that will not be a problem either.

**Overall Stats:**  
**Gender:** Male  
**Starting weight:** 110,0 kg  
**Current weight as of this morning:** 101,6 kg  
**Height:** 193 cm  
**Goal:** 90 kg  
**Weeks on OMAD:** 4

**Week 3:**  
**Starting weight:** 103,7 kg  
**End weight:** 101,6 kg  
**Weight loss week 5:**  2,1 KG

**Monday:** 103,7 kg   
**Tuesday:** 102,9 kg - 40 minutes of cardio  
**Wednesday:** 102,7 kg   
**Thursday:** 102,1 kg  
**Friday:** 101,2 kg - - 40 minutes of cardio  
**Saturday:** 101,8 kg  
**Sunday:** 102,1 kg  
**Monday:** 101,6 kg

As expected this week lost quite a lot of weight, after gaining 1 kg last week due to my full weekend of drinking and eating. Though I would gladly do it again.

Happy to be back on track and loosing weight. This weekend I had a few thoughts that I thought I better share with you guys:

1) Mental health. I honestly feel that doing OMAD had helped my mental health a lot! I did not have bad mental health beforehand as such, but after starting I feel quite some improvements! The most noticeable one is the fact that I seem to turn to quick dopamine fixes a lot less. Probably because my brain has started to fathom the the fix of sugary foods are not coming either.

2) Physical health! For as long as I can remember I have suffered bdaly from seborrheic dermatitis (super agressive dandruff to those who don't know it). I have had large rashes on my chest, and in the face on my forehead and around my nose. Latest has been a year long outbreak in my hairline. This shit is gone! I have tried more or less every remedy under the sun, from coal tar to ketoconazol to try and get rid of this, but just 5 weeks of OMAD, and no sugar has made it more or less vanish.   
  
So far I am honestly enjoying the side effects of my OMAD, almost more, than the weightloss, which was my initial reason to start OMAD.

Stay safe out there and hail the one meal god!

I already use the Brave browser every day, so when I saw the VPN option built right in, I figured why not try it? I was working from a coffee shop and wanted something quick just to feel safer on public Wi-Fi. It’s not a free VPN, which kinda sucks, but the idea of having it all in one app was nice. The setup was super simple—literally just a toggle in the browser. I tested it by switching locations and checking my IP, and it worked fine. Speeds were decent too, not crazy fast but definitely better than most free VPN options I’ve tried like TunnelBear or the free version of Proton. What I don’t love is that it only covers the browser traffic unless you upgrade to the full device-level VPN, which is more money. I’ve seen people ask about Brave VPN on free VPN Reddit threads, and honestly, if you already use Brave and just want light protection while browsing, it’s not a bad deal. But if you’re looking for the best free VPN Reddit users recommend for full privacy or streaming, there are probably better choices. Curious what others here think—is Brave VPN worth paying for long term or just a nice bonus for casual use?",1,1743410697.0,VPNFreaks,0,1.0,False

1jnym0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1jnym0d/bad_advice_in_good_faith_rant/,Bad advice in good faith (rant),"So I'm pretty suthough. (a chronic insomniac. Every few weeks I'll end up being awake for two or three days against my will. Most of the time we're talking no more than four hours of sleep though. I'm still a fairly high functioning college student, I have good grades, an internship, and a fairly solid friend group. Even then I know how much not being able to sleep is holding me back...

Because once in a blue moon I will wakeup at a normal hour feeling well rested with the motivation to even cook breakfast for myself without first nursing a coffee. I really am a different person when I can get good sleep, everything seems so much easier. I am much more charismatic and outgoing when I've slept, I even remember once talking to a girl before anxiety could even realize what I was upto. School no longer seems so demanding and I make amazing progress on my projects. These are the days I find myself taking care of the smaller annoyances that I'd normally not have the will to bother with, and I end the day feeling accomplished. In my 20 years I've never had two days like this in a row though. (Except that brief time I had a girlfriend)

Inevitably I end up in bed with a good bit of mental energy left in the tank. Physically I'm exhausted, but I can't turn my brain off. Usually I'll think about something I was doing during the day, or something that happened, someone from my past, or a hard to solve problem from work. I can shut my eyes as much as I like, and no amount of breathing can tell my brain to shut up. Sometimes I'll pop a trazadone in desperation, but I only feel that when I inevitably get up to pee and can barely balance. I know whatever my problem is is genetic because my mom is the same way, only she gets ambien to help her sleep, I get lectured about sleep hygiene by whatever physician I bring this up to. 

""Have you tried melatonin?"" Is a phrase I've heard so many times from well meaning friends and dismissive doctors. Other times I'll hear ""no electronics an hour before bed,"" ""read right before you go to bed"" only I can't spare an hour of daylight between work and school and whatever I read ends up being whatever I ruminate over more often than not. I know it's hard for some people without insomnia to understand, but its so frustrating hearing it so many times.

 I haven't bothered going to a doc about this in about a year, last one prescribed trazadone which doesn't do shit, and insurance left me holding a $400 bag. I want to go on ambien or one of the other extra strength sleep drugs, but any quack I go to just tells me to practice better sleep hygiene. Its insulting and I think it's because I'm young, they think I'm just immature and undisciplined, so they hand waive away the possibility that I have an actual sleep issue. I know I can't go to a sleep clinic, the one near me charges just shy of a grand and my insurance will refuse to cover the expense, likely for the same reason I can't get anything with more kick than trazadone. 

I get those small glimpses of who I could be if I could sleep, and it's so demoralizing to end the day knowing I'll wake up feeling like shit again. I can't really confide in friends, they offer half assed advice or just look at me like I'm insane. Things really would be so much easier if I could just sleep, but instead of sleeping I'm typing this ahead of another week of tiredness. ",1,1743410499.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

I don’t feel sluggish after eating 

I put on weight which is great to me as I have struggled with maintaining healthy weight for most of my life 

My skin/face looks more full

I don’t really know when I’m thirsty except for in the morning or until I realise I’m pretty dehydrated by the end of the day 

Increased mental clarity 

Sometimes makes me crave sugar 

Weird slimy feeling in my mouth when I wake up 
(I don’t know if this is normal or eventually goes away)

Takes me longer to fall asleep at night even though I get lots of sun during the day and live in a warmer environment 

.I wake up earlier

.Sometimes I will get stomach cramps

.i Don’t feel full till at least an hour after eating which can cause me to over eat sometimes 

Some questions I have are 
.i cant get access to raw dairy or unsalted dairy can I make my own culture by .eg spitting in a bottle of goat kefir and leaving at room temperature?

.can I eat pasteurised organic unsalted butter?

Why dose any salt make me feel like sht.?
What should I do for electrolytes?

.is lots of olive oil with my meat meals okay?

.When do I drink water?

.Can I have cold brew light coffee?

.Why do raw tomatoes/juice and celery juice make me feel so good? (I have tried these both recently)

.are store bought free range (organic eggs okay?)

.can I still drink meat/chicken stocks? These have helped me in the past 

.how do I make this work socially? (I live a pretty social lifestyle and have to hide this way I eat from 
Friends and family which can make me feel very outcasted at times can I still get these benefits if I slightly sear meat and leave inside raw for eg. if I go out to eat somewhere will a seared/very rare/blue rare steak still give me the benefits to this diet?

.Dose anyone else live socially while following this way of eating? if so how do you make it work 

.can I still eat coconut oil?

.Can I still brush my teeth/oil pulling with coconut oil

.Can I or/should I be adding spices? Like mustard ect which are recommend by Aajonus 

.when should I open-close my eating window I am never hungry for at least a few hours after waking up and I also don’t like to eat during/or close to night time

.is it okay to freeze my grass fed ground beef/or lamb/organs that I buy from a butchers

.Any other things I should incorporate?
I am pretty sensitive to high fiber or high sugar /starch I also have allergy’s to latex fruits such as bananas and avocados and pineapples 

Apologies for the amount of questions I want to pursue the benefits and heal myself from a life of poor nutrition through this way of eating if there is anyone who can give me advice would be much appreciated 🙏🙏

1jnyhqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yorkies/comments/1jnyhqv/need_some_advice_on_tako_the_yorkie/,Need some advice on Tako the Yorkie :),"My boyfriend and I have a rescue Yorkie mix around 1 year and 6 months. He's been doing great and we love him a lot!

We do ‘’struggle’’ with one thing. Everytime we leave the house he will bark and cry (even if we give him treats wrapped in a blanket so he gets distracted). After max. 5 minutes he will sleep and can be alone for hours, which is great and we’re happy about it. So my conclusion it’s not separation anxiety. Btw we have a camera that’s why we know he’s calm the rest of the time we’re gone. And he’s never longer than 5 hours alone each time we leave.

Oh and for example when we’re going to get coffee or lunch somewhere and I go to the toilet or order food he also barks and look for me.. even when he still sees me. If my boyfriend leaves to order he doesn’t really bark.

So we’re wondering what the reason is. Because he can be alone, but does bark for the first few minutes. We really want to work on this. Any tips or anyone who experience the same thing?

In general he’s a very good dog. Potty trained, can walk off-leash, has a few dog friends, over all house trained.

1jnygna,https://www.reddit.com/r/astrologymemes/comments/1jnygna/my_assumptions_of_every_sign/,My assumptions of every sign,"Dunno what flair to give this hope I chose right, Anyway don’t take offense to any of these, everything here is all for shits and giggles 

Aries-Loud with a capital L, whether you decide to see that as an insult or compliment I leave that up to you, it’s best to have a handful of friends with the same signs but trust me 1 aries friend goes a looong way, if these guys were in a band they’d play drums (cuz it’s LOUD) 

Taurus-Chill af, never causing drama for anyone, immaculate taste in music (trust all song recs given to you by a Taurus) also my favorite of the Earth signs but for the love of God can you please try new foods? I don’t wanna be stuck eating fast food for the rest of my life 😭 

Gemini-Certified yappers these mfs talk by defaults, even if they’re introverted they’ll find one close friend and then talk forever. nothing is off the table here, they can talk about the weather and your favorite colors but then also delve into you deepest insecurities and baggage and yes they’re all tired of the “WORST SIGN” stereotype 

Cancer-You guys highkey scare me, because one minute it’s sweet talking next thing you know I hear about the time you insulted someone’s whole bloodline and then committed arson. I’m scared of y’all but at the same time Ik you have a fucked up sleep schedule so you couldn’t chase me down if you tried

Leo-Cool as fuck, you know that stereotypical cool and popular kid in all those movies/shows? That’s it, that’s them, there’s a reason they gravitate towards the spotlight. Again this applies even if they’re introverted, the vibes are all there so if you’re bored go to them because they know all sorts of fun activities to keep you occupied 

Virgo-Ok I’m going out on a limb here and saying that you work in some social service field or something Education related. You guys have nice voices and are meticulous it’s insane, may come off as too nitpicky sometimes but honestly I get it 

Libra-I seriously don’t get the hate for this sign, (I notice a lot of hate on this subreddit for Libras) Libras I feel are the signs that were never told “I love you” enough so if you know a Libra please tell em that. They’re also huge coffee enthusiasts so gift them some coffee beans for Christmas idk

Scorpio-Not at all evil unlike what all the stereotypes will tell ya. They’re emotional like the other water signs but they express it in different ways. I think they’re the embodiment of that “looks like they could kill you, is a cinnamon roll” meme, they’re also funny af (just don’t expect all their jokes to all be pc) 

Sagittarius-Definitely the sign with multiple friend groups. They’re also the type to binge watch Twilight and read those spicy novels, now that’s probably a better assumption for Scorpio but I say the two signs are pretty damn similar to each other so honestly I feel like I could swap these two’s descriptions 

Capricorn-Boring, I’m so sorry I know you guys don’t mean to appear boring I’m sure you guys have something interesting going on it’s just I never see it 😭. On the brightside, you guys are amazing at working, always on that grind and I can respect that 

Aquarius-Yeah the “weird” stereotype is 100% accurate, they’re always into the most niche, obscure thing that only like 8 people know about or have a hobby that you’ve most certainly never heard of and yknow what that’s fine, they’re on another level and we just have to live with that

Pisces-Ok so I firmly believe that all Earth and Water signs have fucked up sleep schedules but Pisces is on another level, I see you there awake at 4 am when you have to work in 5 hours, I also firmly believe Pisces are squishy and very huggable so that’s a plus",0,1743409775.0,astrologymemes,1,0.5,False

They want us to be working full time, pay half for everything, and still do the cooling and cleaning on top of it. My older relatives didn't have to pay for anything and got allowances, and stayed home as the house wife. There's this shame that's going on where girl bosses say it's ""abusive"" and ""stupid"" to be a house wife ... but how is it empowering to be working, paying half, and still doing it (or a good portion of it)? If I wanted halfsies, that's what you get platonic roomates for. People argue a partnership should be splitting things, but i have never known anyone (or personally found) anything where it is a true partnership. Someone is always doing way too much atop paying for so much. 

But for context, I cannot find a decent paying job. The jobs I did have treated me poorly, and I often got harassed and no one cared about my safety. I could try to become a teacher or nurse, but many of my friends have and they are immensely overworked and have burned out. 

I currently do ebay at home and help with a little of the bills, but my SO pays the bulk of everything. I run errands, coupon for items we use, cook, clean, and meal prep for him. Personally, I'm a lot happier at home and I do enjoy cooking and keeping a clean and organized home. The meal prep and couponing has saved us a ton of money too. I enjoy ebay a lot and spend free time working out and doing my other hobbies. 

I think for certain households, having one partner be more of the housewife can seriously be more valuable than having a halfsie relationship where you both work and split stuff, especially if you're like me and cannot find a decent job. We don't have kids, but daycare is expensive and would pretty much eat up majority of my paycheck. This is a really bad school district, so we would need to move or home school. 

When I worked full time, I was so stressed and exhausted trying to do everything on weekends especially at crowded stores running errands. I struggled to meal prep and we struggled to keep up with cleaning. We spent so much getting fast food and coffees when we both worked. My so and I are both happier this way.
