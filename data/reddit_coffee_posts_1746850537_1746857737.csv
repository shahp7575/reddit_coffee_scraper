i feel like im being tortured alive & theres no way out. ive tried so many different medications & nothing works. i just want a break, at least one day out of the week to feel normal, have a cup of coffee & leave my house to talk with people. even before i got sick i used to just hide away, work overnight jobs & abuse drugs & self isolate.

maybe it was the drugs that caused it, now im seeing a therapist who says its trauma that is causing it but it just doesn’t make sense considering the onset of the symptoms after a severe immune response & ever since that night my body doesnt feel like mine anymore. you would think after 4 years u would get used to it but u dont.

i want to disappear. sometimes i think i died & this past 4 years have been a sort of purgatory or parallel universe. ive had bad overdoses & close calls where i almost got into car accidents & think maybe i did die & im in my judgement place or purgatory or whatever & im trying to redeem myself or getting tested by God maybe. this is just me theorizing im not insane, im still very grounded but just desperate for answers & open to anything.

im scared to tell my therapist a lot of this because i will jusy get baker act, they dont care to help me.
im still somewhat young, under 30, but feel like my 20s are being robbed from me. 

the small amount of friends i still do have rarely talk to me anymore cause they probably think i am the crazy hypochondriac friend who lost his mind (which is honestly understandable, i would feel the same way) that & i can barely leave the house so i talk to them occasionally on discord

i miss some of my old friends from school & even rehab. someone to be vulnerable with, cry, talk to, hell just even be in the room with me. this isolation really is the cherry on top to feeling horrible.

i hate my body, i hate this situation, i hate that the doctors can’t figure it out, i hate that people think its all in my head. thanks if anyone even read this shit, and if anyone has any advice cuz i have nothing left i lost everything.",1,1746857536.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1kj3icb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kj3icb,I Spent 8 Months Rewriting Jubensha for the U.S.—Here’s What I’ve Made,"After 8 months of losing sleep, drinking too much coffee, and rewriting the same paragraph fifty times, I can finally say this: I’ve made an English version of *Jubensha* that I think Americans are actually going to love.

It runs for 2.5 hours—like a movie, but with more drama, fewer explosions, and a lot more arguing over who the killer is.

What makes it different?

* Way more player interaction, way less reading like you're prepping for a school play.
* Smooth, natural English—no awkward phrasing or Google Translate energy.
* Fully localized to feel like something made *for* an English-speaking audience, not just translated.

This month, *Usher’s Nightmare Tale* and *The Dragon Slayer* are officially launching across the West Coast—Bay Area, Los Angeles, and San Diego.

The website’s coming soon. For now, I’m just excited (and mildly sleep-deprived) to finally put this out into the world.",1,1746857480.0,jubensha,1,1.0,False

I just finished my laundry and cleaning early — nothing beats starting the weekend with a clear space and a clear mind. I love using Saturdays to declutter, restock groceries, maybe grab a coffee or take a solo stroll, then ease into a quiet, cozy Sunday for full relaxation.

It’s become my little self-care ritual.

So I’m curious — what’s your ideal weekend plan? Are you all about productivity, adventure, or full recharge mode? What helps you feel grounded before the week starts again?

1kj3e9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1kj3e9i/how_do_you_guys_experience_the_nifi_loop/,How do you guys experience the Ni-Fi loop,"Interested to hear if your experience is anything similar to what I’m describing below. I’ve come to an interesting observation—the first few times in the loop were completely unconscious, but going back, the pattern has been the same every time.

Analysing such periods of my personal experience—the perpetrator appears to actually be Te—the most stubborn bastard there is, I swear (Ti-doms can say they’re stubbornness personified, and I'd let them “win” the argument every time rather than waste precious time, but they have no clue about the Te-ride once Ni or Fi decides that the effort is worth it on the personal scale). 

So, Te up and goes in some sort of existential crisis (likely after something absolutely illogical/uncontrollable/unstrategizeable occurred), that no amount of logic can alleviate. It digs its heels stubbornly in the ground, saying “You guys fix it by yourselves for once”—rather than Ni-Fi taking the rains on their own accord.

If I continue with the metaphor; Ni and Fi decide they split the load, and rotate each morning—they wake up, make coffee for themselves and then for Te, and start trying to get it out of its hibernation. Ni senses it’s a pointless endeavor because it is not yet time, but still tries to manipulate Te with grand visions of the distant future. It doesn’t really work. Fi tries to appeal to Te with valorous promises how grand its return to form would be once it awakens. It really really doesn’t work.

After multiple attempts, Ni and Fi—having their third coffee and in a random conversation—stumble upon a rabbit hole they really *want* to explore, doesn’t matter that it lacks any clarity of purpose or direct implementation. They say ef it, and several insomnia-induced \[insert days/weeks/months\] later, Ni and Fi are still making sure Te stays hydrated, but have thrown any attempts to shake it out of its slumber out the window, binging on said rabbit hole.

Meanwhile, Se is laughing at them all, and on the occasion it gets bored/annoyed, it gets them drunk in order to at least get them to sleep.

Te only rises from its hibernation if someone else’s Se or Ne drags it out and leaves it no other options.

For the last few months I’ve essentially had a headache the never goes away. It’s a tingling and pulsating sensation localized to the left side of my face. It traces from cheek/under eye area all the way to left temple area

I’ve gotten bloodwork done and everything is within normal ranges yet this headache seems to come with low energy and disrupts cognitive function. 

The severity varies. On days when it’s less apparent, I visibly look younger and more vibrant. While other days I look completely depleted and could sleep all day. Sounds crazy I know. But even my partner has commented on the visible fluctuations in my appearance. I also notice my nervous system seems to be overly active despite no external stressors. 

I have a healthy lifestyle, no smoking or alcohol and am active every day. I have become hypersensitive to supplements and even my morning coffee. 

When I’m on a ketogenic diet it improves significantly. 

A few symptoms that made me think structural blockage were - vascularity in the left side of my face is very apparent in comparison to the right side. Also localized hyper pigmentation on the left side as well with none on the right side, I also have a burst blood vessel under my left eye that has been there for about a year or 2. 

Finally I went to an Osteopath and he showed me how the various muscles on the left side of  my mouth were severely tied up in knots compared to the right. He mentioned he sees some wear on my teeth and thinks bruxism is the root of this problem. About 20 years ago I had a dentist tell me I grind my teeth at night but I thought I had stopped. my partner confirms she never sees or hears me doing so in my sleep. The osteopathic treatments have helped temporarily but after a few days the headache returns.

I have had very mild success in with gua sha scraping to relieve some symptoms. Previous dental history is good. When I was about 13 years old I had a coating put on my teeth. And until 1.5 years ago I had never had a filling. 2 small ones were put in at that time. 

I’m at my wits end trying to get to the bottom of this. Have documented all my symptoms and daily updates into AI. Everytime I think I have solved the issue it shows to only be a temporary bandaid. It’s another month before I can get into the dentist so I’m debating if I should get an MRI before that. Any insight would be appreciated. Thank you. ",1,1746856865.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

And not just any manager the most toxic person I’ve ever encountered. I’m not sure what’s going on with her, her husband, or the planets, but she seems to bring all her personal frustration to work and unload it on our team like it’s a therapy session.

The real thrill? Her mood swings.
It’s like working with a human stock market you never know when it’s going to crash. Sometimes she’s all smiles and motivation, and the next moment you’re wondering if you accidentally triggered World War 3 by saying “Good morning.”

Every single day, I feel like quitting. But then the salary hits my account, and I think, “Ek aur din sahi.”

INT. DESTINY – CONTROL INTERFACE ROOM



Lights flicker across consoles. The hum of the ship is distant but present. The crew stands in tense silence as the Stargate powers up for the first time in months.



GREER (tense)

That's not us. The gate just... activated.



RUSH (stepping forward)

No incoming wormhole from any system we’ve scouted.



CHLOE (softly)

It's Earth.



BRODY

What?! That’s impossible. We’re still five hundred years out of sync.



VOLKER

Unless they’ve been trying to reach us all this time... and finally figured it out.



The Stargate stabilizes. A voice comes through, garbled at first, then clearer. It’s not a person they know — it’s younger, confident, and calm.



EARTH VOICE (V.O.)

...Destiny. This is the Earth Gatebridge Network Command. Resupply in progress. Please stand by.



YOUNG (staring at the wormhole)

We’ve got a connection.



CUT TO: INT. GATE ROOM — SHORT MONTAGE



Sealed containers begin arriving. Some are marked clearly: “FOOD – HYDROPONIC.” Others are labeled with unfamiliar logos and strange glyphs. A few are unmarked entirely.



Clothing bundles. Water purification systems. A crate that hums faintly with latent power. Weapons — sleek, modular, and unreadable. The crew works quickly to unload, confused, overwhelmed, amazed.



The mood is surreal. Some crew members are smiling. Others are frozen. Hope has returned — too suddenly.



RUSH (off to the side, scanning a container with a pad)

They’ve sent us things we can’t even identify. It’s like they tried to give us everything... and nothing makes sense yet.



YOUNG

Prioritize food and anything we can adapt now. I want a full inventory started. And— (beat) keep eyes on that gate.



Suddenly, Destiny’s lights flicker. A low harmonic tone rumbles under the floor.



THETA (V.O., monotone)

Course correction initiated.



BRODY

What the hell?



EXT. SPACE – DESTINY



The ship’s engines flare to life. The Stargate shuts down mid-transfer. A crate is caught halfway — sliced by the wormhole just before collapse.



INT. GATE ROOM



CHLOE

She’s jumping... Theta’s taking us into FTL.



YOUNG (furious)

Why now?!



Cut to black.



ACT 1

INT. DESTINY – GATEROOM



YOUNG slams a hand on the control panel. Everyone around him is frozen — the wormhole’s gone, the supplies are half-unpacked.



YOUNG

We had contact. We had a line back home.



RUSH (quietly)

And Theta decided we didn’t need it.



ELI (arriving fast)

I was running diagnostics — she rerouted core power to the FTL drive before the gate even shut down. It was deliberate.



BRODY

Deliberate or... reactive? Could she have detected something we didn’t?



ILINAR (off-panel)

No.



Everyone turns. ILINAR enters from an upper corridor. He looks calm, almost too calm — his tone carries weight.



ILINAR (cont’d)

Theta saw no threat. She responded to something else. A trajectory embedded in her core directives.



VOLKER

So this is another override?



ILINAR

No. She believed she was following purpose.



YOUNG

How do you know that?



ILINAR (pauses, eyes flicker with remembered memory)

Because I helped design that directive.



Beat of silence. The crew exchanges glances. They know Ilinar built Destiny before he ascended. He is slowly recalling more.



RUSH (stepping toward him)

And what is that purpose?



ILINAR (cryptic)

That... is still coming back to me.



INT. DESTINY – MESS HALL



The crew gathers. Food has been distributed. New clothing and strange devices are laid out on tables. Laughter and lightness return — temporarily.



CHLOE (to Eli)

Do you think they knew we were alive this whole time?



ELI

I think they hoped.



VOLKER

These weapons... we don’t even know how to activate them.



BRODY

We’ll figure it out. Eventually. It’s like being handed an alien Swiss Army knife with the instructions in Ancient-Kanji.



GREER (testing one of the modular rifle-like objects)

We’ll figure it out faster if we don’t blow our faces off.



ILINAR (softly, from across the table)

Some of it I remember. The energy systems, the interface harmonics. Give me time.



CHLOE (looks at him)

It’s coming back to you, isn’t it?



ILINAR (nods)

Piece by piece. Like walking through your childhood home with all the furniture missing.



YOUNG (arriving late, focused)

We’re not done. We just lost the line to Earth and we don’t know if it’s coming back. From this moment forward, we work in shifts to decode what they sent us. Start with food, water systems, and anything we can weaponize if we have to.



RUSH

And what about Theta?



YOUNG (grim)

We talk later. Right now, we learn everything we can.



ACT 3



EXT. SPACE – DESTINY SKIMMING A SUN



Destiny rides the edge of a brilliant stellar corona. Solar plasma flows across its energy collectors, the hull groaning faintly as intense radiation is converted into raw power.



INT. DESTINY – ENGINEERING



Lights are still inconsistent. Power flickers in certain sections. Brody, Volker, and Eli work over exposed conduits, tools and parts scattered.



BRODY

We’re not back to full strength, but this is the best shape Destiny's been in since before we went into stasis.



VOLKER

And that was centuries ago — for Earth, anyway.



ELI

We’ve still got degraded power regulators. Storage capacity’s shot. But we’ve got enough juice now to start real repairs.



RUSH (entering, holding a pad)

Shields first. If we’re going to move through more of this ship or face anything else out there, we need to re-establish our defensive lattice.



BRODY

Already patching it. We can stabilize the primary emitters with the reserves from the star. Might even be able to restore the forward shield.



ELI

Theta planned this stop. It routed us past the sun. It knew what we’d need.



RUSH

It always knows just a little more than we do.



INT. DESTINY – SHIELD CONTROL ROOM



Ilinar is quietly working at a console—damaged but still partially responsive. He carefully inserts a crystal etched with Ancient markings.



ILINAR (quietly)

I designed this interface… We calibrated it for solar refueling cycles.



As the glyphs ignite, schematics scroll rapidly.



ILINAR

It’s not all gone. My mind’s... catching up. I remember what it felt like to be part of this. To build it.



He glances around, more confident now.



ILINAR

I’m not ascended anymore. But I can still help.



INT. DESTINY – MESS AREA



The crew is gathered. A new crate has been pried open—clothing, sealed rations, unfamiliar tools, and tech scattered across the tables.



CHLOE

Some of this is so advanced we don’t even know what it does.



YOUNG

That makes it dangerous. But we’ll take what we can get. We’ve been surviving on ingenuity.



GREER (holding a sleek weapon-like device)

Let’s hope this thing’s on our side.



INT. DESTINY – BRIDGE



The bridge glows with pale gold from solar collection. Theta is silent now—no projections, no voice.



RUSH (scanning logs)

Long-range stellar navigation shows Theta’s been tracking this sun for... decades. This wasn’t a detour. It’s part of something larger.



ELI

You think it knew we’d need this exact moment?



RUSH

No. I think it’s guiding us toward something we’re not ready to understand.



EXT. SPACE – THE OBSERVER SHIP WATCHES FROM AFAR



Now visible as Destiny slows at the edge of the star system—a dark, ethereal shape remains just out of range. It does not act. It watches.



INT. DESTINY – OBSERVATION DECK



Greer, Chloe, and Young look out. A soft, slow hum resonates in the ship as systems stabilize just enough.



CHLOE

We’re not alone anymore. And I don’t mean Earth.



YOUNG

As long as we’re moving forward, we’re still in the fight.



GREER

Let’s just hope this time, the ship’s on our side.



Cut to the slow glow of reactivating shields, energy pulsing through the hull.



FADE OUT.



ACT 4

INT. DESTINY – CONTROL ROOM



Lights remain dim but steadier. Core systems are damaged but stabilizing. Repair crews rotate through stations. There’s tension — progress, but slow and uncertain.



Eli works through a tangled diagnostic display. Volker is nearby with a schematic pulled up on a secondary screen.



Eli

(sighs)

Shields are holding for now. With the power from the refueling, we can push repairs a bit further — maybe even bring auxiliary sensors back online.



Volker

Yeah, but the power reserves aren’t infinite. This is still patchwork. If we hit anything serious again...



Eli

We’ll improvise. Like always.



Ilinar enters, reviewing data on a tablet. His tone is quieter, more observational than speculative.



Ilinar

The systems are... adjusting. More quickly than they should. Core routines are adapting around the damage, prioritizing unfamiliar protocols.



Eli

(wary)

So, what — the ship’s repairing itself?



Ilinar

Not exactly. It’s not healing — it's... learning. Responding faster. Like it’s evolving to meet current needs.



Volker

That’s not exactly comforting.



Ilinar

It might be the opposite. If it’s adapting to us, we need to keep up. Or get out of its way.



INT. DESTINY – STORAGE ROOM



The crew is organizing the last of the Earth-sent supplies. Crates are open, revealing practical necessities and unexplained devices. The mood is mixed: relief, awe, and frustration.



Brody

(holding up a sealed pack of clothes)

Finally. No more patching socks with wire insulation.



Greer

(chuckling)

Speak for yourself. I made that look good.



Volker

(examining a sleek, glowing device)

We got tech here I can’t even describe, let alone power on.



Chloe

Some of this might be for systems we don’t even use anymore.



Young

Catalog it. Everything. We’ll figure it out piece by piece.



He moves to the next crate, opens it — strange tools and compact weapon systems, clearly far beyond their current understanding.



INT. DESTINY – ENGINEERING BAY



Eli and Ilinar work in tandem on shield calibrations. Sparks flash as panels are reconnected. The hull’s inner vibration feels steadier now.



Eli

Shields are climbing — 42% and stable. Still not battle-ready, but we could take a few hits.



Ilinar

Better than before. We can start reaching sealed sections again. A full deck survey might even be possible soon.



Eli

And what then? We unlock more broken doors, find another AI in a wall?



Ilinar

If the ship’s opening up, it wants us to see. That’s not nothing.



Eli

(half-smiles)

You’re sounding a lot more like Rush every day.



Ilinar

I remember enough of him to know when not to go that far.



INT. DESTINY – BREAK ROOM



Crew sits quietly, eating real food for the first time in a long while. Coffee steams. Laughter bubbles up in short bursts, the tension softening.



Chloe

(holding a mug, smiling faintly)

I forgot what this even tasted like.



Brody

I forgot what hope tasted like.



Young

Enjoy it. Who knows how long it’ll last.



A beat. They all know he’s right, but no one wants to say it out loud.



INT. DESTINY – OUTER CORRIDORS



Theta remains silent. Consoles glow faintly with unfamiliar icons. As the crew walks by, some systems seem to pulse in sync with their movement — subtle, nearly imperceptible.



Chloe

(quietly, to Young)

The ship’s different now. Feels different.



Young

It’s still Theta running things. But yeah. It’s... changing. So are we.



END OF ACT 4



ACT 5

INT. DESTINY – MESS HALL – NIGHT



Dim lights. Low murmur of voices. The crew shares a rare, quiet meal. Real food from the Earth resupply. New clothes. Steam rising from hot mugs. Laughter tries to return.



GREER

(grinning)

I don’t care where it came from. Tastes like home.



CHLOE

(softly, holding a cup, distant)

It’s not just the food. Everything’s… different. Like the air feels thicker somehow.



ELI

(nods)

Pressure stabilized a little. Still a long way from comfortable, but Theta’s rebalanced the systems just enough to move the needle.



RUSH enters, weathered and focused, reading a datapad.



RUSH

Life support’s holding. Just. Shields are next. We finally have enough stored charge to begin work on the mid-deck emitters. Assuming no new surprises.



VOLKER

(sarcastic)

No surprises? On this ship?



They share a quiet laugh — the first honest one in days.



INT. DESTINY – STASIS POD BAY – LATER



Brody and Volker stand near Emissary 9, now secured and isolated in a sealed alcove. Ilinar joins them, arms folded, calm but alert.



BRODY

We still can’t access the interior. It’s sealed tighter than the core vaults.



VOLKER

No seams. No power signature. Not even a surface molecular structure I recognize.



ILINAR

(staring at it)

It’s not just advanced. It’s different. As if it wasn’t made… only grown.



BRODY

(skeptical)

What does that even mean?



ILINAR

Something about it feels familiar. Not from memory — from rhythm. Form. As though I should know it, but the language is just out of reach.



VOLKER

We’re gonna need more than rhythm to crack this thing.



The camera lingers on Emissary 9 — silent, unmoving, unreadable.



INT. DESTINY – ENGINEERING HUB



New crates sit half-unopened. Some tech glows faintly, its purpose unclear. Eli scans something with a hand-held interface, confused and amazed.



ELI

(to himself)

We asked for parts. They sent… puzzles.



He glances to a half-disassembled shield conduit.



ELI (CONT'D)

One thing at a time.



He plugs in a circuit enhancer. Sparks fly. The hum deepens.



RUSH (O.S.)

Careful. That’s not calibrated for this system.



Rush walks in, watching closely.



ELI

I know. But I think I can coax it to stabilize the shield grid. Temporarily.



RUSH

(quiet, impressed)

Then coax away.



INT. DESTINY – CORRIDORS



Chloe walks alone. The halls are dim, pulsing faintly with residual power. The hum of FTL subtly deepens. She pauses near an interface panel that flickers to life as she approaches — uncommanded.



She doesn’t touch it. Just watches.



CHLOE

(quietly)

You're listening, aren’t you.



The panel dims again. She moves on.



INT. DESTINY – OBSERVATION DECK



Greer, Young, and Ilinar stand in the dark, gazing at the tunnel of stars stretching ahead in FTL. No words. Just the vast, endless journey ahead.



YOUNG

We’ve been alone a long time.

(pauses)

I’m starting to wonder if we ever weren’t.



ILINAR

(softly)

The ship is not what it was. And neither are we.



GREER

So what now?



ILINAR

Now… we begin to understand.



INT. DESTINY – SHIELD CONTROL ROOM – LATER



Eli, Rush, and Brody work in near silence, fingers moving across consoles. Sparks. Systems flicker. The shield grid is partially restoring. It's fragile — but it’s working.



The ship feels just a little more alive.



INT. DESTINY – EMISSARY 9 CHAMBER – FINAL SCENE



Ilinar returns alone. Emissary 9 sits in the quiet chamber. He steps close.



ILINAR

(whispers)

You're not done yet, are you?



No response. Just silence. The faint glow inside the device pulses once — barely visible.

1kj36cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FathersJourney/comments/1kj36cq/my_lunch_with_blanche/,My lunch with Blanche,"*Dotty and I spent a couple of hours in the gazebo tonight talking through my day.  I told her everything that happened, everything that was said.  She’s a strong woman, Dot, but she’s careful.  I wish she weren’t so careful right now – I wish she would provoke me, but it’s complicated.  For now, I’ll just type out the words in my head because that’s how my mind works and it's what I need to do.  I’ll revert to the very charter of this sub by rambling without pause and I’ll give it to you.  And when I’m done, I know I’ll feel better.*   

It was a weird day.

I haven’t spoken of my mother-in-law (the Pelican) for quite a long time and that’s largely because of the separation I applied after the worst of it.  Many here will recall the hell she and her daughter put us through after Suzie died; the pilfering, the lies.  How they sought to divide me from my sons. 

Well, I should confess that it hasn’t been complete radio silence.  In fact, I reach out once a month with an email of updates on the boys.  Anymore, if they reply at all, it’s down to a simple “thank you.”

I don’t know, maybe I think too much.  But I’ve said from the very start that I want so badly for my sons to have their family.  And I want their family to have my sons.

I sent pictures of PJ at the event, when he won the writing contest, though I didn’t share his entry.  Days later, my mother-in-law would reply, not with a simple thank you, but with pages of regret and longing – it was a lot to read and it was unexpected and it was raw.

I read her words, though not stoically.  I read them with the ten thousand memories that I’ve kept all the while.  I wasn’t presuming her tone; I’ve learned not to do that.  Instead, I simply listened to what she said. 

It was a long time between hitting reply and typing.  I had a lot of thoughts.  Then, finally, I wrote, “Will you have lunch with me?”

Some here might cringe at that, and I understand.  After all, I brought you through the nightmare with me then, as it happened, while I was slow to learn.  Some may recall my melt-down and the night of broken dishes.  There isn’t much love for the in-laws here and I know that.  But what has stayed with me all along is the fact that they are a part of her; a part of my sons.  And that has to matter.

This was not an easy decision.

I was intentionally late for our reservation, going so far as to drive a few exits past the restaurant.  It wasn’t a power-play, I don’t subscribe to that sort of thing.  I don’t know why I did it.

She had her back to me when I stepped up to the table.  It was a weird moment.  She was a stranger to me.

“Hello, Blanche.”

My voice seemed to startle her as she turned.  When she looked up at me, there was an odd expression of surprise, as if she didn’t expect me to show.  Immediately, she wept, and then clumsily stood to hug me.   “It’s you!”  She said.

After our brief embrace, I took the chair across from her and settled.  And I realized, looking at her, that I didn’t know who to be.  A maelstrom of memories flooded through me then, all mixed together – the good and the bad – I couldn’t peel them apart. You see, I knew the trouble was that I still love this woman.

But Blanche is a game-player – she can’t help it.  It’s just the way she’s built.

“How’s Deloris?” would be her first question.

I shook my head and smiled. And for just a moment I wondered to the thoughts in her head, before I stopped myself and returned to the here and now.  I wouldn’t go there.  You see, what she mightn’t have expected is that I’ve graduated from the game – I no longer play.  So I let out a chuckle.  “Starting right off, I see.”

She sat back the way an innocent wouldn’t; her posture instantly defensive.  “What do you mean?”

“You know Goddamn well her name is Dorothy.”

She’s known Dot for 15 years.  No… this was a signal.  It was her saying, “*She’s not important to me*.”

So it wasn’t a good start.

Dot was the first gorilla at the table and I knew we needed to talk about her.  Blanche said a great many things in that long and heartfelt email she wrote, but so much of what was real would be tucked in between the lines; where between the lines is generally where you’ll find her.  I knew she was hurt, and I knew she was confused.  I know she feels abandoned and I get it.  And the thing is… her feelings were valid and I wanted to listen.

Though she already knows, I reminded her that I didn’t just run out and remarry.  I told her that it wasn’t about forgetting Suzie and how the day isn’t coming when that would ever be possible.

She nodded, and when she did, I could see a hint of shame.  “It’s been hard… the separation.” She said.  “I don’t feel you anymore.”  She looked right at me then.  “So I don’t know.”

“Would you like me to tell you?” 

Blanche nodded, but in her obvious caution, I knew that she didn’t want to listen to more than she was capable of hearing.  She was fragile.

So for a while we talked about Dot and our marriage.  We talked about why we married, what it was like at the start, how it’s changed.  I reminded her how Dotty loved Suzanne; how close they were and how that plays out every day.  I spoke of the softness she brings and how much the boys need her.  I promised her that she wasn’t a replacement, and how much their mother still lives in us.

Blanche seemed to accept my words when she nodded.  I knew that it was impossibly hard for her when I remarried and until this moment, we hadn't talked about it.  We hadn't talked at all.  “You were a son to me, Mack.” She said, but right away, her face soured as she waived her hand, as if shooing the unpleasant memories.  “And it’s not about the ugliness that went on; it’s much simpler than that.” 

“How so?”

She reminded me that she lost her darling daughter – her treasure.  And then she lost me.

I knew she was fragile, but Blanche will be Blanche, and I’m not the same person I was then.

“That’s bullshit and you know it.” I told her.

I wasn’t biting at the shiny lure this time and it isn’t that I’ve grown cold.  I’m just wiser than before.

I was stern and frank when I reminded her that she didn’t lose me, and that, in fact, she pushed me out of her life.  I reminded her that she destroyed trust, that she stole from my children; manipulated them.  I told her how her march though our house on the day of the funeral, taking everything that wasn’t nailed down made me feel as if I was nobody.  I didn't hold back.

“I wanted everything I could have of her.”

“It wasn’t yours.”

“I just wanted anything that would remind her of her.”

I briefly lost my calm. “So did her sons!”

Some heads turned at my outburst and I was embarrassed.  I didn’t count the beats of silence that followed, but there were many. 

Finally, Blanche would put her hand on my forearm and ask if I would listen.  I told her I would.  And then she talked to me, explained and shared her thinking.

Part of what I do for a living is to separate lies from truth and I’m very good at it.  As Blanche spoke, I believed her.  I believed every word.  For you see, they weren’t pretty, her words, they weren’t in defense and they wouldn’t absolve her.  But they were real.

She loved me from the start and she told me she still does.  But she’s always resented me.  “It started when you were dating,” she explained.  She told me that Suzie fell so hard, so fast and that she wasn’t ready.  Before she knew it, I was taking her daughter away from her.  She would pause for a moment, seemingly ordering her thoughts before she would start again, telling me about her therapist; some woman named Grace, and how she’s been helpful.  This was remarkable if only in the sense that I never expected Blanche to engage in therapy – she was always too stubborn.  As she continued, though, it was clear that she had.

“I’m deeply insecure, Mack,” she said. 

“Aren’t we all?” I asked, if a bit desperate to level the field.  These were, after all, some choppy waters – we’ve never talked this way.

Blanche would go on to speak, if briefly, of her own upbringing, so much of which I already knew, but she would go deeper. Her story humbled me.

She admitted that when Suzie died, one of the first things she remembers hearing from her own voice was, “That son of a bitch!”

I would nod and tell her I knew, only I wasn’t sure how.

“I blamed you.” She admitted.  “Because it wouldn’t have happened if she was home with me.”  Blanche would go on to describe her anger, even if it wasn’t logical.  “I couldn’t help it.”

She told me that she didn’t want me to have anything, only she didn’t really understand why.  She said she was just so angry that she wanted to take her daughter’s life back from me. 

“You took her from home, far away from me.”

I reminded her that the farm was her daughter’s dream, not mine.  “You know that.”

“I know.  But she wouldn’t have done it without you.”

She went on to explain the conflict of loving me at the same time, like a son, how well I cared for her, for the family, how happy I made Suzie and how perfectly I loved her and the boys.  “There was nobody better for her and I knew that.” 

Then, for a long moment she just bounced her head, looked up, then down then over.  “It’s just that it all broke that night.”

“Yes it did.”

“I broke that night.” She said.  Then she looked right at me.  “And you became the enemy.”

She told about a moment that I didn’t remember.  It was in the immediate of the worst night when she wanted to have PJ with her, and that I told her no.  She said it was then that she realized that I was the gatekeeper to her grandsons.  She said she knows now that she didn’t process that well.  “It made it so much worse.”

I couldn’t think of anything to say in response.

It was a long talk, terribly long – we kept ordering coffee just to keep the table.  It’s fading now, the details – I’m exhausted.  But I remember asking her, “What have we learned?”

She didn’t reply, but it would convey through her expression, and that subtle nod she offered me then. 

“I never wanted to keep the boys from you; that was never what I wanted to do.” 

She seemed to understand.  I told her how they were my only priority and that they were confused at a time when they needed clarity and security and how she wasn’t offering that.  “You were manipulating them, and you know that’s true.”

“Yes, I know.” She said.

I didn’t expect that – I didn’t expect her to acknowledge that.  And I’ll never forget what she said next.  She said, “But don’t you see, I’ve lost everything now.  And so I’ll take anything you’ll give me.”

God… that killed me. 

I don’t think it was part of any game – I knew she meant it.  I know she loves them; she misses them.  They miss her.

When this was ugly, the boys were younger and vulnerable and things were less settled.  The bullshit that flew then is gone now – the stupid legal letters and lawsuits over trinkets – it’s over now.  She has no cards now.

Dot looked at me tonight and smiled that tranquil smile she gets in such moments of tension.  “You’re working it out, aren’t you?”  She asked.  I told her I was.  I told her that maybe we could have a family day and that we could go to a park or do something, the way we used to.  I told her that the boys miss them too. I told her that maybe it was time.

I remember posting here about the talk I had with Zach over all of this.  And I remember how stressed they made him.  And when I told him that I would be stepping between him and this family, he didn’t fight me, and how terrifically sad that was.  Normally, Zach would fight.  But they really hurt him.

Warts and all, they do miss them and I know they want it fixed; they want what they had.  Maybe it’s not possible.

It was never bad until it was, but even when it was, the one thing that held true all along was that they dearly cherish the boys and they always will – I know that.  And if you’ve been with me long enough, you’ll remember the theme, and how badly I wanted my sons to have their family.  Yet at the same time, I was correct to lower the curtain on this act of the play and I don’t regret it.  I needed to protect my boys and I did.

But maybe it’s time.

I’ll talk to Zach and I’ll hear him.  And it’s not that I’m discounting PJ, it’s just that PJ will do whatever Zach does, and so I’ll talk to Zach first.  And I’ll ask him to be honest, and he will be.

1. **Lower appetite** \- I thought this was manageable, but it's now at the point that I've lost more weight than I'm comfortable with, and am not eating enough food most days, and drinking more coffee for energy. I'm trying to make up for it with high density food/smoothies but it's not cutting it.
2. As a result of this, my **energy levels** are really low- I'm **exercising less** (dropped from 3 times a week to maybe once). I’m feeling physically drained, and my muscles/joints don't feel great with less exercise.
3. I've started to notice that I'm **taking the meds to wake up in the morning** because I'm so tired, which makes it difficult to eat breakfast and starts me off on the wrong foot.
4. I'm now finding it **difficult to sleep**, because it takes me so long to get started in the morning I'm taking meds later in the day, drinking more coffee and exercising less. 

It's a pretty vicious cycle, and I'm having difficulty working out how to break out of it - especially because unmedicated (or just taking a lower does at this point) I'm pretty hopeless at work, study and life admin in general.

I have never been to this area before and it's not like I can just jump into the job markets. Also it was ridiculoued that ""we will raise our rents at any time"" however they just raised it this year.  My old luxury beautiful studio was just $100 more so I am literally in a nightmare upon hearing the vouchers could end this year or next. I found an agreeable beautiful complex with rents under $1200 and I am applying but I have rent arrears and student loans on my credit score. If only I had worked at a dollar store, croissant cafe or sat dogs in my old place to avoid all this!! As I fear eviction any time next year if the voucher ends. The soul embarssment will never recover.  This woman is scary. My apartment is set at 80 or 90% AMI yet I do not make that? Ands sounds no flexibility to even adjust that if next year the voucher ends and I make less. WHy would I be in an apartment for up to $58,000 income, if I make less? Doesn't make sense the subsidized buildings are even going to get people evicted that need the home. The same building has mostly $600 to $950 or so rents but I am on the top tier? The voucher has been assisting I've had fatigue and lung problems after quitting smoking I could not necessarily work a lot and the clothing selling I tried was supposed to make a lot in 6 months it didn't.  Weird thing is, who do you even ask? My Housing Authority is e-mails and then the telephone hotline was disconnected. It is so much stress and time more than working a job howerver I have been so consumed by stress to even walk around and look for jobs !! Woman who runs the place is scary when I renewed all I heard was ""Did you collect unemployment"" from across the room, no I didn't I didn't make enough last summer and came back with coronavirus. It wasn't even like, good morning! So glad you will be with us for another year. The tone shifted. Building has all these glamorous newspaper articles when they opened but the things I've heard from other people living here are beyond what I can comprehend strange. I was looking into STEHP rental assistance but did not get an answer, I am sure I am not in the same boat of worry as many others, is this how long and is this ""to retain permanent housing"" to prevent homelessness? I was before this. I have seen it up to 2 years or 6 months does anyone know? I am just trying to give myself some leeway for finding a job this building evicts after one month and there have been 3 evictions on my floor the place is scary. My small business used to make $2500 a month like it was nothing years ago to be terrified like this is beyond me, I check my emails every day no one writes.

1kj310g,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1kj310g/hang_in_there/,Hang in There,"A 4 by 5 cubicle room hangs around silently, waiting for someone to claim the place. A flood of sunlight fills the space, I just hope it can brightens my mood.

Placed on the eleventh floor, I can see the bustling world below. Feeling trapped, but too afraid to escape. Fortunately, I have my green friend sitting in the corner. He watches over me everyday as my fingers dance loudly on an old keyboard.

The squeaky chair is the one who keeps complaining if I sit for too long. Nudging me to stand for a while, so I don’t hurt my back. I always pick up a book from this pristine wooden shelves beside my desk whenever I want to relax for a while. For me, reading a book makes me feel as if I’m anywhere but here.

I don’t know why I keep coming back. Maybe it’s this lingering smell of freshly-brewed coffee that makes me rethink my decisions.

This company is part of the reasons why my psychologist can go overseas once in a month. Sometimes, the pressure I get from my boss seems higher than the Mariana Trench. Despite all that, this is a place where I can grow. To learn that there is more to life than just having fun. I guess, I’m willing to live that life.",1,1746855537.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

I just saw a post… about a medication for *idiopathic* hypersomnia… I was once diagnosed with this and CFS and so many other things… here’s my response:","***TL;DR: My Response to a Post About Idiopathic Hypersomnia Medication

I'm frustrated seeing medications marketed for ""idiopathic"" conditions without addressing root causes. As someone misdiagnosed multiple times before discovering I had panhypopituitarism, I understand the struggle of living with unexplained symptoms while doctors prescribe bandaid solutions.

For those suffering: Consider getting specific blood tests (ACTH, Cortisol, TSH, FreeT4) without stimulants beforehand. Low ACTH with low cortisol suggests pituitary issues; normal ACTH with low cortisol indicates potentially deadly adrenal problems.

If testing isn't accessible, practice meditation and self-advocacy. Find supportive people and remove toxic influences. As someone who experienced menopause at 19 due to an undiagnosed condition, I'm committed to advocating for those whose legitimate medical issues are dismissed as psychological. You deserve proper diagnosis and treatment, not just symptom management.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​***


If any of you can still fight, this is what I wanted to comment below for this community, but that company has all comments disabled. For those without answers, likely those on this subreddit, listen in: 

If I could respond to a company like this one, I’d say… “Yeah, and guess what why mine was? Not this but still diagnosed as this… I was put on all of these medications that tried to make it seem like it was a mental health issue… when I repeatedly described that these symptoms felt like NyQuil…

Idiopathic BLANK is still an undiagnosed illness. Idiopathic means an unknown cause. Stop finding bandaid solutions for people who are undiagnosed— especially the CFS community. I was 19 and went through menopause because of panhypopituitarism. I’ve always had it and worsened as I aged after puberty. BE BETTER. Stop promoting things like this and put your research into actually helping this community of people who truly suffer every single day of their lives… do you know what it’s like to not be able to explain to peope why you are sick but feel sick every. single. day? Most people by the time they actually do something about this are too late in their illness or life to dedicate all their limited 5% battery to research and ask the questions and know how to navigate this system or afford do  so. They have no background or energy or ability to realize this is happening and to research and fight with every bit of their being like I did… so much that it tricked people into thinking I was fine because I channeled my energy into these appointments… I had time to research… I am a scholar with research… I am writer. My degrees are in journalism and marketing, but I love to write and have passions to help others. I’ve been held back because of medicines like this... Even with treatment, my life is behind. I am always needed hydrocortisone. Stop promoting idiopathic medicine for bandaid treatment. Even me—diagnosed—and pumped wifh multiples medications to stay alive but question whether it’s worth it. They choose not to try to fix it. Stop being these people. And for communities like CFS? They have it the worst of them all. I don’t care. They live a life in an idiopathic illness ignored and untreated. It’s a sad life. A lonely life. This? This is another medicine that will mess up their hormones more depending on what your adding or blocking. Find a way to fix people with adrenal fatigue from an undiagnosed and hard to diagnose adrenal condition. I was lucky to be in Minnesota for college. I pushed for it at Mayo in Rochester. A special test was required called an ITT. People don’t understand that even epinephrine is needed… we live without this due to no hormone being made for people like me and is not having epinephrine other than EpiPens. We can’t do that daily. BE BETTER. Just be freaking better. These people cant even fight. They’ve lost their automony. They are hoping for a miracle, which is supposed to be you. Find the underlying causes “scientists”. Ask the right questions. Observe people of all ages and then ask yourself if this was your child… with all their hopes and dreams left unfulfilled… how would you feel? Be BETTER.”

For those out there with a partner or anyone who wants you better just as much as your do, I recommend you get a simple morning blood draw to check your ACTH, Cortsol, TSH vs FreeT4 (BOTH), and neuro hormones if possible like dopamine, serotonin (if possible - there are other names), epinephrine, non-epinephrine), no coffee, no stimulants like adderall for 3 days, get the test… sleep. If your acth is low with the cortisol, that’s a sign you may need your pituitary checked like I did (even if they say they have - like me - tell them NO, again! But have an advocate to that so your not blamed or mistreated like I was)… if you have normal ACTH (up to 60) and low cortisol, th is is an adrenal issue and deadly. 

For those out there who can’t do this, meditate. It sounds silly, but listen to your body and mind. Ideas pop in there. Religious or spiritual… or maybe you aren’t either, just try. The sleepier the easier it is to be in that state of complete calm but try to focus on the meditation. Listen to your body. Your toes to your head… listen to every part. Keep doing this. Imagine… like a child would… that you have magical powers and can send bright beautiful light to your body. It sounds silly? And maybe you don’t have to believe it’s the other side, but guess what? Your mind is also very powerful. Do this every day. Slowly… every month… set a goal. Routine should be the first. Even if that’s just making a bed and sitting on top with a blanket. Remove the TV from the room. Guys, I wish I could go back… and just know what I know now. I know I sound like a wild & odd person, but I legitimately care about this community so much that I can’t even come on here because I was you. And I a lot of the time still when I’m not on top of things because I haven’t had time to find someone because life is hard and stress is worse, but listen to me… you can do it. I want to help people like you with my obviously loud voice and willingness to speak up… even if it gets me in so much trouble. This is the worst thing… and I want you all better. It could be so many things, but doctors don’t have time to dive into research much… especially for one patient. You often need to find someone to do that for you. A third party… and it’s dreadful. You deserve the best. And I hope this helps someone out there… I do… I really do. I believe in you. Believe in yourself and know that people in this world are fighting for you. People I will make it my life’s mission to help people undiagnosed like with CFS… I’ve been there and been so alone. No one here for me. Parents that didn’t believe me. I was going through menopause, hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, menopause (terrible night sweats, hot flashes, etc), and so much more. I care. I’ve been there and care and still care for people who haven’t had the same things. I care about people left without a voice. So while this is very loud and out there, I just want you to know that I am an advocate. And I care. And while my life still needs to be on track, I care and will do this with my life and whisper in the right ears and try to make systemic changes for you all. I feel like I can. And I want to. I am passionate about this. About those without a voice. So, have hope. Try to take care of your body. Learn to be kind to yourself, avoid toxic people who disregard you, just be your best friend. You can do it. Make your internal mindset strong enough to change your external world. I believe in you. 🤍✨🦋🫶🏽🌙",0,1746855463.0,cfs,0,0.33,False

After the date he texted about some very innocent and trivial things, like just checking on me because I was a bit sick when I met him and asking how was my gym session. I replied him without asking any questions in return, and wished him goodnight and he texted again, asking me other things like if I have coffee recommendations. 

He's not asked me on a second date and I'm wondering is it too harsh to turn him down in the middle of such a conversation? But I don't want to waste his time either.

————————

Loud music drowned out conversation, although few people were interested in chatting. The beat of the music thumped through Jo’s brain, and she gritted her teeth against the vibration. Lights flashed on and off. The dance floor housed groups of girls dressed in skimpy clothes. Occasionally, a couple danced into view but weren’t dancing as much as they made out on the dance floor. What am I doing here? she wondered. Once again, her workmates had played her for a sucker. The girls at work had a girls’ night out, and as Jo wasn’t a big drinker, she had offered to act as the designated driver. The night had started well, with the group seated at tables together, chatting, laughing, and drinking. For the first time in her working life, she felt like a member of this exclusive group. After their first few drinks, her bubble burst when the girls wandered off, searching for male companions. Jo watched in despair as girl after girl hooked up with a male partner. The girls in her group, who hadn’t found a partner, moved onto the dance floor to dance together. Jo’s head was pounding. The club was hot, and she could feel perspiration trickle down her back and pool under her arms. The excess weight she carried meant that she always felt warm, and in this room crowded with feverish bodies and- inadequate air conditioning, it felt like a sauna. She had dressed in a conservative outfit tonight, but nothing looked great when she weighed one hundred and twenty kilos. She cursed herself for being a fool, realising she shouldn’t have come. Now, it was apparent that these women were not real friends, and they had used her as their taxi home, whenever that might be. Did she have to keep up her part of the bargain, considering the friends who were supposed to hang out together had not upheld their end of the deal? As she looked around, trying to make eye contact with one woman from work, Jo noticed a group of men huddled at a table halfway across the room. Now and then, a man would look over his shoulder and snigger. Gales of laughter followed, and Jo had a good idea of what would come. Her thought proved correct when a man rose and walked towards her. He was an impressive specimen of a man. His designer jeans hugged him tightly, and his crew neck shirt moulded muscles that had probably taken hours at the gym to perfect. Sandy brown hair, styled to display his abundant locks best, topped off a perfect face, all chiselled cheeks and square jaw. This man was way out of Jo’s league, and his approach must be because one of his friends dared him to chat her up. She had been the butt of cruel jokes before; she recognised that her excessive weight was always why men thought she was fair game. “May I sit here?” he asked politely. Jo scrutinised him. “This is obviously of enormous amusement to your friends. Please don’t insult my intelligence by pretending to be interested in me. Tell your mates you asked me for a date or whatever their dare was, and leave me in peace.” The man pressed his hand dramatically against his heart. “You wound me! I would never be so callous as to make you the butt of a joke. I wanted to chat with your to see why you are sitting alone and not dancing with your friends.” “I was stupid enough to offer to act as the designated driver, and the others aren’t friends, more work colleagues.” “I should introduce myself. I’m Chase Donaldson, and I work as a sales agent at a BMW dealer in the city.” “My name is Josephine Bromley, and I work in town as a manager at a PR firm.” “There, that wasn’t too hard, was it?” “Chase, you appear to be a good man. Why don’t you chat up one of the other girls more susceptible to your charms? Surely you must have won your bet by now?!” “Josephine, you are such a doubter. I am not in the middle of a wager and have no dubious motives. Why don’t we chat and see where it goes?” Jo looked beyond Chase’s shoulder; his mates were still glancing over their shoulders and sniggering. “Have a look at your buddies. Their sniggering and covert looks suggest you have some mean prank to pull on me. Your motives aren’t without purpose.” While she had been talking with Chase, her workmates had noticed the exchange and drifted over. Suzanne, blond, tall, and voluptuous, sidled up to Chase. “Hi, honey. Jo is a bit uptight, but I could give you a good time. Do you want to dance with me?” Jo knew how this would go; Chase would thank her for the chat and disappear with Suzanne for the rest of the night. Chase raked his gaze over Suzanne’s breasts and down her waist, paused at her crotch, and slid down her legs. He said, “Thanks for the offer, but we are okay here.” Jo nearly passed out in surprise. Suzanne’s open mouth and wide eyes attested to her feelings at being turned down. She stomped around and then stalked away from the table. Chase laughed out loud. “I don’t think she gets many knockbacks. It’ll do her good.” Jo shook her head in amazement. “You just turned down Suzanne to sit and talk to me. Are you gay?” His loud barking laugh startled her. “You don’t pull any punches, do you? No, I am not gay, but I don’t need sloppy seconds from some woman who’s had her back against a wall out the back and her dress up around her waist.” “If you didn’t come to hook up, why did you come here tonight?” “Well, my friends decided we’ve worked hard all week and needed a break. Speaking of my friends, I should go back and join them. I’ve enjoyed talking to you. Can I call you?” His question bewildered Jo. “If you walk back to your friends and they all burst out laughing, I will dump the contents of my water jug on you. Do you understand?” Chase grinned at her, and butterflies took flight in her stomach; a flush spread up her neck and over her face. She ducked her head. Chase placed a finger under her chin and lifted her face. “That blush is cute; don’t hide it from me. Now, Josephine, hand me your phone so I can put my number in it and here’s my phone; please put your name in the contacts list.” Once Chase had the number, he handed her the phone and returned to sit with his friends. Jo looked over once or twice, and the mates weren’t laughing. She caught Chase’s eye at one stage, and he winked at her, sending the blush straight back up her neck to cover her face. Eventually, her workmates called it a night, and the group departed. Suzanne, who was more than a little inebriated, sneered at her in the car. “Think you’re smart snagging a hottie tonight? He may have wanted to chat this evening, but he is way out of your league. You’d best forget him; guys like that don’t go out with fat chicks like you.” Jo knew this to be correct, but she wanted to believe that this was real for once. When the phone rang early the next day, Jo considered leaving it to voicemail. She was already running late for work; she didn’t have time to talk to random marketers or charities begging for funds. With the shrill ring of her phone again, she double-backed and answered the call. “Hello.” “Josephine? It’s Chase here. Can you talk?” “Ah, good morning, Chase. I’m running late, so I have little time to talk. Why don’t you ring me back in an hour?” “No need to ring back; meet me at Stratford’s for coffee at five-thirty?” Jo laughed. “Sure, see you then.” As she drove to work, Jo was happy. This hot, agreeable man just asked her to meet him for coffee. She tried to concentrate on her new customer information at work but found that Chase’s handsome face kept intruding. What if this was a joke? He asked her to meet him, but would he come? What if she arrived, and he failed to show? Doubts swirled around in her head as her work took less time and concentration. Jo came up with a solution to her problem. She didn’t want to sit at the cafe for hours waiting for a no-show. She could ask him if he was at the coffee shop if she arrived late. That way, she wouldn’t need to put up with pitying looks from the servers when he left her stranded. Before leaving work, Jo ran to the restroom to check her appearance. She headed for the car park with her hair smoothed down and a layer of gloss on her lips. The traffic, as always, was bumper to bumper until she cleared the main thoroughfare and drove along the side streets that led to the cafe. Once she parked, excitement and dread consumed Jo. Would Chase arrive, or would he stand her up? With nerves racing, she stood outside the cafe to look through the window. Chase was not in the room. She backed away; she would wait for five minutes before calling him. As she stood under the porch of a shop across the road, she saw Chase and an attractive blond walk towards the door of the café. The woman reached up and pecked Chase. He pulled her in close and closed his hand over her butt. She laughed and pushed his hand away, and then they parted; he went into the café, and she walked further along the street to the shops. After witnessing the peck between Chase and his girlfriend, Jo did not intend to participate in their scam. She dialled her phone and watched as Chase answered his phone through the window. “Josephine, where are you? I’m waiting for you at the café.” “Sorry, Chase, something has come up. I’ll have to cancel.” “Great, I cleared my calendar so we could get together, and now I’m at a loose end.” “I’m sure you’ll catch up with your girlfriend if you hurry. After that passionate peck, I’m sure she’s ready for more.” Chase's response was a string of profanities, and the phone went dead.",1,1746855158.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1kj2w96,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1kj2w96/suggestions_on_how_or_where_to_start/,Suggestions on how or where to start,"So, I’m just going to lay it all out here to get the best advice I can from y’all on where to start and what to do.

I’m a man in my mid-40s, about 6’4” and weighing around 310 lbs. I don’t have any major physical health issues beyond smoking, degenerative disc disease, and arthritis. I smoke about a pack a day and have tried to quit multiple times over the years—I’m still trying.

As far as exercise goes, I probably only get about 500 steps a day (just guessing here) since I work 4–5 days a week as a limo driver and spend most of that time sitting on my ass. My work hours vary from day to day, but I generally work 12–18 hours within a 24-hour period. Because of my schedule and drive times, I don’t get much sleep—usually just 4 to 6 hours a night.

Proper hydration is a challenge too. Let’s be honest—there aren’t many bathroom breaks when you’re driving clients around, and I can’t just stop to use the restroom. Most days, I drink a large iced coffee with flavored creamer without adding additional sugar, and that lasts me most of the day. If I have a later start, I’ll have 2–4 cups of coffee in the morning and maybe something to eat. I’ve tried black coffee before, but it really upsets my stomach.

Now, about my eating habits: because of the nature of my job, I’m already used to going long stretches without eating. I do have dinner every night, but the timing varies wildly—it could be anywhere from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. I’ll sometimes eat during the day, but it’s usually nothing healthy—mostly fast food or whatever’s convenient. I have a bad habit of overeating, which I’m actively working on through portion control and making myself walk away from the table when I’m done. I’ve mostly cut out soda and am trying to reduce sugar snacks as much as possible—so that’s something. Small victories, I guess.

With all that dirty laundry aired out—what are your thoughts and suggestions on where to start and how to regulate things for someone who’s never done proper fasting before?",1,1746855007.0,fasting,1,1.0,False
1kj2tht,https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA/comments/1kj2tht/does_anyone_else_play_rockstar_games_as_a/,Does anyone else play Rockstar games as a roleplay simulator?,"I've always played Rockstar games as life simulators since GTA IV. I actually try to live the life of the character within the game world. If I'm playing as Niko, I will actually change my clothes every day, try to eat food everyday (Niko doesn't eat 3 meals a day because he's highly depressed) I don't steal cars randomly, I actually use the subway system or Brucie's helicopter/boat pickup and ride from his Friend ability later on in the story. But I'll also walk to the nearest park and pretend to sit on the bench in middle of the night when Niko can't sleep. I'll avoid killing people in missions and use knee shots unless I have to kill people.

I've done the same kind of roleplay in RDR 1&2 as well as GTA V. Like if I'm playing as Micheal, I'll buy a new boat when I can after the first heist and just dive out into the sea to relax or when I'm playing as Arthur in RDR2, I'll make sure to have a cup of coffee in the morning and make sure I eat something 3 times a day. I'll walk into town and get a room and have a bath. I'll respond to NPC's the way I feel like Arthur would depending on the part of the story.

Basically I use my imagination and play these games as if it's another life I'm living as the character I'm playing as.

Does anyone else play these games like I do? ",3,1746854714.0,GTA,0,0.8,False

 Two Months Later  
  
“Are you sure?” dumbfounded, Noémie blurted out.   
  
Her eyes had grown extra wide hearing the words that came out of the doctor's mouth. “Maybe we should do it again. What if you got the wrong results? There’s always a chance for slip-ups, right?”  
  
“You look surprised,” the doctor said, her mouth pulled in a polite smile. Something Noémie found comforting and critical at the same time. “Do you not want one?”  
  
“It’s not like that,” Noémie muttered, releasing a sigh, biting on her lower lip and rubbing her arms. Not because the air-conditioning in the room had got chillier, but because she didn’t know what else to do to keep her hands busy.   
  
Besides, it was also calming in a way. Something she realized she desperately needed right now. Seeing how her heart was causing havoc inside. A huge part of her was offensively terrified.  
  
“It’s just…”   
  
Now, how was she supposed to explain that?  
  
Two months ago, after she woke up in her boss’s bed, she had done everything in her strength to run away from him. She changed the country, the job, the contact details, the friends (well, maybe not all of them), and whatever was possible there to change. She did all that to escape the humiliation. So she wouldn’t have to face that man ever again. She did not even wait for him to apologize for his not-so-sophisticated actions.  
  
In hindsight, it was kind of a rash decision, yet not the one she regretted.  
  
She was so livid with him that day. How could he do this to her?  
  
For three years, she worked for him with all the devotion and sincerity in the world. He was not the easiest person to work for, tossing orders around like a freaking royalty.   
  
But at least he wasn’t a playboy like his younger brother, either. He didn’t flirt with every single thing that moved and breathed and had a pair of perky boobs. Unlike his coquettish brother, Ajax Halest was well-mannered, cultured, and no-nonsense. Something she had admired about him since day one. He always looked so tough and focused. Noémie rarely saw him without his signature grimace. The one that never left him. Not even when he slept.  
  
She struggled to imagine if a man of his stature could ever apologize. He was so arrogant, often, she should know. She alone dealt with his mysterious mood swings all the time.   
  
Until that fateful night when he destroyed the image she had of him when he fell from her eyes so low, she wasn’t certain if there was anything he could do to reverse that.  
  
Burying her face into her hands, she strained her face hard. “I’m not sure if I’m ready for it.”  
  
“You’re nervous,” the doctor said, the pleasant smile continuing to dance across her lips. Her eyes shone with an understanding Noémie hoped to see in her family’s eyes, too. Would they be angry at her? They would probably want to know who the man was. How would she answer the millions of questions they would barrage her with? “Which is absolutely normal.”  
  
Noémie drew in a deep breath and lifted her head. “Are you really sure?” she asked, hoping the answer would be different this time. Although she should have known better than to doubt the capability of her own ears.  
  
“If you want, I can run another test,” the kind doctor suggested, patience reflected through her every word. “But I’m positive the result would remain the same. You’re two months pregnant, Ms Rochester. Congratulations.”  
  
Deep down, Noémie could feel a hurl of emotions. There was so much going on inside her.   
  
That morning, when she woke up, only to throw her guts out, she stupidly thought she might have gotten a stomach bug after one of her colleague’s birthday bash the previous night. She had had no drinks, but there was definitely something fishy about those Manchurian balls. They tasted…different.  
  
Not that it mattered now.  
  
Sighing to herself, Noémie thanked the doctor and collected her reports and prescription before heading out of the hospital.   
  
On her way to the parking lot, though, she was so lost in her thoughts that she failed to notice the man who walked right into her.  
  
All the papers in his and her hands dropped and flew everywhere.  
  
“Dammit!” the man cursed out loud, dropping on his haunches and furiously collecting all the papers. The man seemed to be in so much rush that he growled when he couldn’t distinguish which belonged to who. “They all look exactly the same!”  
  
They didn’t. But he was panicking. But surprisingly, Noémie thought she could see right through him.  
  
Putting aside the pit of her unease, she sank to her knees on the ground and helped him sort everything out. She gathered the papers and read them briefly before stacking them separately.  
  
“Here.” Once done, she pushed all the papers in the file she thought belonged to him and handed them over. “Done!”  
  
The man took the file and stood up, letting his shoulders drop with relief washing over him. “Thank you so much. Although I should probably apologize for running into you first.”  
  
“It’s alright,” Noémie was quick to dismiss his apology. She had noticed how tense and restless he was a moment ago. It was obvious why he wasn’t paying attention to where he was going. Hospitals weren’t the most delightful places in the world. Who knew what distress he was going through? She felt sorry for him. “There is nothing to be apologetic for. Take care of yourself.”  
  
With that, she gave him a nod and turned towards the spot where she had parked her car. It wasn’t far from where she had bumped into that poor man.  
  
————  
  
Little did she know that the accident wasn’t actually an accident.   
  
The man who bumped into her did that on purpose, to serve an even greater purpose.  
  
As he watched Noémie getting into the car and driving away, he took the phone out of his pocket and dialed a number.   
  
After three rings, someone finally picked up and answered.  
  
“She’s in Bordeaux,” he furnished confidently.  
  
“Are you sure it’s her?”  
  
“Absolutely positive.”  
  
The man on the other end of the phone hummed thoughtfully. “Anything else?”  
  
“She visited the hospital today.”  
  
“For what?”  
  
“I’m not sure,” he rubbed his temples, turning around to protect his eyes from the blunt rays of the sun. “But she looked anxious and lost while leaving.”  
  
“Get in and find out whatever she was there for. You have an hour.”  
  
The man nodded firmly. “On it.”  
  


# Chapter 2

Later that day, when Noémie reached her apartment, she had barely unlocked the door when she heard the loud sound of another door slamming shut across the hallway.  
  
“Rochester,” a male voice called out from behind her, surprising her. “Funny seeing you here. Your boss suddenly tripped over the concept of a day off, eh?”  
  
Noémie struggled to fight a smile as she turned on her heels and came face to face with Gaël Marchant—a handsome pilot who lived on the same floor as her and owned the most beautiful car in the entire building.  
  
He was pretty cocky about it, and even though he could afford a much better, more luxurious place than this building offered, he seemed perfectly content with his stay. Noémie had tried to understand his reasons at first, but with so much on her plate, she eventually gave up.  
  
“If I say yes, will that make you feel better?” she asked with a smile, flipping her dark hair off her shoulder as she moved her arms behind her back, not wanting him to see the file she was carrying.  
  
For some reason, she thought he would judge her if he found out about her current predicament. And despite them being nothing more than good neighbors, she didn’t like the idea of tarnishing her reputation in his eyes. Perhaps a bit cocky, but he was one of the good guys, and, sadly, his company meant a lot to her in this far-off city.  
  
He hummed. “Depends…”  
  
“On what?”  
  
“How long your boss can keep up the righteous act and continue to have some mercy on your poor, overworked soul?”  
  
“You think I’m overworked?”  
  
“Have you seen yourself in the mirror?”  
  
Noémie pursed her lips, unsure if he was serious or just fooling around.  
  
But then he broke into laughter, and she breathed a sigh of relief.  
  
“You’re an i\*\*\*t!” she pouted, shaking her head as she turned to unlock her apartment door.  
  
Gaël laughed, leaning his shoulder against the wall as he watched her struggle with the key. “Here, let me help,” he offered, raising his arm to reach for the key.  
  
Noémie hadn’t expected the offer. While she continued to fumble with the lock, his warm hand clamped over hers, and she stiffened.  
  
Their eyes met briefly before he gently nudged her aside and took her place instead.  
  
Now standing off to the side, Noémie watched, wrapping her arms around herself, as he smoothly pushed the key in and, with some magical technique she failed to notice—thanks to his large hands—unlocked the door with a satisfying click.  
  
The grin on his face was cockier than ever as he stepped back and gave the door a gentle push. “Here you go, Your Highness,” he teased, dropping the key back into her hand before thrusting his hands into his jeans pockets.  
  
“Thanks for the help, Gaël,” Noémie muttered, feeling a slight heat rush up her neck. She had no idea why she was suddenly so flustered. She’d always been good at handling his weirdness. Perhaps the news of her pregnancy had turned her into a sensitive mess. She could only hope to sort herself out before things got out of hand.  
  
Gaël only nodded before taking another step back. “So, are you coming to the rooftop party tonight? It’s Steven’s ninth birthday. Maybe Mrs. Colbert will finally open the bar this time.”  
  
“No. But keep dreaming,” she chuckled, finally stepping inside her apartment and turning to face him. “Mrs. Colbert’s ex-husband died of an alcohol overdose. She wouldn’t want to expose her dear son to something like that.”  
  
Mrs. Colbert was the landlord who owned the entire building and lived on the ground floor. She was kind and thoughtful but strict—and a little intimidating when it came to rent and her son.  
  
“Really?” He sounded surprised. “I thought those were just rumors,” he said, scratching the back of his head.  
  
“Oh, they are so not. Take my advice and stop spoiling her son. Because once she figures out all the ridiculous tips you’ve been giving him to impress girls, she’ll throw you out so fast you won’t know what hit you,” she teased, though there wasn’t a single lie in her words.  
  
Gaël narrowed his eyes, rubbing his neck briefly. “Oh well, why didn’t you warn me earlier?” he said, making a face like someone had just saved him from running a red light. “I guess I’ll have to cancel our top-secret meeting for today then,” he added with all the seriousness in the world before a slight grin once again claimed his handsome face.  
  
He leaned closer to her doorway. “Since my schedule just cleared up for the next hour or so, how about I take you out for coffee? You just saved me from losing my place, after all. Let me treat you to a pleasant drink and some almond croissants. What do you say?” he winked.  
  
Noémie chuckled at his sudden shift in demeanor. But she knew he was only messing with her, just like he did with every single woman in the building. That being said, he almost sounded genuine in his offer.  
  
“Unfortunately, I’ll have to say no. Sorry. I’m not feeling too well. I should probably get some rest.”  
  
When Gaël opened his mouth, Noémie thought he was about to say something. But instead, he covered his mouth with his hand and brushed his lower lip.  
  
“Well then, you better take care of yourself, Rochester. Call me if you need anything.”  
  
And with that, he turned on his heels and was gone.  
  
Noémie stood there for a while, her door half-open, wondering if his offer had been sincere. It couldn’t be, right? He was probably just pulling her leg, seeing as there was a distinct lack of men in her life. He liked to do that a lot.  
  
Sighing to herself, she stepped back inside and closed the door.  
  
That evening, Mrs. Colbert showed up, inviting her to the birthday party. But Noémie had to politely refuse—she wasn’t feeling particularly festive, and the idea of faking a good time was too exhausting for her already worn-out mind.  
  
Thankfully, Mrs. Colbert didn’t seem to mind. In fact, she told her not to hesitate if she needed anything. At that moment, the back of Noémie’s eyes prickled with hot tears. She suddenly felt so emotional, her face growing red as she struggled to hold them back.  
  
Mrs. Colbert must have noticed something because, after leaving to attend the party, she returned later with a slice of cake just for Noémie. The gesture was so sweet, it touched her deeply.  
  
That entire night, Noémie couldn’t sleep. She kept scrolling up and down her phone, unsure whether to call her sister or not. Claudia was the only person she could trust right now. Besides, she desperately needed someone to vent to—someone to listen to her frustrations and anxieties.  
  
There was so much she wanted to say.  
  
To scream.  
  
To yell.  
  
But living alone in this godforsaken city meant she had no one to confide in.  
  
And it sucked. So much.  
  
—————  
  
Noémie wasn’t sure what time it was when the doorbell rang—twice.  
  
With a weary frown, she rolled out of bed and switched on the lights.  
  
First, she checked the time.  
  
The wall clock displayed 4:18 AM.  
  
That was weird.  
  
Who could possibly be outside her door at this hour? Was there some kind of emergency? The last time someone bothered her in the middle of the night was during a false fire alarm. She really hoped this wasn’t another one of those. She was too exhausted to leave her bed so early.  
  
The doorbell rang again.  
  
Rubbing her eyes, she tightened the knot of her robe and dragged herself toward the door.  
  
Whoever was outside was growing impatient. Instead of concern, annoyance scratched at Noémie’s face.  
  
Ready to give the person a piece of her mind, she unlatched the door and swung it open.  
  
“What—”  
  
But the words barely left her lips before her eyes landed on the man standing across from her.  
  
The color drained from her face.  
  
A jolt of shock shot down her spine as a lump formed in her throat.  
  
What was he doing here?  
  
Standing before her, dressed in a crisp Armani suit, was the brother of the man who had ruined her life.  
  
The man responsible for the pain she still carried.  
  
Vincent Halest smiled, his sharp gray eyes glinting.

Payton  
  
A RED AND GOLD LEAF FLOATS ACROSS THE ROOM, SEEMINGLY WEIGHTLESS, BEFORE SETTLING ONTO the carpet between my spot on the couch and the TV.  
  
I glance at my open patio door where another gust of wind brings the scent of promised rain, but instead of getting up, I tuck my legs underneath me and pull my fleece blanket up to my chin, careful not to tip the bowl of popcorn resting on the cushion next to me.  
  
A storm is coming.  
  
You spoiled brat, I’m gonna teach you…  
  
I snuggle further into the corner of my couch. That was so long ago, I remind myself, inhaling deeply through my nose, willing new memories to replace the old.  
  
This is my home.  
  
I’m safe here.  
  
The low rumble of distant thunder calms me further.  
  
No matter how much they tried to beat it out of me, I never lost my love of violent weather.  
  
I never understood why I was supposed to be scared of storms. Didn’t understand why it made me different, or wrong, or stupid––like they claimed.  
  
It wasn’t the violence I craved, it was the change. The washing away. The cleansing. That smallest sliver of hope that a wave might crash through, dragging away the old, leaving something new.  
  
And maybe that’s why I still like them. There’s still that spot in my chest, deep inside of me, that wants to be sucked up into the sky, whisked away from it all, and dropped into Oz.  
  
As if summoned by the wind, the woman on screen opens her front door and the world around her morphs from black and white to color, and I let the familiar sense of nostalgia wash over me.  
  
The sounds of the nearing storm keep filtering in and out of my awareness, even as I sway my head to the familiar songs.  
  
My hand is halfway to my mouth, popcorn between my fingers, when the dull noise of groaning metal drags my gaze to the patio, the sliding glass door open wide.  
  
The gauzy curtains I installed last year are flowing eerily with the breeze, but the streetlamp outside is burnt out, so I can’t see beyond my tiny balcony.  
  
I’ve never really trusted that balcony, it’s as shabby as the rest of this building. But I figured it’d take more than a little inclement weather to knock it down.  
  
I give myself a mental gold star for never bothering with furniture out there as I lick the salt off my fingers.  
  
Another roll of thunder, closer this time, draws my attention back to the balcony.  
  
And the man standing in my open door.  
  
CHAPTER 2  
  
Payton  
  
A SCREAM CATCHES IN MY THROAT, TOO STRANGLED TO BE HEARD. I’m dreaming.  
  
My eyes squeeze shut, and I force myself to breathe.  
  
I must be dreaming.  
  
But when I open them again, the man is still there. And coming closer.  
  
The man crosses half of my apartment in two long strides, putting him only feet away.  
  
Adrenaline courses through my body, yet I don’t move.  
  
To my own humiliation, I don’t do anything.  
  
There’s a man in my home.  
  
Aside from the television, the lamp in the corner is the only light on. And it does little to illuminate the man in front of me.  
  
He’s tall. I’m sitting but I can tell he’s tall. And… he’s wearing a suit.  
  
Why is he wearing a suit?  
  
Does that make this worse?  
  
“Evening.” His voice is deep. But gentle. Soft even. And my brain doesn’t know how to react. My heart is racing.  
  
My hands are shaking.  
  
But the rest of me doesn’t move.  
  
“You know,” he says, as he takes a few slow steps, crossing in front of the TV. “You really shouldn’t leave your door open like that.”  
  
My lips part, but my words get jumbled on my tongue and I have to swallow before trying again.  
  
“I’m on the second floor,” I whisper, still trying to understand what’s happening.  
  
He tilts his head, and it feels like he’s humoring my response, but I can’t focus on that. Because the angle allows the light to fall across his features. And…  
  
Dark eyes. Dark brows. Nearly black hair tousled yet styled back, and sharp cheekbones outlined with a trimmed beard in the same shade.  
  
I swallow again.  
  
He looks like he came from a photoshoot. Or a boardroom. Or a photoshoot of a boardroom. And an inner voice is shouting at me that that should make this even scarier.  
  
Should.  
  
I also notice that his clothes aren’t wet, which means the rain hasn’t started. And for some reason, that saddens me. Like that detail alone seals my ruin.  
  
This is why I’ve always been such a victim.  
  
My instincts are broken. My mind always steers away from the important parts. Zeroing in on ridiculous details, and not on a game plan.  
  
Keeping his body facing me, the man glances around my apartment.  
  
I don’t know a lot about men’s suits, but I’m guessing his clothes cost more than all my belongings put together.  
  
My stuff isn’t fancy, and it looks just as cheap as it is. A second hand couch and scuffed coffee table. The small TV on a cheap stand I had to assemble myself with an Allen wrench. My round table with one chair, tucked in the corner. And a thin stretch of island designating the divide between the living room and kitchen. A kitchen that’s more of a kitchenette, complete with laminate counters that are peeling at the edges.  
  
I resist the urge to sigh at the sight of my phone sitting on said kitchen counter. Mocking me with the idea of calling the police, knowing I’ll never get the chance.  
  
Not that they’ve ever helped me in the past.  
  
My single bedroom and bathroom are on the other side of the kitchen, but darkness swallows them.  
  
The man makes a noise in the back of his throat as he takes it all in. I have no idea what he’s thinking. Or why I should be so anxious for his approval. Like there’s anything in this sad setting to approve of. Or any benefit if one’s murderer likes their apartment.  
  
A police siren wails outside.  
  
Then another.  
  
And a moment later, I watch the flash of red and blue lights bounce down through the night as cop cars speed past my building.  
  
Slowly, I turn my gaze back to the man facing me.  
  
He lifts a shoulder, and the edge of his mouth pulls up into a smirk.  
  
This man is running from the cops.  
  
He’s running from the cops and he’s standing in my living room. Like nothing is amiss. Like he just decided to take a different route home.  
  
His body shifts and I think that maybe that’s all this will be. The police have passed by, now he can leave.  
  
But he lifts a foot and steps closer.  
  
Panic starts to flare brighter inside me, hitting its flash point, when another gust of wind lifts the edge of his suit jacket.  
  
Oh god, he has a gun.  
  
He doesn’t reach for it though. He just… lowers himself onto the couch. My couch.  
  
Beside me.  
  
Once again, my mouth opens with nothing coming out.  
  
What is he doing?  
  
What is happening?  
  
“I love this movie,” he says, almost to himself.  
  
What. In. The. Hell. Is happening?  
  
His large body fills up too much space on the couch. All my furniture is small. Small because my apartment is small. Small because it’s only ever me here.  
  
I sit frozen, wondering if I should say something, but he keeps his focus on the tv.  
  
Is he… is he just gonna stay here?  
  
I start to shift, wondering if I can just get up and slip away.  
  
“I’d rather you didn’t get up.” He doesn’t turn his head when he says it, his tone casual. But there’s no hiding the fact that it’s not a request.  
  
My breathing picks up, as I remain facing forward. Prickles running up and down my arms.  
  
Great, now my animal reaction decides to catch up to the situation. There’s no question that this man is dangerous.  
  
And he’s too close.  
  


# 2

I never let men get this close.  
  
My entire body starts to tremble. “Please don’t—” I cut off my plea, not wanting to put my specific fears into words.  
  
I can hear the rustle of fabric as he starts to turn toward me, and I squeeze my eyes shut.  
  
This can’t be happening.  
  
This can’t be real.  
  
“Relax.”  
  
A large hand settles on my thigh, and I stiffen even more.  
  
The weight of his palm is alarming, the heat of his touch searing me through the blanket.  
  
His hand presses down with a little more force. “Relax.”  
  
His tone is even gentler this time, and I try to take a steady breath. A dark scent fills my nostrils. It’s leather and fire and cologne.  
  
Jesus, is that him?  
  
My eyes slip open.  
  
He’s leaning toward me, invading my space further, and the stance should feel dominating. But there’s something in his body language, or maybe it’s something in his eyes, that makes my body obey. Makes me relax, just a little.  
  
His gaze travels over my face, and this close, I can see a tinge of green in his eyes. They’re stunning.  
  
His eyes move back to mine. “I’m not going to hurt you.”  
  
When I don’t reply, he tips his head down, a command implied with the movement.  
  
“Okay.” I mostly mouth the word, my voice too quiet to hear, but he nods anyway, a pleased look crossing his features.  
  
Pleased that I believe him?  
  
Do I believe him?  
  
His hand slides off my thigh, taking the heat with him. “May I?” May you what?!  
  
Before I have time to start spiraling, he lifts the bowl of popcorn from the spot between us.  
  
Oh.  
  
Without waiting for an answer, he settles back, props his feet up on the coffee table and sets the bowl on his lap. Then, casual as ever, he drapes one arm across the back of the couch, fingers nearly touching my shoulder, like he’s here for a date and not a home invasion.  
  
I watch as he starts to eat the popcorn, whole handfuls at a time, never dropping a single piece on himself.  
  
I should do something.  
  
There must be something I should do.  
  
His jaw works as he chews, the muscles in the side of his neck flexing.  
  
I mean I know I should leave. Or make him leave. But how?  
  
With my eyes still on his profile, waiting for whatever’s going to happen next, I hear the character on the screen talk about courage. And I wish more than anything I had some.  
  
“What’s your name?”  
  
I jump when he speaks, then bite my lip. “Um… I don’t think I should tell you that.” I see his eyes flick over in my direction. “Clever girl.” Those two syllables bounce across my skin.  
  
My fingers tighten around the blanket, pulling it even higher. I can’t find this man attractive.  
  
I really can not.  
  
My stomach clenches and my stupid brain takes this moment to remind me that I probably look like a disheveled mess.  
  
Not that it matters. I don’t need this intruder to think I’m sexy. In fact it’s probably better that he doesn’t. It’s probably better that I have popcorn breath and a ponytail that needs adjusting. And bangs that are going every which way since they got damp when I washed the makeup off my face before sitting down to watch my favorite movie for the four-hundredth time.  
  
The fingers near my shoulder tap against the backrest, keeping in time with the characters on TV as they skip down the road.  
  
This has got to be the weirdest thing that’s ever happened to me.  
  
A hot as hell man walks in through my second story balcony. Strolls through my apartment with a confidence I can only dream of having. Flashes me a glimpse of his gun. Then settles in to eat my popcorn.  
  
And… is he humming?  
  
Sweet Mother Mary, he’s humming.  
  
With careful, small movements, I push myself further into the corner. Trying to add any amount of distance I can between us.  
  
I want to ask his name. Ask him what he’s running from. But I feel like the less knowledge I have, the better.  
  
Except you’ve seen his face, my inner voice unhelpfully reminds me.  
  
Not knowing what else to do, I stare at his profile. Watching the way the light dances off his eyes. The way his mouth opens and closes around handfuls of popcorn. The way his shoulders seem relaxed.  
  
He seems so at ease. So… comfortable.  
  
My lids lower in a slow blink and I force them wide.  
  
I can’t make out the clock on the microwave from here, but I know it’s past my bedtime. I didn’t intend on staying up for the entire film because waking up at five a.m. every weekday means I go to bed early. And I haven’t been sleeping well this week. Hell, I haven’t been sleeping well the past twenty-seven years.  
  
He chews another mouthful, and I watch the movement of his Adam’s apple as he swallows. Maybe this really is all a dream.  
  
Maybe I’m already in bed, sound asleep",1,1746854224.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1kj2np6,https://www.reddit.com/r/University/comments/1kj2np6/no_ivy_no_problem_the_top_global_universities_of/,No Ivy? No Problem! The Top Global Universities of 2025 (That Aren’t in the U.S.),"So, Times Higher Ed just dropped their 2025 rankings of the best universities outside the U.S., and I gotta say — it’s basically the Champions League of education. And spoiler alert: the UK and Asia are out here playing academic chess while the rest are still figuring out the rules of checkers.

Oxford takes the crown again, because of course it does. Somewhere, a guy in tweed just lit a celebratory pipe. Right behind are Cambridge and Imperial College London, who’ve clearly decided Britain will stay relevant academically, even if geopolitics has gone full Brexit.

Now here’s where it gets spicy. ETH Zürich (a.k.a. Einstein’s alma mater) is holding it down for Switzerland — proving they don’t just do chocolate and banking, they also breed geniuses. Asia is absolutely crushing it too: Tsinghua, Peking, NUS, UTokyo, and NTU are rising so fast you’d think they’ve figured out how to 10x research with AI and boba tea.

Canada enters the chat with University of Toronto and McGill, and honestly? If you’re looking for a world-class education with universal healthcare and Tim Hortons, that’s your sign.

Germany, as usual, shows up with its efficient, well-oiled academic machine: LMU Munich, TU Munich, and Heidelberg are making sure beer and brains are not mutually exclusive.

And let’s not sleep on France, Australia, Sweden, and South Korea — all placing serious contenders. Meanwhile, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Netherlands are quietly building academic empires while everyone’s distracted by ChatGPT hallucinations.

Couple of wild academic facts that blew my mind:
	•ETH Zürich gave the world Einstein, so basically if your thesis isn’t bending space-time, don’t even try.
	•Oxford has more Nobel Prize winners than the GDP of some small nations.
	•McGill alumni include astronauts and William Shatner — yes, Captain Kirk went there.

The real takeaway?
You don’t need to bleed Ivy green to win in life. The global university scene is more lit than ever. Whether you’re gunning for a postgrad, scouting for your next genius co-founder, or just ranking places based on proximity to good coffee — these schools are worth watching.

It’s no longer about where you study, it’s about how globally connected your uni is. And some of these schools are running rings around the traditional U.S. heavyweights.

So if you’re still thinking MIT or bust… think again.

Would love to hear where y’all are applying or dreaming to go. Anyone here studying at one of these? What’s it really like?",0,1746854105.0,University,0,0.5,False

My workplace, in North Carolina, is beyond toxic and I’ve stayed because of the money. I work in a “fancy” steakhouse and the money is better here than the other options available to me currently. I love my coworkers. We go out after work regularly, celebrate each other’s birthdays and go out to lunches together on our days off. It’s difficult to leave this type of camaraderie.

The problem is the owner. He creates an environment where we’re constantly in the wrong, our efforts are never enough and believes everyone one of his staff is stealing from him. Every single day one of us or a few of us are targeted by him and creates problems that only lead to confusion and stress.

I had to get between him and a new server the other night because he had been tormenting her all day and she’d made a few mistakes because of the heightened anxiety he causing her. End of the night he followed her to the dish pit and was chewing her out to the point that she was shaking uncontrollably. I stepped between the two of them and told him stop. If I hadn’t been there he would have continued harassing her.

Lately he’s decided that charging servers for mistakes is acceptable. One server forgot ring in a coffee. Coffee that was about to poured out because it was closing time. He still charged her. The other night, two servers were on a party table of 20 guests. The host made up the ticket for them to give to the guest who made the reservation. The appetizer platters weren’t added to the ticket. Now the owner is telling them that he’s going to take that money out of those servers paychecks. I know that charging severs for mistakes is illegal and I’m going to push for proper remedy before taking further action.

The busers are tipped out based on how many guests we have. They get 60 cents per guest. Their hourly is $2.13. I’m not sure if that’s legal or not because they have no control over their tipping situation the way servers do.

What I’m posting here for is advice on what information I need to collect before taking further action? If going to The Department of Labor or getting an attorney is the better approach?

Happy to answer any questions as long as they don’t lead to doxing myself or the restaurant.

I do have a Zerno z1 in the wait so grinder isn’t an issue. I’m mostly on very light to medium light beans(SEY, Devoción, coffee collective…), drinking both pour over and espresso and milk drinks, depends on the mood of the day.I'm now torn between Micra, De1Pro and Argos. I chose these mostly bc of the size as my space is tiny and the table depth is very limiting. I also want something robust and heat up quick, but compact.

Micra bc I always wanted a LM and it's the smallest and ""cheapest"", but it's just a flat profile machine and lacking many features, and the so called pre-brew function is meh. Yes slayer mod is possible but that means another 700 euros+tariffs(thank you trump). That makes the final machine come to 5k+USD range, seems very unreasonable.

De1pro seems more fun with all the digital stuff and technically can produce the best results, but the pump noise just sounds so eh, unpleasant. And no white option(XL doesn't quite fit my space) is a down side as look is important at this price range, I still want it to fit my kitchen. Another thing is I’m not sure the “build quality” and have also heard of buggy software.

Argos seems like a legit choice for a fun spring lever machine and is the cheapest among the three. I put it in because it’s such a unique level machine, I like the air bleed valve, have great temp control, and it uses 58mm portafilter, and a very very small footprint. but somehow my heart still itches to own a dual boiler machine if it's going to be a boiler type machine. Plus it seems like it would be an overlap with my current F58.

1kj2fy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1kj2fy3/met_her_on_my_birthday/,Met her on my birthday,"I (27M) lost the love of my life 2 years ago. She was my first serious girlfriend and I love her more than anything I had ever thought possible. My childhood wasn’t great I only met my biological father once (in court) and was open about the fact he wanted nothing to do with me, my mom died when I was 14 of a heroin overdose in a rite aid bathroom, and the man I called dad while I know he ment good, had anger issues and was verbally abusive telling me things such as that I’m worthless and waste of sperm and pretty much anything you could think of If he was pissed enough. I was overweight and bullied in school and I struggled to make friends long story short I lived a lot of my childhood and all of my teens depressed. Im no movie star and have always struggled to talk to girls but as I got more into my late teens and early 20’s I tried and tried to get a girl to be interested in me, though every dating app known to man I tried asking out a girl I worked with tried being nice to strangers but nothing worked I was just slumping into a deeper and deeper depression until somehow I managed to meet the absolutely most cutest, shyest girl ever and on my birthday of all days I felt like I hit the lottery jackpot I was so happy I felt happiness and feelings I had never felt in my life it was the best birthday present I could have ever asked for. A month later we start dating officially and were together happily for about 2 years never having an argument always just happy to be in each others company and be together doing things she understood me and I felt like I could be myself around her instead of hiding myself like usual and it was the first and only time in my life I actually felt happy, I didn’t feel self conscious, and I had some confidence in myself. One week she was supposed to come over on a Friday, but she said her mom traded shifts with someone at work so instead of Friday she was going to come over on Thursday instead so she could be home to let her dogs out NBD. She comes over Thursday and spends the night like usual. But when we wake up in the morning she tells me she had this very weird nightmare of some weird guy /shadowy figure that was following her around I didn’t really think much of it but had her assure me that she was alright and then I had to head off to work unfortunately. She slept in a little longer but woke up like 2 hours later and texted me that she was going to drop me off a coffee at work on her way to her home. She came I spent a few minutes with her in the parking lot kissed her goodbye and told her I loved her. Finished my work day and went home we called and talked on my way home from work around 4, texted afterwards but then at 7pm she stops responding to everything I don’t find it to be that weird at first because I’m not the type to demand she be texting me 24/7 but by 10:30/11 as im starting to get ready for bed and she’s still not responding I’m getting kinda worried but not blowing her phone up. I lay down anyway and am woken up to a call around 3am from her mother saying she came home and found her lying on the bathroom floor. 3 dreadful months of not knowing what happened we finally get word that she had a undiagnosed heart defect from birth and she just dropped dead instantly from a heart attack. After it happened I called my entire immediate family, ( I have many siblings some half some not technically blood, 2 of them being from my before mentioned biological father that I didn’t even know existed until I was 18 and they sought me out and found me) and everyone on the surface was supportive and telling me they’re here for me and all of that. But in practice not a single one of them besides one of my brothers can even have the time to wish me a happy birthday or merry Christmas let alone legitimately check in on me. It makes me feel so many ways, maybe i deserve it, maybe it’s because im not related or only half related to them unlike their other siblings, could be many reasons im not sure but I know that I live in a hole. I’m so depressed now nothing matters to me I’ve stopped taking care of myself, I eat like shit and I tell myself that every breath I take is a waste of fresh air. I just feel like there’s nothing for me. Like I said I always felt like I hit the lottery with her and not many people can hit the jackpot twice in life. I’m not even sure if I want to move on. I still love her so deeply but I’m also so damn lonely I miss having someone to wake up next too to have a girl to call beautiful constantly and someone to share life with. But on the other side I have some unappealing features that could make it hard for a girl to get interested in me for example between her death and now I’ve started balding pretty bad and now have a spot on top of my head, I can’t cook for shit and all I do is play video games when I’m not working.

The property was unfinished (abandoned remodel), had been sitting empty for three years, and had disgusting carpet but a view that people would kill for. 

I was paying below market rate rent. If they had listed it on the open market, due to the condition it was in, I'm not sure if they could have rented it out for much more. 

They refused to give me a lease, preferred to keep it simple and go month to month. I lived there for about a year and a half and enjoyed it very much. It was more space than I could otherwise afford and I loved drinking coffee in the morning while looking over the city and the mountains from the window. 

They jerked me around a bit. Telling me they needed me to move out and then going back on it multiple times, raising and lowering rent arbitrarily, and finally they doubled my rent and told me to get a roommate in exchange for a 1 year lease. 

I agreed and found a roommate. Took about 30 hours worth of effort in total to get to that point. 

Once I found a roommate however, they decided they didn't want to do that and decided they were going to sell the place. Well they had to sell the place, they bought a new place and were doing some tax thing to swap the properties and forgo capital gains tax. Something they would not have been able to do without establishing rental income from me. 

They told me I had a little under two months to move out (I was entitled to 60 days written notice by law but they were family and it was close enough). I acted accordingly. After 3 weeks, they showed up with a realtor unannounced and promptly told me I had to be out in a week. 

I was furious. I had had a place lined up for the 1st of the next month as was the original plan. But had nowhere to go for the 3 weeks in between. I told them that. 

They said first, to get a hotel. I told them I can't afford a 3 week hotel stay. They told to me to ask my parents for money. I said no. 

Then they said they found an Airbnb I could stay at for that time that was cheaper than my rent and they would pay 1/3 of the cost but I had to get rid of my cat because the Airbnb didn't allow cats. I was furious. 

I value my cat above anyone else. I've had him since I was a teenager and all through college and he moved out to California with me. 

I told them I would be enforcing my full rights as a tenant. And staying until the end of a 60 days written notice period. Refusing unsupervised access for contractors for the remodel, enforcing habitability standards, and demanding repairs be made to things that were not in working order.

They lost their shit. Gave me a sob story about how they have to sell it because they already bought the other place. They did me a favor by renting me an unfinished, kinda gross condo at a cheap price and that all they are asking for is a favor in return. I said that favor would be making me and my cat homeless for 3 weeks and spending more than I could afford to with a new security deposit on the horizon. 

They said well what can we do to get you out. I demanded cash for keys. I laid out what a suitable Airbnb would cost for 3 weeks, moving expenses x2, and compensation for my time and energy at my hourly rate for my current job. Plus a hardship fee of $500. I said I am not negotiating at this point. If you say no, I will enforce my full rights. 

They reluctantly agreed. And are now pissed and seem to think I extorted them.

My job had an office party a few weeks ago and after it was done a few of us went out to a nearby bar together and sometime later into the night M and me started talking about dating etc (M is dating T who also works with us, and I was/am dating my “bf” of like 1 month at the time (I put bf in quotations because we weren’t that serious at the time)


Anyways convo shifted and got a little spicier and M was calling me pretty and said that that T (M’s boyfriend) thinks so too and that we should all hang out more often outside of work and have “adult fun” I laughed and politely said ohh I don’t think so, my boyfriend wouldn’t like that and wrapped it up. I didn’t mention it to my boyfriend because he is confrontational and I didn’t want him to blow things out of proportion or be upset.

after that night I tried to keep showing up to work like normal but then M and T started doing things like T bringing me coffee, M playing with my hair when she came over to my desk to talk to me, T insisting to walk my bags to my car, etc. 

Earlier everything built up and when I went to see my boyfriend after work i just started venting to him. He was mad that I didn’t say anything sooner to him or that I didn’t tell my boss and asked if I liked the guy (I absolutely do not but I don’t think he believes me) I told him that this is my first “good” job after graduating college last year and I didn’t want to ruin it by burning any bridges and didn’t wanna mess with anyone’s job.

1kj22kz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1kj22kz/i_just_miss_my_dad/,I just miss my dad.,"Here’s my message into the void. 

My dad passed very suddenly from cardiac arrest four months ago. He was here one minute, and gone the next. I am 32 years old and somehow still depended on my dad for so much. He was truly one of my best friends. He was a part of every piece of my life. I managed the coffee shop that he owned so we worked very closely together as well. He was the best person, everyone who knew him loved him. Even after four months the shock still hasn’t worn off. I just can’t believe that he’s gone. I feel like I’ve already reached the stage where people look at me and can’t understand why I’m still so sad. But I just truly don’t know how to live this life without him. It feels like every good thing has been ripped from the world. 

I also recently got married. My fiancé and I went through a long immigration process and he had finally just arrived and we were so excited to get married and start our life together. My dad loved my fiancé and was so excited for our wedding. He missed it, and we had to get married without him there. One of the happiest days of my life turned out to be one of the saddest as well. 

My dad’s birthday is two days after mine, and our birthdays are coming up next week and I’m dreading it. We always celebrated together, but he would always let me pick what I wanted to do and now I feel sad because I should have let him pick more often. I’d give anything to celebrate even one more birthday with him. 

I’ve also been left with the weight of trying to manage and run the coffee shop that he owned, and it’s a job that I’ve honestly always hated but now that he’s not there it’s just unbearable. I feel so trapped because it’s also my mom’s source of income so it has to keep going but the weight is so heavy. 

I feel like everything about who I am as a person is changing. All I feel now is anger, sadness, loneliness, and rage. I hate the person I’m becoming but I don’t have the energy to try to be better. I feel like I’m letting my dad down in every area. He would want me to be a better person but I’m just so angry and sad that he’s gone and I just can’t make myself care about anything. 

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. I know so many of you on this sub can understand what I’m feeling and honestly this sub has been a source of comfort. I’m sad that so many of us have to go through this but it’s also strangely comforting to know that I’m not alone.

1kj20pw,https://v.redd.it/0m5bshiftvze1,Who is using JetBrains + Cursor together ? I made a plugin to make switching between them less annoying.,"Not sure how common this is, but I often use both **JetBrains IDEs** and **Cursor** — Cursor for its AI integration, and JetBrains for static analysis.

But there’s one small pain: every time I switch to Cursor, I have to reopen the file and scroll to the right line before i can ask the question.

Sure, it only takes about 8 seconds (on a good day), but if you do it often — or land on the wrong file by mistake — it can really break the flow.

So I built a small plugin for myself called **Code Portal** (available on the JetBrains Marketplace).

With one shortcut — `Open In Cursor` — it:

* Opens project and file in Cursor (also works with VSCode and Windsurf)
* Jumps to the exact line you were on
* Auto-selects the relevant code

I’ve been using it daily, and it’s made things noticeably smoother.

If you jump between JetBrains and Cursor (or other VSCode-based editors) frequently, this plugin might help you too! Open to any feedback, suggestions, or roasts.

  
**‼️ Disclaimer:** It’s a paid plugin with a free trial. I offer a perpetual license at an affordable price — if you find it useful, consider buying a license to support me. It really motivates me to keep improving it and helps cover some of my coffee ☕.  
  
💡 **Pro Tips**

* Set a keyboard shortcut to quickly jump to your preferred editor
* Install the `Code Portal` VSCode extension to enable text selection support

""The Empty Cup Between Us""

She bloomed in front of me—
not all at once,
but in slow, spiraling truths
unspooled over the rim of her cup.

That café on 5th,
chalk menus and clinking glass,
her choosing caramel-something
with a smile that didn’t quite fit her eyes.
I took mine black—
bitter, clean, and quiet.

We sat by the window
where the light made things look softer than they felt.
She started with harmless things:
a movie that disappointed,
a coworker’s laugh,
how morning traffic makes her feel invisible.

Then came the gravity—
her childhood tucked into metaphors,
the way her mother folded silence into casseroles,
the way her father taught her
to speak without expecting an echo.

Her words moved like weather—
gentle at first, then thunderous,
and I,
sat in the hush between clouds,
letting the rain say everything.

My coffee disappeared sip by sip,
each pause of hers
a chance to breathe her in.
Her cup stayed untouched,
steam swirling above it like smoke from a fire
she couldn’t put out—
not yet.

I think she knew.
That I wasn’t there to fix,
or weigh her pain against my own.
Only to be a place
where her voice could land
and not shatter.

By the time she stopped—
by the time the tremble softened
in her fingertips around the cup—
mine was long gone,
discarded, forgotten,
and hers was still mostly full,
still warm.

I had barely spoken.
But in that silence,
I’d never felt more heard.",1,1746851524.0,poetry_critics,4,1.0,False

I usually try to decline any orders with coffee in them. I've accepted one, and it went horribly. I have to bike about 5 km to the customer, the terrain is very hilly, and the road is filled with potholes, so the coffee ended up ripping through the paper bag, and it felt horrible, I felt like that was the start of when everything went wrong, because I still have nightmares about it.

Then it happened again today. It rained nonstop for three days straight. It was not strong, just a light drizzle, but the road was still very wet and bumpy. Usually, when an order has a drink in it, Uber will tell you with the little yellow square, but this time it didn't show up, and I accepted it, not knowing it had coffee in it.

I didn't check the details of the order, but by the time I went to the restaurant and slide to confirm the order, I realised that there was a large coffee in it, and it was two bags, the first one is the snacks and cakes and the second one was just coffee.

I don't even know what to do, the road was really slippery and I slid multiple times trying to brake. I could carry it with one hand, but I'm not sure if I can even bike like that in these weather conditions, and if I do, the rain would just make holes in the paper bag anyway, so I decided to do it anyway, I put the coffee and a heavier bag on top of the bag with coffee.

And of course, it spilt, I was having a panic attack in front of the customer's house, he came out and calmed me down, saying it will be alright, but I'm still very shaken by all of this. I already have three thumbs down (and one from a restaurant) due to extremely unlucky circumstances, and saying 'unlucky' would be an understatement. There isn't a single week that goes normally without any trouble, there just seems to be trouble and problems following me everywhere.

I feel really bad about the third unjustified customer's thumbs down, and now I feel even worse. I think I did my job decently until any order with coffee comes in, I feel so hopeless right now, I don't even know if the customer will give a thumbs down or not, because there was another customer who said 'don't worry about it' and proceed to give me thumbs down anyway. I'm not sure if my account will be alright within the following hours.

I can't find any job, I'm anxiety-ridden, and I'm autistic. Delivering food is my only way to survive, and I can't find any alternatives at all. I can't drive, and I don't even have any money to buy a car. I don't know what to do, is there any future for me? Every job and everything is so stressful.

I kind of want to decline any orders from a cafe, but Uber never tells you which order has hot drinks and which order has iced drinks (it just say 'order has drinks,' I'm based in Australia and it might be different anywhere else), because usually, iced drinks are properly sealed, but any hot drink will spill all over the place the moment I hit even the tiniest bump on the street. 

I would normally say, 'From now on, I will not accept any orders from a cafe whatsoever, and I will unassign myself if the order ends up having a coffee in it.' But I'm not even sure if there is even 'from now on.' Any hope for my future has all been lost.

I’m not sure if it’s something I picked up from my family growing up or just some specific etiquette neurons misfiring—when I think it all the way through it seems rude (I think?) but there’s just something in me that defaults to thinking it’s polite. My sibling and I both struggled with ridiculously bad social anxiety as kids so I was always thankful when people ordered for me, and in a family setting it’s common for us to have one person (usually my mom) act as sort of a liaison between all of us and the server just for efficiency’s sake, especially when we’re all sharing food. Anyway, my wife absolutely hates it when I order for them. Fwiw, we are lesbians (and they’re butcher than me) so it’s not gendered, there’s just something deeply ingrained in my brain that it’s actually a polite gesture and efficient for the server, especially when we’re planning to split everything and have agreed on what to get. The most egregious one was when they had been planning to order a salad and without a thought in my brain I ordered an entree for myself and a salad for my wife—I was completely oblivious to why the waitress seemed so disgusted with me until my wife confronted me in the car later and I was HORRIFIED. Is it ever actually polite to do that? Thinking about it from the outside, I can’t imagine a situation other than a family-style dinner where that would be appropriate, so I don’t know why I keep defaulting to that. Separately, is it polite (or less impolite?) to do this when ordering together in a line (coffee shop, ice cream, etc.) if you’re the one paying?
