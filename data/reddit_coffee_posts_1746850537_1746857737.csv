i feel like im being tortured alive & theres no way out. ive tried so many different medications & nothing works. i just want a break, at least one day out of the week to feel normal, have a cup of coffee & leave my house to talk with people. even before i got sick i used to just hide away, work overnight jobs & abuse drugs & self isolate.

maybe it was the drugs that caused it, now im seeing a therapist who says its trauma that is causing it but it just doesn‚Äôt make sense considering the onset of the symptoms after a severe immune response & ever since that night my body doesnt feel like mine anymore. you would think after 4 years u would get used to it but u dont.

i want to disappear. sometimes i think i died & this past 4 years have been a sort of purgatory or parallel universe. ive had bad overdoses & close calls where i almost got into car accidents & think maybe i did die & im in my judgement place or purgatory or whatever & im trying to redeem myself or getting tested by God maybe. this is just me theorizing im not insane, im still very grounded but just desperate for answers & open to anything.

im scared to tell my therapist a lot of this because i will jusy get baker act, they dont care to help me.
im still somewhat young, under 30, but feel like my 20s are being robbed from me. 

the small amount of friends i still do have rarely talk to me anymore cause they probably think i am the crazy hypochondriac friend who lost his mind (which is honestly understandable, i would feel the same way) that & i can barely leave the house so i talk to them occasionally on discord

i miss some of my old friends from school & even rehab. someone to be vulnerable with, cry, talk to, hell just even be in the room with me. this isolation really is the cherry on top to feeling horrible.

i hate my body, i hate this situation, i hate that the doctors can‚Äôt figure it out, i hate that people think its all in my head. thanks if anyone even read this shit, and if anyone has any advice cuz i have nothing left i lost everything.",1,1746857536.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

It runs for 2.5 hours‚Äîlike a movie, but with more drama, fewer explosions, and a lot more arguing over who the killer is.

What makes it different?

* Way more player interaction, way less reading like you're prepping for a school play.
* Smooth, natural English‚Äîno awkward phrasing or Google Translate energy.
* Fully localized to feel like something made *for* an English-speaking audience, not just translated.

This month, *Usher‚Äôs Nightmare Tale* and *The Dragon Slayer* are officially launching across the West Coast‚ÄîBay Area, Los Angeles, and San Diego.

I‚Äôve come to an interesting observation‚Äîthe first few times in the loop were completely unconscious, but going back, the pattern has been the same every time.

Analysing such periods of my personal experience‚Äîthe perpetrator appears to actually be Te‚Äîthe most stubborn bastard there is, I swear (Ti-doms can say they‚Äôre stubbornness personified, and I'd let them ‚Äúwin‚Äù the argument every time rather than waste precious time, but they have no clue about the Te-ride once Ni or Fi decides that the effort is worth it on the personal scale). 

So, Te up and goes in some sort of existential crisis (likely after something absolutely illogical/uncontrollable/unstrategizeable occurred), that no amount of logic can alleviate. It digs its heels stubbornly in the ground, saying ‚ÄúYou guys fix it by yourselves for once‚Äù‚Äîrather than Ni-Fi taking the rains on their own accord.

If I continue with the metaphor; Ni and Fi decide they split the load, and rotate each morning‚Äîthey wake up, make coffee for themselves and then for Te, and start trying to get it out of its hibernation. Ni senses it‚Äôs a pointless endeavor because it is not yet time, but still tries to manipulate Te with grand visions of the distant future. It doesn‚Äôt really work. Fi tries to appeal to Te with valorous promises how grand its return to form would be once it awakens. It really really doesn‚Äôt work.

After multiple attempts, Ni and Fi‚Äîhaving their third coffee and in a random conversation‚Äîstumble upon a rabbit hole they really *want* to explore, doesn‚Äôt matter that it lacks any clarity of purpose or direct implementation. They say ef it, and several insomnia-induced \[insert days/weeks/months\] later, Ni and Fi are still making sure Te stays hydrated, but have thrown any attempts to shake it out of its slumber out the window, binging on said rabbit hole.

Meanwhile, Se is laughing at them all, and on the occasion it gets bored/annoyed, it gets them drunk in order to at least get them to sleep.

Te only rises from its hibernation if someone else‚Äôs Se or Ne drags it out and leaves it no other options.

For the last few months I‚Äôve essentially had a headache the never goes away. It‚Äôs a tingling and pulsating sensation localized to the left side of my face. It traces from cheek/under eye area all the way to left temple area

I‚Äôve gotten bloodwork done and everything is within normal ranges yet this headache seems to come with low energy and disrupts cognitive function. 

The severity varies. On days when it‚Äôs less apparent, I visibly look younger and more vibrant. While other days I look completely depleted and could sleep all day. Sounds crazy I know. But even my partner has commented on the visible fluctuations in my appearance. I also notice my nervous system seems to be overly active despite no external stressors. 

I have a healthy lifestyle, no smoking or alcohol and am active every day. I have become hypersensitive to supplements and even my morning coffee. 

When I‚Äôm on a ketogenic diet it improves significantly. 

A few symptoms that made me think structural blockage were - vascularity in the left side of my face is very apparent in comparison to the right side. Also localized hyper pigmentation on the left side as well with none on the right side, I also have a burst blood vessel under my left eye that has been there for about a year or 2. 

Finally I went to an Osteopath and he showed me how the various muscles on the left side of  my mouth were severely tied up in knots compared to the right. He mentioned he sees some wear on my teeth and thinks bruxism is the root of this problem. About 20 years ago I had a dentist tell me I grind my teeth at night but I thought I had stopped. my partner confirms she never sees or hears me doing so in my sleep. The osteopathic treatments have helped temporarily but after a few days the headache returns.

I have had very mild success in with gua sha scraping to relieve some symptoms. Previous dental history is good. When I was about 13 years old I had a coating put on my teeth. And until 1.5 years ago I had never had a filling. 2 small ones were put in at that time. 

I‚Äôm at my wits end trying to get to the bottom of this. Have documented all my symptoms and daily updates into AI. Everytime I think I have solved the issue it shows to only be a temporary bandaid. It‚Äôs another month before I can get into the dentist so I‚Äôm debating if I should get an MRI before that. Any insight would be appreciated. Thank you. ",1,1746856865.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

INT. DESTINY ‚Äì CONTROL INTERFACE ROOM



Lights flicker across consoles. The hum of the ship is distant but present. The crew stands in tense silence as the Stargate powers up for the first time in months.



GREER (tense)

That's not us. The gate just... activated.



RUSH (stepping forward)

No incoming wormhole from any system we‚Äôve scouted.



CHLOE (softly)

It's Earth.



BRODY

What?! That‚Äôs impossible. We‚Äôre still five hundred years out of sync.



VOLKER

Unless they‚Äôve been trying to reach us all this time... and finally figured it out.



The Stargate stabilizes. A voice comes through, garbled at first, then clearer. It‚Äôs not a person they know ‚Äî it‚Äôs younger, confident, and calm.



EARTH VOICE (V.O.)

...Destiny. This is the Earth Gatebridge Network Command. Resupply in progress. Please stand by.



YOUNG (staring at the wormhole)

We‚Äôve got a connection.



CUT TO: INT. GATE ROOM ‚Äî SHORT MONTAGE



Sealed containers begin arriving. Some are marked clearly: ‚ÄúFOOD ‚Äì HYDROPONIC.‚Äù Others are labeled with unfamiliar logos and strange glyphs. A few are unmarked entirely.



Clothing bundles. Water purification systems. A crate that hums faintly with latent power. Weapons ‚Äî sleek, modular, and unreadable. The crew works quickly to unload, confused, overwhelmed, amazed.



The mood is surreal. Some crew members are smiling. Others are frozen. Hope has returned ‚Äî too suddenly.



RUSH (off to the side, scanning a container with a pad)

They‚Äôve sent us things we can‚Äôt even identify. It‚Äôs like they tried to give us everything... and nothing makes sense yet.



YOUNG

Prioritize food and anything we can adapt now. I want a full inventory started. And‚Äî (beat) keep eyes on that gate.



Suddenly, Destiny‚Äôs lights flicker. A low harmonic tone rumbles under the floor.



THETA (V.O., monotone)

Course correction initiated.



BRODY

What the hell?



EXT. SPACE ‚Äì DESTINY



The ship‚Äôs engines flare to life. The Stargate shuts down mid-transfer. A crate is caught halfway ‚Äî sliced by the wormhole just before collapse.



INT. GATE ROOM



CHLOE

She‚Äôs jumping... Theta‚Äôs taking us into FTL.



YOUNG (furious)

Why now?!



Cut to black.



ACT 1

INT. DESTINY ‚Äì GATEROOM



YOUNG slams a hand on the control panel. Everyone around him is frozen ‚Äî the wormhole‚Äôs gone, the supplies are half-unpacked.



YOUNG

We had contact. We had a line back home.



RUSH (quietly)

And Theta decided we didn‚Äôt need it.



ELI (arriving fast)

I was running diagnostics ‚Äî she rerouted core power to the FTL drive before the gate even shut down. It was deliberate.



BRODY

Deliberate or... reactive? Could she have detected something we didn‚Äôt?



ILINAR (off-panel)

No.



Everyone turns. ILINAR enters from an upper corridor. He looks calm, almost too calm ‚Äî his tone carries weight.



ILINAR (cont‚Äôd)

Theta saw no threat. She responded to something else. A trajectory embedded in her core directives.



VOLKER

So this is another override?



ILINAR

No. She believed she was following purpose.



YOUNG

How do you know that?



ILINAR (pauses, eyes flicker with remembered memory)

Because I helped design that directive.



Beat of silence. The crew exchanges glances. They know Ilinar built Destiny before he ascended. He is slowly recalling more.



RUSH (stepping toward him)

And what is that purpose?



ILINAR (cryptic)

That... is still coming back to me.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì MESS HALL



The crew gathers. Food has been distributed. New clothing and strange devices are laid out on tables. Laughter and lightness return ‚Äî temporarily.



CHLOE (to Eli)

Do you think they knew we were alive this whole time?



ELI

I think they hoped.



VOLKER

These weapons... we don‚Äôt even know how to activate them.



BRODY

We‚Äôll figure it out. Eventually. It‚Äôs like being handed an alien Swiss Army knife with the instructions in Ancient-Kanji.



GREER (testing one of the modular rifle-like objects)

We‚Äôll figure it out faster if we don‚Äôt blow our faces off.



ILINAR (softly, from across the table)

Some of it I remember. The energy systems, the interface harmonics. Give me time.



CHLOE (looks at him)

It‚Äôs coming back to you, isn‚Äôt it?



ILINAR (nods)

Piece by piece. Like walking through your childhood home with all the furniture missing.



YOUNG (arriving late, focused)

We‚Äôre not done. We just lost the line to Earth and we don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs coming back. From this moment forward, we work in shifts to decode what they sent us. Start with food, water systems, and anything we can weaponize if we have to.



RUSH

And what about Theta?



YOUNG (grim)

We talk later. Right now, we learn everything we can.



ACT 3



EXT. SPACE ‚Äì DESTINY SKIMMING A SUN



Destiny rides the edge of a brilliant stellar corona. Solar plasma flows across its energy collectors, the hull groaning faintly as intense radiation is converted into raw power.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì ENGINEERING



Lights are still inconsistent. Power flickers in certain sections. Brody, Volker, and Eli work over exposed conduits, tools and parts scattered.



BRODY

We‚Äôre not back to full strength, but this is the best shape Destiny's been in since before we went into stasis.



VOLKER

And that was centuries ago ‚Äî for Earth, anyway.



ELI

We‚Äôve still got degraded power regulators. Storage capacity‚Äôs shot. But we‚Äôve got enough juice now to start real repairs.



RUSH (entering, holding a pad)

Shields first. If we‚Äôre going to move through more of this ship or face anything else out there, we need to re-establish our defensive lattice.



BRODY

Already patching it. We can stabilize the primary emitters with the reserves from the star. Might even be able to restore the forward shield.



ELI

Theta planned this stop. It routed us past the sun. It knew what we‚Äôd need.



RUSH

It always knows just a little more than we do.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì SHIELD CONTROL ROOM



Ilinar is quietly working at a console‚Äîdamaged but still partially responsive. He carefully inserts a crystal etched with Ancient markings.



ILINAR (quietly)

I designed this interface‚Ä¶ We calibrated it for solar refueling cycles.



As the glyphs ignite, schematics scroll rapidly.



ILINAR

It‚Äôs not all gone. My mind‚Äôs... catching up. I remember what it felt like to be part of this. To build it.



He glances around, more confident now.



ILINAR

I‚Äôm not ascended anymore. But I can still help.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì MESS AREA



The crew is gathered. A new crate has been pried open‚Äîclothing, sealed rations, unfamiliar tools, and tech scattered across the tables.



CHLOE

Some of this is so advanced we don‚Äôt even know what it does.



YOUNG

That makes it dangerous. But we‚Äôll take what we can get. We‚Äôve been surviving on ingenuity.



GREER (holding a sleek weapon-like device)

Let‚Äôs hope this thing‚Äôs on our side.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì BRIDGE



The bridge glows with pale gold from solar collection. Theta is silent now‚Äîno projections, no voice.



RUSH (scanning logs)

Long-range stellar navigation shows Theta‚Äôs been tracking this sun for... decades. This wasn‚Äôt a detour. It‚Äôs part of something larger.



ELI

You think it knew we‚Äôd need this exact moment?



RUSH

No. I think it‚Äôs guiding us toward something we‚Äôre not ready to understand.



EXT. SPACE ‚Äì THE OBSERVER SHIP WATCHES FROM AFAR



Now visible as Destiny slows at the edge of the star system‚Äîa dark, ethereal shape remains just out of range. It does not act. It watches.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì OBSERVATION DECK



Greer, Chloe, and Young look out. A soft, slow hum resonates in the ship as systems stabilize just enough.



CHLOE

We‚Äôre not alone anymore. And I don‚Äôt mean Earth.



YOUNG

As long as we‚Äôre moving forward, we‚Äôre still in the fight.



GREER

Let‚Äôs just hope this time, the ship‚Äôs on our side.



Cut to the slow glow of reactivating shields, energy pulsing through the hull.



FADE OUT.



ACT 4

INT. DESTINY ‚Äì CONTROL ROOM



Lights remain dim but steadier. Core systems are damaged but stabilizing. Repair crews rotate through stations. There‚Äôs tension ‚Äî progress, but slow and uncertain.



Eli works through a tangled diagnostic display. Volker is nearby with a schematic pulled up on a secondary screen.



Eli

(sighs)

Shields are holding for now. With the power from the refueling, we can push repairs a bit further ‚Äî maybe even bring auxiliary sensors back online.



Volker

Yeah, but the power reserves aren‚Äôt infinite. This is still patchwork. If we hit anything serious again...



Eli

We‚Äôll improvise. Like always.



Ilinar enters, reviewing data on a tablet. His tone is quieter, more observational than speculative.



Ilinar

The systems are... adjusting. More quickly than they should. Core routines are adapting around the damage, prioritizing unfamiliar protocols.



Eli

(wary)

So, what ‚Äî the ship‚Äôs repairing itself?



Ilinar

Not exactly. It‚Äôs not healing ‚Äî it's... learning. Responding faster. Like it‚Äôs evolving to meet current needs.



Volker

That‚Äôs not exactly comforting.



Ilinar

It might be the opposite. If it‚Äôs adapting to us, we need to keep up. Or get out of its way.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì STORAGE ROOM



The crew is organizing the last of the Earth-sent supplies. Crates are open, revealing practical necessities and unexplained devices. The mood is mixed: relief, awe, and frustration.



Brody

(holding up a sealed pack of clothes)

Finally. No more patching socks with wire insulation.



Greer

(chuckling)

Speak for yourself. I made that look good.



Volker

(examining a sleek, glowing device)

We got tech here I can‚Äôt even describe, let alone power on.



Chloe

Some of this might be for systems we don‚Äôt even use anymore.



Young

Catalog it. Everything. We‚Äôll figure it out piece by piece.



He moves to the next crate, opens it ‚Äî strange tools and compact weapon systems, clearly far beyond their current understanding.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì ENGINEERING BAY



Eli and Ilinar work in tandem on shield calibrations. Sparks flash as panels are reconnected. The hull‚Äôs inner vibration feels steadier now.



Eli

Shields are climbing ‚Äî 42% and stable. Still not battle-ready, but we could take a few hits.



Ilinar

Better than before. We can start reaching sealed sections again. A full deck survey might even be possible soon.



Eli

And what then? We unlock more broken doors, find another AI in a wall?



Ilinar

If the ship‚Äôs opening up, it wants us to see. That‚Äôs not nothing.



Eli

(half-smiles)

You‚Äôre sounding a lot more like Rush every day.



Ilinar

I remember enough of him to know when not to go that far.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì BREAK ROOM



Crew sits quietly, eating real food for the first time in a long while. Coffee steams. Laughter bubbles up in short bursts, the tension softening.



Chloe

(holding a mug, smiling faintly)

I forgot what this even tasted like.



Brody

I forgot what hope tasted like.



Young

Enjoy it. Who knows how long it‚Äôll last.



A beat. They all know he‚Äôs right, but no one wants to say it out loud.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì OUTER CORRIDORS



Theta remains silent. Consoles glow faintly with unfamiliar icons. As the crew walks by, some systems seem to pulse in sync with their movement ‚Äî subtle, nearly imperceptible.



Chloe

(quietly, to Young)

The ship‚Äôs different now. Feels different.



Young

It‚Äôs still Theta running things. But yeah. It‚Äôs... changing. So are we.



END OF ACT 4



ACT 5

INT. DESTINY ‚Äì MESS HALL ‚Äì NIGHT



Dim lights. Low murmur of voices. The crew shares a rare, quiet meal. Real food from the Earth resupply. New clothes. Steam rising from hot mugs. Laughter tries to return.



GREER

(grinning)

I don‚Äôt care where it came from. Tastes like home.



CHLOE

(softly, holding a cup, distant)

It‚Äôs not just the food. Everything‚Äôs‚Ä¶ different. Like the air feels thicker somehow.



ELI

(nods)

Pressure stabilized a little. Still a long way from comfortable, but Theta‚Äôs rebalanced the systems just enough to move the needle.



RUSH enters, weathered and focused, reading a datapad.



RUSH

Life support‚Äôs holding. Just. Shields are next. We finally have enough stored charge to begin work on the mid-deck emitters. Assuming no new surprises.



VOLKER

(sarcastic)

No surprises? On this ship?



They share a quiet laugh ‚Äî the first honest one in days.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì STASIS POD BAY ‚Äì LATER



Brody and Volker stand near Emissary 9, now secured and isolated in a sealed alcove. Ilinar joins them, arms folded, calm but alert.



BRODY

We still can‚Äôt access the interior. It‚Äôs sealed tighter than the core vaults.



VOLKER

No seams. No power signature. Not even a surface molecular structure I recognize.



ILINAR

(staring at it)

It‚Äôs not just advanced. It‚Äôs different. As if it wasn‚Äôt made‚Ä¶ only grown.



BRODY

(skeptical)

What does that even mean?



ILINAR

Something about it feels familiar. Not from memory ‚Äî from rhythm. Form. As though I should know it, but the language is just out of reach.



VOLKER

We‚Äôre gonna need more than rhythm to crack this thing.



The camera lingers on Emissary 9 ‚Äî silent, unmoving, unreadable.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì ENGINEERING HUB



New crates sit half-unopened. Some tech glows faintly, its purpose unclear. Eli scans something with a hand-held interface, confused and amazed.



ELI

(to himself)

We asked for parts. They sent‚Ä¶ puzzles.



He glances to a half-disassembled shield conduit.



ELI (CONT'D)

One thing at a time.



He plugs in a circuit enhancer. Sparks fly. The hum deepens.



RUSH (O.S.)

Careful. That‚Äôs not calibrated for this system.



Rush walks in, watching closely.



ELI

I know. But I think I can coax it to stabilize the shield grid. Temporarily.



RUSH

(quiet, impressed)

Then coax away.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì CORRIDORS



Chloe walks alone. The halls are dim, pulsing faintly with residual power. The hum of FTL subtly deepens. She pauses near an interface panel that flickers to life as she approaches ‚Äî uncommanded.



She doesn‚Äôt touch it. Just watches.



CHLOE

(quietly)

You're listening, aren‚Äôt you.



The panel dims again. She moves on.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì OBSERVATION DECK



Greer, Young, and Ilinar stand in the dark, gazing at the tunnel of stars stretching ahead in FTL. No words. Just the vast, endless journey ahead.



YOUNG

We‚Äôve been alone a long time.

(pauses)

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if we ever weren‚Äôt.



ILINAR

(softly)

The ship is not what it was. And neither are we.



GREER

So what now?



ILINAR

Now‚Ä¶ we begin to understand.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì SHIELD CONTROL ROOM ‚Äì LATER



Eli, Rush, and Brody work in near silence, fingers moving across consoles. Sparks. Systems flicker. The shield grid is partially restoring. It's fragile ‚Äî but it‚Äôs working.



The ship feels just a little more alive.



INT. DESTINY ‚Äì EMISSARY 9 CHAMBER ‚Äì FINAL SCENE



Ilinar returns alone. Emissary 9 sits in the quiet chamber. He steps close.



ILINAR

(whispers)

You're not done yet, are you?



No response. Just silence. The faint glow inside the device pulses once ‚Äî barely visible.



CUT TO BLACK.

1kj36cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FathersJourney/comments/1kj36cq/my_lunch_with_blanche/,My lunch with Blanche,"*Dotty and I spent a couple of hours in the gazebo tonight talking through my day.¬† I told her everything that happened, everything that was said.¬† She‚Äôs a strong woman, Dot, but she‚Äôs careful.¬† I wish she weren‚Äôt so careful right now ‚Äì I wish she would provoke me, but it‚Äôs complicated.¬† For now, I‚Äôll just type out the words in my head because that‚Äôs how my mind works and it's what I need to do.¬† I‚Äôll revert to the very charter of this sub by rambling without pause and I‚Äôll give it to you.¬† And when I‚Äôm done, I know I‚Äôll feel better.*¬†¬†¬†

It was a weird day.

I haven‚Äôt spoken of my mother-in-law (the Pelican) for quite a long time and that‚Äôs largely because of the separation I applied after the worst of it.¬†¬†Many here will recall the hell she and her daughter put us through after Suzie died; the pilfering, the lies.¬†¬†How they sought to divide me from my sons.¬†

Well, I should confess that it hasn‚Äôt been complete radio silence.¬†¬†In fact, I reach out once a month with an email of updates on the boys.¬† Anymore, if they reply at all, it‚Äôs down to a simple ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know, maybe I think too much.¬† But I‚Äôve said from the very start that I want so badly for my sons to have their family.¬† And I want their family to have my sons.

I sent pictures of PJ at the event, when he won the writing contest, though I didn‚Äôt share his entry.¬†¬†Days later, my mother-in-law would reply, not with a simple thank you, but with pages of regret and longing ‚Äì it was a lot to read and it was unexpected and it was raw.

I read her words, though not stoically.¬†¬†I read them with the ten thousand memories that I‚Äôve kept all the while.¬†¬†I wasn‚Äôt presuming her tone; I‚Äôve learned not to do that.¬†¬†Instead, I simply listened to what she said.¬†

It was a long time between hitting reply and typing.¬†¬†I had a lot of thoughts.¬†¬†Then, finally, I wrote, ‚ÄúWill you have lunch with me?‚Äù

Some here might cringe at that, and I understand.¬†¬†After all, I brought you through the nightmare with me then, as it happened, while I was slow to learn.¬†¬†Some may recall my melt-down and the night of broken dishes.¬†¬†There isn‚Äôt much love for the in-laws here and I know that.¬†¬†But what has stayed with me all along is the fact that they are a part of her; a part of my sons.¬†¬†And that has to matter.

This was not an easy decision.

I was intentionally late for our reservation, going so far as to drive a few exits past the restaurant.¬†¬†It wasn‚Äôt a power-play, I don‚Äôt subscribe to that sort of thing.¬†¬†I don‚Äôt know why I did it.

She had her back to me when I stepped up to the table.¬†¬†It was a weird moment.¬†¬†She was a stranger to me.

‚ÄúHello, Blanche.‚Äù

My voice seemed to startle her as she turned.¬†¬†When she looked up at me, there was an odd expression of surprise, as if she didn‚Äôt expect me to show.¬†¬†Immediately, she wept, and then clumsily stood to hug me.¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you!‚Äù¬†¬†She said.

After our brief embrace, I took the chair across from her and settled.¬†¬†And I realized, looking at her, that I didn‚Äôt know who to be.¬†¬†A maelstrom of memories flooded through me then, all mixed together ‚Äì the good and the bad ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt peel them apart.¬†You see, I knew the trouble was that I still love this woman.

But Blanche is a game-player ‚Äì she can‚Äôt help it.¬† It‚Äôs just the way she‚Äôs built.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs Deloris?‚Äù would be her first question.

I shook my head and smiled. And for just a moment I wondered to the thoughts in her head, before I stopped myself and returned to the here and now.¬† I wouldn‚Äôt go there.¬† You see, what she mightn‚Äôt have expected is that I‚Äôve graduated from the game ‚Äì I no longer play.¬† So I let out a chuckle.¬† ‚ÄúStarting right off, I see.‚Äù

She sat back the way an innocent wouldn‚Äôt; her posture instantly defensive.¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know Goddamn well her name is Dorothy.‚Äù

She‚Äôs known Dot for 15 years.¬† No‚Ä¶ this was a signal.¬† It was her saying, ‚Äú*She‚Äôs not important to me*.‚Äù

So it wasn‚Äôt a good start.

Dot was the first gorilla at the table and I knew we needed to talk about her.¬† Blanche said a great many things in that long and heartfelt email she wrote, but so much of what was real would be tucked in between the lines; where between the lines is generally where you‚Äôll find her.¬† I knew she was hurt, and I knew she was confused.¬† I know she feels abandoned and I get it.¬† And the thing is‚Ä¶ her feelings were valid and I wanted to listen.

Though she already knows, I reminded her that I didn‚Äôt just run out and remarry.¬† I told her that it wasn‚Äôt about forgetting Suzie and how the day isn‚Äôt coming when that would ever be possible.

She nodded, and when she did, I could see a hint of shame.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been hard‚Ä¶ the separation.‚Äù She said.¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel you anymore.‚Äù¬† She looked right at me then.¬† ‚ÄúSo I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you like me to tell you?‚Äù¬†

Blanche nodded, but in her obvious caution, I knew that she didn‚Äôt want to listen to more than she was capable of hearing.¬† She was fragile.

So for a while we talked about Dot and our marriage.¬† We talked about why we married, what it was like at the start, how it‚Äôs changed.¬† I reminded her how Dotty loved Suzanne; how close they were and how that plays out every day.¬† I spoke of the softness she brings and how much the boys need her.¬† I promised her that she wasn‚Äôt a replacement, and how much their mother still lives in us.

Blanche seemed to accept my words when she nodded.  I knew that it was impossibly hard for her when I remarried and until this moment, we hadn't talked about it.  We hadn't talked at all.  ‚ÄúYou were a son to me, Mack.‚Äù She said, but right away, her face soured as she waived her hand, as if shooing the unpleasant memories.¬† ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs not about the ugliness that went on; it‚Äôs much simpler than that.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù

She reminded me that she lost her darling daughter ‚Äì her treasure.¬† And then she lost me.

I knew she was fragile, but Blanche will be Blanche, and I‚Äôm not the same person I was then.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bullshit and you know it.‚Äù I told her.

I wasn‚Äôt biting at the shiny lure this time and it isn‚Äôt that I‚Äôve grown cold.¬† I‚Äôm just wiser than before.

I was stern and frank when I reminded her that she didn‚Äôt lose me, and that, in fact, she pushed me out of her life.¬† I reminded her that she destroyed trust, that she stole from my children; manipulated them.¬† I told her how her march though our house on the day of the funeral, taking everything that wasn‚Äôt nailed down made me feel as if I was nobody.¬† I didn't hold back.

‚ÄúI wanted everything I could have of her.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúI just wanted anything that would remind her of her.‚Äù

I briefly lost my calm. ‚ÄúSo did her sons!‚Äù

Some heads turned at my outburst and I was embarrassed.¬† I didn‚Äôt count the beats of silence that followed, but there were many.¬†

Finally, Blanche would put her hand on my forearm and ask if I would listen.¬† I told her I would.¬† And then she talked to me, explained and shared her thinking.

Part of what I do for a living is to separate lies from truth and I‚Äôm very good at it.¬† As Blanche spoke, I believed her.¬† I believed every word.¬† For you see, they weren‚Äôt pretty, her words, they weren‚Äôt in defense and they wouldn‚Äôt absolve her.¬† But they were real.

She loved me from the start and she told me she still does.¬† But she‚Äôs always resented me.¬† ‚ÄúIt started when you were dating,‚Äù she explained.¬† She told me that Suzie fell so hard, so fast and that she wasn‚Äôt ready.¬† Before she knew it, I was taking her daughter away from her.¬† She would pause for a moment, seemingly ordering her thoughts before she would start again, telling me about her therapist; some woman named Grace, and how she‚Äôs been helpful.¬† This was remarkable if only in the sense that I never expected Blanche to engage in therapy ‚Äì she was always too stubborn.¬† As she continued, though, it was clear that she had.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm deeply insecure, Mack,‚Äù she said.¬†

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt we all?‚Äù I asked, if a bit desperate to level the field.¬† These were, after all, some choppy waters ‚Äì we‚Äôve never talked this way.

Blanche would go on to speak, if briefly, of her own upbringing, so much of which I already knew, but she would go deeper. Her story humbled me.

She admitted that when Suzie died, one of the first things she remembers hearing from her own voice was, ‚ÄúThat son of a bitch!‚Äù

I would nod and tell her I knew, only I wasn‚Äôt sure how.

‚ÄúI blamed you.‚Äù She admitted.¬† ‚ÄúBecause it wouldn‚Äôt have happened if she was home with me.‚Äù¬† Blanche would go on to describe her anger, even if it wasn‚Äôt logical.¬† ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt help it.‚Äù

She told me that she didn‚Äôt want me to have anything, only she didn‚Äôt really understand why.¬† She said she was just so angry that she wanted to take her daughter‚Äôs life back from me.¬†

‚ÄúYou took her from home, far away from me.‚Äù

I reminded her that the farm was her daughter‚Äôs dream, not mine.¬† ‚ÄúYou know that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.¬† But she wouldn‚Äôt have done it without you.‚Äù

She went on to explain the conflict of loving me at the same time, like a son, how well I cared for her, for the family, how happy I made Suzie and how perfectly I loved her and the boys.¬† ‚ÄúThere was nobody better for her and I knew that.‚Äù¬†

Then, for a long moment she just bounced her head, looked up, then down then over.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that it all broke that night.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes it did.‚Äù

‚ÄúI broke that night.‚Äù She said.¬† Then she looked right at me.¬† ‚ÄúAnd you became the enemy.‚Äù

She told about a moment that I didn‚Äôt remember.¬† It was in the immediate of the worst night when she wanted to have PJ with her, and that I told her no.¬† She said it was then that she realized that I was the gatekeeper to her grandsons.¬† She said she knows now that she didn‚Äôt process that well.¬† ‚ÄúIt made it so much worse.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt think of anything to say in response.

It was a long talk, terribly long ‚Äì we kept ordering coffee just to keep the table.¬† It‚Äôs fading now, the details ‚Äì I‚Äôm exhausted.¬† But I remember asking her, ‚ÄúWhat have we learned?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt reply, but it would convey through her expression, and that subtle nod she offered me then.¬†

‚ÄúI never wanted to keep the boys from you; that was never what I wanted to do.‚Äù¬†

She seemed to understand.¬† I told her how they were my only priority and that they were confused at a time when they needed clarity and security and how she wasn‚Äôt offering that.¬† ‚ÄúYou were manipulating them, and you know that‚Äôs true.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I know.‚Äù She said.

I didn‚Äôt expect that ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt expect her to acknowledge that.¬† And I‚Äôll never forget what she said next.¬† She said, ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt you see, I‚Äôve lost everything now.¬† And so I‚Äôll take anything you‚Äôll give me.‚Äù

God‚Ä¶ that killed me.¬†

I don‚Äôt think it was part of any game ‚Äì I knew she meant it.¬† I know she loves them; she misses them.¬† They miss her.

When this was ugly, the boys were younger and vulnerable and things were less settled.¬† The bullshit that flew then is gone now ‚Äì the stupid legal letters and lawsuits over trinkets ‚Äì it‚Äôs over now.¬† She has no cards now.

Dot looked at me tonight and smiled that tranquil smile she gets in such moments of tension.¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre working it out, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù¬† She asked.¬† I told her I was.¬† I told her that maybe we could have a family day and that we could go to a park or do something, the way we used to.¬† I told her that the boys miss them too. I told her that maybe it was time.

I remember posting here about the talk I had with Zach over all of this.¬† And I remember how stressed they made him.¬† And when I told him that I would be stepping between him and this family, he didn‚Äôt fight me, and how terrifically sad that was.¬† Normally, Zach would fight.¬† But they really hurt him.

Warts and all, they do miss them and I know they want it fixed; they want what they had.¬† Maybe it‚Äôs not possible.

It was never bad until it was, but even when it was, the one thing that held true all along was that they dearly cherish the boys and they always will ‚Äì I know that.¬† And if you‚Äôve been with me long enough, you‚Äôll remember the theme, and how badly I wanted my sons to have their family.¬† Yet at the same time, I was correct to lower the curtain on this act of the play and I don‚Äôt regret it.¬† I needed to protect my boys and I did.

But maybe it‚Äôs time.

I‚Äôll talk to Zach and I‚Äôll hear him.¬† And it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm discounting PJ, it‚Äôs just that PJ will do whatever Zach does, and so I‚Äôll talk to Zach first.¬† And I‚Äôll ask him to be honest, and he will be.¬†

We‚Äôll go from there.",1,1746856154.0,FathersJourney,0,1.0,False

1. **Lower appetite**¬†\- I thought this was manageable, but it's now at the point that I've lost more weight than I'm comfortable with, and am not eating enough food most days, and drinking more coffee for energy. I'm trying to make up for it with high density food/smoothies but it's not cutting it.
2. As a result of this, my¬†**energy levels** are really low- I'm¬†**exercising less**¬†(dropped from 3 times a week to maybe once). I‚Äôm feeling physically drained, and my muscles/joints don't feel great with less exercise.
3. I've started to notice that I'm **taking the meds to wake up in the morning** because I'm so tired, which makes it difficult to eat breakfast and starts me off on the wrong foot.
4. I'm now finding it **difficult to sleep**, because it takes me so long to get started in the morning I'm taking meds later in the day, drinking more coffee and exercising less. 

It's a pretty vicious cycle, and I'm having difficulty working out how to break out of it - especially because unmedicated (or just taking a lower does at this point) I'm pretty hopeless at work, study and life admin in general.

I have never been to this area before and it's not like I can just jump into the job markets. Also it was ridiculoued that ""we will raise our rents at any time"" however they just raised it this year.  My old luxury beautiful studio was just $100 more so I am literally in a nightmare upon hearing the vouchers could end this year or next. I found an agreeable beautiful complex with rents under $1200 and I am applying but I have rent arrears and student loans on my credit score. If only I had worked at a dollar store, croissant cafe or sat dogs in my old place to avoid all this!! As I fear eviction any time next year if the voucher ends. The soul embarssment will never recover.  This woman is scary. My apartment is set at 80 or 90% AMI yet I do not make that? Ands sounds no flexibility to even adjust that if next year the voucher ends and I make less. WHy would I be in an apartment for up to $58,000 income, if I make less? Doesn't make sense the subsidized buildings are even going to get people evicted that need the home. The same building has mostly $600 to $950 or so rents but I am on the top tier? The voucher has been assisting I've had fatigue and lung problems after quitting smoking I could not necessarily work a lot and the clothing selling I tried was supposed to make a lot in 6 months it didn't.  Weird thing is, who do you even ask? My Housing Authority is e-mails and then the telephone hotline was disconnected. It is so much stress and time more than working a job howerver I have been so consumed by stress to even walk around and look for jobs !! Woman who runs the place is scary when I renewed all I heard was ""Did you collect unemployment"" from across the room, no I didn't I didn't make enough last summer and came back with coronavirus. It wasn't even like, good morning! So glad you will be with us for another year. The tone shifted. Building has all these glamorous newspaper articles when they opened but the things I've heard from other people living here are beyond what I can comprehend strange. I was looking into STEHP rental assistance but did not get an answer, I am sure I am not in the same boat of worry as many others, is this how long and is this ""to retain permanent housing"" to prevent homelessness? I was before this. I have seen it up to 2 years or 6 months does anyone know? I am just trying to give myself some leeway for finding a job this building evicts after one month and there have been 3 evictions on my floor the place is scary. My small business used to make $2500 a month like it was nothing years ago to be terrified like this is beyond me, I check my emails every day no one writes.

Our panelists are from diverse sectors and will share from their unique viewpoints. Some have finance and business expertise. Some are corporate leaders and entrepreneurs, while another is a missionary on a mission, and they all have something to share. The panel questions will be:

* **What‚Äôs something you wish people would talk about more often?**

1kj310g,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1kj310g/hang_in_there/,Hang in There,"A 4 by 5 cubicle room hangs around silently, waiting for someone to claim the place. A flood of sunlight fills the space, I just hope it can brightens my mood.

Placed on the eleventh floor, I can see the bustling world below. Feeling trapped, but too afraid to escape. Fortunately, I have my green friend sitting in the corner. He watches over me everyday as my fingers dance loudly on an old keyboard.

The squeaky chair is the one who keeps complaining if I sit for too long. Nudging me to stand for a while, so I don‚Äôt hurt my back. I always pick up a book from this pristine wooden shelves beside my desk whenever I want to relax for a while. For me, reading a book makes me feel as if I‚Äôm anywhere but here.

I don‚Äôt know why I keep coming back. Maybe it‚Äôs this lingering smell of freshly-brewed coffee that makes me rethink my decisions.

This company is part of the reasons why my psychologist can go overseas once in a month. Sometimes, the pressure I get from my boss seems higher than the Mariana Trench. Despite all that, this is a place where I can grow. To learn that there is more to life than just having fun. I guess, I‚Äôm willing to live that life.",1,1746855537.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

1kj30d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1kj30d2/so_i_want_to_be_civil_and_just_want_everyone_to/,"So, I want to be civil, and just want everyone to know, that my passion in this is because I care. I just saw a post‚Ä¶ about a medication for *idiopathic* hypersomnia‚Ä¶ I was once diagnosed with this and CFS and so many other things‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs my response:","***TL;DR: My Response to a Post About Idiopathic Hypersomnia Medication

I'm frustrated seeing medications marketed for ""idiopathic"" conditions without addressing root causes. As someone misdiagnosed multiple times before discovering I had panhypopituitarism, I understand the struggle of living with unexplained symptoms while doctors prescribe bandaid solutions.

For those suffering: Consider getting specific blood tests (ACTH, Cortisol, TSH, FreeT4) without stimulants beforehand. Low ACTH with low cortisol suggests pituitary issues; normal ACTH with low cortisol indicates potentially deadly adrenal problems.

If testing isn't accessible, practice meditation and self-advocacy. Find supportive people and remove toxic influences. As someone who experienced menopause at 19 due to an undiagnosed condition, I'm committed to advocating for those whose legitimate medical issues are dismissed as psychological. You deserve proper diagnosis and treatment, not just symptom management.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã***


If any of you can still fight, this is what I wanted to comment below for this community, but that company has all comments disabled. For those without answers, likely those on this subreddit, listen in: 

If I could respond to a company like this one, I‚Äôd say‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYeah, and guess what why mine was? Not this but still diagnosed as this‚Ä¶ I was put on all of these medications that tried to make it seem like it was a mental health issue‚Ä¶ when I repeatedly described that these symptoms felt like NyQuil‚Ä¶

Idiopathic BLANK is still an undiagnosed illness. Idiopathic means an unknown cause. Stop finding bandaid solutions for people who are undiagnosed‚Äî especially the CFS community. I was 19 and went through menopause because of panhypopituitarism. I‚Äôve always had it and worsened as I aged after puberty. BE BETTER. Stop promoting things like this and put your research into actually helping this community of people who truly suffer every single day of their lives‚Ä¶ do you know what it‚Äôs like to not be able to explain to peope why you are sick but feel sick every. single. day? Most people by the time they actually do something about this are too late in their illness or life to dedicate all their limited 5% battery to research and ask the questions and know how to navigate this system or afford do  so. They have no background or energy or ability to realize this is happening and to research and fight with every bit of their being like I did‚Ä¶ so much that it tricked people into thinking I was fine because I channeled my energy into these appointments‚Ä¶ I had time to research‚Ä¶ I am a scholar with research‚Ä¶ I am writer. My degrees are in journalism and marketing, but I love to write and have passions to help others. I‚Äôve been held back because of medicines like this... Even with treatment, my life is behind. I am always needed hydrocortisone. Stop promoting idiopathic medicine for bandaid treatment. Even me‚Äîdiagnosed‚Äîand pumped wifh multiples medications to stay alive but question whether it‚Äôs worth it. They choose not to try to fix it. Stop being these people. And for communities like CFS? They have it the worst of them all. I don‚Äôt care. They live a life in an idiopathic illness ignored and untreated. It‚Äôs a sad life. A lonely life. This? This is another medicine that will mess up their hormones more depending on what your adding or blocking. Find a way to fix people with adrenal fatigue from an undiagnosed and hard to diagnose adrenal condition. I was lucky to be in Minnesota for college. I pushed for it at Mayo in Rochester. A special test was required called an ITT. People don‚Äôt understand that even epinephrine is needed‚Ä¶ we live without this due to no hormone being made for people like me and is not having epinephrine other than EpiPens. We can‚Äôt do that daily. BE BETTER. Just be freaking better. These people cant even fight. They‚Äôve lost their automony. They are hoping for a miracle, which is supposed to be you. Find the underlying causes ‚Äúscientists‚Äù. Ask the right questions. Observe people of all ages and then ask yourself if this was your child‚Ä¶ with all their hopes and dreams left unfulfilled‚Ä¶ how would you feel? Be BETTER.‚Äù

For those out there with a partner or anyone who wants you better just as much as your do, I recommend you get a simple morning blood draw to check your ACTH, Cortsol, TSH vs FreeT4 (BOTH), and neuro hormones if possible like dopamine, serotonin (if possible - there are other names), epinephrine, non-epinephrine), no coffee, no stimulants like adderall for 3 days, get the test‚Ä¶ sleep. If your acth is low with the cortisol, that‚Äôs a sign you may need your pituitary checked like I did (even if they say they have - like me - tell them NO, again! But have an advocate to that so your not blamed or mistreated like I was)‚Ä¶ if you have normal ACTH (up to 60) and low cortisol, th is is an adrenal issue and deadly. 

For those out there who can‚Äôt do this, meditate. It sounds silly, but listen to your body and mind. Ideas pop in there. Religious or spiritual‚Ä¶ or maybe you aren‚Äôt either, just try. The sleepier the easier it is to be in that state of complete calm but try to focus on the meditation. Listen to your body. Your toes to your head‚Ä¶ listen to every part. Keep doing this. Imagine‚Ä¶ like a child would‚Ä¶ that you have magical powers and can send bright beautiful light to your body. It sounds silly? And maybe you don‚Äôt have to believe it‚Äôs the other side, but guess what? Your mind is also very powerful. Do this every day. Slowly‚Ä¶ every month‚Ä¶ set a goal. Routine should be the first. Even if that‚Äôs just making a bed and sitting on top with a blanket. Remove the TV from the room. Guys, I wish I could go back‚Ä¶ and just know what I know now. I know I sound like a wild & odd person, but I legitimately care about this community so much that I can‚Äôt even come on here because I was you. And I a lot of the time still when I‚Äôm not on top of things because I haven‚Äôt had time to find someone because life is hard and stress is worse, but listen to me‚Ä¶ you can do it. I want to help people like you with my obviously loud voice and willingness to speak up‚Ä¶ even if it gets me in so much trouble. This is the worst thing‚Ä¶ and I want you all better. It could be so many things, but doctors don‚Äôt have time to dive into research much‚Ä¶ especially for one patient. You often need to find someone to do that for you. A third party‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs dreadful. You deserve the best. And I hope this helps someone out there‚Ä¶ I do‚Ä¶ I really do. I believe in you. Believe in yourself and know that people in this world are fighting for you. People I will make it my life‚Äôs mission to help people undiagnosed like with CFS‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been there and been so alone. No one here for me. Parents that didn‚Äôt believe me. I was going through menopause, hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, menopause (terrible night sweats, hot flashes, etc), and so much more. I care. I‚Äôve been there and care and still care for people who haven‚Äôt had the same things. I care about people left without a voice. So while this is very loud and out there, I just want you to know that I am an advocate. And I care. And while my life still needs to be on track, I care and will do this with my life and whisper in the right ears and try to make systemic changes for you all. I feel like I can. And I want to. I am passionate about this. About those without a voice. So, have hope. Try to take care of your body. Learn to be kind to yourself, avoid toxic people who disregard you, just be your best friend. You can do it. Make your internal mindset strong enough to change your external world. I believe in you. ü§ç‚ú®ü¶ãü´∂üèΩüåô",0,1746855463.0,cfs,0,0.33,False

Loud music drowned out conversation, although few people were interested in chatting. The beat of the music thumped through Jo‚Äôs brain, and she gritted her teeth against the vibration. Lights flashed on and off. The dance floor housed groups of girls dressed in skimpy clothes. Occasionally, a couple danced into view but weren‚Äôt dancing as much as they made out on the dance floor. What am I doing here? she wondered. Once again, her workmates had played her for a sucker. The girls at work had a girls‚Äô night out, and as Jo wasn‚Äôt a big drinker, she had offered to act as the designated driver. The night had started well, with the group seated at tables together, chatting, laughing, and drinking. For the first time in her working life, she felt like a member of this exclusive group. After their first few drinks, her bubble burst when the girls wandered off, searching for male companions. Jo watched in despair as girl after girl hooked up with a male partner. The girls in her group, who hadn‚Äôt found a partner, moved onto the dance floor to dance together. Jo‚Äôs head was pounding. The club was hot, and she could feel perspiration trickle down her back and pool under her arms. The excess weight she carried meant that she always felt warm, and in this room crowded with feverish bodies and- inadequate air conditioning, it felt like a sauna. She had dressed in a conservative outfit tonight, but nothing looked great when she weighed one hundred and twenty kilos. She cursed herself for being a fool, realising she shouldn‚Äôt have come. Now, it was apparent that these women were not real friends, and they had used her as their taxi home, whenever that might be. Did she have to keep up her part of the bargain, considering the friends who were supposed to hang out together had not upheld their end of the deal? As she looked around, trying to make eye contact with one woman from work, Jo noticed a group of men huddled at a table halfway across the room. Now and then, a man would look over his shoulder and snigger. Gales of laughter followed, and Jo had a good idea of what would come. Her thought proved correct when a man rose and walked towards her. He was an impressive specimen of a man. His designer jeans hugged him tightly, and his crew neck shirt moulded muscles that had probably taken hours at the gym to perfect. Sandy brown hair, styled to display his abundant locks best, topped off a perfect face, all chiselled cheeks and square jaw. This man was way out of Jo‚Äôs league, and his approach must be because one of his friends dared him to chat her up. She had been the butt of cruel jokes before; she recognised that her excessive weight was always why men thought she was fair game. ‚ÄúMay I sit here?‚Äù he asked politely. Jo scrutinised him. ‚ÄúThis is obviously of enormous amusement to your friends. Please don‚Äôt insult my intelligence by pretending to be interested in me. Tell your mates you asked me for a date or whatever their dare was, and leave me in peace.‚Äù The man pressed his hand dramatically against his heart. ‚ÄúYou wound me! I would never be so callous as to make you the butt of a joke. I wanted to chat with your to see why you are sitting alone and not dancing with your friends.‚Äù ‚ÄúI was stupid enough to offer to act as the designated driver, and the others aren‚Äôt friends, more work colleagues.‚Äù ‚ÄúI should introduce myself. I‚Äôm Chase Donaldson, and I work as a sales agent at a BMW dealer in the city.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy name is Josephine Bromley, and I work in town as a manager at a PR firm.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere, that wasn‚Äôt too hard, was it?‚Äù ‚ÄúChase, you appear to be a good man. Why don‚Äôt you chat up one of the other girls more susceptible to your charms? Surely you must have won your bet by now?!‚Äù ‚ÄúJosephine, you are such a doubter. I am not in the middle of a wager and have no dubious motives. Why don‚Äôt we chat and see where it goes?‚Äù Jo looked beyond Chase‚Äôs shoulder; his mates were still glancing over their shoulders and sniggering. ‚ÄúHave a look at your buddies. Their sniggering and covert looks suggest you have some mean prank to pull on me. Your motives aren‚Äôt without purpose.‚Äù While she had been talking with Chase, her workmates had noticed the exchange and drifted over. Suzanne, blond, tall, and voluptuous, sidled up to Chase. ‚ÄúHi, honey. Jo is a bit uptight, but I could give you a good time. Do you want to dance with me?‚Äù Jo knew how this would go; Chase would thank her for the chat and disappear with Suzanne for the rest of the night. Chase raked his gaze over Suzanne‚Äôs breasts and down her waist, paused at her crotch, and slid down her legs. He said, ‚ÄúThanks for the offer, but we are okay here.‚Äù Jo nearly passed out in surprise. Suzanne‚Äôs open mouth and wide eyes attested to her feelings at being turned down. She stomped around and then stalked away from the table. Chase laughed out loud. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she gets many knockbacks. It‚Äôll do her good.‚Äù Jo shook her head in amazement. ‚ÄúYou just turned down Suzanne to sit and talk to me. Are you gay?‚Äù His loud barking laugh startled her. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt pull any punches, do you? No, I am not gay, but I don‚Äôt need sloppy seconds from some woman who‚Äôs had her back against a wall out the back and her dress up around her waist.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you didn‚Äôt come to hook up, why did you come here tonight?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, my friends decided we‚Äôve worked hard all week and needed a break. Speaking of my friends, I should go back and join them. I‚Äôve enjoyed talking to you. Can I call you?‚Äù His question bewildered Jo. ‚ÄúIf you walk back to your friends and they all burst out laughing, I will dump the contents of my water jug on you. Do you understand?‚Äù Chase grinned at her, and butterflies took flight in her stomach; a flush spread up her neck and over her face. She ducked her head. Chase placed a finger under her chin and lifted her face. ‚ÄúThat blush is cute; don‚Äôt hide it from me. Now, Josephine, hand me your phone so I can put my number in it and here‚Äôs my phone; please put your name in the contacts list.‚Äù Once Chase had the number, he handed her the phone and returned to sit with his friends. Jo looked over once or twice, and the mates weren‚Äôt laughing. She caught Chase‚Äôs eye at one stage, and he winked at her, sending the blush straight back up her neck to cover her face. Eventually, her workmates called it a night, and the group departed. Suzanne, who was more than a little inebriated, sneered at her in the car. ‚ÄúThink you‚Äôre smart snagging a hottie tonight? He may have wanted to chat this evening, but he is way out of your league. You‚Äôd best forget him; guys like that don‚Äôt go out with fat chicks like you.‚Äù Jo knew this to be correct, but she wanted to believe that this was real for once. When the phone rang early the next day, Jo considered leaving it to voicemail. She was already running late for work; she didn‚Äôt have time to talk to random marketers or charities begging for funds. With the shrill ring of her phone again, she double-backed and answered the call. ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù ‚ÄúJosephine? It‚Äôs Chase here. Can you talk?‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, good morning, Chase. I‚Äôm running late, so I have little time to talk. Why don‚Äôt you ring me back in an hour?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo need to ring back; meet me at Stratford‚Äôs for coffee at five-thirty?‚Äù Jo laughed. ‚ÄúSure, see you then.‚Äù As she drove to work, Jo was happy. This hot, agreeable man just asked her to meet him for coffee. She tried to concentrate on her new customer information at work but found that Chase‚Äôs handsome face kept intruding. What if this was a joke? He asked her to meet him, but would he come? What if she arrived, and he failed to show? Doubts swirled around in her head as her work took less time and concentration. Jo came up with a solution to her problem. She didn‚Äôt want to sit at the cafe for hours waiting for a no-show. She could ask him if he was at the coffee shop if she arrived late. That way, she wouldn‚Äôt need to put up with pitying looks from the servers when he left her stranded. Before leaving work, Jo ran to the restroom to check her appearance. She headed for the car park with her hair smoothed down and a layer of gloss on her lips. The traffic, as always, was bumper to bumper until she cleared the main thoroughfare and drove along the side streets that led to the cafe. Once she parked, excitement and dread consumed Jo. Would Chase arrive, or would he stand her up? With nerves racing, she stood outside the cafe to look through the window. Chase was not in the room. She backed away; she would wait for five minutes before calling him. As she stood under the porch of a shop across the road, she saw Chase and an attractive blond walk towards the door of the caf√©. The woman reached up and pecked Chase. He pulled her in close and closed his hand over her butt. She laughed and pushed his hand away, and then they parted; he went into the caf√©, and she walked further along the street to the shops. After witnessing the peck between Chase and his girlfriend, Jo did not intend to participate in their scam. She dialled her phone and watched as Chase answered his phone through the window. ‚ÄúJosephine, where are you? I‚Äôm waiting for you at the caf√©.‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, Chase, something has come up. I‚Äôll have to cancel.‚Äù ‚ÄúGreat, I cleared my calendar so we could get together, and now I‚Äôm at a loose end.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll catch up with your girlfriend if you hurry. After that passionate peck, I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs ready for more.‚Äù Chase's response was a string of profanities, and the phone went dead.",1,1746855158.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a man in my mid-40s, about 6‚Äô4‚Äù and weighing around 310 lbs. I don‚Äôt have any major physical health issues beyond smoking, degenerative disc disease, and arthritis. I smoke about a pack a day and have tried to quit multiple times over the years‚ÄîI‚Äôm still trying.

As far as exercise goes, I probably only get about 500 steps a day (just guessing here) since I work 4‚Äì5 days a week as a limo driver and spend most of that time sitting on my ass. My work hours vary from day to day, but I generally work 12‚Äì18 hours within a 24-hour period. Because of my schedule and drive times, I don‚Äôt get much sleep‚Äîusually just 4 to 6 hours a night.

Proper hydration is a challenge too. Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîthere aren‚Äôt many bathroom breaks when you‚Äôre driving clients around, and I can‚Äôt just stop to use the restroom. Most days, I drink a large iced coffee with flavored creamer without adding additional sugar, and that lasts me most of the day. If I have a later start, I‚Äôll have 2‚Äì4 cups of coffee in the morning and maybe something to eat. I‚Äôve tried black coffee before, but it really upsets my stomach.

Now, about my eating habits: because of the nature of my job, I‚Äôm already used to going long stretches without eating. I do have dinner every night, but the timing varies wildly‚Äîit could be anywhere from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. I‚Äôll sometimes eat during the day, but it‚Äôs usually nothing healthy‚Äîmostly fast food or whatever‚Äôs convenient. I have a bad habit of overeating, which I‚Äôm actively working on through portion control and making myself walk away from the table when I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôve mostly cut out soda and am trying to reduce sugar snacks as much as possible‚Äîso that‚Äôs something. Small victories, I guess.

With all that dirty laundry aired out‚Äîwhat are your thoughts and suggestions on where to start and how to regulate things for someone who‚Äôs never done proper fasting before?",1,1746855007.0,fasting,1,1.0,False
1kj2tht,https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA/comments/1kj2tht/does_anyone_else_play_rockstar_games_as_a/,Does anyone else play Rockstar games as a roleplay simulator?,"I've always played Rockstar games as life simulators since GTA IV. I actually try to live the life of the character within the game world. If I'm playing as Niko, I will actually change my clothes every day, try to eat food everyday (Niko doesn't eat 3 meals a day because he's highly depressed) I don't steal cars randomly, I actually use the subway system or Brucie's helicopter/boat pickup and ride from his Friend ability later on in the story. But I'll also walk to the nearest park and pretend to sit on the bench in middle of the night when Niko can't sleep. I'll avoid killing people in missions and use knee shots unless I have to kill people.

I've done the same kind of roleplay in RDR 1&2 as well as GTA V. Like if I'm playing as Micheal, I'll buy a new boat when I can after the first heist and just dive out into the sea to relax or when I'm playing as Arthur in RDR2, I'll make sure to have a cup of coffee in the morning and make sure I eat something 3 times a day. I'll walk into town and get a room and have a bath. I'll respond to NPC's the way I feel like Arthur would depending on the part of the story.

Basically I use my imagination and play these games as if it's another life I'm living as the character I'm playing as.

Does anyone else play these games like I do? ",3,1746854714.0,GTA,0,0.8,False

 Two Months Later  
  
‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù dumbfounded, No√©mie blurted out.   
  
Her eyes had grown extra wide hearing the words that came out of the doctor's mouth. ‚ÄúMaybe we should do it again. What if you got the wrong results? There‚Äôs always a chance for slip-ups, right?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou look surprised,‚Äù the doctor said, her mouth pulled in a polite smile. Something No√©mie found comforting and critical at the same time. ‚ÄúDo you not want one?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like that,‚Äù No√©mie muttered, releasing a sigh, biting on her lower lip and rubbing her arms. Not because the air-conditioning in the room had got chillier, but because she didn‚Äôt know what else to do to keep her hands busy.   
  
Besides, it was also calming in a way. Something she realized she desperately needed right now. Seeing how her heart was causing havoc inside. A huge part of her was offensively terrified.  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù   
  
Now, how was she supposed to explain that?  
  
Two months ago, after she woke up in her boss‚Äôs bed, she had done everything in her strength to run away from him. She changed the country, the job, the contact details, the friends (well, maybe not all of them), and whatever was possible there to change. She did all that to escape the humiliation. So she wouldn‚Äôt have to face that man ever again. She did not even wait for him to apologize for his not-so-sophisticated actions.  
  
In hindsight, it was kind of a rash decision, yet not the one she regretted.  
  
She was so livid with him that day. How could he do this to her?  
  
For three years, she worked for him with all the devotion and sincerity in the world. He was not the easiest person to work for, tossing orders around like a freaking royalty.   
  
But at least he wasn‚Äôt a playboy like his younger brother, either. He didn‚Äôt flirt with every single thing that moved and breathed and had a pair of perky boobs. Unlike his coquettish brother, Ajax Halest was well-mannered, cultured, and no-nonsense. Something she had admired about him since day one. He always looked so tough and focused. No√©mie rarely saw him without his signature grimace. The one that never left him. Not even when he slept.  
  
She struggled to imagine if a man of his stature could ever apologize. He was so arrogant, often, she should know. She alone dealt with his mysterious mood swings all the time.   
  
Until that fateful night when he destroyed the image she had of him when he fell from her eyes so low, she wasn‚Äôt certain if there was anything he could do to reverse that.  
  
Burying her face into her hands, she strained her face hard. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm ready for it.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nervous,‚Äù the doctor said, the pleasant smile continuing to dance across her lips. Her eyes shone with an understanding No√©mie hoped to see in her family‚Äôs eyes, too. Would they be angry at her? They would probably want to know who the man was. How would she answer the millions of questions they would barrage her with? ‚ÄúWhich is absolutely normal.‚Äù  
  
No√©mie drew in a deep breath and lifted her head. ‚ÄúAre you really sure?‚Äù she asked, hoping the answer would be different this time. Although she should have known better than to doubt the capability of her own ears.  
  
‚ÄúIf you want, I can run another test,‚Äù the kind doctor suggested, patience reflected through her every word. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm positive the result would remain the same. You‚Äôre two months pregnant, Ms Rochester. Congratulations.‚Äù  
  
Deep down, No√©mie could feel a hurl of emotions. There was so much going on inside her.   
  
That morning, when she woke up, only to throw her guts out, she stupidly thought she might have gotten a stomach bug after one of her colleague‚Äôs birthday bash the previous night. She had had no drinks, but there was definitely something fishy about those Manchurian balls. They tasted‚Ä¶different.  
  
Not that it mattered now.  
  
Sighing to herself, No√©mie thanked the doctor and collected her reports and prescription before heading out of the hospital.   
  
On her way to the parking lot, though, she was so lost in her thoughts that she failed to notice the man who walked right into her.  
  
All the papers in his and her hands dropped and flew everywhere.  
  
‚ÄúDammit!‚Äù the man cursed out loud, dropping on his haunches and furiously collecting all the papers. The man seemed to be in so much rush that he growled when he couldn‚Äôt distinguish which belonged to who. ‚ÄúThey all look exactly the same!‚Äù  
  
They didn‚Äôt. But he was panicking. But surprisingly, No√©mie thought she could see right through him.  
  
Putting aside the pit of her unease, she sank to her knees on the ground and helped him sort everything out. She gathered the papers and read them briefly before stacking them separately.  
  
‚ÄúHere.‚Äù Once done, she pushed all the papers in the file she thought belonged to him and handed them over. ‚ÄúDone!‚Äù  
  
The man took the file and stood up, letting his shoulders drop with relief washing over him. ‚ÄúThank you so much. Although I should probably apologize for running into you first.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright,‚Äù No√©mie was quick to dismiss his apology. She had noticed how tense and restless he was a moment ago. It was obvious why he wasn‚Äôt paying attention to where he was going. Hospitals weren‚Äôt the most delightful places in the world. Who knew what distress he was going through? She felt sorry for him. ‚ÄúThere is nothing to be apologetic for. Take care of yourself.‚Äù  
  
With that, she gave him a nod and turned towards the spot where she had parked her car. It wasn‚Äôt far from where she had bumped into that poor man.  
  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
  
Little did she know that the accident wasn‚Äôt actually an accident.   
  
The man who bumped into her did that on purpose, to serve an even greater purpose.  
  
As he watched No√©mie getting into the car and driving away, he took the phone out of his pocket and dialed a number.   
  
After three rings, someone finally picked up and answered.  
  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in Bordeaux,‚Äù he furnished confidently.  
  
‚ÄúAre you sure it‚Äôs her?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúAbsolutely positive.‚Äù  
  
The man on the other end of the phone hummed thoughtfully. ‚ÄúAnything else?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúShe visited the hospital today.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure,‚Äù he rubbed his temples, turning around to protect his eyes from the blunt rays of the sun. ‚ÄúBut she looked anxious and lost while leaving.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúGet in and find out whatever she was there for. You have an hour.‚Äù  
  
The man nodded firmly. ‚ÄúOn it.‚Äù  
  


# Chapter 2

Later that day, when No√©mie reached her apartment, she had barely unlocked the door when she heard the loud sound of another door slamming shut across the hallway.  
  
‚ÄúRochester,‚Äù a male voice called out from behind her, surprising her. ‚ÄúFunny seeing you here. Your boss suddenly tripped over the concept of a day off, eh?‚Äù  
  
No√©mie struggled to fight a smile as she turned on her heels and came face to face with Ga√´l Marchant‚Äîa handsome pilot who lived on the same floor as her and owned the most beautiful car in the entire building.  
  
He was pretty cocky about it, and even though he could afford a much better, more luxurious place than this building offered, he seemed perfectly content with his stay. No√©mie had tried to understand his reasons at first, but with so much on her plate, she eventually gave up.  
  
‚ÄúIf I say yes, will that make you feel better?‚Äù she asked with a smile, flipping her dark hair off her shoulder as she moved her arms behind her back, not wanting him to see the file she was carrying.  
  
For some reason, she thought he would judge her if he found out about her current predicament. And despite them being nothing more than good neighbors, she didn‚Äôt like the idea of tarnishing her reputation in his eyes. Perhaps a bit cocky, but he was one of the good guys, and, sadly, his company meant a lot to her in this far-off city.  
  
He hummed. ‚ÄúDepends‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOn what?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHow long your boss can keep up the righteous act and continue to have some mercy on your poor, overworked soul?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm overworked?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHave you seen yourself in the mirror?‚Äù  
  
No√©mie pursed her lips, unsure if he was serious or just fooling around.  
  
But then he broke into laughter, and she breathed a sigh of relief.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an i\*\*\*t!‚Äù she pouted, shaking her head as she turned to unlock her apartment door.  
  
Ga√´l laughed, leaning his shoulder against the wall as he watched her struggle with the key. ‚ÄúHere, let me help,‚Äù he offered, raising his arm to reach for the key.  
  
No√©mie hadn‚Äôt expected the offer. While she continued to fumble with the lock, his warm hand clamped over hers, and she stiffened.  
  
Their eyes met briefly before he gently nudged her aside and took her place instead.  
  
Now standing off to the side, No√©mie watched, wrapping her arms around herself, as he smoothly pushed the key in and, with some magical technique she failed to notice‚Äîthanks to his large hands‚Äîunlocked the door with a satisfying click.  
  
The grin on his face was cockier than ever as he stepped back and gave the door a gentle push. ‚ÄúHere you go, Your Highness,‚Äù he teased, dropping the key back into her hand before thrusting his hands into his jeans pockets.  
  
‚ÄúThanks for the help, Ga√´l,‚Äù No√©mie muttered, feeling a slight heat rush up her neck. She had no idea why she was suddenly so flustered. She‚Äôd always been good at handling his weirdness. Perhaps the news of her pregnancy had turned her into a sensitive mess. She could only hope to sort herself out before things got out of hand.  
  
Ga√´l only nodded before taking another step back. ‚ÄúSo, are you coming to the rooftop party tonight? It‚Äôs Steven‚Äôs ninth birthday. Maybe Mrs. Colbert will finally open the bar this time.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo. But keep dreaming,‚Äù she chuckled, finally stepping inside her apartment and turning to face him. ‚ÄúMrs. Colbert‚Äôs ex-husband died of an alcohol overdose. She wouldn‚Äôt want to expose her dear son to something like that.‚Äù  
  
Mrs. Colbert was the landlord who owned the entire building and lived on the ground floor. She was kind and thoughtful but strict‚Äîand a little intimidating when it came to rent and her son.  
  
‚ÄúReally?‚Äù He sounded surprised. ‚ÄúI thought those were just rumors,‚Äù he said, scratching the back of his head.  
  
‚ÄúOh, they are so not. Take my advice and stop spoiling her son. Because once she figures out all the ridiculous tips you‚Äôve been giving him to impress girls, she‚Äôll throw you out so fast you won‚Äôt know what hit you,‚Äù she teased, though there wasn‚Äôt a single lie in her words.  
  
Ga√´l narrowed his eyes, rubbing his neck briefly. ‚ÄúOh well, why didn‚Äôt you warn me earlier?‚Äù he said, making a face like someone had just saved him from running a red light. ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll have to cancel our top-secret meeting for today then,‚Äù he added with all the seriousness in the world before a slight grin once again claimed his handsome face.  
  
He leaned closer to her doorway. ‚ÄúSince my schedule just cleared up for the next hour or so, how about I take you out for coffee? You just saved me from losing my place, after all. Let me treat you to a pleasant drink and some almond croissants. What do you say?‚Äù he winked.  
  
No√©mie chuckled at his sudden shift in demeanor. But she knew he was only messing with her, just like he did with every single woman in the building. That being said, he almost sounded genuine in his offer.  
  
‚ÄúUnfortunately, I‚Äôll have to say no. Sorry. I‚Äôm not feeling too well. I should probably get some rest.‚Äù  
  
When Ga√´l opened his mouth, No√©mie thought he was about to say something. But instead, he covered his mouth with his hand and brushed his lower lip.  
  
‚ÄúWell then, you better take care of yourself, Rochester. Call me if you need anything.‚Äù  
  
And with that, he turned on his heels and was gone.  
  
No√©mie stood there for a while, her door half-open, wondering if his offer had been sincere. It couldn‚Äôt be, right? He was probably just pulling her leg, seeing as there was a distinct lack of men in her life. He liked to do that a lot.  
  
Sighing to herself, she stepped back inside and closed the door.  
  
That evening, Mrs. Colbert showed up, inviting her to the birthday party. But No√©mie had to politely refuse‚Äîshe wasn‚Äôt feeling particularly festive, and the idea of faking a good time was too exhausting for her already worn-out mind.  
  
Thankfully, Mrs. Colbert didn‚Äôt seem to mind. In fact, she told her not to hesitate if she needed anything. At that moment, the back of No√©mie‚Äôs eyes prickled with hot tears. She suddenly felt so emotional, her face growing red as she struggled to hold them back.  
  
Mrs. Colbert must have noticed something because, after leaving to attend the party, she returned later with a slice of cake just for No√©mie. The gesture was so sweet, it touched her deeply.  
  
That entire night, No√©mie couldn‚Äôt sleep. She kept scrolling up and down her phone, unsure whether to call her sister or not. Claudia was the only person she could trust right now. Besides, she desperately needed someone to vent to‚Äîsomeone to listen to her frustrations and anxieties.  
  
There was so much she wanted to say.  
  
To scream.  
  
To yell.  
  
But living alone in this godforsaken city meant she had no one to confide in.  
  
And it sucked. So much.  
  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
  
No√©mie wasn‚Äôt sure what time it was when the doorbell rang‚Äîtwice.  
  
With a weary frown, she rolled out of bed and switched on the lights.  
  
First, she checked the time.  
  
The wall clock displayed 4:18 AM.  
  
That was weird.  
  
Who could possibly be outside her door at this hour? Was there some kind of emergency? The last time someone bothered her in the middle of the night was during a false fire alarm. She really hoped this wasn‚Äôt another one of those. She was too exhausted to leave her bed so early.  
  
The doorbell rang again.  
  
Rubbing her eyes, she tightened the knot of her robe and dragged herself toward the door.  
  
Whoever was outside was growing impatient. Instead of concern, annoyance scratched at No√©mie‚Äôs face.  
  
Ready to give the person a piece of her mind, she unlatched the door and swung it open.  
  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äî‚Äù  
  
But the words barely left her lips before her eyes landed on the man standing across from her.  
  
The color drained from her face.  
  
A jolt of shock shot down her spine as a lump formed in her throat.  
  
What was he doing here?  
  
Standing before her, dressed in a crisp Armani suit, was the brother of the man who had ruined her life.  
  
The man responsible for the pain she still carried.  
  
Vincent Halest smiled, his sharp gray eyes glinting.

Payton  
  
A RED AND GOLD LEAF FLOATS ACROSS THE ROOM, SEEMINGLY WEIGHTLESS, BEFORE SETTLING ONTO the carpet between my spot on the couch and the TV.  
  
I glance at my open patio door where another gust of wind brings the scent of promised rain, but instead of getting up, I tuck my legs underneath me and pull my fleece blanket up to my chin, careful not to tip the bowl of popcorn resting on the cushion next to me.  
  
A storm is coming.  
  
You spoiled brat, I‚Äôm gonna teach you‚Ä¶  
  
I snuggle further into the corner of my couch. That was so long ago, I remind myself, inhaling deeply through my nose, willing new memories to replace the old.  
  
This is my home.  
  
I‚Äôm safe here.  
  
The low rumble of distant thunder calms me further.  
  
No matter how much they tried to beat it out of me, I never lost my love of violent weather.  
  
I never understood why I was supposed to be scared of storms. Didn‚Äôt understand why it made me different, or wrong, or stupid‚Äì‚Äìlike they claimed.  
  
It wasn‚Äôt the violence I craved, it was the change. The washing away. The cleansing. That smallest sliver of hope that a wave might crash through, dragging away the old, leaving something new.  
  
And maybe that‚Äôs why I still like them. There‚Äôs still that spot in my chest, deep inside of me, that wants to be sucked up into the sky, whisked away from it all, and dropped into Oz.  
  
As if summoned by the wind, the woman on screen opens her front door and the world around her morphs from black and white to color, and I let the familiar sense of nostalgia wash over me.  
  
The sounds of the nearing storm keep filtering in and out of my awareness, even as I sway my head to the familiar songs.  
  
My hand is halfway to my mouth, popcorn between my fingers, when the dull noise of groaning metal drags my gaze to the patio, the sliding glass door open wide.  
  
The gauzy curtains I installed last year are flowing eerily with the breeze, but the streetlamp outside is burnt out, so I can‚Äôt see beyond my tiny balcony.  
  
I‚Äôve never really trusted that balcony, it‚Äôs as shabby as the rest of this building. But I figured it‚Äôd take more than a little inclement weather to knock it down.  
  
I give myself a mental gold star for never bothering with furniture out there as I lick the salt off my fingers.  
  
Another roll of thunder, closer this time, draws my attention back to the balcony.  
  
And the man standing in my open door.  
  
CHAPTER 2  
  
Payton  
  
A SCREAM CATCHES IN MY THROAT, TOO STRANGLED TO BE HEARD. I‚Äôm dreaming.  
  
My eyes squeeze shut, and I force myself to breathe.  
  
I must be dreaming.  
  
But when I open them again, the man is still there. And coming closer.  
  
The man crosses half of my apartment in two long strides, putting him only feet away.  
  
Adrenaline courses through my body, yet I don‚Äôt move.  
  
To my own humiliation, I don‚Äôt do anything.  
  
There‚Äôs a man in my home.  
  
Aside from the television, the lamp in the corner is the only light on. And it does little to illuminate the man in front of me.  
  
He‚Äôs tall. I‚Äôm sitting but I can tell he‚Äôs tall. And‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs wearing a suit.  
  
Why is he wearing a suit?  
  
Does that make this worse?  
  
‚ÄúEvening.‚Äù His voice is deep. But gentle. Soft even. And my brain doesn‚Äôt know how to react. My heart is racing.  
  
My hands are shaking.  
  
But the rest of me doesn‚Äôt move.  
  
‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he says, as he takes a few slow steps, crossing in front of the TV. ‚ÄúYou really shouldn‚Äôt leave your door open like that.‚Äù  
  
My lips part, but my words get jumbled on my tongue and I have to swallow before trying again.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the second floor,‚Äù I whisper, still trying to understand what‚Äôs happening.  
  
He tilts his head, and it feels like he‚Äôs humoring my response, but I can‚Äôt focus on that. Because the angle allows the light to fall across his features. And‚Ä¶  
  
Dark eyes. Dark brows. Nearly black hair tousled yet styled back, and sharp cheekbones outlined with a trimmed beard in the same shade.  
  
I swallow again.  
  
He looks like he came from a photoshoot. Or a boardroom. Or a photoshoot of a boardroom. And an inner voice is shouting at me that that should make this even scarier.  
  
Should.  
  
I also notice that his clothes aren‚Äôt wet, which means the rain hasn‚Äôt started. And for some reason, that saddens me. Like that detail alone seals my ruin.  
  
This is why I‚Äôve always been such a victim.  
  
My instincts are broken. My mind always steers away from the important parts. Zeroing in on ridiculous details, and not on a game plan.  
  
Keeping his body facing me, the man glances around my apartment.  
  
I don‚Äôt know a lot about men‚Äôs suits, but I‚Äôm guessing his clothes cost more than all my belongings put together.  
  
My stuff isn‚Äôt fancy, and it looks just as cheap as it is. A second hand couch and scuffed coffee table. The small TV on a cheap stand I had to assemble myself with an Allen wrench. My round table with one chair, tucked in the corner. And a thin stretch of island designating the divide between the living room and kitchen. A kitchen that‚Äôs more of a kitchenette, complete with laminate counters that are peeling at the edges.  
  
I resist the urge to sigh at the sight of my phone sitting on said kitchen counter. Mocking me with the idea of calling the police, knowing I‚Äôll never get the chance.  
  
Not that they‚Äôve ever helped me in the past.  
  
My single bedroom and bathroom are on the other side of the kitchen, but darkness swallows them.  
  
The man makes a noise in the back of his throat as he takes it all in. I have no idea what he‚Äôs thinking. Or why I should be so anxious for his approval. Like there‚Äôs anything in this sad setting to approve of. Or any benefit if one‚Äôs murderer likes their apartment.  
  
A police siren wails outside.  
  
Then another.  
  
And a moment later, I watch the flash of red and blue lights bounce down through the night as cop cars speed past my building.  
  
Slowly, I turn my gaze back to the man facing me.  
  
He lifts a shoulder, and the edge of his mouth pulls up into a smirk.  
  
This man is running from the cops.  
  
He‚Äôs running from the cops and he‚Äôs standing in my living room. Like nothing is amiss. Like he just decided to take a different route home.  
  
His body shifts and I think that maybe that‚Äôs all this will be. The police have passed by, now he can leave.  
  
But he lifts a foot and steps closer.  
  
Panic starts to flare brighter inside me, hitting its flash point, when another gust of wind lifts the edge of his suit jacket.  
  
Oh god, he has a gun.  
  
He doesn‚Äôt reach for it though. He just‚Ä¶ lowers himself onto the couch. My couch.  
  
Beside me.  
  
Once again, my mouth opens with nothing coming out.  
  
What is he doing?  
  
What is happening?  
  
‚ÄúI love this movie,‚Äù he says, almost to himself.  
  
What. In. The. Hell. Is happening?  
  
His large body fills up too much space on the couch. All my furniture is small. Small because my apartment is small. Small because it‚Äôs only ever me here.  
  
I sit frozen, wondering if I should say something, but he keeps his focus on the tv.  
  
Is he‚Ä¶ is he just gonna stay here?  
  
I start to shift, wondering if I can just get up and slip away.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather you didn‚Äôt get up.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt turn his head when he says it, his tone casual. But there‚Äôs no hiding the fact that it‚Äôs not a request.  
  
My breathing picks up, as I remain facing forward. Prickles running up and down my arms.  
  
Great, now my animal reaction decides to catch up to the situation. There‚Äôs no question that this man is dangerous.  
  
And he‚Äôs too close.  
  


# 2

I never let men get this close.  
  
My entire body starts to tremble. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù I cut off my plea, not wanting to put my specific fears into words.  
  
I can hear the rustle of fabric as he starts to turn toward me, and I squeeze my eyes shut.  
  
This can‚Äôt be happening.  
  
This can‚Äôt be real.  
  
‚ÄúRelax.‚Äù  
  
A large hand settles on my thigh, and I stiffen even more.  
  
The weight of his palm is alarming, the heat of his touch searing me through the blanket.  
  
His hand presses down with a little more force. ‚ÄúRelax.‚Äù  
  
His tone is even gentler this time, and I try to take a steady breath. A dark scent fills my nostrils. It‚Äôs leather and fire and cologne.  
  
Jesus, is that him?  
  
My eyes slip open.  
  
He‚Äôs leaning toward me, invading my space further, and the stance should feel dominating. But there‚Äôs something in his body language, or maybe it‚Äôs something in his eyes, that makes my body obey. Makes me relax, just a little.  
  
His gaze travels over my face, and this close, I can see a tinge of green in his eyes. They‚Äôre stunning.  
  
His eyes move back to mine. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to hurt you.‚Äù  
  
When I don‚Äôt reply, he tips his head down, a command implied with the movement.  
  
‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I mostly mouth the word, my voice too quiet to hear, but he nods anyway, a pleased look crossing his features.  
  
Pleased that I believe him?  
  
Do I believe him?  
  
His hand slides off my thigh, taking the heat with him. ‚ÄúMay I?‚Äù May you what?!  
  
Before I have time to start spiraling, he lifts the bowl of popcorn from the spot between us.  
  
Oh.  
  
Without waiting for an answer, he settles back, props his feet up on the coffee table and sets the bowl on his lap. Then, casual as ever, he drapes one arm across the back of the couch, fingers nearly touching my shoulder, like he‚Äôs here for a date and not a home invasion.  
  
I watch as he starts to eat the popcorn, whole handfuls at a time, never dropping a single piece on himself.  
  
I should do something.  
  
There must be something I should do.  
  
His jaw works as he chews, the muscles in the side of his neck flexing.  
  
I mean I know I should leave. Or make him leave. But how?  
  
With my eyes still on his profile, waiting for whatever‚Äôs going to happen next, I hear the character on the screen talk about courage. And I wish more than anything I had some.  
  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù  
  
I jump when he speaks, then bite my lip. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I should tell you that.‚Äù I see his eyes flick over in my direction. ‚ÄúClever girl.‚Äù Those two syllables bounce across my skin.  
  
My fingers tighten around the blanket, pulling it even higher. I can‚Äôt find this man attractive.  
  
I really can not.  
  
My stomach clenches and my stupid brain takes this moment to remind me that I probably look like a disheveled mess.  
  
Not that it matters. I don‚Äôt need this intruder to think I‚Äôm sexy. In fact it‚Äôs probably better that he doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs probably better that I have popcorn breath and a ponytail that needs adjusting. And bangs that are going every which way since they got damp when I washed the makeup off my face before sitting down to watch my favorite movie for the four-hundredth time.  
  
The fingers near my shoulder tap against the backrest, keeping in time with the characters on TV as they skip down the road.  
  
This has got to be the weirdest thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me.  
  
A hot as hell man walks in through my second story balcony. Strolls through my apartment with a confidence I can only dream of having. Flashes me a glimpse of his gun. Then settles in to eat my popcorn.  
  
And‚Ä¶ is he humming?  
  
Sweet Mother Mary, he‚Äôs humming.  
  
With careful, small movements, I push myself further into the corner. Trying to add any amount of distance I can between us.  
  
I want to ask his name. Ask him what he‚Äôs running from. But I feel like the less knowledge I have, the better.  
  
Except you‚Äôve seen his face, my inner voice unhelpfully reminds me.  
  
Not knowing what else to do, I stare at his profile. Watching the way the light dances off his eyes. The way his mouth opens and closes around handfuls of popcorn. The way his shoulders seem relaxed.  
  
He seems so at ease. So‚Ä¶ comfortable.  
  
My lids lower in a slow blink and I force them wide.  
  
I can‚Äôt make out the clock on the microwave from here, but I know it‚Äôs past my bedtime. I didn‚Äôt intend on staying up for the entire film because waking up at five a.m. every weekday means I go to bed early. And I haven‚Äôt been sleeping well this week. Hell, I haven‚Äôt been sleeping well the past twenty-seven years.  
  
He chews another mouthful, and I watch the movement of his Adam‚Äôs apple as he swallows. Maybe this really is all a dream.  
  
Maybe I‚Äôm already in bed, sound asleep",1,1746854224.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1kj2np6,https://www.reddit.com/r/University/comments/1kj2np6/no_ivy_no_problem_the_top_global_universities_of/,No Ivy? No Problem! The Top Global Universities of 2025 (That Aren‚Äôt in the U.S.),"So, Times Higher Ed just dropped their 2025 rankings of the best universities outside the U.S., and I gotta say ‚Äî it‚Äôs basically the Champions League of education. And spoiler alert: the UK and Asia are out here playing academic chess while the rest are still figuring out the rules of checkers.

Oxford takes the crown again, because of course it does. Somewhere, a guy in tweed just lit a celebratory pipe. Right behind are Cambridge and Imperial College London, who‚Äôve clearly decided Britain will stay relevant academically, even if geopolitics has gone full Brexit.

Now here‚Äôs where it gets spicy. ETH Z√ºrich (a.k.a. Einstein‚Äôs alma mater) is holding it down for Switzerland ‚Äî proving they don‚Äôt just do chocolate and banking, they also breed geniuses. Asia is absolutely crushing it too: Tsinghua, Peking, NUS, UTokyo, and NTU are rising so fast you‚Äôd think they‚Äôve figured out how to 10x research with AI and boba tea.

Canada enters the chat with University of Toronto and McGill, and honestly? If you‚Äôre looking for a world-class education with universal healthcare and Tim Hortons, that‚Äôs your sign.

Germany, as usual, shows up with its efficient, well-oiled academic machine: LMU Munich, TU Munich, and Heidelberg are making sure beer and brains are not mutually exclusive.

And let‚Äôs not sleep on France, Australia, Sweden, and South Korea ‚Äî all placing serious contenders. Meanwhile, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Netherlands are quietly building academic empires while everyone‚Äôs distracted by ChatGPT hallucinations.

Couple of wild academic facts that blew my mind:
	‚Ä¢ETH Z√ºrich gave the world Einstein, so basically if your thesis isn‚Äôt bending space-time, don‚Äôt even try.
	‚Ä¢Oxford has more Nobel Prize winners than the GDP of some small nations.
	‚Ä¢McGill alumni include astronauts and William Shatner ‚Äî yes, Captain Kirk went there.

The real takeaway?
You don‚Äôt need to bleed Ivy green to win in life. The global university scene is more lit than ever. Whether you‚Äôre gunning for a postgrad, scouting for your next genius co-founder, or just ranking places based on proximity to good coffee ‚Äî these schools are worth watching.

It‚Äôs no longer about where you study, it‚Äôs about how globally connected your uni is. And some of these schools are running rings around the traditional U.S. heavyweights.

So if you‚Äôre still thinking MIT or bust‚Ä¶ think again.

Would love to hear where y‚Äôall are applying or dreaming to go. Anyone here studying at one of these? What‚Äôs it really like?",0,1746854105.0,University,0,0.5,False

My workplace, in North Carolina, is beyond toxic and I‚Äôve stayed because of the money. I work in a ‚Äúfancy‚Äù steakhouse and the money is better here than the other options available to me currently. I love my coworkers. We go out after work regularly, celebrate each other‚Äôs birthdays and go out to lunches together on our days off. It‚Äôs difficult to leave this type of camaraderie.

The problem is the owner. He creates an environment where we‚Äôre constantly in the wrong, our efforts are never enough and believes everyone one of his staff is stealing from him. Every single day one of us or a few of us are targeted by him and creates problems that only lead to confusion and stress.

I had to get between him and a new server the other night because he had been tormenting her all day and she‚Äôd made a few mistakes because of the heightened anxiety he causing her. End of the night he followed her to the dish pit and was chewing her out to the point that she was shaking uncontrollably. I stepped between the two of them and told him stop. If I hadn‚Äôt been there he would have continued harassing her.

Lately he‚Äôs decided that charging servers for mistakes is acceptable. One server forgot ring in a coffee. Coffee that was about to poured out because it was closing time. He still charged her. The other night, two servers were on a party table of 20 guests. The host made up the ticket for them to give to the guest who made the reservation. The appetizer platters weren‚Äôt added to the ticket. Now the owner is telling them that he‚Äôs going to take that money out of those servers paychecks. I know that charging severs for mistakes is illegal and I‚Äôm going to push for proper remedy before taking further action.

The busers are tipped out based on how many guests we have. They get 60 cents per guest. Their hourly is $2.13. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs legal or not because they have no control over their tipping situation the way servers do.

What I‚Äôm posting here for is advice on what information I need to collect before taking further action? If going to The Department of Labor or getting an attorney is the better approach?

Happy to answer any questions as long as they don‚Äôt lead to doxing myself or the restaurant.

I do have a Zerno z1 in the wait so grinder isn‚Äôt an issue. I‚Äôm mostly on very light to medium light beans(SEY, Devoci√≥n, coffee collective‚Ä¶), drinking both pour over and espresso and milk drinks, depends on the mood of the day.I'm now torn between Micra, De1Pro and Argos. I chose these mostly bc of the size as my space is tiny and the table depth is very limiting. I also want something robust and heat up quick, but compact.

Micra bc I always wanted a LM and it's the smallest and ""cheapest"", but it's just a flat profile machine and lacking many features, and the so called pre-brew function is meh. Yes slayer mod is possible but that means another 700 euros+tariffs(thank you trump). That makes the final machine come to 5k+USD range, seems very unreasonable.

De1pro seems more fun with all the digital stuff and technically can produce the best results, but the pump noise just sounds so eh, unpleasant. And no white option(XL doesn't quite fit my space) is a down side as look is important at this price range, I still want it to fit my kitchen. Another thing is I‚Äôm not sure the ‚Äúbuild quality‚Äù and have also heard of buggy software.

Argos seems like a legit choice for a fun spring lever machine and is the cheapest among the three. I put it in because it‚Äôs such a unique level machine, I like the air bleed valve, have great temp control, and it uses 58mm portafilter, and a very very small footprint. but somehow my heart still itches to own a dual boiler machine if it's going to be a boiler type machine. Plus it seems like it would be an overlap with my current F58.

She was my first serious girlfriend and I love her more than anything I had ever thought possible. My childhood wasn‚Äôt great I only met my biological father once (in court) and was open about the fact he wanted nothing to do with me, my mom died when I was 14 of a heroin overdose in a rite aid bathroom, and the man I called dad while I know he ment good, had anger issues and was verbally abusive telling me things such as that I‚Äôm worthless and waste of sperm and pretty much anything you could think of If he was pissed enough. I was overweight and bullied in school and I struggled to make friends long story short I lived a lot of my childhood and all of my teens depressed. Im no movie star and have always struggled to talk to girls but as I got more into my late teens and early 20‚Äôs I tried and tried to get a girl to be interested in me, though every dating app known to man I tried asking out a girl I worked with tried being nice to strangers but nothing worked I was just slumping into a deeper and deeper depression until somehow I managed to meet the absolutely most cutest, shyest girl ever and on my birthday of all days I felt like I hit the lottery jackpot I was so happy I felt happiness and feelings I had never felt in my life it was the best birthday present I could have ever asked for. A month later we start dating officially and were together happily for about 2 years never having an argument always just happy to be in each others company and be together doing things she understood me and I felt like I could be myself around her instead of hiding myself like usual and it was the first and only time in my life I actually felt happy, I didn‚Äôt feel self conscious, and I had some confidence in myself. One week she was supposed to come over on a Friday, but she said her mom traded shifts with someone at work so instead of Friday she was going to come over on Thursday instead so she could be home to let her dogs out NBD. She comes over Thursday and spends the night like usual. But when we wake up in the morning she tells me she had this very weird nightmare of some weird guy /shadowy figure that was following her around I didn‚Äôt really think much of it but had her assure me that she was alright and then I had to head off to work unfortunately. She slept in a little longer but woke up like 2 hours later and texted me that she was going to drop me off a coffee at work on her way to her home.

Finished my work day and went home we called and talked on my way home from work around 4, texted afterwards but then at 7pm she stops responding to everything I don‚Äôt find it to be that weird at first because I‚Äôm not the type to demand she be texting me 24/7 but by 10:30/11 as im starting to get ready for bed and she‚Äôs still not responding I‚Äôm getting kinda worried but not blowing her phone up. I lay down anyway and am woken up to a call around 3am from her mother saying she came home and found her lying on the bathroom floor. 3 dreadful months of not knowing what happened we finally get word that she had a undiagnosed heart defect from birth and she just dropped dead instantly from a heart attack. After it happened I called my entire immediate family, ( I have many siblings some half some not technically blood, 2 of them being from my before mentioned biological father that I didn‚Äôt even know existed until I was 18 and they sought me out and found me) and everyone on the surface was supportive and telling me they‚Äôre here for me and all of that. But in practice not a single one of them besides one of my brothers can even have the time to wish me a happy birthday or merry Christmas let alone legitimately check in on me.

1kj2eca,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kj2eca/aitah_for_negotiating_cash_for_keys_with_a_family/,AITAH for negotiating cash for keys with a family member/landlord,"I was living at a family members rental property. The property was unfinished (abandoned remodel), had been sitting empty for three years, and had disgusting carpet but a view that people would kill for. 

I was paying below market rate rent. If they had listed it on the open market, due to the condition it was in, I'm not sure if they could have rented it out for much more. 

They refused to give me a lease, preferred to keep it simple and go month to month. I lived there for about a year and a half and enjoyed it very much. It was more space than I could otherwise afford and I loved drinking coffee in the morning while looking over the city and the mountains from the window. 

They jerked me around a bit. Telling me they needed me to move out and then going back on it multiple times, raising and lowering rent arbitrarily, and finally they doubled my rent and told me to get a roommate in exchange for a 1 year lease. 

I agreed and found a roommate. Took about 30 hours worth of effort in total to get to that point. 

Once I found a roommate however, they decided they didn't want to do that and decided they were going to sell the place. Well they had to sell the place, they bought a new place and were doing some tax thing to swap the properties and forgo capital gains tax. Something they would not have been able to do without establishing rental income from me. 

They told me I had a little under two months to move out (I was entitled to 60 days written notice by law but they were family and it was close enough). I acted accordingly. After 3 weeks, they showed up with a realtor unannounced and promptly told me I had to be out in a week. 

I was furious. I had had a place lined up for the 1st of the next month as was the original plan. But had nowhere to go for the 3 weeks in between. I told them that. 

They said first, to get a hotel. I told them I can't afford a 3 week hotel stay. They told to me to ask my parents for money. I said no. 

Then they said they found an Airbnb I could stay at for that time that was cheaper than my rent and they would pay 1/3 of the cost but I had to get rid of my cat because the Airbnb didn't allow cats. I was furious. 

I value my cat above anyone else. I've had him since I was a teenager and all through college and he moved out to California with me. 

I told them I would be enforcing my full rights as a tenant. And staying until the end of a 60 days written notice period. Refusing unsupervised access for contractors for the remodel, enforcing habitability standards, and demanding repairs be made to things that were not in working order.

They lost their shit. Gave me a sob story about how they have to sell it because they already bought the other place. They did me a favor by renting me an unfinished, kinda gross condo at a cheap price and that all they are asking for is a favor in return. I said that favor would be making me and my cat homeless for 3 weeks and spending more than I could afford to with a new security deposit on the horizon. 

They said well what can we do to get you out. I demanded cash for keys. I laid out what a suitable Airbnb would cost for 3 weeks, moving expenses x2, and compensation for my time and energy at my hourly rate for my current job. Plus a hardship fee of $500. I said I am not negotiating at this point. If you say no, I will enforce my full rights. 

They reluctantly agreed. And are now pissed and seem to think I extorted them.

My workplace, in North Carolina, is beyond toxic and I‚Äôve stayed because of the money. I work in a ‚Äúfancy‚Äù steakhouse and the money is better here than the other options available to me currently. I love my coworkers. We go out after work regularly, celebrate each other‚Äôs birthdays and go out to lunches together on our days off. It‚Äôs difficult to leave this type of camaraderie. 

The problem is the owner. He creates an environment where we‚Äôre constantly in the wrong, our efforts are never enough and believes everyone one of his staff is stealing from him. Every single day one of us or a few of us are targeted by him and creates problems that only lead to confusion and stress. 

I had to get between him and a new server the other night because he had been tormenting her all day and she‚Äôd made a few mistakes because of the heightened anxiety he causing her. End of the night he followed her to the dish pit and was chewing her out to the point that she was shaking uncontrollably. I stepped between the two of them and told him stop. If I hadn‚Äôt been there he would have continued harassing her. 

Lately he‚Äôs decided that charging servers for mistakes is acceptable. One server forgot ring in a coffee. Coffee that was about to poured out because it was closing time. He still charged her. The other night, two servers were on a party table of 20 guests. The host made up the ticket for them to give to the guest who made the reservation. The appetizer platters weren‚Äôt added to the ticket. Now the owner is telling them that he‚Äôs going to take that money out of those servers paychecks. I know that charging severs for mistakes is illegal and I‚Äôm going to push for proper remedy before taking further action. 

The busers are tipped out based on how many guests we have. They get 60 cents per guest. Their hourly is $2.13. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs legal or not because they have no control over their tipping situation the way servers do. 

What I‚Äôm posting here for is advice on what information I need to collect before taking further action? If going to The Department of Labor or getting an attorney is the better approach?

I didn‚Äôt mention it to my boyfriend because he is confrontational and I didn‚Äôt want him to blow things out of proportion or be upset.

after that night I tried to keep showing up to work like normal but then M and T started doing things like T bringing me coffee, M playing with my hair when she came over to my desk to talk to me, T insisting to walk my bags to my car, etc. 

Earlier everything built up and when I went to see my boyfriend after work i just started venting to him. He was mad that I didn‚Äôt say anything sooner to him or that I didn‚Äôt tell my boss and asked if I liked the guy (I absolutely do not but I don‚Äôt think he believes me) I told him that this is my first ‚Äúgood‚Äù job after graduating college last year and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin it by burning any bridges and didn‚Äôt wanna mess with anyone‚Äôs job.

My dad passed very suddenly from cardiac arrest four months ago. He was here one minute, and gone the next. I am 32 years old and somehow still depended on my dad for so much. He was truly one of my best friends. He was a part of every piece of my life. I managed the coffee shop that he owned so we worked very closely together as well. He was the best person, everyone who knew him loved him. Even after four months the shock still hasn‚Äôt worn off. I just can‚Äôt believe that he‚Äôs gone. I feel like I‚Äôve already reached the stage where people look at me and can‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm still so sad. But I just truly don‚Äôt know how to live this life without him. It feels like every good thing has been ripped from the world. 

I also recently got married. My fianc√© and I went through a long immigration process and he had finally just arrived and we were so excited to get married and start our life together. My dad loved my fianc√© and was so excited for our wedding. He missed it, and we had to get married without him there. One of the happiest days of my life turned out to be one of the saddest as well. 

My dad‚Äôs birthday is two days after mine, and our birthdays are coming up next week and I‚Äôm dreading it. We always celebrated together, but he would always let me pick what I wanted to do and now I feel sad because I should have let him pick more often. I‚Äôd give anything to celebrate even one more birthday with him. 

I‚Äôve also been left with the weight of trying to manage and run the coffee shop that he owned, and it‚Äôs a job that I‚Äôve honestly always hated but now that he‚Äôs not there it‚Äôs just unbearable. I feel so trapped because it‚Äôs also my mom‚Äôs source of income so it has to keep going but the weight is so heavy. 

I feel like everything about who I am as a person is changing. All I feel now is anger, sadness, loneliness, and rage. I hate the person I‚Äôm becoming but I don‚Äôt have the energy to try to be better. I feel like I‚Äôm letting my dad down in every area. He would want me to be a better person but I‚Äôm just so angry and sad that he‚Äôs gone and I just can‚Äôt make myself care about anything. 

If you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you for reading. I know so many of you on this sub can understand what I‚Äôm feeling and honestly this sub has been a source of comfort. I‚Äôm sad that so many of us have to go through this but it‚Äôs also strangely comforting to know that I‚Äôm not alone.

1kj20pw,https://v.redd.it/0m5bshiftvze1,Who is using JetBrains + Cursor together ? I made a plugin to make switching between them less annoying.,"Not sure how common this is, but I often use both **JetBrains IDEs** and **Cursor** ‚Äî Cursor for its AI integration, and JetBrains for static analysis.

But there‚Äôs one small pain: every time I switch to Cursor, I have to reopen the file and scroll to the right line before i can ask the question.

Sure, it only takes about 8 seconds (on a good day), but if you do it often ‚Äî or land on the wrong file by mistake ‚Äî it can really break the flow.

So I built a small plugin for myself called **Code Portal** (available on the JetBrains Marketplace).

With one shortcut ‚Äî `Open In Cursor` ‚Äî it:

* Opens project and file in Cursor (also works with VSCode and Windsurf)
* Jumps to the exact line you were on
* Auto-selects the relevant code

I‚Äôve been using it daily, and it‚Äôs made things noticeably smoother.

If you jump between JetBrains and Cursor (or other VSCode-based editors) frequently, this plugin might help you too! Open to any feedback, suggestions, or roasts.

  
**‚ÄºÔ∏è Disclaimer:** It‚Äôs a paid plugin with a free trial. I offer a perpetual license at an affordable price ‚Äî if you find it useful, consider buying a license to support me. It really motivates me to keep improving it and helps cover some of my coffee ‚òï.  
  
üí° **Pro Tips**

* Set a keyboard shortcut to quickly jump to your preferred editor

""The Empty Cup Between Us""

She bloomed in front of me‚Äî
not all at once,
but in slow, spiraling truths
unspooled over the rim of her cup.

That caf√© on 5th,
chalk menus and clinking glass,
her choosing caramel-something
with a smile that didn‚Äôt quite fit her eyes.
I took mine black‚Äî
bitter, clean, and quiet.

We sat by the window
where the light made things look softer than they felt.
She started with harmless things:
a movie that disappointed,
a coworker‚Äôs laugh,
how morning traffic makes her feel invisible.

Then came the gravity‚Äî
her childhood tucked into metaphors,
the way her mother folded silence into casseroles,
the way her father taught her
to speak without expecting an echo.

Her words moved like weather‚Äî
gentle at first, then thunderous,
and I,
sat in the hush between clouds,
letting the rain say everything.

My coffee disappeared sip by sip,
each pause of hers
a chance to breathe her in.
Her cup stayed untouched,
steam swirling above it like smoke from a fire
she couldn‚Äôt put out‚Äî
not yet.

I think she knew.
That I wasn‚Äôt there to fix,
or weigh her pain against my own.
Only to be a place
where her voice could land
and not shatter.

By the time she stopped‚Äî
by the time the tremble softened
in her fingertips around the cup‚Äî
mine was long gone,
discarded, forgotten,
and hers was still mostly full,
still warm.

I had barely spoken.
But in that silence,
I‚Äôd never felt more heard.",1,1746851524.0,poetry_critics,4,1.0,False

1kj1sa8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEatsDrivers/comments/1kj1sa8/it_happened_again_coffee_kept_spilling/,"It happened again, coffee kept spilling","I deliver on a bike. I usually try to decline any orders with coffee in them. I've accepted one, and it went horribly. I have to bike about 5 km to the customer, the terrain is very hilly, and the road is filled with potholes, so the coffee ended up ripping through the paper bag, and it felt horrible, I felt like that was the start of when everything went wrong, because I still have nightmares about it.

Then it happened again today. It rained nonstop for three days straight. It was not strong, just a light drizzle, but the road was still very wet and bumpy. Usually, when an order has a drink in it, Uber will tell you with the little yellow square, but this time it didn't show up, and I accepted it, not knowing it had coffee in it.

I didn't check the details of the order, but by the time I went to the restaurant and slide to confirm the order, I realised that there was a large coffee in it, and it was two bags, the first one is the snacks and cakes and the second one was just coffee.

I don't even know what to do, the road was really slippery and I slid multiple times trying to brake. I could carry it with one hand, but I'm not sure if I can even bike like that in these weather conditions, and if I do, the rain would just make holes in the paper bag anyway, so I decided to do it anyway, I put the coffee and a heavier bag on top of the bag with coffee.

And of course, it spilt, I was having a panic attack in front of the customer's house, he came out and calmed me down, saying it will be alright, but I'm still very shaken by all of this. I already have three thumbs down (and one from a restaurant) due to extremely unlucky circumstances, and saying 'unlucky' would be an understatement. There isn't a single week that goes normally without any trouble, there just seems to be trouble and problems following me everywhere.

I feel really bad about the third unjustified customer's thumbs down, and now I feel even worse. I think I did my job decently until any order with coffee comes in, I feel so hopeless right now, I don't even know if the customer will give a thumbs down or not, because there was another customer who said 'don't worry about it' and proceed to give me thumbs down anyway. I'm not sure if my account will be alright within the following hours.

I can't find any job, I'm anxiety-ridden, and I'm autistic. Delivering food is my only way to survive, and I can't find any alternatives at all. I can't drive, and I don't even have any money to buy a car. I don't know what to do, is there any future for me? Every job and everything is so stressful.

I kind of want to decline any orders from a cafe, but Uber never tells you which order has hot drinks and which order has iced drinks (it just say 'order has drinks,' I'm based in Australia and it might be different anywhere else), because usually, iced drinks are properly sealed, but any hot drink will spill all over the place the moment I hit even the tiniest bump on the street. 

I would normally say, 'From now on, I will not accept any orders from a cafe whatsoever, and I will unassign myself if the order ends up having a coffee in it.' But I'm not even sure if there is even 'from now on.' Any hope for my future has all been lost. I want to get better and learn how to handle drinks, but I don't even know anymore.",3,1746850848.0,UberEatsDrivers,8,1.0,False
1kj1r57,https://www.reddit.com/r/etiquette/comments/1kj1r57/is_it_rude_or_polite_to_order_for_someone/,Is it rude or polite to order for someone?,"There‚Äôs some little demon inside me that defaults to thinking it‚Äôs polite to order for family members or romantic partners after you‚Äôve discussed what you‚Äôre all getting. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs something I picked up from my family growing up or just some specific etiquette neurons misfiring‚Äîwhen I think it all the way through it seems rude (I think?) but there‚Äôs just something in me that defaults to thinking it‚Äôs polite. My sibling and I both struggled with ridiculously bad social anxiety as kids so I was always thankful when people ordered for me, and in a family setting it‚Äôs common for us to have one person (usually my mom) act as sort of a liaison between all of us and the server just for efficiency‚Äôs sake, especially when we‚Äôre all sharing food. Anyway, my wife absolutely hates it when I order for them. Fwiw, we are lesbians (and they‚Äôre butcher than me) so it‚Äôs not gendered, there‚Äôs just something deeply ingrained in my brain that it‚Äôs actually a polite gesture and efficient for the server, especially when we‚Äôre planning to split everything and have agreed on what to get. The most egregious one was when they had been planning to order a salad and without a thought in my brain I ordered an entree for myself and a salad for my wife‚ÄîI was completely oblivious to why the waitress seemed so disgusted with me until my wife confronted me in the car later and I was HORRIFIED. Is it ever actually polite to do that? Thinking about it from the outside, I can‚Äôt imagine a situation other than a family-style dinner where that would be appropriate, so I don‚Äôt know why I keep defaulting to that. Separately, is it polite (or less impolite?) to do this when ordering together in a line (coffee shop, ice cream, etc.) if you‚Äôre the one paying? I can usually catch myself if we‚Äôre sitting down to eat, but ordering in a line like that still gets me‚Äîit just feels more efficient even if it really isn‚Äôt.",3,1746850731.0,etiquette,7,0.8,False

However, I had the interesting idea to make tattoo designs for the different songs in Foile A Deux. So far, I have ideas for; Disloyal Order, She's my Winona, Headfirst Slide, Coffee's for Closers, and w.a.m.s. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas for the others. I'm trying to kind of stick to chorus lyrics but if you can't, don't worry, neither could I.

Also mods, I'm sorry, I didn't know what to flair this.

We recently moved my 7m old daughter to big brother‚Äôs (3.5yo) room. They both sleep through the night and typically wake up at 7am, so when we were up for the day at 5:30am I knew it would be a looooong day.  

3 cups of coffee & many many MANY activities later and ‚Ä¶ my 3.5yo read 2 sentences for the first time & my 7m old crawled for the first time. Both milestones we‚Äôve been working on for some time.

I‚Äôm just so proud of them & grateful that I get to play such a pivotal role in their lives. 

We‚Äôre planning on homeschooling, & I‚Äôve been doing light lessons with my son for a minute. It‚Äôs so exciting to see him thriving in this way & fun to watch it click for him!
