Because we are close in age compared to others in our group we were always compared but I would always shut that down along with any shit talk because I believe that she is a truly brilliant and hard working person, but I am learning she feeds into it. 

Situation: We typically catch up once or twice a year when I visit my home state, but our most recent interaction left me feeling hurt. We grabbed coffee and shared life updates. She rightfully takes pride in her job and the financial benefits it provides,  and while I also am blessed to live the life I want comfortably, I don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking about financials the way she does and usually phrase things as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm loving the work that I do and the people I work with‚Äù. I recently got a new job and when I told this to her she immediately tried digging into what the financial situation was, asking about benefits, rent, the employer, and the positions level, which I would briefly answer then try to change to talk about personal life, but she kept on going back to interrogating me. Not once did she smile or ask about my personal life, it was very clear that she only wanted to meet to figure out how well I was doing in life in a non-supportive way, and it left me feeling like I‚Äôm just a benchmark to her. While I plan to keep her at arms length, I do not want to cut her off and would like advice on how to respond to this secret competitiveness. 


Some ideas/questions:
- continue to phrase things in terms of personal fulfillment
- when she tries to be competitive, congratulate her on living the life she wants
- how do I stop her from asking personal financial questions? 
-when she asks them, how do I answer without sharing details?

Thanks for any help!

TLDR: I learned someone I grew up with is secretly competitive and want advice on her to respond to her attempts at comparison and interrogation.",2,1735180797.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Except Nespresso has phased out some of my fave pods, and they‚Äôve increased prices a LOT. And, I originally bought the vertuo thinking I would use the coffee feature more than I do (I pretty much solely brew double espressos, whether double espresso dolce pods, using 2 altissimo pods, or doing the double tap trick on the seasonal coffee pods). 

For Christmas Costco had the pixie on a special, and I decided to get it. My vertuo machine is getting old and I‚Äôve noticed some inconsistency with volume of shots sometimes. Plus, Costco and Sam‚Äôs club sell original line pods for cheap, not to mention there‚Äôs more variety/exclusives available. I tried the pixie today, and I HATE it. The output of the espresso is nearly nonexistent (it‚Äôs soooo piddly, there‚Äôs nearly nothing there) and it‚Äôs quite loud and I‚Äôm admittedly less familiar with the pods/functions. Brewing two ‚Äúespresso‚Äù shots gives me a MUCH smaller volume than my vertuo does, and I‚Äôm not sure if I need to be using the lungo button, different pods, or if they‚Äôre just not comparable machines/shots.

Should I keep trying brewing methods/pods? Or should I return? Has anyone else had similar experiences switching from vertuo to original line?? Thanks!!

Edit: I used the scuro pods today (I‚Äôve had the double espresso scuro a bit with vertuo so I thought it would be a good comparison) and it also did not taste the same",1,1735179871.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False
1hmeqbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1hmeqbo/aiw_for_feeling_like_my_mother_totally/,AIW for feeling like my mother totally disrespected us and ruined our families christmas,"

I (40f) made christmas plans with my parents (66f) (68m)for them to come over for both Christmas eve and Christmas day. Christmas day they would stay until 3 pm because they had a 3 and a half hour ride home.  

A few days before christmas eve my sister (33f) (we haven't been on best terms) asked my mother what her plans were. My mother told me, so despite our strained relationship (figured it's time to let things go and make peace) I said I would invite her for christmas day and did. She said yes and the plans were made. 

We were originally going to do Chinese for dinner on christmas day but changed it once my sister was coming over because my parents said they would treat but changed it to me going half. (not my sister) We ended up buying a bunch of food to cook instead since that would be nicer. Christmas eve went smooth and my parents stayed in a hotel because that is what they like to do. 

The following day is where the disaster began. My parents were suppose to come at 9 am as the kids (19f,11m,8f,7f,) were waiting for them to open their presents under the tree and my mom loves watching and being involved. At 10 am i called my mom and this is where it all really started I informed my mother that my sister would not be making it over because her partner was ill throwing up since 4 am. I thought it was best since she was also nauseous (though not throwing up) she stay home and we make plans for another day when they aren't feeling ill. Mind you at this point it's been an hour and my mom had not even reached out to me about being late or anything.  

My mother totally lost it and flipped out on me. She went off the handle screaming on the phone how she was just going to go home. I ended the call here. A few minutes later she kept repeatedly calling me, my husbasnd and daughter, we didn't answer because we were trying to enjoy christmas with the kids. Like 15 min later i called my father because I felt at this point she was out of line and I had every right to inform my sister it's best since their sick that they stay home.  I hear my mother immediately yelling again. 

My father tells me they have to come to my house because after driving around all morning no restaurants were open and my mom needed to eat. It's a routine for them they always get breakfast out before coming to our house when they stay a night. My mother just likes eating out and uses any reason to do so even though I'm perfectly capable and willing to make food. So I agree and let her come. Apparently they stopped at 7 11 to get eggs as if I didn't have any... I really don't know why she does these things it feels insulting. So they both eat and she was upset the kids already opened the gifts when she said she wasnt coming and was already over an hour past 9 am, and then rushes to leave so they can get home by 4 for my sister to instead come to their house. 

Basically just blowing me and my family off leaving us with no christmas plans. They left in such a rush my oldest didn't even get to give her her christmas gift.  My oldest whose 19 was upset my younger kids were upset too. I felt this was extremely disrespectful and rude. I feel like they just came to eat and take thier chicken back that was going to be cooked today and take left over ham for my sister. And all of this because I didn't want someone knowingly sick in my house. So instead of staying until 3 on christmas day and arriving at 9 am they rushed to leave and left by 11ish am and first arrived 10 30 ish. She also had already celebrated the holidays with my sister a few weeks proir leaving us with no plans. We could have had my fil over for christmas day but didn't because they were suppose to be here and my mother doesn't like him. 

2 hours after she leaves she messages me saying the hot chocolate and other coffees she brought to my home and told my oldest daughter were for her, were for my sister. 

AIW for feeling my mother disrespected my family and myself with her actions?

I have owned this grinder for several months now, and many kg of coffee has gone through it, and every day I need to change the grind settings because my first espresso, or two, either flows too fast, or too slow. I put in 20g of beans each time.

I know this can happen if the type of bean changes, eg, PNG to Brazil, and I accept that, but for the same bean roasted a week earlier?

Is this typical of all grinders, because the bean characteristics changes day to day, and that's just how it is? Or is this how larger capacity grinders work, and I should buy a single dose grinder?

Okay I don't remember the specific months where I manifested all this so bear with me as this won't be in order.

  
1. Glowup--I had the most amazing glowup  this year(a  continuation from my 2023  manifestation and will continue as I want to manifest being even prettier) like legit heard I was hot, sexy and gorgeous way too many times, had me kicking my feets and twirling my hair. One girl (her first words when we actually talked together) said that every time she saw me walking, she wanted to talk to me because i'm such a baddie, you don't know how that brought such a smile to my face and one time I was being fake cocky with my friend going like 'i'm so gorgeous blah blah' and she was like 'you are tho'. Also more: So, when I was younger I use to have a weird obsession with kind of plucking my lashes, when I use to have very long thick lashes and this year I wasn't really manifested long lashes that much but my lashes grew so much still. 

  
2. Metabolism--I really fixed my metabolism thanks to manifestation this year. Like no matter how much I binge I never gain weight, I just maintain, and I don't get constipated the same way I used to get last year.

  
3. Fashion-- Now I am not yet done manifesting my dream closet, but I'm close enough. This year has been a huge fashion game changer for me and I mean this by a LOTT, I went to dressing like Idgaf about life to giving 90s-2010s sitcom it girl fits. Someone told me I always keep serving, and they want my closet and I get complimented on my outfits a lot like. When I went out with my friends yesterday and they saw a cute fit, they were like 'omg this is so you'  Honestly getting complimented on my fits is a never ending experience. (also got my dream white sweater  for christmas today)

  
4. Friends--Okay, so I came new to this place a year ago and I didn't have much of a stable friendgroup where we actually go out and hang out together and text often, but I've manifested a really close group of friends and being a floater. Me and my friends now hang out often, go to the malls, each other houses, grab a cup of coffee, send each other random memes.

  
5. Personality change-- I use to be a lot more introverted (I'm still a  little bit like that) before but now my introvert side kinda dying out and I'm becoming more outgoing, fun, and free spirited.

  
6. Money-- something weird keeps happening to me when it comes to money but that's probably my fault, but anyways I'm never broke. Like I always have money with me even when I use it all,  money comes and goes easily for me.

  
7. Already shared this one but grades--lately, i've been giving rory gilmore, annabeth chase, hermione Granger etc when it comes to good grades, like I've been doing so well academically and get rewarded for it. Lowest grade rn a 95 and the rest 99s-100s.

  
8. Jewelry: I didn't have that much jewelry before but now I have a lot of jewerly (especially earrings and necklaces/pendants. Also got more of them for Christmas) (Also off topic but not really, so as I'm writing this i'm scrolling through my pinterest board and I just realize the necklace I got for christmas looks almost exactly to the one I have pinned on my board, it's this one https://www.pinterest.com/pin/1010635972626892024/)

  
9.Okay this one was a stupid one, but I manifested seeing bright car colors--I wanted to test my skills and all that, so I just told myself I'll see unusual/bright car colors and I kept seeing very bright red and bright blue cars.

  
10. Travel--i grew up travelling a lot and don't really do it anymore, so  I manifested travelling again and I got news I'll travel next year.

  
11. Vision--I didn't manifest perfect vision, because though I do want 20/20 vision I'm kind of attached to my glasses (i like wearing my glasses to compliment my makeup I fear) but anyways when I saw that my vision was worsening, I quickly manifested it to get better and guess what happened, it got better!!

  
my 2025 goals: Glow up even more, height (the hardest to manifestüíî I want to grow taller so badly), awards, becoming very rich, continue with grades, all of my pinterest boards desires.

  
Anyways, would like to see everyone's recaps

","What do you think the best course of action would be to either fix (if fixable) this relationship or to safely leave it with the least amount of damage for both of us?

We‚Äôve been together 6 years. To put it bluntly I‚Äôve never been so miserable in my entire life and I‚Äôve been in extremely physically and mentally abusive relationships in the past. I feel like I‚Äôve lost my complete sense of self through the course of this relationship but to be fair other things have happened in the course of it as well (Covid, and the suicide of my long time best friend). 

My mental health has been declining rapidly. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being gaslit or if I‚Äôm gaslighting her or if we‚Äôre both just equally toxic or if it at all matters. 

We are both diagnosed with PTSD, borderline (mine is mostly in remission), depression, anxiety and she has really bad ADHD that significantly impacts her daily functioning (she doesn‚Äôt take her meds as prescribed because she sells some of them to make money). She has been unemployed for a couple years now and has been living off of an inheritance she got in 2020 but is down to about $6,000 and has been very nonchalant about taking action to find a job/income. I am truly afraid we will lose our housing. She pays her half of the rent and utilities. But aside from that, I am taking the brunt of other bills (gas, groceries, household items, everything our cats need, etc). 

One of my biggest frustrations and the cause of fights for years now is the imbalance in our relationship. I cook, I do the dishes, I clean, I wake up before her every morning to feed the cats/get them water/clean their boxes/give them their medicine, she won‚Äôt even get out of bed until I bring her coffee. I do all the grocery shopping. I keep track of what we‚Äôre running low on and make lists of what we need (groceries, cat food, litters, their meds, etc). I deep clean the cat boxes once a week. I change the trash. I break down the recycling and bring it to the basement. Etc. 
the whole six years I‚Äôve known her she‚Äôs cooked for me less than 5 times. She‚Äôs woken up before me less than 5 times. In the last two months she‚Äôs washed dishes maybe a few times. If I ask her she might bring the trash out. A lot of her not doing chores/forgetting is blamed on her ADHD. I am aware that this is a factor. I‚Äôve tried to be understanding of this but after awhile it feels like an excuse and cop out when I‚Äôm dealing with the worst treatment resistant depression of my life for about 5 years straight now to the point where I‚Äôm seeking alternative treatments (things aside from therapy and meds). 
When I was in the very beginning stages of grieving by best friends death she wouldn‚Äôt even wake up before me to help me with the cats. She wouldn‚Äôt cook me dinner. She wouldn‚Äôt wash the dishes. I could barely get out of bed but I HAD to because I love my cats and they‚Äôre dependent on us. She‚Äôd just lay in bed next to me. I asked her over and over to please help me in the ways I needed. She wouldn‚Äôt. 

I used to commute to work which turned my days into 12-13 hour days/5 days a week. The amount of work she‚Äôd put in around the house (mind you she still wasn‚Äôt working at this point) didn‚Äôt change. 

She is the most codependent person I‚Äôve ever met. I used to be independent. I loved (needed and still need as I‚Äôm a true introvert) my alone time. I used to love taking myself out on dates. Or just going to get my hair done alone. Some of the best times in my life were simple, solo weekend getaways for a night or two - just me. 

In this relationship, that sense of self is completely obliterated. She‚Äôs gotten to the point of crying when I‚Äôve told her I want to go to the store alone. I can‚Äôt even go to doctors appointments or hair appointments alone. To be fair, within the last couple months she‚Äôs been a little better and I have been able to do grocery shopping by myself which is my one escape from her aside from work. 
When I do have plans with just me and my sister (rare) it causes a huge emotional reaction in her. She becomes afraid and that fright turns into ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôd call it control or manipulation or guilting? Basically she tells me she‚Äôs afraid I‚Äôll die in a car accident or get roofied. The second I leave the house she starts texting me (while I‚Äôm driving - the irony) usually saying something to make me worried/feel bad, such as she thinks one of our cats is sick or acting off or that she‚Äôs really depressed, etc. she‚Äôll text me throughout the night.

She twists my words a lot. Or plays with my memories of events until I question everything that‚Äôs happened. Timelines, words, people involved, etc. I don‚Äôt know if she does it on purpose or not but I‚Äôve started taking notes on my phone so I can remember things she‚Äôs said/did so I don‚Äôt feel so crazy all the damn time. 

Our sex life has become nonexistent and I‚Äôll take the blame for this. I have no sexual interest in her. Even kissing or hugging her feels like I‚Äôm being assaulted. To be clear, she‚Äôd NEVER make me do anything I didn‚Äôt want to do. I just force myself to kiss her because I truly feel bad. But my body recoils and I have this trauma response. The idea of being sexual with her makes me feel physically ill. I‚Äôm attracted to her. We‚Äôve had great chemistry in the past. It‚Äôs not that. It‚Äôs just our relationship as a whole. It doesn‚Äôt make me want to be intimate with her. 
I see that this kills her and I feel horrible but I don‚Äôt know what do. 

I know this is A LOT. I apologize. I don‚Äôt have a lot of outlets. I do see a therapist. Sometimes I talk to my sister but she just wants me to up and leave her and it‚Äôs not that easy. 

My partner has basically told me she‚Äôd die without me and that our cats would too. 

I could really use some advice. Is there anything healthy or salvageable here. Anything I can improve upon. 

I‚Äôm considering couples counseling but I‚Äôm afraid the therapist will just read me like a book instantly and see I‚Äôm done. At this point I feel such disdain. Such anger. I‚Äôm irritable all the time. I‚Äôm mean to her. My words cut. I very rarely smile. I‚Äôm not innocent either. But I‚Äôm not who I used to be. I‚Äôm someone I‚Äôve never been in any other relationship. I feel like a shell. Leaving isn‚Äôt simple because neither of us could afford to live alone. Our cats are covid cats and unsocialized outside of me and her (and have health concerns) they‚Äôre both extremely attached to us both. I couldn‚Äôt rip them apart. And it would break my heart to ever take them from her. I don‚Äôt know what to do. ",0,1735179347.0,relationship_advice,3,0.33,False

I was recently diagnosed with inattentive ADHD and put on 30mg of vyvanse.  My psychiatrist scheduled me for a follow-up appointment 3 months later in mid January, due to closure over the holidays. 

When I first started taking vyvanse it worked well and had no side effects.  Then it seemed like it wasn't working enough, so I started taking 1x 80mg caffeine tablet in the mornings to help keep my energy up, and then would take vyvanse around midday. 

I would also drink approximately 500ml of Coca-Cola  throughout the evening, which has approximately 50mg of caffeine.  So all up I was having the equivalent of 2 cups of coffee per day. 

I should explain that I work nights (until 12:30pm) and my psychiatrist advised me to take vyvanse around lunchtime, so I didn't crash halfway through my work shift. 

I recently started taking iron and vitamin b supplements on the advice of my GP because I am deficient. 

Last week, I suddenly started feeling off.  My vyvanse crash was more intense, and it made me feel really strug out and anxious.  Then, the stomach symptoms happened. 

I started getting indigestion and felt really sick, like I was going to vomit all the time.  My head was spinning, I had no appetite, and I got hot flashes. I stopped the iron and caffeine and kept talking the vyvanse. 

Yesterday, I tried not taking vyvanse, but I still felt sick and then felt really tired and got a headache.

I have also lost about 7kg since starting the medication about 5 weeks ago. 

I know I should visit a doctor, but they are closed for the holidays. 

I just wanted to know if anyone else experienced similar symptoms on vyvanse and how you overcame them.  Or if you think it might have been the caffeine.

I‚Äôm the only one in the household who drinks coffee, not counting occasional parties with friends.

I‚Äôm not someone who experiments with multiple coffee beans or enjoys lengthy preparation routines. I realized that after having DF83v for a bit and while it‚Äôs adequate for grinding, just not fitting my preferred flow.  I buy one bag of coffee at a time, use it up, and move on to the next.

I care about quality, but don‚Äôt want to tinker with scales, burr adjustments. Simplicity in usage is key.

I‚Äôm open to all options across all price ranges, from entry-level to commercial-grade, as long as the product is durable and comes from a reputable brand known for quality. I want this to be the last  grinder I will ever need. 

Compactness is also important, as I have limited space for my coffee setup. Ideally, the grinder would offer grind-by-weight functionality and have a hopper size small enough to fit a standard 12-ounce bag of coffee.

In summary: I value simplicity of use, durability, and design, and I want a reliable, compact setup that fits my needs as a single coffee drinker without adding unnecessary complexity.

1hmecrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_Connect/comments/1hmecrg/how_vpns_enable_secure_remote_work_for_businesses/,How VPNs Enable Secure Remote Work for Businesses: My thoughts ,"The shift to remote work has been one of the most significant changes in the modern workplace. With more businesses adopting flexible work models, ensuring the security of company data and communications has never been more critical. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are a vital tool for protecting businesses and their employees when working remotely. By encrypting internet traffic and securing connections, VPNs ensure that sensitive information remains protected, no matter where employees are located. In this post, we‚Äôll explore how VPNs enable secure remote work for businesses and why they‚Äôre essential in today‚Äôs digital landscape.

1. What is a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet. When you connect to a VPN, all the data you send and receive is encrypted and routed through a remote server, making it difficult for unauthorized users, hackers, or third parties to access. For businesses, this means employees can safely access company resources, even when working from home or on the go.

Key Functions of a VPN:

Encryption: VPNs encrypt all data passing between the user‚Äôs device and the internet, making it unreadable to hackers or anyone trying to intercept the connection.

IP Masking: VPNs hide the user‚Äôs real IP address by replacing it with the IP address of the VPN server, ensuring privacy and anonymity.

Secure Access: VPNs allow employees to connect to company networks and resources securely, regardless of their location.

2. How VPNs Enable Secure Remote Work

2.1. Protecting Sensitive Data

One of the main benefits of using a VPN for remote work is data protection. Whether employees are accessing sensitive company files, communicating via email, or entering confidential information into a company system, VPNs ensure that this data is kept secure from cybercriminals. This is particularly important when employees use public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks, which are vulnerable to hacking.

How VPNs Protect Data:

End-to-End Encryption: VPNs use strong encryption (often AES-256-bit encryption) to ensure that all data transferred between devices and servers is unreadable to anyone intercepting it.

Secure Connections on Public Networks: Public Wi-Fi networks, such as those found in coffee shops, airports, or hotels, are notorious for being insecure. A VPN protects employees from threats like man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where hackers intercept communications to steal sensitive information.

2.2. Enabling Remote Access to Company Resources

Employees working remotely need access to the same company resources they‚Äôd use in the office, such as file servers, internal applications, and email. A VPN allows remote workers to securely connect to the company‚Äôs internal network, giving them access to these resources without putting company data at risk.

How VPNs Enable Remote Access:

Accessing Internal Networks: A VPN allows employees to connect to the company‚Äôs network securely from any location, just as if they were physically in the office.

File Sharing and Collaboration: VPNs ensure that all files shared between remote workers and internal resources are encrypted, protecting intellectual property and confidential documents from unauthorized access.

2.3. Securing Communication Channels

Remote workers rely on digital communication tools, including email, video conferencing, and instant messaging, to collaborate and interact with colleagues. While these tools are necessary for remote work, they can also present security risks if not properly protected. VPNs encrypt online communications, ensuring that sensitive discussions and company information remain private.

How VPNs Secure Communication:

Encrypted Communication: VPNs encrypt all communication data, making it secure even when using communication platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Slack.

Preventing Eavesdropping: By using a VPN, employees can prevent hackers from intercepting voice calls, video meetings, or messaging conversations.

2.4. Enforcing Security Policies Across All Devices

Employees working remotely often use personal devices (such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets) to access company systems. These devices may not always have the same level of security as those used in the office, which could leave the business vulnerable to cyber threats. A VPN can help enforce security policies across all devices by ensuring that all traffic is routed through a secure connection, no matter what device is being used.

How VPNs Enforce Security:

Device Compatibility: VPNs are compatible with a wide range of devices, from desktops to mobile phones, ensuring that remote workers‚Äô devices are always protected.

Centralized Control: Businesses can manage and control VPN access across all devices, making it easier to monitor employee activity and enforce security policies.

2.5. Preventing Data Leaks and IP Exposure

When remote workers access the internet without a VPN, their IP address can be exposed, revealing their location and making them susceptible to cyberattacks. Furthermore, data leaks can occur when sensitive information is accidentally exposed to unauthorized parties. A VPN prevents these issues by masking the user‚Äôs IP address and encrypting all transmitted data.

How VPNs Prevent Data Leaks:

No IP Address Exposure: VPNs mask users' real IP addresses, ensuring that their physical location and identity remain private.

Leak Protection: Many VPNs come with DNS leak protection and IPv6 leak protection to prevent accidental exposure of user data, ensuring that all traffic stays within the encrypted VPN tunnel.

3. Benefits of VPNs for Businesses

3.1. Compliance with Privacy Regulations

Many industries are subject to privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), HIPAA (for healthcare), or PCI-DSS (for payment card data). Using a VPN helps businesses meet compliance standards by securing their employees‚Äô communications and data, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring privacy.

3.2. Cost-Effective Security Solution

Setting up a secure remote working environment can be costly, especially if you need to invest in expensive hardware and software solutions. VPNs offer an affordable way to provide secure remote access for employees without requiring significant infrastructure. VPN subscriptions are typically less expensive than building and maintaining private networks or complex security systems.

3.3. Scalability for Growing Teams

As businesses grow and more employees work remotely, a VPN can easily scale to accommodate additional users and devices. VPN providers often offer flexible plans that can support businesses of all sizes, making it easy to add new team members or expand to different locations without compromising security.

4. Choosing the Right VPN for Business Use

Not all VPNs are created equal. When selecting a VPN for your business, there are a few key factors to consider:

4.1. Security Features

Look for a VPN with strong encryption (like AES-256-bit) and a no-logs policy.

Ensure the VPN provider offers DNS leak protection, kill switches, and other advanced security features.

4.2. Speed and Reliability

Choose a VPN provider with fast and reliable servers to ensure smooth operations, especially if your team is involved in high-bandwidth activities like video conferencing and file sharing.

4.3. Scalability

Ensure the VPN provider can scale with your business as it grows. Look for a provider that allows easy addition of new users and devices.

4.4. Customer Support

A business VPN should come with 24/7 customer support to quickly address any issues that may arise.

5. Conclusion

In today‚Äôs world, where remote work is becoming the norm, ensuring the security of your company‚Äôs data and communications is more important than ever. VPNs are a crucial tool for businesses, enabling remote workers to access company resources securely and privately, no matter where they are. With strong encryption, secure remote access, and the ability to enforce security policies across all devices, VPNs provide businesses with a cost-effective and reliable solution for securing remote work environments.

If your business is transitioning to remote work, investing in a high-quality VPN is one of the best ways to protect your data, maintain privacy, and ensure that your employees can work securely from anywhere.

Spending a few days with immediate family and partners. My Dad, his partner, and my eldest sister all know I don't drink, with varying levels of support and treatment of this. The others (BIL, other sis, step-bro, his GF) don't know but only because I never really talk to them.

Well we are doing Bad Santa (I think it's called white elephant in the states?), and my turn comes. I pick something l, it's a great big wooden chopping board, the sort of thing I'd actually been looking to buy soon because mine are too small. I'm over the moon, it's perfect, I started going on about how happy I am.

Well of course it gets stolen by the next person, whatever, that's the game. I pick a new present, open up the bag, my heart fucking drops.

Bottle opener, shot measurer thing, wine bottle stand. I take them out and show everyone, trying to force a smile because it's a gift after all, I can always re-gift it. My big sis looks at me, leans over her husband and whispers ""I'll steal that off you."" What a fucking legend looking out for her baby bro.

Anyway, I'll be leaving in an hour or so, and I made it through 3 days without touching booze, including skipping the tiramisu which my dad's partner (who knew I didn't drink) decided to use Kahlua with instead of coffee.

Now I'm refreshed and sober, looking forward to the 2 hours on the train reading The Count of Monte Cristo instead of wondering if I'll need to jump off at the next stop to vomit.

I will not drink with you this boxing day

Part 21.2- Bear with me,"Part of a few short stories, with the intentional purpose of exploring a group of ""branches"", or ""test sites"", that have developed a new branch of Azur Lane dedicated to fight landbased Siren forces.

Summary

The Commander has found himself at the research facility, along with some of his friends and people from his inner circle within Azur Lane, but no matter how much more information each one brings, more questions are brought up. Especially the questions regarding the misterious bear rigging, which they have yet to ascertain who it belongs to or when they might have arrived to the base. Those questions remain unclear until Chkalov decides to make some time and give a -brief- explanation of what they have been working on.

[Previous Part](https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/1hjpm7f/siren_thesis_part_211_bear_with_me/) \- 

////

# Chapter 2: Theoretically explaining.

Just when they decided to go and have a word with the girls from the research department, in order to have them take some sort of break, as well as getting a better explanation out of them, more people started showing up at the research room.

The next one to open the door was Bismarck, getting everyone‚Äôs attention as she made her way towards the Commander, politely greeting everyone present.

‚ÄúCommander, everyone.‚Äù She greeted, nodding at the Commander and then at everyone else, before coming to a sudden stop.

‚ÄúEr, who is this child? I don‚Äôt recognize him.‚Äù Bismarck stated, looking slightly confused by the presence of the metallic bear that remained seated by the Commander‚Äôs left side.

Bismarck got closer to the bear until she got its attention, as it looked at her, she simply stopped, looked at it in the eyes, and rather than trying to reach it, she nodded at it and did nothing more.

Everyone had halted what they were saying or doing in order to take a look at the interaction, to be able to witness the moment in which the spiritual Leader of the Iron Blood made a rigging acknowledge her, it was not something someone was able to simply see just any day.

Even if it was sometimes one of the most mundane events to take place in Azur Lane.

In response to her gesture, the bear simply nodded back, as if greeting her, she did nod back minutely in turn again, being well acquainted with how to treat even the rowdiest of riggings, or the rowdiest rigging owners for that matter.

‚ÄúEr, we don‚Äôt really know.‚Äù The Commander said, looking at the bear as well ‚ÄúThe girls here seem to be all over the place, we haven‚Äôt gotten a straight answer out of them since we arrived.‚Äù

The Commander told Bismarck, who in response furrowed her brows.

‚ÄúI have come as requested.‚Äù She said with some manner of discomfort evident. ‚ÄúBut now I worry about the girls here though, they seemed to have requested for Z23 to attend as well. As you know, she is on a trip with her friends. I thought this was well known through the base, given her important role as one of your attendants. Yet somehow, they asked for her to be present.‚Äù

The Iron Blood leader said, earning a few furrowed brows as well as quizzical looks from those present. Z23 and her friends were well known by everyone at the base, they were a bright and cheerful bunch, their friendship was a reminder that mutual help and trust on each other was possible regardless of their past or which faction they belonged to.

Even some of the Azur Lane human personnel who had some sort of initial doubts against the Kansen had quickly developed a soft spot for the four cheerful destroyers.

As such, it was more or less unthinkable that someone would have completely missed them not being in the base. Especially a multi-factional team such as the one from the research department.

As they were wrapping their heads regarding such a colossal slip from their friends, which only made everyone more concerned about their current state, the door to the room opened once more making everyone turn to see who was the next one to come in.

The one that showed up at that moment was one of the Commander‚Äôs trusted secretaries, Helena.

‚ÄúAh, Commander, everyone. I‚Äôm glad to see you could attend. The girls made it sound like this meeting was rather important.‚Äù

Helena made her way towards the group, nodding in acknowledgement to everyone in the room and sharing a quick hug with a few of them as well. She only stopped once she was in front of the Commander, she¬† had halted her movements as soon as she noticed the bear beside the Commander.

‚ÄúEr‚Ä¶ good day to you‚Äù She said tentatively towards the bear, bowing minutely towards it, a polite and neutral gesture that worked wonders on the multinational environment of Azur Lane.

In response the bear nodded back in acknowledgement, then it looked at her, holding her gaze for a couple of seconds, before looking to the side as if content with the exchange.

‚ÄúEr, ok then. Commander! Here, take a look at this‚Äù she said, giving him a clipboard she was carrying.

‚ÄúThis all seemed to be all over the place, so I thought you might want to check on this. The research department sent us two lists of people for this gathering.‚Äù She stated as she pointed at the first page on the clipboard.

Quickly looking at the paper, the Commander quickly realized that all the people listed were either people from his inner circle, or people with whom he had developed strong bonds one way or another, as Lieutenant Yannis‚Äôs presence indicated.

‚ÄúMost of the people in the first list confirmed they would attend, with some of them still obviously yet to arrive‚Äù She said after looking at those currently present.

‚ÄúMost were able to make changes to their previous arrangements to come, with the exception of people not currently present on base. Although we were told to try and convince the people there to ‚Äòcome back as fast as possible for this‚Äô, even though that was simply unrealistic.‚Äù

At the mention of that, everyone‚Äôs thoughts went back again to the mentioned slipup regarding Z23. Now it was obvious she was not the only one requested to be present that was way out of reach.

‚ÄúWait, you mentioned there were two lists of people, Helena.‚Äù King George said, one finger to her lips as she was taking mental note of what the Commander‚Äôs secretary had said.

‚Äúer‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ the second list is‚Ä¶ a bit different‚Ä¶ this is a list of the -must not attend-‚Äù she said wincing at the mention of this.

The Commander raised an eyebrow at this, echoing a shared feeling regarding such a statement.

‚ÄúThat- Just‚Ä¶ let me take a look at this list.‚Äù The commander flipped onto the next page, to look at the second list of people that Helena had given him on the clipboard.

As the commander went over the names, his expression became troubled at first, when he had finished it, he actually seemed to have become somewhat tired.

‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ this is bad, if anyone within the list gets to see it, it would surely mean trouble.‚Äù

‚ÄúI agree, Commander‚Äù Helena stated. ‚ÄúThere is only one copy of this, I wanted to show it to you, once this endeavor has taken place, I am to destroy this piece of evidence‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have taken measures so that the people listed here won‚Äôt be attending, we requested assistance from people that can be discreet about such a thing, while helping us to keep them busy as well.‚Äù

Helena made such an assurance with a solemn tone that disquieted more than one among those present. Her words had created such a concern, that even the usually composed Enterprise moved closer to the Commander to take a look at the list, to which in turn he simply gave her the clipboard for her to look at it at her own leisure, making a gesture with his hand towards everyone else, indicating that it was not an issue to share it among those present.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ Yes, I agree. This would surely create some friction to say the least.‚Äù She said.

‚ÄúCare to give us a hint about it, Enterprise?‚Äù King George said as she turned to look at the Union carrier.

For her part, Enterprise handed the clipboard to Belfast, who had remained beside King George, which in response nodded minutely and put the document in front of king George while standing by her side, so the two of them could see their contents.

‚ÄúSeems to be composed of every girl out here that has a‚Ä¶ Passionate‚Ä¶ personality.‚Äù Enterprise said after she found some more tactful words to convey her thoughts on the matter.

‚ÄúIt seems to be composed of every woman in this base that would still openly make a quarrel regarding your marriage with the Commander.‚Äù King George said dryly.

‚ÄúWell, honestly that sounds like a reasonable list to have for most events, just common sense to veer away from the yanderes at this point‚Äù Lieutenant Yannis with a dry chuckle.

There was a snort in response at that, it was soon followed by a couple snickers, it was a very unladylike snort that came from an unexpected source, which as a result made more of them laugh back, a result of those currently present being quite comfortable with each other. But aside from that no one seemed to prepare themselves to refute his words.

The Commander simply grunted in response to that. Even after being married to both Enterprise and Belfast there were a few of the girls that refused to treat him differently, some for the better, a handful for the worse.

He had never intended to become some sort of heartbreaker, nor he had pushed any sort of advances on them. He had been clear to them that he had no intention to pursue them in either a romantical nor a physical way, but that hadn‚Äôt deterred them, nor it seemed like they were willing to listen to him. From his perspective they all had developed extreme fixations on him as well as some degree of lovesickness. He had personally seen experts as well as talked with their friends and family about various ways to help them.

That was the very least he could do, otherwise he felt like he was robbing them of the opportunity to have a full life, with him being sort of an obstacle by not being part of their lives.

¬†

‚ÄúI think we are getting more questions rather than answers out of this‚Äù Belfast said, interrupting everyone‚Äôs thoughts on the subject.

She had obviously sensed how the subject had troubled him, as per usual he felt quite troubled regarding this particular matter. In such times he always felt blessed by the support of his friends as well as his wives.

‚ÄúOh! I think this is more than enough people to give the first explanation.‚Äù Chkalov had arrived while everyone was preoccupied with the list of people that Helena had brought, surprising everyone by seemingly appearing out of nowhere.

She stood and eyed everyone without saying anything else, with her hands in the pockets of her coat, she nodded a couple times acknowledging something she had yet to speak of.

‚ÄúIdeally the little booklets should provide all the information, saving us the time to give an explanation. But that‚Äôs unrealistic, as there is always room for some misinterpretation. Waiting for everyone to be present, in order to explain things only once, would be also quite unlikely, especially when time is such an issue. So, I believe our goal is to only explain things twice, thrice tops, with a misunderstanding rate on the minimum.‚Äù

Chkalov explained, but it seemed more or less like she had explained things mostly to herself, as her focus had slipped at some point and it looked like she had begun making calculations on how to best solve an issue, in this case, the issue of how to repeat oneself the least.

‚ÄúEr‚Ä¶ care to explain‚Ä¶ more in, uh, layman terms?‚Äù Lieutenant Yannis said.

‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs a great idea too!‚Äù Chkalov said excitedly.

‚ÄúWell, you see, the thing is, we seem to be running out of time. Or rather, things will get complicated the more time we allow to pass‚Äù She said as she shook her head with her hand at her temple.

‚ÄúThat fellow over here‚Äù She gestured towards the metallic-bear-rigging who had remained besides the Commander. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the praetor cube that Doctor Bethencourt gave to the Commander.‚Äù

Her words shocked everyone present, resulting in everyone looking at the bear once again and then looking back at the Northern parliament girl, to make sure she wasn‚Äôt pulling a fast one on them.

‚ÄúHave to give it to him, the doctor is both a genius as well as a madman. He discovered the way to prepare an -adaptative wisdom cube matrix-‚Äù Chkalov said as she gestured with her hands as if clomping together several cubes floating in the air onto a smaller space.

‚ÄúThe objective of the praetor cube is to anchor itself to the -concept- of whoever is to be the final user and then function like an external armor that holds various capabilities similar to those of a Kansen.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least that is the simplified version he himself described in his papers. We have gone through those extensively, we did not want to leave anything to chance, especially after the first accident happened‚Äù

Chkalov gestured towards the bear again, who in turn seemed content to simply be mentioned.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that? There have been no reports of any emergencies in the research department‚Äù Helena stated, obviously bothered by the idea of an accident having happened within the base, holding her gaze on Chkalov.

‚ÄúOh, it was not that kind of accident‚Äù Chkalov responded while gesturing vaguely around the place.

‚ÄúAs we tried to analyze the Praetor cube, in order to find out if it was safe to even consider making use of it, and making sure it held no possible backdoors to exploit an easy access to the Commander, the cube started reacting to the equipment we were using as well as to our prodding. In the end the cube absorbed the equipment as well as the table it was on along with anything that was stored in the table‚Äôs compartments.‚Äù

At that she gestured for them to follow her, leading them closer to the tables in the lab room, grabbing a mug of coffee that was sitting on the table and then she gestured at the area right next to it, one area much more open than the rest. Now that everyone was paying attention to what she was saying, marks of furniture emplacement became evident, holes for where one of the metallic tablets would be safely held on the ground.

‚ÄúThat was a response of the cube attempting to synchronize with its surroundings, in turn absorbing the table along with various gadgets and books that were stored on that table. Most of those were from the motherland, which in turn resulted in it looking as it does right now.‚Äù

Everyone eyed the bear, who in return just nodded, as if agreeing with everything that had been said. The bear really looked the part of a Northern Parliament rigging, and after hearing Chkalov‚Äôs explanation, it made some sort of sense, if it could adapt to the user, it would reflect some traits of the user in the same way that riggings would show traits and parts of a Kansen‚Äôs vessel.

‚ÄúGiven the many possibilities, this was not an -ideal- result, as we could have arranged for a combined influx of influences for it to take shape. But my personal bias is that this is a good outcome, nonetheless. It has the commanding look of a northern Parliament Rigging, as well as the responsiveness of one.‚Äù

Chkalov took a sip of her coffee at that, seemingly lost in her thoughts for a second.

‚ÄúIt would have been interesting to see something less ‚Äòorganic‚Äô, like a rigging from the eagle union, but that would have created issues about compatibility between a living being and a ‚Äòmachine rigging‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I digress‚Ä¶‚Äù She said after taking another sip at her coffee ‚ÄúSimply put, the more time that the praetor cube remains untethered to the Commander, the greater the chances for it attach itself to someone else or even worse, to get the wrong idea of who the Commander is, either by simple hearsay or by the treatment it receives by us, which is reflective of the Commander and how he handles situations. Think of it as getting the wrong first impression by not being present, even if it was not his fault‚Äù

‚ÄúSay, if it has come to this, why not ask for Doctor Bethencourt for assistance? He was the creator of this after all.‚Äù Lieutenant Yannis said, to which a few of them nodded their heads while others remained pensive on the question.

‚ÄúWell, there are a couple reasons.‚Äù Chkalov said as she lifted two fingers ‚ÄúFor starters, since this involves the Commander, we didn‚Äôt want to leave such an important role to someone who is foreign to Azur Lane, to us. He created it, as such he could be able to slip by any new backdoor or malicious influence without us being able to do anything about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe second is that he really doesn‚Äôt know the Commander, we are sure he has ways to overcome the problem with synchronizing to the concept of the Commander, but there are guarantees it would lead to the best result either.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is also the matter of our pride as researchers and scientists, but we will not count that towards our main reasons.‚Äù She said much more quietly, almost like a secondary thought that had slipped past her lips.

‚ÄúWe made some plans regarding the best way to allow it to synchronize with you, comrade. Due to its high adaptability, our main concern was that it would try to anchor itself with a -¬†*you*¬†\- that does not exist in the real world.‚Äù

‚ÄúEr‚Ä¶ can you elaborate on that?‚Äù The Commander asked, sharing a confused sentiment among most people present.

‚ÄúYes, of course, it is highly convoluted, honestly. The Praetor cube will not really¬†*synchronize*¬†with the user. In order to respond to his movements and commands, it will link itself to the very concept of being part of the person it will be making use of. A solution evidently brought by someone who specializes in the field of bringing forth concepts into existence, really.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe problem lies in anchoring the praetor cube to the concept of the person.‚Äù She said sighing, putting her fingers on her temple as if suddenly hit by a bothersome subject

‚ÄúIt needs to link itself to the concept of who the Commander is. Here lies the problem, if we establish a wrong concept it will fail to respond, since it will be linked to the concept of a different person who is the Commander yet it is -not- the Commander.‚Äù

She said while gesturing towards the Commander, stopping in the middle of her explanation only to take another sip at the coffee, scrunching her nose as she looked at it, placing the mug back on the table.

‚ÄúI assume you were intrigued by the second list of people we sent.‚Äù Chkalov said as she pointed at the paper sheet that had made its way back to Helena‚Äôs hands.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt come to that list out of spite, nor to spurn anyone.‚Äù Chkalov shook her head, obviously somewhat troubled by that idea.

‚ÄúThis is an additional problem we foresaw. If the praetor cube gets the wrong information regarding the Commander, and who he is, the whole anchoring process would surely fail. Since it will be trying to make a connection with someone like the Commander yet different to him.¬†

‚ÄúThe people we asked to be present today are those closest to Comrade Commander. His friends,‚Äù She said as she gestured at Lieutenant Yannis and King George.

‚ÄúHis confidants, his family, his spouses.‚Äù Chkalov now gestured towards Bismarck, Helena, Belfast and Enterprise in the same order as she explained things.

‚ÄúWe need all of you present to establish the concept of who the commander is, the actual commander, the one that loves and fights for his friends and family, the one that is a human that makes mistakes, that overworks himself when he is anxious, the one that we can confide with, the one we trust, and cherish.‚Äù

Chkalov said the last part, blushing slightly and looking a bit to the side, as if trying to avoid the looks of everyone as she explained herself.

‚ÄúWhile the perception of those in the second list is quite positive, it is not exactly who the commander truly is.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù Belfast broke the silence that had befallen them ‚ÄúIf Akagi was to be present, the Praetor cube would try to look for a Commander that‚Äôs greater than life, one that would set all his enemies ablaze and then conquer the world.‚Äù

More than one person grimaced at that. It was a spot-on analysis of how Akagi perceived the commander, and what she wanted of him as well. But everyone present was aware that Erick Anderson was much more than a successful commander.

‚ÄúEr, one question.‚Äù The Commander said towards Chkalov, for her part Chkalov nodded in response waiting for him to continue.

‚ÄúYou seemed to have reached an epiphany when I mentioned the bear being a rigging. What was that about? Wasn‚Äôt that part of all of this?‚Äù

‚ÄúMm‚Ä¶ Yes, more or less. We found an issue we could not just quite overcome.‚Äù She said as she twirled her hand as if trying to dispel that particular issue.

‚ÄúDoctor Bethencourt made no attempts setting up a way for you to have a -conversation- with the cube, to come to an agreement with the Praetor cube. As such, there are no traces of established commands, such as ways to command the usage of weapons, but the foremost example that comes to mind is the total lack of a way to remove the Praetor cube armor from the user.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt seemed like an inconceivable mistake, but the more we thought about it we came to a different resolution. From what we figure, the Doctor‚Äôs affinity with wisdom cubes is so high that they simply become subservient to him, he can have any of his wishes be granted by the wisdom cubes, there is no room for dialogue.‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, I don‚Äôt see an issue with that.‚Äù Lieutenant Yannis said, while everyone else seemed to be chewing the argument. ‚ÄúAside from the whole -removing the cube-? Would it become a permanent part of the Commander?‚Äù

‚ÄúTheoretically, that would not be a problem. One would normally wish for their weapons to simply do what one wishes for them to do, or carry a coveted weapon with them all the time. But that is also something that does not align with the values and personality of the Commander, especially if said -weapons- happen to have a will and personality of their own. Also, while the Commander‚Äôs affinity with wisdom cubes is particularly high, we are not convinced it is on the same level as that of Doctor Bethencourt, as such it is quite possible he would not be able to have his orders be accomplished properly.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is why the Commander‚Äôs misunderstanding came like a revelation. If we modify the Praetor cube‚Äôs base functions ever slightly, it can work much like a rigging, being part of the Commander while at the same time being independent of him. Being able to accomplish tasks on his own with only a request by the Commander.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù The Commander said intelligently, echoing everyone‚Äôs thoughts on the matter.",1,1735177145.0,AzureLane,0,0.6,False

1hmdu76,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1hmdu76/vyvanse_apathy_appetite_suppression_and_tiredness/,"vyvanse apathy, appetite suppression and tiredness?","Hey guys,

I recently started Vyvanse 30mg a week ago due to Ritalin LA giving me physical numbness which thankfully doesn't happen with Vyvanse for me. However, since starting my already low appetite is basically gone and I've been feeling quite apathetic in social settings.

The main improvements I've noticed are in my time blindness, cravings, emotional dysregulation and racing mind. I can do things without hours flying by, I don't crave bad food or really any at all, and my mind is very nice and quiet. I have noticed a significant improvement in stress, I think I was managing my ADHD symptoms by stressing myself out over everything. However, I feel like I have a brain fog that I thought could be me adjusting to the medication, but I did switch straight over from Ritalin (and so have been on stimulant meds for about 3 and a half weeks)

Before meds I always had a lot bursts energy, on top of having an overall high amount of energy and my mind would always be racing. I also was very motivated or passionate in my music and stuff but now I just do it and don't get any 'rush of dopamine' or whatever, maybe this is normal as I normally act on these large bursts of inspiration and energy. Ultimately I am more pleased and fulfilled with what I produce on medication as I can stick to what I'm doing easier, it's just strange not feeling things so intensely and acting on that rush.

I've also been feeling tired in the day which I don't usually feel unmedicated (although I used to drink around 2 cups of coffee a day, now I only drink decaf). I've even been able to nap which was Impossible unmedicated.

My psychiatrist told me to increase my dose as I would like (by opening the capsules) without exceeding 70mg after being on 30mg for 2 weeks, but I'm worried this could worsen the appetite suppression and apathy. 

Has anybody had a similar experience, and if so how did you go about addressing these problems? Did you notice any further changes in appetite on higher doses? Ideally I would like to have more energy whilst maintaining this quiet mind. It would also be nice to have a little bit of motivation and better task initiation.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I appreciate any feedback.

tdlr: Had a deeply caring 3 year relationship. Should we risk a friendship or just accept the fate as failed lovers?

Hey there, so I have read a bunch of takes on this on different platforms and read loads of opinions, but I do feel like they were not specific enough, so here we go. 




What is your take on being friends with an ex who broke up with you after a 3 year relationship? [now both 19]

We both cared really deeply for each other, started off with a flirty friendship, which the dumper initiated back then and  we decided to commit to a relationship. Three years and a break up later I can say, goddam we had a beautiful time together. Especially the non sexual parts, we‚Äôre just truly stunning. 

The last three month of the relationship were hard on the both of us. I struggled with the lack of sexual intimacy and she felt a lot of pressure on herself, which turned into unhappiness and her deciding to end the relationship, while I was still believing that we could fix our problems. It wasn‚Äôt something out of the blue, and still it was so damn emotional for the both of us when we talked about it. We were both very big on communication and transparency and had a talk two weeks after the break up, to exchange thoughts on the relationship. After that we went 5 weeks no contact, as I needed space. 

6 week post break up, we meet up for a coffee and talked about our upcoming futures and things that happened during no contact. I was really not expecting it, but I genuinely enjoyed the time and was so so happy for her when she told me that she hit her gym milestone. It is this feeling of being proud of her, which I have never felt for anyone else before. It is the feeling of wanting her to be happy and succeeding in life. It is the feeling of her still listening to my problems, responding fast to my messages and being there for me. I don‚Äôt feel the need to kiss her or anything, but rather to hug her in a friendly way. 

These things keep me wondering if we could have a good, non sexual, but still caring and (platonic love) friendship with each other? So what is your guys take on this and what could go negative here?",2,1735176698.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

One uncle (let‚Äôs call him Kevin) has 4 kids and before covid he and his wife separated (still married tho) and she took the youngest (let‚Äôs call him Bob) to a different country leaving her other three kids behind. The dad also decided to leave the country and is now constantly traveling leaving his kids behind. The eldest (23) has been living somewhere else for years and is doing well I believe. The second oldest (21) has gotten in lots of trouble with the police and stuff (for drugs and stealing and stuff) and the second youngest (16/17 I think) has been left on his own and honestly has the most brain cells in the family. Anyways, all three boys have a massive ego and most of the time only come to my granny to eat, sleep and treat her as a space. (Literally). The uncles have a business together and Kevin has already said he‚Äôll pull out of the business if anyone tells my granny the truth. So my granny doesn‚Äôt really know anything and loves all three of them no matter what they do. 
The other family is my uncle (let‚Äôs call him Fred), his wife and two kids. They‚Äôre okay a little weird but not too bad I suppose. 

Soo, yesterday my mum and I invited all of them over for coffee and cake and cookies at 4.30pm. We explicitly said no food will be served (as in real food like a hot meal) as we have made the experience lots of times of Kevin‚Äôs kids inhaling everything and then leaving a massive mess to clean up. At 3.30 the door bell rings, the two youngest of Kevin have arrived way too early. The dad is shortly behind them smiling like he‚Äôs just won the lottery. 

They come in, not saying hello or even acknowledging the fact my parents or I are there. The second youngest (let‚Äôs call him Luca) goes upstairs to look after the fish tank and clean it while his younger brother (let‚Äôs call him Julian) whines to my granny about how he‚Äôs hungry and wants food. He sits down at the set table and starts munching on some chocolates that are on it while complaining that there is no real food around. My granny than starts telling him about the food I have prepared for dinner and how he could eat that and then turns to me telling me to go get some. It took me forever to prepare my granny‚Äôs favourite meal so I say no and Julian raises his voice tell me to do as my granny says since it‚Äôs her house. I deny again telling him I bought and prepared the food so she theoretically has no say over it. This continues back and forth for a while until I get up to get the coffee and tea started as it‚Äôs like 15-20 minutes till my second uncle is supposed to come. 

Once in the kitchen I start doing the stuff to get hot drinks and Julian joins me, opening the fridge and pulling out food. I turn and tell him he better not start eating the food in the fridge as I have bought most of it and need it for dinner. He again starts yelling about how I‚Äôm not allowed to tell him what to do and how I should shut up or leave as I am running the whole mood. 
I shut the fridge door and leave the kitchen as there‚Äôs no point in fighting. My mum comes into the kitchen at this stage and tells him to leave the fridge alone and so does his dad. His dad even told him and us that he had a massive lunch at home so he should be fine waiting for the cake and cookies. Julian then  leaves the kitchen pretty annoyed to go upstairs to his brother. 

I‚Äôm back in the living room but I can hear my mum and uncle talk about the wine we have bought. My dad works in the beverage industry so he knows a lot and calls my uncle out on some bullshit and my uncle (being as he is) continues denying that my dad knows stuff and proceeds to get louder about it. I ask him to quiet down a bit and to just let it go as it is just wine. He then tells me to shut up as I am not an adult and he won‚Äôt be talked to that way and goes back into the kitchen. Loudly trashtalking me to my mother, who then says well your kids aren‚Äôt any better than that. Julian heard that and proceeds to literally scream into my mums ear, making my mum leave the kitchen and going downstairs to the pantry to grab something. Kevin still hasn‚Äôt let the wine conversation go and proceeds to shove his phone into my dads face while complaining about the wine choice my dad has made and my dad asks him to let it go but he won‚Äôt. Kevin keeps talking louder so I speak up again, asking him not to basically shout and to just let the wine talk be as my dad would know his beverages as it‚Äôs literally his job. He turns to me literally screaming at me that I‚Äôm not allowed to talk to him and that‚Äôs I‚Äôm just a stupid girl. Julian then appears behind me shouting at me aswell while raising his hand threatening to hit me. I ask them both to quiet down as there‚Äôs no need for shouting as we are all adults here. But instead they keep getting louder, my dad even tried to intervene but they will literally not stop shouting at me. 

My granny then comes downstairs and yells at us to stop shouting (eventhough I wasn‚Äôt even shouting I even asked my parents and they confirmed I was talking in an inside voice) and then she proceeds to defend my uncle and cousins as I obviously did something wrong intervening in their adult talk. All the while Julian and Kevin are both threatening to hit me and are still shouting so now there‚Äôs three people shouting at me. I again ask them to quiet down as there‚Äôs no need to shout as no one of us are bad of hearing and apparently that was an insult to them all as they only get louder. 

In that moment my other uncle arrives and people disperse in the house and stuff gets quiet for a little. My granny goes into the garden followed by my other uncle and his oldest kid. I explain what happened to my aunt and Luca and Luca gets very quiet and leaves to look at the fish again. 

I‚Äôm not having a full on silent crying, not being able to breathe meltdown on the couch while I try and calm down as the adrenaline leaves my body. 

While they all sit down to have coffee and cake like 10 minutes later as if nothing has happened, I leave the house and take my dog for a walk and don‚Äôt return until after they are gone. 


I‚Äôm seriously debating to just cut contact with them all. This happens everytime and I won‚Äôt be talked down to like this anymore. What‚Äôs even more annoying is all the help and extra stuff my mum and I have done for my granny. She‚Äôs broken her arm and her leg in the past 6 months and we got her rehabilation, a in-house nurse and a stair lift thingy so she can move freely around the house. My mum has her guardianship and handels everything in her life, like appointments, finances, bills, etc. whenever I am here I do most of the cleaning and cooking and entertaining for my granny and all either of us gets is her bad mood and her bad-mouthing us and complaining about everything we do, while neither of my uncles nor their families do anything for her. My cousins only come for food and money and aren‚Äôt even grateful for her, but she is constantly defending Kevin and his family.

I know old people rarely change their mind but everytime I‚Äôm here I can feel my mental health deteriorating especially because both of my parents have resigned. I know it‚Äôs not worth it but I don‚Äôt like when people treat others like shit even if it‚Äôs my own family and I will stand up for that, as no one really stood up for me as a kid. 
I don‚Äôt understand why my granny sees them as literally holy and as if they can‚Äôt do anything wrong when my parents and I are the ones doing everything for her.  

So ye that‚Äôs about it. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore and honestly just feel like cutting them all off as that would be better for me. Im worried my granny won‚Äôt understand, as whenever you say something to her and she doesn‚Äôt agree with it she gets mad and won‚Äôt talk to you until you change your mind as only her opinion matter (typical old person ig). But sadly this does happen every single time when im here. There‚Äôs multiple small things during the day when im doing something wrong in her opinion (which I couldn‚Äôt care less about I just nod and smile), but the bad mouthing and Kevin‚Äôs family is quite literally killing me. 

Any advice is appreciated and please ask if you have questions. It‚Äôs currently 2.25am and English isn‚Äôt my first language, so I might have made some mistakes :) 
P.S. My friends said I should sell my family story to Netflix to make a soap opera bc it‚Äôs that bad lol. ",1,1735176551.0,WhatShouldIDo,1,0.99,False

We were really close and had a lot of fun times together. I never really asked her for much help depression wise. I‚Äôd occasionally share about tough things I was going through and she was helpful in those moments. 

A few months ago she told me she needed space but wouldn‚Äôt say why. I was starting to go into a really bad place mentally due to a new boss/work stressors, ptsd relapse, and treatment resistant depression that wasn‚Äôt being treated properly by my psychiatrists. 

I tried multiple times to figure out what was the problem, but she wouldn‚Äôt answer unless I met with her for coffee. (she lives rather far from me)I tried to explain to her that I was really in a tough spot mentally and she kinda just blew me off.

This situation made me feel much worse. I was really torn up by her sudden changes. We tried to meet a month ago but I ended up mixing up the dates (my new meds are messing with my memory). I bought her a gift to apologize and sent another explanation but didn‚Äôt hear back until a week ago and she wanted to fix things.

I was n board with that until my other friend told me that this person said she felt undervalued because I didn‚Äôt do anything for her recent masters program admissions and that I was leaning too much on her.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is crucial for overall health. The question many people ask is, ‚ÄúHow much water should I drink every day?‚Äù The answer can vary based on different factors, including age, gender, activity level, and climate. However, a good general rule is to aim for about 8 glasses, or 2 liters, of water daily. Let‚Äôs explore why this is important.

### 1. Maintains Fluid Balance

Your body is made up of about 60% water. This water is vital for various bodily functions, such as digestion, circulation, transportation of nutrients, and temperature regulation. Keeping hydrated helps maintain this fluid balance.

### 2. Boosts Energy Levels

Feeling tired? Dehydration can cause fatigue and lead to a drop in energy levels. When you drink enough water, you help your body function more efficiently, which can keep you energized throughout the day.

### 3. Improves Physical Performance

If you exercise regularly, hydration becomes even more essential. Water helps to keep your joints lubricated, maintain your body temperature, and transport nutrients. Staying well hydrated can enhance your physical performance and reduce the risk of injury during workouts.

### 4. Enhances Brain Function

Your brain relies on proper hydration to operate optimally. Studies show that even mild dehydration can affect concentration, increase fatigue, and impair memory. Drinking enough water can help improve your focus and mental clarity.

### 5. Aids Weight Management

- Replacing sugary drinks with water can significantly reduce calorie intake.
- Drinking water before meals can help you feel fuller, leading to lower overall food consumption.
- Water has zero calories, making it an ideal choice for those watching their weight.

### 6. Supports Digestion

Proper hydration supports digestive health. Drinking enough water helps break down food so your body can absorb nutrients. It also prevents constipation by softening stools, making bowel movements easier.

### 7. Regulates Body Temperature

Your body regulates temperature through sweating, which relies heavily on hydration. Without enough water, your body can struggle to cool down, particularly during hot weather or intense physical activity.

### 8. Promotes Healthy Skin

Drinking adequate amounts of water can improve your skin's appearance. Hydrated skin appears more supple and vibrant, while dehydration can lead to dryness and wrinkles. Plus, good hydration helps flush out toxins, contributing to clearer skin.

### 9. Strengthens Immune Function

When you're well-hydrated, your immune system functions better. Water aids in the transport of nutrients to cells and supports the removal of toxins that can hinder your immune response. Drinking enough water can help your body fight off illnesses.

### 10. Prevents Dehydration

Dehydration can lead to various health problems like kidney stones, urinary tract infections, and heat-related illnesses. By consuming enough water daily, you can significantly reduce your risk of these harmful conditions.

Now that you know the benefits of drinking water daily, consider how you can integrate more fluids into your routine. Start by carrying a reusable water bottle, setting reminders on your phone, or tracking your water intake through apps. Progressively challenge yourself to increase your daily consumption, and remember to listen to your body. Whether you‚Äôre at work, exercising, or relaxing at home, staying hydrated will lead to a healthier, more energetic lifestyle.

Common Signs of Dehydration You Should Never Ignore
---------------------------------------------------

Knowing the signs of dehydration is crucial for maintaining your health. When the body loses more fluids than it takes in, dehydration can set in quickly. It‚Äôs essential to recognize the common symptoms that suggest your body needs more water to function properly. Here are some key signs to keep an eye on.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Thirst and Dry Mouth

One of the first indicators of dehydration is feeling thirsty. When your body requires more fluid, it sends signals to your brain, urging you to drink. A dry or sticky feeling in your mouth can also signify that your body is low on water. Pay attention to these signals, and make it a habit to stay hydrated throughout the day.

### Dark Yellow Urine

Your urine can reveal a lot about your hydration levels. If you notice that your urine is dark yellow, this could be a sign that you are not drinking enough water. Clear or light yellow urine typically indicates proper hydration. Aim for a healthy balance by consuming enough fluids if you observe darker urine.

### Fatigue and Dizziness

Feeling unusually tired or dizzy can be linked to dehydration. When your body lacks enough fluids, it can lead to lowered energy levels. If you find yourself feeling fatigued after minimal activity or experience bouts of dizziness, it‚Äôs crucial to rehydrate. Drink water or eat foods with high water content to help combat these symptoms.

### Dry Skin

Your skin can also show signs of dehydration. If you notice that your skin feels dry, less elastic, or appears flaky, it might be time to drink more water. Proper hydration is essential for maintaining healthy skin. Remember, your body needs water to remain radiant and youthful.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Headaches

Headaches can frequently occur due to dehydration. When you're not consuming enough water, your brain temporarily contracts, leading to discomfort. If you experience frequent headaches, keep track of your water intake. Drinking water, herbal teas, or hydrating foods may help alleviate headache symptoms.

### Rapid Heartbeat

A rapid or increased heartbeat can be a sign that your body is dehydrated. When fluid levels drop, your heart works harder to transport blood throughout the body. This can manifest as an increased heart rate. If you notice this alongside other symptoms mentioned, be proactive and hydrate immediately.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Constipation

Dehydration often affects your digestive system, leading to constipation. When you‚Äôre not drinking enough water, your body absorbs more moisture from the food in your intestines, creating hard stools. To prevent constipation, be sure to drink sufficient fluids regularly and include fiber-rich foods in your diet.

### Cramps

Muscle cramps can also be linked to insufficient hydration. When your body loses too much water, it can cause your muscles to tighten involuntarily. If you experience cramps, especially during exercise or physical activity, it‚Äôs a sign that you may need to drink more fluids.

### Confusion or Irritability

In severe cases of dehydration, your cognitive ability can be affected. Confusion, irritability, or trouble concentrating may arise when your water levels are low. Staying hydrated is vital for brain function and overall mental clarity. If you feel off, check your water intake before anything else.


Being aware of these signs is key to preventing dehydration. It‚Äôs easier than you might think to stay hydrated. Make it a habit to carry a water bottle with you, sip regularly, and consume hydrating foods like fruits and vegetables. Your body will thank you, and you‚Äôll feel better overall!

The Role of Water in Weight Management and Metabolism
-----------------------------------------------------

Water is one of the most essential components of our bodies, playing a crucial role in overall health. Its importance becomes particularly evident when considering weight management and metabolism. Having an adequate daily intake of water can profoundly influence your weight loss journey and how efficiently your body metabolizes food. Let's explore why drinking enough water is vital for maintaining a healthy weight and enhancing your body‚Äôs metabolism.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Boosting Metabolism

Drinking water can temporarily boost your metabolic rate. Studies have shown that drinking about 500 milliliters of water can increase metabolism by approximately 30% for about 30-40 minutes. This increase in energy expenditure is thought to result from the body needing to work harder to heat the ingested water to body temperature. Therefore, by making a habit of drinking more water, you can potentially increase the number of calories you burn throughout the day.

### Caloric Reduction

One of the simplest strategies for weight management is substituting sugary drinks with water. Sugar-laden beverages like sodas contain empty calories that contribute significantly to weight gain. By replacing these high-calorie drinks with water, you can significantly cut down your calorie intake without feeling deprived. Here‚Äôs how this strategy works:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Opt for water instead of soda, juice, or energy drinks.
- Flavor your water with fruits, herbs, or spices, if desired.
- Keep a water bottle handy to remind yourself to drink more throughout the day.

### Aiding Digestion

Water plays a pivotal role in digestion, helping break down food so your body can absorb the nutrients effectively. A well-hydrated body maintains proper gastrointestinal function, which is crucial for managing one‚Äôs weight. Drinking adequate water aids in preventing constipation and can help in maintaining a healthy appetite. When combined with fiber, water can help create a feeling of fullness, leading to fewer cravings and a reduced likelihood of overeating.

### Regulating Hunger

Sometimes, our bodies may confuse thirst for hunger. When you feel hungry, it might be your body signaling a need for hydration instead. Drinking water can help lessen feelings of hunger and prevent unnecessary snacking. To avoid this pitfall:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Drink a glass of water before meals to curb excessive hunger.
- Monitor your hydration levels and drink water regularly to stay ahead of hunger cues.
- Keep track of how much water you consume each day.

### Increased Physical Performance

Good hydration is essential for achieving optimal physical performance. When your body is well-hydrated, you're likely to have better endurance during workouts, which can enhance weight management. Dehydration, on the other hand, can lead to fatigue and reduced exercise intensity, making it harder to stick to an exercise regimen. To ensure you are hydrated:

- Drink water before, during, and after your workouts.
- Consider sports drinks during long or intense sessions, but keep hydration as your primary focus.

### Detoxification

Water plays a critical role in flushing out toxins from the body through urine. A well-hydrated individual supports kidney function, which is essential for waste removal. When your kidneys function efficiently, your body can manage weight more effectively, preventing water retention and ensuring a smooth metabolic process. Therefore, maintaining hydration aids in supporting your body‚Äôs own detox systems.

### Promoting Healthy Skin

Another indirect benefit of drinking more water is its positive effect on skin health. Hydrated skin appears more plump and elastic, and can help reduce the appearance of fine lines. Healthy skin can boost your confidence and motivate you to maintain a healthier lifestyle, including better food choices and increased physical activity.

Understanding the role of water in weight management and metabolism can tremendously impact your health journey. From boosting your metabolism and aiding digestion to reducing calorie intake and enhancing physical performance, the benefits of proper hydration are undeniable. Make water a priority in your daily routine and witness the transformative effects it can have on your overall health and well-being.

Creative Ways to Increase Your Daily Water Intake
-------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is crucial for your overall health. However, finding ways to drink more water daily can sometimes feel like a challenge. Here are some creative strategies to help you increase your daily water intake.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Flavor it Up

If plain water doesn‚Äôt excite your taste buds, try adding natural flavors. Slice up fruits like lemon, lime, or orange to give your water a refreshing twist. You can also experiment with herbs like mint or basil for an herbal infusion. Cucumber slices add a cooling effect, making your water enjoyable and refreshing.

### Set a Reminder

In our busy lives, it‚Äôs easy to forget to drink water. Setting reminders on your phone or using apps designed to track your water intake can keep you on track. Consider scheduling water breaks every hour to remind yourself to sip throughout the day.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Use a Stylish Water Bottle

Having a visually appealing water bottle can motivate you to drink more. Choose one that‚Äôs easy to carry and fits your style. Some bottles even come with built-in fruit infusers so you can make flavored water on the go. This not only increases your intake but also adds a personal touch to your hydration routine.

### Drink Before Every Meal

A glass of water before each meal can significantly boost your daily intake. Try drinking at least one glass of water before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Not only will this help you stay hydrated, but it can also aid in digestion and control hunger.

### Make it a Game

Turn drinking water into a fun challenge. Set daily goals, and track your progress. Use stickers or a chart to mark each glass you drink. Challenge friends or family members to join you and compete to see who can drink the most water in a week. This healthy competition can motivate everyone to stay hydrated.

### Pair Water with Routine Activities

Linking your water intake to daily activities can help you remember to drink. For instance, take a sip every time you check your email or scroll through social media. By associating water breaks with routine behaviors, you‚Äôre more likely to stay consistent with your hydration goals.

### Hydrating Snacks

Water-rich foods into your diet can help maintain hydration levels. Fruits and vegetables like watermelon, cucumber, and oranges have high water content. Snacking on these foods not only fills you up but also contributes to your total daily hydration.

### Carry a Measuring Cup

Instead of just guessing how much water you‚Äôre drinking, use a measuring cup to track your intake. By knowing the volume of your servings, you can set specific goals. For example, if you aim for eight cups a day, it‚Äôs easier to plan how much you need to drink at different times.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Make it a Habit

Incorporate drinking water into your daily habits. For example, drink a glass of water immediately after brushing your teeth or while waiting for your coffee to brew. By linking water intake to established habits, you‚Äôre more likely to remember to drink. Consistency is key!

### Infuse with Tea

Herbal teas are another excellent alternative to increase hydration. They can be enjoyed hot or cold, providing a tasty way to stay hydrated. Caffeine-free herbal options are particularly beneficial if you want to avoid the dehydration effects of caffeine.

### Socialize Over Water

Invite friends or family to join you for a water-centric gathering. Make it fun by having flavored water stations where everyone can create their own unique mixes. Not only does this encourage drinking water, but it also becomes a social event that you look forward to!

By making small adjustments to your routine, you can easily increase your daily water intake. Whether you flavor it, track it, or make it fun, staying hydrated can be an enjoyable part of your daily life. Remember, your body will thank you!

Understanding the Link Between Hydration and Mental Clarity
-----------------------------------------------------------

Hydration plays a crucial role in maintaining your overall health, and its impact extends far beyond the physical aspect. Many people often overlook the connection between drinking enough water and maintaining mental clarity. Understanding this link is essential for enhancing your cognitive abilities and promoting a healthier lifestyle.

Your brain is composed of about 75% water, which underscores the importance of hydration for optimal brain function. When your body is dehydrated, it can lead to a decline in your cognitive abilities. Here are several ways in which staying hydrated can help you maintain mental clarity:

### 1. Enhances Concentration

When you drink enough water, it helps improve your ability to focus. Studies have shown that even slight dehydration can lead to difficulties concentrating on tasks. By ensuring you consume the right amount of water daily, you can keep your mind sharp and ready for any challenge.

### 2. Boosts Memory

The connection between hydration and memory is significant. Water aids in the transmission of signals in the brain, which is vital for memory retention and recall. By staying hydrated, you can enhance both your short-term and long-term memory capabilities.

### 3. Reduces Fatigue

Feeling tired can cloud your thinking and hinder your ability to make decisions. When you are dehydrated, it can create a sense of fatigue that makes it challenging to stay alert throughout the day. Consuming adequate water can keep your energy levels up and prevent mental fatigue.

### 4. Improves Mood

Your mood can greatly affect your mental clarity. Hydration levels are linked to emotional balance. Studies indicate that drinking enough water can help reduce feelings of anxiety and irritability. A well-hydrated person is more likely to maintain a positive outlook, leading to clearer thinking and better decision-making abilities.

### 6. Prevents Headaches

Dehydration is a common trigger for headaches. Headaches can severely impair your ability to think clearly and focus. By drinking enough water throughout the day, you can prevent dehydration-related headaches from interfering with your mental productivity.

### 7. Enhances Cognitive Flexibility

Being able to adapt your thinking is crucial for problem-solving and creativity. Hydration supports cognitive flexibility, allowing you to switch gears mentally when faced with new information or challenges. This adaptability is essential for maintaining clarity in your thought processes.

### 8. Regulates Body Temperature

Your brain operates best when your body is at a comfortable temperature. Dehydration can lead to an increase in body temperature, negatively affecting cognitive function. Drinking enough water helps regulate your body temperature, enabling your brain to work more effectively.

### 9. Promotes Sleep Quality

What is your take on being friends with an ex who broke up with you after a 3 year relationship? [now both 19]

We both cared really deeply for each other, started off with a flirty friendship, which the dumper initiated back then and  we decided to commit to a relationship. Three years and a break up later I can say, goddam we had a beautiful time together. Especially the non sexual parts, we‚Äôre just truly stunning. 

The last three month of the relationship were hard on the both of us. I struggled with the lack of sexual intimacy and she felt a lot of pressure on herself, which turned into unhappiness and her deciding to end the relationship, while I was still believing that we could fix our problems. It wasn‚Äôt something out of the blue, and still it was so damn emotional for the both of us when we talked about it. We were both very big on communication and transparency and had a talk two weeks after the break up, to exchange thoughts on the relationship. After that we went 5 weeks no contact, as I needed space. 

6 week post break up, we meet up for a coffee and talked about our upcoming futures and things that happened during no contact. I was really not expecting it, but I genuinely enjoyed the time and was so so happy for her when she told me that she hit her gym milestone. It is this feeling of being proud of her, which I have never felt for anyone else before. It is the feeling of wanting her to be happy and succeeding in life. It is the feeling of her still listening to my problems, responding fast to my messages and being there for me. I don‚Äôt feel the need to kiss her or anything, but rather to hug her in a friendly way. 

These things keep me wondering if we could have a good, non sexual, but still caring and (platonic love) friendship with each other? So what is your guys take on this??",1,1735176113.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

**Jeni‚Äôs Lemon Crinkle**
- A mellow, buttery, warm lemon flavour‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt have a tang if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for. I liked it! 

**Jeni‚Äôs Strawberry Buttermilk**
- Super nice‚Ä¶like a realer, subtler Pocky strawberry coating 

**Ben & Jerry‚Äôs Netflix & Chill‚Äôd (peanut butter w/ brownie and pretzel pieces)**
- It‚Äôs great! Just wish the pockets of crushed pretzel were less sparse and the peanut butter flavour of the ice cream was stronger. 

**Alec‚Äôs Matcha Chocolate Chip**
- Nice matcha taste. The chocolate pieces are chunks, not chips - larger than I‚Äôd like. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again for that price.

**Van Leeuwen‚Äôs Earl Grey**
- It‚Äôs pleasant! Haven‚Äôt had anything earl grey flavoured recently so I don‚Äôt know how it compares.

**Jeni‚Äôs Brambleberry Crisp**
- I didn‚Äôt really like the oat strudel‚Ä¶I really wish this flavour worked for me! 

**Lopez Island Creamery‚Äôs Wild Blackberry**
- Some of the best ice cream I‚Äôve ever had. Can‚Äôt put the taste into words, but it kind of reminds me of really good cake you‚Äôd get from an Asian bakery? Seriously considering making a trip to their creamery to try flavours not available in grocery stores‚Ä¶

**Tillamook‚Äôs Coffee Almond Fudge**
- It‚Äôs pleasant! Not any worse than the more expensive ice creams, I just prefer the flavour a little less.

**Alec‚Äôs Banana Chocolate Date Shake**
- Heavy on the cinnamon, to the point that it kinda masks everything else. Not complaining bc I like cinnamon a lot :) A bit icy!

1hmdm8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hmdm8u/aitah_for_bringing_starbucks_into_my_work/,AITAH for bringing Starbucks into my work?,"This all happened a while ago and there's already gonna be some updates into the story but in the moment it was genuinely weighing on my conscious if I was wrong to do so.

So I, 16F, have an uncle who owns a coffee shop and I worked for him for almost a year. He was my boss and his management skills were quite emotionally driven. He changed the whole way we brewed tea after we ran out one day, opened up new locations because he thought it would bring in more money and yet was cutting back on hours because payroll went from 60k to 90k, and he changed how we do our coffee order because someone was going downstairs and taking a 5 lb bag of beans and walking out (still don't know how no one caught onto this). My relationship to him isn't super close, he isn't my moms brother, but he's my aunts husband, never really gave more than a side hug when at family get-togethers and I cant remember us ever talking one-on-one. 

This story all starts when I bring Starbucks in to work because even though we're a coffee shop, we don't have things like refreshers or anything with lemonade. My sister and I both enjoy these drinks and due to me having a later shift, I'll bring a grande into work for her. I would change the lid and the cups, as to make sure that it had no trace of Starbucks except for maybe the color of the drink which is pink. Me and my aunt had an earlier interaction where she had shown a disdain for bringing in outside drinks into work but 1. we're not on the same level as Starbucks and 2. my uncle later told me that it was ok to bring my drinks in, as long as I placed it into one of their cups and get rid of the green straw, exactly what I always did from that point on. However, one day my aunt comes in and I had my drink in their cup but she asks, ""Is that Starbucks?"" I regrettably lie and say ""No its (herbal tea) with a couple of squeezes of lemon."" something I knew would create almost the exact color. She then goes, ""Ok, then make it for me"" and I did. My coworker, O, asks me, ""so how are you going to pull this off?"" I tell her about my plan and she sort of giggles and just leaves it at that. What I didn't know is that while I was away, steeping the tea, she tells my aunt and uncle who had arrived at that point that I said to her and another employee that ""they're so f\*\*\*\*\*g stupid, they won't even know it's Starbucks"" which is something I'd never say, especially about family. After I make the ""drink"" and them flip flopping on believing me, I get chewed out for 20 minutes about lying and how it's not ok, obviously I know this and the only reason why I did was because I freaked out and just said what I thought wasn't going to get me in trouble. I ended up crying for my entire break and pretty much all of my coworkers saw me come back with puffy eyes and sniffling. I even started breaking down later in the day when my sister asked me what happened and I told her. 

Later on, my mom texts me as I'm doing our coffee order and asks me, ""who did you say ""they're so f\*\*\*\*\*g stupid they wont even know its Starbucks"" to?"" I respond to her that I didn't, explained the whole thing, and once again I'm a mess at work, crying and hiding behind the counter so then if a customer comes in, the first thing they see isn't me sobbing. After work, I get into my stepdad's car and continue crying, I tell him about everything that happened and he's sitting there comforting me. On our ride back home I text O a screenshot of what my mom said followed up with, ""was this you?"" either if she had said I said that, or if she knew who said that. She responds with ""bro what"" I kid you not, and I just send back ""I just don't know who would say that"". 30 minutes after I send the final message, I get a text from my uncle/boss saying, ""OP, you lied to my face today. You need to take accountability for your actions and your lies. I hold you responsible only for what you did directly to me, your uncle, and your aunt. Harassment of other team members will not be tolerated. Whatever your mom and your aunt discussed with regards to your behavior is a private conversation between sisters and should not be brought up to anyone at work. I suggest you take a look inward at why you are in this position. It has nothing to do with what anyone may or may not have heard you say. It only has to do with you lying to our faces."" which is seriously ridiculous thinking that a three message conversation is harassment. I showed this message to my mom and she ended up EMAILING her sister because she wasn't wanting to text her further.

The next day, my boss texts me that I shouldn't come into work and that he'll call me to discuss how ""we can move forward after this"". I honestly knew I was done for, it was either I was gonna quit after this whole s\*\*\* show or I was getting fired. When seeing the messages between my aunt and my mom I seriously felt my heart beating in my ears. Messages about how the OTHER girl was ""so shaken up"" by my two messages to her and how she's ""so fragile"" even though 2 weekends before this she was peeing in a sink drunk at a party and had sex with her boyfriend in the work bathroom! Not so fragile if you ask me. Not only had my aunt said this, but she also said that I've ""shown how effortlessly she can lie so I wouldn't be surprised if \[my mom\] wasn't getting the full story."" which I cannot tell you how hurtful it was to read; knowing that my aunt, who I've cried in her arms when i was missing my mom on her wedding night with my stepdad, who I saw not just as my aunt but as a friend, had this evil opinion of me, again, over saying that my drink wasn't Starbucks. Not only this, but trying to put my mom against me when she's one of the only people who was fighting tooth and nail for me despite having a million other things on her plate.

Anyways I got fired a couple days after getting told not to come into work. He called me and said, ""we try and pride ourselves on being respectful of coworkers, customers, and being honest and I feel as though you haven't been delivering on two of those things."" I cannot tell you how many times I rolled my eyes during that phone call. Call me a C U Next Tuesday but this man is the biggest liar in the world to customers and it is so ironic for him to be condemning me for lying. I didn't cry, despite what my previous paragraphs would suggest I'd do and I removed O on everything. I don't even care that she might find this, there are some things I'd like to say but out of respect for my future and college applications I'm refraining. I don't know if there's anything else to say. If someone mentions a plot hole due to me forgetting to mention a detail I'll respond but for now, I'm curious as to if this was a bad thing for me to do. Would you handle this differently? Was it wrong for me to bring it in despite being told previously it was ok? Thank you for all responses and suggestions!!",3,1735175946.0,AITAH,0,0.8,False

This is going to be a pretty long text so bare with me if my story telling isn't continious, English isn't my first language :)

My father (50) cheated on my mom (50) after 30 years of marriage with his 38 year old barber, who has two children. He's been in my life for 20 years. Now, our family has broken apart and my mom and 16 year old sister are moving out in the upcoming weekend.

My dad has always been a VERY religious man. We attended a lot of ""church meetings"" for as long as I can remember. He has (could now say ""had"") always had good morals and he's raised me to be a good man, at least in my opinion. A month ago, he left the religious congregation. He says he left, because he doesn't agree with how things are handled there and how other people teach and understand the Bible wrongly. This made sense for me until I was told by my mom that he's been seing this woman since summer and summer was the time he started talking about leaving almost every day. He won't admit it, but I believe he's deceived us all into believing that he left because of the reasons I mentioned above.

He grew up in a very toxic household. His father was a drunk who beat his mom and cheated on her on a daily basis. He despises his father to the maximum extent, but does the same thing (except for drinking and beating her) AFTER 30 YEARS OF MARRIAGE. My mom has given EVERYTHING to him: her money, love, time, health and that's how this greatous religious man repays her.

 Funny thing is, he doesn't even seem to understand what he's doing. It's like he's a suddenly a completely different person. That is not my dad, at least not the dad I've lived my whole life with. He acts if everything's normal. He first told about his affair to his mom and sister. He even asked his sister if it was fine if he came to have coffee sometimes with this new ""girlfriend"". My grandmom and aunt disowned him and he had no one left except for me, my girlfriend, my mom, my sister and a few friends. Now, he doesn't even have that. I can't believe it, what is he thinking? Why is he doing that? What made the man I knew become an exact opposite of his beliefs in a matter of 6 months? Why? Just, why?

My mom and dad had many talks about this over the past week and all my dad could say was: ""I can't do anything about it, it's how I feel. I can't fight my feelings. Would you like a man who's physically there, but mentally not?"". It's just f-in insane. He ""won't sell the house"" and asked my mom to leave today. He doesn't work 6 months of the year, these 6 months, they live off my mom's paychecks. How will he be able to afford food, animal food, electricity, bills, loans and all the chores around the house ALONE? I just can't come to understand what the f is he thinking? I am certain that gold digger of a woman will leave him in some time and he will be alone. He will have nothing but memories of a seemingly happy family. I don't know if anyone would ever forgive him but he will be completely alone if that woman leaves him. I think he's setting up his life for an ultimate failure and I'm scared of what the future holds for him, because he can't see past this.

He hasn't talked to me since I got told about this fiasco. It's fine though, I live on my own and it doesn't affect me as much. But, he hasn't talked to my sister either who lives with them. Not a single word, my sister's birthday was ruined because of his actions. He didn't even properly wish happy birthday to her, it was a cold and dead ""Happy birthday"". From what I've heard from my mom, he doesn't believe he has to tell us about this situation, but that WE have to go to him to talk about it. WHAT? How big of a coward can you be? I think there's something seriously wrong with him, like a health issue that affects his brain maybe? Because this is just unreal and a shock to all of us.

I still love and painfully miss my ""old dad"" but this, whatever he has become now, is dead to me. It hurts me so, so much. I feel betrayed and lost. How will I come to terms with my father never being in my life again after 20 years?

I started off at Union Square, enjoyed the holiday vibes with the Christmas tree, ice rink, and Macy‚Äôs festive decorations. From there, I hopped on a cable car and rode all the way to Buena Vista for the Irish coffee. Pro tip, it was not crowded on Christmas Eve.

After that, I took a stroll along the waterfront and caught a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Next, I walked uphill to the Fairmont Hotel to see their famous Christmas decorations. The walk took me past beautiful homes and breathtaking views of the city, like the Coit Tower and the Bay Bridge.

To wrap up the night, I went to Grace Cathedral for their midnight mass. While I‚Äôm not religious, I wanted to experience the tradition. It was a long program, and the cathedral was quite cold inside, so I‚Äôd recommend brining layers. Also a lot of people showed up so good to arrive early to secure a central seat.

I wasn‚Äôt scared my family didn‚Äôt love me anymore.¬† I was scared because, no matter what happened ten years ago, they *did* love me.¬† They loved me unconditionally.

And loving me was the most dangerous thing anyone could do.

‚ÄúRynne, do you need to talk?‚Äù Amber asked.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love an excuse to blow off my next class.‚Äù

My eyes fell on Noura, standing by the door. ¬†

*I‚Äôm not done yet.*

‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you later,‚Äù I said to Amber.¬† ‚ÄúI promise.‚Äù

I hung up and ran to Noura. ¬†

‚ÄúOne more time.‚Äù

Noura scrunched up her face.¬† ‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre up for one more time?¬† You look like you saw a ghost.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes!¬† Yes.¬† Please.‚Äù

*One more time.*

One more chance to save them all.

\*\*\*\*\*

‚ÄúYep, Moran‚Äôs taking her to prom.¬† It was either Mads or his cousin.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, shut it, Ansler.¬† Even your cousin wouldn‚Äôt go to prom with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?¬† Sabrina‚Äôs, like, 100% down to be my date.""

‚ÄúI thought you guys were in a not-hooking-up phase.‚Äù

High school.¬† The table under the oak tree, by the quad.¬† Lunchtime with Madison, Ryan, and Chase.

‚ÄúWe should have a pre-party at your place, Chase.¬† You, Sabrina, me, Ryan, Rynne, Peter, and that bottle of vodka that‚Äôs been in my parents‚Äô freezer forever.‚Äù

I stared at Madison, my beautiful best friend, waves of love radiating through my chest.¬† She loved me, too.¬† In order to save her, I‚Äôd soon have to hurt her.¬† Abandon her forever.

‚ÄúMaddie, you‚Äôre fucking amazing,‚Äù I said suddenly.¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my favorite person.¬† You played like a badass on Sunday.¬† Watching you steal bases is, like, magical.¬† And you should wear yellow to prom.¬† You look so hot in yellow.‚Äù

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ you okay, babe?‚Äù Madison asked, confused.¬† Confused, but smiling.

I looked back and forth between the two boys.¬† They deserved some 27-year-old wisdom as well.

‚ÄúChase, Sabrina‚Äôs really into you,‚Äù I said.¬† ‚ÄúI know she‚Äôs got the whole tough-chick, I-don‚Äôt-need-anyone thing going on, but she loves you.¬† And‚Ä¶ and she‚Äôs going to go away to Yale soon, and I think you‚Äôll really regret it if you screw things up with her.‚Äù

Chase looked like he‚Äôd eaten a lemon.¬† ‚ÄúThanks, Oliveri?¬† I think?‚Äù

My phone buzzed in my pocket.¬† I ignored it, and turned to Ryan.

‚ÄúPeter really appreciates you, man.¬† He‚Äôs not gonna say it, but he‚Äôs so grateful you‚Äôve always got his back.‚Äù¬† My heart beat faster, but I couldn‚Äôt stop.¬† ‚ÄúWhen you see Peter, tell him he‚Äôs been a great friend.¬† One day, he‚Äôs going to meet a girl who deserves him.¬† And I‚Äôm so sorry that girl isn‚Äôt me.‚Äù

My phone buzzed again.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to go, guys.‚Äù

I left them there.¬† I sent my response to Brent.¬† I scampered to the science lab to meet him.

I had to save Brent.¬† I had to save my classmates, and my friends, and my family.¬† I‚Äôd stay with him.¬† I‚Äôd convince him to go to therapy.¬† I‚Äôd love him forever, unconditionally.

And I knew what I'd be forced to give up.

\*\*\*\*\*

On April 7th, 2024, at 6:45 AM, I woke in my mildew-stained bedroom in my suburban Pennsylvania duplex, shivering.¬† Outside, snow fell in torrents.¬† Someone tugged my leg.

‚ÄúMommy, I‚Äôm cold.¬† Can I climb into bed with you?‚Äù ¬†

I nodded and lifted the blankets.¬† Mia, my six-year-old daughter, crawled in and snuggled up against me, her cold little hands on my arms.¬† I hugged her tightly, wrapping myself around her like a mother cat, breathing in the smell of her soft blonde hair.¬† She‚Äôd inherited my heart-shaped face and Brent‚Äôs beautiful blue eyes. ¬†

‚ÄúMommy, where‚Äôs Daddy?‚Äù Mia murmured.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, muffin.¬† Probably downstairs in his office.‚Äù

‚ÄòOffice‚Äô was a euphemism for Brent‚Äôs man-cave in our basement, where he‚Äôd been, in theory, designing a RPG; in actuality, playing Call of Duty online until four in the morning.¬†

‚ÄúMommy, can I go back to gymnastics?¬† I miss my team.‚Äù

I stroked Mia‚Äôs hair, ran my fingers down her pudgy little arm. ¬†

‚ÄúI know, baby,‚Äù I muttered.¬† ‚ÄúBut Mommy can‚Äôt pay the mortgage and the gym fees.¬† Just be patient.¬† Daddy will get a new job really, really soon.‚Äù

*It‚Äôs been two years since he got canned from the last one*, I thought.¬† *But keep on hoping, buttercup*. ¬†

BUZZ!¬† BUZZ!¬† My alarm blared.¬† 7:00am.

I threw off the covers and nudged Mia.

‚ÄúCome on, baby.¬† Let‚Äôs get ready for school.‚Äù

\*\*\*\*\*

While Mia dressed, I tiptoed downstairs, across the living room, and to the door that lead to the basement.¬† My breath fogged.¬† I cursed myself, again, for leaving Los Angeles for the icy northeast. ¬†

It had been my idea.¬† Seven years ago, when Brent was fresh out of college and I was pregnant with Mia, I‚Äôd convinced him to take the job he‚Äôd been offered with a software firm in Pittsburgh.¬† To take me away, far away from our respective families, both of whom disapproved of our marriage.¬† Away from everyone we‚Äôd known in high school.¬† Somewhere we could start fresh, start our own family, create a life for ourselves.

That job only lasted six months, before Brent was abruptly fired for sending threatening e-mails to a female co-worker.¬† Then there was the IT gig at the hospital, then the university, then the video game developer that went bankrupt.¬† I was supposed to go back to school.¬† But there was never enough money. ¬†

I opened the door to the stairs that lead to the basement.¬† The stench of mildew and rotting food watered my eyes.¬† I wasn‚Äôt allowed in Brent‚Äôs office.¬† I made it a point to sneak down once a week or so, to clean out the old pizza boxes. ¬†

‚ÄúHey, babe,‚Äù I called down.¬† ‚ÄúYou there?‚Äù

I took a couple steps.¬† I saw Brent hunched in his computer chair, curly brown-haired head buried in his arms, fast asleep with his headset on.

‚ÄúBabe?‚Äù I repeated, louder.

With a snort, Brent snapped awake.¬† He stared up at me with bleary, bloodshot eyes.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fucking Antarctica in here, Rynne,‚Äù he mumbled.¬† ‚ÄúCan you turn on the fucking heat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre delinquent on the gas bill, babe,‚Äù I said.¬† ‚ÄúBundle up for now.¬† I‚Äôll pay the bill with my tips tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù¬† Brent pulled himself to his feet, tugged off his headset, and ambled up the stairs.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go to bed.‚Äù

I nodded.¬† I pretended he‚Äôd been working on his RPG all night. ¬†I really wished he‚Äôd go to therapy, work through his self-esteem issues.¬† I‚Äôd brought it up so many times.¬† Researched online, gotten recommendations for good psychologists.¬† I promised to pay for it.¬† But Brent refused.¬† He insisted therapy was for cucks.

After Brent went upstairs to our bedroom, I put on the coffee and made Eggo waffles for Mia.¬† Then, we bundled up in boots and thermal jackets and walked to the bus stop, Mia stopping every few feet to jump in fresh patches of snow.¬† As the school bus pulled up, she threw her arms around me.¬† I kissed the top of her head, tugged a blonde pigtail. ¬†

‚ÄúI love you, Mommy!‚Äù

‚ÄúLove you to pieces, Muffin.¬† Have a good day at school.‚Äù

As she skipped up the steps, I was seized with a surge of love so powerful it nearly knocked me down. ¬†

Mia was worth all of it.¬† She was worth the whole world.

\*\*\*\*\*

Brent was still asleep when I returned to our duplex.¬† I ventured into the basement with gloves and trash bags, collected the moldy dishes and take-out containers, wiped Brent‚Äôs desk and vacuumed the floor.¬† Then, I straightened Mia‚Äôs room and gathered the laundry.¬† Our dryer had been broken for months, so I drove the clothes to the laundromat on Main Street.¬† I shopped at the grocery store, then retrieved the clothes, went back home, unpacked, and folded.

1:30pm.¬† Another hour and a half before I had to pick Mia up from the bus stop; four hours until my shift began at The Blue Squirrel, the college dive where I bartended.

I pulled out my eight-year-old laptop, remembered happily that I had paid the phone bill, and logged onto Facebook.¬† I had 26 friends.¬† Not *real* friends.¬† They were work buddies, moms of Mia‚Äôs classmates.¬† As a rule, I don‚Äôt make friends.¬† Friendship requires honesty and vulnerability and, eventually, it would require the revelation that I‚Äôve been lonely as long as I can remember.

I hovered my cursor over the Search bar.

Fuck it.

I typed: Amber Oliveri.

My sister‚Äôs page popped up immediately.¬† I scrolled through her jokes about Constitutional Law and the Northwestern cafeteria; the many pictures of her laughing, arms around her law school friends. ¬†

I eyed the ‚ÄúFriend‚Äù button.¬† Then I came to my senses.¬† I recalled the long chain of Facebook messages from Amber.¬† The pleas to take Mia and come home to California, which I‚Äôd read but never answered.¬† It had been nine months.¬† Amber didn‚Äôt want to hear from me, now.

I went back to the Search bar, typed Jenica Oliveri.

Creeping on my youngest sister‚Äôs page, I couldn‚Äôt help but smile.¬† She was full of precious, nineteen-year-old observations about the world.¬† Her UC Irvine dorm room looked adorable.¬† It made me happy, knowing she was having the sort of freshman year I‚Äôd dreamed about. ¬†

But I couldn‚Äôt friend her, either.¬† I hadn‚Äôt spoken to Jenica since the last time I was home, and that was five years ago.¬† She‚Äôd been fourteen.¬† I couldn‚Äôt show up back in her life, out of the blue, and dampen her youthful joy with my bullshit.

I looked for Hunter, next.¬† Her profile broke my heart.¬† Wedding pictures, honeymoon pictures, her and James cuddling on a beach in Cancun.¬† My mother had texted me to let me know Hunter was getting married.¬† But I hadn‚Äôt been invited, so I hadn‚Äôt given it another thought.¬† I mean, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd been expecting an invitation.¬† The last time Hunter and I saw each other, Brent had assaulted James at the beach, insisting he was ‚Äúleering at me.‚Äù

Something boiled inside me.¬† I felt brave, daring, hungry for a jolt of adrenalin.¬† I‚Äôd considered Facebook-stalking friends and acquaintances from Grey Street High many times, but I‚Äôd never had the guts.¬† I‚Äôd been afraid, concerned that even my brief digital presence would somehow destroy my old classmates, like my texts to Brent had destroyed their lives a decade before.¬† But in this world, this ephemeral dream world, *this world that would disappear as soon as I was disconnected from the VR game‚Ä¶*

I typed ‚ÄúGrey Street High School Class of 2014‚Äù into the search bar.

The page was there.¬† And yes, it was the right Grey Street High School.

I clicked on it.¬† 206 members. ¬†

I scrolled down the list, peering at the familiar but aged faces, until I found one that was unmistakeable.

Madison.¬† She went by Madison Brenner, now.

Madison lived in Boston.¬† She was a nurse, married to another nurse, with a toddler son and - by the looks of it - another one on the way.¬† In her profile, she eye-smiled through a N-95 mask and face shield in front of the vaccination clinic she‚Äôd run back in 2021.¬† She posted picture after picture of her beautiful family, her giggling friends, her gorgeous house.

I missed Madison.¬† I missed her so much.¬† But, what could I do?¬† Reach out to her, ten years on, and tell her I was still married to that guy she couldn‚Äôt stand?

I resumed scrolling.¬† I scrolled down until I saw him.

Peter.

Something fluttered in my stomach - perhaps the ghosts of teen-aged hormones long since reabsorbed.¬† I clicked on his profile.¬† I laughed.

Peter definitely wasn‚Äôt the high school dreamboat who lived in my imagination.¬† He‚Äôd put on some weight since his baseball days, and his hairline was receding.¬† But his goofy, open-mouthed smile was as endearing as ever.¬† He‚Äôd gone to school for accounting and passed the CPA exam; he worked for PwC in Los Angeles.¬† He hadn‚Äôt let go of his dreams entirely, though - there were plenty of pictures of him performing stand-up in cute little LA clubs.¬† And he was engaged to Vicky Hsu, another CPA he‚Äôd met in college. ¬†

I blinked back tears.¬† *Good for you, Peter.* ¬†

Then, I followed one more wild impulse.

I sent Peter a message. ¬†

*Hey!¬† Remember me?¬† Rynne, from high school.¬† I just came across your page, and I wanted to say hi.¬† And congratulations on the engagement!*

I smiled. ¬†

I heard footsteps down the stairs.

I closed out of Facebook just as Brent emerged into the kitchen.

‚ÄúDo we have any food, Babe?‚Äù he asked.

*He‚Äôs my man,* I thought.¬† *I love Brent.¬† I saved Brent.*

I nodded.¬† ‚ÄúYeah, I just went shopping.¬† I got some of that Italian ham you like.‚Äù

With a grunt, Brent opened the fridge.

‚ÄúHey Babe,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúif I make good tips, what do you say we drive into Pittsburgh on Saturday?¬† Take Mia to the museum, or the botanical gardens?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can take the car,‚Äù Brent replied, spreading mayo on wheat bread.¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was thinking we all go together.¬† Like, as a family.‚Äù

‚ÄúMmm,‚Äù Brent mumbled.¬† ‚ÄúSure.¬† If it‚Äôll make you happy.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt really, really will.‚Äù

Brent gave me a half-smile as he collected his sandwich and retreated to the basement.¬† I might have imagined it, but I saw a glimmer of light in his pretty blue eyes.

*I did it, Baby.¬† I saved them all.*

\*\*\*\*\*

At three, I met Mia at the bus stop, pink-cheeked and giggling.¬† I fixed her chicken and noodles for dinner, helped her with her math homework, then went upstairs to change for work.

I ignored the bruises on my chest and arms as I pulled my low-cut uniform shirt over my head.

Though it had gotten colder in the house, a fire burned inside me that couldn‚Äôt be vanquished.¬† My life wasn‚Äôt perfect, sure.¬† Money was tight.¬† Brent could be moody, and I really wished he‚Äôd take his mental health more seriously.¬† But I had a family I loved, a home of my own.¬† I‚Äôd saved Brent.¬† I‚Äôd saved everyone.¬† And Mia was my reward from the universe.

That fire burned right through my shift at The Blue Squirrel.¬† The typical weekday night problem customers showed up: 95-pound girls who drank their Long Island Ice Tea too fast; frat boys keeling over after 9 shots of Patron.¬† But there was also a cadre of quirky theater students who quoted Monty Python with me all night, then a group from the Physician Assistant school and their professors, who sipped martinis and tipped 25%. ¬†

I clocked out, finally, at 4:00am.¬† $250 in tips - enough for both the gas bill and a day trip to Pittsburgh.¬† A few more nights like this, and I could pay for Mia‚Äôs gymnastics lessons.

As I opened and closed my front door behind me, I noticed the light was on in the living room. ¬†

A figure sat, motionless, on our threadbare sofa. ¬†

I stopped in my tracks.¬† I gasped.

Brent.¬† His hunting rifle in his lap.

‚ÄúBabe, what‚Ä¶‚Äù I started.

Brent knocked something to the ground, so forcefully I yelped.¬† My laptop.

‚ÄúI KNEW it!‚Äù Brent growled.¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking to that fuckboy from high school.¬† The one you cheated on me with!‚Äù

Icy tendrils worked their way down my spine.¬† ‚ÄúBaby, I never cheated on you.¬† And‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt FUCKING LIE!‚Äù Brent screamed, jumping to his feet.¬† ‚ÄúI fucking saw your browsing history.¬† Maybe next time, if you‚Äôre going to be a whore, sign out of Facebook.‚Äù

Panic burning, my heart beat faster.¬† *Fucking idiot.¬† Fucking stupid idiot.*

‚ÄúBrent, I‚Ä¶‚Äù I stammered, keeping my voice calm.¬† ‚ÄúI was just feeling nostalgic.¬† It doesn‚Äôt mean anything.¬† Plus, he lives two thousand miles away.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre going to LEAVE ME?‚Äù¬† Chest puffed, shoulders squared.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I reassured him, laughing a little.¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be ridiculous.¬† I love you, Brent.¬† I married you.¬† I saved you.‚Äù

Brent laughed humorlessly.¬† Gun in one hand, he took a step towards me, looming.

‚ÄúYou saved ME?¬† I fucking saved you from a life of being a slut.¬† Without me, you‚Äôd‚Äôve gotten knocked up by some beaner rapist then fucking leeched off welfare while giving blow jobs in truck stop bathrooms.¬† And THIS is the thanks I get?‚Äù

SLAM!¬† Pain.¬† Familiar pain, grey haze, ringing in my ears. ¬†

I cowered on the ground.¬† Brent stared down at me, his boyishly round face twisted, tears forming rivulets from his big blue eyes.

‚ÄúI loved you, Rynne,‚Äù he murmured.

He cocked the gun.

Then, everything happened in a blur. ¬†

Footsteps on the stairs.¬† ‚ÄúDaddy, NO!‚Äù¬† Mia.¬† Mia, in her pink unicorn pajamas, blonde hair tangled. ¬†

‚ÄúMia, RUN!‚Äù I screamed.¬† I rolled over.¬† 

But Mia ran past me.¬† She leapt at her father, thudded against him.¬† He stumbled.¬† I reached for Mia.¬† I couldn‚Äôt reach her.¬† He fumbled with the gun. ¬†

BANG!

And then, there was nothing but her beautiful blue eyes. ¬†

Her father‚Äôs eyes, frozen in terror.¬† The light draining from those eyes, a red stain stretching across her pink unicorn pajamas.

She fell.¬† She collapsed as though she were made of paper. ¬†

CRASH! ¬†

Our cheap glass table.¬† Mia crashed through it and lay, in a pile of broken glass, like a rag doll.

The world stopped.

I lunged for her.¬† I picked her up in my arms, cradled her small form to my chest.¬† She was still warm.¬† I lay her on the sofa.¬† I screamed her name.¬† Her neck hung at an unnatural angle.¬† She wasn‚Äôt breathing. ¬†

No.¬† *No, no, no, no, no.*

*My precious baby.¬† My beautiful baby.*

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all your fucking fault!‚Äù

I turned.¬† I stared into the tear-stained eyes of my husband.¬† My Brent.¬† The inky blackness gathered.

His gun was on the ground.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fucking WHORE, Rynne!¬† You killed our daughter!¬† You killed her by being a fucking worthless slut!‚Äù

I was numb.¬† I had nothing left but instinctual, primal anger.

I reached for the broken glass.¬† I took hold of the biggest piece.¬† I dove, launching myself at Brent, my arm angled back.¬† And I stabbed him straight through the neck.

He toddled.¬† He gurgled.¬† He clutched at the glass dagger, tugged it out.¬† Hot blood sprayed.

And then, I got it.¬† I finally understood.

I didn‚Äôt save Brent, because I *couldn‚Äôt* save Brent.¬† His violence had nothing to do with me.¬† It didn‚Äôt matter what I‚Äôd texted him, or whether or not I went to the fucking prom with him, or his crush, or my implied bitchiness.¬† I‚Äôd been a prop.¬† A scapegoat he could blame for his insecurity and his mental illness and his massive ego.¬† I couldn‚Äôt save him, because *he had absolutely zero desire to be saved*. ¬†

THUD!¬† Brent collapsed to the ground.

And my world collapsed into static.

\*\*\*\*\*

The white room materialized.¬† I pulled the goggles and helmet off my head.¬† I felt tears in my eyes; this time, I let them fall, as a door opened and Noura stepped out of her closet. ¬†

‚ÄúI won, didn‚Äôt I?‚Äù I asked her.

Noura smiled.¬† ‚ÄúYep, you won.¬† You will go down in history as the first person to conquer MindWars.¬† And you did it fast, too!‚Äù

I hugged her.¬† ‚ÄúThis game‚Äôs amazing.¬† You‚Äôre brilliant.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, dude, I don‚Äôt want to kick you out,‚Äù Noura said apologetically, ‚Äúbut my partners are on the way, and you‚Äôre kinda-sorta not supposed to be here‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs totally cool,‚Äù I reassured her.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been playing for, like, days.‚Äù

Noura gave me a weird look.¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about, Rynne?¬† You just got here.‚Äù

I pulled my cell phone out of my purse.¬† I checked the time.¬† She was right.

Twelve minutes had passed.

\*\*\*\*\*

First, I emptied that bottle of Vanilla Stoli down the drain.

Then, I called Amber back, then my parents, then Hunter, and then I texted Jenica.

After that, I made an account on every social networking site.¬† My graduating class did actually have a Facebook page; I scrolled through it, added Madison and Peter as friends, and messaged them both.

They responded within hours.¬† Versions of, ‚Äúwow, so great to hear from you, I thought you were dead!‚Äù¬† Condensed accounts of the last decade of their lives. ¬†

And, from Madison, this:

*I don‚Äôt know if you need to hear this, Rynne, but absolutely NO ONE blamed you for what Brent did.¬† Well, maybe a couple pick-me girls on the internet and MRA pussies, but no one who actually knew anything about anything.¬† Brent was just a violent bastard.¬† Remember that St. Agnes swimmer chick he dated sophomore year?¬† Katie something?¬† Yeah, she made three different police reports, the last one because he threatened her with a gun.*

I hadn‚Äôt known that.

Next, I Google‚Äôd local colleges.¬† Writing courses.¬† Programs for older adult students.

But screw it.

See, I made this story all about me.¬† Me, and Brent, and my delusions.¬† But it really shouldn‚Äôt have been about either of us.¬† The story should‚Äôve been about the nine people Brent took down with him.

Michelle Garcia, 17 years old.¬† She was a big girl, six foot two in socks, but a total girly girl.¬† She planned on graduating from Oregon State, where she‚Äôd been awarded a basketball scholarship, then attending fashion school and designing her own clothing line, specifically for tall women.

Hayden King, only 14, the youngest victim.¬† The only freshman on the varsity basketball team; little, but fast.¬† She loved animals more than anything in the world, volunteered at a shelter, and dreamed of being a veterinarian one day.

Heather Bardsnell, 36.¬† The cool, pretty young coach the entire student body adored.¬† Her office door was always open, for whatever juvenile concern we wanted to discuss.¬† Faculty advisor for the Grey Street Gay Straight Alliance.¬† Left behind a wife and two small children.

Clarence Wright, 18.¬† A beast on the football field, a big teddy bear everywhere else.¬† He was the guy who‚Äôd walk girls to their cars at night and buy ice cream bars for little kids in his apartment block.¬† Allison Chang told the police Brent had aimed for her first, but Clarence tried to tackle him and got in the way.

Corrine Schultz, 16.¬† Corrine ran JV track, drew comics, and had the voice of an angel.¬† She solo‚Äôed at Glee Club performances and always landed the lead role in the school musical.¬† Loved Anime and Adult Swim.

Olivia Wu, 17.¬† She played the saxophone in jazz band and baked delicious cookies, which she brought to school and shared with anyone lucky enough to be in her homeroom class.¬† The sweetest girl ever.¬† Volunteered for a suicide hotline.

Anna Abromovic, 15.¬† Anna was a certified genius.¬† Though only a sophomore, she‚Äôd been placed in my calculus class and helped all us seniors with our homework.¬† An out-and-proud, unapologetic fan of both Dungeons and Dragons and Justin Bieber.

Caitlin Rodriguez and Beth Lewis, both 16.¬† I didn‚Äôt know either of them well.¬† But they‚Äôd been best friends since kindergarten, were co-editors of the school paper, and Caitlin had donated her bone marrow when Beth‚Äôs youngest brother was diagnosed with leukemia.¬†

\*\*\*\*\*

We‚Äôre all trapped in reality.¬† And in real life, you can‚Äôt reboot the game and try again.

Their stories ended before they should‚Äôve, their boundless potential cut short.¬† They deserved so much better.¬† I can‚Äôt go back in time and save them.

Someday, I wake up at 5:00 a.m., grab my hair, make a ponytail, wash my face, and make some coffee for myself. Then, I start my long walk of thoughts. This period of time is very important to me. During this particular time, I think about life my life, the living organisms around us, how they function, how they think. I reflect on how ordinary we seem, yet how extraordinary we can be. It all depends on our thinking, and how important thinking truly is.

Thinking is like a tool a powerful tool you‚Äôve been given to solve your problems, or perhaps even create them. It‚Äôs just a lot of thinking. We are so capable so incredibly capable but most of us don‚Äôt even realize it.

Maybe there is something else you are meant for, something you don‚Äôt know yet, but one day, you will. And I‚Äôm sorry you haven‚Äôt been given all the opportunities you deserve to explore. You deserve to find your passions, to dream freely about who you want to become, and how you want to feel.

One day, you will have it all. You are strong, and your thoughts are powerful. Never forget that.

\- I'm likely going to bring a pen or two to have worked on... one that has a nib needing tuning and one that... leaks from the feed. Any suggestions as to which vendor/nibmeister/etc at the show is the best for each of these issues? Any to avoid?

Thanks so much for any advice, I really want to make the most of this first experience!

Edit to Add: Any must-visit Dealers? Any ""avoid at all costs""? There's only a couple of modern pens I'm still eyeing to acquire, but there are several vintage pens on my wish list.",5,1735175025.0,fountainpens,0,0.78,False

1hmd9au,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hmd9au/aio_for_feeling_my_mother_ruined_christmas/,AIO for feeling my mother ruined christmas,"I (40f) made christmas plans with my parents (66f) (68m)for them to come over for both Christmas eve and Christmas day. Christmas day they would stay until 3 pm because they had a 3 and a half hour ride home.  

A few days before christmas eve my sister (33f) (we haven't been on best terms) asked my mother what her plans were. My mother told me, so despite our strained relationship (figured it's time to let things go and make peace) I said I would invite her for christmas day and did. She said yes and the plans were made. 

We were originally going to do Chinese for dinner on christmas day but changed it once my sister was coming over because my parents said they would treat but changed it to me going half. (not my sister) We ended up buying a bunch of food to cook instead since that would be nicer. Christmas eve went smooth and my parents stayed in a hotel because that is what they like to do. 

The following day is where the disaster began. My parents were suppose to come at 9 am as the kids (19f,11m,8f,7f,) were waiting for them to open their presents under the tree and my mom loves watching and being involved. At 10 am i called my mom and this is where it all really started I informed my mother that my sister would not be making it over because her partner was ill throwing up since 4 am. I thought it was best since she was also nauseous (though not throwing up) she stay home and we make plans for another day when they aren't feeling ill. Mind you at this point it's been an hour and my mom had not even reached out to me about being late or anything.  

My mother totally lost it and flipped out on me. She went off the handle screaming on the phone how she was just going to go home. I ended the call here. A few minutes later she kept repeatedly calling me, my husbasnd and daughter, we didn't answer because we were trying to enjoy christmas with the kids. Like 15 min later i called my father because I felt at this point she was out of line and I had every right to inform my sister it's best since their sick that they stay home.  I hear my mother immediately yelling again. 

My father tells me they have to come to my house because after driving around all morning no restaurants were open and my mom needed to eat. It's a routine for them they always get breakfast out before coming to our house when they stay a night. My mother just likes eating out and uses any reason to do so even though I'm perfectly capable and willing to make food. So I agree and let her come. Apparently they stopped at 7 11 to get eggs as if I didn't have any... I really don't know why she does these things it feels insulting. So they both eat and she was upset the kids already opened the gifts when she said she wasnt coming and was already over an hour past 9 am, and then rushes to leave so they can get home by 4 for my sister to instead come to their house. 

Basically just blowing me and my family off leaving us with no christmas plans. They left in such a rush my oldest didn't even get to give her her christmas gift.  My oldest whose 19 was upset my younger kids were upset too. I felt this was extremely disrespectful and rude. I feel like they just came to eat and take thier chicken back that was going to be cooked today and take left over ham for my sister. And all of this because I didn't want someone knowingly sick in my house. So instead of staying until 3 on christmas day and arriving at 9 am they rushed to leave and left by 11ish am and first arrived 10 30 ish. She also had already celebrated the holidays with my sister a few weeks proir leaving us with no plans. We could have had my fil over for christmas day but didn't because they were suppose to be here and my mother doesn't like him. 

2 hours after she leaves she messages me saying the hot chocolate and other coffees she brought to my home and told my oldest daughter were for her, were for my sister.

I feel my mother was out of line and disrespectful, and just totally bailed on us AIO?

The FitnessGram‚Ñ¢ Pacer Test is a physical test in which participants are challenged to run a 20-meter distance back and forth in under a certain time. The test goes up to 247 beeps (21 levels), spanning 22 minutes and 6 seconds. The test originated in 1977 when the Director of Health and Physical Education of the Richardson, Texas school system, Charles L. Sterling, recognized that school administration and parents were interested in seeing a physical fitness ‚Äúreport card‚Äù.



In 1981, Dr. Sterling joined the staff of the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas. The Institute had a mainframe computer that allowed batch processing of the physical fitness reports. This created the opportunity to take the concept to a wider audience, but a name was needed. FITNESSGRAM¬Æ was chosen through a contest in the local school district. Nancy Voith is credited for having the winning entry.

Throughout the test, there is a number of jazz and funk instrumentals in the background. These beats include ‚ÄúHi Rollers‚Äù by Matthew Corbett and Mike Wilkie, ‚ÄúBorn to Funk‚Äù by Stephan Sechi, ‚ÄúWild One‚Äù and ‚ÄúGroove Ride‚Äù by Pete Stanford,.

In total, throughout the 22-minute test, 247 20-meter distances could have been completed, equalling 4,940 meters, or 3.07 miles.",1,1735174724.0,u_Glum-Flan8458,0,1.0,False
1hmd8ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/1hmd8ql/dating_advice_entp_f_x_intjp_m/,Dating advice ENTP (f) x INTJ/P (m),"Okay, so I met this amazing guy, and we had the best date ever. We both have been single for a couple of years, and it was supposed to just be a coffee meet-up (not a date), but turned into dinner and an amazing night. I assume he is either INTJ or INTP, leaning J. I rarely have that kind of intellectual, emotional and physical connection with someone. I felt like I could truly by myself, and he felt the same way. We were both really impressed with how compatible we were. 

However, he told me he‚Äôs not a big texted/phone person. I‚Äôve noticed this before because before we arranged the coffee meet up, his texts were really to the point, short and clear. He lives about 2 hours away and we both have extremely busy jobs and schedules, but I‚Äôve been looking to relocate to his area for work. I don‚Äôt need a partner I speak to daily and I prefer someone who is as ambitious as I am. 

Anyway, since he‚Äôs not a big texter I‚Äôve been kind of lost on how to communicate. We have been sending some texts back and forth. Usually with an 6-24 hour response time in between. I‚Äôve noticed though my insecurities are kicking in‚ÄîI literally never like anyone so I feel like I don‚Äôt want to let this person slip away. I texted him a week ago I‚Äôd be on holiday leave and that I‚Äôd be happy to meet up somewhere because I‚Äôd like to see him again. He responded that he feels the same way and wants to see me again as well and send a kiss emoji. After that I just said: that‚Äôs great! And we never actually set a date.

After Christmas leave days are limited for both of us and I feel like I might be pressuring him if I bring it up again. I know he feels like with his career it‚Äôs not ideal to be in a relationship (he‚Äôs away most of the week) but since I need a lot of alone time I wouldn‚Äôt mind at all. I don‚Äôt mind the slow texting either. It‚Äôs just that I just want to know whether or not there will be a second date and when. I keep getting scared he‚Äôll change his mind.

I spoke to him on Monday about something work related, and we checked in on how we were doing. Mid conversation he sort of stopped replying, so now I have these last texts I‚Äôve sent him (responding to a link he sent me‚Äîand ending with saying I never know if I should text him or not to ask how he‚Äôs doing since he said he doesn‚Äôt like small talk like that and I don‚Äôt either but that he‚Äôs on my mind a lot.) Anyway, it‚Äôs Christmas so we‚Äôre both busy and my message didn‚Äôt really require a response.

But my question is: should I just text him to ask if he‚Äôs free to meet up between Christmas and new years? Or should I keep waiting for him to initiate?

TLDR; had an amazing first date, guy isn‚Äôt a texter/phone person. Both have super busy schedules, live 2 hours apart. I‚Äôve been texting more than he has, but he did say he wants to see me again. We only have time off between Christmas and NY. Should I ask him on a second date or wait for him to not scare him off? 

For context: I‚Äôm in my 30s, he‚Äôs in his 40‚Äôs. 10 years apart. ",2,1735174684.0,entp,1,1.0,False

I come from a family of 9 sisters and brothers (I‚Äôm the second youngest). 
I have been a single parent for over 15 years raising 3 boys pretty much on my own. My family very much looked down on the fact that I wasn‚Äôt married and dint have a degree. So I went to University and 
studied for 7 year‚Äôs and finally graduated with Masters in Music and I work full time. 

I‚Äôm been in a blended relationship with my youngest sons father for 7 years and we live separately now  so I still feel like I‚Äôm a single parent cause blended relationship cause us to split for a year when we lived together, but now we are back together. However this dint help the opinion of my family.


However I thought this would make my family respect me as as I have a partner and a steady job and accept me and ultimately like me more, however I couldn‚Äôt ask my mom to baby sit or meet me for a coffee yet  my sister with all her  partners family support gets my mom baby sitting her child.

They organise family trips to Byron, dinner dates and lunch‚Äôs together and never invite me. I‚Äôm lucky to see my mom once every 6 months yet we live in the same state and my sister visits from interstate and sees her more frequently. 
I should also mention my family is very wealthy from making money on property and because I woke a 9-5 job and not an entrepreneur, they look down on it.

My only peace comes from playing music (busking) on weekends, it makes me forget about the rejection and try and bring some positivity to myself and community.

I‚Äôm trying to be really optimistic and accept that my family don‚Äôt like me for whatever reason, however when Christmas comes, I walk into my mothers home and it‚Äôs really awkward. And to makes matters worse my partners family I‚Äôm not close with. 
So I‚Äôm feeling really lonely and down.
My question is how do I leave my best life knowing that my family dosent like me not matter how nice I am to them.
Do I make my friends my family? 
And just accept that this is the way life is?

Hoping to get some advice/insight on this situation I‚Äôm in as I continue to get mixed signals, leading me to honestly feel so lost in all this.

So I (27M) have this friend, let‚Äôs call her Patty (25F). We‚Äôve known each other almost our whole lives (we‚Äôre both of the same ethnicity so we‚Äôve always had mutual family friends). Throughout our lives we were never really friends, not for any particular reason, we knew each other but just never got to actually know each other. 

About 3 years ago, I happened to meet her cousin in law, let‚Äôs call her Kat, through this company i worked for at the time. Kat and I hit it off and became close friends very quickly. Kat would invite me to her family functions, kids‚Äô bday parties, Christmas parties, etc. Of course Patty and the rest of her family (she has a pretty big family) would always be there.

About a year in, Kat helped her cousin Patty get a job at the company, and that‚Äôs when we started to really see each other often and actually get to know each other more. We became basically work best friends, and began to hang out and talk more outside of work, however it was not anything too significant at the time. Nothing flirty or anything of that manner.

Also, for some backstory, between 2018 through summer of 2024, I was in a LTR. So honestly, when me and Patty started to work together and become closer and closer of friends, I never saw her in a romantic way like that. For one, I was in a devoted relationship and am not the type to cheat. Additionally, I don‚Äôt feel like I was ever attracted to Patty at the time. I mean sure she‚Äôs an attractive woman, but I never really looked at her in that way.

After about a year of working together, I ended up moving to another company. Patty and I kept in touch but would not really see each other or talk to each other regularly. I was still in a relationship, so I never had any feeling or urge to constantly reach out or see her. And although we were very good friends, I haven‚Äôt always been the best at staying in touch with all my friends especially over the course of time during my relationship. 

To add some more details, I‚Äôve been dealing with a pretty serious chronic medical condition over the last 6 years of my life. Although Patty and I hadn‚Äôt been seeing each other much after leaving my last job, she would consistently do things to support me and show me she cared about me and my health. She would bring me supplements, food, and just little gifts to uplift my spirits. She also would consistently try to get through to me spiritually and bring me closer to god, who my relationship with has been strained for quite a while now. She‚Äôs been very much a rock for me over this past year. She‚Äôs very grounded and it‚Äôs refreshing. I feel that my life has been in shambles and she tends to help me feel more put together I guess. I truly admire her and her character.

This year, Patty and I have been a lot closer. We started talking and seeing each other more often towards the beginning of the year. We‚Äôd hang out maybe once every 2 months for the first half of 2024. Which was more than we really would before.

This past July, my ex and I broke up, and within the same 2 weeks, Patty and a guy she was talking to at the time called it quits. We were there for each other, as a shoulder to lean/cry on. We started seeing each other even more often then. It became more like once a week or every other week. At first it was constantly talking about our relationship trauma. But those scars inevitably healed and we would just find ourselves hanging out to just hang out n be around each other.

Her bday was a few months ago, and she even texted me at midnight while I was out of the country at the time to tell me to call her so i could be the first to wish her a happy birthday. We would go to coffee shops often to work, and she would consistently refer to them as ‚Äúcafe dates.‚Äù She constantly invites me to her family outings, where I‚Äôm the only non-family there. When we hang out, I find that we‚Äôre always physically very close. Nothing in that sense has happened at all, but there‚Äôs definitely a level of comfortability there where I can touch her arm/leg or her hair without there being anything odd about it. She even came over last week and stayed up super late with me 2 nights in a row, sitting super close and watching movies together.

I‚Äôve tried to be subtly flirty many times but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just terrible at flirting now or if she just doesn‚Äôt acknowledge it as that. I try to compliment her quite often, every time I see her I‚Äôll always comment on something about her outfit or hair or whatever. But idk, I feel like it feels a bit forced. I also am a textbook over thinker, so that never helps what‚Äôs going through my head.

My friends, coworkers, family, and therapist all think that I have developed these more intimate feelings towards her. They also think that she has some level of interest as well. I just don‚Äôt know if I see it. They seem to be so confident that she‚Äôs interested in me given the way our friendship has been over the last few months, but something tells me it‚Äôs not exactly like that. 

A few weeks ago when we were hanging out, she even asked me for help transferring some photos from her phone to laptop. Come to find out that this album she was transferring was full of old pictures and videos of her and her exes. I seen the album as I was helping her and it honestly really turned me off and kindve annoyed me a bit. That‚Äôs when I knew that I was really feeling these feelings for her. I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that something like that is something you‚Äôd show a ‚Äúgay best friend.‚Äù I feel like if she saw me in any romantic way, that might not be something to show me.

Idk I feel like I‚Äôm rambling here and idk if it even all makes sense. My feelings are just so conflicted and it‚Äôs been shitty. My therapist thinks I should just be straight with her, but I feel like I‚Äôm scared of the result. I genuinely care about her so much and she makes me happy, but idk if I could stay a friend to her. But I also don‚Äôt want to lose her.",0,1735173910.0,dating_advice,4,0.5,False

Hey. I'm doing seven days in Forsyth county jail. I want to.know about the tablets.

1 are there free books you can read on the tablet 

2. If i sign up for the 7 day e book subscribtion do I just pay for it and get to use the books I want? And read as much as I want? Or do they charge you by the minute to read? 

I just want my wife to buy me the coffee pack, a tablet subscription for 7 days of e books, and some money on the phone to call her to say good night. Nothing fancy.

But if they charge per minute on the books i won't do that. Are there some free books  in the tablet?

They said she could.do that Friday night when she drops me off and I should have my coffee pack by Monday morning...the e books should go right on the tablet. Does that sound right? Idc about snacks and noodles. Just coffee and books. And phone time.

Anybody know what the 7 day book subscription costs? Thanks all. Just trying to not go crazy in there. Minimum comforts.",0,1735173749.0,probation,14,0.4,False
