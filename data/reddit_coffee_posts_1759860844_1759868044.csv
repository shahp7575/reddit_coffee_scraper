This might be a long shot, but I met someone during my recent trip from Amsterdam to Rotterdam, and even though we talked for about 2 hours only, something about the moment stayed!

I didn't ask her name or number, maybe because it felt like the kind of moment you don't want to break with practicality, but here's what I remembered:  
1. She lives in Paris  
2. Studying a Master's in Human Migration.  
3. We met at Amsterdam Sloterdijk station, while waiting for our FlixBus to Rotterdam, around 8 am on 02.10.2025. The bus was delayed for 2 hours. 

  
I am not expecting any miracles, but I just wanted to put this out there ---- sometimes the world is smaller than we think.

If by some crazy coincidence this reaches her, tell her the coffee companion from Amsterdam says Hi!",1,1759867421.0,findsomeone,0,1.0,False

1o0pk1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1o0pk1m/aita_for_sleeping_with_my_husbands_rich_brother/,AITA for sleeping with my husband's rich brother after making him sleep on the couch for months because he was 'just a teacher'?,"My husband's brother just bought the house I lost in the divorce and invited my ex to move in with him.

So here's the whole mess. Three years ago my husband was working as a teacher and I was basically supporting us on my salary from my corporate job. He kept saying he loved teaching but I was tired of being the breadwinner. I started making comments about how he couldn't provide for a family. How my friends' husbands made real money. How embarrassing it was when people asked what he did.

I told him to sleep on the couch until he figured out his career. He said that was cruel but I said real men don't complain. He slept there for four months.

His brother was different. Successful. He ran his own consulting firm and had the kind of life I wanted. He came over for dinner one night and my husband was exhausted from teaching and grading papers. His brother was wearing an expensive watch and talking about his new condo downtown.

I started texting him. Just friendly stuff at first. Then it turned into late night conversations about how I felt trapped. He said I deserved better. We met for coffee. Then drinks. Then his place.

My husband found out because his brother's guilt got the better of him and he confessed. My husband just stared at me when I got home that night. He said, ""With my own brother?""

I told him if he had been more successful this wouldn't have happened. I actually said that. He filed for divorce the next week.

The divorce was brutal. I thought I'd get the house since I paid most of the mortgage. But turns out the courts don't care about that when you cheat. He got the house. I got nothing except my car and my clothes.

Then I lost my job. The economy tanked and my company did layoffs. I had to move into a studio apartment. Meanwhile my ex kept teaching and seemed fine. Better than fine actually. He started dating someone new. A guidance counselor from his school. I saw them on social media looking happy.

His brother cut all contact with me after the divorce. Said what we did was unforgivable and he couldn't live with himself. That he'd betrayed his only sibling for nothing.

I got desperate. I talked to a lawyer about suing my ex for emotional damages. I said he abandoned me financially and caused me severe depression and anxiety by forcing me into this situation. The lawyer actually laughed. He said I had no case. That I was the one who cheated and made my own bed.

But here's where it gets worse.

Last month my ex sold the house. I found out his brother bought it. For cash. At asking price. And then his brother asked my ex to move in with him. Rent free.

Apparently they're rebuilding their relationship. His brother is in therapy trying to make amends. My ex is saving money and talking about going back to school for his master's degree.

And I'm here in my studio apartment eating ramen and applying for jobs that pay half what I used to make. My friends stopped calling after they heard what I did. My family barely speaks to me except my mom who calls once a week to ask if I've apologized yet.

I drove by the house last weekend. They were having a barbecue in the backyard. I could see them laughing. My ex looked genuinely happy. His brother was flipping burgers. They looked like brothers again.

I sat in my car across the street for twenty minutes before someone noticed and I had to leave.

My mom says I need to take accountability for what I did. That I destroyed my marriage because I was selfish and cruel. That sleeping with his brother was beyond forgivable. She's probably right but it's hard to accept that I ruined everything and there's no way back.

The lawsuit idea was stupid. I know that now. But I was grasping at anything to feel like I had some control. Some way to make him hurt the way I'm hurting. Except he's not hurting. He's healing. And I'm stuck here watching his life get better while mine falls apart.

I haven't spoken to either of them since the divorce was finalized eight months ago. Part of me wants to show up at that house and beg for forgiveness. But I know I don't deserve it. And I know they'd just close the door in my face.

So am I the worst person alive or is there any universe where what I did makes sense?

1o0pjyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1o0pjyi/is_everybody_secretly_microdosing_ozempic_without/,Is Everybody Secretly Microdosing Ozempic Without You?,"What used to be a whisper—*I’m on* [*Ozempic*](https://www.vogue.com/article/what-is-ozempic-hollywood-weight-loss-drug)—has recently become a shout. Celebrities like Serena Williams, Oprah, and Kelly Clarkson are on the jab—a.k.a. an injectionable medication like Ozempic, Zepbound, or Mounjaro, which are synthetic versions of the GLP-1 hormone our body produces—and the results typically include weight loss.

“GLP-1 is short for glucagon-like peptide-1, a hormone that we produce in our gut after we eat,” says Rocio Salas-Whalen, a board-certified physician who specializes in obesity medicine and endocrinology. Some 90% of Dr. Salas-Whalen’s patients are currently on a form of the medication, and it inspired her to write the book [*Weightless*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/806992/weightless-by-rocio-salas-whalen-md/), due out in December. “The main function of this hormone is to regulate glucose, but it also helps us feel full after we eat, reduces cravings, and slows down gastric emptying. We have receptors for this hormone all throughout our bodies. GLP-1 medications, such as Ozempic and Zepbound, are long-acting versions of our body’s GLP-1 hormone and have the same effects.”

Last year [one in eight Americans](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-the-publics-use-and-views-of-glp-1-drugs/) reported having tried one of the drugs, which is typically prescribed to those with diabetes or obesity, because of the weight-loss side effect.

The latest trend tied to the drug? Microdosing. *Watch What Happens Live* host Andy Cohen recently confessed that he’s been doing it on his show *Radio Andy.*

“Given that for 20 years I have been asking people about their body regimens and that I’ve been pretty vocal about every time I go on a diet, I think it would be completely hypocritical not to share,” Cohen says. “This summer, \[I lost\] a good chunk of weight by microdosing a GLP-1.” The father of two said he was unhappy with his weight, but other health concerns, like “plaque in my arteries and high blood pressure,” motivated his decision to go on the drug.

“Microdosing a GLP-1 refers to taking a dose that is smaller than the FDA-approved therapeutic dose,” says Dr. Salas-Whalen. Dave Asprey—founder of [Bulletproof Coffee](https://www.bulletproof.com/) and inventor of the term *biohacking*, whom I’d sort of describe as a male version of Gwyneth Paltrow—agrees that microdosing is a fad that he hopes passes. Asprey began his weight-loss journey in 1995, weighing in at 300 pounds. It wasn’t exactly done what we would call the old-fashioned way (a.k.a. just diet and exercise) because his tactics involved then experimental techniques [like MCT oil](https://www.vogue.com/article/bulletproof-coffee), but he didn’t have GLP-1s as an option at the time.

“We’re all obsessed with GLP-1s right now because they deliver visible results in the short term and we live in a world that loves a quick fix,” Asprey tells me. “For someone who’s severely obese, that can be a real breakthrough. But the catch is that in most cases, you’re not just losing fat, you’re losing muscle. And it’s not just a little muscle. Scientists compare the muscle loss from GLP-1s to severe starvation.” He adds that he only tried a version of the drug once but “felt like I had morning sickness the entire time and thought, I really don’t want to feel like this all the time.”

For one anonymous *Vogue* employee, microdosing Ozempic has been a breakthrough. “I have a binge eating problem,” she tells me at the office. “When I was on a standard dose, people were noticing and a lot of people were commenting on how bad I looked. People kept saying, ‘Your head looks big.’ I was also so tired.” After working with her prescriber, they settled on her taking the smallest dose approved by the FDA—0.5 ml—but every other week, instead of weekly.

And while the *Vogue* staffer has nothing but good things to say about her microdosing experience, experts warn this isn’t the way the GLP-1 drugs are meant to be used. “The thought \[behind microdosing\] was that by giving a smaller dose than the initial therapeutic dose, they would avoid the side effects,” says Dr. Salas-Whalen. “What does microdosing do to the body? Not much. If you’re looking to lose weight and regulate glucose, you want to take the therapeutic doses that have been studied and proven to produce the effects that the drug was designed to have on your body.” She does, however, offer a caveat: “I have seen some patients benefit from a very low maintenance-level dosage after reaching their fat-loss goal, though this should be done under the supervision of an experienced provider.”

1o0pj44,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1o0pj44/the_boy_who_slipped_the_worlds_grasp/,The Boy Who Slipped the World’s Grasp,"Somewhere in the past, a little boy in space pajamas is lying on a rug, chin in hands, staring up at the television as if it were the stars. The living room is dark, full of flickering shadows, its walls washed in the dim blue light of the television screen. It’s a Philco make, with a rabbit ear antenna wrapped in glimmering tin foil, and two large dials on the wooden panel to the right. One dial is for the volume; the other, for switching the station.

But that television set is really a time machine, and those dials are the controls. He only needs to turn the second one and—swoosh!

He’s whisked off to impossible futures and fantastic pasts. Whole worlds unravel before him. The screen becomes a window out of which he sees these worlds streaking by at light speed. 

Just outside, Tarzan wrestles a leopard, a mighty ape scales the Empire State Building swatting biplanes like flies, a monster from the deep carries a fainted beauty back to his underwater lair, styrofoam pillars crumble onto Philistine city-dwellers, and clay stop-motion dinosaurs roam prehistoric valleys at the foot of a smoldering volcano. 

His stay in each of these worlds is brief. If he lingers too long, he might forget—might never come back. 

Sometimes he thinks his fate could be a lot worse…

The world he’s from, the one he leaves behind every time he turns on the television, becomes more dull, flat, two dimensional as these other worlds around him expand. He decides he doesn’t really want to go back. 

Everyday, after school, and on the early mornings of the weekend, he heads straight for the living room where his time machine waits for him, sometimes leaving behind a trail of schoolbooks, socks, and tennis shoes. There’s talk from men in ties on less important channels. The same words that have come buzzing over the radio every day and have been on the lips of his parents at the dinner table—talk about wars, and hunger, and bombs. About labor strikes, and stock market crashes and violent protests. He doesn’t understand. He turns the switch again; this time he’s in Egypt dawning a pith helmet, recovering a sarcophagus from a cursed tomb. 

Television has been there for him when his parents weren’t, has given him all his life experiences. It’s where he first learned about love (to the extent a pre-adolescent boy could understand such a thing.) It was Anne Francis searching for a thimble in a darkened mall during after-hours who first won his ten-year-old heart…or was it as the radiant Altaira, flitting beneath the gleam of twin suns on a distant planet? 

He learned about loss too, after witnessing firsthand as a courageous Labrador Retriever loyally fought off a rabid wolf to protect the young boy he so prized. Artificial experiences. Mere shadows he doesn’t really understand. But that doesn’t matter to him in the least. 
To the boy, the television set isn’t just a contraption, some amalgamation of wires, and fuses, and tubes. It’s a genie’s bottle, a magic chest not too different from the one a magician employs to saw his alluring assistant in half. He hasn’t the slightest clue how it all works but is captivated by what it delivers just the same. If it were up to him, he would sit in front of it forever. 
A few years have passed now. The boy is thirteen. The television sits like an artifact from another time. There’s a crack trailing across the screen like a spider web and a hole in the wooden panel where tangled wires protrude. The boy sometimes turns the switch, hoping an image will appear, that the screen will flicker to life. But it remains blackened.

The living room is cold and ill-lit. Oil lamps have replaced most other forms of lighting in the house. A crowd of people, former neighbors, and even some strangers, gather near a small wood-burning stove in the kitchen, rubbing their gloved hands together to keep warm. They eat out of cans they’ve foraged for during the day and drink coffee, always black and bitter. The sounds of hoarse voices, of coughs and sniffles, can be heard through the paper-thin walls. The windows are shattered and stained, the wallpaper is peeling, and dirt and ash cover the once carpeted hardwood floors. 

Nothing has been the same since the boy woke up in the middle of the night and the world outside his window looked like day. There was a mighty crack of thunder and a horrible gust of wind that sent him toppling over. Now everything is gray. The cedar and hackberry trees that once shaded the house look like burnt matchsticks, and food and laughter, like most everything, is scarce.

Now a poisonous, brown rain is flooding the gutters, gushing down the eaves, and the gables, and the spouts. There’s a deafening sound of a million lead beads dropping upon the rooftop. The house creaks as the wind bellows outside. 

The boy shivers. 

He makes his way up the stairs and into the attic in search of a new blanket. His old one is worn beyond use. He finds a filthy wool quilt buried in cardboard boxes of used clothes and medical supplies—of iodine pills, and radio parts, and batteries and other scavenged miscellany. As he pulls the blanket from the box, something slips out and hits the floor sending up a cloud of dust, disturbing the musty air.

A book. 

The cover is faded and there’s a tear in the jacket. The boy squints at it curiously as he mouths the words printed on the front, 

*Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*. 

He sits down in the corner of the attic with a lantern; the blanket draped over his thin shoulders. Outside, the rain is still pounding, and the wind still moaning through the rafters. But he can’t hear them anymore. Five pages becomes ten pages becomes a hundred. He puts down the book and retrieves another from the same box. This time jungle stories about a feral boy raised by wolves. 

He flips through dusty yellowed pages and gets lost in the space between. Somewhere in the attic, the lantern softly burns, and a draft stirs some dust bunnies gathered on the sill of a boarded window. But the boy isn’t there. He’s searching for treasure on an uncharted island, manning the helm of a pirate ship. He’s sailing through stars, and perching on house tops, and steeples, and chimneys. He’s tapping at the nursery windows of other children, beckoning to them to join him in his flight. He’s speaking in the ancient tongue of a race long forgotten, conversing with wild animals, and lazing on a raft as it steadily drifts down river, the sunlight warming his body. The corner is empty. The boy isn’t there. He’s ‘slipped the surly bonds of earth.’ He’s taken flight. He’s escaped.

But to be fair, you and your old adventuring buddies didn't exactly have an audience when you averted that prophecy.","### Bagels

""FP'BHGL WILL LIGHT THE WORLD AFLAME! WE ARE BUT SEEDS FOR A NEW WORLD!"" The crier shouted in the middle of the square. He threw some kind of pamphlet into the air — but being pamphlets instead of leaflets, they simply fell back to the ground instead of floating about. The nearby students looked at the man pitifully — another victim to final-exams-induced-insanity. Studying was dangerous business.
  
""Hey, did he just say 'floppy bagel'? Isn't that the name of the grimoire you—""

I cut him off, ""Zip it. No one needs to remember what happened, Erik.""

He aimlessly moved the papers around on the table. We were working on a group project — though how much work was actually getting down was questionable, given the size of his brain. It being a coffee shop in the middle of the busiest campus square didn't help either. Erik shrugged, ""We were all there, Jan. Hard to forget someone putting out a fire by pissing on it — made quite the smell.""

""It was the only liquid I had on hand dammit! It's your fault! You had been making me drink all night, there was nothing left!""

""It's you're fault you're such a wisp when it comes to alcohol, heh. Amiright, Nilah?"" Erik turned to the last member of our group, who put her hand on her chin and looked up in thought.

""It did smell,"" she said with a small smirk. There was something else on her face I couldn't quite identify, a little awkwardness maybe.

I blushed. I was drunk off my ass, no thanks to a certain flopface. Forget remembering how it had led up to that, I barely even remembered pulling out the grimoire I had stolen from the dean's office and reading it. She had probably seen something I hadn't meant to show her — maybe multiple somethings.

""Don't worry about the book. Nothing introducing itself 'floppy bagel' can be that bad. I'm sure the dean won't miss the talking book — he sure won't want it back now after you've burned and unloaded on it,"" Erik smiled.

I changed the topic, ""Hey, are you just going to shuffle those papers around — or do you actually plan to *do* any of the calculations? We would already be done if *someone* did their part of the assignment instead of showing up with two handles last night.""

""Hey relax, Big J. I'm doing my part, it just isn't where you think it is."" He gave a very punch-able smile, then exchanged a look with Nilah who shot him a glare. What was that about?

I frowned, ""Did something happen... last night? I mean aside from the burning book stuff.""

""Nah, just the usual, you being an idiot and—""

""I wasn't talking to you, asshat.""

Nilah pursed her lips. The way she played with her hair when she had something on her mind was seriously cute. She shook her head, ""No, don't worry about it. It's not important.""

So something *did* happen. ""Wait. Fuck. I'm sorry if I did something, I wasn't thinking straight. I don't remember—""

""FP'BHGL SEES ALL. HE KNOWS ALL. WE WILL ALL BE EATEN. IT WILL TASTEFUL.""

I nearly jumped out of my chair. The crier hadn't shouted into my ear, but there was an unexpected weight to his words — and I hadn't expected him to be standing right behind me. I turned to him, ""Uhh, sure buddy.""

I paused, ""Wait. Don't I know you?""

""We had Forbidden Texts 102 together last semester. I sat across from you,"" he said in a surprisingly normal voice.

I looked at my two friends for help, but they both decided that I would take care of the insane interloper for them. Fuckers. ""Oh. Uh, yeah. That's right, I remember now. Hey, if you don't mind, we've got to work on our project. It's due by the end of the week. Nice talking to you.""

He stood there silently looking at me. Even the way he *blinked* was ominous. Final-exams-induced-insanity was no joke.

I turned back to the project papers and began working on the subspace calculations for shape retention that Erik was supposed to have already done. After a minute I looked up at Nilah and said, ""He isn't still behind me, is he?""

She laughed, ""No, he left. Do you think we should add error handling here?""

I moved my chair closer and leaned in to take a look at where she was pointing, ""Technically it isn't needed — though also technically, *no* error handling is *ever* needed for my work.""

She rolled her eyes, but I could tell she liked the joke from the small turn of her lips. I don't know how long we worked sitting side by side like that — it must have been an hour at least, but I don't think she minded. I certainly didn't.

""Heya nerds, how goes the progress?"" Erik was holding a half-eaten bagel and a mug of beer. He coughed and thumped his chest to help swallow a bite. How long had he been gone?

""We just finished the design structure. All that's left is the formal report — which we're going to leave for a lazy slacker to do — by which I mean you, because I'm not sure if you're smart enough to understand nuance.""

""Hey, I understand nuance just fine. You're the one dense as a brick — maybe two bricks."" He shrugged and picked up his bag.

""Screw you.""

""Too bad, I'm taken.""

""Gross.""

""Hey you're the one who said it, not me. Send me the notes for the report later. I'm outta here."" He laughed and waved with his back to us as he began walking home. I watched him thump his chest again and throw the rest of his bagel away. Must've tasted awful, he usually finishes his food.

Nilah began putting her things away too, ""Should we... meet up again, before Friday, to go over what he's written?""

""Oh, he'll write up the report — if that's what you're worried about. He's a slacker and procrastinator, but he usually pulls through when it matters."" I said.

""No, I mean... wouldn't it be a good idea to look it over anyway?"" She curled her index finger around a lock of hair.

""Yeah, I guess. I'll send a message in the group chat.""

She smiled. There was something again on her face I couldn't quite read. 

*Nuance.* Oh. ***Oh.*** I paused while packing the remaining papers, ""Nilah, do you... want to grab dinner together?""

She beamed.

I want to kill and eat my girlfriend.



Hi. This is for anyone who reads confessions at three in the morning you freaks of the internet help me.



This is not anger. She hasn’t betrayed me. She folds laundry wrong, sings off-key in the shower, steals the last fry and smirks like it’s the most natural thing in the world. She laughs at the same stupid jokes. She is ordinary in the ways that make her perfect. People  men drift toward her like they’re pulled by a string. They orbit her. They touch the edges of the life I keep for us. I can’t bear the thought of them getting inside what is mine shes mine not theirs they shouldn't even think have a chance with a girl like her.



Love is a word that softens everything. I speak it like a prayer. I tell myself I’d marry her, buy a ring, learn the right vows  but vows can dissolve. People leave. Promises fray. So I’ve found a different kind of promise, a way to make her permanent: to keep the parts of her that are only hers, to keep the laugh that cracks when she’s delighted and the small scar on her knuckle from a bike crash last summer. In my head I call it devotion. In my head it is mercy.



I know how that sounds when you say it out loud. I know the word “mercy” is crooked here. But inside the rooms of my mind, everything is knitted into one long, rational story. I will be gentle. I tell myself this like a litany. I will be careful. I will honor her the way a collector honors a relic. I will never be cruel for cruelty’s sake. Cruelty is impulsive; what I want is forever.



There is hunger beneath it  a hollow that is not merely appetite, but a need to own absence itself. When she leaves, I imagine the space she leaves like a wound that will not close. How do you fix a wound that’s the size of another person? For me, the answer is the same as it always has been: hold tighter than anyone could pry loose. Make a place where no one can take her away.



I’ve tasted the strange, terrible calm that follows doing something monstrous. Once, years ago, I took something from someone who had already been taken by a reckless act. There are memories that comfort me because they prove I can cross the edge and still breathe. Those memories justify themselves inside my head; they are proof I understand consequence and prove im not insane. That’s part of the danger  I am sensible enough to make the horror feel like order. The meat is so devine i only crave more.



I have rehearsed this confession in quieter voices a thousand times the careful way I would talk to her, the way I would put her favorite sweater over a body that becomes, in my mind, an object of reverence. I think of softness, the curves. I think of the scent of her hair in the morning and how I would keep it always. I imagine rituals  not the kinds that teach you how to do something, exactly, but the kind that let you imagine it as a ceremony. There would be light. There would be steady hands. There would be timetables in my head that make the chaos tidy.



That’s the thing I think people don’t understand about me I don’t feel like a monster in the ways you expect. Monsters screech and burn evil things. I don’t feel like that I’m a lover. I feel like a curator of a life that, in my hands, is made permanent. I tell myself I am sparing her the cruelty of abandonment. I tell myself that forever is a gift, even if it is the last thing she ever has.



There will be ugliness. There will be sights and smells that I will not shield myself from in my private hours. I do not take pleasure in graphic detail for its own sake; the details are what prove the thing happened  they are evidence of the solidity of my love. I can imagine the soft give of her skin, the stubborn heat of a pulse that used to answer to me. I can imagine tracing the line where her fingers used to curl around mine. Those images knit into something that is not hunger alone but devotion so intense it demands a body to anchor to shes mine and i will have her to my self and myself alone.



I have told myself that because I am careful, because I am thinking ahead, because I will be gentle, I am not doing something monstrous. That is the distortion at the core. My tenderness is my own excuse. I do not see the person in those plans so much as the parts that belong to memory. I do not understand why that is wrong. The lack of understanding isn’t innocence; it is obsession erasing empathy. I cannot map the space between my intentions and the damage they will cause. I do not see her as someone with the right to resist my plan; I see her as the soul I must keep intact.



She thinks I have a hobby. She thinks I am learning to fix things, maybe taxidermy something I convinced her was harmless when she helped me buy supplies. She packed the boxes and laughed about how earnest I could be. She did not feel the cold beneath my jokes. She will be home at eight. She will unwind, drop her keys on the table, kick off her shoes. She will not know the calendar I have folded around this hour like a trap but its a trap of love i promise.



There is a calmness now that terrifies me more than the thought of anyone reading this. The calm means it could happen, and the fact that it feels so calm makes the whole plan seem inevitable. I tell myself I will whisper to her afterwards  tell her the truth, maybe in a voice she recognizes better and that will make everything right. I know that sentence is hollow. My mind catches it and knits a meaning into it that is not there. That is the real terror how easily my logic builds a home on a foundation of denial.



I am not asking you to stop me because the truth is, I don’t know if I will stop. Maybe this is only a dark exercise, the kind of confession you spill when your lamp is low and your coffee is cold. Maybe this is the last line I write before everything breaks. Maybe I will post again. Maybe this is the last thing I type with my hands before the room I live in becomes something different, and quieter, and full of a love that no one else can touch except me.



If you are someone who reads things like this at three in the morning and shivers, know that the shiver is not just in the image. The real chill is in the steady, soft voice telling you it is all for love.

I am going to kill and eat my girlfriend.

1o0pg1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o0pg1g/spthe_boy_who_slipped_the_worlds_grasp/,[SP]The Boy Who Slipped the World’s Grasp,"Somewhere in the past, a little boy in space pajamas is lying on a rug, chin in hands, staring up at the television as if it were the stars. The living room is dark, full of flickering shadows, its walls washed in the dim blue light of the television screen. It’s a Philco make, with a rabbit ear antenna wrapped in glimmering tin foil, and two large dials on the wooden panel to the right. One dial is for the volume; the other, for switching the station.

But that television set is really a time machine, and those dials are the controls. He only needs to turn the second one and—swoosh!

He’s whisked off to impossible futures and fantastic pasts. Whole worlds unravel before him. The screen becomes a window out of which he sees these worlds streaking by at light speed. 
Just outside, Tarzan wrestles a leopard, a mighty ape scales the Empire State Building swatting biplanes like flies, a monster from the deep carries a fainted beauty back to his underwater lair, styrofoam pillars crumble onto Philistine city-dwellers, and clay stop-motion dinosaurs roam prehistoric valleys at the foot of a smoldering volcano. 

His stay in each of these worlds is brief. If he lingers too long, he might forget—might never come back. 

Sometimes he thinks his fate could be a lot worse…

The world he’s from, the one he leaves behind every time he turns on the television, becomes more dull, flat, two dimensional as these other worlds around him expand. He decides he doesn’t really want to go back. 

Everyday, after school, and on the early mornings of the weekend, he heads straight for the living room where his time machine waits for him, sometimes leaving behind a trail of schoolbooks, socks, and tennis shoes. There’s talk from men in ties on less important channels. The same words that have come buzzing over the radio every day and have been on the lips of his parents at the dinner table—talk about wars, and hunger, and bombs. About labor strikes, and stock market crashes and violent protests. He doesn’t understand. He turns the switch again; this time he’s in Egypt dawning a pith helmet, recovering a sarcophagus from a cursed tomb. 
Television has been there for him when his parents weren’t, has given him all his life experiences. It’s where he first learned about love (to the extent a pre-adolescent boy could understand such a thing.) It was Anne Francis searching for a thimble in a darkened mall during after-hours who first won his ten-year-old heart…or was it as the radiant Altaira, flitting beneath the gleam of twin suns on a distant planet? 

He learned about loss too, after witnessing firsthand as a courageous Labrador Retriever loyally fought off a rabid wolf to protect the young boy he so prized. Artificial experiences. Mere shadows he doesn’t really understand. But that doesn’t matter to him in the least. 
To the boy, the television set isn’t just a contraption, some amalgamation of wires, and fuses, and tubes. It’s a genie’s bottle, a magic chest not too different from the one a magician employs to saw his alluring assistant in half. He hasn’t the slightest clue how it all works but is captivated by what it delivers just the same. If it were up to him, he would sit in front of it forever. 

A few years have passed now. The boy is thirteen. The television sits like an artifact from another time. There’s a crack trailing across the screen like a spider web and a hole in the wooden panel where tangled wires protrude. The boy sometimes turns the switch, hoping an image will appear, that the screen will flicker to life. But it remains blackened.

The living room is cold and ill-lit. Oil lamps have replaced most other forms of lighting in the house. A crowd of people, former neighbors, and even some strangers, gather near a small wood-burning stove in the kitchen, rubbing their gloved hands together to keep warm. They eat out of cans they’ve foraged for during the day and drink coffee, always black and bitter. The sounds of hoarse voices, of coughs and sniffles, can be heard through the paper-thin walls. The windows are shattered and stained, the wallpaper is peeling, and dirt and ash cover the once carpeted hardwood floors. 

Nothing has been the same since the boy woke up in the middle of the night and the world outside his window looked like day. There was a mighty crack of thunder and a horrible gust of wind that sent him toppling over. Now everything is gray. The cedar and hackberry trees that once shaded the house look like burnt matchsticks, and food and laughter, like most everything, is scarce.

Now a poisonous, brown rain is flooding the gutters, gushing down the eaves, and the gables, and the spouts. There’s a deafening sound of a million lead beads dropping upon the rooftop. The house creaks as the wind bellows outside. 
The boy shivers. 

He makes his way up the stairs and into the attic in search of a new blanket. His old one is worn beyond use. He finds a filthy wool quilt buried in cardboard boxes of used clothes and medical supplies—of iodine pills, and radio parts, and batteries and other scavenged miscellany. As he pulls the blanket from the box, something slips out and hits the floor sending up a cloud of dust, disturbing the musty air.

A book. 

The cover is faded and there’s a tear in the jacket. The boy squints at it curiously as he mouths the words printed on the front, 
      
*Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*.

He sits down in the corner of the attic with a lantern; the blanket draped over his thin shoulders. Outside, the rain is still pounding, and the wind still moaning through the rafters. But he can’t hear them anymore. Five pages becomes ten pages becomes a hundred. He puts down the book and retrieves another from the same box. This time jungle stories about a feral boy raised by wolves. 

He flips through dusty yellowed pages and gets lost in the space between. Somewhere in the attic, the lantern softly burns, and a draft stirs some dust bunnies gathered on the sill of a boarded window. But the boy isn’t there. He’s searching for treasure on an uncharted island, manning the helm of a pirate ship. He’s sailing through stars, and perching on house tops, and steeples, and chimneys. He’s tapping at the nursery windows of other children, beckoning to them to join him in his flight. He’s speaking in the ancient tongue of a race long forgotten, conversing with wild animals, and lazing on a raft as it steadily drifts down river, the sunlight warming his body. The corner is empty. The boy isn’t there. He’s ‘slipped the surly bonds of earth.’ He’s taken flight. He’s escaped.

My hobbies include running, making and drinking coffee, camping, shopping, and hiking. I ran a few half marathons last year, got out of shape this year, and am now training for next year. Although having friends to chat with online is fun, it would be great if you were local and down to hang out. 

For gaming, I play a lot of Overwatch. It would be cool to find someone to team up with. I also just finished TLOU 1 and 2, and looking for other games to get into. I play on PC.

* Watch 5 minutes of Udemy video
* Meditate for 5 minutes
* Do 5 pushups
* Do 5 squats
* Do 45s wall sit
* Avoid coffee
* Keep phone outside of bedroom before sleeping

I'd also like to reduce my screen time usage:

* Reduce social mediate usage (Instagram, Tiktok, etc.)
* Stream video services (Netflix, Tubi, Youtube, etc.)
* Phone usage

In terms of relationships, I want to maintain my marriage. If you're a female and can offer advice, this would be helpful:

I’m on week 6 overall, and week 2 of being bumped up to 40mg. I’ve been on Wellbutrin for depression for more than 10 years, but was getting the prescription from my PCP that whole time and decided to talk to a psych to see if something else might help the persistent fatigue and lack of motivation. Since Prozac is more activating she recommended we start there and still continue the Wellbutrin.

Side effects are a little bizarre but not unmanageable so far. Had a couple instances of a little extra anxiety at 20mg and my doc immediately wanted to switch me to something else, but I asked to stick it out another month at least and she bumped me up to 40 to see how it goes. I learned my lesson about making sure I take it on a *full* stomach (a banana + coffee + Prozac + a bumpy car ride through city streets = no fun at all). Appetite has been slightly less, a little jittery at times, and if anything it’s increased libido instead of decreased. It hasn’t quite tackled the fatigue the way I want it to yet, so we’ll see.

The only really bad side effect so far is hot flashes/sweating, which just started in the last week or 2. And specifically my face?? I’ve always run a little warm but dear god the slightest bit of humidity or activity now and I look like I’m sweating out a fever. I’m really hoping that doesn’t stick around.

I wasn't busy, so I was happy to make another for her; I made it half strength and put the extra shot on the side in case she wanted it a little stronger. Later on the mum (little old lady) gave me a big thumbs up across the room and told me it was perfect and I was amazing 🤣 

I took the time to go over to their table later, and she asked me softly, ""The boy that was on the counter, is he new??"" Oh dear, haha. The only staff member who's longer serving than I am in this workplace 😂

So I explained to her very carefully how to order a half strength coffee 🤣☕️ She and her daughter both repeated it a couple of times 'half-strength, half-strength' like a mantra! It made me wonder how often she buys coffee at all?

Some people... this was a lovely old lady, and I do like her and her daughter, but goodness... life of a barista, huh? This kind of thing happens to me every day 😂

1o0p71o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0p71o,Open living and dining area remodel,"I am currently remodelling our living, dining and kitchen area. I want to achieve a clutter free and modern, not too dark but still cozy space.

I have prompted Nano Banana quite a bit to visualize my ideas on how to setup the living area based on actual photos of the area. In the pictures you can see:

* AI enhanced design idea for living area with different carpets
* Photo of the living area in its current state of the remodel
* AI enhanced design of the living and dining area

I'd like to think that I have a good general idea of what might work for us in the living area and I am set on some of the furniture that we already have (sofa, tv console, dining table, fireplace, dining area rug) but am unsure of some specific choices. Also I am unsure on how the design ties together throughout the open space areas.

Some constraints are:

* The area only has windows on the north-west / north side of the house so the bright, soft daylight situation in the AI generated pictures is a little too optimistic.
* We currently do not plan to change the floors for now. (Yes, I know...)

My questions are:

* What rug to choose? The options shown are carpets actually available in a fitting size. Options at 280cm width are a bit limited. A standard 300x400cm is to wide and would interfere with the steel plate under the fireplace. If it design-wise was the perfect match, I could maybe look into having a rug shortened.
* Black or white marble coffee table? Or something completely different?
* How to use the area in front of the livingroom windows? I was thinking something like an Eames Lounge Chair?
* What could be improved in terms of lighting? Especially, what could I do to achieve that in general brighter, soft lighting during the day? Recessed lighting in the ceiling is not an option due to the concrete ceilings, I tried track lights with spots but they seem to clutter the rooms aesthetic. Also I cannot decide between black or white tracks and spots and where to place them.
* Do you have any other suggestions or ideas for the area that I could use in my design process?

Getting familiar with Norm as a stand-up comic happened after he died. A goofball on snl that was relegated to late night alt shows. That's what i thought! I did not know his roots or his prowess in standup, nor how bad he rubbed some people the wrong way. These days i'm a little embarrassed to admit i probably listen/watch Janice once every couple weeks. For me its a masterpiece. A moonlight sonata of haha. It couldn't be delivered more off-handed and contemplatively, as though he's thinking a lot of it up on the spot. The twists and turns it take are simultaneously formidable and silly. The punchline is morbidly hilarious and rewarding, but has a joke in total ever been this much more than its punchline? Norm, and certainly this joke, aren't for everyone. Norm definitely seemed to channel some of his issues with women into his comedy - but i'm not about to try to pin anything down there. My wife hated it the first time she heard it ""the way he says lady curdles my blood!"" (he says it a lot in this joke)... and it took me several listens to fall in love with it.

After dropping my eldest at nursery, my MIL was coming to get my youngest for a few hours. The first solo morning I’ve had in agessss. I had a whole morning planned full of fun activities. Coffee in peace and quiet, a shower without little hands trying to grab at me, and building my daughter’s bed! 

At 7.30 am I got a text from my partner telling me some plumbers were coming to give us a quote on finishing our bathroom. So I dropped off my daughter, sent my son off, and made myself a coffee before they arrived. I was expecting them to be half an hour max, but then they started laying tarp and bringing in their tools. This is when I realized they were here to actually do the job. At that exact moment my stomach also decided it wanted to do its thing. 

I tried to distract myself, stay busy, tried folding laundry, but the twisting and turning in my stomach only got worse. By this time an hour had elapsed. Mortified about having to ask the plumbers to use the bathroom, I continued to persist. After 2 hours, I was in real bad shape. I was contemplating taking a bucket to our shed but remembered it was a mess in there. So I went upstairs to ask how much longer they would be. When they said 
“maybe an hour but probably more”, I knew I had to make a plan. Then I suddenly remembered I still had the keys to our old place about 5 minutes away, which we’re meant to give in tomorrow. I excused myself and grabbed wipes and a diaper bag (to put the wipes in because they aren’t flushable) still too embarrassed to even grab toilet paper, and ran to my car. I drove as fast as I could in agony and barely made in through the door. Then, as the title suggests, I labored for a good 10 minutes.

1o0oyj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1o0oyj0/does_ykm_ag3_lr41_button_battery_pack_deliver/,Does YKM AG3 LR41 Button Battery Pack Deliver Reliable Performance Review,"Testing out the **YKM AG3 LR41 Button Batteries** has been a rather enlightening experience. I’ve always found searching for reliable and long-lasting button cell batteries to be frustrating, especially with so many options out there that either drain too quickly or are less compatible with various devices. Trust me when I say I've tried them all—thermometers refusing to power on, wristwatches ticking slower than my morning coffee routine. The **AG3 LR41** batteries seemed promising based on the packaging and specifications, so I gave them a go. Spoiler alert: they didn’t disappoint, but they also have their quirks.

**Compact and Practical Build**  
The small size of the AG3 LR41 batteries makes them an essential part of portable device upkeep. These are incredibly lightweight, measuring just 0.51 x 0.15 x 0.05 inches, and their compact build allows them to fit into even the tiniest gadgets. From my kids’ favorite laser pointer toys to my watch that tends to die just before an event—these batteries slid right in without any hassle. The protective blister packaging was also a bonus, as it made removing individual batteries a breeze (unlike some packs I’ve wrestled with in the past where the batteries practically tried to escape like they were being interrogated).

**Safety Features and Peace of Mind**  
As someone who actively avoids products containing hazardous materials, learning that these batteries are free from chromium, lead, and mercury made me feel a little more responsible. The batteries are CE ROHS certified and go through strict quality testing, so I didn’t feel that paranoid fear of accidentally handing over something unsafe to my gadget-loving children. Leak-proof and explosion-proof are words that immediately stand out on the packaging—considering how I once had a button battery leak inside my thermometer (major hassle), this layer of security was much appreciated.

**UPSIDE**  
- The batteries offer admirable longevity due to high-quality A+ battery cells.  
- The 3-year shelf life ensures you have reliable stock for emergencies.  
- Compatible with a bunch of gadgets, including thermometers, flashlights, watches, and lasers.  
- Protective packaging helps prevent damage during storage or transport.

**Performance in Real-World Use**  
Once the batteries were set up in my thermometer, I noticed no lag or delay in performance; the device powered on seamlessly. After a week or so of use in a Christmas light remote, they hadn’t shown any major depletion even with constant presses. When used in my daughter’s somersaulting toy, the AG3 LR41 didn’t let me down anytime soon, maintaining power for hours. Additionally, the voltage consistency impressed me because even with weightier tasks, they didn’t stutter or dim.

However, keep in mind that the real stress-test comes when you stretch their usage further. I did notice that under devices requiring continuous functionality, such as hearing aids or digital calipers, their lifespan, though good, wasn’t head and shoulders above the competition. They hold their ground with stable, reliable output, but for extremely high-demand products, I might look elsewhere.

**Compatibility Across a Vast Range of Devices**  
As someone who always seems to have three different gadgets failing at the same time, versatility is a big deal. These batteries boast an impressive range of compatible models such as L736, LR736, SR41, and many more that fit my more obscure electronics. They're a go-to for everything from hearing aids to auto keys, which honestly makes life easier. My thermometer, remote key, and even an ancient children’s soundbook all worked perfectly with these batteries.

**CAVEATS**  
- Continuous use in high-drain devices can cause quicker depletion.  
- Sizes may confuse buyers who are unfamiliar with compatible model labels.  
- Packaging design, while functional, doesn’t scream premium quality.  
- Not the cheapest option if you're strictly budget-focused.  

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing these with alternatives like Energizer’s button cells or Duracell’s equivalent models—which I’ve used in the past—both competitors tend to shine when durability is concerned. Energizer has an edge with even longer life spans under demanding conditions, while Duracell batteries often come with slightly more robust packaging and better recognition. However, the AG3 LR41 has a significant perk: affordability and ease of availability. Unlike competitors with inconsistent stock, this product has made life significantly easier for day-to-day functionality. On another note, the safety-focused design of YKM's batteries is slightly better than some no-name brands I've tried that literally sparked (in a bad way).

**Quality for Price**  
The value for money here is solid if you’re looking for dependable, everyday batteries for smaller tools and gadgets. Though slightly pricier than unanimously cheap brands, the trade-off for reliability and fewer device mishaps makes it worthwhile. I mean, you're effectively paying for peace of mind when you KNOW the batteries won’t fail right in the middle of a task critical to your sanity—like fixing a crying child’s lifeless toy.

I'm 18(M) years old, in college, and taken - facts which obviously make me the harbinger of everything wise and holy in the eyes of the frequenters of this sub... duh. I used to use this sub (and reddit as a whole) when I was younger (13-15), and scrolling through this subreddit.... not a lot has changed.

I was taking a shower when I remembered this subreddit existed, and I figured I'd make a small advice post for people who were maybe struggling in high school with relationships a bit. I'm no master at it, but I figure I'd ease some concerns :) 

The big rule of thumb is you need to take care of yourselves. Men aren't looking for pornography-level proportions in a lady, and girls aren't looking for broccoli-cut buff alpha males. C'mon, guys. 

This post is mostly for guys... as I'm a guy and know what it's like to be a dude in high school. 

As said previously... you have to take care of yourself. I'm not saying you have to be ridiculously self-oriented, but you have to do things for your own benefit. Go to the gym to keep yourself in shape, eat healthy, drink plenty of water (whatever you think you're drinking isn't enough), and for the love of god find a hobby. 

Don't do things because some roid-abusing dude with short hair told you to, or some buff high school student told you... the internet is biased towards farming your insecurities because it makes you spend more time online. Get offline. Moderate your usage of Discord, Reddit, Youtube, and spend time tending to the real you. 

People are attracted to those who are self-sufficient. Don't spend all your time in your room. Take walks, join a club, frequent a coffee shop. Do things you WANT to do. Don't read The Art Of War to brag to girls in your class about how you read it. Don't pretend to be better than your peers. You're not an alpha male, you're a plant that needs sunshine and TLC. Be nice to people. Assholes (the people.) are the #1 turn off regardless of gender. 

Social anxiety's a bitch. I've been there! I'm on two antidepressants, and have been in therapy for a while... improving mental problems is hard because you're at war with yourself. The only thing you can do is push yourself forward little by little: your brain has designed your social anxiety and depression to be comforting, in the sense that you never go to war with it - you're being tricked into staying inside your bubble. It's simple to break out of it, but it isn't easy! It takes time, and most importantly, setting yourself up for good things.... treating your body with care, your brain with care, your education with care... and your heart with care! 

Ask them out - the worst that you get is a no, or maybe even a mean comment. All that means is that they treated you terribly. If somebody who you didn't dig asked you out, would you be mean about it? Nah. Be better! If they put you down, they aren't for you. 

Make friends - it's hard, but you can't make friends if you aren't looking for them. New classes and situations are always prime areas for that. Clubs, dances, and so on... find excuses to talk to people. I promise they don't bite :) 

And when you are in a relationship... be honest. 9 times outta ten, your partner's on the same page as you. Be open! Being closed off only creates problems. Communicating a hard thing one time is better than hiding it a million times. You love eachother! Treat yourself the same way you'd treat your partner. 

That's not to say you should ""over-reward"" yourself, but you should care for yourself, and be realistic (without being a lame doomerist) about your situation. It's high school. C'mon. Do what you can! It's all about balance: you don't need to cure cancer to find love, but you definitely don't need to be a cookie cutter guy. Be yourself, find your passion outside of gaming, preferably creative, maybe start exfoliating and moisturizing, cut back on sugar, and hold your chin up a little higher. 

Sorry for the ramble... I hope this helps at least some of you :) 

Take care, and treat yourself well!

I love in Michigan and with fall here. I know how tough and lonely breakup can feel especially when the weather starts to cool down.

We became super close over a few months. We weren't friends, our interactions were always defined more as romantic/sexual tension.  

So there is an age gap here, not only that I sensed back then she was highly immature. I asked her out to coffee and I don't know what happened but she pulled the I have a boyfriend card. 

After that I didn't push just quietly walked away and detached. I thought summer apart would have gotten rid of her feelings but we returned to campus and we are sharing a class again

She tried to act like nothing had happened between us, tried to flirt again like she did last time and I shut it down, not coldly but made it clear that while I'm interested I wasn't into this whole ambiguity. She knows the ball is in her court but since then she has gone from avoiding me to moving closer but still expecting me to make the first move again. 

I was thinking of breaking the ice but haven't yet gone through with it

This is where her friend comes in. They used to sit together but her friend for past two weeks has been stealing glances during class, which I've noticed. The last class in a lecture hall of 300 seats she sat right beside me when there are only 80 students. I could tell it was deliberate and she seemed eager to get my attention.

So the other girl Ashley, the one from last semester she noticed it end of class that her friend was sitting next to me and didn't seem happy at all. 

Both girls walked past each other later and acted like they didn't know each other. I know Ashley's told her other friends about what happened between us, so I assume this girl knows too but doesn't seem to care.

I'll be honest I think her friend is cute, and I'd love to see where things could go but things between Ash and I are still unresolved and this seems like a situation that could end up in a mess

1o0oshd,https://i.redd.it/jhjnvey3pqtf1.png,My freemium caffeine tracker isn't converting. Is the free tier too good? Seeking advice: more paywall vs. ads?,"Hey r/iosdev,

Looking for some advice on a classic indie dev dilemma. I'm a solo dev and recently launched an app called **Mindful Coffee** ([find it here on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindful-coffee-tracks-caffeine/id6742878005?platform=iphone)).

It's a caffeine tracker with a twist: besides logging drinks, it models your daily cortisol rhythm (based on some cool chronobiology research) to help you optimize *when* to drink caffeine for better energy and sleep.

My original plan was a pretty standard freemium model: let people use the core logging features for free, and if they dig the concept, they can unlock the advanced cortisol modeling and personalization with a Pro subscription.

The problem is, judging by the numbers and some user feedback, the free version seems to be *good enough* for a lot of users. The conversion rate to Pro isn't what I'd hoped for.

So, I'm at a crossroads and would love your collective wisdom. Do I:

1. **Get more aggressive with the paywall?** Maybe move another ""nice-to-have"" feature, like detailed sleep correlation stats, to the Pro tier to create a stronger incentive to upgrade.
2. **Introduce ads?** I'm hesitant because I really value a clean UI, but a simple banner ad at the bottom of the free version is a potential revenue stream. Or going fancy with interstitial ads?
3. **Something else entirely?** Maybe I'm missing another angle.

The app is still quite young, so on that note, I'm also wide open to any general feedback you might have on the concept, UI, or anything else.

Hey there,

I’m looking to connect with someone genuine who enjoys good conversation, laughter, and building a real connection. Friendship is always the starting point, but I’m open to seeing where things can naturally go whether that’s just good company, something casual, or eventually more.

A little about me: I’m 33, 5’10”, athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. People would describe me as laid back, sarcastic in the best way, and always down to laugh. My work keeps me busy with odd hours, but I actually enjoy the flexibility it gives me. I can travel and usually work around different schedules pretty easily.

When it comes to interests, I’m all about the outdoors during spring, summer, and fall whether that’s hiking, camping, being out on the water, or just a long walk with good company. In the colder months I switch gears and keep it cozy with reading, cooking, binging shows, or relaxing with coffee and good conversation. I also really value physical connection and quality time. It’s my way of feeling close to someone.

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s fun, witty, playful, and open minded. Consistency matters to me, and I’d love to find someone who enjoys both the silly side of things and the deeper conversations. Someone who’s not afraid of a little sarcasm, loves to laugh, and appreciates genuine connections.

If this sounds like your vibe, send me a message. I’d be glad to get to know you.

That could change in the next 2-5 years, but for the sake of not wasting anyone’s time, that’s not the objective of this post. 

I am, however, looking for some real estate career advice/guidance from anyone willing to be generous with their insight.

As some background, I was slated to come onboard and work with the agent who helped us buy our house. This was initiated by **their** encouragement and driven by my sincere interest in pursuing the career path under this person’s mentorship. I completed the WY RE courses and passed the licensing test in early 2023… when the agent all but ghosted me shortly thereafter (no falling out or anything, but I think they were working through some personal health struggles and lost focus on this idea). I hadn’t been prepared for this outcome and before it was too late, I wasn’t aware that I could put the license on hold with the state while interviewing other brokers on my own. So, I sadly let it lapse. *As a side note, I have seen that this agent has switched brokers 4 or 5 times since 2022, so no hard feelings - I feel that I may have dodged a bullet on that one.* 

I’m left now in late 2025 transitioning out of my 9-5 career and considering a few options for next steps while still feeling drawn to the real estate sales industry.

To approach this all again in a better way, and a little more cautiously, I have a few burning questions… 

Cheyenne realtors:

1. Do you feel that Cheyenne/Laramie County is a good area to pursue this career path? In other words, is there a seat at the table for me, or is real estate currently saturated for agents here? Could it be a good idea to pursue the CO license early on as well… or does it seem Cheyenne has enough business for a new agent to stay focused solely on this area for the first year or two before pursuing additional licensing in other states? I know inventory is spiking up, but have no idea if agent workload remains sizable or if there’s still a fair amount of buyer interest here.

2. Your opinion on best broker(s) for first time agents, and why? I’ve done a little of my own research and have a Re/Max agent in the family in another state, but would appreciate some local insight.

3. Opinions on starting off full time as an agent vs. working a more stable income and working as a part time agent until a solid client base is developed? 
*Obviously this can be subjective to a person’s own goals, life circumstances, and needs - I’m just trying to consider all reasonable factors.* 

4. Is there a decent chance I could find a realtor willing to sit down over coffee if I start reaching out, or is there a veil of competitiveness that makes honest advice hard to come by?

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve. I'm pretty lowkey and keep it real.

**A Bit About Me**

* I'm a good listener, and I appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter
* I like calm company—hanging in a voice call while we each do our own thing is underrated
* I'm into solo hobbies, but always open to trying something new if someone brings the spark
* I'm the type who loves to listen and be there for people, but I'll give advice if I can help. Sometimes just being present for someone is what matters most

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I'm not looking for a big group or server—just hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing—I'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM—I'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest—most of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats—mostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style—and I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way—I'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives—conspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content (the drone situation and things like 3I/ATLAS have been super interesting to follow lately). I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies—I'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now—mostly desk work—but I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night—just watching the lightning and chilling—that hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

I used to have a rat and a goldfish, but sadly they passed ages ago. I don't have pets right now because I want to make sure I can give them the love and attention they deserve when the time is right.

And hey, if none of this resonates with you, that's totally fine. I'm always looking to try new things and pick up new interests.

I'm mainly looking for genuine connections and friendships first, but I'm open to seeing where things go naturally if we really click. No pressure, no expectations.

If you're also craving something a little more real than surface-level chats, maybe we're on the same wavelength. Send me a DM or message—timezone differences don't bother me (as long as they're not too extreme), so reach out anytime!",1,1759865177.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I'm not an antisocial person, not even introverted; actually I'm really outgoing and I love talking to people.

When I was a child I was extremely bullied and isolated, it all came from the fact that I'm gifted (I think that's the correct term, I'm not an English speaker) therefore I have always been quite different from the people my age. I had to leave school for a while.

It took many years but I overcome the trauma and became extroverted and friendly, I had many friends over the years.

Two years ago, I started art school and got bullied again, I wasn't able to fight back and was so depressed that I left school again and stopped talking to everyone, that's how I lost all of my friends, slowly.

This year I came back to finish my last year with a new class. They are all very kind, but all of them have their friend groups and they aren't very interested in forming deep connections. I have taken the iniciative to make plans, but it didn't lead to much. They are very kind, but just casual classmates.


I was doing good until now that I got quite sick and I've been in bed, without anything to do for a few days. I feel so terribly isolated and lonely. I know this is just temporary but it's so hard. I need friends. I need people to have a coffee and chat. I need people to take a walk and share different opinions. I need to go out and party, or go to the park, or the mall, or anything.
I just need a friend. I crave a friend group.

I'm not sure of what to do. I'm in my last year and don't have the time to find activities in my area, not that there's much to do here anyway.
I'm not into videogames nor do I have a computer of my own.

I have spent the last few days in bed, only dumb scrolling through Reddit and Instagram for many, many hours.

This will be my first time in Romania as I've never been past Budapest before. Work in Timisoara is done on 7 Nov, I fly out of Bucharest on 18 Nov (6AM, so that day is lost), leaves me 10 full days (starting the 8th) to plot my way back to Bucharest and wanted to know what people thought of my options. 

FWIW, I (55M) love train travel and wasn't planning on renting a car (in 30+ years of traveling, I've rented a car overseas exactly 2x), but it looks like I'll be missing a lot w/o one, so I made a couple of options. Also, I'm mostly into (local) food, nature, hiking, architecture, art, history, stuff like that. I love good coffee and cocktails too, beer & wine to a lesser degree, but otherwise am not interested in nightlife. Budget isn't a huge issue.

**Option 1**, taking trains (CFR) along the following route: Timisoara > Cluj-Napoca (2 nights) > Sibiu (2 nights) > Brasov (3 nights) > Bucharest (3 nights). Total travel time is almost 22 hrs, including changes, but also w/o delays. Again, I quite enjoy this sort of slow travel, but this route goes past places like Corvin's Castle that I'd miss w/o hiring a car/joining a tour from like Sibiu and tracking back a ways. Total cost, going 1st when I can, 2nd otherwise, is about $74 USD.

**Option 2**, renting a car. New route would be something like: Timisoara > Deva (Corvin's Castle) > Clus-Napoca (2 nights?) > Sighisoara > Viscri > Sibiu (2 nights? 1 if staying a night at a previous stop) > Brasov (3 nights) > Bucharest (3 nights). Total cost is about $340 for 7 days (return 1st thing in Bucharest) through my company's rental discount + gas. I can keep it longer, shorten my stay in Bucharest too, but I can't see a need for a car in Bucharest. There's also the Transfagarasan Highway, but it may be closed in November--will dedicate 1/2 a day bet. Sibiu and Brasov if still open. And of course, with a car, I can just stop anywhere I like, take detours, etc., since there are plenty of places I haven't listed above that I may want to stop by.

(**Option 2A** is to drive west or south, hit Belgrade and/or Sofia, ignore Transylvania altogether except a bit at the end, maybe a day trip to Brasov before ending up in Bucharest. I really want to head down to Sofia, but I'll probably save that for a whole separate trip.)

Anyway, I wanted to see if anyone had thoughts, and other places I may be missing (I've done quite a bit of research on the area on Reddit and elsewhere to pick out what I've already picked out). Thanks!",1,1759864819.0,travel,1,1.0,False

Snow drifted lazily over Grimmauld Place, settling on every crooked tile and chimney.
Inside, chaos reigned.

The Blacks’ home looked like Christmas had exploded in technicolor.
Tinsel floated. Fireplaces roared. Someone (probably Lyra) had bewitched the ornaments to sing off-key versions of Weasley Is Our King.

“Technically,” Sirius announced proudly, wand in hand, “this is festive innovation.”
Isabel, holding a tray of biscuits, raised an eyebrow. “It’s also a public safety hazard.”
Remus, passing through, murmured, “Both statements are true.”

The tree wobbled dangerously.
“Dad!” Lyra yelled. “The angel’s possessed again!”
“That’s family tradition,” Sirius replied.
“The tradition is trauma,” Elara corrected, rescuing the angel with a calm finite incantatem.

From the kitchen came Molly Weasley’s voice:
“IF ANYONE SETS OFF ANOTHER FIREWORK INDOORS, I’M CONFISCATING WANDS UNTIL NEW YEAR!”

Everyone froze. Even the portrait of Walburga went quiet.

⸻

🎁 Warmth and Whispers

By evening, the house smelled of pine, cinnamon, and something vaguely burnt (Sirius’s attempt at cookies).
Remus and Tonks helped decorate while the kids played Wizard Charades.

“Two words,” Ron guessed. “First word—angry?”
Harry flapped his arms dramatically.
“Dragon?”
“NO!” Lyra shouted. “It’s Snape before coffee!”

The entire room erupted in laughter—until a soft knock came at the door.

Isabel opened it to find Dumbledore, snow on his shoulders, eyes somber.
“Forgive the intrusion,” he said gently, “but there’s been… movement.”

⸻

🕯️ The News from Azkaban

The laughter faded as they gathered in the sitting room.
The fire flickered, casting gold light on anxious faces.

“Azkaban,” Dumbledore began, “has fallen eerily quiet. The guards report an absence—a void where screams used to be.”
Remus frowned. “An escape?”
“Several, perhaps,” Dumbledore said. “But one name carries weight above all others.”

Isabel’s fingers tightened around her teacup. “Bellatrix.”

Sirius exhaled slowly, running a hand through his hair. “My cousin.”

The children looked at him in silent shock.
Elara spoke first, voice soft. “What… did she do?”

Sirius hesitated, eyes dark with memory. “Bellatrix was brilliant once. Charming. Fierce. The sort of witch who could make an entire room listen when she spoke. But she loved the wrong cause.”

Lyra frowned. “Voldemort.”
He nodded. “Completely. She thought cruelty was strength. She tortured people who fought back—people who wouldn’t break.”

Harry’s voice was small. “The Longbottoms?”

Sirius looked at him sadly. “Yes. Your parents’ friends. Alice and Frank. Two of the bravest Aurors I ever knew.”
He stared into the fire. “Bellatrix and a few others attacked them after the war—trying to make them reveal where Voldemort had gone. They never gave in. But…”

Isabel reached for his hand. “They didn’t survive it the same way,” she finished quietly.
Sirius swallowed hard. “She laughed through it. Said she was purifying the world. She called me a traitor for loving your mother,” he said, glancing at Isabel. “And she meant it.”

The room was silent except for the crackling of the fire.

⸻

🪄 Light After Darkness

Elara was the first to move. She knelt beside her father, placing a hand on his arm.
“You’re nothing like her.”
Sirius smiled faintly. “I try not to be.”
Lyra added softly, “You’re what a real Black should be.”

That broke the heaviness. Isabel leaned forward, cupping Sirius’s face, her voice steady.
“Bellatrix might carry the bloodline, but we carry the legacy. We chose love.”
He chuckled hoarsely. “Always knew I married the poetic one.”
She grinned. “And the patient one.”

Remus raised his cup. “To the ones who broke the cycle.”
Harry lifted his, too. “To the ones who made it home.”

⸻

❄️ The Snow Returns

By the next morning, the house was alive again.
Laughter bounced off the walls.
Lyra had bewitched snowflakes to fall inside the kitchen (“climate enrichment!”), and Harry was testing a new broom in the backyard.

Isabel caught Sirius watching from the window.
“You okay?” she asked softly.
He nodded. “Just thinking. For every person like Bellatrix, there’s another who stood against her. That’s what I want them to remember.”
She kissed his cheek. “Then tell them. And keep telling them until it becomes truth.”

He smiled. “You always know how to fix me.”
“That’s because you’re very repairable.”

⸻

🎄 Epilogue – Hope Under Snow

That night, when the fire dimmed and the children finally slept, Sirius stood by Regulus’s portrait.

“She’s out,” he murmured. “Bellatrix.”
Regulus’s painted eyes were grave. “Then history turns its circle again.”
“Not this time,” Sirius said quietly. “We’ve learned.”

Regulus smiled faintly. “Then let her try. The stars are brighter now.”

Outside, snow fell heavier, wrapping Grimmauld Place in silver light.
Inside, Isabel curled beside Sirius, whispering,
“Whatever comes, we face it together.”

And upstairs, Harry and the twins dreamed of laughter and flying and light—
unaware that somewhere beyond the sea, a woman with wild eyes and a cracked heart was already whispering vengeance.

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now—mostly desk work—but I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night—just watching the lightning and chilling—that hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

I used to have a rat and a goldfish, but sadly they passed ages ago. I don't have pets right now because I want to make sure I can give them the love and attention they deserve when the time is right.

And hey, if none of this resonates with you, that's totally fine. I'm always looking to try new things and pick up new interests.

1o0obc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1o0obc8/this_is_a_complete_mess_im_sorry_my_story_i_guess/,"This is a complete mess, I'm sorry. My story I guess. 30m/25f","Roughly 6-7 months ago I met a woman on Facebook dating. She lived in Florida and I lived in Pennsylvania. We matched and she gave me her Discord. I didn't give her attention immediately but as soon as I did we were actually getting along pretty well. She was living with her grandparents and it seemed like hell for her. She told me that he would make her go to Christian parties and want her to talk to these older men there, socialize I guess. She was worried that they would cut off the internet and we wouldn't be able to talk. I spent 400$ and got her a phone and also paid for her phone bill so that we can never lose contact. I even organized it completely and gave her all her favorite music. I sent it to her and she got it. We would sleep on calls almost every night. She had a laptop and she got me into playing Dead By Daylight with her. Some things started seeming a bit strange around this point, like she would accuse me of not doing what she says or doing the right thing in the game and she would get mad with me. I was just happy to be playing with her. One day I tried telling her about the games I was into such as Persona, a turn based RPG series with anime influences. She liked anime so I thought she would like it. We had a huge argument somehow about the dating mechanics in the game (which are incredibly minimal) and she told me that she didn't want me talking to these characters who weren't real and have them stealing attention away from her. I brought up how she liked Baldurs Gate 3 and that the dating mechanics in that game are way more substantial. I got angry about it, and she went on a frenzy saying she really feels like killing herself. I attempted to calm her down and went on a video chat with her, and I was successful. I apologized for my part. One time I screamed at her at the top of my lungs because nothing I said was getting through to her at all and I can't remember what it was about, but it was related to Pokemon Go. She said something to me in response like ""at least you cared enough to yell at me"".

  
Either way we still loved each other. She would tell me that I'm the hottest guy she has ever seen, and playfully text 'marry me'. I felt like I had to save her from her whole situation with her grandparents. I told her that I was going to come get her in 3 months (this was around the 2-3 month mark with her online.) I made a real plan for it, and I told my parents what I was doing. I guess they didn't really deny me but at the same time I told them so they knew about everything going on. I recall her saying something one time saying she had to lie to get by and that she doesn't think she can stop. I never really thought about this again. She also told me her mother was abusive and told me her step dad and her sister held her down one time to put Jalapenos in her eyes, which her mother helped with. It made me feel furious and I really felt for her. 

She made friends with a woman there at the church her and her grandparents went to. Then one day she told me she got kicked out by her grandparents and that she was coming to live with me. I was excited but also had a lot of anxiety because I knew my parents wouldn't like this. She used her church friend to take money out of a Wells Fargo account apparently and she took a greyhound bus up here. I told my parents the situation, got into arguments with them, and then one night at 1am I went to go pick her up. It was surreal. She was the last person to come out of the bus and she just seemed clueless. I walked up to her and hugged her and took her to my car. It really just felt unreal and I told her that. 

We got to my house and my dad told her we would talk later. We had sex I believe that night, and right after I was telling her all about some healthy stuff I like to do like meditation. We tried meditating together and she told me that tears were running down her eyes and she didn't know why. For the next couple days she came with me to work because I was never able to sit down together with my parents about it all yet. Then we finally did, and they welcomed her, hugged her. The first month was amazing. We always held hands wherever we went. She would playfully ""meow"" all the time. She was very odd in an endearing kind of way. I want to say she was kind of childish, and I even brought that up quite a few times. I felt bad about it though. She walked around with her mouth open and I told her she should try to keep it closed because it's healthier. I felt bad about that too and stopped saying it. We went to so many places together and had a really good time. I bought a bigger bed for us, a bigger fridge. I would buy her everything she wanted. Things, food. She was looking for jobs intensely and she eventually found one at Dollar tree.

One time when we were at the salvation army, I told her she can pick out some clothes and I would buy them. She picked some out, and I guess I didn't really like one of the clothes she picked and I hung it back up. She immediately left back to my car and we were both in silence. I felt bad. I drove to Wendies and got a coffee and asked if she wanted anything. She said no. Then I went to the grocery store and asked if she wanted anything and she told me she just wanted to go home. When I came back in the car, she almost immediately started screaming and crying very loud and I was caught off guard. On the drive back we were still arguing and I said ""so this is why your grandparents kicked you out"", she then takes my coffee and spills it everywhere, throws her belongings out of the window, and screams to let her out. So I stopped and she ran out into the woods. I went out to go get her but she was kind of mumbling to herself and just kept going. I didn't know what to do. People drove by and asked if I was abusing her. She eventually came back and said she would pack her things and leave. She packed her things and I tried to scare her out of worry saying ""where are you going to go, someone might rape and kill you"". She didn't care and left. She came back almost immediately crying, saying she forgot her glasses. My dad was outside and he caught us and we all had a chat. I was wrong for not getting her cheap clothes because she essentially came with nothing (i really do feel bad about this but we would go back and I'd get her whatever she wanted). But she was wrong for acting out that way. That same night we talked to each other. She really seemed like she felt bad and she understood it was over the top. We hugged intensely and made up. 

We would continue to hold hands everywhere. I'd get her every single thing she wanted and didn't really deny her anything. We started having arguments about very trivial shit and honestly I believe half of it was my fault. I tried to push more communication, but it was very difficult to have an adult conversation with her. I noticed that she never took accountability for anything, and I told her that over and over. Eventually I just felt like everything was a me problem and I felt so bad about everything. Just a note, there were a lot of things I handled poorly, but looking back I don't think everything was my fault. I really tried. I stopped going to therapy very early on in the start of our real life relationship. I should have kept going. I let her play video games on my PC all the time. We watched a lot of stuff together. We cuddled and laid on each other and did playful things like that. She would kiss me a bunch all over my body. Randomly say she loves me and stuff like that. Whenever I tried to kiss her for a longer period of time she would pull away. We had a good amount of sex but I felt like it could have improved over time. 

One day I texted her at work about something I was excited about. She didn't reply to anything I said and just said ""cute"" to the picture I sent last. I was disappointed in her reply and asked if she was talking to someone else or something. This turned into an argument and I tried to explain my side. She said ""I'll see you when you get home"". Then she asked if I had work tomorrow, and I said ""yeah, why?"" She said ""who cares."" She told me she was at a bar with a friend she made from dollar tree because of stress. She said it was a woman but wouldn't let me see them. We talked about the whole texting thing while I was at work, and I genuinely understood my fault in that and agreed that it was overwhelming for her and I wouldn't be texting her like that from work again. She said she would get her things from her friends house later. When I went home, all of her stuff was gone. I felt emotionally numb. I went back out to smoke and dissociate. She was calling me and stuff saying where I was and I told her I'd be back home. I got home, hugged her, told her I loved her. But I felt so blank and empty. She laid on me with sadness and closeness. Tears ran from my eyes and she wiped them. I then laid up and she laid her head beside me. I walked away to eat food and ate it in the other room in the dark. I saw and heard her go up to talk to my dad and ask where I went, and she told him she was going to get the rest of her things tomorrow. She caught me and said she was going to bed. I went back in the room and as soon as she laid down I was asking her if she was leaving, and she told me she didn't say she was or wasn't and that we would talk tomorrow. I felt frustrated and kicked the bed slightly and I really couldn't sleep. The next day she gathered her clothes in her bag and went to walk to work, which was too early. She stood at the opposite end of the driveway as if she was texting someone, and I offered to drop her off. She accepted but sat in the back. I said to her ""I don't think you love me"" and she said the same thing, and I said I do. I dropped her off. Went back home and we still texted. I thought it was going well but then I said I think I'm going to call off from work because I'm feeling really bad. (I don't do this ever and I was still going to get paid for that day). She told me we will talk when I get home but if I call out then idk. I said well I did and she said she is just going to get her things then. I said fine, I'm just going to trash it. (I literally thought that all she had to get was her towel and nightwear from the bathroom because she said her stuff was at her friends house) It was a bluff, of course. But I felt so angry that she would do this. She told me that everything I bought her is hers and I can't steal any of it or she would file a police report. I made a connection here and checked a room in the house where we don't go to, and all her stuff was there. I took all her things and put it in my car, and waited for her to come. She wanted me to go to her friends house or something but I said I'm done being nice. She pulled up and this guy came out, and I said ""Is this your new boyfriend?"" and she laughed towards him. They took the stuff and I left.

I sent her a final discord message as I was leaving and said ""I hope you die"". I realize this was one of the worst things I can possibly do and tried to retract it and delete it. She blocked me on a lot of things. That drive home was the worst I have ever felt in my life. I felt everything crashing around me, no hope anymore, my life was over. We had planned to move out and everything. I cried uncontrollably and I felt like I have did everything wrong. For 3 days I texted her on things I could non-stop. She left her Steam account on my PC and I would sign in to unblock myself and text her repeatedly. I wanted to literally die. She texted my mom saying things like I was incredibly abusive towards her and everything. She wanted my mom to bring her her check from Dollar Tree (one check, she only worked there for 2 weeks). I used my moms phone to text her back all these apologies towards all the things I felt I did her wrong for. I told her things would change and certain behaviors of mine would change. I really meant everything I said because I know that there were certain things I did that weren't healthy and could possibly be considered toxic. I was very self-aware of it and I do consider myself a very self-aware person. 

She came to the house abruptly for her check with this same guy. She told me I stole her check and I was confused and so was my dad. I said it's right here, unopened. I asked if you both were dating and the guy admitted he was actually gay and just got out of a relationship with a trans something. I tried to hug her but she backed away. I said I really loved her and they left.

When she left, my parents started to reveal to me things she said to them. She would come to my parents complaining about me and even said some things like I would go on her phone and remove her contacts when that was a complete lie. She told them that I didn't want her talking to anyone in the family, and apparently when I was about to come home she would rush downstairs because she thought I would be mad she was talking to them. Most of it was just lies. 

I still kept texting her. Telling her I did so many wrong things but also telling her about the things my parents said and stuff. She texted back briefly a few times and told me that she could never come back there because my parents were half the problem, and that she needed a license and her own life, and she needed to have friends and that I wouldn't let her have any, which is a lie. I tried to explain to her the boundary of hanging out with the straight opposite sex, alone, in real life and tried to explain it was just respectful to not do things like that. She sort of half agreed about it. She says I didn't want her talking to straight men online but I told her I did not care for that at all. During those brief texts she said I could have gotten her a steam deck. She was obsessed with that thing when I first mentioned it back when we were distant. She wanted it so she can play games on her own device, valid, but it was strange how it kept being brought up especially around these times. 

One night while I was at a friends house, crying and texting her up to 2am, listening to my friend play ""The Only Cure by The Hollow"" as he fell asleep made me more emotional. She suddenly texted me back on Instagram. Saying she misses me, that she wanted to come back because I was her home. It was a long conversation and we also talked about the things that I have done that would change, which would. We had talked about getting couples therapy which we would start doing. We talked about the whole friends thing and I told her I genuinely want her to have friends (even kind of pushed her to talk to people beyond ""I like your outfit!""). I was determined. She was staying with this guy in New Jersey, so I had therapy that day, told her my plan, left my parents in the dark, and set out to drive two hours on no sleep to get her. I met the guy officially, who has mental issues of his own like DPD. He explained to me a lot of the behaviors she has and how to accept it and deal with it. I thought he was being useful. She was all over me the entire time. We chilled, he made us ribs. They were rich, and he was just one brother out of 3-4 that lived there. The father liked her but he was in Italy at the time and apparently they would let her stay there and the dad would teach her stone masonry. She wanted to come back home and we drove back home. My parents were angry but got over it. My dad said she can stay here till we get everything figured out. 

Everything went well until she messaged me while I was at work about how my dad was talking on the phone about us. I spam called my dad and told him not to do that and it made him very angry. Big mistake. Around the same time, my pwBPDs online ex texted me at work (I texted him the first time she left just to see how their relationship was) and I stupidly texted him back, asked some brief questions and that was it. Well he got back in contact with her and they were texting and she was showing me the messages. I told her I didn't like her texting him but she can do what she wants. When I got home I apologized to my dad, and I went and got her to apologize to. She didn't want to, but I tried to get her to just out of respect and she angrily phrased it as ""I'm sorry I listened to your conversation and heard all the things you said."" He was just talking to his mother and his mother asked about us and stuff. It was a case closed, and my dad accepted our apologies and we moved on.

I tried to have a real conversation with her about boundaries and everything about the ex. I told her I didn't really like her talking to him and she told me he was just a good friend that helped her with online stuff. I was starting to get over it, and then soon realized how stupid the whole thing was. She never even met the guy as he is from the UK. She should be able to talk to whoever she wants, but I guess I just felt really clingy because I just got her back. The situation was stupid and I hated that all this got brought up and my feelings got in the way. I thought everything was kind of going well, and we started to cuddle at night. She told me that she thinks I'm going to leave her someday, and that friendships last but relationships don't. I told her, well who are these online friends to you when you've never even met them? Once she heard that, she gets up and storms out into the night. I tried to get her, found her, and I just told her in bed that I wanted to be a priority. Because she would push the friend thing all the time, but I told her she can have friends. I was just trying to focus on us and our problems. idk. She went to the bathroom during the night with her iPad. She said to me that she loves me but she deserves to have friends. I texted her things like ""I feel like I can just be replaced by your friends and stuff and it hurts me when you say relationships dont last but friends do, is there anything you can tell me to make me feel better?"" She never replied to it. 

The next morning I hugged her in the bathroom and kissed her. Told her I loved her and that she is the most important thing to me. She said she loves me back. During work, I was kind of eager for her to reply to those messages still, so instead I sent her sad gifs. She replied to the one gif ""I love you"" and I sent another and she told me I promised I wouldn't text her at work. At the same time I was trying to text this guy about everything, was going to look for advice about it. She then replies and says she can't take this anymore, to never come back to his house or she will call the cops. The guy texts me that I am not allowed to come there anymore and they will get restraining orders if they see me. She left with everything again, and this was in the span of 4-5 days after having just getting her back.

I spam texted her again as much as possible, used other peoples phones. I felt like I was decaying inside because the things I said would change would, but this whole ex thing was brought up and I felt like I just made everything worse again. 3 days later, she texts me back. Says that maybe we can be together again someday but we would need to go to therapy and stuff. She then left me unblocked on one of her Discords and we chatted briefly. Talking about things and she told me some stuff that was just wildly distorted and I tried to argue against it saying ""no this is actually what happened"". I showed her the instagram stuff I posted with all of our pictures, and we both got very sad. She kept saying maybe, maybe. Told me she really loved me and that she hopes to move out with me to this place we planned to someday. The next day I asked my therapist about couples therapy, and she told me she can't do it while she is in a different state. She replied once saying ""So she can't help us either way.""

That was the last text she sent. She didn't message me roughly 2 days after while I sent her a bunch of texts on discord, some brutally honest stuff, but generally told her that I've been researching BPD heavily and that a lot of our issues seemed to have stemmed from that. She told me she had BPD and/or HPD once. But after heavily researching it, I find myself thinking this really feels like the exact type of shit I just went through. I texted my therapist about one on one therapy for her and they said they can teach DBT skills and stuff, sent her screenshots. I edited and deleted a lot of messages but in the end I tried to convince her recovery is possible and everything like that. She blocked me this morning without a word.

If you've read all of this you might be thinking that I'm just as terrible for certain things. There was a lot of shit that I definitely handled poorly, immaturely, and just was unacceptable. I really tried though. I really tried to push communication, I really tried. I love her to death. I really believe she was my soulmate. I've already read so many threads about everything having to do with BPD and it all resonates with me. This was the first real relationship I ever had. My other relationships were online only for the most part, but I still learned a lot from them. I was so ready for this in the beginning and I thought we could get through everything together. We had so many good times, but so many silly fights and I know I have progressed some. But I really truly love her. After this block, I sent her an email saying she will never have real friends, real love, that she was just a drug and she never loved me. But I love her and I hope that she will get better. I said to never contact me... I can be so mean, but truly I don't really mean it but when I think about the things she has done to me, it's like I don't know which way to take it.

Unfortunately I hope she texts me back one day. I have a lot of things to work on myself for sure, and I have taken accountability for all the wrong things I have done. But I'm decaying inside. I feel empty and my life is just hopeless now. She told me straight up she has BPD but why does she believe everyone has to just deal with it and work around it with her? She has been through a lot of places, lived in different states, she was homeless. Now what's going to happen to her? I'm still worried. But I also don't know if she truly loved me. It feels like I'm in a state of dissociation, it's almost similar to the de-personalization experience I had when I smoked weed once. I just had to get this off my chest. I don't post on reddit ever. I'm still going to go to therapy even though it's expensive. But it feels like I will never find someone like her ever again. That I'm just unlovable.  ",0,1759864596.0,BPDlovedones,3,0.5,False

I must preface this by stating I know very little about quality coffee.

My husband has requested a nice coffee maker and grinder for his birthday. I think I’ve decided on the mocchamaster KBGV. I’m open to other suggestions—we just need something relatively low maintenance that is simple to use and makes a great cup of coffee. 

Now, I am completely overwhelmed with grinders. I see the top ones to consider include the Encore ESP and the Ode 2. Like the coffee maker, I’m looking for something low maintenance that is simple to use and makes a great cup of coffee. 

Am I heading in the right direction? Should I be looking at other options? What do you all think/recommend?

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve. I'm pretty lowkey and keep it real.

**A Bit About Me**

* I'm a good listener, and I appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter
* I like calm company—hanging in a voice call while we each do our own thing is underrated
* I'm into solo hobbies, but always open to trying something new if someone brings the spark
* I'm the type who loves to listen and be there for people, but I'll give advice if I can help. Sometimes just being present for someone is what matters most

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I'm not looking for a big group or server—just hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing—I'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM—I'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest—most of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats—mostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style—and I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way—I'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives—conspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content (the drone situation and things like 3I/ATLAS have been super interesting to follow lately). I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies—I'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now—mostly desk work—but I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night—just watching the lightning and chilling—that hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

I used to have a rat and a goldfish, but sadly they passed ages ago. I don't have pets right now because I want to make sure I can give them the love and attention they deserve when the time is right.

And hey, if none of this resonates with you, that's totally fine. I'm always looking to try new things and pick up new interests.

If you're also craving something a little more real than surface-level chats, maybe we're on the same wavelength. Send me a DM or message—timezone differences don't bother me (as long as they're not too extreme), so reach out anytime!",1,1759864388.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False

Soo i am in stress lately my college entrance exams are next month 
I study atleast 10 - 12 hr in a day and I am still not getting enough results.
And then I gave a mock test today and I was really disturbed by my performance 
And seeing others doing better is really sad u k why .

And then i got into an argument with my family, friends and I was feeling worthless 

At that time I was sitting at a cafe ( came for coffee between classes) I saw someone smoking the same brand I used to smoke, just for a second i thought I should smoke for once 

But then suddenly a thought strike on my mind that what will happen if I smoke ? 
It will not resolve my problem. It will not help my studies it will just give me a bad mood later if I smoke 

And my urge to smoke died and I had my coffee went back to library and ( 🥲 i slept for 30 min ) i needed to relax. ",2,1759864350.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

I work at a very large company and have done a lot of big projects with the same people. A lot of those folks move on to other roles, other things, projects get done and life moves on. I miss working with those same people, chatting with them, knowing exactly what I was walking into each day.

I find myself sticking to routines, fairly strictly. Every 3rd day I go to the gym, every Saturday morning I have coffee with friends, every Tuesday I play trivia with the same people.

I eat a very similar lunch, every single day.

I like these routines! I do try new things here and there as I know I need to, but I can't help notice a touch of sadness as things change around me. 

I don't have kids but I'm sure that type of change has an even larger impact on folks.

Both the Sertraline and Gabapentin are well-tolerated. It is just concern because I read about cardiac issues with trimebutine. Something about ion channels like Sertraline?

I WISH I could be that kind of person, lots of type As do. But we can’t. Partly because of schedules and stuff and partly because I simply do not want to just not know until the time comes. 
I want to know whether to clean my place, I want to know whether I have time to nap, I want to know to look up the menu before. I wanna know whether I can change into my pjs or whether to block out the area and be home. 
But even when all that isn’t true, I still want to know. 
If you gotta change it later that’s fine, but you need to understand that many people out there do not want you to simply do whatever whenever.

I have a nice orbital sander with various grit discs ready to go. I'm 99% sure the top is laminate and my plan was to tape off the top in quarters and sand very very lightly with 120 until the original finish is gone and hopefully I don't blast through the veneer. 

Our thought was to use chalk paint and try to match the look of our dining set. I'd like to preserve the details in the table top of possible instead of just painting a solid colour over it. Looking for any suggestions on how to best approach this and if doing a watered down chalk paint wash on the table top would be suitable to keep the details?

1o0nozn,https://youtu.be/OtQZG5ZKWUU,Survivors: Loss - Short Film,"Hey everyone, thanks in advance to all those who take time to check out this short. Here's a little break down and submission statement:

Quick tech spec: This was shot on the Red V-Raptor in 6k HQ S35 mode with the Cooke Speed Panchro S2/3 lenses, framed for 2.2:1 aspect ratio. Every shot was performed on the Arri Trinity (shout out to my DP/Steadicam Op Chad Chamberlain). I edited and colored this is Davinci Resolve. Phantom LUTs Neutral was used as a base, and lots of other little tweaks were applied.

Budget: I spent about $3,500.00 of my own money on this project. All of my friends volunteered their time for production, but I had a coffee truck with unlimited coffee and pastries there for the day, fully catered meals, unlimited crafty, and I took everyone out after the shoot day for burgers and beer which all in was $1,250.00 for food for the one day shoot. Sound was the most expensive part as I spent $2,350.00 getting all of the foley redone at Foley First and having it professionally mixed at Apex Studios for both surround sound and 5.1.

MASSIVE shoutout to Yuri Pridachin from Foley First. Yuri did foley for every single sound bite in this short from scratch and I can't recommend working with him enough.

I'll give a lot of info below, but I'd love to answer any questions you may have about this production, or film production in general.

""Survivors"" is a little series I've been developing in many different phases for the last 15 years. It's slowly evolved into a goal of mine to create a series of short films that take place inside this world, all of them slowly giving more exposition and working as accompanying pieces to multiple larger features I'm developing. This is the second episode of the series, and each episode deals with a new person or group of people that survived a world ending event, and how they're handling their current situation. It's been really fun working this way as there's been a lot of times I've come up with a new short idea over the years that impacts the way I'm approaching the larger projects.

Ok, now for some personal stuff about this project that influenced the way I shot this. This might be pretty long so no worries if you don't read this wall of text.

Like just about everyone in the industry, 2023 really changed the trajectory of my career. Nearly 100% of my work was feature film and television, and it just evaporated towards the end of 2022. It was a scary and jarring shift, but opened my eyes in a few different ways. 2022 was so busy I literally did not have a break, but now all I had was time. It made me sit back and reflect on a lot of what I missed out on with my family over the years because of my work schedule, which was the main inspiration for this story. I spent almost all of my career spending my time making other people's stories, but this was one of the first times I felt the need to make something for myself.

Jeff, the lead actor, is dressed in my clothes and wearing my wedding ring. My son is the older child in the film. My daughter was at the monitor watching us make the b-roll and my wife was hanging out on set. I felt like I needed to find a way to combine both my work and my home life as this industry has a way of not allowing those to be combined.

I got lots of varying feedback from friends and colleagues on how it's shot which is always interesting. They ranged from ""This is perfect"" to ""Yeah this needs to be cut down by 5 minutes"". This was all great to hear as it made me sit back and really explore why I shot it the way I did. I got all sorts of comments on how to edit this down, and in the end I decided that any changes do not reflect the story I want to tell. Keeping the second to last shot a long oner conveys exactly how I felt being home during the strikes. All of the memories of my kids happened so fast, but now that there's nothing to do and my work was my identity for so long, all I can do is feel the seconds passing by and its excruciating. I'm faced with all of the birthdays and vacations I missed, and it's uncomfortable. I don't like it. But I can't change anything that happened.

Thankfully, my children and my wife are still alive and in good health. This short was a reminder to myself to appreciate my family while I have them, and that at the end of the day my identity needs to be in being a good father and husband, and is not tied to my work or lack there of.

We became super close over a few months. We weren't friends, our interactions were always defined more as romantic/sexual tension.  

So there is an age gap here, not only that I sensed back then she was highly immature. I asked her out to coffee and I don't know what happened but she pulled the I have a boyfriend card. 

After that I didn't push just quietly walked away and detached. I thought summer apart would have gotten rid of her feelings but we returned to campus and we are sharing a class again

She tried to act like nothing had happened between us, tried to flirt again like she did last time and I shut it down, not coldly but made it clear that while I'm interested I wasn't into this whole ambiguity. She knows the ball is in her court but since then she has gone from avoiding me to moving closer but still expecting me to make the first move again. 

I was thinking of breaking the ice but haven't yet gone through with it

This is where her friend comes in. They used to sit together but her friend for past two weeks has been stealing glances during class, which I've noticed. The last class in a lecture hall of 300 seats she sat right beside me when there are only 80 students. I could tell it was deliberate and she seemed eager to get my attention.

So the other girl Ashley, the one from last semester she noticed it end of class that her friend was sitting next to me and didn't seem happy at all. 

Both girls walked past each other later and acted like they didn't know each other. I know Ashley's told her other friends about what happened between us, so I assume this girl knows too but doesn't seem to care.

I'll be honest I think her friend is cute, and I'd love to see where things could go but things between Ash and I are still unresolved and this seems like a situation that could end up in a mess

In my old machine I used to use Illy ground espresso, so I’m thinking of trying those beans since I liked it ground but any suggestions are welcome!!!",1,1759863071.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Peace never lasted long at Grimmauld Place.
Mostly because Sirius Black believed peace was “boring” and should be replaced with fireworks and experimental cooking.

“Technically,” he declared, pointing at the grill, “I didn’t burn it — I transfigured it.”
Isabel crossed her arms. “Into what? Charcoal?”
“Art.”

Lyra was laughing so hard she almost fell off the porch.
Elara stirred lemonade with her wand, which started glowing.
“Um, Mum,” she said. “It’s fizzing.”
Isabel didn’t even look. “That’s what happens when you enchant sugar, darling.”
“Will it explode?”
“Fifty-fifty chance.”

From the garden, Harry and Ron were racing brooms while Ginny tried to referee.
Remus had stopped by for tea and immediately got roped into helping Sirius build a “safety perimeter.”

Tonks arrived, tripped over it, and yelled, “What’s the perimeter for?”
Sirius shrugged. “We’ll find out.”

⸻

☀️ Letters and Laughs

By mid-July, the Hogwarts letters arrived with their usual fanfare — owl droppings on toast.
Elara read hers first. “Remus Lupin, new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor!”
Sirius nearly choked on his coffee. “Moony? Teaching? I need to see this.”
Isabel smiled. “You will behave.”
He blinked. “Define behave.”

A letter from Hagrid followed, ending in three ink blots and a sketch of a chicken-dragon hybrid.
Lyra whispered, “I think it winked at me.”

⸻

🌕 A New Term, Old Faces

Back at Hogwarts, everything felt fresh — until it didn’t.
Remus’s first class was a hit.
“Defense Against the Dark Arts,” he said kindly. “No peacocks, no pyrotechnics, and absolutely no Lockhart.”
Harry whispered, “Thank Merlin.”
Lyra clapped. “Best professor ever.”

But during one evening study session, Elara noticed Hermione’s new necklace — a delicate hourglass on a chain.
“Time-Turner,” Hermione whispered. “For extra lessons.”
Lyra’s eyes widened. “Extra chaos.”

And that’s when it happened.
A curious hand, a slight nudge, and—

WHIRR.

The world spun.

⸻

⏳ The Past Unfolds

When the spinning stopped, they were still at Hogwarts — just not their Hogwarts.

The torches were brighter, the air younger.
Down the hall, laughter echoed — familiar laughter.

They followed the sound until they saw them:
The Marauders.

Sirius, James, Remus, and Peter — all young, wild, and very much alive.
Beside them, two girls walked arm in arm — Lily Evans and Isabel Fairfax.

Harry froze. “Mum.”
Elara whispered, “And yours, Lyra.”
Lyra’s mouth dropped. “She’s gorgeous. We get it from her.”

Isabel (younger, with sunlit hair and mischief in her eyes) was arguing with Sirius, who looked far too pleased with himself.
“If you cast one more spell on Snape, I swear—”
“It was educational!”
“You nearly killed him!”
“Minor detail!”

Remus stepped between them, weary. “Maybe we don’t traumatize Snape today.”
Lily rolled her eyes. “Honestly, I can’t tell who’s worse — Sirius or James.”
James grinned. “Obviously me.”

⸻

🐺 The Moon’s Secret

That night, after sneaking out (again), the kids accidentally followed young Remus out to the Whomping Willow.

Elara gasped softly. “He’s—he’s a werewolf.”
Lyra put a hand on her shoulder. “He’s Remus. That’s what matters.”

They watched from afar as James and Sirius helped him safely to the Shrieking Shack — no fear, only loyalty.
Harry’s chest ached. “They took care of him. Even then.”

When the transformation began, the moonlight flared — and Isabel appeared, wand raised, calm and fierce.
“Back inside, now!” she ordered the boys.
“You shouldn’t be here!” young Sirius said.
“Neither should you!”
“Technically, I’m always where I shouldn’t be,” he replied with a grin.

She glared. “Not funny.”
“Then why are you smiling?”
“I’m not!”
“You are!”

⸻

⚡️ The Cruel Prank

The next morning, laughter turned cold.
Snape had followed Sirius’s “hint” about the tunnel, nearly walking into a transformed Remus.

Dumbledore intervened — but the damage was done.

Young Isabel stormed into the Great Hall, fire in her eyes.
“You could have killed him, Sirius!”
“I didn’t mean—”
“You never mean it!”

Everyone froze.
Sirius looked stunned, words lost for once.
“You think being clever makes you right,” Isabel said, tears in her voice. “Grow up, before someone dies for your pride.”

And she left — robes flying, heart breaking.

Lyra whispered to Elara, “I can’t believe Mum yelled at Dad in front of the entire Hall.”
Elara blinked. “Actually, I can.”

⸻

💫 Redemption and Love

Days later, young Sirius found Isabel sitting under a willow tree.
He sat beside her silently, passing her a Chocolate Frog.
“I’m sorry,” he said softly. “You were right.”
“I usually am.”
“See, that’s the part that drives me mad.”

She laughed — just enough to make him grin.
“Promise me,” she said, serious now. “Never again. No more cruel jokes. No more pride before kindness.”
He nodded. “You have my word.”

And in that moment, the air shimmered faintly — as though the future itself had sighed in relief.

⸻

🕰️ Back to the Present

The Time-Turner glowed again, pulling the group home in a rush of wind and starlight.

They landed back in their own time, dizzy and teary-eyed.
Lyra blinked. “Did we just… witness our parents’ breakup and makeup?”
Harry laughed. “And my mum lecturing everyone.”
Elara smiled. “We saw who they really were.”

Later that evening, they told Sirius and Isabel everything.

Sirius groaned. “You saw that day?!”
Isabel smirked. “I told you I was right.”
“Thirty years later and you still—”
“—haven’t forgotten. Exactly.”

Remus choked on his tea. “Well, at least they know I’m a werewolf now.”
Lyra shrugged. “We figured it out years ago, Professor. You smell like cinnamon and moonlight.”
He blinked. “I… what?”

⸻

🌙 Epilogue — Stars Beyond Time

That night, laughter filled Grimmauld Place again.
Harry sat with the twins, recounting their adventure to a very amused Regulus portrait.

“So,” Regulus said, smiling, “you saw us when we were young?”
“You were brooding by the lake,” Lyra replied. “Even your hair looked serious.”
“Good,” he said. “Consistency matters.”

As the family gathered under the summer sky, Isabel leaned against Sirius, both of them watching the twins chase fireflies.

“You see?” she whispered. “Even time couldn’t break us.”
He kissed her temple. “Time’s terrified of you.”

And above them, the constellations shimmered — Orion, Cygnus, and two bright new stars near the heart of the sky.

“Some families,” Regulus murmured from his frame, “shine through every era.”

There were nights I read this Reddit to cheer up and get some motivation while pumping. Thanks for just being and sharing your experience.. 

It is my 7th month of pumping now. It was most of the time very demanding experience, but I’m very proud I made it so far.. From the beginning I feed my baby formula and breast milk. I’m under producing since the beginning. My baby didn’t latch… she was weak due to some health problems but she is much better now. I saw how my milk helps her with infections or skin issues. But I’m also so freaking tired as I’m pretty much alone in it. I don’t have much support as my husband travels for work a lot, so there are months when 2 weeks I’m alone with the baby 24/7. I’m just over stimulated and exhausted.. and on the other hand with 6 months mark I just started dropping number of pumps a day to 4 and now my supply is so low that I get 1-1.5 bottle based on whole day pumping sessions. There are moments where I see only 1 oz or less coming from one session…
I just wonder should I stop? Should I work on increasing supply which is really difficult with having little support? Should I just keep it as it is so I can have at least this one bottle? 
Part of me also wants to get my body back, start losing weight, drink herbs and coffee I like, take medication.. but with flu season coming I also feel extremely selfish about this decision…
I would be sad if I stay and if I let pumping go. Both directions feel kind of wrong…

I am excited to share a few small wins with you. I believed in the law of attraction for a long time primarily focusing on visualization, gratitude and scripting carrying the thought that whatever I ask will come to me. I approached the situation  from a lack mindset. 
Lately I re-read The Secret and applied some of the techniques described in the book. I also consume a lot of Neville Goddard videos.
I manifested a few small wins in the last one month which is as follows:
1) In the country I live, getting a passport without a police verification is impossible. I assumed casually that I won't have to go through the process of police verification. Other than receiving a casual call from a cop, I did not have anyone visit my place for a background police verification and I got the passport.
2) I am manifesting a new job with better pay and already got two interviews, but it didn't materialise as probably I had my doubts about it. I got these interview calls within 72 hours of assuming its fruition. 
3) I wanted to reconnect with a few old friends and again I casually assumed it. Two of my friends decided to get in touch with me again after many years of no contact. 
4) I assumed without feeling hung up on it, seeing a rainbow and although I didn't see it in the sky, I saw a beautiful picture of a rainbow on insta.
5) Manifested a few cash vouchers for shopping without even assuming consciously.

I hope my post gives you hope about the law of assumption and building up on the manifestation muscle using small wins. 

Please start with smaller manifestations, by assuming receiving a free cup of coffee, a blue butterfly or rainbow, a small gift or getting a call from a person who is not in contact with you. These wins will build your manifestation muscle and help you to believe strongly and assume without doubts. 
I would love to hear about your wins with the law of assumption.

Looking for a connection that would eventually turn into something long-term, meaningful & stable. I'd love to find someone who also likes museums, coffee shops, literary festivals, traveling, spending time out in nature, but also just spending time at home enjoying each other's presence in a low-stakes / light-hearted / silly (grateful for weird cat memes) kind of way. 

Very curious person, been known to ask a million questions. 

I'm really passionate about things that combine art, science & technology, and I spend a good chunk of my time designing things in this space for fun. 

Finished my grad degree not too long ago, work from home in tech at the moment. 

191 cm/81 kg, light brown hair & green-blue eyes.

Don't think I want to narrow down what I'm looking for too much as to miss out on something beautiful, but 20s-30s might be a good range on romantic aspirations. I will say that I do enjoy some degree of physical intimacy (I find touch beautiful, but it's somewhat, but not entirely, decoupled from desire for me) but I'm open-minded here. Nerdy is a plus. LDR as a start is fine but it would be nice to spend time together. Feel free to shoot me a message! I think long-term I would prefer to talk over Discord or Instagram though.

1o0neup,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0neup,💉 Why Sick Men Like Sabrina Carpenter (and Healthy Ones Don’t),"
Welcome back to another episode of “Pop Culture, but Make It Clinical.” Today’s patient: Sabrina Carpenter. We don’t know what’s wrong with her, but she somehow keeps getting worse. I won’t be surprised if her Halloween costume will be the DSM-5 in a miniskirt, performing eternal girlhood for an audience of men who should *probably* be in group therapy instead of the crowd. 

Sabrina Carpenter is a performance built for men who no longer exist, or at least, not in the way *she hopes*. Her entire act; the baby voice, flirty stage banter, tongue-biting winks, finger in her mouth shots; is designed for male attention. 

And yet, the *only* men who actually notice are the ones you wouldn’t want noticing you. This post about men who  like Sabrina (aka their women pre-approved by Freud 🪞)

The Male Gaze Isn’t Even Showing Up

Once upon a time, the “male-gaze pop girl” worked. Madonna, Britney, and early Katy Perry embodied fantasy: sexy, but self-aware enough that men projected onto them and women idolized them. Countless talented, beautiful, women step into the light to try on this archetype like a costume. It chews them up and spits them out *every-time* - (photos for comparison sake)

Sabrina, though, is performing for an audience that’s already emotionally checked out. And they know that. Some men are either detached by pornified overstimulation or genuinely disinterested in the infantilized flirt she’s selling. Her whole persona;half coquette, half punchline; lands in a cultural moment where the fantasy feels hollow, regurgitated, and out of touch. The result? Women consuming her ironically, while men scroll past.

She’s performing for men who don’t exist anymore; at least, **not in the way she imagines**. The coquette routine, the “oops-did-I-say-that?” grin, the toddler-meets-tequila energy… it’s a fantasy built for a pre-internet libido. Psychologically, it’s invoking regressive desire: selling innocence as seduction **to men/people who can’t handle equality.**

Healthy men evolved; sick men stayed in detention.
Her act whispers “I’ll never outgrow you.” They hear “Good, you’ll never have to try.”

The Ones Who Do Engage Are Sick!!!!

🧍‍♂️ Field Guide: The Men Who Actually Like Sabrina Carpenter

They walk among us. They drink iced coffee year-round. They all have strong opinions about microphones, “The Idol”, and what femininity *should* look like.

Here’s a quick guide to the ***sick*** men still falling for the toddler-voiced siren (in pop culture/archetypal terms of course, my specialty 🙂‍↕️)

⸻

1. The Reddit Romantic
Swears he’s a “nice guy,” but calls women “females” when no one’s listening. Thinks quoting 500 Days of Summer counts as emotional literacy/intelligence. “I just miss when girls were mysterious.” Okay, Joe Goldberg.

2. The Studio Goblin
Owns three MIDI keyboards, but zero empathy. Mixes women’s vocals at half volume because “it sounds warmer.” His flirty text is a WeTransfer link.

3. The Aesthetic Libertarian
Reads Bukowski like scripture. Thinks Sabrina’s “coquette irony” is performance art because it lets him enjoy his misogyny guilt-free. Nihilism is his love language.

4. The Recovering Frat Philosopher
Still thinks wearing a turtleneck redeems four years of hazing other people. Says “women are the real romantics” as if he invented feelings. Can quote Camus but *still* cannot locate the clitoris.

5. The TikTok Therapist
Has “healing era” in his bio but is ALWAYS 45 seconds away from crashing out SEVERELY. Explains women’s trauma back to them for engagement (he probably had a role in it). “Protect her at all costs ❤️” all while ghosting three different women named Emily; at the same time.

6. The Micro-Misogynist
Pretends to worship women but flinches when one disagrees with him. Loves confident girls, (as long as the confidence is curated and comes with a baby voice). Uses “divine feminine” to excuse his laziness. Says he’s a “provider” but provides NOTHING but HEADACHES.

7. The Irony Addict
Likes her “ironically” but follows every thirst post. Thinks self-awareness cancels out creepiness. Favorite phrase: “It’s satire.” Second favorite: “I’d wife her tho.”

8. The Lazy Boyfriend Archetype
Unshowered, unmedicated, and allergic to accountability. Calls her “genius” for whisper-singing, but his own girlfriend “just doesn’t have range” as a woman. Owns one CLEAN outfit but also fourteen God complexes.

9. The Peter Pan of Dating Apps
Thirty-one going on seventeen. Bio says “just looking for something real.” Forgets birthdays, but remembers Snapchat usernames. Likes women small enough to disappear into the ether when he’s done pretending.

10. The Comment Section Prophet
Leaves “she’s so real for this” under thirst traps while debating body counts under another post. Thinks parasocial feminism counts as allyship. His entire personality is a quote-tweet (just like Sabrina)


Healthy Men Feel the Uncanny

Well-adjusted men don’t sexualize baby talk. Their nervous systems go,

 “Wait, why is the child voice asking me to buy tequila?”

That’s called **developmental incongruence**; adult sexuality wrapped in infantilized affect. It reads like uncanny-valley femininity, not attraction. 

That’s why men with **actual emotional intelligence** gravitate toward Olivia’s sincerity/display of emotion or Chappell Roan’s non-heteronormative camp, Lana’s juxtapositions. We can go on and on. They like women who feel **human**, not animatronic. They can appreciate the many aspects of femininity, because their femininity breathes, it expresses their life source, its *alive*. 

They like women who feel real, not women who cosplay a Stepford fantasy. When they look at Sabrina, they see the machinery of performance, not a person behind it. They like/love women **not objects**.

The “Empowerment” Loop

Sabrina’s fans frame it as “owning her sexuality,” but it’s ownership without agency. If the only men you attract are broken, predatory, or ironic, you’re not in control; you’re just feeding a feedback loop. Her power exists *only* within the gaze she claims to manipulate. It’s “empowerment” in quotation marks. Her fans call it “empowerment”, but it’s textbook performative control; a coping mechanism polished into brand identity.

You perform the fantasy simply so the fantasy doesn’t kill you. People-pleasing in Prada. She says, “I’m in charge,” but the subtext screams, “Please like me before you destroy me.🥺”

The Horror of Realizing It Works

The sad part? The system rewards her anyway. Brands, media, and stan culture eat it up. She’s the perfect product: endlessly marketable and built for both consumption and denial. But offstage, there’s a void where ***genuine male affection should be***. 

The performance keeps going because the applause never stops, even if no one’s really watching. Remember all of our favorite stars who tried to fit this specific fantasy before?

The industry reinforces it with operant conditioning: each time she flirts with infantilization, the algorithm gives her another doggie treat. No wonder she calls herself “Man’s Best Friend” 🐶🦴

Cue the merch drop, cue the tour, cue another “coquette empowerment” headline. But behind the dopamine loop is identity decay; the horror of realizing the only thing keeping you visible is your own regression.

⸻

Sick men like her because she validates their sickness (her own objectification) . 

**Healthy men don’t because they see the sickness, not the siren.**

As Barbie reminds us, some people, women and men, are deeply uncomfortable with the idea of real agency. It’s easier to objectify yourself than to confront your own consciousness. When you’re an object, you don’t have to feel the terror of being human. Objects don’t fear rejection. Dolls don’t grieve. Products don’t die.

And so they paint the smile back on, crawl into the dreamhouse, and whisper:

“Goodnight, Barbies. I’m **definitely** not thinking about death anymore.”

🩷 But that’s the punchline of the gaze economy; to stay desirable, **you have to stop being alive**.

Can't stop thinking about the good times and feeling guilty, but know it's for the best. What do I do?


So, I recently had a situationship with a guy which ended because A) I had some bad feelings about him displaying immature and toxic behaviour and B) I ultimately wanted to be with someone else. 

I made a previous Reddit post about this guy (now deleted) and everyone agreed that he wasn't only displaying red flags but was being outright abusive. Some examples include pursuing me when he knew I was seeing someone else, drunken name calling/swearing, turning up at my shared work accommodation and banging on the door for ages in the middle of the night, turning up at my work in the middle of my shift after an argument, general sulkiness/passive aggression/argumentiveness etc. He's a decade older than me, previously couldn't hold a job down due to drug abuse, had abused Cocaine for decades, and was clearly still an alcoholic. 

I'm not sure if he was a legitimate Narcissist, or the behaviour was down to the narcotics abuse, or very evident undiagnosed Autism and ADHD. Whatever it was, it clearly wasn't going to work out well for me. 

The last straw was when he made up what I believe to be a very obvious lie about the other person who I'm now with, cheating on me. Not only that but he was drunk and angry, guilting me about choosing to be with this person instead of him. I believe this was a drastic attempt at manipulation-trying to get me to leave my boyfriend and go back to him. He even conveniently stayed in a hotel local to me on the night he exclaimed this lie. 
I blocked him, only sending him one message to inform him that I didn't intend on continuing the relationship in any capacity. 

Now my problem is that I can't stop thinking... What if I made a mistake? What if he didn't intend to hurt me, and he's just got no control? What if I shouldn't have blocked him and I should've talked him through it all? Surely no-one would make up such a lie, and redirect the anger at me? What if I've REALLY hurt him, and I could've been a real friend to him instead? He held me so convincingly. I didn't doubt him then. He was funny, and shared things with me from the books he read, and he seemed to genuinely care about me by bringing me coffee and medicine and bought me gifts. He apologised after arguments, once he'd sobered up. He seemed to genuinely adore me.

Also why those with worse MTF results tend to have ADD/Anxiety/OCD/Autism and how to help fix it.","I am if nothing, consistently inconsistent.

I have been criticized about this for a long time. I will come up with a theory, talk about it online, see it work for some, not for others, and eventually cast it out (or discard the broken parts) until it ends up being refined enough that it can be ""published"".

Thing is, you can basically buy your way to publications, or even just create a website where it looks like you made a formal publication, but you peer reviewed yourself. This looks official, but doesn't make you right. (Also I have 3 pubs now, one of which launched a clinical trial for a new use for a drug, so anyone thumping that I don't publish can go pound sand) 

I personally love being proven wrong, as that means I learned something new, and I can further refine my theories. My theories are never ""correct"". Not ever. They just get more precise over time and could be described as ""less wrong than they used to be"".

As I continue to pull on the transgender onion, layer after layer comes off, and I am yet shocked to find another layer underneath, the perfect gift to an autistic puzzle solver like me. The infinite puzzle onion.

I've spent the past two years pouring over whole genomic sequences from hundreds of my patients, trying to see patterns come out of the snow of data to figure out what it is exactly that makes someone have gender dysphoria, and how that specific mutation screwed up their health otherwise. (And they often do)

From that experience, I have a fairly good idea of exactly how it happens, what causes it, and what is required to generate the phenotype all the way from the most subtle dysphoria to the crippling dysphoria of the child who comes out at 4 years old. That is my primary side project at the moment, and it will be published officially in due time once we're absolutely certain its airtight. That publication has to be so incredibly accurate as people on all political sides will lose their minds over it, and the slightest error will be used to try and shred the whole thing.

Regardless, as I wandered around in the dark, I've stumbled into a few discoveries that have been helping my patients transition better, and hilariously, they harken back to my very first discovery, now almost a decade ago.

Almost 10 years ago I shot my mouth off on the internet about seeing transgender women on oral estradiol have absolutely astronomical estrone:estradiol ratios, and how when I switched these women to injections, they suddenly saw renewed progress. I theorized this was due to competitive antagonism / partial agonism.

To explain that in simple terms, imagine a high school gymnasium with 20 chairs that say "" Estrogen receptor"". You take 20 kids and put red estradiol shirts on them, and start playing musical chairs. Aside from some really odd cirumstances, when the music stops, you're almost always going to see 20 red shirts in the chairs. However, what if we added in say 20 kids wearing a shirt that says ""estrone"". These kids are deaf and blind. They can feel around for a chair, but thats it. The estradiol kids would trounce them obviously. But what if we added 200 kids? 2000 kids? At a certain point, the gymnasium is utter bedlam and hardly anyone is in a chair. This is effectively how bicalutamide works. It crowds out the androgen receptor.

So I realized then, wow, this is what's happening here. But because I was no higher than I am now, a lowly, unaffiliated family physician from Detroit, nobody cared. I had no IRB, I had no university with which to publish this theory, so I put it online.

A decade later, I am sorting through hundreds of genomes (and some cis ones too) and I just keep running into mutations in 17B-HSD1. This makes me laugh, as I saw this a decade ago in lab testing, but had no idea why. Now I realize its literally related to the development of gender dysphoria in the first place.

This enzyme converts estrone to estradiol.

Imagine you have two cities that exist on two islands near each other. Between these cities is a bridge. People work and play and live on both sides, some working on one and living on another. As a result, the bridge is always busy. Imagine on any given day, you have 6 lanes going each direction. Well, imagine if suddenly 5 of the 6 lanes from Estroneville going to Estradiolopolis are closed, but 6/6 lanes from Estradiolopolis to Estroneville stay open. Rather quickly, you're going to notice the population piling up on the side of Estroneville. You can see that in this below diagram.

https://preview.redd.it/sxs68qs48qtf1.png?width=3574&format=png&auto=webp&s=591319b3c0456c26ccead814928da615790928a5

Now, this is where I really stopped looking at it a decade ago. I figured shifting the balance back towards estrone (by avoiding 17B-HSD2 by using parenteral estrogen) I could solve this problem.

Unfortunately, that just solves one tier of it.

There is a well documented phenomenon in ""queer"" people, be they of gender or sexual orientation. Certain psychiatric conditions show up in the community more often than in the genpop.

ADD (non-hyperactive type), Generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, and Autism (anxious subtype), and when Schizophrenia is at play, the paranoid type.

Another odd thing I noticed over the years was that my skinny, anxious, flatter chested transgender women could pound down caffeine like it was nothing. I literally cannot consume a cup of coffee without being unable to sleep for 24 hours. The enzyme that metabolizes caffeine is 1A\*.

The enzyme which degrades estrone and estradiol into their ""phase 1 metabolites"" is 1A1, 1A2, and 1B1

Over a year of looking at hundreds of genomes, in the chart above, the mutations more or less sort like this.

Feminine humans (regardless of AGAB) tend to skew towards the left, towards 1A, and the weaker metabolites. They have damaged 1b1 enzymes but swift 1a enzymes. Masculine humans shift towards the right.

This is paradoxical, but the answer here is that estrogen masculinizes your brain before you are born. If you stereotypically think about lesbians, the most ""butch"" of lesbians will be rather estrogenic in appearance by comparison to femme ones. Aka Boo on Orange is the new black vs Shane on the L word.

This is why some hypermasculine dudebro with he-man gender dysphoria can go to the gym and shoot up testosterone and grow absolute honkers in the span of weeks, but I can take a castrated, feminine transgender woman and inject her with pure estradiol and she remains flatchested. How sensitive your estrogen signaling system is, and estrogenic exposure in utero determines a large portion of ""am I a boy or not"" and ""Should there be a penis here, am I a top?"".

Basically, if you are sensitive to estrogen and get hit with it pre-birth, it will masculinize your brain. But those same genes will cause feminization after you are born if you are hit with estrogen. (or fail to cause it if your estrogen sensitivity is poor)

This is literally why some of these stereotypes exist. There are 1000 ways to LGBTQ genetically, but overall, this one is fairly consistent. Not everyone, not all the time, as there are countless switch flips. But if you get basted with high estrogen signaling in utero, you're going to feel pretty masculine overall.

I'm not ready to drop my theory post on exactly how sexual orientation works, that needs some more polishing, but for now, what you need to know here is that nature likes to play jokes, and it is estrogen that makes you a man.

Estrogen also develops the penis fully, and estrogenic signaling anomalies are why so many mtf people have a urethral opening that doesn't end at a hole on the end of the penis but rather a vertical slit starting at the central penis tip, but then sliced downwards towards the bottom of the glans. This is the faintest level of detectable hypospadias. Go ahead, go look. Feel free to represent in the comments if this applies to you.

Anyway, back to why queer people and particularly MTFs have this psych connection.

Once estradiol or estrone are phase 1 metabolized into their secondary metabolite, either the 2-hydroxy or 4 hydroxy estrogens, they become something very very weak (2 hydroxy) or faintly weak (4 hydroxy). The 4 hydroxy is about half as potent as E2. The 2 hydroxies are in the 1/20th range (on average).

Now here's where it gets fun. Whats the connection between all these psych issues and trans people?

Well, the enzyme COMT has two jobs. Metabolizing neurotransmitters (like dopamine) and also degrading these estrogens into their phase 2 metabolites.

People who have slow COMT genes will have ADD (non-hyperactive type), Generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, and Autism (anxious subtype), and when Schizophrenia is at play, the paranoid type more often then the general population. This is scientifically known and proven already.

But if you've got slow COMT, and you happen to shunt towards weak estrogen products, you build those products up.

Higher and higher and higher. These products act the same as estrone does against estradiol, effectively crowding it out.

Its basically my 2016 discovery all over again. But worse, as these can't be measured in the blood. These estrogens typically are measured in the urine, and that testing is expensive.

But in short, if you monotherapy yourself too high, what will end up happening is if you have slow COMT genes, you will literally overwhelm their capacity to detoxify these weak estrogen metabolites. They will build to higher and higher levels, until effectively blocking out your receptor.

I suspect this is the true reason for:

""I got better results at the beginning of transition""

""I stopped HRT for awhile and restarted and things worked for a few weeks then stalled out again""

You might be surprised to learn not all mammals menstruate. Those that do have increased COMT activity in reproductive tissue.

There may be a benefit to the ""period"". In cis females, this may be a time for 2-catechol washout.

I don't think this is truly necessary in MTF people, but being aware of your COMT genes, and that you might hit an upper limit of estrogen activity before you hit your SHBG maximum is a possibility.

I'm still toying around with this. I have a bunch of people who were ""stalled out"", we checked a urinary dutch test (2 hydroxies were high) and whom we did things to either lower their estrogen level and/or increase their COMT activity and saw improved progress. I only have a few follow up Dutch on those people demonstrating lab improvement concomitant with the improvement in transition efficacy.

Interestingly, COMT can be boosted by methylated B supplements (something we saw sometimes improved gender dysphoria almost 4 years ago now). This is probably the reason why that worked. COMT is also supported by certain types of magnesium, and SAMe among other things.

I'm currently just messing around with the science of Phase 1 here, but Phase 2 is on the horizon of things I intend to explore. I just rarely see SULT/STS mutations in my patient genome review, but COMT mutations are insanely common. There may be benefit to Sulphoraphane to helping clear out things as well (and in phase 2).

I am undeterred by the current political climate. Me and my team (and rogue geniuses like Kate Meyer) are going to get to the bottom of why trans people exist and exactly why gender dysphoria happens. We will solve this, and in doing so, we hope to give people choices they never had before. Sometimes gender dysphoria can be fixed (I often give the case example of an FTM having it from 11-B-hydroxylase deficiency which resolved with treatment).

Sometimes it cannot be fixed (like when caused by a dead estrogen receptor gene).

But regardless of the pathway someone chooses (to treat their gender dysphoria or transition) simply understanding why the problem happened will open up new and improved treatments, which will improve patient health outcomes regardless of which path they choose. In my efforts to understand ""how it works"" I stumbled across this, which now I am using to improve MTF transition efficacy.

If you read to the very end of this very long post, thanks for supporting me these past 10 years. I'm not planning to bend the knee anytime soon. Y'all exist because god made you that way (or someone did with a drug or pregnancy uterine exposure). But what you and I choose to do about it together should be a decision made mutually at first, and ultimately by you. Not some court somewhere who has never met you or looked at your genome.

\- Dr Powers

PS: Maybe the next time I'm not totally burned out I'll do a whole post on the ""why queer people sit weirdly in chairs"" meme, but the answer is because most of you are hypermobile, and many of you with the MCAS/POTS/EDS/TIKTOK/IBS/PTSD constellation (cis or trans) have a 17-hydroxyprogesterone value of zero, and can't make cortisol on demand, so everything gets screwed up. Most of you can safely take 100mg of pregnenolone twice daily and some extra salt (ask your doctor first) and you'll likely feel better quickly. You're welcome.

PPS: I have high estrogen signaling autism (which I am now calling ""**Outism**"") which comes with high curiosity, hyperverbosity, and extremely low social fear until society punches us enough that we fall into line and decide ""society sucks because I keep trying to be nice and everyone calls me weird all the time"". Cis males that have this often ""seem"" gay as children, but are confused and angry at being called this from the time they are kids until they grow up enough to realize being called gay isn't an insult. Their high estrogen levels will make them empathetic and more sensitive than most cis men, and far less emotionally regulated. They are the ""lovable big teddy bear"" who likes magic the gathering and ren fest and rescues animals stereotype. They speak emphatically like Alistor on Hazbin Hotel (but without the evil). It is the opposite of the nonverbal, sensory stimuli sensitive kid. We love sensory input, information, and people (until we're trained to fear them). As a result, **I suck at being concise**. I literally cannot do it.

My boyfriend found some old screenshots and photos when I was showing him something on my phone they were backed up from years ago). He started asking questions, and I told him the truth  that it was complicated, but nothing physical ever happened.

Since then, he’s been calling it *emotional cheating.”*He say hat even if it was before we met, it shows what kind of person I am” and that I “cross emotional boundaries too easily. I told him that’s ridiculous  I was single when it happened, and everyone has a past.

He says I’m “invalidating his feelings” and that he deserves honesty, but I feel like he’s projecting. I told him to stop calling my past emotional cheating because it’s unfair and hurtful. Now he’s acting distant and saying I’m being defensive.

__________________________________
**2024-04-28 Sunday [Morning 09:30 AM]**

**(Normal POV)**

Mikasa slowly opened her eyes, welcoming the faint sounds of the city outside: laughter, traffic, and distant chatter. Morning light spilled through the curtains, filling her room with a soft, sleepy glow. 

She blinked a few times and turned her head toward the clock on the table.

**09:30 AM.**

With a sigh, she stared at the ceiling for a moment, letting her thoughts drift to college, her friends, and most importantly, him. After a while, she finally sat up, brushed her messy hair back, and made her way to the bathroom.

Meanwhile, a few floors below, **Eren** had been awake for a while. His apartment was quiet, aside from the faint hum of his phone screen lighting up every few seconds. He sat by the window, sipping coffee that had already gone cold. Something was clearly on his mind. His gaze shifted between his phone and the view outside, unfocused and heavy.

He had recently moved to another floor, close enough to Mikasa, but it felt like the distance between them had grown. They hadn’t spent much time together lately. No late-night talks in the hallway. No surprise visits. Just brief meetups at college or an occasional text. For some reason, that scared both of them, even if neither wanted to admit it.

Mikasa, now feeling refreshed, walked back into her room and made herself a cup of coffee. She sat at the small table near the window, steam rising from her cup, and reached for her phone.

The moment she unlocked it, her eyes softened. **Eren’s name** was at the top of her notifications.

A small smile curved her lips as she opened the chat.

**Eren [09:51 AM]:** *Hey Mikasa, did you wake up? There’s a world running around you, remember?*

**Mikasa [09:52 AM]:** *Yeah, I woke up. Also, the world can run without me. I’ll join later.*

**Eren [09:53 AM]:** *Look at her confidence.*

**Mikasa [09:54 AM]:** *Ha-ha, very funny. So, what’s the matter?*

**Eren [09:55 AM]:** *Did you have breakfast yet?*

**Mikasa [09:56 AM]:** *Not yet. What about you?*

**Eren [09:57 AM]:** *Same here. Want to grab something to eat? Together?*

**Mikasa [09:58 AM]:** *Sure. Why not? I’ll get ready. Knock when you’re done.*

**Eren [09:59 AM]:** *Okay.*

**(A few moments later)**

The two of them sat across from each other at a small nearby restaurant. The place was quiet, the kind of spot where sunlight hit every table softly through the glass windows.

Neither had said much since they arrived. Only the quiet sound of forks scraping plates and the faint hum of music filled the background.

Mikasa raised her head slightly, watching Eren eat in silence. He didn’t seem tired, but his eyes looked distant, as if he was there but thinking of something else entirely.

**“So, Eren,”** she finally spoke, resting her elbow on the table. **“Why did you bring me here? Is there something you want to say?”**

He glanced up at her, caught off guard. **“Hmm? No, not really. Just wanted to have breakfast with you,”** he replied, his tone calm but strangely flat.

Mikasa smiled faintly, stirring her coffee. **“Right,”** she said softly. **“Just breakfast, huh.”** She didn’t believe him, but she didn’t push either.

They continued eating—quietly, comfortably, but with something unspoken hanging in the air.

After breakfast, they walked side by side down the narrow lane that led back to their apartment building. Mikasa slipped her hand through his arm as they walked, leaning against him lightly. Eren didn’t pull away, but he still seemed distracted.

**“Eren,”** she said, looking up at him, **“you’ve been quiet since morning. Are you hiding something from me?”**

He shook his head quickly. **“No, I just… have some things on my mind. College stuff. That’s all.”**

She studied him for a moment, her gaze soft but suspicious. He was clearly lying, but she didn’t want to ruin the peaceful day by forcing him to talk.

So, she smiled instead. **“Alright. I’ll let it go. For now.”**

They walked the rest of the way in silence, their shadows stretching side by side on the pavement.

When they reached their floor, Mikasa turned toward her door. **“Well… bye. Love you… babe,”** she said playfully, waving her hand as she reached for her keys.

Eren froze for half a second. That was the first time she’d ever called him that.

Before she could disappear inside, he spoke up. **“Mikasa, wait.”**

She turned. **“Hmm?”**

He looked a bit nervous, scratching the back of his neck. **“You were right. I… do have something to tell you. But not now. Let’s meet later—somewhere outside. I’ll tell you everything then.”**

Mikasa tilted her head. **“This sounds serious.”**

**“Yeah, kind of,”** he said with a half-smile. **“So, yeah… bye for now, b—”** He stuttered slightly, forcing out the word, **“Babe.”**

Mikasa blinked, then laughed softly, unable to hide her blush. She nodded and smiled. **“Okay. I’ll wait.”**

As Eren walked away, she leaned against the door, her heart still racing. For a moment, all she could think about was his awkward little **“babe”** and the nervous look on his face.

But underneath that excitement, something else stirred—a quiet, uneasy curiosity.

Whatever he was hiding… she could feel it was big.


**(Eren’s POV)**

I said goodbye to Mikasa and slowly walked back to my room. My heart was still racing.

She’d called me *babe*.

It was a small word, but hearing it from her made my world stop for a moment. My chest felt warm, almost too warm. I couldn’t decide whether to smile or hide my face. I wanted to say it back to her properly, but I was too shy. Still, somehow, I managed to whisper it at the end. The way she smiled was perfect.

As soon as I stepped into the hallway, reality started to sink in. Being just one floor below her already felt tough. I could barely go a day without hearing her voice. So how am I supposed to survive what’s coming next?

My steps slowed. The air felt heavy. I shoved my hands into my pockets and kept my eyes on the floor tiles. My thoughts were louder than my footsteps.

I’ve been selected for the **research team** — the same one I interviewed for this week. It’s everything I’ve ever dreamed of. A once-in-a-lifetime chance. But to take it, I’d have to leave. Leave the city. Leave *her*.

I can’t turn it down. But how do I tell her this? How do I explain to the girl who means everything to me that I’m leaving her behind for something as selfish as a dream?

She might smile and say she’s happy for me, but I know her too well. Behind that calm expression, she’d be breaking inside.

I finally reached my room and gently closed the door behind me. The quiet hit me harder than I expected.

Leaning against the door, I exhaled deeply and rubbed my forehead. My room felt emptier than usual, as if it already knew what was about to happen.

**“I have to tell her,”** I muttered under my breath. **“She deserves to know.”**

I walked to my desk, sat down, and stared at my phone. The clock ticked loudly in the silence. Every second felt like a countdown to the moment I’d have to break her heart.


**(Time skip :- Evening 05:00 PM)**

**(Mikasa’s POV)**

The wind was soft and cool, brushing against our faces as we leaned on the bridge railing, watching the ripples spread across the lake. The golden evening light made everything feel still — peaceful, almost unreal.

We each had a cone of ice cream in hand, and for a moment, it felt like nothing in the world could ruin this quiet warmth between us. I glanced at Eren. His hair was a little messy, swaying in the wind, and the sunlight made his eyes look softer than usual.

He noticed me staring.
Without saying anything, he reached out and gently wiped a bit of ice cream off my lips with his thumb. My breath caught. My cheeks burned, and I had to look away before he saw how red I was.

He smiled — that same teasing, gentle smile that always managed to calm me — and took another bite of his ice cream as if nothing happened.

The world around us was perfect: the calm lake, the soft breeze, the sound of birds fading into the distance. Even the scarf around my neck — the one he’d given me — felt warmer somehow, like it carried his touch.

After we finished eating, we sat together on a nearby bench facing the lake. The air between us was quiet, but not empty. I rested my head on his shoulder, and he leaned his head lightly against mine. It felt right — like we belonged exactly there, in that moment.

**“So, Eren…”** I finally whispered, my voice soft against the sound of the water. **“You said you wanted to talk about something.”**

He didn’t answer right away.
When he did, his tone was careful — nervous even. **“Mikasa… I don’t know how you’ll take this.”**

I straightened up a little, looking at him. **“Just tell me. Whatever it is.”**

He took a deep breath.
**“I’ve been following that research course, remember? I told you I had an interview for it a while back.”**

**“Yeah, of course,”** I said with a small smile. **“Did you get in?”**

He nodded slowly. **“Yeah… I got selected.”**

**“That’s great, Eren. Congratulations!”** I said, my heart swelling with pride — but his eyes didn’t match the joy of the words he’d just said. They looked uncertain. Almost guilty.

**“Yeah, it is great,”** he murmured. **“But… there’s more.”**

Something inside me tightened. **“What do you mean?”**

He looked away, toward the lake. **“I didn’t think it would happen this soon, but… I have to move. Abroad.”**

My breath froze in my chest. **“Move?”** I repeated. **“Where?”**

**“France,”** he said quietly. **“It’s a research program — I’ll be working and studying there.”**

I stared at him, unable to speak. The wind felt colder now. **“So… you’re leaving?”**

He hesitated. **“It’s not what I want, Mikasa. But it’s something I’ve been working toward for years. It’s… it’s my dream.”**

I tried to swallow the lump in my throat, but the words came out shaky. **“Eren… do you really want to leave me behind for that?”**

**“It’s not like that,”** he said quickly. **“You know I care about you more than anything. But this—this is something I’ve wanted since I was a kid.”**

A mix of sadness and anger rose in me. **“So your dream is more important than me?”**

He froze, his lips parting but no words coming out. **“Both are important,”** he finally said, voice breaking slightly. **“You are important to me, Mikasa. You know that.”**

But my tears had already started falling.
He reached out and brushed them away gently, his touch trembling. I closed my eyes, feeling the warmth of his hand on my skin — wishing it could stop time, stop everything.

Then, without a word, he leaned forward and rested his forehead against mine. His breath brushed my lips as he spoke softly, almost in a whisper.
**“Mikasa… it’s only two years. You still have two years left here too. We’ll call, we’ll text — I’ll never stop thinking about you. I promise. And when we’re both done, I’ll come back. I’ll wrap this scarf around you again… as many times as you’ll let me.”**

He touched the edge of my scarf gently, smiling faintly through his own sadness. I nodded, even though my heart felt heavy. **“Okay…”** I whispered. **“I’ll wait.”**

He wrapped his arms around me, pulling me into his chest. I buried my face there, clutching his shirt as tears soaked into the fabric. Neither of us said anything more. The world around us faded — there was only his warmth, and the ache of knowing it wouldn’t last.

**(Few hours later)**

The streets were quiet when we walked back to our apartment. The sun had already set, and the city lights glowed faintly on the wet pavement.

When we reached my door, I turned to him. **“Where exactly are you going?”** I asked softly.

**“France,”** he said again. **“My flight’s tomorrow night at 9:30.”**

**“Do the others know?”**

**“Yeah,”** he admitted. **“But I told them not to tell you. I wanted to do it myself.”**

I looked down, trying to stop my tears again. **“So this is really happening…”**

He nodded. **“Yeah. But this isn’t goodbye forever.”**

He took a step closer, hesitated, then pulled me into one last hug — tighter than ever before. I could feel his heartbeat against mine. He leaned back slightly, looked into my eyes, and pressed a gentle kiss on my forehead.

When he pulled away, he gave me that small, familiar smile — the one that always made me fall for him all over again.
Then he turned and walked down the hallway.

I stood there, watching his back grow smaller with every step.
My hands slowly reached for my scarf, holding it tightly.

He’s really leaving… but I’ll wait for him. I have to. Because even if we’re far apart, my heart will still find him.

*I’m so lucky to have him — even if it hurts.

1o0mz6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1o0mz6c/i_stopped_drinking_caffeine/,I stopped drinking caffeine.,"I see the recognition in the eyes of those who have as well.

Every time I notice, they notice as well.

Their eyes widen. 

Their pupils expand.

They know.

At first, they would immediately look away.

Then we would make eye contact again, and then we understood.

But only after I stopped ingesting caffeine.

No energy drinks. No soda. No coffee. No tea. No chocolate.

It’s harder than you think, to quit.

It feels like it’s everywhere, and people ironically look at you strangely if you say that you don’t consume “energy” as well.

At this point I don’t even think it’s a stimulant.

I think it’s a memory destroyer.

One for the masses.

All to help us forget the truth that stares at us daily.

Even the withdrawals are strange, aren’t they?

Headache. Irritability. Fatigue.

**Anxiety.**

That’s the one that scares me.

Because it’s anxiety for something we should already know.

Something so terrifyingly large and humongously magnificent in scale, that it hurts not to drink coffee every morning. 

Or eat chocolate every once in a while.

It’s one of the most popular sweets for a reason.

Or sip tea at night.

Even in minuscule amounts.

Either that, or escape into sleep.

Give ourselves jobs to distract us from realizing that it’s always been there.

Create disorderly conduct on a massive scale to help caffeine make us numb to it.

Why do we feel uncomfortable looking in each other’s eyes?

It feels so damn intimate that we only do it to friends and family.

People that are close to us.

Or people we want to be.

But a lot of them are consuming caffeine as well.

Even looking at your own eyes in the mirror lets you see it.

Makes your heart beat faster, not unlike the high of an energy drink.

The jittering you feel after drinking too much.

That’s when your body rejects the compound and you start to understand again.

It’s a balancing act of keeping yourself complacent.

Also when your mind and body start to tolerate it, you take breaks, but only for a little while. 

Long enough to make yourself feel the withdrawals, but not long enough to remember why you take it in the first place.

But when you’re completely off it:

You’re looking for other people who know.

Looking for those who choose to understand.

You take a stance of not drinking tea.

Not sipping hot chocolate.

Not forgetting.

Choosing to terrorize yourself with realization of everyone around you.

Finding those who know.

Who live.

Those who gaze in the face of reality.

The reality that we are all a singularity.

A single entity of thought.

A shared life.

Together.

All.

Got the ""general alarm"" message on the touch screen.  Nothing moved or did anything when I turned it on.

I call support.  Support walks me through some reset steps using a video link sent via text message.  Pretty cool stuff for tech support.  Except the reset and attempted fixes do nothing and the infuser is more or less still welded into place for some inexplicable reason.  ***Three cups of coffee***.

Support says okay no problem, even though you have no receipt and this was a gift, we'll honor the warranty and send you a new one.  Just use your old box and send us your current machine.  I'll email a FedEx shipping label.  I get the shipping label and send it back a few days later.  I confirm it arrived at the warehouse on September 29.

After a few days, I begin calling tech support again to check the status of my ticket.  I also reply to the original email thread.  Five times.  I also attempt to start an online chat through the Delonghi website.   I waited on hold collectively for around 3 hours without a single person ever picking up the line to say ""please continue to hold"" or anything like that.  The online chat kept me on hold until it kicked me and said ""no agents are available.""  You can't even find the online chat support bubble on the support website anymore.

I call again today and the phone line says ""our phones are currently closed for agent training.  Thank you for calling Delonghi, where espresso is made right ***and our customers come first***.""  Sweet irony.

Is there some sort of catastrophic meltdown happening behind the scenes at Delonghi?  Does anyone's Eletta Explore actually work?  This is absolutely by far the worst customer service experience I've had in a long time, particularly for a $2,000 MSRP device.

I've also noted that most of the Delonghi machines are currently heavily discounted (25%+) on most websites.

1o0mxi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1o0mxi3/we_fired_18_months_ago_this_is_the_story_of_our/,"We FIRE'd 18 months ago, this is the story of our 13-year journey to get there, and what life is like now.","Hey FIRE folks, 46F here.

So I’ve thought about writing/posting this for the last year.  But Redditors can be ruthless and brutal at times, and that has kept me from posting it.  But I’ve realized that’s pretty selfish of me; I loved reading others FIRE stories while I was on my journey, so I should just pay it forward and post it. I realized I’m not writing this for the obnoxious asshats, I’m writing it for those who:

(1) want another viewpoint on the ‘Is early retirement worth it? Will I get bored?’ question…or  
(2) need further proof that you can in fact reach FIRE without being a tech bro, or...  
(3) need some encouragement in their FIRE journey…

so here goes.........

***TLDR for those who just want the cliffs notes version of this whole thing...***

We pulled the FIRE trigger 18 months ago, on March 29^(th) 2024.  

EDIT: I wasn't sure if I was comfortable putting our numbers out there, but since I already added some in the comments...what the heck I guess...our FIRE number was $1.5M in investable assets. Expenses are $50-60k annual.  Currently taking 4%WR, using ACA for healthcare.

We didn’t have tech salaries or come from wealthy families, and we had four kids to raise. Discovering FIRE, making major changes to housing, cars and food, paying off our debt, putting money away for 11 years, and then pulling the trigger at the age of 45 were all ABSOLUTELY 100% THE BEST DECISIONS I’ve ever made in my life (second only to choosing and marrying my husband.) 

We wake up every day still absolutely gobsmacked that this is our life.  Not bored, not anxious, no regrets. Still grateful, still in disbelief.  Having each day be our own to do whatever we like still gives me a thrill. 

I’ve been reading so many books, making new recipes, visiting friends, refinishing vintage furniture, baking bread, hiking, trying new restaurants and coffee shops, playing tennis. I’m not even close to being bored, and I don’t think I ever will be. 

I’m just grateful that my daily life is no longer dictated by meetings and emails and projects and expectations.  No more ‘how many PTO days do I have left this year?’  I don’t miss it one bit.

We're now on a 5-month slow travel tour of the British Isles and Ireland, a dream trip.

***The Extended Director's Cut Version of what life is like now for those who are interested...***

We did something many FIREd people do; we started traveling. Right now as I type this, I’m looking out the window of our AirBnb in Ireland, watching the waves of the Atlantic ocean hit the shore. We’re at the tail end of a 5-month slow travel top-to-bottom tour of the entire British Isles (England, Scotland, Wales) and Ireland. At the end of the month we’ll take a transatlantic cruise back to the US.  (With time no longer at a premium, we try to one-way cruise to the region of the world we want to travel to instead of fly.  No jet lag. It’s awesome.)  We already have more domestic and international travel planned for 2026 and 2027. 

We've met a lot of 'normal retirement age' people on this trip and many of them told us they're too old to travel for that many months in a row...just not physically up to it...that we're smart to do this while we're still ""young"".  I agree.  One more reason to retire early and not at 65.

FIRE is far better than either of us could have imagined.  And we imagined it A LOT.  During hard days at work, I’d daydream about it thinking “maybe someday”.  But that someday finally arrived, and I honestly didn’t know life could be this good.  Literally feel like I’m living a dream.  The freedom and financial security I feel can’t be described.  Sometimes I log in to our investment account just to prove to myself that we did it; that we’re in the double-comma club.  

Also, we’re the healthiest we’ve ever been, both mentally and physically. In fact, my husband and I have both lost 40 pounds each and revealed muscle tone we didn’t know we had. LOL. My marriage is even stronger than it was before, and we’re just so damn happy. 

***For those who are interested in the story of our journey and what we did, it’s a long one so buckle in, but here you go:***

My husband and I began our debt paydown in 2011 and 18 months later (in 2013) started our FIRE journey, with a combined salary of $140k, living in Northern California.  I was in middle management in the insurance industry and my husband worked at a hardware store.  We have four kids. 

We had hit a financial rock-bottom of sorts in 2011 which led me to googling “how to get out of debt” and that led me to the concept of FIRE.  I talked it over with my husband and we agreed to just go for it.  We would pay off our debt first, then start saving towards FIRE.  That second piece seemed a bit pipe-dreamy at the time, but there wasn’t much to lose at that point.  *The journey began.*

We immediately made MAJOR changes to our housing, cars and food budget.

Downsized our house from 4-bed 3-bath 2,500 square feet to 3-bed 1-bath 1,000 square feet.  (But let me pause there.  Yes, that’s a small house.  Before you clutch your pearls, you need to know that our degree of downsizing was *intentionally* drastic; we were not planning to live in the small house *forever*.  It was a cute house, but a bit tight for a family of 6 long-term.  But we knew if we could just make some temporary ‘big moves’ in the largest category, which was housing, we could move the needle faster. And it worked.)

Next we sold both of our cars to get rid of the car payments and bought basic, no-frill replacements with cash.  Reduced our eating out to just once a week and stopped buying soda and crappy snack food.   

All combined, these efforts freed up about $3k a month, allowing us to get out of debt in 18 months. After the debt was gone, we had a total of $4k monthly to put in our investment accounts; over time we were able to increase our savings rate to almost 50% of what we earned. 

One key thing we did to make that increased savings rate feel effortless, was to make our weekly discretionary spending a fixed dollar amount.  Both of our employers allowed us to direct our paycheck to more than one bank account, so we had a fixed amount sent to a ‘Bill Paying’ account, another fixed amount sent to our ‘Spending’ and ‘Groceries/Gas’ accounts, and then whatever was left was all directed to our investment account.  So as we got promotions and pay raises over the years, they automatically bypassed our spending account and went straight into our investment account.  We never even saw the pay bumps.  This was absolutely key to not letting our lifestyle creep up as we made more money.

If any windfalls came our way like work bonuses or tax refunds, we’d always take a portion (5-20%) and spend it on a family vacation or something else fun, and then invest the rest.

The 11-year FIRE journey was essentially a rinse-and-repeat of the above; just consistent saving and investing. We found our own perfect balance of progress and pleasure; we still took family trips and enjoyed some occasional small splurges, but we found so much happiness in simple things like picnics, family home movie nights and backyard badminton, I’m not exaggerating when I say that it didn’t feel the least bit restrictive or like we were ‘doing without’. 

But a few years in, during what they call the ‘boring middle’ of our FIRE journey, we decided to dabble in some side hustles to try and build our savings even faster.  We wanted to own a small fairly-passive business, so in 2015 we bought a tiny little self-service laundromat in a strip mall near our house.

Later, we thought it would be good to add some rental real estate to our portfolio, so in 2017 we bought a new primary home and rented out our old house (which is still cash flowing very nicely). 

And while these side hustles did contribute toward our nest egg, the vast majority of our portfolio balance grew the old-fashioned way…diligent monthly savings invested in low-cost index funds over an 11-year period.  The fact that the stock market has performed so well during that time certainly played a part in reaching our FIRE number so quickly.

In 2022, we became empty nesters when the last of our four kids went off to college.  We sold the laundromat business. Our portfolio was looking pretty good, but 2022 turned out to be a bad year for the stock market so we still had a ways to go.   

And then finally the time arrived…we hit our FIRE number in December of 2023.  I decided to try and engineer my own layoff, offering to stay for three more months to train my replacement, in exchange for a severance check equal to six months pay, on top of my salary.  They agreed.  Yay...more money to add to our nest egg.

On March 29, 2024, I closed my laptop for the last time. We had done it.  We high-fived each other and just sat stunned, enjoying the quiet of the moment.  I’ll never forget it.

So whether you're at the frustrating beginning of your FIRE journey, the boring middle or ready to pull the trigger but have one-more-year syndrome...it's worth the wait...it's worth the sacrifice...it's worth the risk.",273,1759861623.0,Fire,110,0.94,False

  I just shipped QuickSlots - a scheduling tool for one-time meetings that I wish existed every time I need to coordinate a quick coffee chat or interview.

  🔗 Link: [https://quickslots.vercel.app/](https://quickslots.vercel.app/)

  The Problem

  I got tired of:

  \- Creating Calendly accounts for one-off meetings

  \- The back-and-forth ""does Tuesday at 3pm work?"" texts

  \- Worrying about what data these platforms keep forever

  What It Does

  1. Type your availability in plain English (""tomorrow 2-4pm"", ""next Friday at 3pm"")

  2. Get a shareable link

  3. They pick a time, you both get calendar invites via email

  4. Link expires + all data auto-deletes in 24 hours

  No signup. No database of your meetings. Just ephemeral scheduling.

  Tech Stack

  \- Next.js 15 (App Router)

  \- Upstash Redis (24hr TTL)

  \- SendGrid (email + .ics attachments)

  \- Stripe (optional tips)

  \- Deployed on Vercel

 Would love feedback! Especially:

  \- Is the natural language input obvious enough?

  \- Would you actually use this?

  \- What's missing that would make it useful for you?

About a month ago, I had a drinking day — we were playing pickleball, and yeah, I drank kind of heavy. The next morning I woke up with this crazy stabbing pain on the left side of my stomach. It lasted a few seconds, went away, and I ignored it.

Fast forward two weeks later: I go out drinking again with my friend and boyfriend. I didn’t drink much but got pretty drunk. The next morning — boom — that same stabbing pain again. It went away quickly, but I started having discomfort on that side that lasted for days.

I took antacids and went to a local clinic (ngl didn’t really trust them). I asked to test for H. pylori — they did a blood test that came back negative, then told me it wasn’t accurate and I should’ve done a breath test (which they never mentioned before drawing my blood 🙃).

The doctor told me to take Prilosec and stick to a bland diet — no coffee, seasoning, spicy, or citrus. Basically all the stuff I love. A week later, I still had pain, so I got an ultrasound that said I might have kidney stones up to 6.7mm. The doctor said, “You can pass it, take chanca piedra.” (LOL because a 6.7mm stone isn’t easy to pass.)

I went back for a urine test — no blood, so probably not stones. A few days later, I started having pain on my right side too, so I went to the ER. Blood work, urine, and a CT scan all came back normal — no stones, gallbladder fine, everything looked okay.

At this point, I’m just frustrated and confused. The ER doctor said it’s likely gastritis but CT scan everything was normal, told me to keep the bland diet, and referred me to a GI — but the soonest appointment is 3 weeks away lol..

Now I’m scared to eat anything. I went to Texas Roadhouse, had one piece of bread, and felt a sharp pain again. I’ve lost 5 pounds in a week and a half, and my mood has completely shifted. Not being able to eat or drink the things I enjoy sucks — it’s crazy how fast life can change.

I’m 23F, been on Prilosec for about a week and a half, almost done. I’ve been burping a lot (maybe a side effect?), but no acid reflux — just this lingering stomach pain it comes and goes. My GI appointment is in 3 weeks, and honestly, I’m scared to eat until then.

On the bright side, I’m thankful it’s nothing major so far. I know God gives us challenges for a reason, but the pain and uncertainty are really stressful.",2,1759861608.0,Gastritis,2,1.0,False

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

I also wasn't prepared for the climbing all over furniture, standing on top of the coffee table then crying to be let down (multiply by 100 times), having him cry to be picked up only to FREAK OUT to be let back down. I have moments when I just don't want to be around him at all, and boy, talk about feeling like an awful mother.

I really enjoyed when he started walking around 1 and showing his personality. I thought wow, I'm going to be so much better with a toddler than an infant! I guess I was wrong.

He says just a couple of words and babbles a ton.. I realize some of his behavior could be him trying to express himself and I'm sure he gets frustrated at times.

Just looking for solidarity, I suppose. To those who made it through this stage -- HOW? I hate to admit it but I've lost my temper too many times to count and am just so burned out.

[One night, I was on a call with my old college friend Jessica. She’s the kind of person who’s always into spiritual stuff — crystals, meditation retreats, you name it.

I rolled my eyes at first, but curiosity won. I figured, what’s the worst that can happen? It’s just numbers, right? So, I tried it.

Here’s the thing — I was expecting generic “fortune cookie” type lines. Instead, it felt… personal. It pointed out patterns about me that I hadn’t even admitted to myself. Things like why I always second-guess big decisions, why I fall into the same type of relationship over and over, and why I’ve been restless in my career for years. It wasn’t telling me the future — it was holding up a mirror.

And here’s where it gets real: I actually started making changes. I signed up for a night class I’d been putting off forever. I stopped texting my ex when I felt lonely (that one took work). I even restructured how I approached projects at work, and for the first time in a long time, I felt like I was steering my own ship instead of drifting.

Was it magic? I don’t think so. But it gave me a framework to understand myself better, and that alone was worth it. Honestly, I don’t care whether people call it “woo-woo” or not. For me, it was a turning point.

She kept saying that she needed to go to more bookshops, and when I brought up one, she said that I should show her where it is.

We just met today, and immediately I got the sense that she wasn’t that fussed about the bookshop - in fact, we spent a solid 15-20 minutes standing in the bookshop just talking generally instead of actually looking for books (which had been the premise of this meet up). She was really chatty throughout, and never really pushed to leave either bookshop we went to, and afterwards suggested going for coffee as well. We only really went home because she had a lecture (which she was very nearly late for because she’d talked for so long). In total, we hung out for about 3 and a half hours. I paid for a couple of books and her coffee, even though she did offer to pay me back. It felt like a very natural connection, like we’d known each other for ages, and I really was taken aback by how comfortable she was talking so much - maybe it’s just her personality, but still she had a sore voice and she was still really chatty.

I walked her home then and we both said it was lovely seeing each other and that we’d keep in contact about how we were getting on with the books. This is where it gets mixed though, because there was no goodbye hug, and no real physical contact between us at all during the meeting, other than just generally walking close to each other etc. I don’t know if she just sees this as a friendly thing, although it is quite weird that she would be so set on texting me and organising an individual meet up (and stay 3 and a half hours), if she just saw me as a friend. So yeah. Don’t know how I feel about this.

1o0mo9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1o0mo9z/spoilers_all_why_veilguard_lacks_biowares_soul_in/,"[Spoilers All] Why Veilguard lacks ""Bioware's soul"" in writing","Recent discussion here inspired me to write an essay to analyze why Veilguard's writing feels uninspired, sterile or lacks the branded Bioware soul and guts

I am not a native English speaker, so forgive me some awkward phrasing. Obviously, SPOILERS as well

Before release, Veilguard was promised to be “the return to former glory” of Bioware, and post release everyone criticized Veilguard’s writing. Corporate greed killed the series, the dialogues and plots are uninspiring, and it lost its BioWare soul, etc. 

However, the problems Veiguard faced in development were not unique or started only around this game, but previous games still had “soul”. 

What is the soul of BioWare's formula? 

*I would define BioWare formula as:*

Outside threat destroys the status quo => rulers, organizations and people react to this threat => social, ideological and economic failure lead to collapse of society => MC swoops in to save the day and connect people who want and care to bring change => “end of the world” or threat serve as a background for moral, political and personal quests with emotional choices and relationships development => the conflict is stopped, and characters and the world change by the end of it. 

Veilguard, while following the same structure in its simplicity, it could not capture its spirit.

**Why?**

# 1. Tensions, power players and antagonists

**Veilguard lacks tension**

By Wilbur’s classification of conflicts in media, the type BioWare used for most of its existence would sit somewhere between Man vs. Man + Man vs. Society. 

And Veilguard lacks both an ideologically legible antagonist and social tension to grind against/ draw upon in writing the conflict. 

The premise and frame of “saving the world” stay, but the content that it results in is devoid of empathic choices, relationships drama or ideological tensions. Apocalypse doesn’t heighten any existing feuds and inequalities. The threat does not lead to political instability or failures. No one decides to tip the scales, or to move against an old enemy using the situation, oppressed do not rebel when they are left unprotected or abused. There is no conflict in the game that carries nuance or feels real. 

With political friction removed, conflicts resolve into management, and are easily solved with power of friendship and centrist peacekeeping.

The writing suffers from lack of stakes as well (or more like only one consequence): the game will not allow us to see destruction or join the evil forces, and with “stop the bad thing” being the main engine of the plot’s evolution no new stakes or losses are presented. 

**Power players lack motivation, factions are reduced to black and white “helpers” vs “maniacs”.**  

There are no main players that want to change something. There are no presented worldviews that clash. No social problems, no racial, gender or class struggles, not even mages vs templars.

In real life, and in good writing, no two people will have completely identical opinions on history, society or existential questions. 

In the game, we deal with groups of people that should have existing relationships, hidden goals and motifs. Most of them present as uniform forces with a singular mind. 

Companions and allies fit the description of goody two shoes, and anyone who disagrees goes into the camp of mustache twirling evils. 

Important characters and forces generate no drama of their own, and because their values never collide, they generate no drama for others to play against as well. 

Antagonists lack plans for “after” the victory or destruction. Powerful NPCs do not try to gain more resources. 

Also, vague ""power"" is not a valid motivator, it needs to be something TANGIBLE. 

***Narratively, conflicts are reasons we have stories.*** The obstacle is a ground on which characters’ growth or emotional revelations flourish. 

**Historically, Dragon Age has some built in conflicts and questions that are raised around them:** 

Racism and slavery (what hatred or discrimination are justified? Can this problem wait till we fix the world? Who is right in this old feud?)

Magic vs society (to which degree should magic be controlled? Are mages dangerous to themselves and non-mages?)

Religious orders and rise of theocracy (does Maker exist? Is Chantry helping the people or brainwashing them?)

Old aristocracy, problems of inheritance and distribution of power (whose claim is stronger and who do we align with?)

As well as class struggle and intersections of discriminations, immigration & war & corruption. 

DAV doesn’t explore these old conflicts, but doesn’t add any new ones as well. 

Every nation's problem is Venatori doing something. Compare it to DAO, where each nation has its own cultural clash problems unrelated to Archdemon or Loghain.

If the only tensions are between status quo vs world destruction, we have a story where characters can only play defense, and the best (and only) outcome is return to square one before the apocalypse. 

# 2. Worldbuilding and setting

While some prefer detailed recollections of every event, date or name in history of this world, I am of the opinion that setting should amplify main conflicts and strengthen the story. 

At the very least, if the conflict disrupts the state of the world, it should be shown what this state is. 

I am not talking here about showing all the previous games’ choices and their outcomes. This could not have been done for the lack of technical resources. It's hard for games to carry lots of legacy and portray every delineation well, so some sort of reboot with 10 years of development crisis is to be expected. 

What goes into “bad writing territory” is a lack of understanding what kind of world we start the story in. 

Between the events of DAI and DAV there has been 10 years. What happened to mages? What changes have happened since we last saw this world? How elves, different mage groups, governments and organizations changed? How do they react to the return of “old elven order”? What is even this order? 

Who are Evanuris outside this Blight-led murderous war and how is their culture different from the current world? What will happen if they win? What is the world that Solas wants and what will happen if he wins? 

Crows seem to be changed from DAO Crows, what made them change? What is their nationalist agenda and what do they want for their country? 

What’s up with Chantry, elves and elvenages/elven revanchism, politics of Tevinter and its opposition? 

The worldbuilding of DAV is empty. Previously gritty and rich with history of factions, territories and NPCs, it's dumbed down to one general vibe or function per place. 

# 3. Protagonists agency: 

Party are just random people who have no reason to be there or stay together

Party characters are not connected to the main conflict. They do not have reasons for joining besides Rook’s suicide mission or just being “good”, opposed to villains who are bad for wanting power. Rook is treated like the glue that brings these randos together. But besides that, there is no point to Rook. 

Characters are not battling with desires, or loved ones' resurrection, for prohibited knowledge, for revenge. They do not have personal conflicts shaped by the main events, none of the mages want to explore Fade more, none of them run from anything in their pasts. 

AND Rook is written as HR/therapist of the whole group. No personal involvement in the plots, handpicked by Varric to be “the leader”, Rook doesn’t have an agenda, doesn’t get sick, doesn’t fear or suffer, and is neutral about being the one to lead everyone into the apocalypse. It is mentioned, but we don’t even get to see their travels and relationships with Varric or “old team”. 

As the game progresses, Rook does not participate in group activities, is excluded from their own romances and has less personal conversation with characters than they do with each other. 

Rook also can’t make stances, can’t disagree with characters, however horrible they act. The replies and jokes by Rook sound like they were written for LinkedIn.

And companions are also each one flavor.

Lucanis loves his family and coffee, Harding for no personal reason cares about dwarven history, Davrin cares about turlum. Their problems can be fixed by one-liner in dialogue.

Caleb’s first breath was a mistake. It was a raw, shallow gasp that scraped against a throat crushed by calloused fingers. Fire bloomed in his neck, a searing throb with every frantic heartbeat. Each attempt to draw in more air made his ribs scream in a dull, grinding protest. Consciousness wasn't a gentle return; it was a violent eviction from the quiet nothingness that came before.

His cheek pressed against rough, splintery wood that reeked of stale alcohol, accumulated grime, and something acrid like old sweat mixed with despair. The white void was gone.

*Evelynn! Katie! Jack!*

Grief hollowed him out, a sudden, soul-deep vacuum where his heart used to be. His family's faces flashed before him—Evelynn's sleepy smile over morning coffee, Katie frantically searching for her jacket, Jack's shy grin as he hummed superhero themes. All of it lost. All of it gone.

*No, no, I was just with them... Breakfast was still warm... Evelynn was talking about Hawaii...*

He wasn't in his kitchen. Wasn't in his car. The SUV, the impact, the white void, the voice. It all cascaded back in a rush of understanding that he desperately wanted to reject.

Caleb cracked open his eyes.

He lay sprawled on the floor of a dim, filthy room. A lone shaft of grimy light sliced through a streaked window, revealing decay. The illumination seemed wrong. A deeper, richer gold than Earth's sun. It threw elongated, harsh shadows that looked somehow incorrect.

Discarded clothes formed moldering piles in corners. Empty food containers—wooden bowls greasy with congealed remnants—cluttered what passed for furniture. Dark, sticky rings marred a rickety table of unfinished wood where countless bottles had left their mark.

A small counter space served as a kitchen, if the term could be applied so generously. Etched into the surface were several flowing geometric patterns that pulsed with soft blue light. Runes. The word surfaced from nowhere, carrying absolute certainty. One of the glowing symbols was cracked, causing it to flicker erratically and emit tiny, fizzing sparks that made the air smell of scorched metal.

At the table, a man hunched over with his back to Caleb. Broad shoulders spoke of former strength, but his frame had gone gaunt, his dingy tunic hanging loose on a body that had seen better days. He lifted a crude clay bottle to his lips and drank deeply. A peeling label on the container revealed the words ""Steelbloom Brandy."" The man set the bottle down with a heavy thud and cradled a small, tarnished silver locket in calloused fists.

A memory pierced him, unbidden and sharp as a shard of glass. A woman's hands, slender and with a soft green hue, fastening that same locket around her own neck. The scent of pine needles and damp earth. Her voice, a soothing melody. *""It keeps you close to my heart, my little sprout.""*

""Feh."" The man's voice was a low, gravelly slur, bitter as the dregs of whatever poison filled that bottle. ""Thought I'd finally choked the life out of you this time, Thal."" Another swig, followed by a wet, disgusted sound. ""And now you're babbling in some made-up tongue like the village idiot. What's next, gonna start speaking to the spirits?"" He let out a harsh, mirthless laugh that dissolved into a coughing fit. ""So useless you can't even die right. Just like her."" He set the bottle down harder than necessary, and the clink sounded through the cramped room as a death knell.

The pain in his throat vanished, replaced by a new, sharp awareness. It wasn't the stone floor making him shiver; it was the certainty in the man's gaze and he turned to look over his shoulder. The voice wasn't directed at him—Caleb Foster, suburban dad and middle manager. It was directed at the body he now inhabited. The realization seeped in, bleak and absolute, filling the cracks in his fractured thoughts.

*This isn't a dream. This is real. I'm... I'm in someone else's body.*

The name ""Thalorin"" rose unbidden in his mind, carrying with it a phantom surge of fear and resentment so strong it tasted like copper. Not his emotions. Not his memories. But somehow present, lurking like shadows at the edges of consciousness.

*My family is gone. I'm dead. And now I'm here, in a kid's body, and his... father? Just tried to kill me.*

His breath hitched. This body was small. Light. Wrong in every conceivable way. And the man at the table—Rufan, the name whispered itself with inherited dread—had just casually referenced strangling him.

Survival instincts screamed through the grief and confusion. Fight or flight kicked in with primal urgency, and with this bruised, battered vessel, fighting wasn't remotely an option.

*Get out! Get out now!*

Fueled by adrenaline and pure terror, Caleb forced his foreign limbs to obey. He pushed himself up, his limbs responding with a half-second delay that felt like trying to pilot a faulty machine. The world tilted. With his center of gravity far lower than he was used to, he had to pinwheel his arms just to stay upright. This body felt wrong. But somehow, miraculously, he stayed upright. The **\[Savant of the Body\]** Impartment whispered its influence, granting just enough coordination to function despite the chaos.

He lunged for the door, movements clumsy and loud. His shoulder toppled into the frame with a sound like thunder, rattling the entire structure as he fumbled with the simple iron latch. Terror made his fingers stupid, slipping on metal slick with condensation and years of grime.

""Where the hell do you think you're going, Thal?!"" Rufan bellowed, starting to get up. 

Caleb caught a glimpse of the man. Greasy and unkempt dark brown hair on a face booze-flushed with fury, bloodshot blue eyes filled with a hate so pure it took his breath away. This wasn't anger. This was something far more dangerous. Something that wanted to hurt.

""Get back here!""

Caleb didn't hesitate. He wrenched the door open and burst into cool morning air that tasted like freedom. The door slammed into the wall behind him with a crack like breaking bones, but he didn't stop to close it. He sprinted, bare feet slapping against stone. 

The first three steps were a disaster.

*Longer legs. My legs are supposed to be longer.*

His mind commanded a stride that this body couldn't deliver, a chaotic scramble of a mind expecting a different center of mass.

*Don't fall. Don't fall, crumb, don't fall.*

But on the fourth step, something shifted. Some deep, intuitive part of him was already learning, recalibrating. The half-second delay between his mind's command and the body's response began to shrink, the flailing smoothing into a desperate but surprisingly efficient run.

A soft chime resonated somewhere deep in his mind, barely audible over his ragged breathing. Blue light-backed silver script flickered in the corner of his vision, impossible and undeniable:

**\[New Skill Gained: Balance (F) - Novice\]**

**\[New Skill Gained: Running (F) - Novice\]**

The impossible text flared in his vision, a shock so profound it nearly sent him sprawling. *What in the world was that? A report card? For running?* His mind, reeling from grief and terror, struggled to categorize the impossible. *An F. Of course it's an F.* The thought was a bitter spark in the overwhelming terror. He could not process it. Not now. He just had to keep moving.

The village street opened before him like a scene from a fever dream. Buildings of dark timber rose two stories high, their roofs capped with a thick, woven material that looked almost organic. As he ran, the strange, earthy scent of them hit him. A memory fragment returned, sharp and clear: Thal, as a small boy, standing under the eaves on a scorching day, cool mist drifting down from the roof above. His mother’s voice. *“The spongeroot breathes for us when Aurum is high.”* The memory was fleeting, but the sense of remembered relief from an unbearable heat was so real it made him notice the current chill in the air. He pushed the recollection away as he ran on.

Heads turned as the disheveled boy ran past, his flight wild and desperate. Their faces blurred together in Caleb's peripheral vision, but details still registered. A woman in pristine white robes marked with golden thread stepped delicately aside, her nose wrinkling in distaste. An elderly man in a rough-spun brown tunic and patched leather vest stopped his conversation to watch with a mixture of curiosity and concern.

Near what looked like a shop, a group of adults clustered around their equipment: leather armor reinforced with metal studs, weapons ranging from curved swords to carved staves that seemed to hum with barely contained energy. A woman with fair skin and pointed ears—an elf, his mind supplied with dreamlike acceptance—wore flowing robes in deep purple, her fingers dancing with sparks of actual fire. Magic. Real magic. 

Caleb stared wide-eyed. *Of course there's magic. It was on the checklist, I'm sure.*

They were dungeon delvers. A wave of Thal’s childhood awe washed over him, so potent it almost stopped him. A flash of memory: a warrior's boast, the glint of a reward on a tavern table. The deep, unearned longing to escape twisted in his gut. He tore his eyes away, forcing his legs to move.

Between the buildings, Caleb caught glimpses of the forest that surrounded the village. Towering evergreen trees rose like cathedral pillars, their trunks and branches draped in thick moss and lichens. Mist clung to their bases, softening edges and creating an almost ethereal quality to the wilderness. The forest felt alive in a way that suburban parks never had. Ancient, patient, and vast beyond comprehension.

Lost in the sensory overload of this new world, Caleb failed to watch where his panicked flight was taking him. He ran headlong into something that felt like a stone wall wrapped in leather.

He bounced off, stumbling but somehow managing to keep his feet through sheer momentum and the subtle influence of his borrowed coordination. Looking up, he found himself staring into the stern face of a human man holding a spear, in studded leather armor and a simple steel helmet. A sword hung at his hip, its hilt worn smooth from use. He stood with his feet planted, chin high, gaze sweeping over the street as if he owned every cobblestone.

Town guard.

""Filthy shard-scum,"" the guard snarled, lips curling back from yellowed teeth.

Before Caleb could react, before he could even think to dodge, the guard planted a heavy boot squarely in his chest. The kick lifted him clean off his feet and sent him flying backward into the mouth of a nearby alleyway. He landed hard on damp cobblestones that bit into his back through the thin fabric of his tunic. The wind exploded from his lungs, leaving him gasping like a landed fish. His already bruised ribs protested the new abuse with sharp spikes of pain that made him wonder if something had cracked.

The guard spat, hitching his belt with a smug jerk. ""Watch it, dull-ear,"" he snarled. ""The Dominion should've stomped your kind out. Give me a reason to finish the job.""

He turned and continued his patrol without a second glance, disappearing into the sparse morning foot traffic as if kicking children was just another routine duty.

Lying on the damp stone, gasping for breath that came in painful, shallow sips, Caleb's mind latched onto the insult with confused focus. *Dull-ear?*

He reached up instinctively and touched his ears. They felt... different. Higher than normal, narrowed at the top yet still rounded rather than truly pointed. A flicker of memory ignited—not his memory, but somehow present nonetheless. The sting of that word. Other children pointing and laughing. The shame of being different, of being something caught between categories.

Half-elf.

Caleb pushed himself into a sitting position, every muscle screaming protests. He watched the guard's retreating figure until it vanished around a corner. He was alone and exposed on the street, his thoughts a frantic scramble.

He needed to get out of sight. Their eyes were on him again, and he could feel it, expressions ranging from curiosity to disgust. He needed somewhere to hide, to think, to just *breathe* without feeling the burden of strangers' judgment pressing down on him.

The dark maw of the alleyway beside him offered grim shelter. Shadows pooled between the buildings, promising concealment and solitude.

He staggered to his feet and turned toward the darkness. A visceral warning shot through him, an instinct that was not his own. It was a powerful, borrowed aversion to the deep shadows ahead. Every muscle in this new body tensed, primed to flee from a threat it remembered, even if he did not.

He paused for only a second. The fear was genuine, primal and immediate, but it felt distant. His own desperate need for solitude roared louder, drowning out inherited caution with immediate necessity.

Choosing the concrete promise of cover over vague, borrowed danger, Caleb ducked into the alley.

The sudden dimness enveloped him like a stiff embrace. Damp, musty air filled his lungs, heavy with the scents of mold and decay. The oppressive silence felt more threatening than the bustling street he'd just fled, as if the shadows themselves were watching, waiting.

He had found his hiding place, but the certainty that he'd just traded one danger for another settled deep in his gut.
