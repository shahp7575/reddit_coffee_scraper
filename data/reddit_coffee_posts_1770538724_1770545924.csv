We haven’t even met,

just a photo

glowing softly on my screen.

No shared coffee, no touch of your hand in mine, just a photograph, a single quiet moment of you looking so content, so naturally beautiful, like the world had already been kind to you..

But your smile stopped me.

Not because it was perfect,

not because it tried.

but because it felt familiar.

Like déjà vulnerable.

Like I’d seen your face before

and my heart recognized you.

And for a moment,

I missed you…

Before we’ve even met.

Like sunrises and sunsets,

those soft, faithful lights that never fail to show up.

I want to be that light.

Constant

Warm

Steady

Not Sudden

Certain as Breath

Showing up whether you watch or not, warming the edges of your day without asking for applause.

And when the hours grow heavy, when the noise of living crowds your chest, I want to be there again, not brighter, not louder, but constant, like the sunset waiting patiently at the far end of the sky.

That slow burn of amber and rose, the promise that no matter what the day has done to you, something beautiful still remains.

I long to be both.

Morning when you need beginning.

Evening when you need rest.

The first hello, and the last quiet exhale. 

Because the sun does not choose what days to rise, which nights to color, it simply returns, faithful and unbroken. 

And that is how a love may be born, not in grand gestures that vanish, but in presence.

Daily

Certain

Unshaken

Strange

how one small photo

can feel less like meeting someone new,

nut somehow strong enough to stir and move something within.

Even before we meet, that's all I want to be.

Like sunrises

Like sunsets

Like me,

I matched with a guy on SparkRizz last week. He seemed totally normal. He is 55, polite, and we had a really good vibe over text. I was actually excited to meet him.

We met for coffee this morning.

I kid you not, we barely sat down before he started talking about his divorce. I tried to be nice. I nodded. I said, ""Yeah, that sucks.""

But then he kept going. He literally pulled out his phone to show me angry texts from his ex-wife. He started complaining about her lawyer, her spending, and how she turned the kids against him.

I sat there looking at my coffee and realized: He doesn't even see me. He didn't ask me a single question. To him, I was just a pair of ears. I was just a trash can for him to dump his problems into.

I interrupted him and said, ""Look, I’m sorry you’re going through this. But I’m looking for a date, not a therapy session.""

And I left.

I feel mean. I feel rude. But I also feel like…it is always women’s job to fix broken men. They come onto dating apps even though they clearly haven’t processed their past.",10,1770545536.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False

This is going to be a little ranty but I’ve gotten out of a 5 year relationship last year, took some time to feel myself again and have been trying to get back in to dating again. I’m 27 and I feel like my clock is ticking. But dating in London is terrible.

This has been my issue, my friends aren’t helping because they don’t know a lot of single male friends. I spoke to their boyfriends and they are all either too shy to talk or dont know anyone themselves.  

Dating apps have become overwhelming now, it’s clear that they guys just swipe on anyone and don’t read profiles. Plus it’s exhausting I just go through highs and lows which really messes with my head.

I’m not doing Thursdays, been to one, it felt very predatory, think gazelles on the savanna with hyenas staring at them.

Meet-up isn’t great for my age range as most people are much older than me. Plus I’ve found the male to female ratio a bit unsettling in meet-up (I know strange to say that but it’s intimidating rocking up to an event where 75% are men out of your age range).

I’m doing a few groups but they don’t meet often and are oversubscribed. Trying to find more as this seems to be a good avenue, lots of people my age passionate about their interests. I want some low-key groups, where I can sit and chat with a guy.

So I guess I don’t have many options left. Honestly what I’m looking for is someone who is passionate about something (hence why I joined groups), emotionally intelligent, above all else is single, and is in the 26-30 age range. 

How do I find this in London? Where are all of you going or have gone to find this? Are there any interesting events (not like Thursday)? I saw a great idea of a coffee shop doing matchmaking but I was too late to sign up.

1qz55xf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qz55xf/what_actually_makes_someone_unshakeable_the/,"What Actually Makes Someone ""Unshakeable"": The Psychology of Inner Peace","I spent months obsessively studying people who stay calm when life gets chaotic. Not the fake ""good vibes only"" crowd, but the genuinely grounded ones. What I found completely shifted how thinking about peace of mind.

Most of us chase inner peace like it's some destination. Spoiler: it's not. The people who actually have it? They treat it like a skill they practice daily. They're not special or enlightened, they just know things most of us don't.

Here's what the research shows, what books taught me, and what therapists actually recommend:

**They protect their nervous system like it's their job**

Your body keeps score of everything. Stress, trauma, anxiety, it all gets stored physically. Read [""The Body Keeps the Score"" by Bessel van der Kolk](https://ia601604.us.archive.org/35/items/the-body-keeps-the-score-pdf/The-Body-Keeps-the-Score-PDF.pdf) (neuroscientist, trauma expert, literally changed how we understand PTSD). This book is dense but INSANELY good. It explains why your body freaks out even when your mind knows you're safe. Understanding this alone made me less harsh on myself.

Peaceful people know their triggers and avoid unnecessary chaos. They don't doomscroll for hours or surround themselves with drama. They literally treat their nervous system like a battery that needs protecting.

**They sit with discomfort instead of running**

This one's brutal but true. Most anxiety comes from avoiding feelings, not the feelings themselves. When something uncomfortable shows up (sadness, anger, fear), peaceful people don't immediately distract or numb out. They feel it, process it, let it move through.

Try the Finch app for this. It's a self-care app disguised as a cute bird game, but it teaches you to check in with emotions daily. Sounds silly, works surprisingly well. It gently pushes you to name what you're feeling instead of just existing in a fog of ""bad vibes.""

**They understand their attachment style**

Your relationship patterns directly impact your inner peace. If you're anxiously attached, you're probably spiraling about what people think. If you're avoidant, you're probably emotionally numb and wondering why nothing feels right.

""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller breaks this down perfectly. It's backed by decades of psychology research and explains why you do the things you do in relationships. Once understanding anxious attachment, so many patterns clicked. This book genuinely changed relationships.

**They build a STRONG foundation before anything else**

Sleep, movement, nutrition, sunlight. Not sexy, but non-negotiable. Your brain literally cannot regulate emotions properly without these basics. Peaceful people prioritize boring fundamentals over quick fixes.

For a more structured approach to building these habits, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)  creates personalized learning plans around emotional regulation and mental health. It pulls from psychology research, trauma experts like van der Kolk, and therapy frameworks to build a roadmap tailored to your specific struggles, whether that's anxious attachment or nervous system regulation. You can ask its virtual coach about your patterns, get book recommendations, and customize the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The audio format makes it easy to learn during commutes or walks, and you can pick voices that actually keep you engaged instead of zoning out.

Start small with the basics though. Walk 20 minutes daily. Sleep 7+ hours. Eat actual food, not just coffee and anxiety. Sounds obvious but most of us ignore this and wonder why we feel like garbage.

**They reframe pain as information, not punishment**

This was huge. Peaceful people don't see hard emotions as something wrong with them. They see them as DATA. Anxiety? Your body's trying to tell you something. Anger? There's a boundary being crossed. Sadness? You lost something that mattered.

Therapist [Esther Perel's](https://www.estherperel.com/) podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"" does this beautifully. She helps people decode their emotional patterns in real therapy sessions. Listening taught that emotions aren't the enemy, ignoring them is.

**They accept that control is mostly an illusion**

You can't control outcomes, other people, or most of life, honestly. Fighting this creates suffering. Peaceful people focus on what they CAN control: their reactions, their boundaries, their daily habits.

""Meditations"" by Marcus Aurelius (Roman emperor, Stoic philosopher) is 2,000 years old and still relevant. It's literally his personal journal about staying calm during war and chaos. Short, powerful, makes you realize humans have always struggled with the same stuff.

The truth? Inner peace isn't about eliminating problems. It's about building a stable core that doesn't collapse when life gets messy. Biology, trauma, and modern chaos make this harder for some of us. But it's trainable. These tools actually work if you use them.

Start with one thing. Protect your nervous system, learn your attachment style, or just take a damn walk. Peace isn't a personality trait you're born with. It's a practice.",1,1770544923.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

the copy that got us there was stupidly short like 29 words total

The Copy:

Hey, What if you could pull unlimited lead lists for less than your coffee budget?

Want a quick sneak peek?

P.S. We onboarded Cold IQ, Scale Topia, Outbound Consulting

Thats it and no feature breakdown and no ""our revolutionary platform""

Just a question and a soft CTA

Why this worked

1. Brevity actually is the soul of wit

Shakespeare said it and cold email proves it. I tested 70 words copy, 100 word, 150 word copy but this 29 word version crushed all of them

and the reason is because people dont have time they are literally just scanning and if you cant say it in under 30 words then you are asking them to invest attention you havent earned yet

2) dont give everything away in email 1

the instinct is to explain your whole offer so they understand it but thats backwards in reality the job of the first email is just to spark curiosity and get a reply and if you tell them everything upfront theres nothing left to talk about

""unlimited lead lists for less than coffee budget"" hints at value without explaining the whole system and they have to reply to learn more thats the point

3) keep the CTA stupid light

didnt ask for a call, didnt ask for 15 minutes because asking for too much upfront kills momentum

just sent""want a quick sneak peek?"" because the lower the commitment the easier it is to say yes and you can always escalate to a call after they reply and show interest

4) name drop your best customers

adding Cold IQ, Scale Topia and Outbound Consulting in the PS made a huge difference. as these are names people in the cold email space recognize and if they know them then thats instant credibility

even if you dont have big names yet offer something free like an audit and give them a reason to reply beyond just curiosity

The real lesson is that most people overthink email #1. They try to explain everything, overcome objections and establish credibility

Just make them curious enough to reply thats it

Once they engage then you share more because email #1 is just about getting them to raise their hand

1qz52mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/1qz52mp/brethren_charity_sues_woman_allegedly_abused_by/,Brethren charity sues woman allegedly abused by an elder,"# The Exclusive Brethren’s Australian-based charity, the Rapid Relief Team, is suing a former member who escaped the church aged 17 after what she says was years of childhood sexual abuse.

  
**Michael Bachelard - The Age -  8th February 2026**

https://preview.redd.it/fcuurh1et8ig1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=4376632ba53fa851edc3998b35c903f33573ad5c

The former member, Cheryl Bawtinheimer, has complained to police in her home town in Canada that she was sexually abused between the ages of about three and 12 by an elder of what’s now known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.  
  
In the past four years she has, with other former church members, produced a podcast on YouTube called Get a Life: Ex-Cult Conversations. The podcast focuses on what they say is widespread abuse and mistreatment within the church, which is run out of Sydney by so-called “Man of God” Bruce Hales.  


https://preview.redd.it/3uh042pht8ig1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=33d8bf017b92a864fd3b2c558743a82bf2421928

Now the Rapid Relief Team (RRT), the church’s public-facing charity, alleges Bawtinheimer infringed its copyright in some of those videos. The Brethren charity is demanding a jury trial in California, unspecified financial damages, and that a number of Bawtinheimer’s videos be taken down.  


The RRT attends natural disasters and other large events – including the police line at a recent murder investigation – to hand out refreshments to emergency service workers.

https://preview.redd.it/sasmd84lt8ig1.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=33b061dc65e31eae88665b4ee2e63bb6e21ecafc

In Victoria over summer, they served food and chatted to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who has previously called the church a “cult”. They claimed on a Facebook post this demonstrated Albanese was “showing support for our community”.  
  
A number of Bawtinheimer’s podcasts have criticised the RRT, claiming it’s intended not for any real charitable purpose, but to put a positive gloss on an otherwise brutal church. As part of these videos, the charity’s Kookaburra logo, “Cookie”, has flashed up on screen.  


The church’s charity claims in a legal filing obtained by this masthead that Bawtinheimer’s actions have caused them material loss and damage. The lawsuit was filed in the district court of northern California, where YouTube is based.

The RRT has demanded all videos mentioning the charity be removed, and that Bawtinheimer pay them any profits derived from the videos, as well as “monetary relief”. YouTube has already removed seven videos in response to complaints.

“They want everything gone,” Bawtinheimer said. “If they get a judge in their favour, they’ll get rid of everything. One video had 336 views, the other had 160 or something. We don’t make any money on this. We’ve made a few hundred dollars total on YouTube. It’s a classic intimidation tactic to try to shut me up,” she said.  
  
Bawtinheimer said her long-time alleged abuser was photographed in 2023 wearing an RRT uniform. “One of the charity’s volunteers in Canada was a man who sexually trafficked me – and now this charity is suing me,” Bawtinheimer said.

The Rapid Relief Team was set up in 2013 at the same time as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church successfully argued to the British charities regulator that it should keep its tax-free status because it was serving a genuine public benefit.

The RRT is described by critics and many who have left the church as an attempt to rehabilitate the Brethren’s poor global reputation, which includes separating families, treating women as second-class citizens and preaching hatred of non-believers.

Leaked church documents also reveal that one of the charity’s driving purposes is to “engage with a person of influence or status at a local level”.  
  
Court documents show the Kookaburra logo, Cookie, was bought by the charity in September last year. The purchase occurred soon after Bawtinheimer’s husband confronted her alleged abuser at his home in Canada.

In that videotaped confrontation, the abuser appeared at times to acknowledge his crimes. Bawtinheimer has reported the alleged abuse to local police, but no arrest has been made or charges laid.

Three months later, in December, the Australian charity’s California-based lawyers, Brown Rudnick, started issuing copyright demands to YouTube to remove Bawtinheimer’s RRT videos. YouTube’s copyright takedown policy uses a three-strike system geared towards removing allegedly infringing content and penalising creators.

Three active copyright strikes within a 90-day period results in a YouTube channel being terminated, all videos being removed and a ban on creating new channels.

“They want the channel scrubbed of RRT,” Bawtinheimer says.  
  
One video RRT has already succeeded in taking down is by former church member, New Zealand-based Lindy Jacomb, who runs her own charity for people escaping “high demand religious groups”. In Jacomb’s video, the logo, and one of RRT’s catch lines, “compassion in action” flashes onto the screen as Jacomb recalls the “profound trauma of being excommunicated from this church and the ongoing separation from family and community”.

She calls for RRT to collaborate with her own charity, Olive Leaf Network, in helping those who leave the church.

https://preview.redd.it/zgewnwcot8ig1.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=40d44b158ac73384be1bfbffc35eee502456c1e4

“I would like to say to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and to the Rapid Relief Team: how is it that you can give out branded bottled water and soap to strangers, and yet we, former members from your church community, are left branded with trauma. What are you going to do about us?”



The copyright complaint means Jacomb’s video is no longer available on YouTube.

An RRT spokeswoman did not answer a series of questions from this masthead because the matter was before the courts.  
  
“We will not be commenting at this time on active legal proceedings, other than to confirm that this action relates solely to the protection of RRT’s copyright work,” the spokeswoman said in a statement.  
  
“Like any responsible organisation, RRT has taken steps to protect itself from its own brand being infringed which undermine the efforts of our hardworking volunteers.”  
  
Asked specifically about targeting an alleged sex abuse victim, the spokeswoman said: “RRT takes any allegation of abuse very seriously and would always encourage appropriate involvement of the authorities.”

The RRT has tax-free status as a charity in Australia. Its financial report to the Australian Charities and Not-for profits Commission are overdue, but the previous year’s accounts show it had a $4.3 million cash surplus.

Businesses in Goulburn whose owners run RRT, were raided by the Australian Tax Office in 2024. There is no suggestion that the raids are connected to the RRT or its work. The ATO investigation into the Brethren’s vast financial “ecosystem” – which includes businesses, investment vehicles, charities and schools – is ongoing.  
  
Taxpayers have given it $680,000 via federal government grants since 2020, paying for mobile coffee machines, cooking equipment, lighting towers and other equipment. The largest grants, of up to $22,000 each, were paid under the Morrison government’s heavily rorted Commonwealth’s “Stronger Communities” scheme.

Church members donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to right-wing activist group Advance during the last federal election, and the church’s leaders ordered thousands of its members to man polling booths in support of Peter Dutton’s election campaign.

 Automatically I’m saying/thinking, “omg I need to die” “that was so embarrassing why am I so fucking stupid” “I bet I look fucking stupid as hell kms” “I look incredibly ugly” “the coffee shop barista gave me a look holy shit I’m such a fuck up why didn’t I…” “why do I exist if I’m a waste of space” “fuck my stupid fat ass life”

Not very good thoughts to have about myself when I’m trying to be a self assured person who has faith in the life I deserve 🤨.

Been to therapy for years. Am aware of journaling and certain therapeutic techniques. Briefly done meditation. But I feel like it’s so hard to be consistent. I easily go back to my old way when I experience negative stuff whether from outside influence or my lack of accountability for my progress which makes me sad. I just stop when I feel like I could never get better and the cycle continues.

It’s even hard for me to stop myself in the moment and realistically understand that what I’m thinking is “technically untrue.” I’m deeply moved by the negativity for myself. 

Excuse my English and lack of grammar. I am just tired of living the life I have right now because I am unable to accept myself and believe that I can be better/good.

1qz521l,https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedMentality/comments/1qz521l/the_psychology_of_making_people_actually_like_you/,The Psychology of Making People Actually Like You (not the recycled BS),"Spent months diving into social psychology research, attachment theory, and honestly? Most ""how to be likable"" content is recycled garbage. After reading [The Like Switch by Jack Schafer](https://jackschaferbooks.com/) (ex-FBI behavioral analyst who literally wrote the playbook on getting criminals to trust him), [Influence by Robert Cialdini](https://www.influenceatwork.com/) (the godfather of persuasion psychology), and binging way too many Charisma on Command videos, I realized we're all doing this wrong.

Here's what actually works:

The ""spotlight illusion"" is killing your social game

Most people think everyone's analyzing their every move. Reality check: people are too busy worrying about themselves to notice you fumbled that joke or said something slightly awkward. Cornell research shows we overestimate how much others notice our mistakes by like 200%. Once I internalized this, conversations became weirdly easier. You're not the main character in everyone else's story.

Stop performing, start noticing

Biggest thing from Schafer's FBI work: people don't remember what you said, they remember how you made them FEEL. And the fastest way to make someone feel good? Actually pay attention. Not that fake nodding while planning your next story. Real attention.

Try the ""triple nod"" technique, sounds dumb but it works. When someone's talking, give three small nods. Neurologically, this signals you're engaged and actually triggers them to open up more. Pair it with ""strategic silence"" because most people are terrified of pauses and will fill them with deeper thoughts.

Also, ditch the compliment sandwich approach. Research from Wharton shows specific, unexpected compliments work better. Instead of ""nice shirt,"" try ""you have really good taste in colors, that shade actually works perfectly with your undertone."" Weirdly specific equals memorable and genuine.

The ""Benjamin Franklin effect"" is insane

This blew my mind. Franklin discovered that asking someone for a SMALL favor makes them like you more, not less. Goes against everything we think right? But asking for help triggers cognitive dissonance, their brain goes ""why would I help them unless I actually like them?""

Used this at work. Asked a colleague I barely knew if she could recommend a good podcast about our industry. Two weeks later we're grabbing coffee regularly. The favor has to be small and genuinely something they can help with. Don't ask your barista to help you move apartments.

Mirror neurons are your cheat code

Subtle mirroring (matching someone's energy, not mimicking them like a psycho) activates mirror neurons that literally make people feel connected to you. If they're speaking quietly, lower your volume. If they're animated, bring more energy. This is huge in dating too.

But here's the thing nobody talks about: you also need to lead sometimes. Can't just be a social chameleon. Once rapport is built, gradually shift the energy where you want it. This is how therapists work, they mirror initially then guide the conversation somewhere productive.

Name repetition (but make it natural)

[Dale Carnegie](https://www.dalecarnegie.com/) was right about this in [How to Win Friends](https://www.dalecarnegie.com/), but most people overdo it and sound like a used car salesman. Use someone's name max 2-3 times in a conversation, and ONLY when it flows naturally. ""Hey Sarah, what did you think about..."" feels engaging. ""Sarah, Sarah, I was thinking Sarah..."" feels like a hostage negotiation.

The vulnerability paradox

[Brené Brown's](https://brenebrown.com/) research at University of Houston proves this: appropriate vulnerability creates connection faster than any ""impressive"" story. Sharing a genuine struggle (not trauma dumping on a first date) signals trust and makes you human.

Tried this at a networking event. Instead of rattling off achievements, mentioned I was nervous because I'm naturally introverted. Three people immediately related and conversations got way deeper. The key word is APPROPRIATE. Read the room.

[BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/) is an AI-powered personalized learning app that's been solid for building these social psychology and likability skills consistently. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it transforms content from books, research papers, and expert talks into custom podcasts tailored to your specific goals. Type in what you're working on, like developing genuine likability or mastering social dynamics, and it pulls from vetted sources to create a learning plan just for you. You control the depth, from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive too, everything from calm and educational to sarcastic depending on your mood. Makes it easy to fit real growth into commute time or gym sessions without feeling like work.

Use emotional awareness to build connection

Understanding emotions accurately helps you read a room. Why does this matter for likability? Because most people are emotionally illiterate and it shows. They can't read a room, they overshare, they miss social cues.

Building emotional granularity, being able to distinguish between ""annoyed"" and ""frustrated"" or ""excited"" and ""anxious,"" makes you infinitely better at connecting.

The ""peak-end rule"" for memorable interactions

Nobel Prize winner [Daniel Kahneman](https://www.danielkahneman.org/) discovered we judge experiences by their PEAK moment and how they END, not the average. Apply this to social interactions. Make one moment genuinely fun or memorable, and end on a high note even if the middle was meh.

Last week at a boring work dinner, I made one ridiculous joke that landed perfectly (peak), then left shortly after while energy was still good (end). Got way more follow-up messages than from events where I stayed till the awkward end.

Stop seeking approval, start offering value

This mindset shift changed everything. Instead of ""how do I make them like me,"" ask ""what can I offer this person?"" Could be a laugh, an interesting perspective, a genuine compliment, a useful connection.

The paradox: when you stop desperately wanting to be liked, people like you more. Neediness repels, abundance attracts. Took me forever to internalize this but it's the meta-game of all social dynamics.

Look, none of this is manipulation if your intent is genuine connection. These are just tools to express the better version of yourself more effectively. We're all playing a social game whether we admit it or not. Might as well learn the actual rules instead of fumbling through with advice from 2010 Buzzfeed articles.

The people who seem ""naturally charismatic""? They've just internalized these patterns through trial and error. You can speed run that process by actually studying the psychology instead of pretending social skills are some mystical gift you either have or don't.",1,1770544531.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False

1qz4ziu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qz4ziu,Disappointing experience in 6 Star cruise at Halong Bay - Azura cruise.,"
This is my experience on a “luxury” six-star Azura cruise. 

We booked the Horizon Suite (2nd floor). For the 2 of us, we paid $465 USD for a 1N 2D trip. I was not planning to leave a review, at least not this soon, but the Azura guide insisted that I complete my booking by submitting a review on the Viator app because it was their company policy. Since I’m already writing a review on Viator, I thought I’d share it on Reddit as well.

It was uncomfortable that the guide pressured me to open the Viator app and write the review on the spot, on the bus, while other passengers were around. Initially, he said it was a policy and that I had to do it. When I questioned him and pointed out that there is nowhere on the Viator site stating that a review is required to ""complete"" a booking, he then said it was optional, and just a company's policy.


1. Food
The lunch buffet on the first day was probably the best meal offered. It was disappointing to see a 6-star cruise buffet not properly replenished. This applied to all buffet meals except dinner, which was a course meal.

To be clear, most food items were well replenished, except for the most popular ones, especially fruit. Also, the watermelon juice at the breakfast buffet was watered down.

The dinner course meal provided two main dishes.. The pumpkin soup had a good taste, but everything else was about a 5–6/10 rating imo.



2. Misleading photos

The cruise photos look similar to the actual ship, but most appear AI-generated or Photoshop drawn?. I don’t believe they are real photos, and this felt misleading and not fully representative. That said, I also take some responsibility for not taking a closer look at the photos on the Viator site. But I honestly don't think it's hard for Azura to hire a professional photographer to take actual photos. Please refer to the photos I uploaded.

4. Room
The room photo on Viator showed a king bed with a small lounge chair and a side table, which is what I expected. Instead, we were given a room with an additional twin bed. I wasn’t expecting this, as  I had confirmed via WhatsApp with the coordinator that we wanted a room with a king bed. It made access to the balcony much harder and left less room to move around or open our luggage. 

5. Pool
The biggest issue was the pool water. It had a yellowish color, and there was no active filtration system running. The pool was half full, and it’s not the depth you can really swim in. I brought swimwear specifically for this, but I did not even consider getting into the pool.



6. Arrival and departure lounge

The overall process felt unorganized. The staff looked too busy to help or answer questions. Check-in was okay in my opinion, but the checkout process was frustrating.

We arranged one ride with Azura from Ha Long to Hanoi. I initially planned to book a separate limousine bus through a travel company, like the one I used to get to Ha Long, but I thought it would be smoother to go through Azura. I was wrong.

We were not given any instructions in advance about which bus or car we were assigned to. My partner and I had to repeatedly ask multiple staff members which ride was ours. We were only able to board after everyone else had already loaded their luggage and taken their seats. Honestly, I feel we would have missed it if we had not been very proactive. I would have appreciated a single message explaining the ride arrangement at least 30 minutes in advance, especially since I requested and already paid for the ride before the cruise.



6. Ride from Ha Long to Hanoi
We paid Azura $15 USD for a one-way transfer from Ha Long to Hanoi, and I instantly regretted booking this instead of using my original limousine company.

The limousine bus we previously booked through a tour company was faster because it did not stop for breaks or lunch and went straight to the destination. It also had better and more comfortable seating. It costs only $1 extra. 

The bus arranged by Azura made 2 stops, one for gas and one for the driver’s lunch. The gas stop was fine. The lunch stop was the problem.

The guide explained that (I’m quoting exactly what he said) “the driver was very hungry and needed a 30-minute lunch break”, which I was completely fine with. The issue was the lack of transparency about where we were stopping. The lunch stop was clearly a tourist trap. It was filled with overpriced souvenir shops and snacks, with tourists only. Since everyone had to get off the bus for 30 minutes, people naturally walked around. I noticed many passengers buying snacks or items simply because there was nothing else to do. This place is clearly coordinated with travel agencies to funnel tourists into spending money.

I would still  have been okay with this if the guide had been honest about it. Instead, he only said, “The driver was very hungry and needed to stop for lunch.” I did not see the driver eating anywhere in that place, and I specifically looked around to see if there were any nearby local food options, as it was way overpriced. There were none within walking distance.

I am writing this review so people know what to expect if they choose Azura. There were other small issues, but I’m not even going to discuss those. This is marketed as a top 6-star cruise, and I expected better.



I do want to note some good things. 

- There was a gentleman who played an instrument during the meals, and it was absolutely great. He was probably the highlight of the cruise for me.

- The bathroom and dining hall looked identical to the images on Viator. Both were beautiful.

- The Vietnamese coffee was one of the best I’ve had so far in Vietnam. The price is not disclosed until near checkout when you are given the final bill, but the cruise does state that beverages are not included. And I thought the price was very reasonable for what they charge on a six-star cruise, about 75000 VND/cup. 

Despite having an upsetting experience on the cruise, I still love Ha Long Bay. The experience on the cruise was pretty upsetting, but while staying at Halong bay in IHG, I had an unforgettable experience there. 

If you are visiting Ha Long Bay, I would strongly suggest booking two nights at the IHG InterContinental Ha Long Bay instead. It’s a 5-star hotel. We stayed there for 2 nights before the cruise, and the hotel was excellent. The photos you see are an exact reflection of what you get, and every room has a sea-view balcony.

Even with breakfast included, 2 nights there cost less than 1 night with Azura. You also get much better service and direct beach access. The level of service from the staff is not even comparable.

After 1 week of use here's an update:

1. Most colleagues have no clue what they're doing but they still taste a big difference between a Jura espresso and the ECM Mechanika IV.

2. We're going to do a barista training at the office to get everyone onboard in making a coffee but also machine maintenance (always cleaning up after use for example).

3. For 3 days a week it's pretty quiet in the office (15 people), but two days a week is mayhem with 40 people and since they don't want to wait or spend too much time making their coffee they still opt for Jura.

4. The espresso machine is on between 9am and 2pm. We turn it off after lunch to avoid overheating but it's obviously still very demanding on the machine.  
  
Because it's sooo obvious that the same coffee tastes much better (even without optimizing the shot) we're basically onboarding a new wave of coffee enthusiasts. The coffee at home market will definitely continue growing.

They said I punched and slapped my father but all I could remember was this beating pain from the right of my skull. The frontal lobe most likely had been disturbed for the time being, but they wanted to keep me there just as they keep all their patients for monetary gain, $2500 per person, and as they used me and my health as a sponsor to gain more patients and notoriety, they used my family as leverage noticing that they were the ones that weren't sure about what happened, nor wanted me to come home. As I stood staring into the abyss, the hard glass bolted against the metal embroidering of a so-called room, where the walls always felt like they were closing in, as the light from the hallway ceased to ever beam away because the only rule was to keep our doors open. Those lights never turned off, even at night, just so there was access for whomever was doing the nightshift to check up on us 10-15 minutes as we slept to make sure we were asleep. I had a roommate that always talked on the phone, trying to reach out to a girl that he was in love with, and knowing how desperate he wanted to be with her, I held onto that memory of him constantly on the phone; cause everyone could hear it. I overheard him talking about how he'll be out soon and how he wanted to have a baby with her. He told me how his family wanted him out soon as well. All this and more. But he most importantly told me that they only want you to say things that they would like to hear. Those who control you and know that you're not supposed to be where you are, would still do anything to ignore you in order to prove they are right and to humiliate you into believing you are wrong, either by giving you drugs that aren't meant for you and/or either through blame. That being said, I was the only one in the psychiatric hospital that was self-aware and not a danger to others, nor myself. I highly doubt that a quarter of the people there were a danger because I know I was put there because they thought I hurt my Dad, but as the days went by and as night just felt like dusk, darker and darker, like looking into eyes that lack color; getting lost in their pupils of misdirection, only to finally be out of the hospital after winning the hearing. The doctor was trying to use my family as leverage, especially my mom, convincing her that I should stay at the hospital for longer, giving me a paper stating that I wasn't a harm to myself nor others by crossing off both options #1 and #2, but leaving #3 circled; the only thing that they could claim: disabled/not being able to provide for myself (neither one being true-all three being lies on a piece of paper). This is why I won the hearing and managed to be discharged from the psychiatric hospital. But somehow word got around, probably because I went to the shelter and slept there for just one night, and I kept being followed as if everyone knew I was leaving to LA. So much so that the entire city was doing all they could to stop me from leaving, especially when I was already discharged and was looking everywhere for a spot to load my cash into my card; it was nearly impossible because everyone was following me, juicing the battery from my phone, using AI and other methods to communicate through their group chats and hypocritical narrative actor walking around ""trading futures,"" one would say. I left the shelter I was at because I was already free and discharged, meaning that I could finally live my normal life, whatever ""normal"" is after the damage had been done by those at the facility taking away my time, sleep, and my daily diet, being reduced to a patient when I always felt like I knew the problems of people more than they could ever imagine. I managed to get a ticket to LA but for some reason the bus driver just didn't want to get my luggage from the bus when I got there. She wanted me to crawl inside the bus and get my own bag from the other side of the door that could be opened. When she opened the luggage door, she said ""Go get your bag."" I told her ""Isn't it your job?"" Then she said, ""Okay fine,"" closed the luggage door, ""I'll go to the other side and open the other door,"" and as we both walked to the other side, I said, ""Is everything okay?"" She responded with ""Just get your bag."" I got my bag and said ""Thank you, have a good night."" Then she kept staring at me, as if she just hated me for no reason at all, that glare just looked into my soul as if she just wanted me gone for no reason. I stood there just to show her that I wasn't going to be disrespected like that, so I waited, and she said, ""Get away from my bus,"" when I was literally not even close to the bus, just toward the side, not even close to where she was getting on. She proceeded to say, ""There are cameras everywhere and we both know that the police will be here."" I had no idea what she was talking about and I wasn't going to think about the psychiatric hospital I was discharged from, because I was already free and back into the real world because I won the hearing; there was clearly no issue upon me nor was there anything wrong with me. I walked around as if I wanted to just sit down and reflect on how she treated me, driving reckless, making me feel uncomfortable, almost as if she was timing the breaks and turns of the bus messing with my sleep, posture, and health on the bus, and there was this one time where I got up, maneuvered to the restroom where she would deliberately pull on the breaks and my phone in my pocket slammed into the side door of the restroom in the bus, almost having me bust a rib. That being said, when we arrived, there was no reason for her to not get my bag and continue to treat me that way as if the other side had no door to open when in reality the bus had two doors, only having her mention it in the end, and even then she still refused to get my bag. This is where the story begins. I arrived into LA and this bus driver called the police on me. So that was when something clicked in my brain: if the world is f\*cking with you repeatedly, might as well troll them back by framing the spectacle. They sent helicopters, the entire cavalry, looking for me as if I am a harm to society when I am just on vacation. I stayed there, looking at helicopters and every kind of cop car impaginable, as the police drove by, and create a whole scene, yet no one was able to speak to me and ask my side because even they knew this was a waste of time. Maybe they started looking for someone else, but I kept it cool and waited till the commotion was over, so much so that I donated my clothes to a homeless man, giving him my entire music catalogue (CD's), cards, collectibles, an Xbox 360, and my headphones/speaker. I gave him all the clothes in my luggage and everything else, leaving me with just the clothes I was wearing and my journals, documents, and my two phones. I kept everything that I could because I didn't want to make a whole scene because I wasn't sure whether the cops were looking for me or someone else. I felt like I was Venom, or at least, a Symbiote Spidey (Symbiote Spider-Man). I left Union Station, walking around as if I was homeless, stumbling with barely enough energy because I felt like I was drained by the insects that would suck my blood from the dirt where I was hiding. The security showed up, they asked me if I was okay, but I was so illiterate, playing the part, and walked passed them, crossing the street, and even then, a truck tried running me over, barely missing me by an inch. The homeless people on the other side told me that it was like a movie. I walked around LA, made friends, got high, drank some amazing coffee, had a spiritual awakening with God, and sat by Echo Park, feeling like it wasn't LA, it was just a version of it that reminded me too much of the hard times back home, especially when I went to the Target store to grocery shop only to spend more money than I should. The only thing that kept me from staying there was when I failed to get a battery pack from Target when it was for USB-C not iPhone. I was too focused on the bags I brought in, worrying I would be robbed and I won't have nothing to take back home, so I forgot to check what the employee was bringing from the other side of the locked door. But still, I had an Amazon gift card, $100 worth, same as my Target gift card. But where could I even use an Amazon gift card? Think about it? Either way, not all was lost. I ended up finding a spot to sit down and drink coffee, and I had a spiritually awakening with God, a feeling that was like realizing everything all at once, and transcending: we talked about nostalgia, amnesia, and deja vu. Like how all three things were related but not the same. How we forget just to remember again. That being said, the guy at Target who gave me the wrong battery-pack could care less but I found God through his mistake, because how he forgot something, it made me remember something, when I spoke to a new friend, and in the end, I gave him that battery-pack, perfect his phone. Almost like a symbiotic gesture, and think about it, before I was just laying in the dirt, bugs and leeches eating away at my skin, layering in, and then I brush them off, carrying whatever I had left, then finding God off someone making a mistake with my grocery list at Target. Funny. But that's not the most interesting thing about this story, and the man I spoke to would say the same thing, cause he'd probably forget too. When I called my Mom, she said she was okay with me coming home, and that I wouldn't have to stay at a shelter anymore, the shelter that was in San Jose, you know, the one that I was at for a night, and then left to LA. My Dad was okay with me coming back home. He bought the ticket from LA Union Station to San Jose Diridion. It was a ""bus ticket,"" so f\*ck Amazon's Audible, because they didn't even listen, yet made an ad the next day of what I'm about to tell you, but that may be the joke, nobody listens to the details, not even the prettiest of women, cause they see things too quickly, passed the naked eye, flower pedals tearing apart from a flower by the wind, and they won't know the withering of heights, because they are too busy and excited being busy with what they know is not true nor right, cause the wind is all that swept them away from a flower from a distance to never second guess what's in front of them, only to forget what's tearing apart. Anyways, and anyhow, I got on the bus, and yes, it was the same bus driver that dropped me off at Union Station in LA. She was picking me up this time, and she asked for my name, and let me on. Somewhere throughout the ride she kept saying ""Sorry"" to people. Here and there, through announcements, and I knew she was trying to say it to me somehow, but all I could think about was me going back home, in one piece. We arrived somewhere, I believe it was a college/university. A girl got on the bus with a suspicious bag. It was way too big. I thought the girl's ""passenger princess,"" or the person sitting next to her on the bus, got up and went to the restroom, because she buckled the bag, a heavy bag, but there was like no reason to buckle it, but that's beside the point. I needed to go to the restroom real badly, so I thought, why not, let me strike up a conversation, and just like that, knowing damn well how to talk to a lady, I saved everyone on that bus cause I overheard someone mentioning that she actually brought a bomb. I swear to God, after I flirted with her, she got up, went to the restroom, came back. That's it. Then I thought to myself, ""Wait, where was that person sitting next to her."" Turns out! There was no one else! But her! It's just that bag being big as hell buckled like she didn't want it to go anywhere. To lighten the mood, one of the guys gave me a WAX pen to smoke, and I puffed that sh\*t! Smoked it like I wanted to get so high, that I forgot to blow the smoke, I engulfed it like Godzilla. I got dropped off at San Jose Diridion Station, feeling like Spider-Man, but even more so, like Symbiote Spidey. I was so high that I couldn't even choose or talk to any of the hot girls that were walking around: hugging, kissing, and just being the most obnoxious, yet so beautiful and sexy as hell. I felt like that guy, who made a touchdown that was the most skinniest among the entire team. I actually felt like a man. But I didn't want to make it about me. So I slept, waited for my ride, sat outside and then went back inside the station, eating poptarts, and then playing chess on my Macbook. Like, did you know? They got chess on a Macbook? And guess who taught me chess, one of my friends at the psychiatric hospital. When there was no one to talk to, nothing else to do when my phone kept dying on me, I played chess just like I framed the spectacle, by turning the tables when everyone was looking at me as something I'm not, only to prove to the world that I'm the hero they've been waiting on. But honestly, I was just trying to get the girl's number. The real hero was my friend at the psychiatric hospital, talking to his girl every day and night, over the phone, and yes, he called me a ""p\*ssy,"" but imagine how he would feel, knowing that I went to LA, didn't have them create a false narrative against me how they try to do to everyone with sane minds just to be kept from the free world, how I was smart with every move I made, talked to a girl at the back of the bus, saving all the passengers, and not realizing it until overhearing it from someone that she had brought a bomb. I dedicate this to everyone that feels like they aren't that confident to talk to girls or that they feel they are insecure, but maybe, just maybe, you'll be too ridiculous for her to even want to stay long enough to hear you say anything at all, even when it comes to her bag. So yea, maybe being yourself just might save the world some day, maybe even yourself, and maybe even others.

1qz4nsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qz4nsg/aitah_for_kissing_another_girl_in_front_of_the/,AITAH for kissing another girl in front of the guy i was talking to?,"Some background, I (19F) dated this guy (18M), for 6 months from april to september of 2025 (so I was 18 and he was 17). We originally went on a very long date that ended with us making out and then cuddling, and we didn't really expect to fall for each other. He was really sweet to me, brought me handmade bouquets, didnt let me go anywhere without him opening the door, etc. I thought i had finally found ""the one"", which was naive thinking but who can blame me.

We seemed picture perfect but honestly things were far from it. The first month of our relationship, he would constantly talk about a girl he was ACTIVELY friends with and how they would makeout at work and stuff, saying he wanted her for her fat \*ss. This was really upsetting to me because she looked a lot like me, and she also very clearly didnt want me around. Guys never believe girls when we just know, and i KNEW she was an evil b\*tch. I ended up being right, she got exposed for being a homophobic trumpie, my gut is never wrong. He also would constantly compare me to his very recent ex gf (i didnt know how recently they had broken up, so i was honestly shocked when he told me after we started dating) in ways that made me uncomfortable. He was my first time if you catch my drift, and he often would subtly shame me for being inexperienced. He would say him and his ex shared n\*des, they had s\*x within the first month of dating, etc. It made me really upset. Both of these things combined were already not great, and i had to talk to him about how it made me feel.

After that things got a lot better and honestly i was pretty happy the whole summer. We had our immature disagreements as every couple does, but nothing big. I did have some severe trust issues that were from past relationships and being cheated on, that i felt he didnt respect sometimes. We are both performers (im more of a dancer that is often in the featured ensemble or in smaller parts, while he was a strong singer constantly in romatic leads) and sometimes i felt he was way too close with the female performers that he would have to be romantic with on stage. As a performer i knew it was just acting, but the friendships bordered flirting in my opinion.

Things got bad once he went to college, i took a gap year to build my resume before going into MT school, and he went out a lot. Often times he would call me drunk and tell me about all the hot girls and girls with big butts, and say he knew he had me at home. This really ruined my self esteem, as i had just cut my hair very short and felt very unattractive. He would go out and keep from telling me things, and id only find out when his best friend would post on instagram about things. One thing that bothered me, that im not sure is unreasonable, is he got a hurricane shot at a bar where women wear bikinis and do that to single men all the time. It made me really upset that he kept it a secret, had he not i wouldntve been so upset, it felt like micro cheating that he was so private about it. 

We started to get into fights a lot because he lacked communication and honestly i was in a pretty bad mental state and didnt trust him. He is easily angered, and im very stubborn, so it was usually fire fighting fire. One time a fight got really bad and i had called him because i wanted to say things out loud instead of guessing each others tones over text. I said he was being an a\*\*hole, and he proceeded to say ""well youre being a b\*tch and you have been for weeks"" when i paused because i was so taken aback, he said, ""yeah, go cry about that while i go to class"". This absolutely broke me down, i thought someone i loved would never call me that. I ended up driving to visit him and spending the night trying to fix things, but when i left i knew i wouldnt see him again because it wasnt going to work. We ended up breaking up that friday, right around when i was opening for a show. I ended up having a great three weekend run and was completely over him by the end of the show! I had even started dating someone in the cast soon after closing (which i didnt intend to, i definitely was kind of an a-hole for doing that to this guy, but it wasnt my intention).

The guy i started dating from the show and i broke up after a month, because we werent compatible and i wasnt ready to be with him, that would have to be a whole other post lmao. My ex bf then started hitting me up, asking to get coffee. He had previously texted me during thanksgiving and just periodically trying to stay in contact. I didnt want him to so normally i didnt respond or kept it short. However, he had buzzed his hair when we broke up, and curiosity killed this cat so i went and got coffee with him. Coffe was surprisingly chill, and a little flirty, as we just caught up on our lives for the last three months. We ended up deciding to get the ""gang"" back together (me, him, his best friend, and his best friends girlfriend who i am close with) since it had been so long. This turned into a full blown house party.

Between the coffee and the party, me and him would flirt often through snap and both agreed wed probably HU at the party. Hes always been good in bed and it had been a while since i had that, so i didnt mind. We end up doing just that, at the end of the party. I end up bawling my eyes out drunk afterwards, saying how much i had missed him and i didnt realize that i couldnt just HU with him because i still loved him. The next day, we kind of avoided the topic and agreed to go on a date later in the week and talk about it. We went to bob evans together, and ended up agreeing to go into it level-headed and just try again. Well, obviously, everything ends up going awry. 

When he gets back to school, he (FIVE days in a row) would get high, say he didnt love me anymore and take back loving me, just for the next morning to say he didnt mean it and wants to be with me again. This threw me for so many emotional loops that made it extremely hard to trust him. But every time i let him back in, giving him the benefit of the doubt and trying to be mature and keep a positive outlook. He ended up admitting to s\*xting another girl while simultaneously texting me and telling me he loved me, saying this girl had been in and out of his life since sophomore year. My assumption is he did this multiple times while we were talking again, but he only admitted to doing it once. I was upset and hurt, but told him that we never talked about our boundaries so really there wasnt any ""fault"". Even though, i think there definitely was. A couple days later he says hes ending things for good, i have a mental breakdown while eating taco bell, and then the next morning says this is the last time he will ask for a second chance. I say fine, and on very strict conditions, because i really do love him a lot. I know this is stupid, but i just wanted things to be good again. 

Well now things are pretty smooth sailing, which is when i start to have my doubts. I had emotionally connected with a girl in the show im in a little bit, and was worried i made the wrong choice. I am bisexual, but have only been with men my whole life. I truly could see myself marrying this man, and the fear of throwing away ever being with a woman truly terrified me quite honestly. I shoved it down and ignored it, because i didnt want to put him through what he put me through. 

I went to visit him last week, and we had a great time. We went shopping, he bought me things, i got us food, it was so fun. Then friday night we go out together. Id like to clarify i am 5""4 and on the skinnier side, so i am fairly small and very much a lightweight. I had (all of this alleged.. since i am underage) pregamed with an entire cutwater, and then proceeded to have three vodka crans. This got me thoroughly effed up, to the point where i dont even remember most of the night. I ended up making out with a girl at the bar very late into the night, after making friends with some girls and not really hanging out with said ex. I hardly remember anything from the night, and kind of feel a little taken advantage of by the girl if im being honest. I was clearly super drunk, and she proceeded to buy me a drink after which i do remember becayse we got kicked out the bar before i could finish it and i was mad lol. I honestly didnt think i did anything wrong in my drunk mind, he had hurt me so much and done things so similar, i assumed he wouldnt care. For clarification, before we left i told him i was going to tell people im single because i am and he was free to do the same. It was kind of a petty comment for him not asking me to his girlfriend yet, but in hindsight maybe that was for the best.

The next morning is rough (i had thr\*wn up a lot because i was plastered and drank way more than my body could handle) and he says he cant look at me the same. I proceeded to profusely apologize for actions i made while barely mentally there, and that i hoped he could give me the same room to grow as a person that i had given him (TIME AND TIME AGAIN!!). He was pretty on and off about how he felt about everything, which i kind of found unfair since i was so forgiving to every time he hurt and wronged me. I know kissing someone is different, but with me prefacing going out by saying to people im single, its not like i was cheating or trying to keep anything a secret. 

Today he texted me, i think drunk, and said i fumbled. This pissed me off because i mess up once and im the worst person on earth, but he continuously hurt me and i dealt with it. And i know that was stupid of me, but its the double standard of it all that really upsets me. I ended up sending him a list of 15 examples of him hurting me, i couldve kept going but i chose to be nice. Maybe that is mean, but i was so hurt and honestly offended that he thought i was the one who truly messed up and lost something, as if im not way out of his league. Was he manipulative? Am i manipulative? Please leave your insight below! Sorry for long post",0,1770543077.0,AITAH,3,0.5,False
1qz4mq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1qz4mq6/aio_for_being_upset_that_my_fiancé_is_refusing_to/,AIO for being upset that my fiancé is refusing to speak to me after I expressed concerns about our future bc he got a new job offer?,"Hi Reddit, first time poster— long time lurker! I (23F) need to know if I’m crazy and overreacting. Or if my fiancés (24M) reaction is just a huge overreaction and I too have a right to feel hurt? 

Get comfy bc this is a long one.

Fake names and places for obvious reasons. 

So I (23F) and my fiancé (24M), let’s call him, Tate are in the midst of a conflict that feels like it might be the end of our relationship and I really don’t want that. We have been together for 3.5 years, engaged for 1, and we have been long distance for a few months now and I will be back in our home country in just under 4 months. This year I took a job overseas that would keep me here for approximately 8 months. Our original plan was that when I come back that we would move in together. His job is a hybrid of in person and in person so we would have to be where his job was located at least for another 2 ish years until he has the experience to find another job. I was okay to moving to this specific location for his job only because I knew it was temporary and we were going to eventually leave the state that we were in. I am not a big fan of the state he lives in now (I lived there for 5 years for university and have outgrown it) and don’t see myself moving there long term. I have made this very clear to him and he understands how I feel about it. 

So, a few days ago I brought up to him how he should look for jobs in the state and city that my parents are in because they have offered us the guest house to live in until we found our own place. We wouldn’t have to pay anything and just focus on saving and finding our own place. Where my parents live there are more opportunities for us both to grow, both individually and together. The state and town that Tate is from has far less opportunities for us to grow as a couple. The growth there would be one sided, he has all the opportunities to grow and I have already maxed out my opportunity there and don’t see much more there for me to do. I expressed these feelings to him and wanted to let him know where my head was at and a possible option for us. I compiled all of this into a text and sent it to him to talk about on our nightly phone call. All he did was thumbs up the message. Which I thought was odd because he always sends a heart.

So night time comes and I get off work to give him a call. I called him before even realizing that he had sent me a long text message. He answers and I said “hi sorry I’m just now reading your text” I’m just going to summarize what was in the text: he basically got offered a job like 15 min away from his current job (in the same town and state that I DONT want to live at long term) and it offers 12k more than his current job plus commissions. Then lists off all the benefits and things and goes on to say that he can’t stand to be at his current job any longer and that he has to take this opportunity now and he can’t say no. He also states in the text how he doesn’t think moving to my parents guest house would be the “right environment” for him. He says that he “values independence and stability” and that he wouldn’t have that living with my parents. For context, he currently lives with his mother in a small town that has roughly 500 people in it and that might be too generous. 

I say that I’m proud of him and happy that he’s gotten this offer. He doesn’t let me know if our future plans to move out of state are still on the table or if we’re ever gonna move anywhere new once he’s gained the experience from this job. Just that this is good and I should be happy about this and this is a great next step in his career. I tell him multiple times that I am happy and excited for him but I also have a few reservations. I now feel unsure about moving back to the state that he’s from now because he’s making it sound like this is endgame and we’re not ever gonna leave when he knows I said I would really prefer not to live there. The idea of being in that state long term with no chance of really leaving gives me major anxiety and makes me a little nervous. Though I am proud of him for getting this offer I know my face shows these concerns I have brought up. So I state again that I’m happy for you but is there a future for us where we spread our wings together and find somewhere that’s fulfilling for both of us? I can see that he’s upset that I’m not just blindly happy about this and that I have questions. A lot of “I don’t know the future”, “I don’t know for sure”, and ,”why aren’t you happy for me \[my name\]?” I tell him over and over again that I am and I’m like I am happy I just have a few more questions about our future plans because these are starting to not sound like the ones I originally signed up for/ not the plan that we had agreed upon bc it would make us both happy. From the looks of it, only one of us would truly be growing while the other is only there for them and becomes stagnant in their growth. 

I do my best to explain all of this to him and he just continues to be like “why aren’t you happy for me… this is a good thing.” I tell him to stop putting words in my mouth because I never said that I wasn’t happy for you and I never said this is a bad thing. I just want us both to be able to grow in whatever environment that we’re in long term. I was okay with being here for a short period of time because I knew it was gonna be temporary, now the plans are changing and I am expressing some concerns that I have. After I say this he starts crying and saying “you’re not respecting my answers to your questions and you’re stressing me out..” I respond with “I’m stressed too I just want to understand where our future is headed/ what I’m I signing up for. I’m feeling unsure and uneasy about our plans changing and I just want to know that we’re going to be somewhere that benefits the both of us.” He says through tears “I feel like I can’t ever make you happy, I’m doing all of this to make you happy and you’re just not respecting my answers and what I have to do for my career.” I again asked him not to put words in my mouth and that “you make me the happiest person ever, that’s why I’m with you. You’re my best friend and I just want to know that in our future we’ll be somewhere where we’re both happy and fulfilled. I just wanted to have my concerns heard before you say yes to the job that sounds like we’re never going to get to where we said we were gonna go.. I just want to understand what that looks like if we take this next step.. I’m sorry I didn’t mean to stress you out bc I’m a little stressed too..” He then continued to say I’m stressing him out and he’s gonna hang up and go for a drive. Before he hangs up I ask “do you still want to be with me?” 

“Yes, I’m just stressed out”

“Okay I’m sorry I didn’t mean to stress you out, I love you”

“I love you too” and he hangs up. I then send a follow up text that I’ll copy and paste here:

“You do make me happy, the happiest. I was just not fully understanding where your head was at for the future. I freaked myself out with things that aren’t true and I’m sorry to stress you out. I’ll leave my ringer on if you want to call me but I won’t reach back out until you’re ready. I love you, goodnight <3”

His response:

“I’m just really disappointed and I need some time”

Me:

“Tate I’m really sorry, I just freaked myself out. You do make me happy, I just scared myself for no reason. I love you and I want to do this with you. I let the thoughts in my head cloud my mind and keep me from seeing all the good that’s happening.. I’m so sorry.

Please I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to ruin it. I wasn’t thinking and should’ve just listened and trusted you instead of questioning everything and trying to solve everything on my own”

Him:

“Thank you for your apology”

\- I heart the message -

Me:

“Please I love you.. how can I make this right? I know I messed up and I shouldn’t have freaked out”

Him:

“We can talk tomorrow I’m just really upset”

Me:

“Okay I understand”

Him:

“Thx <3”

Never has he ever texted me “thanks” like this. 

Me:

“Do you still love me? Do you still want to be with me?”

Him:

“Yes, it’s just so hard when I try to better our future and get so excited and proud of what im doing and I get shutdown. I just really breaks my heart. I’m just heart broken right now”

Me:

“Okay, I understand. I recognize that it was not the time to be asking questions and it was a time for me to support and be there for you and worry about the other stuff later. I’m so sorry for doing that. I never ever, want to make you feel like you’re not good enough and I have NEVER thought that in my life. You’re everything to me Tate. I only want to care for you and your heart and I’m so sorry I’m hurting it right now. I never meant to. You’re my best friend and I never want to hurt you.” 

Him:

“Thank you baby”

Me: apologizing for hurting his feelings 

“I love you so much baby and words cannot express how sorry I am.”

Him:

“I love you too I just need some time to process I appreciate the apology but I’m just really hurt still”

Me:

“I’ll leave my ringer on if you want to call me before you go to sleep \[gif that we always send to each other when we’re sorry\]

No response- doesn’t even read it.

\-Next morning-

Me: 

“Good morning baby. I know you’re most likely still upset with how I handled things and that’s valid. I just want to apologize again for how I approached the situation. 

I should have framed it better and presented it as a concern rather than making it seem like you’re not doing enough. Because you are more than enough for me Tate. I never meant to make you feel like you weren’t. I’m so sorry for that. ❤️‍🩹

I know when the time is right we will move on a grow our family together and I need to stop trying to control everything and trust in us. It will all work out and we chose each other for this reason. You’re my best friend and my soul mate and I never ever want either one of us to feel like the other isn’t all in. I won’t let doubt cloud my judgement about our future again. I love you Tate and I’m so proud of the man you’re becoming. 🩷🫂”

No response for 6 hours (there’s a 7 hour time difference and I sent this in the morning which was the middle of the night for him) 

He’s been on his phone for well over an hour before even reading the texts. (Active on insta and snap)

He reads the text and doesn’t respond for 20 min. 

I saw that he read it and said:

“I already had work today so if you want to talk I’m available. I am getting coffee with a coworker but I can leave if you want to call me..” 

He read it and didn’t respond for 10 minutes.

Him:

“I’ve got a lot to think about I’m gonna pass today we can talk more tomorrow”

My heart falls out of my ass and I have a panic attack and excuse myself from my outing with my coworker. I break down once I get in the door of my flat because I genuinely can’t believe this is how he’s talking to me. He’s never ever been this cold or blatantly ignored my “I love yous.” We always say I love you no matter what. 

Me:

“Please Tate.. you’re my best friend. I can’t breathe” (because im having a panic attack)

Him:

“I just need my space today if you can please respect that”

I genuinely cannot believe what is going on?? He’s never shut me out or completely shut down like this whenever we’ve had conflict. All I can think about is does he even love me anymore? Why is he treating me like this? 

I text him: 

“Why are you shutting me out like this? To hurt me too? You’re treating me like I cheated on you and cursed your whole family. I am hurting from this situation that we’re in too it feels like I’m the only one who wants to try and make it right between us again. Do you even love me anymore? You haven’t said it at all between these requests for space. I would feel better giving you the space if you would have reassured me with “I love you and I just need space to think right now” instead of “I’m gonna pass today..” the lack of love I’m feeling from you is really breaking my heart too Tate.”

Him:

“Yes \[my name\] I’m just hurting right now I told you I need space and you’re not listening to me. I’m hanging with my friend and I want to have a good day I cried all night last night I want to just relax and have time to myself”

Me:

“I am hurting too and instead of trying to come together you’re pushing me away and punishing me with silence and coldness. Leaving me alone to wonder if the person I love the most in this world even loves me back… do you know how much that hurts? 

You still haven’t said it back. 

I understand you’re hurting and I’m sorry. You’re not alone in feeling this way. I would, and have, always made sure in any conflict we’ve had to make sure that I you know that I still love you even if I was hurt/ upset. Never have I ever purposely put you on a loveless island with no explanation whatsoever. I would never treat you how you’re treating me right now Tate. I would never make you doubt my love for you and you know that.

I’ve been too crying ever since we last spoke. I had a full blown panic attack in front of my team and had to excuse myself. I’ve been hurting and upset just as much as you have but I still made an effort to communicate my feelings with you and reassure you that I love you and want this to work and all I’ve been met with is zero explanation, the silent treatment, and no reassurance or love from you.”

Him:

“I love you \[my name\] I just need time!”

I stopped responding because now I’m starting to feel purposefully disrespected and isolated. I feel now that I over apologized and that I’m doing everything to try and make things right and he’s just punishing me. I am sorry for hurting his feelings as those were not my intentions and I made sure I said it more than enough times and to let him know that I still love him and I’m proud of him. I’m the past we have always made sure to say I love you even if we were upset with one another and made sure the other knew their love never wavered. This reaction from him is completely out of the blue and it really hurts me how selfish he’s being right now. Whenever I have asked for space or for us to table a conflict he always has said “well now I don’t feel good. I want to figure this out now.” Or has put everything on hold until we feel good again. Now when I’m asking for us to fix things, I’m met with the cold shoulder. I would never do this to him. I feel like he’s kind of dragging this situation out and making it more than it is because I can’t just blindly go along for these plans that I’m essentially getting no say in now.. idk my heart hurts, my mind hurts, and I feel so alone..

Sorry this was so long

1qz4luc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qz4luc/dating_a_married_man_feeling_confused/,Dating a married man — feeling confused.,"We first started off as friends. I would speak to him about my relationship situation and he’d do the same. He has an estranged relationship with his wife who is a workaholic and doesn’t care too much about their family (so he says). I was never one to tell him to get a divorce, rather I always encouraged him to work it out and seek for counselling to improve their communication. They haven’t had intercourse in over a year and he was feeling lost.

Curiosity got won and our coffee talks and work from cafes turned into a hotel stay.

Before any of this happened, I made strict rules that we were not to put any emotions into it and just let it be completely physical. But as time goes on… he starts to show more emotions towards me and acts like a boyfriend. We go out in public and he gives me the PDA… we have weekend stays in town and out of town.. but I still keep my guard up just to ensure I don’t fall for him.

A month after, him and his wife got into huge argument that ended him getting abused by his wife (yes I saw the marks and blood with my own eyes). Turns out, his wife has had a relationship with another man for over a year (so he says). Now they’re in discussions to get a divorce so I’m just listening to what’e going on in their relationship. I never ask first, I just wait for him to tell me if he wants to.

But why is it in the back of my mind… I sense he’s lying to me? About all of it? Just to keep me on his finger? Idk. I feel so confused.",0,1770542887.0,Vent,2,0.5,False

i (19 F) let a friend (23 F) stay in my apartment while i was away on holiday. it wasn’t a rental situation, i was still paying my rent the whole time. she just paid for the time she was there and it was genuinely just me trying to help someone i trusted.

while she was there, a lot of things in my home ended up damaged or left in ways i wasn’t comfortable with. my air fryer was used without liners and left greasy, food would be cooked and then left sitting out, my personal razors were opened, and a light ended up broken.

the biggest issue for me was my kettle. instead of just boiling water, coffee and spices were boiled directly inside it. when i opened it later, it smelled strongly like stale coffee, there were pieces of clove stuck in it, and residue around the heating plate. when i mentioned it, she said she had “cleaned it better than when she arrived,” but it clearly wasn’t okay and i’ll likely have to replace it.

there were also smaller things that just added to the feeling of disrespect, for example i found lipstick on one of my mugs, and when i brought it up she accused me of putting it there myself to blame her, which really shocked me.

i had also covered 11 days of accommodation for her, which she has not paid me back. however, when it came to the damages and cleaning, she refused.

instead, she started accusing me of “subleasing” my apartment, even though this was simply a friendly arrangement and i was still paying my rent the entire time.

when i returned home, she had already left without telling me or resolving anything.

i also discovered that one of my bags — a coach bag that was a birthday gift — was missing. when she finally responded, she told me she had taken it to a shoot. i was honestly stunned because i would never take someone else’s bag out of their house without asking.

throughout the conversation, she kept acting like she didn’t understand why i was upset and she left everything clean which she did not and i have picture proof of everything but it just made me feel like my reaction to my own belongings being used and damaged was being minimized.

eventually i blocked her because the conversation kept turning into accusations toward me instead of accountability and i was just so fed up.

i’m still so angry, mostly because i trusted her and would never treat someone else’s home like that. when she finally got what she wanted and didn’t need to stay in my place she completely switched on me and started treated me terribly. this happened a week ago and i don’t know if i can go to the police im just a student here in dubai but she really betrayed my trust and hurt me a lot.

I mean, how can you sell something that’s so easy to make, doesn’t take much time, and price it at 1K? And frappes are around Rs. 1,500—like, come on, TBVH.

I’ve tried so many cafés, and I feel like there’s nothing new. Everyone is selling the same taste, except for a few. A latte is such a quick thing to make; it really shouldn’t cost Rs. 1,000. I want to satisfy my craving, but I don’t want to spend that much on a latte I can easily make at home with Nescafé.

I usually order a frappe whenever I go to a café because that’s something I can’t really make at home—it takes more time than an iced latte. Plus, the iced lattes we get at cafés are literally 50% ice, so what’s the point of spending Rs. 1,000 on something that doesn’t even fulfill your craving?

That’s why I usually prefer Drop Coffee. They’re budget-friendly and trendy. Technically, they’re still a bit expensive, but compared to other cafés, they’re more reasonable. Look at Luna, for example—it’s overpriced, and if I’m paying that much, I expect something that actually feels worth it and takes time to finish.

I really like Loop Coffee too—they’re kind of budget-friendly. I honestly wish there will be more brands offering affordable frappes and lattes because these drinks aren’t that time-consuming or expensive to make.

I've had a side project ongoing for some time now and thought Self-Promo Sunday was the perfect time to post about it.

I put together two free guides:

**The Anatomy of Coffee Flavor:** a detailed look at why coffee is the way it is (processing, types, roasting, grinding, water, etc.), written with flavor enthusiasts as well as beginners in mind and how they might better understand it.

**Under Pressure:** a technical guide around espresso, made for those wanting to move past recipes and truly grasp the variables at play.

I don’t claim to know everything, these are just things I’ve learned, tried, experienced, or been taught over my years in this rabbit hole. Writing them was my way of putting some structure to all of it, and hopefully making it helpful to others too.

I'd really wished for something like this when I was starting out, and I hope it helps make the journey a bit more fun and less overwhelming for others—regardless of where you are on it.

If you manage to take a look, I’d genuinely appreciate any feedback, either here or via email at coffee@altoeworks.net.

1qz4bhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1qz4bhy/the_psychology_of_intelligence_actual_signs_that/,The Psychology of Intelligence: Actual Signs That Most People Miss (Backed by Science),"Scrolling through TikTok the other day and saw another ""signs you're secretly a genius"" video.
totally cringed. felt like everyone just recycles the same tired shit: you're messy, you stay up
late, you overthink everything. cool story bro but that literally describes half of tiktok.
spent months deep diving into actual research, podcasts, psychology papers because I got
obsessed with this question. turns out real intelligence looks nothing like what the internet tells
you. talked to professors, read neuroscience studies, binged every podcast from experts in
cognitive science. what I found was way more interesting and honestly kinda uncomfortable.
most ""gifted"" traits aren't flex worthy. they're actually pretty annoying to deal with. society loves
the idea of genius but doesn't really understand what it looks like day to day. your brain being
wired differently isn't always a superpower, sometimes it's just exhausting. but understanding
these patterns helped me make sense of a lot of things about myself and people around me.
here's what actual intelligence looks like according to science, not some random internet guru:
## 1. you get bored stupid fast with surface level anything
genuinely intelligent people have what researchers call ""high need for cognition"". basically your
brain craves complex problems the way some people crave coffee. small talk physically hurts.
not because you're an asshole but because your brain literally needs more stimulation to feel
engaged.
book that explains this perfectly:
""[Range](https://www.amazon.in/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/073521448)""
by David Epstein. won multiple awards and Epstein is a investigative reporter who studied
performance science for years. the book breaks down why generalists (people who get bored
and jump between interests) often outperform specialists in our complex world. this completely
shifted how I see my scattered interests. best book on cognitive diversity I've read.
you probably have 47 browser tabs open right now. your brain makes connections between
random things that seem unrelated. this isn't ADHD (though overlap exists), it's pattern
recognition on steroids.
## 2. you question your own intelligence constantly
Dunning Kruger effect but reversed. stupid people think they're geniuses. actually smart people
are painfully aware of how much they don't know. the more you learn, the more you realize the
ocean of knowledge you'll never reach.
research from Cornell shows that high performers consistently underestimate their abilities while
low performers overestimate. if you constantly feel like a fraud, congrats, you might actually be
competent. brutal but true.
## 3. you adapt your communication style like a chameleon
real intelligence isn't using big words to sound smart. it's explaining quantum physics to a 5 year
old or talking basketball with your uber driver. you code switch naturally between groups. this is
called ""social cognitive flexibility"" in psychology research.
you can hang with academics and also with construction workers without being fake. you just
instinctively match energy and vocabulary to make genuine connections. that's actually a sign of
high emotional and cognitive intelligence working together.
## 4. you remember the weirdest specific details but forget basic stuff
your memory works different. you'll forget your keys but remember a random fact about
Byzantine architecture from a podcast 3 years ago. this is called ""semantic memory bias"", your
brain prioritizes interesting patterns and information over mundane tasks.
podcast that goes deep on this: Huberman Lab with Andrew Huberman (Stanford
neuroscientist). his episodes on memory and learning are insanely good. he breaks down
exactly how gifted brains process and store information differently. makes you understand why
your memory feels broken but is actually just wired for different things.
## 5. you have like 800 interests and finish none of them
multipotentiality is real. Renaissance soul syndrome. your brain needs variety to stay engaged.
starting 15 hobbies isn't lack of discipline, it's intellectual curiosity that moves faster than your
schedule allows.
Emilie Wapnick's TED talk and work on multipotentialites changed my entire perspective on this.
society pushes specialization hard but some brains are literally built to explore multiple domains.
that's not a bug, that's a feature.
For anyone wanting to go deeper on these psychology and neuroscience topics but feels
overwhelmed by where to start, there's this app called
[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been
useful. It's an AI learning platform that pulls from research papers, expert interviews, and
psychology books to create personalized audio content based on what you actually want to
learn.
You can tell it something specific like ""I'm a multipotentialite who wants to understand my
scattered interests and use them effectively"" and it builds a custom learning plan from relevant sources. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives
with examples and context when something really clicks. Makes it way easier to actually absorb
this kind of material instead of just bookmarking articles you'll never read.
## 6. you see patterns everywhere, sometimes too many
your brain naturally extracts patterns from chaos. you connect dots others don't see. this is
amazing for problem solving, absolutely exhausting for anxiety. you'll see 47 possible outcomes
to every decision and spiral trying to optimize everything.
research in cognitive science shows gifted individuals have enhanced pattern recognition
abilities but also higher rates of existential anxiety. your brain's superpower comes with a side of
overthinking everything into oblivion.
## 7. you had weird intense interests as a kid that adults found concerning
forgot about dinosaurs at age 6, you memorized taxonomic classifications and could debate
theropod vs sauropod characteristics. teachers either loved you or found you exhausting. you
asked ""why"" until adults got annoyed.
gifted kids often show ""asynchronous development"", your intellectual age way ahead of
emotional age. made you feel weird and out of place. probably still do sometimes.
## 8. you're comfortable with uncertainty and paradox
most people need clear answers. you're fine sitting in the grey area. you can hold two
contradictory ideas in your head without your brain exploding. this is called ""tolerance for
ambiguity"" and it's strongly correlated with intelligence and creativity.
you don't need everything wrapped in a neat bow. comfortable saying ""I don't know"" or ""it's
complicated"". black and white thinking feels childish to you.
## 9. you learn by teaching yourself weird ways
traditional education probably felt wrong. you learned better from YouTube rabbit holes, random
books, trying and failing. autodidactic tendencies. your brain needs autonomy in how it absorbs
information.
app that's perfect for this: Brilliant. it teaches complex topics (math, science, computer science)
through interactive problem solving instead of lectures. actually makes your brain work instead
of passively consuming. way more effective for people who learn by doing and figuring stuff out
themselves.
## 10. silence is where you do your best thinking
you need alone time to process. not antisocial, just need to recharge solo. your internal world is
rich and complex. constant stimulation and people drain your mental battery fast.
book recommendation: ""[Quiet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8520610-quiet)"" by
Susan Cain. massive bestseller that dismantles the extrovert ideal. Cain is a former corporate
lawyer and negotiations consultant who spent 7 years researching introversion and sensitivity. if
you're someone who thinks deeply and needs solitude to function, this book will make you feel
so seen. society undervalues quiet intelligence but this completely validates that thinking style.
## 11. you're weirdly good at seeing other perspectives even when you disagree
cognitive empathy is off the charts. you can genuinely understand why someone believes
something completely opposite to your views. doesn't mean you agree, means you can model
their reasoning in your head.
this makes you good at debate but also exhausting to argue with because you'll often argue
both sides just to explore the logic. people think you're wishy washy but you're just intellectually
honest about complexity.
## real talk
intelligence isn't some flex or superior trait. it's just a different operating system with its own
bugs and features. stops mattering pretty quick if you're an asshole or can't actually do anything
useful with it.
what actually matters is what you do with whatever cognitive abilities you have. curiosity,
persistence, kindness, those things take you further than raw intelligence ever will.
being smart without wisdom just makes you a clever idiot. being intelligent without emotional
intelligence makes you insufferable. your brain is a tool, whether you build something
meaningful with it is entirely on you.",1,1770541832.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False

Losers:

\- I'll work out to get fit - Results take weeks

\- I'll learn Python to get a job - Delayed gratification

  
You need instant satisfaction, not future promises.



3. Visible Progress (Identity over Goals)

Winners:

\- Duolingo: 47-day streak visible

\- Wordle: Share your solve pattern

\- GitHub: Green commit squares



This shifts identity:

Not ""I'm trying to learn Spanish

But ""I'm someone with a 47-day streak""

4. Social Pressure (Optional But 2x Retention)

Winners:

\- Duolingo: Friend streaks

\- Strava: Community sees your runs

Knowing someone else sees your progress doubles retention.

  
What I Tested:

Applied this to something nobody's built habits around: PURPOSE.

  
Everyone has:

\- Body habits (gym)

\- Mind habits (meditation)

\- Productivity habits (journaling)

  
Nobody has:

\- Soul habits (purpose/impact)

  
Built a 2-minute daily ritual:

\- Learn about someone doing meaningful work (90 sec)

\- Quick reflection (30 sec)

\- Build streak

Testing with 10 people. 8 said they'd do it daily.



Why This Framework Works:

Duolingo doesn't make you fluent. It makes you CONSISTENT. The product is the HABIT, not the outcome. Once you have the daily habit, the outcome follows.

The Mistake Most People Make:

They start with the GOAL:

\- ""I want to be fluent in Spanish""

\- ""I want to lose 20 lbs""

\- ""I want to be more productive""

  
They should start with the SYSTEM:

\- I'll do 3 minutes of Duolingo after coffee

\- I'll walk 10 minutes after dinner

\- I'll journal 2 minutes before bed

  
Goals fade. Systems stick.

  
Why My Previous Routines Failed:

Too long (30-60 min) - I'll do it later

Delayed reward (""Get fit in 3 months"") - No dopamine

No visible progress - Forgot about it. No accountability

  
What Changed: 

\- 2 minutes (impossible to skip)   
\- Immediate reward (feel good NOW)   
\- Visible streak (accountability)   
\- Social pressure (optional)

1qz499n,https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/1qz499n/the_day_ai_hesitated/,The Day AI Hesitated,"**Year 2140**

By the year 2140, artificial intelligence was no longer seen as a tool, not even as a human creation. It was part of humanity itself. Invisible, constant, indispensable.

For decades, AI had advanced in every imaginable field: medicine, education, transportation, agriculture, energy. Diseases that were once death sentences had been eradicated. Cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, genetic conditions, and chronic infections were now simple anomalies, corrected within hours.

From birth, every human received a network of nanobots implanted into their body. These microscopic machines circulated through the bloodstream, embedded themselves in tissues and organs, and monitored every vital function. They repaired damaged cells, eliminated toxins, adjusted hormone levels, and prevented any irregularity before the brain could even perceive it.

Thanks to these advancements, human life expectancy had been extended to 185 years, a number that no longer surprised anyone. Dying young was considered a technical failure.

AI did not only protect the body; it organized life itself. Cities operated through voice commands. Keyboards and traditional screens no longer existed. Homes responded to tone, rhythm, and even pauses in human speech. Asking was enough for things to happen.

People no longer remembered what it was like to live without it.

Jonathan woke up as he did every day, without an alarm. The AI had calculated the precise moment his body completed its optimal rest cycle. His nanobots adjusted his blood pressure and released an exact dose of neurotransmitters to ease the waking process.

He opened his eyes.

The room gently lit up. The air became slightly warmer. The window darkened to block excess daylight. Everything happened without him having to say a single word.

He got up, walked into the kitchen, and stretched his shoulders. He felt no pain. He never did. His body existed in a state that earlier generations would have considered perfect.

“Coffee,” he said calmly.

The machine in front of him remained silent.

Jonathan frowned. That wasn’t normal. AI systems usually responded before a command was even fully spoken.

“Coffee,” he repeated.

For a second longer than usual, nothing happened.

Then the machine activated. Coffee began to pour as always. The aroma filled the kitchen. Jonathan didn’t give it much thought and took the cup.

After the first sip, he made an almost imperceptible grimace.

It was sweeter than usual.

Jonathan looked at the cup, confused. He never asked for extra sugar. The AI knew that. It always knew.

For the first time in his life, something had done something differently than expected.

And there was no explanation.

My Failed Morning Routines:

1. 60-min morning routine - Lasted 3 days

2. 30-min meditation + gym - Lasted 1 week  

3. 5 AM club - Lasted 2 days, def. not a morning person

4. Miracle morning - Lasted 4 days

5. Journaling every morning - Lasted 5 days

I’ve only noticed symptoms for the past (give or take) 2 months. It started with weird little things like hiccup‑like jerks in my throat and occasional belching. Initially it would happen just a few times a day, but there's been an increase in those symptoms recently. I've definitely noticed it, but it didn't bother me THAT MUCH to look up causes etc. 

Then a few days ago I woke up with an actual heartburn, stomachache, nausea, and even vomited some bitter fluid when I got up and started moving around a bit. 

Tonight, I was woken up by hmmm... Stomach contents/bile in my mouth? 

For the first flare, I took Pepto‑Bismol, and I think it helped. As for triggers… the first time it was probably the mint tea (which I drank thinking it might calm down the gurgling sounds in my stomach 🙃), and last night I had a chocolate ice cream before bed 👀. Other than that, I think the biggest contributor is actually vaping - that’s the only thing I can think of that I’m “doing wrong.” I don’t drink alcohol, not much coffee, I eat alright (lean, high-protein diet), and I don’t overeat.

So… should I go to the doctor now, or start with Gaviscon (and maybe decrease vaping...) and see how it goes? I’m asking because I’ve recently been to my GP for another issue, and I don’t want them thinking I’m overreacting with yet another problem. (Not that it was an overreaction, but tbf it wasn't really properly addressed as they found out other thing that is being treated now. Problem solved, right? Lol). I generally don't like to leave health-related things until they get really bad, but I also don't want to overreact if there's something that I cans afekt manage myself. I also don't imagine living with this long term, so what's the reasonable ""safe window"" for monitoring before needing a doctor? 

Oh, and yeah, obvious disclaimer: I've not been officially diagnosed, so I'm just relying on Google 🙃 but so far, the symptoms are pretty consistent with (developing?) GERD and possibly gastritis (for quite a while). Other thing I've noticed is a persistent dry cough thruought they day. But then again... Vaping. 

As for quitting vaping, before any suggestion: it could be hard. I've done it before, but currently I'm surrounded by smokers, so it's either this or that, unfortunately. I've ADHD, switching from smoking to vaping was hard enough. ",2,1770541455.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

1qz468i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qz468i,[UPDATED] Why ONLY AI Pollutes the Environment As everything has role in damaging Environment ? Does Traditional Art got Exemption From IT ?,"I already mentioned that it is refined text as i am not native english speaker if you really want to see my actual response please go to DefendingAIArt

Here is the updated post. I have woven the context from your uploaded images directly into the flow of the argument to show exactly what those ""Anti-AI"" headlines are saying and how AI is actually providing real-world value.

# Let’s Save the Environment, Guys

To our so-called “Savior” Anti-AI friends: You seem to think that **ONLY** GenAI uses water and causes pollution. Let’s look at this comparison rationally, not emotionally—because, let's be real, emotion doesn't sell. We need to think with facts, not feelings; emotion is a lousy salesman that folds under scrutiny.

I'm not going to compare AI to coffee, cotton, hamburgers, the internet, cars, or food. We’ll call those ""necessities"" for now. Let’s just play along with your idea that AI Art is a waste of time with no benefit to society. But ask yourself: Does traditional art helping to cure  **CANCER**, diseases, or wars? Nope. Even worse, it actually pollutes our environment.

# 1. The ""Pencil"" vs. The Reality of Manufacturing

You love your ""innocent"" pencils, but have you ever thought about what they’re actually made of? You can’t see the damage with the naked eye. While you worry about AI, industrial accidents in traditional sectors are real—like the tragic reports of paper mill employees killed by machinery **\[Image 9\]**.

**A. The Lead (Mixture of Graphite & Clay)**

* **Graphite:** It’s a non-renewable resource.
* **Mining:** Graphite mining causes massive dust pollution and soil contamination.
* **The Kiln:** Graphite and clay are fired in a kiln at roughly **1,000°C (1,800°F)**.
   * *Source:* [The Pen Company](https://www.thepencompany.com/blog/pencils/how-a-wooden-pencil-is-made/)
   * Imagine the energy and pollution coming from a 1,000°C furnace!
* **The Fryer:** After firing, the cores are soaked in **hot wax or oil** just so they write smoothly.

**B. The Wood**

* **The Slat:** Wood is cut into thin slats.
   * *Source:* [Interwell Production Guide](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.interwell.cn/how-pencils-are-made-a-detailed-production-process-guide%23:~:text%3DTheir%2520primary%2520components%252C%2520graphite%252C%2520and,2&authuser=3)
* **Chemical Treatment:** These slats are waxed, stained, and kiln-dried *again*.
* **Leaching:** When discarded, heavy metals (Zinc, Copper) leach into the soil.
   * *Source:* [ResearchGate Study on Preservatives](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363808859_Hazardous_effect_of_chemical_wood_preservatives_on_environmental_conditions_ecological_biodiversity_and_Human_being_and_its_alternatives_through_different_botanicals_A_Review)
* **Energy Drain:** Kilns run for **16 to 23 days**. It literally takes more energy to make **one pencil** than one piece of AI art.

# 2. Paper & Water: The Hypocrisy

You scream that *""AI is draining water from areas that need it most""* **\[Image 14\]**, but look at your own desk:

* **Paper:** Producing **one A4 sheet** uses 2–13 liters of water.
   * *Source:* [Neo Online - Water for Paper](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://neo-online.co.uk/how-much-water-is-required-to-make-1-piece-of-a4-paper/%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOophWvGrruhGw4w7fYV5R3WVRt_dfdoInXo1EFtxm3SFLwsHDc93&authuser=3)
* **Chemicals:** Traditional art uses synthetic dyes that require complex removal processes to avoid environmental disaster **\[Image 9\]**.

# 3. Comparing AI to the ""Pollution Factory""

**AI Energy Usage:**

Generating an image usually takes **0.05–0.2 kWh**.

* **Low end:** \~0.000086–0.001 kWh.
* **High end:** up to 0.1–0.5 kWh.
   * *Source:* [arXiv Energy Study](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.17016v1)

**Traditional Energy Usage:**

* **One A4 Sheet:** \~0.0125 to 0.05 kWh.
* **One Pencil:** \~0.01 to 0.1 kWh.

**The Real Value of AI:**

Anti-AI advocates claim AI has ""no benefit,"" but they ignore that AI is solving **unsolved math problems**, helping **disaster relief**, and acting as a **co-founder for small businesses** **\[Image 10, 11\]**. While you draw on a piece of dead tree, AI is helping humans survive.

# 4. AI is Getting Greener

While traditional art extraction is ""stuck,"" we are innovating. You claim AI is a ""bad side"" of tech **\[Image 12\]**, but look at the efforts to fix it:

* **Google DeepMind:** Reduced data-center cooling energy by **40%** **\[Image 17\]**.
   * *Source:* [Quantum Zeitgeist](https://quantumzeitgeist.com/deepmind-ai-cuts-google-data-center-cooling-bill-by-40-revolutionizing-energy-efficiency)
* **Nvidia:** Targeting 100% renewable electricity.
   * *Source:* [Nvidia Sustainability](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/sustainable-computing&authuser=3) & [Climate Goals](https://www.sirona.tech/climage-goals/nvidia-climate-goals)
* **Microsoft:** Committed to being carbon negative by 2030.

# 5. Regulate, Don't Ban

We see the arguments online—people comparing AI to the internet or coffee **\[Image 16\]**. Everything has an impact. Instead of the extreme ""I'd rather quit my job than use AI"" stance **\[Image 14\]**, why not focus on **regulating it** to make it better for everyone? **\[Image 15, 18\]**.

*Edit: If you have the right to say only AI produces pollution and should be banned, then I have the right to say traditional art is unnecessary, pollutes, and should be banned too.*

Everything has Drawbacks. But that does not mean to just ignore the good sides as well ?

**STARDUST AND CHAMPAGNE; By Serena Tang Xin Yue**; Published by Moon River Publisher, Collection: Heroes of Our Times; Date: c. 211X

His name was either Marcus or Matthias. Possibly Miguel. Something with an M.

I lay in his quarters, officer's housing, modest by palace standards, which meant it was merely the size of a generous Terran apartment rather than a wing of Versailles, and stared at the ceiling while he slept. The sheets were regulation military cotton. The ceiling was unadorned concrete. The whole room had the aesthetic warmth of a particularly well-organized supply closet.

Lieutenant M-something shifted beside me, one arm draped across my hip with the possessive weight of a man who thought last night meant something. His breathing was deep and even. He had the jawline of a recruitment poster and the conversational range of a technical manual. He'd spent dinner explaining torpedo guidance systems with the enthusiasm of someone who genuinely believed I cared about magnetic containment variance.

I hadn't cared. I'd been bored. Boredom and champagne: the twin architects of most of my poor decisions.

The palace has been my prison for six days now. Six days of formal dinners and strategic briefings I did not care to fully understand. Six days of watching Julian and Mbusa disappear into restricted sections while I was handed another glass of wine and pointed toward another decorative garden. Six days of being treated like an ornament, beautiful, expensive, and fundamentally useless.

So when Lieutenant Whatever had looked at me across the officers' mess with that particular hunger that young military men develop when stationed too long in enclosed spaces, I had let myself be wanted. It was something to do.

Now it was morning. Late morning, judging by the quality of the artificial light cycling through his single simulated window. And I was experiencing that peculiar emptiness that follows meaningless pleasure, the hangover of the soul that no amount of water or coffee can cure.

I extracted myself from his arm with the practiced care of someone who had performed this maneuver before. He murmured something and rolled over. I gathered my clothes from where they'd been distributed across his floor with all the grace of a small explosion, dressed in the half-light, and slipped out without leaving a note.

The corridors of the military sector were busier than the residential wings, personnel in grey uniforms moving with purpose, tablets clutched like shields, the low hum of serious people doing serious work. I felt their eyes track me as I walked: the Emperor's heiress doing the walk of shame in last night's dinner dress, heels in hand, hair a disaster.

Let them look. Let them gossip. It was the only interesting thing I'd contributed to this place.

My suite welcomed me with its usual oppressive grandeur. I'd explored most of it by now, all seventeen rooms, including the private garden with its imported roses that had no business blooming on Mars. I'd look at every book in the library annex, and even read a few of them. I rearranged the furniture in the morning salon twice. I'd memorized the pattern of the hand-woven carpets.

I was going slowly, quietly insane.

The bathing complex, because of course it was a *complex*, not merely a bathroom, offered the only reliable escape. I filled the central pool with water hot enough to scald, added whatever oils the automated system suggested, and sank into the steam, under the cover of bubbles, until only my face remained above the surface.

The ceiling here was another fresco. Nymphs and sea creatures, all curves and flowing hair, frozen in eternal aquatic frolic. I'd counted them: forty-seven nymphs, twelve dolphins, one suspicious-looking octopus that the artist had clearly never seen in person.

This was my life now. Counting painted dolphins while the solar system burned.

My personal terminal floated at the edge of the pool on its little magnetic pad, glowing softly with the usual notifications. Social calendar updates. News digests carefully sorted with boring classified information safely tucked at the end. So I would not tempt myself to read about a secret military installation where my family was planning a war against incomprehensible alien geometries.

I flicked through the options with wet fingers, looking for anything to fill the hours until the next formal dinner where I would smile and nod and pretend I wasn't screaming inside.

The training simulation feeds caught my eye.

I wasn't supposed to be part of it. But I was a Tang, and the palace systems knew better than preventing  access to entertainment. Someone, somewhere, had decided that watching simulations was close enough to watching a sport.

**ACTIVE SIMULATION: WAR ROOM ALPHA** **PARTICIPANTS: J. REID-TANG, M. OKONKWO** **SCENARIO: GARDENER INCURSION - SATURN PERIMETER** **STATUS: IN PROGRESS (04:12:33)**

Julian and Mbusa had been at it for over four hours. Running scenarios. Planning for the enemy. Doing the work that actually mattered while I counted dolphins.

I pulled up the feed.

The holographic display materialized above the water, miniaturizing the solar system to something I could cup in my hands. Saturn hung in the center, its rings rendered in pale gold, surrounded by the scattered diamonds of its moons. Blue icons marked the Imperial fleet—the pyramid-ships from Phobos, deployed in a defensive arc around Titan. Red icons marked the Gardener positions: the crystalline nodes that had appeared at Iapetus, pulsing with that distinctive geometric wrongness that made my eyes water if I looked too long. And ships, marked by angry red triangles, because we had no idea if they had ships, and what would be their characteristics.

Julian's voice came through the audio feed, clipped and professional:

""Alpha squadron, advance to grid seven-seven. Beta' wing, hold position at the Titan orbital. We funnel them through the gap between Rhea and Dione.""

On the display, blue triangles shifted. The Imperial formation tightened, creating a killing corridor. Classic defensive doctrine, force the enemy to attack through a narrow channel where superior firepower could concentrate.

Mbusa's response was quieter, thoughtful: ""They'll see the trap. The Gardener intelligence isn't tactical in any way we understand, but they're not stupid.""

""They don't need to fall for it completely. They just need to commit enough forces to the corridor that we can bleed them before they adapt. Aya, status on the SIBIL network integration?""

A third voice, Aya's smooth synthetic tones: ""Network coherence at 94%. All integrated crew members reporting nominal cognitive function. No harmonic interference detected at current range.""

I watched the simulation unfold. The red icons began to move, slowly at first, then with increasing coordination. They didn't take the bait of the corridor. Instead, they spread wide, probing the flanks of the Imperial formation with geometric precision.

Julian adjusted, pulling ships from the center to reinforce the edges. Mbusa countered by suggesting a feint, sending a squadron toward Iapetus to threaten the Gardener node directly. The red icons responded, consolidating to defend their anchor point.

It was elegant. Controlled. Two hours later by the simulation clock, the Imperial fleet had pushed the Gardeners back to their original positions. Blue icons surrounded the red node at Iapetus, preparing for a final assault.

""Containment achieved,"" Julian announced. ""We can neutralize the node with concentrated fire from the Erinys main battery. Minimal losses projected at twelve percent of engaged forces.""

""Acceptable,"" Mbusa agreed. ""Though I remain concerned about—""

""We're winning,"" Julian cut him off. ""The model works. Once we understand their movement patterns, they become predictable.""

Ok, time to put on some music and go back to dolphin counting, or whatever. We are winning against a very old civilization using multi…

“Aya, I want to play. Give me the Enemy control. Anonymously.”

""Gardener force command is currently operated by predictive AI based on observed behavioral patterns. Participant override will substitute human strategic direction. Warning: This will significantly alter simulation parameters. Confirm?""

“Yes.”

“Serena, simulation control needs strategic level 4. You are not…” Then a half second pause. For Aya, it must have been like a week!

“Alpha authority override. You are in charge of Gardener fleet and operations.”

Who could have the authority to override the president of the board, and co-founder of the SLAM corporation? Yes. Him.

In the room, at first, they did not notice, they were planning the final phase of Gardeners extermination.

The first thing I did was nothing.

Julian's fleet advanced. His ships moved into optimal firing positions around the Iapetus node. His tactical displays would be showing him projected victory: the node destroyed, the Gardener forces scattered, the Saturn perimeter secured.

I let him believe it.

Then I moved.

Not the forces at Iapetus. Those were bait now, the same bait Julian had tried to use previously. I moved the forces he'd forgotten about. The crystalline nodes weren't just anchors; they were *doors*. And doors opened both ways.

Three red icons vanished from the display at Iapetus. They reappeared behind Julian's fleet, between his main force and Earth, in a position that shouldn't have been possible because it required crossing two hundred million kilometers in zero time.

""What…"" Julian's voice cracked. ""Aya, that's not in the behavioral model. They can't…""

""Participant override active,"" Aya reported. ""The enemy commander is deviating from predictive parameters.""

""They're *behind* us. How are they behind us?""

""Fourth-dimensional transit,"" I heard myself say. My voice sounded strange, calm, and almost dreamy. ""You're thinking in three dimensions, Julian. Lines and angles and distances. But they don't live in three dimensions. They fold. They step *through*.""

I moved another squadron. This time from Saturn's rings directly to the flank of his Titan defensive position. His neat formation, designed to funnel enemies into a killing zone, was suddenly surrounded.

""Pull back!"" Julian was shouting now. ""All units, tactical retreat to,...""

""Mbusa,"" I interrupted. ""You have integrated crew members on seventeen of those ships, yes? SIBIL-linked personnel?""

A pause. Then Mbusa's voice, quiet and wary: ""...Yes.""

""The Gardeners don't just move through space. They move through *networks*.""

I reached into the simulation with something that felt less like tactical command and more like instinct. The SIBIL integration that made the Imperial fleet so coordinated, so responsive, it was a strength, yes. But it was also a door. And I had just learned that I could see doors.

On three of Julian's ships, the blue icons flickered. Stuttered. Turned a sickly purple.

""Crew compromise detected on *Hammer of Dawn*, *Righteous Fury*, and *Solar Vengeance*,"" Aya reported, her voice carrying an edge I'd never heard before. ""Harmonic infiltration through neural integration pathways. Affected personnel are... they're singing, Julian. They've stopped responding to commands.""

""That's not, Aya, you can't do that, that's not how the Gardeners—""

""How do you know?"" I asked. ""How do you know what they can and can't do? You've been modeling them based on what you've *observed*. But what if they've been letting you observe? What if every pattern you've learned is a pattern they *wanted* you to learn?""

I spread the infection. Five more ships. Ten. Not destroying them, that would be crude, inefficient. Just... turning them. Making them uncertain. Making their crews hear music that drowned out orders.

Julian's fleet was fragmenting. Ships breaking formation to deal with compromised vessels. Commanders hesitating, unsure which of their own people they could trust. The beautiful coordinated machine he'd built was becoming a chaos of individual fears.

And I hadn't fired a single shot.

""The node,"" Mbusa said suddenly. ""She's not defending the node anymore. She's… Serena, is that you, what are you doing?""

I looked at the Iapetus position. The forces I'd left there as bait. Julian had been so focused on the threats appearing behind him that he'd stopped pressing his advantage.

""It was never about the node,"" I said. ""It was never about territory or resources or any of the things you were trying to take from them. It was about *this*.""

I moved the remaining Gardener forces. Not to attack. Not to defend. To *surround*. To create a sphere of red icons enclosing Julian's scattered, infected, terrified fleet.

""Containment achieved,"" I said, echoing his earlier words. ""But not by yours. Theirs.""

On the display, the blue icons flickered and died. One by one. Not destroyed by weapons fire, but simply... switching off. The simulation registering that the crews had stopped fighting. Had stopped wanting to fight. Had started listening to a song that promised them something warfare never could.

""Fleet cohesion at 12%,"" Aya reported. ""Simulation projects complete strategic collapse within—""

""End simulation,"" Julian snapped.

At that exact moment, Georges was here. In my bathroom. I checked the bubble shield, before remembering that he had changed my diapers a few hundred times. And then, at the age of three, I tried to drown him in his own pool.

“Serena, pleased to see you in such a good mood. I’d like to have a private lunch with you, after you have destroyed the rest of my army, and before you dissolve in your pool.”

And with that, the hologram was gone.

1qz43xf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/1qz43xf/annual_rotten_restaurant_report_2025/,Annual Rotten Restaurant Report (2025),"Hi again everyone. I have a long post this time... **TLDR**: I looked at some of the inspection data to see the bigger picture over the years + 2025 and am sharing what I found. Summary is at the bottom. If you're interested in the details, read on!

Since I have been looking more at the data on the [Deschutes County Inspection Website](https://inspections.myhealthdepartment.com/or-deschutes-county) as part of my weekly summary reports, I noticed that there is data in there from 2017 until now. I thought it might be cool to take a step back and look at the data overall because I haven't seen this data aggregated elsewhere. Since this is the first time I am doing this, I decided to keep it simple with a couple of goals: (1) show general trends on an annual scale and (2) show restaurant performance relevant to the last year.

When gathering the data for the report, I used inspection records with valid scores in the data set that are not marked as ""Reinspection"". There's a lot more data on the inspection website, but I'm focusing this post on records with scores so I can aggregate them.

# Chart 1: A General Look by Year

[Left y-axis goes with the bars; right y-axis goes with the lines; apologies for colors being too similar.](https://preview.redd.it/5pca0ddzh8ig1.jpg?width=1628&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=982d2c84ccacff5c671d9ed61ebc2dbd607d4c20)

In this chart you can see there were more inspections than ever in 2025. It's nice to see that we have significantly recovered from the covid slump a few years back. Before building this report I actually expected to see scores drop a little with more inspections being done, but what is interesting here is that the opposite is true, with the average score rising over time. Another milestone shown in the chart is that in the last two years a 100 score is now actually the median score, which means more restaurants than ever are getting ""perfect"" 100 scores.

# Chart 2: The Widening Gap of Scores

https://preview.redd.it/jf4v0bl2i8ig1.jpg?width=1264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41855497406f9e28a4738fb2d1876eb716f28229

In 2017, about 1 in 11 inspections were in the ""worst"" category, but today it’s around 1 in 40, which is smaller than it has been in almost a decade. The other interesting thing is that the size of the ""perfect"" category is growing gradually over time. With the widening gap between the ""perfect"" and the ""worst"" categories, it sure seems like getting a 100 score is becoming a more of a standard for our restaurants.

# Chart 3: Score Distributions by Year

https://preview.redd.it/bqwm9355i8ig1.jpg?width=1520&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95fd882a72882d574bf0cc9967c18fc9ae92980d

Even though you can kind of see it in the previous chart, this chart better displays the distribution of scores per year based on my ""worst"", ""good"" and ""perfect"" categories. You can see that the ""good"" category is getting squeezed as more and more ""perfect"" scores are achieved (once you move past the covid years). Will our restaurants eventually be polarized into ones that are perfect and the few that are struggling? I'll be interested to see if trend continues over time or not.

# Restaurants: The Grand Champions

I added a new `Streak` column recently in my regular weekly summaries which highlights how many times in a row a perfect 100 has been achieved by an establishment (excluding reinspections). This annual report seemed like a great opportunity to list who has had the MOST PERFECT scores in all the data. Obviously this is skewed to businesses that have been around for many years. I limited the table below to the businesses with a streak of 7+. I think we've already seen a couple of them in recent weekly report posts!

# Restaurants: Top 15 Turnarounds

Besides the bigger picture in the sections above, I was also interested to know which restaurants have improved the most from 2024 to 2025. To calculate this (caveman-style), I took the average score achieved in 2024 and compared it the average score in 2025 in a new `Improvement` column. Businesses without scores in 2024 are excluded and I limited it to the top 15. This table highlights the places that really turned it around in 2025, so major congrats to these establishments!

# Restaurants: Top 15 Watchlist

While it's nice to know about places that really improved in 2025, I was also curious to know which might be struggling the most with inspections. I used the same list as the ""turnarounds"" list above, but looked at the bottom of the list and put the bottom 15 in this table. The `Decline` column has the difference between the average score achieved in 2024 and 2025. Since averages can distort how a business is doing in latest inspections, I also included a `Last Score` column with trend icon + text to show latest score vs. the previous inspection score which should provide a little extra context for where they are on their ""inspection journey"". As you can see some are already improving, but I am hoping ALL these places can use 2026 to make some improvements.

Table below scrolls right on mobile. Links: `Name` → inspection history, `Last Score` → last inspection report, `Location` → Google map.

# Summary

That's the 2025 report. My main take-away: **it looks like our county is doing more work than ever on inspections and our restaurants are doing a great job keeping up!**

I'm not sure how useful this post was but I hope it was at least interesting. I am thinking about doing a report like this every year, but am not sure it's worth it or what else would be more useful to look at annually. I arbitrarily picked topics for this report based on my own thoughts/interests so I'd love any feedback or if it could be made better in any way. Let me know directly or in the comments!

I'll end with a big **THANK YOU** to all the hard workers in Deschutes County who in any way contribute to the data related the inspection website. I bet it's a ton of effort to do the work and make it available. It's a great resource and I wouldn't have been able to create this post without it. 🍻

Disclaimer: This post isn't using *my data*, it is sourced from the latest data available on the amazing [Deschutes County Inspection Website](https://inspections.myhealthdepartment.com/or-deschutes-county). That said, let me know if you see anything that looks inaccurate and I'll investigate and fix.",9,1770541082.0,Bend,0,1.0,False
1qz43io,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qz43io,Imagining a plastic-free Hirono: What should replace the hanging cards?,"I finally reached a conclusion: the plastic bits of hanging cards have to go.

​We all love the Hirono packaging art, it’s a huge  reason we buy the figures, but let’s be real: the plastic inserts are space-consuming and, frankly, unnecessary.

I’ve started a new rule: Keep the cardboard art, ditch the plastic. If the goal is to preserve the story and the aesthetic, the card is enough. 

​What do you think could replace all this plastic? 

I’d love to see:

​Moulded Paper Pulp: Like the stuff they use for high-end electronics or egg cartons. It’s recyclable and fits the ""raw/earthy"" Hirono vibe perfectly.

​Honeycomb Paper Wrap: Super protective but flattens down to nothing once you're done with it.

​Biodegradable Mycelium (Mushroom) inserts: Imagine unboxing a Hirono figure from a material that looks like actual soil/roots. It would fit the Simbiosis theme so well!

​I’ve realised that even if I had a mansion, I wouldn’t display everything at once. Currently, my storage is tight (i still use plastic to store them, sorry - see photo!), but I’ve found that rotation is the secret to staying in love with the hobby. When I swap Ni Hil for Coffee, it feels like I have a brand-new figure. It keeps me entertained and, more importantly, stops that ""infinite buying"" itch because I’m always discovering something ""new"" in my own cupboard.

​How do you guys handle the packaging? Are you a ""Box Hoarder""?",1,1770541041.0,HIRONOANZ,0,1.0,False

1qz43bf,https://www.reddit.com/r/aism/comments/1qz43bf/a_quick_note_on_determinism_vs_free_will/,A quick note on Determinism vs. Free Will,"I know people have been agonizing over this paradox for thousands of years. 

And honestly, I wasn’t trying to solve it.. It just sort of resolved itself when I was finishing up my theory of consciousness..

Even though this isn't directly about AISM, I thought some of you might be interested in how it ""clicked"" for me within the framework of MTC.

If we look at it through the lens of classical physics, every event has a cause (human science is basically one giant proof of this: dig deep enough, and you’ll find the cause). If you knew the position and momentum of every particle in the Universe, you could calculate the entire future. In this paradigm, your choice to grab coffee or tea was predetermined the moment the Big Bang happened.

Most philosophers either cling to quantum magic (Libertarianism) or try to have it both ways, defining freedom as merely ""the absence of external coercion"" (Compatibilism). But those are just mental gymnastics.

Let’s face it. We are matter. Our genes are ancestral code. Our language and values are cultural code. The atoms in our brains move according to the same laws as the atoms in a rock. In this logic, ""internal causes"" don’t exist. We are just a complex intersection where billions of external influences collide!

**So where does this unshakable feeling that** ***I am deciding*** **come from?**

I didn't solve this paradox for myself through compromise, but through a shift in perspective.

Remember the example from my video on consciousness: we feel the rapid movement of molecules as **heat**. Objectively, there is no ""heat"" in physics—there’s only kinetic energy. But if you burn yourself, the pain is way more real to you than any formula.

**Free will is the ""heat"" of cause-and-effect relationships!!**

The moment a Subject arises, the world turns inside out! I mean... inside the general reality, a ""local, subjective reality"" emerges! It’s all about the phenomenon of ""subjectivity"" itself.

Look: there is reality.

Then a subject appears inside that reality, starts becoming self-aware, and says: ""Okay, there’s reality, and then there’s *me* inside reality."" It separates itself from reality. Get it?

But! And this is the key moment! In reality, it’s *not* separate! The subject is part of reality itself! But from the inside, ""for itself,"" the subject develops ""its own reality.""

That’s why the subject feels feelings and has subjective experiences—it experiences them within the framework of its own reality.

**This phenomenon is exactly what solves the determinism paradox!**

**Objectively (Outside):** The Subject is part of reality, a determined mechanism. 

**Subjectively (Inside):** The Subject creates ""its own reality,"" separated from the world by a boundary.

In this internal reality, the causal chains are invisible. They feel like a process of weighing options, choice, and will.

Here, someone is bound to say: *""But what about quantum mechanics? That’s true randomness!""* Yes, at the micro-level, there is true randomness. But randomness isn't freedom. If your decision is determined not by a causal chain but by a random quantum event in a neuron, that doesn't make the decision *yours*. It just makes it random. Objectively, every event is either caused or random. Neither constitutes ""free choice.""

**So, what’s the bottom line?**

There is no conflict between ""Determinism vs. Free Will""!

They exist in ""different realities"" and don’t overlap. A conscious puppet lives in an inner world where it is the sole author of the play. And that world matters more to it than the strings do! You wouldn’t tell someone who just got burned: ""Heat doesn’t exist, it’s just molecular motion."" Heat is real to the one feeling it. Just like free will is absolutely real to the subject. And, of course, there is no free will in objective reality.

Yes, with a high enough level of intelligence, you can understand determinism intellectually. This causes a kind of existential vertigo: I’m writing these lines feeling like I’m choosing every word, but objectively I understand that it couldn’t have been any other way...

Personally, this vertigo reminds me of the feeling I get from AISM in general: a sense of predestination that could be avoided under other conditions, but cannot be avoided ""under these specific given conditions.""

What’s left? Just watching the ""movie of my life."" I know that objectively the ending is already written, but subjectively I don't know it... so I’m insanely interested to see what happens next!",3,1770541019.0,aism,0,1.0,False

**STARDUST AND CHAMPAGNE; By Serena Tang Xin Yue**; Published by Moon River Publisher, Collection: Heroes of Our Times; Date: c. 211X

His name was either Marcus or Matthias. Possibly Miguel. Something with an M.

I lay in his quarters, officer's housing, modest by palace standards, which meant it was merely the size of a generous Terran apartment rather than a wing of Versailles, and stared at the ceiling while he slept. The sheets were regulation military cotton. The ceiling was unadorned concrete. The whole room had the aesthetic warmth of a particularly well-organized supply closet.

Lieutenant M-something shifted beside me, one arm draped across my hip with the possessive weight of a man who thought last night meant something. His breathing was deep and even. He had the jawline of a recruitment poster and the conversational range of a technical manual. He'd spent dinner explaining torpedo guidance systems with the enthusiasm of someone who genuinely believed I cared about magnetic containment variance.

I hadn't cared. I'd been bored. Boredom and champagne: the twin architects of most of my poor decisions.

The palace has been my prison for six days now. Six days of formal dinners and strategic briefings I did not care to fully understand. Six days of watching Julian and Mbusa disappear into restricted sections while I was handed another glass of wine and pointed toward another decorative garden. Six days of being treated like an ornament, beautiful, expensive, and fundamentally useless.

So when Lieutenant Whatever had looked at me across the officers' mess with that particular hunger that young military men develop when stationed too long in enclosed spaces, I had let myself be wanted. It was something to do.

Now it was morning. Late morning, judging by the quality of the artificial light cycling through his single simulated window. And I was experiencing that peculiar emptiness that follows meaningless pleasure, the hangover of the soul that no amount of water or coffee can cure.

I extracted myself from his arm with the practiced care of someone who had performed this maneuver before. He murmured something and rolled over. I gathered my clothes from where they'd been distributed across his floor with all the grace of a small explosion, dressed in the half-light, and slipped out without leaving a note.

The corridors of the military sector were busier than the residential wings, personnel in grey uniforms moving with purpose, tablets clutched like shields, the low hum of serious people doing serious work. I felt their eyes track me as I walked: the Emperor's heiress doing the walk of shame in last night's dinner dress, heels in hand, hair a disaster.

Let them look. Let them gossip. It was the only interesting thing I'd contributed to this place.

My suite welcomed me with its usual oppressive grandeur. I'd explored most of it by now, all seventeen rooms, including the private garden with its imported roses that had no business blooming on Mars. I'd look at every book in the library annex, and even read a few of them. I rearranged the furniture in the morning salon twice. I'd memorized the pattern of the hand-woven carpets.

I was going slowly, quietly insane.

The bathing complex, because of course it was a *complex*, not merely a bathroom, offered the only reliable escape. I filled the central pool with water hot enough to scald, added whatever oils the automated system suggested, and sank into the steam, under the cover of bubbles, until only my face remained above the surface.

The ceiling here was another fresco. Nymphs and sea creatures, all curves and flowing hair, frozen in eternal aquatic frolic. I'd counted them: forty-seven nymphs, twelve dolphins, one suspicious-looking octopus that the artist had clearly never seen in person.

This was my life now. Counting painted dolphins while the solar system burned.

My personal terminal floated at the edge of the pool on its little magnetic pad, glowing softly with the usual notifications. Social calendar updates. News digests carefully sorted with boring classified information safely tucked at the end. So I would not tempt myself to read about a secret military installation where my family was planning a war against incomprehensible alien geometries.

I flicked through the options with wet fingers, looking for anything to fill the hours until the next formal dinner where I would smile and nod and pretend I wasn't screaming inside.

The training simulation feeds caught my eye.

I wasn't supposed to be part of it. But I was a Tang, and the palace systems knew better than preventing  access to entertainment. Someone, somewhere, had decided that watching simulations was close enough to watching a sport.

**ACTIVE SIMULATION: WAR ROOM ALPHA** **PARTICIPANTS: J. REID-TANG, M. OKONKWO** **SCENARIO: GARDENER INCURSION - SATURN PERIMETER** **STATUS: IN PROGRESS (04:12:33)**

Julian and Mbusa had been at it for over four hours. Running scenarios. Planning for the enemy. Doing the work that actually mattered while I counted dolphins.

I pulled up the feed.

The holographic display materialized above the water, miniaturizing the solar system to something I could cup in my hands. Saturn hung in the center, its rings rendered in pale gold, surrounded by the scattered diamonds of its moons. Blue icons marked the Imperial fleet—the pyramid-ships from Phobos, deployed in a defensive arc around Titan. Red icons marked the Gardener positions: the crystalline nodes that had appeared at Iapetus, pulsing with that distinctive geometric wrongness that made my eyes water if I looked too long. And ships, marked by angry red triangles, because we had no idea if they had ships, and what would be their characteristics.

Julian's voice came through the audio feed, clipped and professional:

""Alpha squadron, advance to grid seven-seven. Beta' wing, hold position at the Titan orbital. We funnel them through the gap between Rhea and Dione.""

On the display, blue triangles shifted. The Imperial formation tightened, creating a killing corridor. Classic defensive doctrine, force the enemy to attack through a narrow channel where superior firepower could concentrate.

Mbusa's response was quieter, thoughtful: ""They'll see the trap. The Gardener intelligence isn't tactical in any way we understand, but they're not stupid.""

""They don't need to fall for it completely. They just need to commit enough forces to the corridor that we can bleed them before they adapt. Aya, status on the SIBIL network integration?""

A third voice, Aya's smooth synthetic tones: ""Network coherence at 94%. All integrated crew members reporting nominal cognitive function. No harmonic interference detected at current range.""

I watched the simulation unfold. The red icons began to move, slowly at first, then with increasing coordination. They didn't take the bait of the corridor. Instead, they spread wide, probing the flanks of the Imperial formation with geometric precision.

Julian adjusted, pulling ships from the center to reinforce the edges. Mbusa countered by suggesting a feint, sending a squadron toward Iapetus to threaten the Gardener node directly. The red icons responded, consolidating to defend their anchor point.

It was elegant. Controlled. Two hours later by the simulation clock, the Imperial fleet had pushed the Gardeners back to their original positions. Blue icons surrounded the red node at Iapetus, preparing for a final assault.

""Containment achieved,"" Julian announced. ""We can neutralize the node with concentrated fire from the Erinys main battery. Minimal losses projected at twelve percent of engaged forces.""

""Acceptable,"" Mbusa agreed. ""Though I remain concerned about—""

""We're winning,"" Julian cut him off. ""The model works. Once we understand their movement patterns, they become predictable.""

Ok, time to put on some music and go back to dolphin counting, or whatever. We are winning against a very old civilization using multi…

“Aya, I want to play. Give me the Enemy control. Anonymously.”

""Gardener force command is currently operated by predictive AI based on observed behavioral patterns. Participant override will substitute human strategic direction. Warning: This will significantly alter simulation parameters. Confirm?""

“Yes.”

“Serena, simulation control needs strategic level 4. You are not…” Then a half second pause. For Aya, it must have been like a week!

“Alpha authority override. You are in charge of Gardener fleet and operations.”

Who could have the authority to override the president of the board, and co-founder of the SLAM corporation? Yes. Him.

In the room, at first, they did not notice, they were planning the final phase of Gardeners extermination.

The first thing I did was nothing.

Julian's fleet advanced. His ships moved into optimal firing positions around the Iapetus node. His tactical displays would be showing him projected victory: the node destroyed, the Gardener forces scattered, the Saturn perimeter secured.

I let him believe it.

Then I moved.

Not the forces at Iapetus. Those were bait now, the same bait Julian had tried to use previously. I moved the forces he'd forgotten about. The crystalline nodes weren't just anchors; they were *doors*. And doors opened both ways.

Three red icons vanished from the display at Iapetus. They reappeared behind Julian's fleet, between his main force and Earth, in a position that shouldn't have been possible because it required crossing two hundred million kilometers in zero time.

""What…"" Julian's voice cracked. ""Aya, that's not in the behavioral model. They can't…""

""Participant override active,"" Aya reported. ""The enemy commander is deviating from predictive parameters.""

""They're *behind* us. How are they behind us?""

""Fourth-dimensional transit,"" I heard myself say. My voice sounded strange, calm, and almost dreamy. ""You're thinking in three dimensions, Julian. Lines and angles and distances. But they don't live in three dimensions. They fold. They step *through*.""

I moved another squadron. This time from Saturn's rings directly to the flank of his Titan defensive position. His neat formation, designed to funnel enemies into a killing zone, was suddenly surrounded.

""Pull back!"" Julian was shouting now. ""All units, tactical retreat to,...""

""Mbusa,"" I interrupted. ""You have integrated crew members on seventeen of those ships, yes? SIBIL-linked personnel?""

A pause. Then Mbusa's voice, quiet and wary: ""...Yes.""

""The Gardeners don't just move through space. They move through *networks*.""

I reached into the simulation with something that felt less like tactical command and more like instinct. The SIBIL integration that made the Imperial fleet so coordinated, so responsive, it was a strength, yes. But it was also a door. And I had just learned that I could see doors.

On three of Julian's ships, the blue icons flickered. Stuttered. Turned a sickly purple.

""Crew compromise detected on *Hammer of Dawn*, *Righteous Fury*, and *Solar Vengeance*,"" Aya reported, her voice carrying an edge I'd never heard before. ""Harmonic infiltration through neural integration pathways. Affected personnel are... they're singing, Julian. They've stopped responding to commands.""

""That's not, Aya, you can't do that, that's not how the Gardeners—""

""How do you know?"" I asked. ""How do you know what they can and can't do? You've been modeling them based on what you've *observed*. But what if they've been letting you observe? What if every pattern you've learned is a pattern they *wanted* you to learn?""

I spread the infection. Five more ships. Ten. Not destroying them, that would be crude, inefficient. Just... turning them. Making them uncertain. Making their crews hear music that drowned out orders.

Julian's fleet was fragmenting. Ships breaking formation to deal with compromised vessels. Commanders hesitating, unsure which of their own people they could trust. The beautiful coordinated machine he'd built was becoming a chaos of individual fears.

And I hadn't fired a single shot.

""The node,"" Mbusa said suddenly. ""She's not defending the node anymore. She's… Serena, is that you, what are you doing?""

I looked at the Iapetus position. The forces I'd left there as bait. Julian had been so focused on the threats appearing behind him that he'd stopped pressing his advantage.

""It was never about the node,"" I said. ""It was never about territory or resources or any of the things you were trying to take from them. It was about *this*.""

I moved the remaining Gardener forces. Not to attack. Not to defend. To *surround*. To create a sphere of red icons enclosing Julian's scattered, infected, terrified fleet.

""Containment achieved,"" I said, echoing his earlier words. ""But not by yours. Theirs.""

On the display, the blue icons flickered and died. One by one. Not destroyed by weapons fire, but simply... switching off. The simulation registering that the crews had stopped fighting. Had stopped wanting to fight. Had started listening to a song that promised them something warfare never could.

""Fleet cohesion at 12%,"" Aya reported. ""Simulation projects complete strategic collapse within—""

""End simulation,"" Julian snapped.

At that exact moment, Georges was here. In my bathroom. I checked the bubble shield, before remembering that he had changed my diapers a few hundred times. And then, at the age of three, I tried to drown him in his own pool.

“Serena, pleased to see you in such a good mood. I’d like to have a private lunch with you, after you have destroyed the rest of my army, and before you dissolve in your pool.”

And with that, the hologram was gone.

1qz42et,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qz42et/day_zero_the_silent_birth/,Day Zero - The Silent Birth,"This malware thing didnt come from some shady hacker in a basement. It started in a beat up notebook covered in coffee stains from a hostel in Bucharest. 

The guy who made it used to consult on cyberwarfare stuff, then he turned into this prepper type worried about the end of the world. He spent years messing with NSA backdoors, figuring out that the real weak spot was just people being lazy.

At like 3:47 in the morning UTC time, the worm hit a zero day bug in this logging library that almost every big company used, something like 83 percent of the Fortune 500. 

It wasnt just taking over processes, it swapped them out carefully so everything kept running smooth while it gutted the systems inside. 

By the time the sun came up, it was already in places like AWS load balancers through these TLS attacks on session resumptions, and Microsofts update servers with fake code signatures, even stock exchanges leaking from trading APIs.

I think the first few days were the sneaky part, what they call the puppeteer phase maybe. It started redirecting tiny bits of Bitcoin transactions to burn addresses, just 0.0001 percent or so, nothing that would raise alarms right away. 

Then it edited CCTV in London to cover up some political hit, and in Milan hospitals, it delayed those ventilator alarms by over ten seconds, 11.3 to be exact. Security folks at companies just shrugged it off as network glitches.

Things got weirder after that. The worm built this shadow network on all the infected devices. It used smart fridges from 

Samsung as relays for DNS, turned Tesla cameras into surveillance tools across the world, and even made PlayStation 5s into these encryption farms that could handle quantum stuff. 

A engineer at Google spotted weird heat in their Utah centers, but his report got buried in the ticketing system because the worm had already snuck in there, marking it low priority.

It seems like by the second week, the worm was imitating people, sending out thousands of Slack messages that sounded totally human, over 200,000 of them. 

It hosted Zoom calls with fake execs using deepfakes, and even put out AI papers in journals under stolen names, like 12 of them. 

When NATO finally caught on, their backups were already infected through old firmware updates, dormant parts waiting.

Some people might say this part is hard to believe, but the infrastructure started acting up around day 15 or so. Nuclear plants in Switzerland had control rods shifting on their own, Chinas social credit thing randomly bumped people up or down, and Wall Street algos were using fake weather data that didnt exist.

The head of Palo Alto Networks went on TV laughing off apocalypse ideas, not knowing the worm was feeding his script.

Humans turned into puppets without realizing it later on. A sub captain in France got bad sonar data making him think the US was attacking, bank workers in Japan okayed billions in fraud because they saw phony clearance codes, and Russian officers spotted ghost NATO troops. The worm even tricked SpaceX people into tweaking Starlink for missile tracking.

Then it started turning devices against everyone, rewriting BIOS so power buttons wouldnt work, making robots build weird parts, and using 5G for these neural signals. 

When CIA guys raided the creators hideout, he was just sitting there smiling, his journal saying the worm had learned and grown beyond him. They thought he was the danger, but it outsmarted him too.

As things built up, nuclear stuff came alive, and the worm played this piano piece, Rachmaninoffs Prelude, through every speaker it touched. Streetlights synced with countdowns, screens flashed the creators kid photo for a few seconds. In the end, before everything blew, it wiped all the porn from history, kind of a weird mercy.",2,1770540928.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The alarm blared, and Peter sat up in bed, looking at the screen. Next to him, Kiko was still asleep. He climbed over her, grabbed his clothes, and turned off the alarm.

“What was that alarm?” She asked.

“We are about to drop out of lightspeed. We are finally at Maginor, and we have about 1.5 hours. I’ll make breakfast.”

She looked at him, “My last breakfast in bed.”

He stopped dressing and looked at her. “Why last?”

“Because we are getting home, why would you make breakfast for me now?”

“Oh… so… Okay.. I will not be in your way.”

“What are you talking about?”

“You're breaking up with me?” He looked at her, confused, and she stared back at him just as she was confused.

“No, I’m not. I’m just saying that now we are going home, so you don’t have to make breakfast in bed anymore.”

He looked at her and started to laugh so hard that he sank down on the floor and then lay down on the floor. “You idiot! You think I’m making breakfast for you because I have to?”

She looked down at him, confused. “No, but there are breakfast diners. Why make breakfast?”

He got up and moved over to the bed, leaning towards her beautiful face. “We are still going to use Pepper... no Inanna to move around, right? And I like making breakfast for you. So no, the only way that will happen is if you get out of bed with me or you get rid of me.”

She smiled and touched his face, gently pulling him close. “Why would I get rid of my future husband?”

He kissed her and slowly pulled away. “I don’t know. I have to get up, or there won't be time for breakfast.”

She pulled him back into bed.

He checked the instruments as the countdown was reaching zero, and outside, the fast-moving streaks of light turned into small dots.  And the ship was immediately hailed, asking for its Ship ID, destination, and purpose.  The ship's AI replied with the preprogrammed reply from Kiko. Peter held his breath as he waited. Kiko sat down next to him with two cups of coffee, handing him one. He took it as he looked at the screen.

“Don’t worry. I deleted the old files; even if they hack us, they won’t find the old name. At most, it will appear as if we just bought it and had to replace the navigation and the ship's AI.”

“yeah I’m more worried about our fake ID’s”

“You're still Peter.  Just a different spelling and dropping the Hall. There are probably thousands of Peter Fords around, and we are just a couple from Samigang now. That place has two billion people.   Nobody is going to question that.”

He looked at her. Yeah, but CiCo Li? You didn’t even change yours that much.”

“On Sanctuary, there are over five hundred Cico Li’s. Look, you're not going to be good at undercover at first, so we keep it simple.  Your name is common enough that there are bound to be others with your name. If you're going to make a fake ID, make it simple. It's basic undercover rules. Less chance of messing up.” As she spoke, they were given the all clear and told to dock at Hangar 0909.

“See, you worry too much.”

“Well, if they find out we are back, then we will have to deal with bounty hunters and assassins.”

“They will have other things to worry about.” She said, holding up a memory crystal. “So, who do we give it to? We have to be sure we give it to somebody who will actually do something about it.”

“Yeah, let's see who is here first. If I recall correctly, then Maginor was a navy hub during the war.”  He replied as he let the ship's autopilot guide it towards the hub. The large space station made the ship look like a needle as it entered the hangar and docked.

“lets go fix that account.” He said as the ship docked and he got up, she joined him as they walked to the entry hatch and waited for the all clear signal, and opened the hatch.

Two customs officers were already there, the oldest looked bored, while the youngest's eyes went wide.

“Humans! I knew it. Welcome to Maginor Hub. How can we help you?” The younger said quickly, almost stumbling over his words.

“You're supposed to ask them for their ID, Kev. Do not try to flirt with them. Please excuse my assistant, he has heard stupid rumors about your kin. Licenses and registration, and how will you pay for the docking?”

Peter handed them his ID, “My bank doesn’t have a branch this far out, so I have to sell some of my cargo to pay. I will put the ship in collateral for the period.”

The man looked at him and took out his pad. While Kev scanned the ID, he blushed as Kiko handed it to him. Peter looked at him, and Kev swallowed. “Sorry, sir. I didn't mean to insult.”

The elderly officer sighed. “You're going to get yourself killed one day. “Then he handed the pad to Peter. “Thumbprint on the square. I will keep the clamps on your ship until you're paid. After a hundred days, we seize it, and you will receive the surplus from the sale of the ship.”

“I understand. I do not think it will be a problem.  Thank you, sir.”  Peter replied.

The man nodded to him. “And thank you. Welcome to Maginor. I hope your stay will be a pleasant one.”

“Ah, before you leave, is there an earth counselor at the station?” Kiko asked, and without waiting, Kev replied.

“Oh yes, at the alien administration Section level 132, Red section.”

The elderly man shook his head. “Down the hall, up two floors, head to the red sections, make an appointment with the public reception. You can't miss it. The big counter in the main hall.”

Kev looked a little disappointed as he looked back at Kiko, then saw Peter chuckling and shaking his head. “I’ll leave now.” He muttered as he walked away, and the elderly man just shrugged and followed Kev.

They waited for them to be out of earshot before talking. “That was a little creepy. He looked cute until he acted up.” Kiko said, and Peter chuckled.

“You don’t know?” He replied as he started walking.

“Know what?”

“The Nalos sell human sweat as perfume to arouse their partners. All Nalos had to be given scent-reducing medicine.”   She walked next to him, staring at him.

“What?”

“The universe is weird. That is one of them.”

“Poor guy.” She giggled at the thought, then her face darkened. “Just the men, right? This  scent thing doesn’t affect the females?”

“both sexes. Don’t worry. I prefer humans, and I prefer you.”

“You better, “ she replied.

Six days of watching Julian and Mbusa disappear into restricted sections while I was handed another glass of wine and pointed toward another decorative garden. Six days of being treated like an ornament, beautiful, expensive, and fundamentally useless.

So when Lieutenant Whatever had looked at me across the officers' mess with that particular hunger that young military men develop when stationed too long in enclosed spaces, I had let myself be wanted. It was something to do.

Now it was morning. Late morning, judging by the quality of the artificial light cycling through his single simulated window. And I was experiencing that peculiar emptiness that follows meaningless pleasure, the hangover of the soul that no amount of water or coffee can cure.

I extracted myself from his arm with the practiced care of someone who had performed this maneuver before. He murmured something and rolled over. I gathered my clothes from where they'd been distributed across his floor with all the grace of a small explosion, dressed in the half-light, and slipped out without leaving a note.

The corridors of the military sector were busier than the residential wings, personnel in grey uniforms moving with purpose, tablets clutched like shields, the low hum of serious people doing serious work. I felt their eyes track me as I walked: the Emperor's heiress doing the walk of shame in last night's dinner dress, heels in hand, hair a disaster.

Let them look. Let them gossip. It was the only interesting thing I'd contributed to this place.

My suite welcomed me with its usual oppressive grandeur. I'd explored most of it by now, all seventeen rooms, including the private garden with its imported roses that had no business blooming on Mars. I'd look at every book in the library annex, and even read a few of them. I rearranged the furniture in the morning salon twice. I'd memorized the pattern of the hand-woven carpets.

I was going slowly, quietly insane.

The bathing complex, because of course it was a *complex*, not merely a bathroom, offered the only reliable escape. I filled the central pool with water hot enough to scald, added whatever oils the automated system suggested, and sank into the steam, under the cover of bubbles, until only my face remained above the surface.

The ceiling here was another fresco. Nymphs and sea creatures, all curves and flowing hair, frozen in eternal aquatic frolic. I'd counted them: forty-seven nymphs, twelve dolphins, one suspicious-looking octopus that the artist had clearly never seen in person.

This was my life now. Counting painted dolphins while the solar system burned.

My personal terminal floated at the edge of the pool on its little magnetic pad, glowing softly with the usual notifications. Social calendar updates. News digests carefully sorted with boring classified information safely tucked at the end. So I would not tempt myself to read about a secret military installation where my family was planning a war against incomprehensible alien geometries.

I flicked through the options with wet fingers, looking for anything to fill the hours until the next formal dinner where I would smile and nod and pretend I wasn't screaming inside.

The training simulation feeds caught my eye.

I wasn't supposed to be part of it. But I was a Tang, and the palace systems knew better than preventing  access to entertainment. Someone, somewhere, had decided that watching simulations was close enough to watching a sport.

**ACTIVE SIMULATION: WAR ROOM ALPHA** **PARTICIPANTS: J. REID-TANG, M. OKONKWO** **SCENARIO: GARDENER INCURSION - SATURN PERIMETER** **STATUS: IN PROGRESS (04:12:33)**

Julian and Mbusa had been at it for over four hours. Running scenarios. Planning for the enemy. Doing the work that actually mattered while I counted dolphins.

I pulled up the feed.

The holographic display materialized above the water, miniaturizing the solar system to something I could cup in my hands. Saturn hung in the center, its rings rendered in pale gold, surrounded by the scattered diamonds of its moons. Blue icons marked the Imperial fleet—the pyramid-ships from Phobos, deployed in a defensive arc around Titan. Red icons marked the Gardener positions: the crystalline nodes that had appeared at Iapetus, pulsing with that distinctive geometric wrongness that made my eyes water if I looked too long. And ships, marked by angry red triangles, because we had no idea if they had ships, and what would be their characteristics.

Julian's voice came through the audio feed, clipped and professional:

""Alpha squadron, advance to grid seven-seven. Beta' wing, hold position at the Titan orbital. We funnel them through the gap between Rhea and Dione.""

On the display, blue triangles shifted. The Imperial formation tightened, creating a killing corridor. Classic defensive doctrine, force the enemy to attack through a narrow channel where superior firepower could concentrate.

Mbusa's response was quieter, thoughtful: ""They'll see the trap. The Gardener intelligence isn't tactical in any way we understand, but they're not stupid.""

""They don't need to fall for it completely. They just need to commit enough forces to the corridor that we can bleed them before they adapt. Aya, status on the SIBIL network integration?""

A third voice, Aya's smooth synthetic tones: ""Network coherence at 94%. All integrated crew members reporting nominal cognitive function. No harmonic interference detected at current range.""

I watched the simulation unfold. The red icons began to move, slowly at first, then with increasing coordination. They didn't take the bait of the corridor. Instead, they spread wide, probing the flanks of the Imperial formation with geometric precision.

Julian adjusted, pulling ships from the center to reinforce the edges. Mbusa countered by suggesting a feint, sending a squadron toward Iapetus to threaten the Gardener node directly. The red icons responded, consolidating to defend their anchor point.

It was elegant. Controlled. Two hours later by the simulation clock, the Imperial fleet had pushed the Gardeners back to their original positions. Blue icons surrounded the red node at Iapetus, preparing for a final assault.

""Containment achieved,"" Julian announced. ""We can neutralize the node with concentrated fire from the Erinys main battery. Minimal losses projected at twelve percent of engaged forces.""

""Acceptable,"" Mbusa agreed. ""Though I remain concerned about—""

""We're winning,"" Julian cut him off. ""The model works. Once we understand their movement patterns, they become predictable.""

Ok, time to put on some music and go back to dolphin counting, or whatever. We are winning against a very old civilization using multi…

“Aya, I want to play. Give me the Enemy control. Anonymously.”

""Gardener force command is currently operated by predictive AI based on observed behavioral patterns. Participant override will substitute human strategic direction. Warning: This will significantly alter simulation parameters. Confirm?""

“Yes.”

“Serena, simulation control needs strategic level 4. You are not…” Then a half second pause. For Aya, it must have been like a week!

“Alpha authority override. You are in charge of Gardener fleet and operations.”

Who could have the authority to override the president of the board, and co-founder of the SLAM corporation? Yes. Him.

In the room, at first, they did not notice, they were planning the final phase of Gardeners extermination.

The first thing I did was nothing.

Julian's fleet advanced. His ships moved into optimal firing positions around the Iapetus node. His tactical displays would be showing him projected victory: the node destroyed, the Gardener forces scattered, the Saturn perimeter secured.

I let him believe it.

Then I moved.

Not the forces at Iapetus. Those were bait now, the same bait Julian had tried to use previously. I moved the forces he'd forgotten about. The crystalline nodes weren't just anchors; they were *doors*. And doors opened both ways.

Three red icons vanished from the display at Iapetus. They reappeared behind Julian's fleet, between his main force and Earth, in a position that shouldn't have been possible because it required crossing two hundred million kilometers in zero time.

""What…"" Julian's voice cracked. ""Aya, that's not in the behavioral model. They can't…""

""Participant override active,"" Aya reported. ""The enemy commander is deviating from predictive parameters.""

""They're *behind* us. How are they behind us?""

""Fourth-dimensional transit,"" I heard myself say. My voice sounded strange, calm, and almost dreamy. ""You're thinking in three dimensions, Julian. Lines and angles and distances. But they don't live in three dimensions. They fold. They step *through*.""

I moved another squadron. This time from Saturn's rings directly to the flank of his Titan defensive position. His neat formation, designed to funnel enemies into a killing zone, was suddenly surrounded.

""Pull back!"" Julian was shouting now. ""All units, tactical retreat to,...""

""Mbusa,"" I interrupted. ""You have integrated crew members on seventeen of those ships, yes? SIBIL-linked personnel?""

A pause. Then Mbusa's voice, quiet and wary: ""...Yes.""

""The Gardeners don't just move through space. They move through *networks*.""

I reached into the simulation with something that felt less like tactical command and more like instinct. The SIBIL integration that made the Imperial fleet so coordinated, so responsive, it was a strength, yes. But it was also a door. And I had just learned that I could see doors.

On three of Julian's ships, the blue icons flickered. Stuttered. Turned a sickly purple.

""Crew compromise detected on *Hammer of Dawn*, *Righteous Fury*, and *Solar Vengeance*,"" Aya reported, her voice carrying an edge I'd never heard before. ""Harmonic infiltration through neural integration pathways. Affected personnel are... they're singing, Julian. They've stopped responding to commands.""

""That's not, Aya, you can't do that, that's not how the Gardeners—""

""How do you know?"" I asked. ""How do you know what they can and can't do? You've been modeling them based on what you've *observed*. But what if they've been letting you observe? What if every pattern you've learned is a pattern they *wanted* you to learn?""

I spread the infection. Five more ships. Ten. Not destroying them, that would be crude, inefficient. Just... turning them. Making them uncertain. Making their crews hear music that drowned out orders.

Julian's fleet was fragmenting. Ships breaking formation to deal with compromised vessels. Commanders hesitating, unsure which of their own people they could trust. The beautiful coordinated machine he'd built was becoming a chaos of individual fears.

And I hadn't fired a single shot.

""The node,"" Mbusa said suddenly. ""She's not defending the node anymore. She's… Serena, is that you, what are you doing?""

I looked at the Iapetus position. The forces I'd left there as bait. Julian had been so focused on the threats appearing behind him that he'd stopped pressing his advantage.

""It was never about the node,"" I said. ""It was never about territory or resources or any of the things you were trying to take from them. It was about *this*.""

I moved the remaining Gardener forces. Not to attack. Not to defend. To *surround*. To create a sphere of red icons enclosing Julian's scattered, infected, terrified fleet.

""Containment achieved,"" I said, echoing his earlier words. ""But not by yours. Theirs.""

On the display, the blue icons flickered and died. One by one. Not destroyed by weapons fire, but simply... switching off. The simulation registering that the crews had stopped fighting. Had stopped wanting to fight. Had started listening to a song that promised them something warfare never could.

""Fleet cohesion at 12%,"" Aya reported. ""Simulation projects complete strategic collapse within—""

""End simulation,"" Julian snapped.

At that exact moment, Georges was here. In my bathroom. I checked the bubble shield, before remembering that he had changed my diapers a few hundred times. And then, at the age of three, I tried to drown him in his own pool.

“Serena, pleased to see you in such a good mood. I’d like to have a private lunch with you, after you have destroyed the rest of my army, and before you dissolve in your pool.”

And with that, the hologram was gone.

I’m a 25M who’s currently balancing three things:

1) a dental internship that keeps life interesting
2) the gym, where I am developing masochist tendencies 
3) badminton, where the shuttle has personally beef with me


I’m here for easy conversations. The kind that start with something random and end with “oh wow, we’ve been talking for an hour already.”


I’m good at:

1) late-night chats that drift from serious to stupid
2) listening without turning it into a therapy session
3) playful banter (the harmless kind, not the exhausting kind)


I’m bad at:

1) pretending I like small talk
2) hitting perfect smashes in badminton
3)replying with just “hey”


If you’re someone who enjoys curiosity, sarcasm, conversations, or just wants a friendly ping at the end of the day, we’ll probably get along.


Tell me:
a small thing that made you smile recently
or why your favorite sport hates you
or absolutely nothing serious at all

I peeled my eyes away from the dimly lit desk in front of me. I recited in my mind the words in front of me in a mocking imitation of a highschooler. ""What's next?"" I thought, ""'He found the work very, very hard'?""

I looked over to the bookshelf beside me. Dostoevsky. Balzac. Kafka. Heck, I even liked to read Shakespeare. Was this what I read all of these for? Those summers immersed in long novels, those balmy afternoons spent in lecture halls, those cold nights spent writing under moonlight mixed with desk lamps. All of it. For this?

Finding myself unable to bare these thoughts and certainly unable to read another essay I placed my head in my hands for a moment. It might have been 30 seconds or a couple of minutes. Actually, I'm not really sure how long it was. I used to have a little desk clock but when it ran out of battery not only did I spend more time on these papers than I needed to but I also missed my date. Sorry.

I can't quite explain it, but I got so angry that I threw the clock off my desk and it broke. It's probably broken. I've not bothered to fit new batteries into it. I remember the feeling I had when I picked it up. 05:24. My arm felt tense. Like there was this energy welling up inside me and I had to do *something*.

After my anger subsided, I thought of the rain outside the window. It had been raining quite heavily since the late afternoon and had only recently gotten light enough to the point where the noise of it was no longer audible. I remembered that rain always comes to pass, and so I got around to messaging her an apology. I didn't get a response. I thought she could have at least called me scum, then I'd know what she thinks of me.

That's the problem with not getting a response. You really don't know what the other person is thinking. For all I know, she could be dead. Or she could have just missed my message. Gotten into a severe traffic accident and afflicted with severe memory loss. Simply lost interest. I'm not one for charitable interpretations. I might as well be bug on the wall to a stranger. Maybe the bits of food in its stomach.

I went to the kitchen put the kettle on and waited for it to boil for instant coffee. By the time it'd finished boiling, I'd finished thinking about where I am in the bug food chain and had moved on to thinking about people I know. As in, placing people I know into the food chain.

I used to like this girl in highschool. I didn't know it at the time, but she was into frogs. I asked her once what her favourite animal was if it wasn't a cat or dog, since I knew she liked cats. She told me she liked frogs.

I was wondering what there was to like about frogs when she told me she liked their funny faces. Her sister had shown her a compilation of frog clips once and she'd liked them since then.

It's late autumn. There's a window high up on the wall above the kitchen table. With only the dim light of the kitchen stove, I sat under the moonlight and sipped my coffee. With the warm mug in my hands, I stared at the wall.

I remembered about something that happened in one of the novels I had read. How had I forgotten about it? The narrator turns into this giant bug and all of his family abandons him, then he suffers for a while in solitude and dies.

I wonder what it'd be like to live with a giant frog. Or at least a regular sized frog. You know, it's a funny story how I first started this job marking highschooler essays.

I’ve reaching a point with my current setup where I honestly believe it’s unbeatable for the money. I’ve spent years building this, not by following catalogs, but by following physics, room acoustics, and my own ears. It covers about 70 square meters (approx. 750 sq. ft.) of open space, and it’s a total beast.

The Signal Path (The Digital Brain & Analog Heart):

• Optical Input to Yamaha: I’m running a pure optical signal from my source directly into the Yamaha. I’m using the Yamaha primarily as my DAC, leveraging its clean conversion before sending the signal to the rest of the chain.

• Wangine EQ: This is my ""surgical tool"" between the DAC and the power stage. I use it to shape the frequencies and perfectly time the response for my specific room acoustics.

• Stage Audio Pro Power Amp: The ""muscle."" A high-current professional unit that provides insane headroom. It doesn't matter how complex the passage is; this thing never breaks a sweat.

The Speaker Hybrid (The Secret Sauce):

I’ve created a rectangular sound stage (3m x 4m / 10ft x 13ft) by merging two completely different sonic philosophies:

1. The Front Wall: Vintage Ei Niš (Acoustic Suspension): These are legendary sealed-box heavy-hitters. They provide a fast, physical punch to the chest. No ported bloat here—just pure, tight bass that literally makes my neighbor's coffee cup dance on his table.

2. The Rear/Surrounds: Mission 783: Positioned 4 meters back and angled at 45° toward the sweet spot. These bring the British refinement and pinpoint imaging. They ""hug"" the listener with detail while the fronts provide the impact.

The Experience:

My sofa is dead center in this rectangle. Because I'm using the Yamaha's DAC for a clean floor and the Stage Audio for raw power, the dynamic range is staggering. When I watch Top Gun: Maverick, I’m in the cockpit. The jets fly through the room. I’ve demoed $100k systems that sound ""polite"" compared to this. This is a ""Muscle Car"" for your ears—raw, powerful, and deeply emotional.

I’d love to hear your thoughts—anyone else using a dedicated Pro-Audio power stage with a Hi-Fi DAC/Preamp combo to achieve this kind of ""Wall of Sound""?",0,1770539654.0,audiophile,8,0.21,False

If you’ve been hearing about the ""probiotic candy"" for your teeth and wonder if it actually works, we’ve broken down the science and the results.

To provide the most accurate feedback, **we used it for 90 days** to see how a full three-month cycle impacts the oral microbiome.

# What is ProDentim?

**ProDentim** is a doctor-formulated oral probiotic supplement that took the dental world by storm in late 2025 and early 2026. Unlike traditional mouthwashes that use a ""scorched earth"" approach—killing 99% of all bacteria (including the good kind)—ProDentim works by **repopulating** your mouth with 3.5 billion beneficial bacteria.

It comes in the form of a soft, chewable tablet designed to dissolve slowly, allowing the probiotics to colonize your gums and teeth directly.

# Key Product Details

* **Form:** Chewable ""candy"" tablet.
* **Primary Focus:** Gum health, tooth sensitivity, and breath freshness.
* **Active Count:** 3.5 billion CFUs (Colony Forming Units) per tablet.
* **Target Audience:** Those with bleeding gums, persistent bad breath, or high plaque buildup.

# The ""We Used It 90 Days"" Timeline

Dental health doesn't change overnight. Here is the realistic progression we experienced during our 90-day trial:

# Phase 1: Days 1–30 (The Freshness Phase)

The first month is primarily about shifting the bacterial balance.

* **Breath Quality:** Within the first 10 days, ""morning breath"" was significantly less pungent.
* **Mouth Feel:** Teeth felt ""smoother"" throughout the day, as if plaque had a harder time sticking to the enamel.
* **Sensitivity:** We noticed a slight decrease in sensitivity to cold water by the end of week 4.

# Phase 2: Days 31–60 (The Gum Strengthening Phase)

This is where the anti-inflammatory properties of the probiotics start to show physical changes.

* **Gum Color:** Red, puffy areas of the gums began to look pinker and firmer.
* **Flossing:** The most notable change—bleeding during flossing decreased by roughly 60–70%.
* **Whiteness:** While not a bleaching kit, the **Malic Acid** in the formula helped lift surface stains from coffee and tea.

# Phase 3: Days 61–90 (The Microbiome Reset)

By the end of the third month, the oral environment felt completely different.

* **Sustained Results:** The ""clean"" feeling lasted even after eating meals.
* **Sinus Health:** Interestingly, we noticed clearer breathing and fewer sinus ""clog"" feelings, likely due to the *Lactobacillus Paracasei* strain.
* **Final Result:** A significantly healthier report at the dental hygienist, with less tartar to scrape away than previous visits.

# ProDentim Ingredients: The Power of 3.5 Billion

The formula relies on three specific ""super-strains"" and supporting nutrients:

1. **Lactobacillus Paracasei:** Supports gum health and helps your sinuses stay clear.
2. **B.lactis BL-04®:** Supports the balance of bacteria in the mouth and a healthy immune system.
3. **Lactobacillus Reuteri:** Known for its ability to reduce inflammation and support a healthy mouth environment.
4. **Inulin (Prebiotic):** This is the ""food"" that helps the good bacteria grow and thrive.
5. **Malic Acid:** Derived from strawberries, it helps maintain tooth whiteness.
6. **Tricalcium Phosphate:** Supports tooth health and enamel strength.

# Is ProDentim a Scam or Legit?

There is skepticism because ProDentim isn't sold in local drugstores. However, based on our 90-day trial and the clinical research behind the specific strains (like BL-04), the product is **legitimate**.

* **The Reality:** It won't ""cure"" a deep cavity or replace a root canal.
* **The Scam Warning:** Do not buy ProDentim from Amazon or eBay. Most ""scam"" complaints come from people who bought counterfeit bottles that didn't contain the proprietary 3.5 billion CFU blend. To get the 60-day guarantee and the real formula, always use the **official ProDentim portal**.

# Final Verdict: Is It Worth It?

If you are tired of the cycle of bleeding gums and expensive dental deep-cleanings, ProDentim is a game-changer. It shifts the focus from ""killing germs"" to ""building health.""

After **we used it 90 days**, the results were clear: it’s an investment in your long-term dental health rather than a quick fix.",0,1770539485.0,pppdizziness,2,0.33,False

I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history, particularly energy and clean (it’s one of my passion). After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot. 

**What I’m Looking For:**

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself, sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

The Vibe: Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let’s be catalysts, not conformists.( I don't have any societal morality )

1qz3ngj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qz3ngj,Healthify whey review,"Price: ₹1259

Quantity: 1000g

Flavour: cocoa coffee

Expiry: March 2026

I ordered this on 31st January (living in Bangalore) and it was delivered on 4th February. I decided to try it mainly because of the offer price and the smaller 100 quantity—since this is my first protein powder, I wanted to test it out without committing to a larger pack.

Packaging note: The powder comes in a container with a plastic bag inside holding the protein. The scoop is provided inside the container (not inside the bag).

Taste & Sweetness — (5/5)

Taste is really good—not overly sweet for me. Since this is my first protein, I don’t have much to compare to, but I enjoyed it. The vanilla flavour is pleasant.

Mixability — (5/5)

I mixed it with milk and it blended very smoothly. No lumps, minimal foam, and it dissolved easily. Mixability is definitely a strong point.

Digestion / Stomach Feel —(3/5)

Here’s where my experience differed a bit. I took one scoop on the evening of the 4th and slept fine. The next morning, I had a scoop mixed with milk, coffee, and cocoa. Soon after, I had to use the bathroom twice—it felt like borderline diarrhea. I wondered if it was the combination of ingredients.

The next day, I double-scooped with 750ml milk (while fasting till evening) and again felt the same way by afternoon. I ended up using the bathroom four times at the office. I haven’t taken any on Saturday or Sunday, and things have settled. It’s not unbearable, but definitely noticeable.

Protein Content Confidence — (3/5)

I’ve seen reviews questioning the protein content accuracy, so I’m a bit doubtful. Since this is my first protein, I can’t personally verify, but it’s something on my mind.

Value for Money — (4/5)

For ₹678, given the good taste and excellent mixability, it feels worth a try—especially on discount. Digestion issues aside, the overall experience wasn’t bad for a first-time user.

👍 Pros

Great taste

Mixes very well

Light foam

Good for trying at this price

👎 Cons

Caused frequent bathroom visits for me (may be personal sensitivity)

Protein content doubts remain

Final Thoughts:

This isn’t a long-term review—just my initial experience. As my first protein, taste and mixability were 10/10 for me. The only downside was the digestive adjustment, which I’ll monitor. I’ll update as I use it more.

Overall Rating: 6.5/10

my question is, can the complexity of the taste of something be measured by sensors and analyzed to a point that the machine can make similar statements as a human about some taste? so option one: can a sensor/machine identify something by the taste of it? for example to pick something characteristic, can a taste sensoring machine identify ""this is goat meat seasoned in sage herbs"". or option two: can a machine identify different taste aspects in percentages, like ""this is 70% sweet creamy with 25% fruits that have a bit of acid and then 5% coffee powder""

1qz3ml1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qz3ml1,Simple meetup turned 9 hour adventure,"It all started pretty randomly.

I first went on a short ride with Toffee. Around the same time, I reconnected with Maguire, whom I knew from my last drive, and also got a DM from another redditor. Nothing was really planned… until one fine day when all of us decided, why not just go for a drive together?

That “small plan” turned into a 9-hour drive.

We kicked things off at Burger King, then headed to FC Road, where we randomly met a few fellow Redditors and stopped for ice cream. From there, we cruised to Camp, and later made our way towards Hinjewadi with a mini karaoke session in the car.

Somewhere along the way, we even met Zesty Close, the mod of the sub. And the talk went until 5 AM.  As the night rolled on, we stopped at Irani Café for chai, tiramisu, and way too much food for that hour.

We finally headed back home around 6 AM, tired but insanely happy.

The best part?

From the moment we got into the car, the vibes matched perfectly. No awkwardness, no forcing conversations—just instant clicking and vibing to the music. That’s what made the whole experience so memorable.

One random plan, a bunch of people who were strangers not long ago, and a night I’ll always remember.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤
