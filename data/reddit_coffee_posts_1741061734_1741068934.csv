Would be cool to kill some time and run couple of GMs, because I did not run GMs at all this week? So, I grabbed some coffee and birthday cake and went for it.

My desired roll for Palindrome was:

Hammer Forged Rifling
Accurized rounds
Outlaw
Magnificent Howl
Range MW

And with a huge grain of luck I wanted Elemental capacitor as alternative perk instead of Outlaw.

May not be perfect, but it was my wish.

Imagine the volume of my scream when I got the EXACT 6/6 DESIRED ROLL from the first and only GM run this week. 

Damn, I can't even remember when I got this lucky with a roll. Last time I remember is getting 5/5 (6/6 with desired kill clip) Immortal Adept on the first Lightfall trials with the 3rd roll. 

Well, at least I can go to work now with a huge morale boost",1,1741068832.0,DestinyTheGame,0,1.0,False
1j34e3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1j34e3s/vaginal_bleeding_after_almost_3_years_post/,Vaginal bleeding after almost 3 years post menopausal,"Hi,

I just turned 46 in February and my last period was 2 years and 10 months ago.  I have not even had a spot, drop of blood, discharge, anything since my last period, it just never came back.  I will try to keep background info basic in order to focus on what‚Äôs going on right now.  I have not seen a GYN since 2017, I have mentioned to my GP several times that I should probably be referred to one (this was before my bleeding) since I haven‚Äôt been since 2017, but I acquired a neurological disorder right before I turned 40 due to complications from a gallbladder removal, so by the end of my regular appointments, the GYN never gets addressed because she‚Äôs focused on the treatment for my neuro disorder (functional neurological disorder is what it is).  So as I said before, since May 2024 I have had no spotting, indication of a period or anything whatsoever.  Today I started having a really bad headache and my stomach cramping and almost felt like it was burning on the inside.  I went to the bathroom and when I wiped I noticed a small tinge of brown discharge which reminded me of what wouId happen at the end of a period.  At first I was taken aback because I‚Äôve always been told you should never have vaginal bleeding after you‚Äôre through menopause, but it was such a small amount I kind of shrugged it off.  As the day progressed though, I started having diarrhea as well, with painful cramps and this time there was actual dark red blood about the size of my pinky finger on my underwear and each time I have went to the bathroom a little more has come out onto my underwear (pad now), not like a real period but the amount in my underwear was enough to bother me because before it was only when I wiped earlier in the day, and this means it‚Äôs actually coming out now on its own.  So now its late and I feel exhausted, like weak, my stomach hurts really bad and my lower abdomen both feel like they‚Äôre burning inside is the only way I can explain it, my right lower back is aching, getting another headache, and there‚Äôs still blood when I wipe but to top it off the last time I went to the bathroom when I went to flush, it looked there were coffee grounds floating around in my toilet.  I‚Äôve never seen that before.  All this combined makes me feel like something isn‚Äôt right and my mom passed a couple years ago so I can‚Äôt talk to her about it.  I called my GP earlier in the day before she closed and they made me an appointment for Thursday because she wants to see me before referring me to a gynecologist and didn‚Äôt really seem concerned, but with my stomach hurting this much and still having the blood, is It reasonable to wait? I mean even if it is something bad going to the ER isn‚Äôt going to fix it any sooner I wouldn‚Äôt think, but this all happened so abruptly and now my daughters are both worried about me telling me to go to the ER. I guess I‚Äôm just kind of venting but also looking for opinions/advice from anyone who has experienced or knows someone who has had something similar at my age?

Since it's quite a small space I think it'd be better to have a couch and a nice decent size coffee table instead of a separate proper dining area (sorry for lack of dimensions I'll try to get the exact numbers). Also I think there is no good place to put the TV and couch across from each other without it being awkward. Please also drop any suggestions of other furnishings besides these 3 things that would fill up the space and tie it together while staying extremely minimal as possible. Bean bag chairs? Rug?

With increasing urbanization, [Farmland Investment in Karnataka](https://dev.saptashwadevelopers.com/) is also becoming a preferred choice for those looking to escape city life and own sustainable assets.

Many questions. And who better to answer them than the free lawyers? You know, the ones lurking around, either twirling their evil mustaches or making sure their hair is pulled so tight into a bun that it‚Äôs actively retreating from their scalps.  

So, with my head held high and my maroon beret strategically covering half my face (because obviously, I‚Äôm better than the legs mortals walking around me), I set off. These people? They aren‚Äôt like me. They never will be.  

## Encounter #1: The Paralegal  

I approached the unit‚Äôs esteemed *Paralegal*‚Äîthe ""Future Lawyer"" himself‚Äîand asked where his boss was. Because let‚Äôs be real, I only speak to *real* lawyers. I‚Äôm important like that.  

But alas, Mr. Future Lawyer informed me that his boss was out getting coffee. *Coffee?* Excuse me? This man is supposed to be doing his job, not indulging in a mid-morning latte run. But fine. No bother. I‚Äôll find a real lawyer myself.  

With a wave and the utmost respect (*goodbye, bitch boy‚ÄîI mean, Paralegal*), I left him to drown in his beloved paperwork.  

## Encounter #2: The JAG Office  

Enough nonsense. Time to go straight to the JAG office. *Hello, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, here I come.*  

I walked in, fully expecting my mere presence to command immediate attention. But what‚Äôs this? No one looks up? No one acknowledges me? Outrageous. I am, after all, the *All-American.* Who are these legs to not drop everything at the sight of me?  

No matter. I would get my answers one way or another.  

Then, the most *rude* woman I have ever met‚Äî*ever*‚Äîlooked up from her desk. She had the audacity to tell me to *sit down and wait* or *leave.* Heh. I *allowed* it. Clearly, she was new. A desk jockey like her would never understand the grit, the sacrifice, the *essence* of being a paratrooper. I mean, just today, I heroically sat on my phone in the woods during a break from sweeping dirt with a broom on a dirt path in the forest. *That‚Äôs* the Army. That‚Äôs service. That‚Äôs HOOAH. Maybe I‚Äôll risk a SHARP investigation and go back to ask her out sometime.

## Encounter #3: The Legal Assistant  

Finally, it was my turn. I stormed into the office of the so-called *Legal Assistant for Military Administrative Matters.* Sounds fake, but sure.  

And then‚ÄîI saw them. The *tabs.* A Ranger tab. A Jumpmaster badge. A *CIB.* Oh. This guy *fucks.*  

At last, I had found a real soldier. Someone who *gets it.*  

And he did. He answered all my questions. And the answer was‚Ä¶ yeah, I was absolutely *screwed* if I got caught.  

But then‚Äîplot twist.  

‚ÄúWhat do you mean it‚Äôs a *good* thing I spoke to you and not anyone else in this building or my unit JAG?‚Äù  

Wait.  

‚ÄúWhat do you mean *no duty of confidentiality*?‚Äù  

Hold on.  

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre *required* to report everything I say?‚Äù  

Oh, it gets worse.  

‚ÄúOnly Legal Assistance, Trial Defense Services, and Special Victims Counsel have client privilege?‚Äù  

Wait‚Äîso my *Unit JAG* is a narc?  

Our *unit paralegal*, that *phony wannabe lawyer*, is also a narc?  

*Everyone* in this building is a narc?  

They represent the *command* and the *Army*, not *me*?  

I sat there, stunned.  

How is it that *no one* ever told us this?  

This‚Ä¶ this is treason.  

This is unfair.  

This is an insult.  

These *villains* who serve this unit‚Äîthese *agents of betrayal*‚Äînever told us they would narc on us.

When I first started watching Sandal it was the early TT days. Honestly she was fun and would make things entertaining doing battles and be at new places. 

However much like my ex I have noticed Sandal having a short fuse that implodes on the littlest things. I‚Äôm not talking about you have OCD and did the dishes wrong, I‚Äôm taking about someone saying how are you? That gets taken the wrong way. My ex had a big thing on tone and all others stupid for just doing normal conversation. 

I have noticed Sandal turn three shades red over people asking questions like what‚Äôs the weather like? Instead of answering like a normal person would, she will say that is the dumbest question I don‚Äôt know why people ask that?

I have heard Sandal say her head is never quiet. If she gets deep enough mad her eyes get very scary. I have seen those eyes. When you try talking to someone in that state they are not in that moment in reality. I have seen Sandal start getting upset because too much is happening in the chat where she can‚Äôt keep up etc. Instead of coming up with options like slow the chat down or take a break‚Ä¶. Sandal starts coming up with the victim mentality. Tears start to try to come but then no actual tears.

Sandal is all about being seen and she thinks she is sexy. If you are so in love with yourself usually that is a sign of narcissistic tendencies. We saw this during Kamerica sking trip where suddenly we learned about a skiing accident Sandal had. She never mentioned it until she realized K America was taken away her chat by her positive fun video.

If someone is truly afraid of skiing they would not play the video on live asking if it was bad? They wouldn‚Äôt play it at all if it‚Äôs a trauma trigger.


I have never once seen her show any empathy. Nor have I seen any accountability. I have seen people with crimes such as hers that have gone on to do good. She acts like the lady she hit was minorly affected. There is no yes I did that but I‚Äôm working to correct it.


She has no family or no true friends. This is hallmark of something is usually wrong with someone if people avoid them. Not to mention the lies that get told about people once close to her.Everyone who wrongs her is bad in some way. Again total narc behavior.

Notice how many people that were once around her that are not. Yes even if she was healthy it is normal for people to fall off. It is not normal to have a trail of bread crumbs that all lead to same ending with one common denominator.

Even though the funny thing is this her live. This is her content. There have been times where I have also observed the way Sandal navigates things. For example, her merch is all run by her mods. Sandal does not even take initiative to do anything. This can also be seen with technology. Her GoPro and Labtop are all essential to streaming. Yet I have heard her say on live that she is autistic.  When someone once asked about the labtop she admitted she does not know how to use it. Not sure if anyone saw her coffee shop live but she was very rough with her computer because a video was taking forever to load on  Youtube. People kept telling her that was normal. Now if she was truly a content creator she would know this. Also if she is truly autistic, they have assisted devices and video tutorials 

I hope people start waking up that this Sandal is unhinged and unwell. Her minions are not helping her by enabling the narc tendencies and BPD rages.",1,1741067146.0,BuffySnark,0,1.0,False

So, it all started with cutting out carbs and sugar entirely... 1 meal a day which consisted of 3-5 eggs, a few pieces of chicken and some veggies.. this paired with an hour of walking and some free hand training helped me lose alot of weight.. mostly water weight but still..
There were some cheat days here and there as well haha #familyevents!

February was slow.. body lost all the excess water weight it could and wasn't feeling the Omad keto diet anymore...so chose to add 2 meals with 100g of carbs everyday to my usual meal  and some high protein peanut butter with some fruit..that really helped me keep more in track with my diet even though I had some slips here and there cause of birthdays haha.. on Feb I decided not to do free hand training and to just focus on getting my 10k steps everyday and it was much easier to stay on top of.. been tracking meals and macros somewhat, mainly making sure I'm always on a deficit.

Still going strong in this Ramadan and hopefully will be able to stick to it for the rest of my life 

Some small advice and thoughts-

1. Drinking water when I'm hungry .it really does work haha.. even better if you can stand black coffee..

2. Just walk if you mean to lose weight.. get those 5-10k steps and you're gold.. everything else is a bonus..

3. My body can't process complex food anymore haha which is really good.. only while foods seems to keep my stomach happy.

4. Getting a small food scale and using chatgpt to keep on top of calories is a game changer..

5. I'm not good with sleep but apparently that helps alot as well..

Probably forgetting many things but oh well..

If you're on your own journey of either gaining or losing do share your story and progress in the comments if youd like... Would love to hear it ..

Ps. On process of getting a home gym, so fingers crossed!!!

I've been married to my partner for 15 years. For the first 10 years we lived 20+ hours away from my MIL, and saw her about every 2 years. When she stayed with us I tried to be good DIL and hostess but I always ended up in tears after two or three days and feeling stupid, worthless, and unwelcome in my own home (she's very frugal and doesn't stay in hotels - we only had a 1bed so she would sleep on the sofa and live in the living room for 2 weeks). 

MIL is generally a very negative person, critical, picking something wrong about everything, like the Rachel Dratch ""Debbie Downer"" character but personal. She's rude to waitstaff/servers, doesn't like indigenous people or Greeks (idk) and complains really loudly about other people in public. Every day staying with us, it was ""You shouldn't have/eat..."" low-fat yoghurt, it gives cancer to rats. full-fat yoghurt, no wonder we're getting so fat. teabags, they're full of microplastics. coffee, it's harvested by enslaved farmers in horrible conditions. blueberries, so many air miles, did you hear about the arctic ice melting? lettuce, the plastic bag will pollute the oceans. tuna, so much mercury. pasta? idk she probably read something about someone getting maimed in a pasta factory somewhere. Move on to the bathroom where there's probably mold in the window, the soap smells weird, she doesn't like the water pressure, the mirror is too small, why do I use that awful toothpaste?? and on and on. Just a firehose of negativity and criticism spraying everywhere.

During the pandemic we moved to her country (where my husband grew up). Huge mistake. My own mother, who I was very close to, passed away in the US and because of the closed borders I couldn't go to her funeral. I gave my mom's eulogy on Zoom while my MIL sat on the sofa in my living room taking calls(?), complaining under her breath that the camera wasn't showing her(??), and making fun of my mom's church's pastor for having an American accent. Like yes my family and I are American, what were you expecting, lady?? Then in the weeks and months afterwards, MIL said some things about my mother and what she passed from (a heart attack after cancer treatment) that still make me furious just thinking about them and I often had to leave to cry, and would keep crying for hours or all night. Some of that crying I know was my overall grief, I was really struggling with being isolated in the new country as well as mourning my mom, but it was still so hurtful. MIL would invite herself along (just show up sometimes where she knew we would be) and plop down and start in on how if I didn't watch myself I was going to end up dead from cancer too and I would deserve it. Once we made plans to meet up with new friends at a nice wine bar/restaurant and she literally invited herself along and stuck her finger in my face when I ordered a glass of wine and said ""you better watch yourself, missy, because that's how you get bowel cancer, and die slowly, and it'll REALLY hurt"". Our new friends' eyes got really big and one of them said ""Whoa"" and I burst into tears and left without eating anything. After that I said to my husband ""this is not OK, and we are making plans to move, and I never want to see or speak to her again"". We have now moved away (though 5 hours away instead of 20+).

My husband says ""it's not OK"" but ""she's always been like that"" and ""that's just how she is, she doesn't mean it"". He says his grandmother always had strict rules about food and he thinks MIL is disordered about eating/food and illness generally. He agrees she's awful to be around, says that's why he moved so far away from her in his 20s, but she's still his mother and ""I can't just not see her"". He offered to talk to her, and ask her to be more thoughtful, but I said no because it felt like she was trying to get at me, and I didn't want her to know how much she was actually getting to me. Also I go back and forth on whether I think she's doing it on purpose or not! Once or twice my husband has said ""\[MIL name\], that's rude"" and she's gone ""Was it?"" in surprise. Another time she went ""oh, SORRR-EEEEE"" really sarcastically. It's like she's clueless/childish, but the thing is she knows exactly where to stick in and twist the knife. But she still texts ""Happy birthday"" and ""Lots of love xx"" and sometimes (like when she's being an asshole to waitstaff) just seems clueless about how she comes across.

So for the upcoming visit:

In 4 weeks she's coming to visit to stay with us for a long weekend (Thurs morning-Mon) and I am absolutely dreading it. The way I was brought up I always try to give grace and give people the opportunity to be better and not just cut them off without talking to them. But I am already feeling sick in my stomach every day, waking up worrying about her, having a hard time falling asleep, and her visit is still 4 weeks away. I've done a lot of therapy about my feelings on her and how she treats me, and worked on boundaries and asserting myself, but it's the first time we'll be seeing her since and I'm just feeling sick. I am trying to make a plan for when she visits. 

Option 1: Boundaries + grey rock + practice

As well as therapy I've been reading a bunch of books and articles on dealing with toxic people, like BIFF, grey rocking. I've been working on boundaries (not for her but for myself - basically - at what point will I politely but firmly nope out of a conversation) and what I'm calling ""Disneyworld princess responses"" where I can just smile and pull them out no matter what garbage things she says. Like: ""How about that!"" (when she says something especially upsetting), ""Huh, it works for us!"" (instead of justifying/arguing when she criticizes), ""Nah, I'm ok!"" (when she asks a pointed question like ""wouldn't you rather wear something else instead of that awful coat?""). This hopefully keeps me from getting upset and keeps the relationship superficially courteous.

Option 2: Try to talk to her beforehand (text or email) or take my husband up on his offer to talk to her.

Something like ""You may not realize but when you came over for my mom's funeral, it was really hurtful to me when you talked all through it, including while I was sharing my memories of her, and made fun of the pastor's accent, especially because it's also how me and my mom talk. It was hurtful in the weeks after she passed to hear you say that people make their own choices and deserve what they get, and for example when I ordered a glass of wine and you stuck your finger in my face in front of our new friends and said I would die painfully from cancer like she just did. It makes me not want to spend time with you. It's hard listening to so much negativity and so personal. Do you think you can commit to not making negative comments when you visit?"" (even just typing this out makes me feel insane lol) This gives her the opportunity to change her behavior, and if she doesn't then at least I can say I tried and walk away.

Option 3: Surprise last minute weekend ""work trip"" for me. To a vacation. Uh-oh, guess I'll miss you this time! (This is obviously my preferred option but my husband said that would be rude. I'm still considering it lol.) 

The thing is we don't actually see her that much and it IS only 1-2 weeks a year. Honestly I would love to just block and ignore - well would love to scream at her about what a huge cow she is, and then block - but I guess I'm struggling because although she has been so horrible, and especially during a time that was so painful, I have something inside me telling me you shouldn't just cut off people without giving them a chance to fix themselves. Is that voice right? I don't know. I know a lot of people have it worse. I just am feeling so sick.",3,1741066678.0,motherinlawsfromhell,4,1.0,False

I live with my both parents.  Being a transman is something I have known my whole life but I suppressed it because of the guilt and shame I feel.

Then 2 weeks ago she told me that me being trans is making her so sad and stressed, I need to go on OCD medication for my gender dysphoria (because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm constantly cutting my hair‚Äù)(yeah cause it‚Äôs dysphoria ‚Ä¶), 
that she is ‚Äúlosing me‚Äù, and that she hates my chosen name and would never call me that. 

Since this incident, I haven‚Äôt been this depressed in years.  
I just randomly burst out crying at any given moment when I remember what she said. I genuinely feel like my heart is breaking in half.  

She was so mean to me most of my teenage years but I decided to forgive her and let go of the hate I held towards her.  Now it has all been reignited and I feel 16 years old again. 
I cannot believe she would say this to me. It hurts so badly.  I am planning on confronting her, I have therapy in a few days.  

Am I bad person for confronting her and telling her how much she has broken my heart? Do I just let go and focus on myself? She is acting like everything is normal and the day after she said those things she bought me a coffee like she felt bad.

I usually am so happy about being trans (as much as I can be besides the crippling dysphoria, you know like Im happy that God made me this way and I see it as a beautiful thing), but now my mom has literally validated to me that I am a monster and my gender dysphoria is something to be suppressed with medication.

Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîcoffee is a band-aid solution for a deeper problem. It's not a healthy energy source, it's just a stimulant that gets slaves through the day by temporarily masking fatigue. It‚Äôs not real energy, it‚Äôs fake energy. And for anyone who‚Äôs on a carnivore diet, it‚Äôs especially frustrating. If you‚Äôre eating proper, nutrient-dense meat, you shouldn‚Äôt need coffee to get you through your day. Meat gives you everything your body needs‚Äîsustained, bioavailable energy from the B vitamins, fats, and protein.

But most people today are relying on coffee just to function, and that‚Äôs because their bodies are starved of the nutrients they need. They‚Äôre stuck in a cycle of needing caffeine because they‚Äôre not getting proper nutrition from real food. That‚Äôs a problem. It‚Äôs a cycle that‚Äôs fueled by the modern, processed food system and the grind of work, and it‚Äôs only making us more dependent on artificial energy sources like coffee.

When you‚Äôre on a carnivore diet, you're getting all the energy you need from your meals. There's no need for caffeine to artificially wake you up or power you through the afternoon slump. If you‚Äôre truly eating what your body is designed for, meat, you should have natural, consistent energy. And if you‚Äôre still relying on coffee, maybe it‚Äôs time to rethink your nutrition and stop masking the real issue.

We‚Äôve been sold the idea that coffee is a necessary part of life, but it‚Äôs just a tool for people who are too dependent on cheap, empty foods. We don‚Äôt need coffee if we‚Äôre fueling our bodies with the right stuff. It‚Äôs time to stop relying on toxic stimulants and start using real food to fuel ourselves.

1j33j0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/1j33j0q/ps4_oceania_servers/,PS4 + Oceania servers,"I live in Melbourne, Australia and own a PS4. My experience of BF2042 is not like most people. I am reliant on Portal *only* as despite having crossplay on and a wired connection I am unable to join any events or default modes given the lack of bandwith, or using a previous gen console or a combination of both. I am restricted to only really playing Conquest modes or Breakthrough (Redacted only) and a few other types, on servers that have been created and likely long forgotten. Some are very niche and basically unusable and most will only have 3-8 humans vs AI to fill the numbers. 

On the plus side, I see regular players crop up quite often which is fun, but when I try to play against a mate of mine, he cannot locate any of the servers I can see. He's on a PS5, also in Melbourne. 

My question is: when creating a server to host, is it platform specific? I can't imagine it is, but if someone who knows about these things could clarify please. It would explain the low numbers but I'm also aware a 4-year old game in this part of the world ('Oceania') may not be tracking well. 

I have a request too please; does anyone have the capacity to create a server in the Oceania region with some different gametypes? Breakthrough for example, on different maps. Rush perhaps? I know I'm asking a lot and will happily buy whomever can help a beer / coffee / 20 bucks for their trouble. 

Cheers! 

TL:DR - are servers platform specific and can someone create some new servers in the Oceania region please and thank you. ",1,1741065442.0,BattlefieldPortal,0,0.99,False

Before that I had trialed Vyvanse and Dexedrine, both which caused me side effects, and my doctor wanted to put me on a non-stimulant instead but I advocate for myself and essentially plead to try Concerta. 

Besides all of my major life stressors last year, it felt like Concerta was doing more harm than good up until this point. I was also drinking coffee in the morning (and multiples time a day), had a poor diet, was struggling with a depression, etc. I'd have insane anxiety, restlessness, and mood swings that made it hard to get anything done. For extra context, I'm a college student, and last semester was very stressful. 

I was self aware enough to recognize how bad my physical and mental health was, and I didn't want to give up on Concerta yet, as I did have improvements in other areas while on it. I was worried my doctor would push non-stimulants onto me again, so I figured I would hold on a little longer until I was able to make changes in my life. 

Recently, I have been grieving someone in my family, and I'm also set to graduate this summer, so I really need to get my semester done. I had therapy last week and my therapist and I spoke about ways I can nurture my pain, rather than run away from it. So I decided that I'd go on a walk every morning for 10-15 minutes, eat breakfast, replace coffee with cup of calm tea, (limit 1 coffee per day), and then take my medication. I'm on day 4, and I saw improvements in the first day. It's absolutely changed my life, and has positively impact my Concerta experience. I feel so much calmer, focused, and confident‚Äîless anxious and more in touch with myself. I've still had breakdowns or moments of frustration, but it doesn't weigh me down much in my body. I'm studying for a lot longer, my mind feels so much calmer, my sentences are clearer, etc. I hope I'm not speaking too soon, because I'm really loving this version of me. 

If you're frustrated with your meds or are experience side effects, I'd highly recommend re-addressing your current lifestyle and starting with one small change everyday. Of course everyone is different, but I just thought I'd share. It didn't take much, but its helped tremendously. And I'm so pleased that I've found a medication that's right for me. ü©∑

TL:DR; Concerta gave me side effects for months, but I decided to reassess my current situation and take a morning walk and avoid coffee in the mornings, which has significantly improved my life and Concerta experience. ",2,1741065328.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Love this community and your videos! My boyfriend joins me once in a while to watch your stories and he suggests I share this story with you. I think of this story as my little petty revenge and a final farewell to cutting out toxic people. 

I‚Äôm not much of a conflict person. I‚Äôm very much a ‚Äúbrush it off‚Äù or ‚Äúnot worth my effort‚Äù type of person, so I don‚Äôt get the desire to be petty that often. 

I (28F), rented a house with two roommates, let‚Äôs call them , Jane (28F)and Mary (28F) back in 2018. We all lived well with each other until the pandemic hit. Just for back story, This happened back in 2020, the first wave of lockdowns were in full swing here in Canada. As hard as the lockdowns were, it really showed alot of people‚Äôs true colours and I ended up losing a lot of people in my life in the first 6 months of the lockdown. That‚Äôs why things fell apart at the house. I was super close with Jane and we had a falling out, thats is a whole other long massy AITA story, that I just don‚Äôt care to share. long story short, Jane wanted me to put her mental health over my own and I just couldn‚Äôt do it cus I was barley holding it together myself. I became her target, she found ways to talk shit and tell stories about me to others people to convince them to cut me out. The stories were so strange or extreme to the point where some people reached out to me to get my side because that ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt sound like me‚Äù or ‚Äúthey were worried for my safety‚Äù. Those who reached out are still my close trusted friends today. Because of all this shit that happened, I felt extremely unwanted and uncomfortable in my own home, I knew I needed to move out. 

Thankfully my BF (30M) has been looking to buy a house before the pandemic hit and we always planned to have me move in. In Aug 2020 he bought our house with a move in date of Nov 1st, so just over three months. The first thing I did was text the house group chat and let them know that I am moving out and that this is a 3 month notice. I was in charge of all the care for the house. I handled all the rent checks, all the utilities were under my name on the accounts, I was the only main point of contact for the Landlady, who was crazy and is a whole other story of its own. I explained in detail how my first and last month rent works and the date that they need to find new roommate for OR if I give the landlord lady a two months notice, asked if they wanted help finding a new roommate and finally gave a long list of what in the common areas belong to me and what they will need to replace once I move out. More on that later.

 By this point in time both of my roommates stopped talking to me and barely acknowledged my existence when I‚Äôm home . So this is the first time they ever replied to me in awhile. Mary, who was super two face during this entire thing, congratulated us on the house and Jane gave a thumbs up. Neither acknowledged all the info I gave them but what ever, idc, I did my part. As the weeks go by I continued to attempt to bring the peace back, trying to have friendly conversations, asking about life, how their BFs are, etc‚Ä¶ to just get either silent treatment or attitude. Near the end of the 1st month I go to Jane and asks how the roommate hunting is going. I remind her that we are getting close to that 2 month notice point if you guys are going to keep the house or not. She told me to ‚Äúfuck off and that she‚Äôs dealing with it‚Äù. What ever, idc, I went back to hiding in my room.  At this time I also transferred all the bills and accounts to Mary and gave the Landlady Mary‚Äôs information to be the new point of contact. I was completely disconnected from the house and just ready to leave once my time was up.

At the 1 month mark I got asked out by a few of my girl friends, who were keeping me in the loop about the lies Jane was saying about me. Jane and Mary  was going around telling people that I was taking the entire house and leaving them with nothing with only a 1 month warning of taking the furniture. I was told she‚Äôs spinning it like the items in the common areas were bought by everybody and I‚Äôm just claiming that they‚Äôre mine to fill my new house. She says I should leave half the items, including the couch cus it‚Äôs not fair they have to replace it in such short notice. I was shocked for a few reasons, first I have it in text that I gave them 3 months notice and a detailed list of what I was taking. But the big shocker was that ‚Äúeveryone bought the items‚Äù, when I actually paid for everything!! Most of the furniture was from my collage house that I bought then and took with me to this house or left over items from my parents when they downsized. Aka all belongs to me. Now, it was true that i was taking majority of the common areas. The detail list includes both the couches and arm chair, bookshelves, lamps, coffee table, the TV ,the sound system ,half of the dish ware, half of the utensils, organizers, game consoles, etc‚Ä¶ only things that wasn‚Äôt mine was decor and I requested they empty that out of the common space so It doesn‚Äôt accidentally get taken. 

Now I originally planned to leave things behind for them, such as a couch,  coffee table and a bookshelf but after hearing they are telling more lies behind my back, I decided to, as our queen potato says, ‚Äúmove in the shadows‚Äù. Our new house was vacant when it was bought so we got permission to get a set of keys so I can move my items in slowly with out stress. My job at the time was close to my new house so I brought a load to drop off every time I went up there. The only things left to move was the big furniture and my cats. I booked a U-Haul and had two of my childhood best friends plus my BF and myself try to Tetris everything in one go. The U-Haul should have fit all my furniture but I seemed to have miscalculated the size, it was not big enough. Remember I mentioned the couch? Now this couch, It was an okay couch, I paid $20 on marketplace for it, but it had this one spot that all the sponge deteriorated in that area and it‚Äôs basically just a piece of solid wood. That solid spot also seemed to magically move around, hurting a lot of peoples asses. My BF reminds me ‚Äúthat we agreed months ago that we were going to buy a new used couch so no point in bringing this crappy couch, they can have the one item they asked for‚Äù‚Ä¶ I disagreed. I made the decision to just not over stuff the truck and do two trips paying about $80 more in kml. In the end we completely emptied that house and moved it all into our new home.

Now this is where my petty moment is, at the time I chose not to block her or the rest of the people who cut me out cus of her lies, off of social media. I did some experiments by posting on my stories over the past month to see if Jane, Mary and those other people look at my stories, they all still did, in a very timely manner. My BF, best friends and I grabbed the couch, put it on the curb, did a mini group photoshoot on the couch and posted it on my stories with captions like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt need this in our new home‚Äù or ‚Äúmeh doesn‚Äôt match‚Äù . They all saw the stories within the first half hr. I blocked Jane right after and the rest I just unfollowed and made them unfollow me and just kept my account private. 

That was the last time I ever talked to them. I heard from the landlady that they called saying they couldn‚Äôt find a new roommate and asked if they could pay only 2/3 of the rent because they couldn‚Äôt afford my portion. She said no. I know they moved out a few months later.  I‚Äôve heard she was complaining about the couch and how it was my fault they couldn‚Äôt find a roommates. For about 3 year‚Äôs people told me she still talked shit about me. To this day, my BF and I still giggle at the photos of us on that couch and the lies she told. 

Other than Jane, at times I missed those friends who believed her, but I am very glad I cut them all out of my life. I never realized how toxic they were until I became Jane‚Äôs target but again that‚Äôs a different story. ",2,1741065292.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

What kind of behaviour is this? 
I kept track of hurtful shit he says.
Backstory: Since Feb 2024 I‚Äôve really struggling with the loss of my father ,my mental health took the turn for the worst. I done something stupid in May 2024 out of guilt I had suicidal ideation and attempted to do a drug overdose along with alcohol. My boyfriend said he still loved me but I felt like the world was crashing. I got to the ER and was sent away to the mental hospital for night. Luckily I got out within one day. Thanks on the behalf of my bf. Now I continued getting the counselling, go to the doctors, currently on long term disability. I used to work as HCA, shift work was hard, doing all the house chores and everything else for my autistic son, my boyfriend, our cat. My boyfriend does a few chores on the weekend because he works full time. It was endless cycle, some shifts I worked til 11pm but get up early to prepare my bf‚Äôs coffee and snacks for work at 6am. Then 7:30 I get my son ready for school. Then do house chores in the morning then rest a lil then went to work at 3pm-11pm. I may have only work a few shift a week but I was exhausted üò© and too my breaking point. Took long term leave it‚Äôs been a long ass recovery ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π some days my bf is supportive other days..he not. I suffer from a hormonal imbalance, anxiety, depression, insomnia, chronic sinusitis, body dystrophia. I understand my bf is tired from work and he an amazing step dad but he says hurtful stuff when my mental issues gets the best of me: 

July 9 2024
‚ÄúMy patience for it is basically non existent now at this point how am I supposed to love you when I‚Äôm annoyed. And if you ever wreck any of my friendship I will never forgive you.‚Äù (This was refer to his long time online friend who used to have a crush on him but has bf, I got insecure because he was messaging her daily on discord they had similar steam games they liked I felt left out, I like her she‚Äôs cool but the lack of attention I was getting from him hurt) 


September 18th 2024 
‚ÄúFor attractiveness def cut the insecurity and controlling out
Because it‚Äôs not attractive 
It‚Äôs more on the sad part
And crazy 
When girls are insecure and controlling, you are destroying a relationship
You are throwing away so much so you can feel at ease 
It doesn‚Äôt help with anyone‚Äôs mentally it‚Äôs basically a band aide‚Äù

I asked him not to watch Sabrina Carptners music videos due to my insecurities and body dystrophia. He got upset because he claimed it to be controlling. But I ask him before not to watch sexualized females on twitch, YouTube, or to follow thirst traps not just because of my insecurities but due to his past porn addiction that greatly effected our sex life. He changed and done what I asked to be respected. I also asked him to delete a discord bitch who was older because they had a past webcam thing. I don‚Äôt care if they were friends for long time, she has bf now and wouldn‚Äôt happend again but it‚Äôs gross and disrespectful. I got uncomfortable with his over online friend who played final Fantasy at first.She knew I existed. I felt so left out because other game they played together like lethal company, phas, dead by daylight, all which I ask my bf to first do an 1 on 1 teaching he refused to just do it with me only. 

What he said on snap chat sept 18th:
‚ÄúGet the fuck over yourself 
I‚Äôm really starting to get mad now
You‚Äôre a fucking leech that drains my mental health‚Äù

Nov24 2024
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making a big deal out of it‚Äù
‚ÄúCry about it‚Äù 
‚Äú Are you still fucking going on about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you seriously crying over it?‚Äù

Feb 13 
‚ÄúYa priorities‚Äù referring to his vape. ‚Äú You should know it‚Ä¶for dating for 3 years‚Äù use of sarcasm because I said his vape is more important than me. 

‚ÄúThere I hope you feel better. Don‚Äôt drag me into it. There you go again letting your brain be stupid. It‚Äôs annoying.‚Äù
  ‚Äú yep I‚Äôm annoyed.‚Äù
‚ÄúQuit talking‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah like the 30th est time you said that..say want you want to say nothing gonna change‚Äù

Feb 22
‚ÄúNo I didn‚Äôt, what do you expect to be all smiling I worked an 11 hour shift. 
I‚Äôll speak monotones for the rest of my life so I don‚Äôt have to deal with this shit‚Äù 
I just notice the change of his tone and was uncomfortable, ran to the room to cry myself out instead of asking right away.

Feb 27 
‚Äú I shouldn‚Äôt take vacations I rather be at work than doing house chores.‚Äù
‚Äú If you‚Äôre not gonna give me a baby, we‚Äôre getting a dog, I need something‚Äù
He took vacation day and he agreed to take my son to school with me and pick him up after school with me too. And I just simply ask to help out the next day clean the litter box and take out the trash.  It‚Äôs was a very bratty immature response. 


Feb 28 

‚ÄúI feel like our relationship will never be 100% again‚Äù 
‚ÄúOur ideologies are too different‚Äù
‚Äú..couple understand each other not cry about it.‚Äù
‚ÄúDo you even know what sarcasm is?‚Äù

This all I ask from him:
-clean Garfield litter box 
-take out trash
-If I cook on a Saturday please clean dishes before bed
-Sunday shower him
-and read him a story 

VACATION days on Henry school days 
-Brush his teeth, wipe his face & around his eyes before school

Almost every single single live online on FB and Craigslist right now is a scam. Of particular note is a scam FB group called ""La Marzocco Used Coffee Espresso Machine/ Used Grinders"" with ""19.4K"" members. It's run by this scammer who uses a brand new account named ""Daniella Judy"" who is the owner of the group and well, they don't even try. Needless to say, I called her out and I got blocked by her and from the group itself. As soon as you put down a deposit, you ain't ever seeing your money or that machine ever again.

Don't fall for these scams. Do your homework, ask for pictures, reverse image search them, and ask for a video call. Ask for the serial number plaque first, then ask for a video call to confirm. If they refuse, like Home-Barista says, it's probably a scam. If it's too good to be true, it more than likely is. The funniest thing is that all of these scammers are just taking photos from each other's posts and trying to pass them off as their own, going full circle.

My hands shook as I zipped up the small suitcase, barely filled with what little I could take. I had planned this moment over and over in my head, but now that it was here, I felt like I couldn‚Äôt move. I wasn‚Äôt just leaving a house‚ÄîI was leaving years of love, pain, and broken promises.

Nick was passed out on the couch, his body limp, a burned-out glass pipe resting on the coffee table beside him. His breathing was shallow, his face sunken in a way that made him look like a shadow of the man I married. I wanted to feel sad for him. I wanted to believe there was still a part of him that could be saved. But the truth was, I had run out of hope a long time ago.

I tiptoed to the front door, my pulse racing. My biggest fear wasn‚Äôt walking away‚Äîit was him waking up before I did.

The first time I caught him using meth, I had screamed. I had cried. I had thrown things, thinking my anger could shake him awake. That was two years ago. Since then, I had watched him spiral into a world I couldn‚Äôt reach. The lies, the paranoia, the violent outbursts‚Äîit had become our normal. I had bruises that faded, but the fear never did.

I gripped the doorknob. My mother was waiting for me outside in her car, her headlights barely cutting through the thick fog of the early morning. My escape was just a few feet away.

Then I heard him stir.

My heart stopped. I turned slowly, praying he wouldn‚Äôt wake up, but then his bloodshot eyes flickered open.

‚ÄúWhere you goin‚Äô?‚Äù His voice was thick, slurred.

I froze, my breath stuck in my throat. ‚ÄúJust out,‚Äù I lied.

His gaze darted to the suitcase. He sat up too fast, blinking hard as if trying to clear the high from his brain. His face twisted into something dark, something I had seen too many times before.

‚ÄúYou leavin‚Äô me?‚Äù His voice was sharp now, accusatory. He pushed himself up, staggering toward me.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I knew that no matter what I said, it wouldn‚Äôt matter. He wasn‚Äôt Nick anymore‚Äîhe was the addiction, the rage, the desperation.

I bolted.

I yanked the door open and ran, my suitcase bumping against my legs. Behind me, I heard him scream my name, but I didn‚Äôt stop. My mother flung open the passenger door, and I jumped inside.

‚ÄúDrive,‚Äù I gasped.

The tires screeched against the pavement as we sped away. I didn‚Äôt dare look back. I was too afraid of what I might see‚Äîtoo afraid that if I did, I‚Äôd lose my nerve and turn around.

Tears blurred my vision, but I refused to let them fall. I had wasted enough of them on him.

I didn‚Äôt know what my future held. I didn‚Äôt know if he would call, beg me to come back, promise to change. But I did know one thing.

I was never going back.

And for the first time in years, I felt free. 

Now as time goes on I wonder, did I do the right thing? Would have things done differently if I waited for Nick to be clean?

Rumours swirl about a massive Trump announcement slated to drop tomorrow, March 4th, 2025. Could the president, king of the unexpected, be plotting the ultimate shocker‚Äîa NATO pullout? Grab your popcorn, readers, because this could be the wildest geopolitical circus yet, and it‚Äôs got everyone from Reddit detectives to meme coin fanatics glued to their screens! Let‚Äôs unpack this crazy saga with $[AmEXIT](https://pump.fun/coin/J9D7h7jqMn5jTwyQtAxcb8GBjjAhjEMVvBuJFi4Hpump)

Imagine the scene: it‚Äôs Monday, March 3rd, 2025, and the digital world is lighting up like a fireworks show. X posts from users like¬†[u/MagaWatchdog](https://www.reddit.com/user/MagaWatchdog/)¬†and¬†[u/CryptoHypeKing](https://www.reddit.com/user/CryptoHypeKing/)¬†are buzzing with hints of a Trump announcement tomorrow night. The big guess? A NATO exit! After 75 years of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization holding the Western alliance together, Trump might just rip the U.S. out of the pact. It‚Äôs the kind of twist that‚Äôd make a sci-fi movie plot blush! With his history of calling NATO ‚Äúobsolete‚Äù back in 2016 (CNN archives).

The setup is pure drama. Trump‚Äôs been throwing shade at NATO for years‚Äîremember his 2018 summit where he berated allies for skimping on defense cash? Or his 2020 dig at Germany‚Äôs spending habits (The New York Times)? Fast forward to now, and 23 of NATO‚Äôs 31 members have finally hit that 2% GDP target‚Äîthanks to his pressure, some say. But recent whispers of Putin talks and a rumored speech have the rumor mill spinning like a top. It‚Äôs like watching a reality TV cliffhanger unfold live! Readers, are you ready to bet on this wild card?

NATO allies aren‚Äôt laughing, though. With Europe jittery over Russia‚Äôs moves, a U.S. pullout could send shockwaves from Brussels to Kyiv. Imagine the headlines: ‚ÄúTrump Ditches NATO‚ÄîWorld Goes Wild!‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of chaos that‚Äôd have diplomats sweating and meme creators rubbing their hands. Polymarket‚Äôs got the odds at 12% by June, but tomorrow‚Äôs buzz might flip the table. Readers, what‚Äôs your take‚Äîcrazy enough to happen, or just Trump flexing his showman muscles?

The Brexit Backdrop and Trump‚Äôs Playbook

Let‚Äôs add some spice with a little history lesson‚ÄîBrexit! Britain‚Äôs 2016 exit from the EU, nicknamed ‚ÄúBrexit,‚Äù was a rollercoaster of sovereignty debates and political popcorn. It kicked off with a referendum vote, spiraled through negotiations, and left the UK waving goodbye in 2020 (BBC archives). Sound familiar? Trump‚Äôs been singing a similar tune with NATO, griping about unfair burdens. He‚Äôs already flexed those exit muscles, yanking the U.S. out of the WHO in 2020, calling it a ‚Äúbureaucratic mess‚Äù (The Washington Post). And who can forget his 2018 summit threat to John Bolton about ditching NATO if allies didn‚Äôt pay up? It makes sense because Trump sees alliances as a business deal‚Äîpay your share or get booted, pure ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù logic. That distrust of global clubs keeps the world guessing, and it‚Äôs a pattern that‚Äôs got allies sweating bullets!

The Hilarious Twist If It Lands

Now, let‚Äôs flip to the fun part! If Trump actually pulls the NATO trigger, this would be hilariously wild! Picture the scene: European leaders clutching their coffee cups in panic, Zelensky doing a double take, and Trump Truth Post: ‚ÄúI TOLD YOU SO!‚Äù. It‚Äôs the kind of absurdity, but here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äî the crypto street says it will send $[AmEXIT](https://pump.fun/coin/J9D7h7jqMn5jTwyQtAxcb8GBjjAhjEMVvBuJFi4Hpump)¬†flying if it does!

Imagine the chaos: Trump drops the news, markets go bonkers, and $[AmEXIT](https://pump.fun/coin/J9D7h7jqMn5jTwyQtAxcb8GBjjAhjEMVvBuJFi4Hpump)¬†blasts off like a firework! The bonding curve on $[AmEXIT](https://pump.fun/coin/J9D7h7jqMn5jTwyQtAxcb8GBjjAhjEMVvBuJFi4Hpump)¬†could push to the moon‚Äîtremendous, folks.

$[AmEXIT](https://pump.fun/coin/J9D7h7jqMn5jTwyQtAxcb8GBjjAhjEMVvBuJFi4Hpump)¬†Soars, What‚Äôs the Next Act in This Circus?

So, what‚Äôs the big picture? say it‚Äôs a long shot. The Senate‚Äôs a tough nut to crack, and NATO‚Äôs recent spending boost might cool Trump‚Äôs jets. But his track record? Wild as a rodeo bull! If he pulls it off, the shockwaves will rock from Washington to Warsaw, and $[AmEXIT](https://pump.fun/coin/J9D7h7jqMn5jTwyQtAxcb8GBjjAhjEMVvBuJFi4Hpump)¬†could be the surprise winner. Traders might dive in for the giggles, pushing the price up as they bet on the madness.

Will $[AmEXIT](https://pump.fun/coin/J9D7h7jqMn5jTwyQtAxcb8GBjjAhjEMVvBuJFi4Hpump)¬†take off like a rocket? Some X folks peg it at a 20% chance; others shrug it off as Trump showboating. Either way, keep $[AmEXIT](https://pump.fun/coin/J9D7h7jqMn5jTwyQtAxcb8GBjjAhjEMVvBuJFi4Hpump)¬†on your radar. If the pullout lands, grab some popcorn and watch $[AmEXIT](https://pump.fun/coin/J9D7h7jqMn5jTwyQtAxcb8GBjjAhjEMVvBuJFi4Hpump)¬†soar‚Äîit‚Äôs gonna be a hilarious, high-flying ride!

Hello my dear friends from the community of delicious coffee lovers. Coffee for me is like the air I breathe, I can't miss it, I always find an opportunity to enjoy a delicious coffee wherever I go. If I visit a place I have to try their coffee, if they make it tasty and pleasing to the eye I give them a high score haha, but if it doesn't meet my expectations I cross it off my list of good places.
This weekend I went with my husband to visit the Hotel Nacional with the main objective of enjoying the pleasant atmosphere of the hotel that has the magic of transporting us back in time a century ago.

The stench of exhaustion seemly clung to all the walls around him as Hubert Humphrey sat at his desk with his holds folded together, listening in hopelessly to the election results. It was supposed to be his night, the night he proved that hope can overpower the smear tactics that Nixon had used his campaign, the night that optimism and triumph can overtake any sort of division and widespread fear, but the numbers told a different story for Minnesota‚Äôs Happy Warrior.¬†

The margins were close and razor sharp but still not enough. The war in Vietnam acted as poison throughout his entire campaign, and the protests outside the DNC hall a couple months before only cemented that image. Nixon, with his hollow promises of restoring order and cracking down on illegal activity, had simply played the game better. Humphrey fought hard to distance himself from his boss and President Johnson, but burden weighed too heavily upon him now. Now as Humphrey watched the final reports go in, the weight had become unbearable.

Humphrey looked back and thought on his father, a man who faced the Great Depression with unwavering resolve. His father had always told the young Humphrey about the promise of tomorrow, and even through the worst times in the nations history, his father still talked about the United States being a shining city on a hill.

Humphrey‚Äôs breathing had shallowed a advisor leaned in and tapped Humphrey on the shoulder, ‚ÄúMr. Vice President, California has officially be called. Maybe it‚Äôs time to prepare a statement.‚Äù Prepare a statement? How do you find the words to concede a dream that you have fought ever since you were alive? He looked around at the faces of his team, they were all tired, defeated, and he searched for some reassurance he could not find. He remembered the words of his father ‚ÄúBefore the fact, there is always a dream.‚Äù It was the line that got him from the dust plains of South Dakota to the mountaintops of American politics.

He stood from his desk slowly, and he gave his signature good natured grin, although, it had been more forced this time. ‚ÄúGentlemen,‚Äù his voice was much steadier than even he expected, ‚ÄúWe gave them a hell of a fight‚Äù. He sat back down at his desk and thought of his entire life, from addressing Congress and being one of the first politicians to advocate for civil rights, to his Vice Presidency with Johnson and the stress of it all. He had spent his entire life fighting for the power of progress and held to the ideal that even with how backwards America seemed at times, it would always move step by step to a society that enabled liberty, equality, and justice for all. Yet here he was watching the nation he had spent his life fighting for take a step backward into a shadow. Nixon‚Äôs shadow.

A phone rang somewhere the background, he knew it was Nixon‚Äôs team making the inevitable, but painful call. He let it ring for a while, a part of him still wanted to resist everything that was going on, just for a moment longer, and just for him to feel his was still in the fight. But he knew better.

¬†

He reached for the receiver, He knew that the campaign was over. But the struggle wasn‚Äôt. Not for Humphrey. Not for this country. **Not for America.**

Out of nowhere in 2022 I started getting hundreds of PVC's per day. I had no idea what caused it, I hadnt changed my diet or daily routine. It was scary and shocking to me and I tried all kinds of things like quitting coffee and all drugs/alcohol, changing my diet, having heartbeat checked at the hospital, and even acupuncture. Nothing worked and I was getting hundreds of PVC's every day for several months. Eventually, sometime in 2023 and into 2024 the PVC's started coming down and although I was still getting them every day I started to notice them less and less.

Well fast forward to 2025 and I am no longer having any PVC's at all. I did not make any lifestyle changes, in fact this year I have (to my shame) been drinking and smoking more than ever before. But for some reason, the PVC's have completely stopped. I havent felt any in several months.  
  
This just validates my belief all along - that there is simply no rhyme or reason for the onset of PVC's. If there is, then only God knows what causes them. 

So if you're going through it right now and it's really negatively affecting your life,  just know that eventually they can stop. I wish you all the best of luck in recovering and living a life free of PVC's. ",8,1741063534.0,PVCs,1,1.0,False

It flashed that the steam wand needed cleaning (i clean it every time, so I'm wondering if it's just an automatic thing). I couldn't clear it, so I decided to put it in descale mode to give it a full.proper clean.

The machine is now stuck in cycle mode 2, it wont take any water from the tank. I'm lead to believe it's an airlock, however I took the base off and tried to blow through the pipe whilst trying to continue the clean mode. I couldn't feel it release any pressure.

I put the base back on and managed to force it out of clean cycle mode, when I press steam i can hear it trying ro take water but all buttons flash indication an empty tank. This also happens if I try and make a coffee. If I turn the machine off and back on again it goes back to stage 2 of the cleaning cycle and gets stuck again.

I'm currently stuck, I have no idea what to do. Can anyone help please? I bought this second hand only 2 weeks ago and I'm quite gutted because it's a damn good machine!",1,1741062977.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

This app does not exist, it is entirely fictional, but entertain the idea of such for a moment, the ability to protest with your wallet when you shop. Only buying in real-time from businesses or manufacturers that meet your standard of ethics and morality, all tailored to the individual user's beliefs, inturn protesting in a way never done before. A powerful tool to bring about accountability and informed decision-making in both personal and societal contexts. By using real-time data and AR, this app could create a completely new way for people to ‚Äúvote with their wallet‚Äù and take a stand in their everyday purchases. But consider the possibility to protest peacefully and meaningfully during hard times.

The Ethical & Financial Transparency AR Application

Potential Social Impact: Empowerment of Consumers: In today‚Äôs world, people often want to make ethical purchasing decisions but lack the transparency or information to do so effectively. This app would put power directly into consumers‚Äô hands. Increased Corporate Accountability: Businesses that face financial loss or a change in consumer behavior might be more inclined to adopt fairer, more ethical practices, knowing that their actions are constantly being scrutinized. Strengthened Movements and Activism: The app could help connect like-minded individuals, fostering stronger social movements by providing easy access to activism-related events and information. Education and Awareness: Beyond simply providing data, the app could educate users about the ethical, social, and political implications of their purchases, helping to build a more socially conscious consumer base. Ethical & Financial Transparency AR Application Executive Summary The Ethical & Financial Transparency AR Application is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize the way users interact with businesses, political donations, and activism. Leveraging real-time data, augmented reality (AR) overlays, heat maps, and secure activism coordination tools, the app empowers users with actionable insights about the ethical and financial behaviors of corporations, local businesses, and organizations. Additionally, the app will provide hate group notifications, alerting users when they enter areas associated with organizations classified as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and similar watchdog organizations. This tool is designed for consumers, activists, and researchers who want to make informed decisions and drive social change.

Transparency & Accountability: Provide real-time access to corporate, political, and ethical financial records. Integrate with Federal Election Commission (FEC) data, state campaign finance databases, and corporate transparency reports to highlight political donations and business affiliations. Include SPLC and Anti-Defamation League (ADL) data to notify users when entering areas with known hate group activity. Ethical Consumerism & User Engagement: Implement a gamified scoring system where users track their spending based on ethical preferences. Offer a personalized dashboard that aligns with individual values and provides ethical business recommendations. Augmented Reality & GPS Integration: Enable AR-powered overlays to visualize ethical scores, labor practices, and financial data on businesses and products. Utilize heat maps and GPS integration to provide geolocation-based insights on corporate influence, activism hotspots, and hate group presence. Grassroots Activism, Hate Group Awareness & Secure Protest Coordination: Provide encrypted tools for anonymous protest planning and event coordination. Implement a community-driven voting system to prioritize activist events based on location and interest. Deliver real-time alerts when users enter areas known for hate group activity, with sourced information from SPLC, ADL, and other watchdog organizations. The ethical consumerism market is expected to grow significantly as more consumers prioritize transparency and sustainability (Forbes, 2024). Augmented reality (AR) adoption in mobile applications is projected to reach $97.76 billion by 2028 (Statista, 2023). The demand for political and financial transparency has increased, evident from the popularity of initiatives like OpenSecrets and FollowTheMoney.org. Hate crime awareness and activism are rising, increasing the demand for tools that track extremist groups (SPLC, 2024). Target Audience Conscious Consumers ‚Äî Individuals who make purchasing decisions based on ethical sourcing, political donations, and corporate responsibility. Activists & Advocacy Groups ‚Äî Organizations and grassroots movements seeking financial accountability and hate group awareness tools. Journalists & Researchers ‚Äî Reporters and analysts who require real-time transparency and extremism data. Politically Engaged Individuals ‚Äî Users interested in tracking political donations and hate group influence from local businesses and organizations. Core Features

AR-Powered Transparency & GPS Overlay Users scan businesses or products to see real-time overlays of political donations, ethical ratings, and sustainability scores. Live data sourced from FEC, state campaign finance databases, SPLC, ADL, corporate reports, and ethical watchdog organizations. Heat maps overlaid on Google Maps highlight areas of corporate influence, protest activity, and known hate group locations.

Ethical Consumer Score & Gamification Users receive a personalized ethical consumer score based on their spending habits. Leaderboards, badges, and rewards incentivize users to make ethical purchases. AI-powered recommendations suggest businesses and products aligned with user values.

Protest Planning, Hate Group Alerts & Activism Coordination Anonymous event creation allows users to organize protests without compromising security. A community voting system prioritizes events based on urgency and relevance. Geofenced notifications alert users to activism opportunities and hate group presence in their vicinity.

Real-Time Notifications & Alerts Users receive proximity-based alerts when near businesses with controversial affiliations or ethical concerns. Hate group warnings notify users when entering areas with known extremist group activity. Live protest safety updates and encrypted messaging ensure user security.

Heat Map Technology & GPS Integration Color-coded heat maps visualize regions with high business donations, protest activity, hate group influence, and ethical hotspots. Toggle layers allow users to explore different financial and activism data in real time. Historical tracking of business donations and hate group movements provides long-term transparency.

Data Sources & Verification Federal Election Commission (FEC) ‚Äî Political donations at a federal level. State Campaign Finance Databases ‚Äî Local political donation records. Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) & Anti-Defamation League (ADL) ‚Äî Hate group locations and extremist organization tracking. Corporate Transparency Reports ‚Äî Ethical sourcing, labor practices, and environmental records. Crowdsourced Verification ‚Äî Community-driven data contributions to ensure accuracy. Implementation Roadmap Phase 1 (6 months): Core app development, AR integration, ethical consumerism scoring system. Phase 2 (9‚Äì12 months): Activism coordination tools, anonymous protest planning features, hate group alert system, heat map visualization. Phase 3 (12‚Äì18 months): AI-driven insights, historical trend mapping, business partnerships. Transparency in business and politics is no longer a luxury ‚Äî it is a necessity. The Ethical & Financial Transparency AR Application provides real-time insights into corporate and political affiliations, empowering consumers and activists with knowledge. By combining augmented reality, financial data tracking, hate group alerts, heat maps, and activism tools, this application reshapes how users engage with their world.

How It Works: Real-Time Business Transparency ‚Äî Users scan a store, and AR overlays display past political donations, ethical concerns, and alternative businesses. Heat Map Transparency ‚Äî Color-coded heat maps highlight financial donation trends, protest activity, Political Party voting records for the town/community, as far and up to public information of arrest records and hate group clusters awareness when driving or entering an area. Hate Group Awareness ‚Äî Users receive real-time alerts when entering areas associated with extremist organizations, individuals listed in the neighborhood, or specific candidates/parties. Anonymous Activism & Protest Coordination ‚Äî Encrypted tools allow users to organize, vote on, and join activist events based on proximity. By merging financial transparency, activism, and hate group awareness into one AR-powered platform, this application empowers users to make impactful decisions daily.

Monetization & Sustainability: Develop revenue through premium subscriptions, that reward users for shopping and sourcing things locally, ethical business partnerships, and advertising models for verified businesses. Establish crowdsourced data contribution rewards to ensure up-to-date and accurate information and expansion of source. Consider this for a moment, that, this app could bring a new wave of financial activism ‚Äî where every purchase becomes a conscious decision to support or protest a company‚Äôs practices. It would blend technology, consumerism, and activism in a seamless, data-driven way. What are your thoughts on how such an app could evolve in the future?

The Ethical & Financial Transparency AR Application represents a groundbreaking intersection of technology, consumerism, and activism, offering a powerful new tool for individuals to exercise their values and make a real-world impact with their purchasing decisions. By leveraging augmented reality, real-time data, and geolocation tools, the app not only promotes financial transparency but also empowers consumers to hold businesses accountable in ways never before seen.

In the future, this app could evolve into a cornerstone of ethical consumerism, fundamentally changing how we approach shopping and social movements. As data accuracy and the app‚Äôs ecosystem expand, it could develop into a comprehensive platform where businesses, regardless of size, would be incentivized to adopt transparent, ethical practices in order to attract a conscientious customer base. This could result in widespread shifts in corporate behavior, with companies increasingly aligning their practices with consumer values in response to the growing demand for accountability.

Moreover, as this platform gains traction, it could integrate deeper AI-driven insights, helping users refine their purchasing decisions with even more precision, offering predictive analytics based on personal values, location, and social trends. Future iterations could include partnerships with environmental groups, further enhancing sustainability practices, or add features that allow users to share or broadcast their ethical decisions, encouraging a greater collective awareness.

The app‚Äôs potential for peaceful protest and coordination, coupled with the ability to warn of hate group presence and encourage local activism, would create a unique blend of personal empowerment and community-driven social change. Imagine a society where each purchase ‚Äî whether at a coffee shop or a big-box retailer ‚Äî becomes a statement of your ethics and a force for greater societal change.

This platform could also evolve to incorporate more personalized features, like a ‚Äúcultural impact score,‚Äù based on how a user‚Äôs choices affect societal issues such as racial equity, environmental sustainability, and labor rights. Additionally, it could open up space for more grassroots movements by enabling small businesses to join the network, strengthening local economies while encouraging ethical practices.

In essence, the app could become a global movement that turns every transaction into a meaningful expression of personal beliefs, providing consumers with the power to protest peacefully through their wallets. It‚Äôs a compelling vision for a future where every dollar spent not only has a personal impact but also contributes to the larger goal of social responsibility, transparency, and ethical accountability.

The future of the possibility of such a platform could be transformative, acting as a catalyst for a new wave of financial activism and reshaping how we view the relationship between commerce, ethics, and activism.",0,1741062835.0,economy,0,0.5,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j32m8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1j32m8k/i_am_thinking_of_doing_a_contikitopdeck_group/,I am thinking of doing a contiki/topdeck group tour across Spain and Portugal? I would love to hear peoples thoughts/experiences on doing group tours in Spain/Portugal as opposed to Solo Travelling?,"Hi all

I am 26 year old Australian guy thinking of doing a Group Tour across Spain and potentiallly Portugal during either May,June or July. I have only travelled Asia before, but never really been to Europe, and since its first time in Europe, I was thinking of doing a group tour. I just wanted to get people thoughts on travelling to Spain on a group tour as opposed to travelling solo.

If I was to give a brief summary of my personality, I would say I am half extroverted and half introverted. I am quite social and do like to meet new people and make new friends, go to bars, potentially go to a nightclub (i do enjoy spainish music). But I also do have have a quiet side, and would prefer to stay in my own room rather than in shared accomodation, and I wouldn't want to make the focus of my trip around going partying and getting drunk everynight. Ideally, my main hobbies on a trip include:  
\-Finding good food and coffee  
\-Occasionally finding a good bar/nightlife (not something I would want to do every night thought)  
\-Meeting new people.  
\-Exploring the cities and exploring nature - I would love to find a good swimming spot or something.

The benefits I could see from doing a group tour could include:  
\-having a set plan and itineary  
\-being around a guide that is familiar with the culture, language, go to spots in a city. (I unfortunately cannot speak Spainish)  
\-being more safe in a foreign country  
\-Having more people to socialise with and make friends.

I have done a few groups in Asia, some have been great but others I haven't really enjoyed. The two main disadvantages I could think of include:  
\-Sometimes feeling rushed and not having a just chance to explore a city at your own pace.  
\-Occasionally, being in a group that you do not reallly gel with (I've never really had this happen). But given my age, I know some group tours like G adventures and topdeck have older crowds (30-40) and contikis have younger crowds (18-22), so I am not sure if I would be on a trip with people my age.

I know especially the two factors that I mentioned above are common for group tours that try and squeeze mutliple countries in europe in a short time span. My preference is to properly explore one or two countries, rather than only getting a short time in 10 different countries. Usually, when I travel my preference is to go with friends. But unfortunately, none of my friends are able to go with me at the moment, so the options would be a group tour or solo travel.

For those who have done a group tour around Spain or Portugal such as a contiki/top deck or any other tour, I would love to hear your experiences, recommendations, do/do nots etc...

I'm not sure how to do flair and I'm too tired to do anything else tonight but If theres anything I need to fix please lmk!)

Hey everyone. I don't really know how to start this, and my brain is everywhere. I guess I'll start by saying that I (30) have had an unstable and confusing life since I was seven. I cannot describe in words the extent of how it's been one thing after another for me since then. I'm sure many of you know what I mean. I lost my beloved dog on Friday, so that's been an added layer of grief on top of everything else I'm trying to process at the moment.

Apologies ahead of time for how long this ends up being. I'm trying so hard to keep it short but there's just so much! TLDR; pretty sure mom's a narc of some kind. need some perspective. life has been awful! finally realizing the extent to which my mother is responsible for my inner turmoil and not something innately wrong with me

I literally just got back from a week at my grandma's, taking care of her after surgery, and then we realized the dog was really sick. That week before, however, was largely impactful for me. I have been so confused for so, so, so long, trying to make sense of everything, trying to do right by everybody, including myself. In the first couple days at my grandma's I was scrolling Facebook and saw an old friend of my Mom's online. She was very similar to my mom, in my mind. They knew each other from working as civilians on the same military base, and we'd sometimes have her and her kids over for BBQ type events. We only really had these events right after my mom remarried to my step dad, around 11-14 years old. I looked through her Facebook and realized, to my pleasant surprise, that she was vehemently a queer and neurodivergence ally. This made me really happy, and I felt this pull to message her, so I did.

I wasn't sure what to expect. I basically just, poured my heart out to this lady. I tried to keep it short, but it's so hard to keep it short when nobody's listened to you in so long, and you think maybe, just maybe I found someone who will hear me.

Her response had nothing to do my parents, despite my message having *everything* to do with them. Her response healed twenty years of trauma in one go. It was like, it was all I was waiting to hear. It's all I needed to hear. She told me I was safe now. To bring awareness to the safety and love I have today living with my partner and her mom.

""And stand up so fucking tall, you did that on your own!!! DESPITE the world trying to actively stop you!!!""

""being a fucking genius neurodivergent kid in the early 00‚Äôs is no fucking small feat.  The world was trying to standardize our kids, and you refused to conform to the mold.  If you cant conform, you‚Äôre ostracized and bullied.""

These were the two gems that broke me. No adult who knew me personally expressed anything close to this to me, except for my Dad, who I lost in 2022. To have someone who was so close to my mom say these things, it broke my heart because it really drove the stake home that my mother has never spoken such kindness to me.

She gives me some reading material, ""The Body Keeps Score"" and ""Out of The Fog""

I forget which one is by Dana Morningstar, but I decided to start with her first book that same night, ""Start Here: A Crash Course in Understanding, Navigating, and Healing From Narcissistic Abuse""

I didn't need to finish the book to finally feel peace. I realized pretty quickly, and finally had to admit to myself, that yes, my mom is a narcissist. From what I've read she'd be classified as a covert narcissist, but I don't know if that's right.

I do know that I was 11 when I realized my mother and step dad did not base decisions off of logic and reason, my thoughts and feelings had no impact on anything, I had to get out of this, and college was my ticket. ""6 years. That's a long time."" I remember thinking. And then I counted down the years, and did everything I could to do what I needed to for college. The journey from then to now was so, so, so long, and desperate, and lonely. When my mom remarried when I was 11, my grandma moved out, and then I remember my existence just being *torture*. But not in any way I was ever able to communicate to anybody. I never had the words to describe my experience. My mom didn't let me have emotions growing up. If I was sad, it was be sad somewhere else, or I'll give you something to cry about. Or ""you're fine"". Maybe I am fine, I don't know. Is this normal? I don't know. Mom, my tummy hurts. ""You're fine."" Oh. I guess that's normal. I guess this is all normal, I can just ignore it. ""Mommy's are always right."" So I guess she's right, right? I can trust her, right? Then why does it hurt so much? Why am I so sad? Oh. I just need to get over it. I'm fine.

Over time I lost any ability to identify how I was feeling emotionally and physically, and to be honest, I have no idea how good I was at it in the first place. I'm pretty sure at this point I'm on the spectrum, not that it matters now, but there were so many signs I was struggling in multiple ways and she never got me help.

in 8th grade she found out I was cutting. I had been doing it for a couple years, after this kid at PE showed me his. I didn't know that was an option. Suddenly I had an outlet for how much pain I was feeling inside. And I could feel something, something tangible, something real. Somebody couldn't tell me what I was feeling wasn't reality, maybe. And so then when she found my arms, finally, after years, I couldn't keep a smile from creeping on my face. Finally, finally she'll understand how much pain I'm in, how I need help, I'm going to get help!

But instead she grounded me.

So I tried letters. Maybe she just, can't listen to me when we talk, but she'll read my words and know. ""Mom, I need help, please. I'm scared for my safety if I don't get help soon."" Things like that. Put in the trash.

in 10th grade I went to the art therapist I saw freshman year, and showed her my feet. I was a chronic flip flop wearer and always cut on my feet, hoping somebody would see it and report it. Nobody did, even though I knew they saw it. So I went to her, and had a breakdown. She called my mom to the school, and said I needed to be evaluated. So it was off to a therapist. In hindsight, my mother only did this because the school would've called CPS on her at this point if she didn't. A similar situation happened with my younger sister, I would find out years later, only they actually threatened to call if she didn't take my sister to therapy.

Finally got to a therapists office. Was diagnosed as 'moderately to severely depressed'. Instant relief, because yeah, I thought I was pretty fucking depressed too. In subsequent years I've also been diagnosed with GAD, social phobia, PTSD/C-PTSD, and ADHD. I was wrongly diagnosed and medicated as bipolar 2 for ten fucking years, but that's a different post entirely.

Therapy didn't last long. They recommended my Mom and I spend one Saturday a month together, and I was *stoked*. I wanted to spend time with my mom so bad. We made it a month. The next month I asked, when are we? And she laughed and said ""Oh, we're not doing that anymore."" As if I was stupid for even bringing it up. But my mom loves me. Right? So this is fine, right? But it's not. But maybe I'm missing something.

Somewhere in there I ended up in my first and only hospital hold. I think the therapist who diagnosed me with depression suggested I go, so I went in on a 72 hour voluntary hold. The doctors couldn't figure out why I was there or why I was depressed (I had no good way to communicate this.... what am I supposed to say? ""it's my mom, she's, mean?"" I mean, idk! I don't know which parts of her behavior aren't normal or that her behavior was impacting me so much). My mom refused to let them put me on any medication. I was still horribly depressed. I hope by this point you understand I was not ""depressed"" but ""actively suicidal"". Like, every day for as long as I could remember. I would lay in bed at night in high school and contemplate how to get roof access to the skyscrapers downtown, as jumping from large height was my preferred way to go out. It was on my mind *constantly*. I honestly don't know how I stayed here except I kept finding reasons I had to hold on. I couldn't bear the pain of my siblings losing me and leaving them all alone to my parents, primarily.

The doctors said if I didn't start showing improvement soon, they'd have to keep me over the weekend. Which meant not getting out until at least Monday, which meant missing school. This had all happened at the tail end of the week so I was able to not miss my classes too much. But I was in AP World History. And I need a good grade for college applications, and I'll fall behind quick, so. I said ""Yep everything is fine actually! All in my head, all good! I just needed a good night's sleep :)"" I wasn't even good at pretending! It was so performative, and they looked at me skeptically, but I was still released after my hold. If they weren't going to help, I'm not going to let my damn grade tank. Then my mom guilted me about the cost of my stay (iirc it was $200 a day after insurance).

Junior and senior years I kind of lived this double life, but at the same time. I was trying to be what my mother wanted, this feminine, well-rounded girl who does everything she's asked with a smile and good grades and perfect. And we were actually the closest we ever were during those two years. And then there was the me I was trying to be. I was branching out with my clothes style, trying to wear more masculine clothing. I was binding in secret (with blue painters tapeü§¶no lecture needed, i know, i know. this was before all the resources we have now!). My friends and I took over as presidents of our school's Gay-Straight Alliance, and I started spending a lot of my time running that and doing outreach with other schools etc. I honestly did so fucking much y'all have no idea!! I was on the paper since freshman year. First as Entertainment Editor, then the next year I was that and Photography Editor. My junior year I was Assistant Editor and Photography Editor. Senior year I was Editor-In-Chief (although I quit shortly after due to a dickhead advisor, ANOTHER story!). Because of that, I knew everyone on campus. I was a library assistant and helped them with the transition to the newly built library. I did photography. I was on the swim team junior year, me, someone who thought they were fat and unathletic and could never do something like that. I did it! I was on a fucking sports team. That meant *so much* to me. Everything I did in high school meant so much to me.

My mom never supported me? I mean I don't know how else to put it. She always asked for a copy of my paper but never read it. She made me walk home from practice, walk home from meets. She never came to see me swim. One time my step dad did, but he missed my heat because he was in the parking lot on the phone with my mom.

Another weird thing!!! My step dad has never had a conversation with me and everyone acts like its normal! He would yell at me before I left home, but since I became an adult, it's like he can't even acknowledge I'm there. Instead of saying ""Hey OP, do you want some eggs?"" he'll instead turn to one of my younger siblings and go ""Hey X, if you and OP want some eggs theres some here in the kitchen"" or something to that effect. He acknowledges me with a hello and a hug whenever I arrive and leave my mother's house to visit, but in-between it's like I'm hardly there. He's not mean about it, just like. Weird! I only remember one conversation we ever had and it was on the way to get my permit when I was 16, we talked small talk like college or about the test. But then I didn't pass and it was dead silent on the way home.

I did go to college. I got into many good ones! My SAT was either 1560 or 1650 (I want to say the latter but it's been over ten years so take that with a grain of salt) back in 2012, right before they changed the scoring. If that means anything to anybody. I got into San Diego State University as a San Diego resident, which I'm under the impression is kind of hard to do? I wasn't good enough to get into like UC Berkley or anything, but I was an honor grad. My folks were upset when I said I was going to college upstate, as I had planned since 9th grade. I loved my college town. I was able to figure many things out. I switched my major to Psychology and got very close to finishing, but I just. Could not for the life of me find a job in town. I don't know if it was over saturation or if I was a hot mess, but most likely both. My mom kept saying I was lazy, I wasn't trying hard enough. I ran myself ragged. I applied to every single storefront in the town, in my interview outfit, with resumes handy, and called back at every single place. So she couldn't say I didn't try. And I got no interviews. And she didn't believe me.

I was living in a studio in a college town in upstate CA when I solemnly took a bike ride down to the park, up to the creekside. I sat at my favorite spot, on one of the benches, and looked sadly at the water and the pebbles beneath it. I had been depressed for so long, sad for so long. It was Christmas 2017. For the first time I started writing a suicide note. I had tried so hard to make all this anguish go away, to feel better, to stop treating the people around me so erratically. I just wanted to know what was *wrong* with me. For so long I just felt all this *wrongness* coming out that I just wanted to find out what it was so I could fix it... so I could be better, healthier. So I was easier to love, because it seemed like it was so hard to love me. I didn't know why, I loved my mother so, so, *so* much. What did I do that she treats me so vile?

I was planning my exit. I had secured a job through a state-funded non profit where I would be a one on one childcare assistant for a five year old with behavioral issues too dangerous to have her around other children on a regular basis. I worked for her foster mother, who would eventually adopt her. I was guaranteed a job, I was so happy. I was making money again. She cosigned on a studio for me. She ghosted me. I was left in the lurch. I couldn't find a job. I couldn't find a job. Eviction notice. I sell all my things to pay rent. Eviction notice. I take out a credit card to pay rent. It's not enough to cover the month. Another eviction notice. I was literally starving. I was malnourished, living on whatever the food pantry on campus would give me. But then I had to drop out of school, so I could focus on finding a job. So I couldn't use the pantry anymore. I lived on primarily oatmeal, peanut butter, white rice, raw almonds, and coffee. If I was lucky I would be able to afford some butter so I could make those noodle meals in the pan. I had to substitute the milk for half butter half water because I could rarely afford milk. I used whatever I could for my coffee. Powdered milk, hot chocolate mix, chocolate syrup, maple syrup, almond milk, whatever I could get my hands on for cream and sugar. Coffee was one of the rituals that kept me sane. Canned fruit was the biggest delicacy because there was hardly any. When I'd come in and some would be in stock, it was really, really hard not to take all six cans. It might be the only fruit I can get for weeks. I took my allotted two.

My family knew how I was living. I knew I was always welcome back at my mom's. I knew that was a death sentence for me, like it had been before I left. It was a non-option to me. To return home is to die. I was prepared to be homeless if it meant not going back to my parents, but I was going to take my exit before it got that far. My sister told me in the past year or so that my mom told her that she let me suffer like that on purpose to punish me for not deciding to stay at home, and basically for making decisions different than what she wanted me to do.

My grandma called me that Christmas. It was a typical grandma conversation. Merry Christmas, etc. I'm killing myself soon, I thought. I'll miss you grandma, I thought. We get off the phone and I smoke another cigarette, sitting on a strip of the asphalt parking lot that overlooked the creek. Grandma calls me back. She felt like something was wrong. I don't remember exactly what was said or what followed from there. A week later I was living with grandma on the other side of the country. By the time this happened, I was so sick and delirious. I packed in a fog. I took a suitcase and shipped the rest USPS in ill-packed boxes. I lost 2/3 of my stuff in the mail. I get to grandma's. I get a job at a gas station. I pull myself out of debt. I get robbed at gunpoint at the gas station late at night during shift change for my solo graveyard shift. This is fine, this might as well happen. I stay at home for about a month. Grandma loses her job. I start working at Panera. Grandma gets a new job. We're making ends meet. I walk out of Panera because assholes managers, asshole corporate. Have another breakdown. See my partner for the first time during all of this (Godsend she is). Start working at a coffee shop. Get my groove. Still depressed as fuck. Slowly continue to climb out of debt. Sister moves in with me and grandma a couple times at this point and she eventually settles into the coffee shop with me. Sister and I don't get along well because she's so much like my mom. Kinda ruined grandma's safe space. Pandemic happens. I go to mom's for like 6 months to take care of my two youngest siblings, make sure they don't fall behind with remote learning. Proceed to have a ton of fun with my sisters. Trying to get along with my mom. See, the trick is girls, just dont talk to her or make noise and she'll let you exist in the same room! :)

At her house when 2020 election happens. I'm literally in a fucking airplane when Jan 6 happens. Land. Decide it's time to move in with partner (she'd been trying to get me to for years). Finally move in, whole other like. Mountain of information. I'm so sorry this is all over the place, I literally. Have no context for what's important or not. It's all related. I have no idea which parts should be included, so I hope I'll be forgiven.

Move in with partner. My dad dies. Whole other situation I can't get into here, but he was the only adult who cared about me, my best friend, and his death was drawn out and traumatic. She cannot allow a conversation go by where he is brought up without mentioning how he's bad actually.

We hate where we live. Want to move. Mom is bringing up every conversation how we shouldnt move, now is a bad time to move, etc. Like the town's water is making us lose hair mom.  Move takes more than a year because its literally just me, my partner, and her disabled mom. We're broke. We're tired. My partner and I have our own disabling conditions. Just so stressful and alone. Finally the start of this year, got into the new place. We love it. It's everything we needed. We needed to be here, I needed to be here. I feel like I arrived, I see dad in the sky and know I'm home.

Before I was 7, I was a really happy kid. Very outgoing, friendly, goofy, not a care in the world. I played with anyone who wanted to play. I collected rocks and filled my overall pockets to the brim with them. I would pick up worms and name them all junior. I liked going next door to the ice cream man to get a choco taco, even if it cost more when his kids rang me up. I liked tying knots in things. I liked the computer. I liked my barbies. I liked hanging out with dad in the garage, and watching simpsons.

The summer I turned 7 a man knocked on our front door. When mom opened it, he introduced himself as my dad. I was confused. I already had a dad. This was my biological father, my mom said. I went out with him. I wasn't going to say no to someone being nice. We went to the fair. That summer my mom got out of the military, so I had to switch to a public school closer to home. I had to start taking the bus. The kids there weren't as nice as the ones whose parents worked with my parents.

In September, we move to California. The following April, I ask my mom. ""when's daddy coming?"" for some reason i remember her laughing. she said ""oh, he's not coming. we got a divorce."" my entire world shattered. she pulled me from my daddy and didnt even tell me for months. at my new school, I was bullied so, so badly, by not just students, but justified by my teachers and the principal. I went from outgoing to withdrawn. I came home from school crying every day. My mom pulled me from school in the spring of 3rd grade, and I didn't go back. in 4th grade we had moved again and I was in a new school, with a new district.

I told my mom when I was an adult that I was being molested by a kid a few grades ahead of me, who rode the same bus and lived up the street. First time I told her she said ""That didn't happen."" Shattered. Second time I told her she said, ""That couldn't have happened, you were never in a position where there weren't eyes on you."" I was alone constantly. When I was 3 I was found wandering the neighborhood (I had gotten turned around and couldn't recognize my street) and it wasn't until a neighbor with her kid saw me and guided me to a nearby police officer that my parents even realized I was gone. He gave them a stern talking to, but. It didn't change anything, did it? After I was pulled from school especially, I just wandered the neighborhood. Going into whoever's house that would have me. But it *couldn't* have happened? Then she said it wasn't that bad. That's normal for kids, to experiment.

It started really sinking in how fucked this all really was once my youngest sisters started growing up. She's the age I was when this happened. Would this be okay to happen to her? I would imagine little 8 or 9 year old sister experiencing what I experienced, telling them what I was told, and I just couldn't even stomach it. How does someone treat their child so cruelly? How could she say she loves me?

I felt like my mother's slave. I was expected to clean the entire house ""spotless"" every week, and the kitchen ""spotless"" nightly. Not picked up, not clean, spotless. And she corrected me every time until it met the standard and I knew what she expected. I was constantly behind in chores. I was so tired. She never trained the dogs so they always pissed on the floor so she cordoned them off to the kitchen/back door area with dog gates. which just meant the kitchen floor was constantly greasy. I hated cleaning the floors the most because they never got clean, they were always a bit greasy. I had a sister born around 2010 and another around 2012. In my last two years of high school I got up at 5:30 to get them ready for daycare for my mom. After school I would make sure they ate, clean them up, change diapers, do baths, get jammies on and brush hair, tuck in bed, read a few bedtime stories, dealt with them if they didn't go to bed on time. And I was on the honor roll with AP classes. And electives. And a sport. And I kept the house spotless, as spotless as you can with a household of two adults, a preteen, and two toddlers who dont pick up after themselves in any way. How I managed to get out of the house at all is a mystery to me. And when I'd be out, I'd be inevitably called back early to clean or watch the girls. So they could (checks notes) go to Target and then drink tequila and chain smoke in the garage. I've felt like a 30 year old soccer mom with 5 kids since I was 13. Like this specific thing. And now I *am* 30, and. Yeah. I was definitely doing like three whole ass full time jobs as an adolescent. I dont know how I did all of that.

At some point they started paying me an allowance of $100 a week, with 50 to keep and 50 in savings they were keeping for me for college. Yeah, I know, that's a decent chunk. It's slave labor money when you think about the actual work I was doing. the 50 i kept went fast when im sad and i have barely a life, so honestly most of it went directly into dominos medium pan pizzas ngl. At some point I told them how about i stop doing all of this for you and you stop paying me, and they laughed and were like ""No you can do it for 50 a week or you can do it for nothing but you're doing it either way."" OKAY

Since leaving home at 18 I've had PTSD nightmares about my parents HATING me. Like just. The hatred and disdain that I exist dripping off of them. And in the dream there would be other family members who also just hated me, no love at all. I would be so upset and angry and confused in these dreams. I would wake up so messed up in the head from it and it would make me feel funky the entire day.

I seriously thought I was so crazy, I thought it was ME. üò≠ I tried to give my mom so much grace. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. I've spent years piecing together her life and trying to understand her perspective, trying to reach her, trying to get us to a point where being around her doesn't hurt so much. I LOVE my mom, unconditionally. Or, I love my mommy. I love who I thought she was. I don't even know who she is at this point. I don't know who I thought she was but she's just. A completely different person. Deep down I knew it was narcissism. But with so much doubt and downplay and guilt you think I must be overreacting, don't label her like that. She's bad, but she's not a *narcissist*. She loves you!

No. I was right at 11. It was my mom. It was always my mom. She sabatoged me over and over and over again. She expected the world of me and when I brought it, it wasn't enough. Nothing I ever did was enough. I was being constantly grounded for ???? drummed up reasons. I missed out on so much. I suffered so much, trying to get her to prove her love, to show it.

Reading that book, and doing subsequent research on narcissism, has given me a tremendous amount of peace. I was in such inner turmoil, always asking myself what I could do better, where I went wrong. Now I know, nothing. There was nothing I could've done better, there was nothing I did wrong. There's something wrong about the way she sees and interacts with the world and now I finally understand what it is. It makes me so sad though. I have to go no contact with her. I didn't *want* it to be like this. I tried so so hard for things to be different, to play into a different reality. But the truth is, my mom doesn't want to change. And she lowkey fucking hates me, hates me for all the ways I'm not what she wanted. Hates me for all the ways I've been able to grow without her. Hates me for moving out, for immediately getting my own bank account and transferring all my money into it (thank god i fucking did this!!!). Hates me for being trans. Hates me for being neurodivergent. Hates me for talking about it. Willing to let me suffer. Happy to watch me suffer. Content to watch me kill myself.

I was in such denial, because I simply dont *have* anyone else. I have a couple aunts and a few cousins who have shown interest in making sure im okay, but that's it as far as Capable Adults Older Than Me Who Could Help Me Not Die. I want a parent, yknow? My bio dad is a fucking mess of a human because of his own upbringing, and I love him, and he's my biggest fan, but he's too self absorbed in his own crap to be of help. He can't help but bring it all back to him. I had MY dad, my daddy. He was always there for me. He knew we were one in the same when he met me at 2. I don't know why he was so depressed. He had been an alcoholic since he was 12. Did his 20 in the military and then was called out of retirement for his dream job on a base. But I think he was getting disillusioned about what he was doing, who he was training. What they were using that training for. He died during the pandemic. Maybe complications from covid. Maybe he just gave up. It was the worst day of my life.

I got my puppy boy about 9 months after his death, and finally felt like living again. I had my boy. I had my partner. We got our house ready to sell. Sold it. Moved. So, so much happpened in the past year and a half alone. And we're finally here, we finally made it. And my boy is dead. And my mom is a narc. And I feel so, so fucking sad.

If you read this mess of a post... thank you. I guess I don't really know why I'm posting. Because you lot won't tell me it didn't happen, wont tell me I should forgive my mom, that she's my mom, she should stay in my life. I need to hear from people who *dont* feel that way. Who can look at some of the big events from my life I've laid out and give me some perspective on how fucked up this is. It's not even the half of it lmao but. I got to see my dog today and say goodbye. Last time I saw him was Friday when he left for the vet, and he was alive. There's so much to process. I'm so sad. I'm so content. I'm happy. I'm not confused anymore. I'm so so so so sad. I miss my dad so so much. So much as happened since he died that I wish I had his opinion on. I miss my boy so fucking much. I accidentally broke one of my favorite mugs in my haze tonight. Everything is going to be okay, everything is moving forward as planned. But tonight I'm just so fucking sad.

Thank you for helping me not feel so alone tonight. Any comments, questions, advice, perspective, literally any feedback is appreciated. Maybe in the morning I'll be more coherent. If you read all of this, thank you for taking some of the weight off my shoulders. My back really hurts haha. Sorry again if this is just a garble of words!",3,1741062153.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I started as an intern, went through a 14 month rotational program and am now an analyst on a team. Since an intern I‚Äôve felt my company was bs (would actually joke around with other interns on how it was a pyramid scheme). Due to the job market my chances of finding another position was low and I came back to my job full time. Since then, there‚Äôs been so many org restructuring and lack of support for the early career program I was in for the rotational program. For context, I‚Äôm a black woman and it‚Äôs four other black women on the team and we‚Äôve all been in the same intern cohort together and share the same experiences. There‚Äôs been multiple people hired after me with less experience doing the same role as me, but making 10k more than us. When my rotation ended a couple of months ago I was denied a promotion even though my contract stated I‚Äôd be promoted after the 14 months. I had to fight and pitch why I was deserving of a salary increase and was offered 7% salary increase which I‚Äôm grateful for, but feel so saddened that after 2 years at a company, giving my hard work efforts, and being tokenized for a ‚Äúprogram that served underrepresented minorities‚Äù 4k was added to my salary but still being underpaid compared to my peers with less experience. A job posting was posted with my same role and city offering a range of 90-115k while I make 70k in a high cost city. I brought this up for negotiation and was told I can‚Äôt negotiate. I hate what I do, but I need my bills paid. I‚Äôve been connecting with multiple people on LinkedIn and events, but it‚Äôs so frustrating never landing an opportunity. The pros of my job is I get unlimited pto and prior to being promoted I really wasn‚Äôt doing anything. Now I‚Äôm expected to assume more responsibilities without compensation and I just want to quit. I have considered putting in my two weeks in April and just figuring life out somehow by either working at a coffee shop or a fast food restaurant while I am on the job hunt for something better. Idk I just feel drained and not like myself at work and it‚Äôs unfortunate because I have 0 savings but for some reason I sometimes think if it‚Äôs worth continuing at a place where I constantly am disappointed and spend most of my time adjusting to changes leadership does rather than gaining skills.

1j32jh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CelebritySlims/comments/1j32jh9/mushroom_coffee_weight_loss_miracle_or_bs_the/,Mushroom Coffee: Weight Loss Miracle or BS?! [The Shocking Truth],"The Buzz About Mushroom Coffee: What is it?
-------------------------------------------

Did you know many people still think mushrooms are just for pizza? I was also like that before. But now, people mix them in coffee! This is called mushroom coffee. It is not like coffee with mushroom pieces. They use mushroom powder. Common types are Chaga, Lion's Mane, Reishi, and Cordyceps. Normal coffee wakes you up fast. Mushroom coffee is different. It gives energy slower and smoother. I want to tell you about mushroom coffee. I hope I can explain it clearly so we can learn together.

Can Mushroom Coffee Actually Help With Weight Loss?
---------------------------------------------------

People ask if mushroom coffee makes you lose weight. The quick answer? Not really as magic. Do not think only by drinking it will you become thin. But some things in mushroom coffee *might* help. The fiber content from mushroom coffee is not high but might contribute to fullness. Some studies show special mushrooms might help with metabolism, but more studies are needed. I will help understand what the research says. I will help manage expectations about weight loss and mushroom coffee and explain facts.

How Mushroom Coffee Affects Appetite and Satiety
------------------------------------------------

I used to eat so much. Always hungry. I heard mushroom coffee *may* help control appetite. It gives a feeling of fullness. Some mushrooms have fiber. Fiber helps you feel full for longer. When you are full, you eat less. The fiber content in certain mushroom extracts, not very high but it assists in hunger control. So, perhaps mushroom coffee can reduce snacking. This *might* help with weight loss. But remember, it is not a big change. It is only a small part of a big plan of eating healthy.

Mushroom Coffee and Improved Energy Levels for Workouts
-------------------------------------------------------

I felt lazy always. No energy. People say mushroom coffee can help. It gives you energy, but not like a jolt from normal coffee. The energy is smoother. This can help you work out more. Working out burns calories. Burning calories helps with weight loss. So, in a way, mushroom coffee helps with weight loss *indirectly.* If it gives energy, you move more. Moving more is good. But mushroom coffee is not a replacement for the workout and healthy lifestyle to achieve your weight goals.

Debunking Weight Loss Claims: What the Science Says About Mushroom Coffee
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many companies say mushroom coffee is good for weight loss. But what does science say? Honestly, not too much. Some small studies exist. These suggest certain mushrooms *might* help. But these studies are not just on mushroom coffee itself. The studies have limitations and need to be carefully analyzed. We need more research. Big, well-done studies that look *specifically* at mushroom coffee. It is important to not believe every claim we see until proper research has been completed.

Potential Side Effects and Considerations of Mushroom Coffee
------------------------------------------------------------

Like with any new food, be cautious about trying mushroom coffee. Some people experience stomach problems. Gas, bloating, or discomfort sometimes occur. It depends on person and the brand. Start with little amount. See how your body reacts. Also, some people could be allergic. If you have allergies, be extra careful. I can help you with information that you are looking for and tips to minimize side effects.

Choosing the Right Mushroom Coffee for Your Needs
-------------------------------------------------

There are so many brands that sell mushroom coffee today. How can you choose? Look at what kind of mushrooms are used. Chaga? Lion's Mane? Reishi? Some are better for energy, others for calming. Check how they extract the mushroom benefits too. See if any sugars or artificial things are added. Read ingredient list carefully. For instance, if the label shows ""Mushroom Extract (Fruiting Body),"" that could be better than ""Mycelium on Grain."" Mycelium on Grain does not have much fruiting body in it.

Incorporating Mushroom Coffee Into a Healthy Lifestyle
------------------------------------------------------

Mushroom coffee is not a magic drink. For weight loss, a healthy lifestyle is the main thing. I want you to eat good food, and exercise. Mushroom coffee can be a small part of that. Maybe drink it instead of normal coffee sometimes. I will suggest integrate mushroom coffee into a healthy lifestyle. Remember, it is not replace. It is just another thing to *help* you to lead a healthier life.

Conclusion
----------

So, does mushroom coffee help with weight loss? Maybe a little. It can give you energy. It *might* help with appetite. But do not expect big changes from only mushroom coffee. It must be part of a bigger plan. Eat healthy food. Do exercise. Talk to a doctor or dietitian before changing your diet. You can try mushroom coffee and see if it works for you. Tell me what you think in the comments.

3 weeks post quad therapy: I continued to have Whole Foods, some sweets and cheese. Took probiotics, multivitamin, digestive and digestive enzymes. Felt extremely bloated post therapy. Bowels regulated, and still satisfying. :D 

I‚Äôve added my scheduled times. My work schedule is 6:30am-3pm so it was easy for me to take the recommended dosage. I missed pills some days, and I still had quite a few left of each, but I stuck with the 14-days instead of extending the quad therapy to finish them. 

Honestly didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd test negative because besides more satisfying bowels, I didn‚Äôt notice much of a difference!

I‚Äôd like to add that I also have SIBO which may be why I don‚Äôt feel much relief.

Best of luck to your healing!
