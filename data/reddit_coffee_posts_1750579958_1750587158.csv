My entire life, all the way back to childhood, waking up in the morning has been absolutely awful. In middle school I was a nightmare every morning. I'm 32 now and I'm medicated (lamictal, fluoxentine, birth control for PMDD) and these have helped me so much but I still struggle every morning no matter what the day ahead looks like. 

The transition from sleep to awake takes me so long, coffee or no, I sleep through alarms, I just don't want to move. I got away with my tardiness problems in school with good grades but ever since I started working at 15, I have chronic tardiness issues and it's cost me so many jobs through the years. The consequences have never seemed to matter enough to change the trend.

I don't want to wake up everyday for the rest of my life just hating it. I have tried every common trick. I know it's something with my brain. Any help or ideas?",1,1750586891.0,bipolar,1,1.0,False

1lhkezl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lhkezl,Whinnyapolis Delegate is Canadian?,"I just finished watching Season 5 Episode 10: Princess Spike, and one side character got me thinking, the Whinnyapolis Delegate's accent sounded a little bit Canadian to me. Though when I searched her up according to the MLP Gameloft Wiki she's actually a reference to Marge Gunderson from the 1996 film Fargo.  
  
I watched Fargo ages ago but I didn't remember her voice so I watched a short clip and yeah this character is most likely only a reference to Marge, but I was nearly convinced she was also a reference to the typical Canadian stereotype because the accent sounds rather similar. 

Not only that but the Delegate's Cutie mark is also a steaming cup of (probably) coffee in a suspiciously red cup, why suspicious you ask? Well as you may know we Canadians love our Timmies, and everyone who's ever bought from them knows the Coffee comes in easily recognizable *red* coffee cups.

Between the Accent (which I admit is very reflective of the character she's based on and shouldn't really be taken as supporting evidence) and the cutiemark reflective of a commonly stereotyped Canadian symbol, I think that's decent enough ground to say she might also be a subtle nod to The True North strong and free.

Anyways just my thoughts, wondering if anyone else can see what I'm talking about or if I'm spouting nonsense. Any further input would be great to hear!",1,1750586717.0,mylittlepony,0,1.0,False
1lhkdy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/KratomVibes/comments/1lhkdy0/what_is_kratom_the_southeast_asian_plant_thats/,What Is Kratom? The Southeast Asian Plant That's Got Everyone Talking,"Ever heard of kratom but not sure what all the fuss is about? You're not alone. This tropical tree from Southeast Asia has been making waves worldwide, and there's a lot to unpack.

# The Basics: What Actually Is Kratom?

Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a tree native to Southeast Asia, where locals have been using its leaves for centuries. Think of it as nature's energy drink meets pain reliever – but with way more complexity.

The leaves contain compounds that interact with your brain's opioid receptors, which sounds scary but here's the kicker: the effects completely depend on how much you take.

# The Dose Makes All the Difference

Here's where kratom gets interesting:

**Small doses:** Users report feeling more energetic, social, and alert. Like coffee's cooler, more focused cousin.

**Larger doses:** The effects flip completely – you're looking at sedation, pain relief, and a general sense of calm.

It's literally like two different substances depending on how much you use.

# Why Do People Use It?

The reasons are all over the map:

Some folks use it for chronic pain management. Others swear by it for social anxiety – apparently it takes the edge off without making you feel foggy.

Then there's the work performance crowd who say it helps them stay focused and motivated throughout long days.

And here's something that might surprise you: it's commonly used to help people get off harder opioids. The irony isn't lost on anyone.

# The Color-Coded World of Kratom Veins

One thing that confuses newcomers is the whole ""vein color"" thing. Kratom comes in three main varieties based on the color of the leaf veins:

**Red Vein:** Generally associated with relaxation and evening use. People describe it as more mellow and calming.

**White Vein:** Often described as the most energizing variety. Think morning motivation and mental clarity.

**Green Vein:** The middle ground – balanced effects that many consider versatile for different times of day.

It's worth noting that the actual leaf processing and drying methods can influence these characteristics just as much as the vein color itself.

# The Reality Check Nobody Talks About

Let's be real – kratom isn't just harmless plant matter. It can create dependence because of how it works on opioid receptors.

The people who use it successfully seem to treat it with respect. They rotate different strains to avoid building tolerance, keep doses low, and don't use it just because they're bored.

# Is It Legal Where You Are?

This is the million-dollar question. Kratom exists in a legal gray area in many places. Some countries have banned it outright, while certain U.S. states have their own restrictions.

Always check your local laws before even thinking about trying it.

# The Bottom Line

Kratom isn't a miracle cure, but it's not the devil either. It's a plant with real effects – both positive and potentially negative.

If you're considering it, do your homework. Start small if it's legal where you are, and be honest about why you want to try it.

1lhk30j,https://i.redd.it/5v49y3w09g8f1.jpeg,The Conscious Effort of Relationships and the Magic of Love,"The Story of Naina and Aarav: A Dance of Love and Effort

Naina and Aarav met at a literature festival. He was a photographer, she was a poet. Their eyes met over coffee and verses, and something magical sparked between them. They talked for hours about dreams, books, and life. It was love — effortless, exciting, and deeply fascinating.

Over time, they moved in together. But as the months passed, life happened. Work stress piled up, chores were forgotten, texts turned into arguments, and silences grew longer. The love they once celebrated now hid behind misunderstandings and unmet expectations.

One evening, after a particularly bitter argument, Naina said something that echoed the quote:

“Aarav, we fell in love by magic… but we forgot that magic doesn’t maintain itself. We have to work on it.”

It hit him. Love had come naturally — yes. But the relationship? That needed consciousness, attention, patience, and maturity. They began rebuilding, this time with awareness.

Understanding the Quote: Two Parts of One Whole

Let’s break down what Omdeep Lariya ji is truly expressing.

🌟 Love is Done By Fascination
Love — in its raw form — is spontaneous. You don’t choose who to fall in love with. It happens. Something about the other person fascinates you. It could be their smile, their intelligence, their vulnerability, or how they make you feel alive.

This is why early stages of love feel so magical. You’re not thinking — you’re feeling. Fascination drives the chemistry, the attraction, the butterflies.

But fascination alone isn’t enough to sustain a relationship.

🧠 Relationships Are Maintained Consciously
This is where the real challenge begins.

When the butterflies fade, when reality sets in, when routines replace romance — that’s when your conscious effort matters most.

A relationship is like a garden. Love is the seed. Fascination plants it. But if you don’t water it daily with attention, honesty, patience, and effort — it will die.

To maintain a healthy, meaningful relationship, you need:

Communication over assumptions

Empathy over ego

Presence over distraction

Forgiveness over resentment

Time over neglect

How to Implement This in Real Life

Here are some practical ways to bring this quote to life:

Celebrate the Fascination, But Don’t Rely on It
The charm that drew you to your partner is important. Keep revisiting those memories. Flirt, laugh, talk about your first dates. But know that fascination needs fuel — it can’t survive on its own.

Create Relationship Rituals
Simple rituals like weekly date nights, morning hugs, or evening walks help you stay connected consciously. They aren’t spontaneous — they’re intentional.

Be Emotionally Present
In an age of constant distractions, being emotionally present is rare. Put your phone down when they talk. Look into their eyes. Listen without waiting to reply.

Solve Conflicts with Compassion
Every relationship has conflict. What matters is how you handle it. Don’t aim to win the argument — aim to understand the pain behind their words.

Check In With Each Other
Ask each other, “How are we doing?” Just like a business needs reviews to grow, so does a relationship.

Grow Together
Encourage each other’s personal growth. Read together. Take a class. Meditate. When both partners grow individually, the relationship blossoms.

Why This Message Matters Today

In a world where breakups are common and commitment feels outdated, Omdeep Lariya ji’s wisdom reminds us of a fundamental truth: Love is the spark, but a relationship is the fire you must keep feeding.

You can fall in love without trying. But you can’t stay in love without trying. And that’s the beautiful paradox.

Fascination may bring two people together, but only conscious effort keeps them together.

Conclusion


The next time you feel love drifting away, remember: it’s not the love that’s gone — it’s the consciousness that faded. Bring it back. Be present. Be patient. Be deliberate. That’s how you turn fascination into a forever.

My delonghi is less than 9 months old, mid way through making a coffee the milk stopped dispensing. After messing around for a while I put the water spout in and I was getting no hot water, it was just diverting into the drip tray. 

I called delonghi support or atleast i tried *not open on a Saturday * 

Being an engineer I decided to have a look myself thinking it would be a blocked hose, i followed the flow of hot water that stopped when it got to a valve block, i removed all the pipes nothing was blocked but nothing was getting through the solenoid. I checked the coil and had 230v on one side and basically nothing on the other side. After removing the coil I measured the continuity and it was an open circuit the coil had clearly burnt out, 

The part is about £50 but is still under warranty. I have decided I'm going to send it off. But I was debating buying the part and fitting it as it would be much quicker process ",1,1750583830.0,DeLonghi,0,1.0,False

She wasn’t very nice about it over the phone and then properly broke up with me in person.
I decided not to speak to her after this. 6 months went by and I was devastated.
For some reason she got a job near my house and we bumped into each other. It was awkward but I tried to move past it. But then I bumped into her again.
She seemed like she wanted to see me and talk. She texted me on her birthday which was a little strange so I wished her a happy birthday and she seemed touched that I remembered.
We ended up meeting up a few times for coffee and she seemed like she was considering things.
It got awkward when I asked her for a drink. She seemed to get nervous or conflicted about it.
I decided to step back again cause I felt like I was bothering her. It was like heartbreak all over again. I beat myself up for not being brave enough to tell her how I felt. 
A few months went by and I was advised to tell her how I felt. I was so scared. I prolonged it and the silence continued.
I was at my brothers wedding and I decided that day that when the wedding was over I would message her.
A couple of days after the wedding was my birthday. I had zero expectations she would message me. I didn’t even think she knew when it was. But she did first thing in the morning.
The joy and excitement I felt was unfathomable. I waited because I didn’t want to seem keen.
We then started chatting for a few days and it felt different this time like she genuinely wanted to talk and see me.
I felt brave so I asked her if she wanted to meet up for a walk.
She didn’t answer for like 3 days then sent me a text saying 
“I’d love to you see you again but I’ve just gotten into a relationship, hope you’re doing good though.”
I was absolutely devastated I had just had very bad news that my family dog had to be put down. So this on top of this was probably the most traumatic week or two of my life.
I was acting very irrational. I sent her a texting telling her how I felt it took everything out of me. I told her that I still had feeling and she was so special to me and I valued our relationship.
She sent a text back that I never answered because I was hurting so much. It basically saying that she valued our relationship too but was only interested in friendship.
It broke me and that summer i suffered so much. Having horrible dreams of her and my subconscious telling me she was happy and laughing at me
A few months before I had started smoking weed as it stopped me from having dream’s altogether. 
2 years since we last spoke and I am with someone else who I love but when I don’t smoke I dream of my ex. My ex as far as I’m concerned doesn’t even think about me.
I don’t wanna talk too much about my current partner but she is exactly what I should want and need
Yet I still dream of someone else and I feel so guilty when I wake up.
Why am I still thinking of this person? 
I feel like I’ve processed everything but it comes up every so often and fucks up my life. Sometimes I still want her and it makes me hate myself
Any advice would be appreciated

But this morning? I witnessed what I can only describe as spiritual chaos.

We’re potty training. It’s going... okay-ish. Today, after she did the deed, she stood up, looked into the toilet bowl like it was the Eye of Sauron, and whispered:

“I’m sorry poop. I’m so, so sorry I had to let you go. I’ll miss you.”

She flushed like she was holding a funeral.

Then she curtsied. CURTSIED.

I have never been more confused, proud, and terrified at the same time.

So naturally I texted her dad (we co-parent) and he responded:

“Well. At least she’s polite?”

What dimension of parenting is this and how do I fast-forward to the part where she just poops and moves on like a normal mammal??

Also does this count as emotional maturity? Or early signs of a cult leader?

My parents used to have a cockatiel but he died 2 weeks ago when a stray cat entered into our house.

I have to mention that we've had ours for about 6 years, my mom literally found him sleeping in the garden while she was drinking her coffee, caught him in hand, and we've kept him, because nobody in the neighbourhood would say he's theirs.

I don't know how other cockatiles behave, but ours was pretty solitary and tame. He'd spent most of the time in front of the mirror, sing and strut to it. His cage always had the top removed, because every time he wanted to fly, he would only do a couple of laps around the living room and returned to it. The only thing he didn't like was being touched. We couldn't really pet him or give him scritches, and if you were to hold him in hand, he'd struggle the entire time.

I want to start fresh with a 2 month old birb, but I don't want to neglect the baby because I work from 9-5.

Some of us had been wondering how she always has the latest gadgets and buys expensive stuff for her husband, especially since she only earns under ₱20k a month, and her husband is unemployed.

But the real shock came when we grabbed coffee before heading home. As a PWD, I handed my ID for a discount, only to find out she and her husband also had PWD IDs. Turns out, almost everyone working at the municipal office gets issued a PWD ID, including their family members, just to get discounts on food, groceries, and more.

Then, during the wedding prep, I overheard her and her husband calculating their gas expenses for the trip (4 hours away). What blew my mind was that they said they'd reimburse it through the municipality, even though it wasn’t work-related at all. I later learned that pretty much all their travel expenses get reimbursed using public funds, our taxes.

You know what’s even more ironic? She’s hated me since high school because I’ve always been very vocal about how much I hate corruption here in the Philippines. I regularly speak out on social media about political and moral issues, and yeah, she resents me for it because we’re not aligned politically or ethically. Now I see why.

No wonder our town isn't progressing and is getting worse over time. With this kind of blatant misuse of government resources, I can't imagine ever working in that environment without losing my soul.

**Anong kwentong corruption sa municipality niyo ang alam niyo?** I'm curious if this kind of thing is happening everywhere or if it's just our town where everyone who works at the municipality automatically gets a PWD ID, or where all your gas expenses can be reimbursed.",3,1750582800.0,OffMyChestPH,5,1.0,False

gor / gorokhovsky is a trump sycophant who entered the trump inner circle after starting his political climb working for rand paul.  gor / gorokhovsky started a publishing firm with trump JR (they concentrate on publishing right wing info -- came out with a coffee table picture book of trump!!)

evidently gor / gorokhovsky fought against people having to turn in SF-86 forms and never turned one in yet trump trusts him implicitly. 

who knows, but sure seems hypocritical for this guy to be allowed to hide his country of origin after a) trump's past obama birth certificate bullshit and b) brown people getting yanked off streets, out of immigration courts, out of vehicles and disappeared...

He had never had a relationship before. I naturally understand communication can dwindle when people get into new relationships. I have left him to be in his love bubble but reached out periodically throughout the year to keep checking in etc. whenever I have asked him to meet up for a catch up, he always suggested we bring our partners, and then the plans just haven't happened. I recently asked if I had upset him or something as he has made no effort to keep the friendship going and then he suggested meeting up but again bringing partners. I thought as I havent seen him for maybe 10 months now, we could hang out just the two of us but he has stated we aren't allowed to meet up 1-2-1 At all, for coffee, a walk, a drink - nothing, and can only catch up with our partners present or in a group setting.

I can't help feeling really hurt by this as I thought we had a genuine friendship. I've confided in him with some private stuff that I hadn't told anyone else before, trust him to my core! And really thought he was the same. 

When I got into my own relationship 4 years ago, I made a point of seeing him once a week every week to normalise it for my partner, who could very much see we were just friends and took no issue with it. But I feel hurt that he didn't do the same, he just dropped me for his new girlfriend and now has said we can only meet up in a group setting. I understand she doesn't know me, so I don't actually blame her at all because naturally she would be suspicious, but I'm mad at him for not normalising our friendship from the start. I feel like I should have maybe been pushier to keep it going instead of backing off to give him time and space? Which has now left us in this weird space where we can't be true friends. I just feel like a friendship with conditions is no friendship at all. I'm more than happy to spend time getting to know her and don't take issue with meeting up with our partners, but I very much know had I said the same thing 4 years ago when he was single and I just got into a relationship, he would have been really opinionated about it and given me so much stick! He knows he would too and has been abit cagey with his words. I'm just hurt to be honest as I fully imagined this friend being in my life until we were old and grey!

We became friends when i saved him from alcohol poisoning at a party two years ago and ever sense we have been inseparable (i’ll call him R). We have two friend groups that we are both a part of and i and we have spent the vast majority of the past two years together minus the time this year where he was away at college. Just as a note we are both gay so this is the most platonic friendship and a big part of why i felt so safe in this friendship is cause i knew he didn’t secretly have an agenda cause he didn’t like women. 

Anyways when he left for college we joked a lot about me going to the state he is in for school sense i wasn’t planning on going to school after graduation. After a while the jokes became plans and we ended up signing a lease together for an apartment in that state which starts mid august. He was the only person i could see myself living with sense i’ve lived at his house before due to some family issues on my end and we did really well as roommates. 

Now to get to the more recent part of the story last month he came home from college and i had a month of school left till i graduate (i do online school). He saw that i was struggling sense i was working three jobs as well as trying to graduate so he offered to do some of my school to take some weight off my shoulders sense he was already doing some work for one of our other good friends who i’ll call S. I agreed and told him i’d buy him stuff as my way of saying thank you for the help. 

I had four classes left so we split them in half and i did all of one of mine and most of the other one before he asked me for my computer so he could work on the other classes. I gave it to him and he has been periodically updating me on what he has been finishing. A week ago he told me that he had fully finished one of the classes and had two assignments left in the other one so i was feeling good. 

At this point in time i was living with one of our other friends due to a strange housing situation and that friends family was moving so i was going to move in with R’s family until our move cross country to our apartment in august. I had packed up all my stuff from our friends house and called him letting him know i would probably be getting to his house around 4-6pm and he told me he was just finishing up the last couple of assignment and he would be at the house so i could bring my stuff and use my laptop to turn in the rest of the class i was doing sense it was the day before the deadline for me to get everything in. 

That whole conversation was at 2pm and when 6pm came around i called him to let him know i was gonna be on my way. He didn’t answer but i wasn’t worried sense he’s notoriously not great at answering the phone. I had dinner with my friends family not thinking much of it and then our friends S calls me to ask if i had heard from R. I told her i hadn’t talked to him sense 2 but i was planning on heading over soon so i would check on him and let her know. She was quite worried sense she noticed he had turned his life 360 location off at 2:15 that day and he had never done that before. 

I drive over to his place with all my stuff and see that his car isn’t in his driveway but his sister C (f22) had pulled into the driveway so i went up and asked her if she knew where R was. She had told me last time she talked to him way before she had left the house at 2 and he had said he was going to go get groceries sense his parents were out of town for the week and they were running low on food. We get into the house and see that he is not there and neither are the groceries which is strange sense it’s 8pm at this point and it’s been a hot day so groceries would have gone bad in his car all day. 

She tries checking his location and it was off on their family life 360 too so i call S to update her on what’s happening and she comes over to the house. Now me S and C are trying to figure out where he could be as we are calling and texting him to no avail. Eventually his location turns back on at 8:45 and we see that he’s downtown about ten minutes from the house and heading towards us. So we sit there and wait for him to get to the house and to our surprise he passes the turn to his neighborhood and instead drives up to his old middle school. 

Now it’s 9pm on a Tuesday so we have no idea what he’s doing in a middle school parking lot but then he responds to his sisters message and says “i’m fine, tell (me) and S to go home”. Now we are all baffled cause this is really weird behavior for him so we all decided to go get in C’s car and drive to the middle school to see what’s going on, right as we are approaching the school he drives away and races us back to the house before locking himself in his room. 
 
We get to the house and knock on his door and get no response, his sister has to threaten to call the cops for a wellness check if he doesn’t open the door so he opens it a crack and basically says the only way he’ll leave the door unlocked is if we will all go away and leave him alone. C asks him about me and S’s laptops to see if he would give them back but that just makes him shut down further and he basically says he doesn’t know where they are and then shuts the door. 

Me and S are really confused and concerned for him so we decide to trace back to all the places we know he went and see if we can find any clues that will lead us to the truth about what had happened that night, we were out until almost 2am looking for clues and discussing what could have possibly happened. Sold our laptops for drugs? Got assaulted by some grinder dude? Got overwhelmed and threw our laptops into the lake? We thought of every possibility and still came out with more questions than answers so we decided to just go to bed. I head back to his place and sleep downstairs on the couch, the next morning i wake up full of hope that he’ll be feeling better today and will tell us what happened yesterday. 

Unfortunately all i see is the back of his head while he scurry’s back to his room with a mug of coffee. C is in the kitchen so i ask her if she got anything out of him this morning and she said that when she asked him how he was he had smiled and gave her a thumbs up but didn’t actually say anything before scurrying back to his room. I’m now super worried but it’s also the last day that i can turn anything in for school so i decide to knock on his door and ask him for my laptop back myself. 

I knock and basically spend 20 minutes telling him how i love him and i’m sorry he’s not doing well and i understand he wants some space but i do really need my laptop sense it’s now noon so all of my work is due in 12 hours. He eventually slips me a note telling me to check my phone so i go downstairs to grab my phone and see that he has texted me multiple times pretty aggressively telling me to get away from the door and he would put my computer out there. I think this is weird but need my computer back so i comply and walk to the dining room which is fully out of sight of his bedroom and text him that i was in the dining room. He texted me to go downstairs instead so i do and he gives my laptop back. 

I call S to update her on the events of the morning and then i go back downstairs to work on my last couple projects. When i open my laptop to my school website i see that n o t h i n g has been done. I start freaking out and text him asking what happened and why non of it was done even though he told me it was finished and he basically told me it was my fault for forcing him to do my work. 

I tell him i wish he would have communicated with me that he didn’t want to do it because i would have done it if i knew and had my laptop and he slides me aderall under his door and basically says to stop overreacting and it would be fine. It was indeed not going to be fine because i had a quarters worth of work to do on 2.5 classes and there was no way i could finish all that on time even with the aderall. I start having a full fledged panic attack and call some friends and we basically spend 12 hours doing all of my work and actually managed to do it in time so i did graduate (yay). 

Whilst driving to my friends house i inform S that R had not done any of the work for my classes and he had actully blamed it on S and said that he was too busy doing her work to get mine done. S and R have a talk that same day where he tells her that he actually hadn’t done any of her work either and because of that she failed both of her classes, and sense she’s in college she still had to pay for those classes as well as them tanking her gpa. He proceeds to tell her that it’s all my fault that he hadn’t gotten her work done and it’s cause i forced him to do mine so he didn’t have time for hers. 

That night i go over to my other friend L’s house and explain to her parents what happened and they tell me i can stay as long as i need to and that they think that was a manic episode and that i should call his parents and let them know. After thinking about it all night i decide to call his mom and let her know what happened. I am very close with his family sense i have lived there before as well as being invited to the last two Christmas’s and Thanksgivings so i felt like i owed his mom the truth even if it meant he would be mad at me i would rather him be mad at me and get the help he needs then keep spiraling. 

His mom told me that she was very sorry but she also wasn’t surprised sense this is pretty typical behavior of him. He’s very ambitious so he will over commit to things and then his task avoidance will kick in so he will avoid starting the task he committed to and lie to buy himself more time, and when it finally gets to the point he realizes he doesn’t have any time left he shuts down and then blames everyone else sense he can’t face the truth that he let people down. 

I was shocked to hear this sense this didn’t at all sound the R that i knew and it made me question weather or not i even really knew him at all. I called S and updated her on everything today and then she told me a whole bunch of information thats making me further question our friendship. She told me that he was lying about a whole bunch of stuff like guys he had been with and saying he had done drugs that he hadn’t and a bunch of other stuff as well as the fact that he lied to S saying that i had said something about her that i had never said. 

I also learned that he had been taking shit about me to S and our other friends and saying that i trama dumped too much and that i aced like my problems were more important then his and that after losing my ex best friend E that i have never been the same. It breaks my heart to know this is what he thought of me when he was the only person in the world who i truly believe would never talk shit behind my back, the one thing i have ever asked of him in our friendship is to be honest and upfront with me and he hadn’t done that. 

S and our other friends are planning on cutting him off after everything that’s happened but i don’t know what i want to do. He’s my best friend and i love him and we have a whole life planned out and we already have a lease signed and a 20 hour road trip there planned. I don’t know if i can be friends with him again knowing how he truly feels about me and that he’s been lying to me our entire friendship. I have been reevaluating every conversation we have ever had and wondering if any of it was true, why would he lie to me?

 I can’t afford to break my lease at our apartment so the move is set in stone but i don’t know how i’m going to live with him after all of this. Part of me is hoping he’ll break his part of the lease so i get another roommate and get to start fresh but i’m gonna be an hour away from my closest friend who lives a couple cities over at a different college in the state so i’m gonna be all alone in a place where i know no one. I don’t know what to do here, i know it’s my fault and i shouldn’t have been so trusting and i shouldn’t have moved cross country for someone but he’s my best friend and i truly trusted and loved him. Any advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated, sorry for how long this was. ",4,1750582068.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

BUT... I THINK I FOUND THE IMPOSSIBLE!! 

That was my concern heading into That Place in Mascot, but how wrong I was!! 

Ordered a chilli scrambled eggs, and DAMN! They hit! A house sambal, tornado eggs with great mushrooms and a piece of toast. They were brilliant! 

We also ordered the Breakfast Burger, which was very decent and the kid pancakes, which were also really solid! 

The playground was a fairly standard playground, but plenty of swings, a slide and a heap of bikes and other ride on things that can amuse the kids. 

A solid coffee as well and DAMN. Well worth checking out. I'll be back!

1lhja69,https://i.redd.it/dmfpt5axyf8f1.jpeg,"Locked in a great recipe for complex, light roasted coffees (UK focused!)","
Just wanted to share that I've landed on a really good recipe profile, especially for the sorts of complex, light roasted coffees we often get from specialty roasters here in the UK. I'm using a Fellow Aiden and a Fellow Ode Gen 2 Grinder.

I've sometimes found that some of the widely shared Fellow recipes don't always translate perfectly to the types of beans speciality roasters here tend to offer. I assume that speciality roasts might be a bit more developed in the US, but here, many of our roasters go pretty light!

I actually started with the Special Guests (a UK coffee shop and subscription business) Fellow Drop recipe and tweaked it a little. I've used it to brew a couple of around 500ml brews, and it has been tasting consistently great. I have not brewed anything with the single/conical basket so can’t speak to that.

I was really keen to switch up my normal recipe, especially as I'm currently enjoying an exciting anaerobic natural - Rwandan coffee from Horsham Coffee Roasters.

For my grind, I'm using a Fellow Ode Gen 2 grinder with the stock Gen 2 burrs, and I've been grinding between 7-8.

Here's my full profile for those who want to give it a go:
Bright Brews - For Light Roast & Sweet Coffees https://brew.link/p/MHaT

If anyone tries it, please let me know what you think!

Also, just a final thought: I know Scott Rao's suggestion is often about a bed depth of around 3cm. On a 500ml pot of coffee, my bed depth is around 1.5cm. I've attached photos of the bed (see comments, I'll add them there!), and it doesn't look like there are any issues with channeling, but does anyone have any thoughts or advice on this difference in bed depth?

Cheers!

1lhj8h8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhj8h8/20m_im_still_obsessed_with_her/,(20m) I’m still obsessed with her,"(I’m Italian, and this is my first time ever posting, so apologies if I make any grammatical mistakes.)

In the summer of 2023, I met a girl during a group hangout with some friends — let’s call her Diana. At first, I thought she was annoying. But over the next few months, I saw her again a couple of times at parties. During those events, we talked, joked, and teased each other nonstop, and I started to notice a really strong chemistry between us. Still, at the time, I was hopelessly into someone else — the girl who would soon become my first girlfriend — so I completely ignored any of Diana’s approaches, often acting cold (I later found out she had a crush on me back then).

Fast forward to March 2024: the day after getting dumped by my girlfriend, Diana showed up at one of my volleyball matches (she was dragged there by some friends). That day I was emotionally wrecked and didn’t feel like talking to anyone, so I pretended not to notice her. Later that evening, she texted me first — and honestly, partly because I was amused by how persistent she was, I decided to go along with it. We ended up texting every day and night.

In May, she drove two hours just to come watch me play in a tournament. She cheered for me all day while wearing my hoodie (which she had “stolen” while I wasn’t paying attention). A few weeks later, we had our first one-on-one date: we went to the movies. It went really well — halfway through the movie, she lay down on me and rested her head on my chest. I put my arm around her, and we stayed like that until the end of the film.

When it was time to say goodbye, she hugged me and looked into my eyes for a moment, but I didn’t have the courage to kiss her. In the following weeks, we kept texting, but we couldn’t manage to meet up again — sometimes it was my fault, sometimes hers. Eventually, in July, we went our separate ways (I should mention that there was a chance I might be moving away for good that summer — which didn’t happen in the end).

In August, missing her, I tried to break the silence with a silly joke, but she responded coldly. I took that as a sign to step back and focus on myself. And it was working… until October, when she suddenly liked one of my Instagram stories. I ignored it, but she started creeping back into my mind. A few weeks later, out of nowhere, she messaged me and reopened the conversation. At first, I acted cold — I was scared of getting hurt again — but after a few days, I opened up a bit, and she quickly asked me to grab a coffee.

It went terribly: she arrived an hour late (though she stayed on the phone with me the whole time while coming), and I spilled our coffees, though she actually laughed it off. Still, I realized during that outing that even though our conversation still flowed, there was now a bit of a wall between us. Eventually, the texts faded again.

About a week later, we both had volleyball games in the same gym. We agreed that whoever finished first would go watch the other play. I finished first and went to watch her match. But when I approached her afterward, a male friend of hers came over, and she introduced us. I didn’t know at the time that they were just friends, so I convinced myself she had moved on and only saw me as a friend now. That night, we chatted a bit — it still felt easy and playful — but I didn’t pick the conversation back up afterward. And neither did she.

About a month later, we crossed paths at a professional match, but we just waved from a distance (we even pretended not to see each other at first).
At Christmas, I found the courage to wish her happy holidays, but she replied coldly again, so I decided to leave her alone for good.

Then in April 2025, we crossed paths again at another match. This time, I waved at her best friend, who was sitting next to her, and Diana turned her back and ignored me completely. I was hurt, so when I passed by her later, I ignored her too — and decided to move on for real.

But in mid-May, out of the blue, she liked a photo I posted with my mom (there’s a running inside joke about my mom between us — long story). A few days later, since it was her birthday, I decided to send her a message, but kept it short and cold. She replied with a thank-you… and a heart emoji (which she doesn’t usually do when she’s being cold).

Two weeks later, I got a follow request from her best friend on Instagram.

Now it’s June 20th. I’ve liked a couple of her “Close Friends” Instagram stories — nothing personal, just neutral content (she never removed me from Close Friends, by the way). But honestly, I don’t think I have the courage to message her.

Part of me wants to move on, but the awareness that nothing ever really happened between us — despite the amazing chemistry (which she also pointed out once) — keeps pulling my thoughts back to her. And the fact that we both remained single all this time isn’t helping.

Sorry that this took a while, I have been very busy and it is also very time consuming to research and translate (not native english speaker)

Here are the results:

**My lifestyle is sedentary:** True (65%)   False (35%) (267 votes)

Relevance: The CDC estimates that only [25%](https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/php/data/inactivity-maps.html#:~:text=Differences%20in%20the%20prevalence%20of,physical%20inactivity%20prevalence%20of%2025.3%25) of America's population is sedentary. We are almost 3x that in the SIBO community, according to this poll. Why is this relevant, in my opinion? Because being sedentary is strongly linked with constipation and bowel control in general (as seen in many [studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3748072/), I will link [2](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/common-causes-of-constipation) but there are many). If being sedentary is causing you to become constipated, constipation itself can cause SIBO. I will elaborate further on in my post. 

**I have some form of pelvic tilt:** Sway Back (7%) Anterior (35%) Thoracic (9%)  Forward Head (23%) Good Posture (24%) (214 votes)

Relevance: Our posture determines how much [pressure](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1773697/) is put on our colon, as well as [how our muscles that assist in moving stool operate,](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/3-surprising-risks-of-poor-posture) and can indirectly make your constipation/diarrhea worse as a result. Anterior pelvic tilt specifically, which was the most common posture amongst our survey takers, is a main factor in [pelvic floor dysfunction,](https://www.healthline.com/health/constipation/pelvic-floor-therapy-for-constipation#constipation-symptoms) which impacts people's ability to properly have bowel movements and will lead to bloating and stool buildups which **can then** **result in** SIBO, as your body cannot properly remove waste from the large colon (resulting in stool flowing up into your small bowel, bringing all of the bacteria with it).

**I believe food poisoning caused my SIBO:** True (36%) False (63%) (219 votes)

Relevance: I was interested in seeing why people thought they had SIBO. It is entirely plausible that food poisoning can give you SIBO, I was just interested to see what proportion of the community thought this was their root cause. It appears that the majority do not believe food poisoning is their root cause. 

**I believe antibiotics caused my SIBO:** True (49%) False (51%) (229 votes)

Relevance: My SIBO was in part caused by antibiotic overuse so I was interested to see if this was also the case for the majority of the community. I will elaborate on how I know antibiotics can result in SIBO. 

When you take antibiotics, it disrupts the balance of natural gut flora in the large intestine. This disruption causes dysbiosis (the overgrowth of a few types of species of bacteria) which means their normal functions are now multiplied, whereas the bacteria that are crowded out are now minimized. This can result in stools that are more difficult to pass, and this slow motility can result in waste building up in the large colon, which over time will then spill into your small bowel, where you are supposed to be absorbing food. These bacteria are still ""healthy"" and are not to be killed, but are to be balanced. Part of the treatment will require that you restore the minimized bacteria through probiotics or a stool transplant. 

**Probiotics made my SIBO:** Better (13%) Worse (20%) Sometimes better, sometimes worse (50%) Never taken probiotics (8%) Probiotics gave me SIBO (6%) (196 votes)

Relevance: Most people with SIBO have responded in some way to probiotics, the majority having both positive and negative experiences with them. This is because testing probiotics is somewhatof a guessing game, where you don't really know which bacteria you're missing and which are already overgrown. In my case, I KNEW I had way too much bacteria that came from yogurt/kimchi/kefir because they only made my SIBO way worse (I had very bad constipation and brainfog) However, when I tried bifidobacterium strains (which I only started using because in my research, that is the main bacteria found in new-born babies guts, and their stool is always super runny) my symptoms drastically improved, before becoming bad/different kind of bad days later. 

The trick to making this work is decreasing the time it takes for the probiotics to get to your large colon, where they need to be in order to work. If they sit in the small intestine, they are certain to only make things bad (albeit, sometimes better if you're really suffering from a bad case of dysbiosis).

So, in order to do this, you can take digestive aids, prokenetics (fresh ginger root, coffee) while taking your probiotics. You would also need to eat low fodmap and soft, easy to digest foods such as potatoes, soft cheeses, eggs, chicken, fish, etc. Now, the key would also be to move a lot during the day to assist these things in moving out of your small bowel and into the large.

The number one thing that made the difference between these standard treatments working and not working was how much I was moving every day. Stretching. Sprinting. Drinking hot water to lubricate my digestive system. These things MATTER. Imagine your small intestine is like a cement truck, the moment that food stops sliding along its going to begin to ferment (an oversimplification but hopefully you understand the metaphor)

**I play sports that involve running, skating, or swimming 2x per week:** True (23%) False (77%) (211 votes)

Relevance: Sports push you in ways walking or running at your own pace doesn't. I truly didn't get better, even trying all of my treatment methods, until I started playing soccer twice a week. I could feel the soreness in my abdominals (your abdominal muscles are extremely important in moving waste along the digestive tract) and my legs became easier and easier to stretch, taking a lot of pressure off of my hips and my back.

I strongly believe that, although exercise will not outright cure SIBO, it is what makes the difference when it comes to making treatments work. Why is it that some people are instantly cured with antibiotics, probiotics, or enzymes? What separates them from those who suffer endless SIBO no matter what they try? I truly believe that it is the misunderstanding of just how important movement, abdominal strength, and posture is for our digestive system.

Now, of course there are other problems that can result in longer lasting and more difficult SIBO, such as intestinal damage, surgeries, and plenty of other things. This post is only meant to try and help people who know they are otherwise healthy but cannot seem to shake their SIBO.

In order for you to truly cure this disease, you must be mindful of ALL of the variables in your life. Every piece of food you consume, every moment of your life, how you sleep, if your bed contributes to bad posture, if your body is tight, if your abs are weak, etc. I have been trying to help endless amounts of people who have private messaged me but it is so difficult to properly show people how to test for these things. You must do your own research and properly LOOK at your own body and life to realize what is contributing to this disease. 

There were some more polls but they were less relevant, if you are interested in them you can check my accounts posts. 

I will be open to questions and may create a more detailed solutions post in the future. I have realized that this disease may require an in person or video demonstration because oftentimes, the words do not properly convey what must be done, and it makes everything immensely difficult when trying to figure out what is wrong over text. 

Best,

1lhixm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhixm2/a_whole_group_of_people_hate_me_f20_for_dating_my/,A whole group of people hate me (F20) for dating my boyfriend (M20),"So back in November, I (F20) met a guy (M23) through Instagram and we hung out for a while as friends. He would invite me over to hangout, go to parties, clubs, etc. Over time I met a bunch of people. I became close with a couple of them and acquaintances with others. 

In December, he hosted a Christmas party and I was introduced to my now boyfriend (M20) to which I barely remember him being there because he had a girlfriend (F21) so I didn’t pay him any mind. I also was introduced to a couple of girls who seemed nice (ranging from 21-24). 

Then in late January, a friend group formed around this group, guys and girls, and they would mostly go out to local bars or shows and sometimes hangout at each other’s apartments and drink. At first, I wasn’t even being invited to these small events, only big parties, even though we had all become friends at the same time. Of course I felt a little left out, but it wasn’t a big deal. 

Eventually, one of the girls (F22), we will call her R, invited me out to the bar with them and I went. We all started hanging out pretty consistently but they all felt much closer to each other than they did to me. 

My boyfriend and the girl he was dating at the time, we will call her A, were apart of this friend group, but he wouldn’t come around every time because he had work and whenever he was around he was just very quiet and kept to himself mostly. 

There were a few instances where I would go to pick her up because she lived close to me, but we were very different and it felt like one of those friendships where you guys are really only friends because of a friend group. I had really only felt close to one of the girls because we had hung out outside of the friend group. 

In February, he broke up with his girlfriend because he felt as if they weren’t compatible (his words). They were together exactly 3 months. Keep this in mind. 

I hope this is all making sense , but to make things even more complicated, R actually had feelings for me and had asked to hangout with me, to which I agreed. The entire hangout felt strictly friendly, even to the point where she was trying to set me up with two of her guy friends. So I shut that down really fast. 

Anyways, the more we hung out, the more my boyfriend and I seemed to get closer. It was all very friendly at first, but he seemed to come out of his shell a lot. During this time, A stopped coming around because the break up wasn’t mutual and she was getting over her feelings for him. So in turn, I never saw her but the other girls would because they had already been close before the friend group was established. 

I moved into a new apartment and the night I moved in a couple of friends came over to celebrate, my boyfriend being one of them. From that night on I had them over every night and not everyone would be able to join every time, but if there was one person who was there like clockwork, it was him. He started coming early, we started texting outside the friend group, he would stay later and fall asleep on my couch. 

The tension between us quickly grew and one night half of the friend group went to the fair and later that night the rest of the friend group joined at my apartment for a small party. I thought everyone would be too drunk to drive home but by the end of the night, everyone had left and it was just my boyfriend left. Nothing happened that night, but the next morning things happened between us. 

We spent the next 2 days together, and we decided that we would tell the friend group. 

To make a very long story short, we went over to R’s apartment to talk about it and the only people there were 3 girls from the friend group (not even his ex girlfriend). They were PISSED to say the least. They called me every name in the book you could possibly think of wh**e , sk*nk, even a combination of the two. Threatened to beat my ass (mind you these girls are about 23-23), threatened me. R was extremely mad, she had thought the feelings she had for me were reciprocated, but the only time she would talk about her feelings with me was when she was drunk and I already struggle with accepting or even knowing my sexuality so I didn’t want to get tangled up in that. At one point, one of the girls had grabbed something off of the coffee table and threw it at me as my boyfriend and I walked out the door. 

They had viewed what we did as “impulse” and kept claiming that we could’ve “fucked any random person”, meanwhile we were trying to explain it was more than that, but they refused to believe it. 

Oh on top of that, these girls were absolutely ruthless to me, but excused my boyfriends actions saying that “they understand why he did it” but that i’m the most fucked up person ever for what I did. WE DID THE SAME THING??? They were acting as if I seduced him into bed with me that night lmfao. 

The ex girlfriend never said anything to me, she did text my boyfriend a paragraph though. Now all those girls are blocked. Some people from the friend group removed me on social media, others didn’t. 

With all this to say, I have a really bad sense of self and this is one of those situations where I really beat myself up. I have a lot of long time best friends so I know I’m not a terrible friend, I didn’t even really consider myself “close” with these people as we had only hung out for about a month and a half. But still, I tend to care about what other people think of me and a lot of those girls know people that I know. 
There was even an instance where we all saw each other out at the same rave in different groups and they were harassing me, yelling at me, calling me names, in a public environment. 

Two of the girls and most of the boys from the friend group still talk to me and interact with me, so sometimes I don’t feel awful about myself. But then there are times where I consider R’s feelings for me or A’s feelings for my boyfriend and I just feel terrible and I cry about it a lot for some reason. 

My boyfriend and I are still together (4 months) and we’re going really strong and he comforts me about it because he knows I beat myself up about it. 

My roommate pointed out last night that ever since I lost that group of friends, I’ve just seemed more down than usual. I guess I never noticed it but now that she says it , maybe she’s right. ",1,1750580508.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
