No magic, just simple steps.

Losing 10 pounds: **not a big deal?** Think again. Your knees say thanks. Each pound lost is 4 pounds less pressure on them. **Neat, huh?** That’s why 10 pounds matters. **Don't believe it?** Try walking around with a 10-pound backpack all day. **Feels heavy?** Now, imagine life without it. **That's** what we’re aiming for.

**Why 10 pounds?** It’s doable. **It's not a dream,** but a goal you can reach. **Small steps,** big results. **There is no rush,** just steady progress. **Healthy ways** matter. **No quick fixes,** just sustainable changes. **Ready?** Let’s go.

# Understanding the Basics of 10-Pound Weight Loss

# What Does a 10-Pound Weight Loss Look Like?

Losing **10 pounds**. Big deal, right? But what does it *really* look like? Well, imagine this: you got a big bag of potatoes. Now, grab about **10 of those**. That's what **10 pounds** feels like. Pretty heavy, huh? Now, imagine that weight gone from your body. Feels good, yeah?

But it's not just about looks. Oh no, it's way more. **10-pound weight loss** can make you feel *lighter*. Like, you might jump out of bed, not all draggy. And your clothes? They'll fit *so* much better. Might even need new ones. *Shh*, don't tell your wallet.

And the *timeline*? Well, healthy **weight loss** ain't quick. It's like a slow cooker, not a microwave. **1-2 pounds a week**, docs say. So, that's like, what? **5-10 weeks**. Yeah, that's a bit. But hey, good things take time, right?

# The Science Behind Weight Loss

Alright, *science* time. **Caloric deficit**. Big words, I know. Just means burn more than you eat. So, how much to cut for **10-pound loss**? Well, a pound is about **3500 calories**. So, **10 pounds** is like, uh, **35000**. Big number, huh? But don't go crazy. Just cut **500 calories** a day. See? Not so bad.

Now, **metabolism**. It's like your body's engine. Vroom vroom. Some got it fast, some slow. It's why some people lose **weight** quick, others not. Just how it is.

And **macronutrients**. Protein, carbs, fats. Like the three musketeers. All important. Balance 'em. Don't go cutting one out. Your body needs all three. Like a happy family.

So, that's it. **10-pound weight loss**. Not quick, not always easy. But hey, you got this. One step at a time. You'll see.

# Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them

# Dealing with Weight Loss Plateaus

You’ve hit a wall? Plateaus suck. First, don’t panic—it’s normal. **Why do they happen?** Your body adjusts. It’s like it’s saving energy because it thinks you’re starving.

Shake things up. Eat a bit more one day and less the next. Confuses your system. **Workouts?** Try lifting heavier or walking faster. If you’ve been running, maybe add squats. Doing the same stuff every day? Boring for you *and* your body.

Drinks count too. Sugar hides in your coffee or juice. Cutting those sneaky calories? Big difference. Keep things moving, and that plateau will get crushed.

# Staying Motivated Throughout Your Weight Loss Journey

The scale? It lies sometimes. Your weight might not budge, but maybe your jeans fit looser. That’s called **non-scale victories (NSVs)**. Celebrate those!

**Progress tracking**? Pictures are gold. Same shirt, same mirror, every two weeks. Changes show even when numbers don’t. Feels good to see, trust me.

Accountability helps. Grab a buddy who keeps you honest. Don’t know anyone? Join a **weight loss community** online. Sharing tips or just complaining together keeps you going. People cheer you on, and it feels amazing.

Small rewards work too. Hit a goal? Buy a cool water bottle or a new gym shirt. Treat yourself—but not with cake, obviously.

# Keep Pushing, One Day at a Time

Every challenge has a hack. Plateaus don’t last if you outsmart them. Motivation? You make it happen, one tiny win at a time. Focus on *how far you’ve come*, not just how far to go. The **10-pound weight loss** is closer than you think.

  
**Wrap-Up: Your 10-Pound Weight Loss Plan**

Losing **10 pounds**? It's about doing small things every day. Swapping fries for veggies, moving your body, drinking more water—that’s the magic. Stick with it, even if results feel slow. Progress takes time, but it’s worth it.

Don’t forget: weight loss works best when it’s **sustainable**. Quick fixes don’t stick. Focus on what you can keep doing long-term, like better habits and realistic goals. Falling off for a day? That’s okay. Start fresh the next.

Want extra help? Make your own plan. **Write it down**—meals, workouts, even reminders to sleep more. Having a plan makes things easier.

And hey, you're not alone. Find others on the same path. Share your wins and struggles. Join a **weight loss community** or just talk with friends who get it. Support feels awesome, and cheering each other on makes the whole thing fun.

Patience pays off. Keep going one step at a time. You’ll look back soon and realize how far you’ve come. **Ready? Start now**. Write your first step down, and let’s go!",1,1732637382.0,u_subashbusiness95,0,1.0,False

I'm trying to heat our sun room, which is an addition on the house, about 150 sq ft, and not very well insulated. At night, we close the sliding door to reduce heating bills. In the morning, during the winter, it's very cold when we open the room up. 

What we got out of the Govee heater was a quick, cheap way to turn off the heat at night when we close down the room, and then automatically begin heating the room again before we wake up. I set it to start heating at 6a so that it would be warm enough to sit and drink coffee in by 6:30a. It worked perfectly well. 

Since the recall, though, I am having an impossible time finding something to replace it with.

I've been tearing through Amazon, Google, even websites of hardware stores for hours now, and I'm wondering if the US recently changed fire safety regulations or something, because the only units I'm seeing that have Wi-Fi/app/schedule controls are wall mounted (which I'm trying to avoid, because I don't want to put weight on the walls). 

Everything else only has an auto-off timer. There are a few exceptions, even one Dreo option, but the reviews are way lower than what I remember seeing this time last year. And many of the negative reviews focus on things like the Wi-Fi disconnecting when shut off manually, or being unable to control heat from the app, or build quality being lower.

I feel like I'm missing something, but I'm stumped.

Am I overthinking this by trying to get a smart heater?

Should I look into safe ways of using a smart plug with a dumb heater instead? I'm kind of put off by this idea since safety measures can be circumvented on accident, like how fans sometimes need to run like ~30 seconds before shutting off to expel remaining heat.

Are there better ways I'm just not thinking of?

At most it feels like I have drank a coffee and does nothing for me other than take my hunger away and make it harder to sleep some nights. 

My psychiatrist had mentioned that we would go up to 40mg if 30mg didn’t work and if that doesn’t work we would try Equasym and if that didn’t work Tyvanse. 

I don’t know if I want to try the 40mg Ritalin LA I just don’t feel it’s the right fit for me? But not sure how to communicate this with my psychiatrist. Any advice is welcome and I understand that finding the right dose and meds will take time. Just don’t want to do another month on Ritalin LA wasting money and time 🤔

Or if you have psychosis along with depression this med might fit better.
Similar to how ssris aren’t compatible with people who have bipolar disorder.

It looks like a medium to medium-light roast level, although I'm fairly new to the coffee universe so take that with a grain of salt. The beans are quite dense: 20g fits *comfortably* in my 18g basket.
* **Dose/yield/time:** I've really run the gauntlet here. 17 in 34 out, 26s, with a relatively average grind: didn't taste particularly sour or bitter. Best way I can describe it is that the shot had no opinion on what it should taste like. I also think the basket was under-filled in this case (tamper hitting the walls). 18 in, 36 out, 31s, slightly finer grind: similar to the previous shot. 19 in, 38 out, fine grind size: this completely failed and was over-extracted. I saw someone on this sub with a Breville machine say they used 20 in, mid-50s out with a much coarser grind when pulling light roasts. So I tried 20 in, 56 out, 43s, much coarser grind and this had basically the same underlying flavor notes with elevated sourness and slightly elevated bitterness.
* **Workflow:** I purge the grouphead once before I start brewing. Grind the beans into the little cup that comes with the DF64, transfer to the portafilter and very gently distribute the grinds a little bit with my finger before tamping (I know...I need to buy something to help distribute the grinds). Tamp it down and pull with the default pre-infusion of about 8 seconds. This workflow has yielded success with multiple other coffees.

Based on the resources I've read (including the guide on this subreddit), I should be looking to drop the dose and go with a finer grind size. But my basket (the one that came with my Breville) has tapered walls, and if I put in anything less than \~18 grams of this coffee my tamper starts hitting the walls. From my experimentation it seems like the only taste parameters I can control are sourness and bitterness; the actual flavor is always covered by one or both of these.

So all this leaves me wondering if it's my equipment that's lacking, specifically my basket. Should I be looking to buy a precision basket that lets me use a smaller dose and finer grind size? Is there some combination of parameters I can try that may yield better results? Something I'm missing entirely? On the other hand, do very high elevation coffees like this just have more delicate flavor profiles? If this is the case, I feel like I could dial in on a happy medium of low-ish acidity and low-ish bitterness, and enjoy the faint fruity notes for what they are.

Me and my boyfriend of 101 days broke up 4 days ago, his reasoning was that he had commitments and needed to work towards his gcse’s and his future job in the military going to harrogate and becoming an rlc driver.
 The whole thing broke out after i had a roung day and needed someone to talk to which i assumed would be okay for me to go to him seing as he constantly tells me that i csn go to him if i need someone to talk to, along with plenty of other words like ill give up time if my need to but persists to pick his guy friend over me every time.
  
Anyways i was telling him about my day and he was giving me short replies and as usual not giving me anything to make me feel better as i do with him when he cries in my arms..

So naturally i was feeling down and upset about my other troubles and he was out playing darts woth his friend so i was like
""Can you stop being a pussy and listen to me""
And he was like ""that hurts then you call me that"" and so i counter argued and said ""well if you couldnt tell i was hurt after you say you are allways there""
 and then this is really where the argument picked up and got worse
 with him constantly picking up the fact that i called him that name because i was upset and speaking through my frustration on why he his words werent matching his actions and i apologised  many times repetitively  begging for him just to stop and listen to what i had to say and i asked him “ do you even remember why i was upset in the first place” and he said that i didnt explain  it properly when he was the one to busy to read the few detailed  sentences i had said about my day and so he forced me to scroll all the way up on our chat to find it,  and by this time it was late at night and i was balling my eyes out whist he was in the darts centre i later found out that his friend left early despite knowing i was upset he stayed there on his own..
I was then begging for it to end with the endless repetitive statments from him of
“why did you call me a pussy”
“ thats not what i am it hurts me you would say that”
“idk i think its the name calling”
And so on so i was begging and for a breif night i managed to tame the situation after him not listening or caring and my constant apologies.
  by about 2 in the morning i was then turned to reassuring him that he isnt a pussy and that it was all my fault and im deeply sorry despite from the start i just wanted someone i thought i could trust to comfort me this one time

2 / 3
We slept that night but then by morning when i had pulled my self together i said maturely and no through emotion that i am sorry for how i called him a pussy and that it wasnt right and that i should have comunicated better and more clearly to him at the time that i was upset but we need to respect eachother more and likewise put in equal efforts to be there for eachother and our actions needs to match our words.
Also bringing up that i am a 14 almost 15 year old from the uk and so i make 5 pounds an hour and work whenever i can and was finding that i was working my ass off scrubbing toilets cleaning, waitressing, gardening and everything to spend on him and his expensisive taste on dates he wanted to go on and no he never asked to pay but it was implyied with the promise of once im in harrogate im going to me making such and such and be able to spoil you, so i was at loss of all the money i made over summer and continued to pay in full for all our dates for the both of us becuase he was trying to find a job but no one would suposedly take him which i appreciate his efforts but i bought that up that ""hey this isnt how equality works and once in a while can wwe either agree to go 50/50 or find cheaper alternatives dates to go on that are a little easier on my bank accont"" considering id be spenting over 100 on  his birthday alone and the average date we would go on would range between 20-60 pounds out of my pocet  and we'd do this every week to every other week over weekends
But again all i got from that is him bringing up that i called him a pussy and that hes trying his best to get a job and its not fair on him  
Dispite me just imposing we did cheaper alternatives for example instead of going to the cinema and dinner after that he came to my place and watched a movie and had dinner at home so i could save a bit of cash instead of being forced to spend spend spend.

Nevertheless despite all my effort to comunicate he had nothing to say but  
""Look i have comitments coming up and your arguing is dragging me down and i cant take it  
With asesments coming up and gcse’s and its just not going to work out""
And i asked him  so why are you dumping me and he said i dont know i think its cause you called me a pussy and i was balling my eyes out and stressing despite me just wanting someone to give me eqaul respect and listen
So i went to school a wreck and all he had to say was that he accepts  my apology for calling him a pussy and that he just cant do it anymore
Ive tried and dwelled to see where i went wrong and i do love him dearly and have given him everything
3 / 3
Like my first kiss and we would have intimste moments and sorry to be blut but whenever we where in his house it would allways be him trying to make advances on me in the beginning wanting head,  but not giving it to me after more of a token lick.. and i know this all sounds so wrong considering im 14 years old but but the time we where around half way through our hangout before thr breakup i was so fucked up i sat there in his room wanting it and almost expecting it because yes ofc i felt plessure and some twisted part of my head thought it was normal to feel this way with a boyfriend (he is a year and 1 month older then me)
He proceded to want to see my body so i would send him pictures of myself and he had seen my whole body naked and kept the pictures on his my eyes only on his snapchat
But as a girl I'm not sure how im meant to react after giving all of yourself up like that even giving into his kinks and calling him daddy and i just was convincd that we were both msture enough to work through the struggles but the way he dropped me like that makes me feel useless wasted and used... for his sick game
And i dont like it but i did like how it was when we where together and how fun the times where when we where holding hands or even in the intimate mments i just wanted to be close to him and i have it all i had and tried my best for him but there is only so much i cound have done  
Now its been 4 days ive kept in contact with his mum and sister because i care and wanted to at least hear and see how he was doing but its not the same and i want nothing more right now but to have him back so this pain stopped so im considering either texing him and seeing if we can talk it out over call or coffee and making sence of it all in a week or 2 time... or texting him with solutions of me never calling him a name again and trying again without the arguments or texting his mum asking if she has any advise on how to re-kindle the relationship so we both go back to being a happy couple i dont know who was in the wrong but i want nothing more but to go back to him cause i cant imagne letting go of him after evrything we have been through just like that and i am still holding on to a glimmer of home that his i love yous were truthful
I'm not asking who's wrong or right but need some advice on how I should approach the issue

In 2 Corinthians‬ ‭5‬:‭17, the apostle Paul writes to the church in Corinth: “Anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!”

God created us and called us good, but we were born into a fallen world. A beautiful-yet-broken world. A stunning-yet-sinful world. A world where many would rather choose their own way instead of following and submitting to God. A world where others try to earn their own salvation, but fall painfully short. 

By the sheer grace of God, He has made a way for sinners through His Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus is the One who specializes in making all things new. 

Paul goes on to say in his letter: 

“And all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself through Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him.”
‭‭2 Corinthians‬ ‭5‬:‭18‬ ‭NLT‬‬

To reconcile, by definition, means to “make peace” or to “restore a relationship.”

If you’ve known the love, grace, forgiveness, and redemption of God, who—through Christ—reconciled you back to Himself, then you have everything you need to help others receive the same gift.

God has empowered you with the ministry of reconciliation—of restoring others back to Him. This reconciliation can happen anywhere: in coffee shops, in corporate offices, in classrooms, and in kitchens. You can remind a child about the grace that’s available to them when they make a mistake. You can remind an adult that they cannot sin so much or so badly they cannot receive the mercy of God.

Wherever people need God, He stands ready to be used by you.

The more I think about it, the more I really want to do this. It'll be a challenge for me. I've been knitting for decades, but I'm kind of a lazy knitter. I like simple patterns so I can watch tv at the same time. And I typically avoid charts as I find written patterns easier.

I’ve spent most of my career traveling for work.  Over 4000 nights logged across many brands, corporate apartments, and other short term leases.  A lot of my clients were in rural areas with limited lodging options or limited budgets.  Cereal, bread, some sort of dehydrated egg product, and breakfast meat - all served up with mediocre coffee.  But you know what, I like it.  

Traveling was a massive luxury for me as a kid.  Staying at a hotel was a very rare occurrence and meant the world to me and my little sister.  So when I got a job that led me to weekly travel and allowed me to see all parts of the country (and world with all of the miles and points), I can’t help but feel grateful.  Sure, it was exhausting, and often frustrating.  Travel delays and cancellations, spending the night in airports, room not ready, or whatever else you can possibly imagine.  I’ve seen it all.  But you know what - this overly processed, limited option, but free breakfast was always waiting for you in the morning to give you a little nudge of encouragement.  

I don’t travel as much for work these days, but when I do end up and one of these types of hotels, I can’t help but smile a little bit at the breakfast in the morning.  But don’t sleep in, because they lock that shit down at 9am on the dot.

Due to a former friend bad talking both of us to the other, we always had tension together. We both dropped the mutual friend. She approached me as an adult to clear the air, which I’m glad because turns out, she’s cool as hell!

Today, she told me her dialysis facility sent her to the ER due to her oxygen levels being dangerously low.

I made her a little card. Inside, I jested I’d give CPR whenever she needs (because our mouths would touch… it’s a kissing joke). Imma get a big, pretty bouquet of flowers and take our other bestie along to surprise her when she’s assigned a room (she’s getting admitted). 

Any other ideas of small comfort items to take her? I want her to feel the love. Let her know she has people in her corner that care about her. Obviously, I’ve stated to her she’s cared about. I want my actions to match. Aside from visiting her. Just some small things. Card, flowers, small coffee from a great café. What would make you feel cared for if you were in her position?

I'm about 5.5 weeks, so my own symptoms are pretty mild so far: aversion to coffee and fried foods, exhausted, and just a feeling of ""mild tightness"" in my abdominal region. Very similar to the same stage is my last two pregnancies. 
 
But, my word, I keep hearing about his digestive issues, and having stomach cramps, and being tired... maybe if you went to bed before midnight, knowing you get ip atv6am, you'd be less tired. Maybe if you eat some vegetables or fruit, you'd have fewer digestive issues. Maybe, if you stopped complaining about these self induced ailments, you'd be less likely to have a pillow to the face.

I'm using Steam (Runtime) and Proton Experimental (also tried Proton GE) and have a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB as GPU and a Intel CoffeeLake-S GT2 \[UHD Graphics 630\] CPU. When starting the game, I always wait until the ""Compiling shaders"" notice disappears.

The Game is running with highest settings on Windows with 60fps and I can archive the same with EndeavourOS. My problem is, that after around 2-3 games I exprience a sudden decrease of FPS down to around 20-30 and it stays like that until I restart the game. Furthermore, on some occasions, sometimes also related to tabbing out of the game and back in, the sound slowly starts to stutter and FPS start t o decrease until my system becomes completely unresponsive and requires a restart.

Below I provided the Launch Options (found some of them on ProtonDB) that I use for Steam and some logs with some error data (although I have no idea if they are relevant). I hope someone can assist.

1h0egvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1h0egvi/beginner_coffee_enthusiast_seeking_advice/,Beginner Coffee Enthusiast Seeking Advice: Espresso Machine or Aeropress?  ,"Hello coffee lovers,

Until a few months ago, I was a hardcore tea lover, but everything changed when I visited Rameshwaram Café in Bangalore this July. I tried filter coffee for the first time, and it was love at first sip! After returning home, I started with Kotha’s filter coffee decoction sachets and then moved on to instant coffees like Rage, Bevzilla, and Nescafé Gold.  

Here’s the thing: I really enjoy milk-based coffee with very little brown sugar or stevia. Recently, a friend gifted me ground coffee from Vietnam, and now I’m considering taking the next step in my coffee journey by investing in some brewing equipment.  

### My Budget: ₹15,000-₹20,000  
I’m the only coffee drinker at home, so this setup is just for me. Initially, I thought about starting with the Aeropress Clear, but since I can stretch my budget, I’ve been looking into entry-level espresso machines instead.  

### Shortlisted Espresso Machines:  
1. **Costar Espresso Machine** - ₹8,999  
2. **Rossmann Espresso** - ₹8,999  
3. **HiBREW H5** - ₹12,999  
4. **HiBREW H11** - ₹15,499  
5. **DeLonghi EC685.M Dedica** - ₹17,499 (best in class, but I’ve heard mixed reviews about service in India)  

I’m torn between going for a beginner espresso machine or starting small with something like the Aeropress. As a beginner, I’m looking for something that’s easy to use, fits my budget, and allows me to make creamy milk-based coffees like lattes and cappuccinos.  

### Questions:  
1. Should I go for an espresso machine or stick with something like the Aeropress and focus on manual brewing for now?  
2. Among the machines I’ve listed, which would you recommend for a beginner? Or is there a better option I’ve missed?  
3. Any tips for someone who’s just starting to explore the world of coffee?

I stopped talking the whole journey home, I was holding my best friend’s arm & eventually I was barely even able to walk. Her house came before mine so I sat down in the ground, trying not to pass out or throw up, & texted my dad to come & get me. He reached her house before we did, & since I couldn’t speak my best friend explained what was happening & they both grabbed my arms. I gave her a hug when we got to her house, but after that my dad was basically holding me up the whole way home, immediately sat me down on the couch & blasted the fan at me, he also gave me a huge bottle of water. I don’t think I ate much that night & I slept on the couch for the first time ever.

That had NEVER happened to me before but I have had a similar feeling multiple times since. It’s never been as bad as that, albeit now whenever I’m with someone & it happens they tell me to sit down & if they were doing something they’ll do it without me, so maybe I’ve just gotten okay with handling it, but it’s terrifying & I never want to experience that ever again.

The closest I’ve come to that since was yet again another day out with my best friend, we also went out for lunch that day, & went home a few hours later. By the time we got off the bus I was struggling to walk but it wasn’t far & I could make it myself, but I went home, straight to the toilet, & then straight to bed to basically pass out & I started sobbing.

I just passed the location it first happened in in the car & I doesn’t normally give me as much anxiety doing that, but today it’s kind of sent me spiralling. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to walk up there again, I used to do it pretty often but I genuinely haven’t walked up there since March. I’m terrified that that’s gonna happen again because that was the scariest thing that’s ever happened to me I literally didn’t feel alive, & everyone was so concerned. My best friend kept texting me with help & asking how I was after I got home because thankfully her granny used to be a doctor, so she was able to give some advice, but obviously she could only do so much. I don’t think I’ve ever been the same since that day, I’m genuinely traumatised, especially when I’m out with my best friend & it’s not fair bc she’s my favourite person in the whole world & I feel like I can’t properly enjoy being with her because of how beyond horrible I felt physically that one day.",3,1732634681.0,ChronicIllness,1,1.0,False

I cannot for the life of me figure out how to comfortable furnish my living room! 

At the bottom right is the front door (facing west) and entryway. It is only ever used for deliveries, for guests, or for fairly frequent unwanted solicitors. The detached garage is at the back of the house and so we always enter and exit through the back door.

That means the opening at the top is the main thoroughfare into and out of the living room. The adjacent room is the dining room and straight back from there is the kitchen and the back door. That means if you can see through that opening, you can see all the way to the back door in a straight line.

The door on the left is an exterior door that goes to a covered porch in the side yard of the house. It is mostly used to let the dog in and out.

The main uses of the living room are sitting with my wife in the morning to drink our coffee and read and to watch tv together in the evenings. The fireplace is a spanish style (our home is a tudor revival) and so even if I wanted to place the tv above the fireplace there would be no where to hang it.

I've also attached the current layout, which is mostly furniture we brought over from a bigger house and placed before I knew anything about feng shui. It'd be nice to fit some sort of sofa in here and not just have arm chairs strewn about but I'm at a total loss, I can't even confidently point to where the command position should be, let alone where to put the tv!",1,1732634671.0,FengShui,0,1.0,False

Je me permet de poser cette question afin de connaitre la legalite du cas suivant:

\-Un employeur.e peux-t-elle/il interdire l'utilisation d'une langue au travaille?  


Voici le contexte:  
Dans le café où mon ami travaille, on parle rarement français. On parle français avec les clients français, mais la plupart du temps, on parle anglais avec les clients, car ce sont des touristes. Le patron, d’origine australienne, parle lui-même anglais avec les employés. Dans le coffee shop, elles sont quatre employées. L’une d’entre elle est française, elle parle donc français, et moyennement aussi l’anglais. Les trois autres employées, dont mon amie, sont russes ou ukrainiennes. La russe est étudiante, les deux ukrainiennes sont réfugiées. Tout le monde est en CDI. Ces trois employées parlent très peu français. Elles communiquent avec l’employée française, et avec le patron, en anglais. Leur niveau d’anglais est correct, voire bon, donc la communication est possible même si imparfaite. Entre elles, pendant leurs heures de travail au coffee shop, elles parlent russe (pour pouvoir communiquer de manière plus simple). Le patron n’aime pas ça, alors il leur a récemment interdit de parler russe pendant leur travail, et leur a imposé l’anglais comme langue pour la communication entre employées. Le patron a-t-il le droit d’interdire aux employées d’utiliser leur langue maternelle pendant le travail ? Je répète qu’elles communiquent en anglais ou français avec les clients, et qu’il s’agit bien de communications entre elles uniquement, concernant leurs taches au travail, et occasionnellement concernant des sujets personnels, comme tous collègues font de temps en temps.

She was genuinely special, though. When I look back, I realize she was the one who made me feel real emotions.

I just moved to a super high volume store and everyone there is so drained and tired. Morale is super low constantly, nobody has the energy to try, and management is a mess. 

I always give it my all and come home super drained. I try to prep the best I can before peak, and I’m usually out of gas by 11 am-ish. 

Yesterday a fellow barista told me that I do too much and that I need to conserve my energy better, but if I don’t try and cover our bases, important things don’t get done. 

For instance, yesterday before peak we had 0 fruit inclusion back ups. If I didn’t finish my other tasks as an opener, I wouldn’t have seen it, it wouldn’t have gotten done, and we would’ve been screwed mid-peak.

How do you respond to someone like this? I told her I wasn’t going to stop trying, and she said that I should try, just not so hard.

I felt like if everyone pressed on the gas a little more as a team instead of pockets of baristas doing heavy lifting, then maybe we wouldn’t be so behind on prep and tasks all the time. And I’m not saying move at the speed of light, or try to complete Karen’s order before she can breathe, but just like…try at all? 

My store has one barista who consistently lint rolls her apron on the clock. She takes it off, lays it out on the pastry case bench, prints out a piece of sticker tape, and pulls lint off her apron with it for 10 minutes every open while drinking her coffee. She will completely ignore her tasks and leave sandwiches the way they were shipped. She won’t fifo or condense them, or date them sometimes even. 

 Her behavior is simply ignored; because our opening shift lead is a longtime friend of many of the older, jaded partners.

I know it’s hard, and I don’t expect anyone to go above and beyond, but I just wish instead of being told to slow down and match them, I got a little more help. 

I just feel like I’m damned if I do, and damned if I don’t here. I either give up and come home with more energy but peak goes awful everyday, or I keep trying and wait for things to get better.

We are currently planning the layout of our house and want to take the kitchen into account right from the start. The walls and door positions can therefore still be adapted. 



**Do you have any suggestions for improving the kitchen layout?**



We have a pantry right next to the kitchen, so we need less storage space for food.

We really like the additional work surface provided by the kitchen island and we want to have a small seating area for a quick coffee in the morning, so the kitchen island is actually quite practical for that too.



I'm still a bit unhappy with the position of the sink and the cooktop. I'd actually like the sink to be more central in the kitchen. We want to make the hob with an integrated downdraft, so we don't need an exhaust fan.

I’m spilling the tea ☕ on the 3 biggest things I wish someone had told me when I began this wild adventure:

1️⃣ You DON’T need to show your face to make an impact.
Forget the pressure of being on camera 24/7! You can share videos of your pets 🐶🐱, travel clips from Miami 🌴, or even everyday moments, like making coffee. With the right tools—like Threads Booster—you can turn these into stories that SELL while staying completely faceless.

2️⃣ Be authentic through your words.
Faceless doesn’t mean you’re hiding. Use your story to connect! Why did you choose to stay faceless? 🧐 What are your goals? The more you share your struggles and wins, the deeper your connection will be. (Trust me—your audience LOVES vulnerability!)

3️⃣ Automations are EVERYTHING.
The key to sustainable success? AI-driven automations. 🤖✨ With Threads Booster and my Freedom Fusion System, you’ll learn hybrid skills to save time, monetize your commute, and grow across platforms like Threads—all while cuddling with your pets or exploring new cities!

I was diagnosed at 31yo a couple of months ago and the meds help tremendously, but I can only take them 2-3 days a week because the sleep deprivation is so terrible. 

My doctor said this was common with vyvanse because of the slow release, so he switched me to to adderall (it’s not the XR), but the problem has persisted. 

I’ve tried the normal tricks. I take the meds when I wake up at 6:30am, eat a high protein breakfast. Take a vitamin C supplement in the evening and supplement magnesium l-threonate; no luck. 

I drink two cups of coffee per day and I usually finish the second one around lunchtime. Could that be it? It’s hard to believe 200-250mg of caffeine in combination with adderall could be keeping me awake for 20 hours. Plus, isn’t adderall supposed to mostly metabolize around 6 hours? I’m going to cut caffeine entirely and see if that helps. 

I’m pretty desperate. Being diagnosed and medicated has given me new life but sleep is a non-negotiable. I appreciate any help/tips. Thanks. ",1,1732633643.0,ADHD,4,1.0,False

I used to have worsening IC with my period, the cramps would bring worsened nerve pain and urgency as my bladder was squeezed down too. Now 17 months after having a baby pretty much every period I've had the past 10 months has come with vanishing IC during the WORST cramping of day one and/or two. I tell you I don't feel my bladder at all other when it's reasonably time to pee and it's not painful or super loud alarm bells, like how my bladder was preIC. I can even consume coffee and my bladder won't respond to it during the cramping but I will pay for it once the worst cramping stops around day 3, I can feel all the irritation I may have created consuming coffee or soda in my IC-free bliss (I'm learning restraint here lol)

This is all so odd to me and I don't understand it. The cramps are pretty awful, stopped in my tracks and got nauseous earlier today for reference. I don't necessarily think it's hormone because I genuinely only notice it when the cramping is awful. Last night I had light cramps and IC, today awful cramps no IC, and by day 3 when the cramps get the a lesser level the IC will be back full force as usual. 

I wonder if it has to do with my brain and pain signals? Everything I've read indicates that the bladder is seemingly involved in the cramping and bladder symptoms can occur for people without IC during cramping. During labor I felt my bladder/IC with each contraction. Maybe the brain neurofeedback is preoccupied with my uterus? Genuinely just so curious about mechanisms and pathology of this crazy illness.

What do you speculate or think would be good rabbit holes to read about?

Ultimately any time I experience relief I like to think about what could be the mechanism contributing and could I replicate it so I do kind of get on these rabbit holes of exploration when I do experience any remission or break in the symptoms understandably so, right?",2,1732633634.0,Interstitialcystitis,2,1.0,False

I've been a huge coffee enthusiast for over a decade now, and I wanted to share my experience with finding the perfect coffee maker. After trying countless machines and spending way too much money on cafe-bought coffee, I've finally figured out what makes a great coffee machine worth buying.

First off, let's talk about what actually matters when choosing a coffee maker. It's not just about getting the fanciest machine with all the bells and whistles. Trust me, I learned this the hard way!

The key factors I consider most important are:

1. Brewing Temperature
A good coffee maker needs to heat water between 195-205°F for optimal extraction. Anything less and you're getting weak, under-extracted coffee.

2. Ease of Use
Nobody wants to struggle with complicated settings first thing in the morning. The best machines I've found are straightforward but still give you control over your brew.

3. Durability
I've gone through several cheap machines that broke within months. Investing in a quality maker actually saves money long-term.

After testing dozens of machines, I've found some excellent options for different needs and budgets. You can check out my top recommendations here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

For beginners, I highly recommend starting with a drip coffee maker. They're reliable, easy to use, and make consistently good coffee. If you're more adventurous, espresso machines can be amazing but require more learning and maintenance.

Pro tip: Whatever machine you choose, always use freshly ground beans. It makes a HUGE difference in taste!

Some features worth paying extra for:
- Programmable timer (amazing for morning coffee)
- Built-in grinder
- Temperature control
- Auto shut-off

Features you can skip:
- Bluetooth connectivity
- Fancy LED displays
- Multiple brew strength settings

I've put together a detailed guide with current prices and reviews here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

Remember, the best coffee machine is the one that fits YOUR specific needs and routine. Don't get caught up in marketing hype or feel pressured to buy the most expensive option.

What I've learned is that investing in a quality coffee maker actually saves money compared to daily cafe visits. Plus, there's something really satisfying about making your perfect cup at home.

Hope this helps you find your ideal coffee maker! Feel free to ask any questions about specific models or features - I'm always happy to help fellow coffee lovers!",1,1732633438.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

This is the second in an occasional series of old-fashioned web logs recording brief streams of thoughts, and sent out indiscreetly.

I'm appreciative of those who reacted with interest or curiosity in the writing. It's decidedly not for everyone, but the people who skim parts or read it all already deserve compliments. I've since enabled PMs only as it's difficult to stay on top of the…IMs. There's a quaintness to email-like asynchronous conversation, so let's try it until there's more to say face-to-face or over a call.

Yes, I am indeed male and straight, clarifying for those who were looking for romantic relationships. I am also interested in close friendships with broad conversation and outdoor activities, but to triple-reiterate: I am male and look somewhat like my recently drawn portrait.

""So what's up with the username?!"" some internet stranger screams, shaking a fist at the clouds and tearing hair from its roots (probably). A camellia is a fast-growing but remarkably pure late-bloomer, or maybe to the contrarian an overly precocious and pretentious early-bloomer. With ancestry in the East, some might be drawn to its family of the tea ""cha"" plant, but I don't really have a refined taste. Outside of appreciating beverages for the occasional culinary or social reason, I'm a simple person and my favorite drink is water. 

But femininity online can still stick out as much as it did in 2004. Flowers, amirite? Women ☕️

Gender is a sticky subject for small talk, but hot topics aren't the worst for getting to know a person.  I admire people with the principles or instincts to live life without concern for others' perception of identity, gender or otherwise. To find their own balance. I'm musing on a previously passing thought: yin and yang.

Yin and yang isn't just Eastern philosophy and symbolism introduced into the sphere of Western philosophy for the sake of kitschy commercialism and spiritual contrarianism. It's a simple representation of balance in life for the world around and the individual. And as a component of personal philosophy or introspective diet, it needs to be continually pondered and sought. It's the balance of dark and light, stillness and energy, the moon and sun. It's the duality of femininity and masculinity and its tenderness and strength, peace and aggression, negativity and positivity. It's a dichotomy that, like any other, invites obsession in forming a binary identity instead of seeking the natural equilibrium opposing forces can be brought to.

Well, I'd happily listen to those who have something to say there, or those have more experience in Taoism, Buddhism, derivative Zen, or whatever. It's a broad concept that expands into all sorts of philosophies, ideologies, and even traditional medicine that I'm definitely not well-read on. The more practical topic to be familiar with at this stage in life might be internality and externality. And that duality is far from a stranger to Western philosophy, which today might see feminine pop-psy toting Myers-Briggs and introversion or overly masculine flavors of modern Stoicism drawing loosely from classical Stoicism. 

So, yeah…gender. We all have our own balance that's likely not wholly categorized nor moved only by external force. Go hunt, catch a trout, and sew a hem. Go dance, read a rom-com, and saw a plank. Wouldn't it be a shame to reject half of life solely for something as trivial as reinforcing an identity? How unhealthy for the mind and body to avoid either rest or wakefulness. How unsustainable a civilization would be to only decay in peace or mire in war.

Today's breakfast: omurice, with a side snack of rustic matcha macarons. That's right, we're going full French+Japan gimmick. As an invention, a custardy French-style omelette wrapping fried rice is magical, like how roasting marshmallows over yams yields something transcendent as it crisps on the surface and the starches below all melt together and become one.

[https://i.imgur.com/Z8cp7vW.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/Z8cp7vW.jpeg)

* A cup and a half of leftover rice or freshly-cooked washed rice
* A spoonful chicken powder, bouillon, or dashi
* A couple squeezes ketchup (for flavoring fried rice, with extra to top)
* 3 eggs, beaten, salted, and mixed with a splash of water or dashi

Regarding cha and its mǒ／まっ variety, 抹茶: matcha is one tea I easily took to. And not at all one I would have expected to like when I was a kid and only wanted jasmine tea à la dim sum. Matcha's suspended creaminess and delicate floral taste is quickly whisked out of cool or warm water, without any pretense of Japanese tea ceremony.

And matcha, coffee, and cocoa powder are great for naturally coloring macarons, which are sensitive to moisture and therefore widely baked with petroleum-based food coloring. I was looking at the label for an EU snack that contained an E140 dye — apparently just chlorophyll, which matcha uniquely has even among other green teas. If you've also ever tried to color baked goods with a fruit reduction, you know it takes waaay too much to keep the color. Apparently powdered freeze-dried berries work well too, and I'll give that a try with mortar & pestle some time. Trader Joe's stocks assorted freeze-dried berries, RIGHT NOW. Who'd figure? No more looking at weird emergency ration fruit.

On the topic of coloring with berries, this time's practice art is watercolor watermelon. Yep, time to dig up the one fun fact that melons are botanically berries. And possibly among the top 3 best fruits overall, if not top 1.

He has TWO cat trees. Between both cat trees there are 7 scratching posts on them. He also has a stand alone tall vertical scratcher, and a corrugated horizontal scratcher and more toys then I had as a child. Fountains.

Despite having everything for claw maintenance at his leisure and uses them regularly. I even leave CatTV streaming for him while I'm away. He still turns to carpet corners, and edges. I've tried the sprays and they seem to work but I'm gone 14hrs at a time and the instructions say 4x a day to use it.   I finally turned to double sided tape yesterday on his most frequent spots. And it worked well, at just making him find another place to scratch the carpet. My throw rug that my coffee table sits on is the latest victim.  I feel I'm at a lose lose battle here. Every time I eliminate one carpet outlet for him to scratch he just resorts to finding a new one. I can't sticky tape my entire apartment and I can't keep buying sprays and I feel awful as a new adopter that I must be doing something wrong.",1,1732633161.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

I do also drink regular black coffee though and the machine has a preset for that. The coffee it makes is really tasty but freaking TINY. What you see in the mug is two runs of the regular coffee preset.

There is a lungo option but it’s kinda weak, so for the future I’m considering just combining a regular and a lungo for my “standard” cup of coffee. Or hell, I might just pull an espresso and add hot water to make an americano.

But I just wanna make sure… am I doing something wrong here? Are my grind settings too aggressive or something? Because I find it hard to believe that the coffee is supposed to be so tiny.",2,1732633002.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

I've recently gotten into chess and have been enjoying learning the game. However, spending hours at the computer isn't really my thing, so I'm looking to meet up with some like-minded people for some casual over-the-board (OTB) games.

It doesn't matter how good you are—I consider myself a beginner, and this is more about having fun and enjoying the game. Whether it's at a coffee shop, a park, or over a beer, I'm open to any relaxed setting.

If you're in the area and would be interested, feel free to drop a comment or send me a message, and we can set something up!",1,1732632932.0,Leuven,1,1.0,False

Been weaning myself off of caffiene for months now. Started with one cup of coffee a day, then down to one cup of black tea, and now I'm switching to one cup of green tea. 

My green tea will run out in about a month which lines up with a couple weeks I have off work at the end of December. So I'm thinking of using that time to quit caffeine altogether. 

I've always been really sensitive to caffeine. My biggest withdrawal symptom are these killer pounding headaches I'll get. Like 9/10 on the pain scale. They keep me from sleeping and I have a hard time concentrating on anything. OTC pain medication doesn't really work either. 

I realize I'm going to have to just suck it up and get through it if this is something I want. But I think the hardest thing for me is passing the time while I'm in pain.

So for all those that have ascended to caffiene-freedom before me, how did you pass the time while you suffered the effects of withdrawal? ",1,1732632857.0,decaf,3,1.0,False
1h0doov,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1h0doov/spices_smell_different_after_grinding_them/,Spices smell different after grinding them?,"For 2 years, I've been buying different spices, and grinding them myself in an electric coffee grinder.

I did that with cloves and cardamom today, and noticed something.  
Right after grinding the clove pods, they smelled pretty flat - especially compared to the whole cloves I still have left. It was almost as if grinding them removed 80% of all aroma.

15 minutes later, I open the glass again, and noticed the grounds smelled as expected. The same thing happened with the cardamom I ground up today. I'm confused... how does that happen? I don't think that's happened before.

For context: I've been having doubts about my sense of smell since root canal treatment I had 4 weeks ago. I was given an antibiotic (only locally, inside the tooth). Noticed the cardamom I ground up didn't smell as intensely as usual, even though it's from the same seller as always.  
Asked my dentist, she said antibiotics can affect the sense of smell, but since I was only given them locally, they shouldn't affect my sense of smell. She suspects I might have had a mild case of Covid which affected my sense of smell. It sometimes feels like I'm missing 10 to 25% of my sense, but not always.

My role however was to take my grandma out every once in a while (she didn’t leave the apartment unless I were to take her out for coffee). However I do feel like I witnessed my grandpa’s deterioration up close. It started with Covid, he never had it but it stopped him from going outside and engaging with the world, as well as driving.
He quickly lost ability to speak our language and switched to polish (his mother tongue) without realizing it. Quickly later it progressed to diapers, running away from home, becoming violent towards my grandma, and so on.
The last 2 years he lost ability to talk at all. He signed like a baby. Couldn’t eat solids. 
This last year he didn’t leave his bed and laid with his mouth open, looking pretty much dead. 
It was horrible to witness, I felt very helpless and horrified to see my grandpa, who before this terrible illness was so sharp, did crosswords, drove and was an independent person all around. 
His death marks the end of a really difficult era in which I couldn’t understand why his body wasn’t giving up already. He officially lost all functioning ability a while ago. My grandma was miserable and so was everyone else. Anyway, he drew his last breath yesterday, and I feel as if I have been grieving for these entire 4 years. I do feel like an need to process these 4 years more than I need to  actually grieve him.
I feel for everyone in this community, and hope that with science and medicine, humanity will eventually learn to overcome this devastating illness. ",10,1732632811.0,dementia,3,1.0,False

Uncovering my trauma from childhood and past failed marriages was something that had to be done in order for me to find peace not only within myself but with others who either hurry me or impacted me negatively.. I was so full of anger inside and the whirlwind of emotions often left me so confused and mentally exhausted.. After about 10 months I began to finally release all of my negative thoughts, feelings, emotions that affected and infected not just me and my chakra but also ones around me. I began writing to the universe on Reddit as I knew it was as safe as I could get to explore myself and who I’ve become without fear of being known.. It was then that my life began to change.. For about a week, I was searching for answers and advice without asking any questions and unfortunately reading reactions from others with similar situations.. I then started to realize that so many people are just “ wandering “ , searching, and yelling for … someone to listen. Well… for me, I found myself healed and was on the right path of becoming… becoming a better version of myself. I didn’t know if I wanted a relationship and I knew my guard was up from the idea of loving someone again.. I was enough for myself.. 
until the day I would become Tested…
Fast forwarding… I started talking to someone behind a screen.. I had no idea who they were, what sex , color or creed they were.. nor did i care because I enjoyed the conversation.. It was RAW, honest without judgement and so safe.. Until … gloves came off and curiosity became heightened.. 
The TEST.. I failed miserably.. I knew it was dangerous to myself.. in fact, I heard it several times.. I said it to her several times.. We both ignored.. So.. we are here.. 
We decided to meet as I had business not far from her.. I flew across the map with struggles i overcame and damn it!!! We fell … The long talks never ended, the wrapping up in sheets and minds.. unexplainable.. time became way too short… As fast as it started something ended.. I know she’s on her journey and I know enough about her that she’s going to become a very bright light.. My test was to love and not harbor anger.. As I sit here, I can smile a little knowing someone I could love unconditionally and be loved by does exist.. Mmm it stings some but that was normal even being away a few days without her.. And as Forest Gump says… “ That’s all I Gota say about that “.. I sure miss my “ Jenny “ though.. Such is life…",0,1732632765.0,UnsentLetters,2,0.5,False

He picked me up when I arrived by bus early in the morning and I had a coffee with him because it was too early for check-in in my accommodation.
He told me stories of tours he did with other travelers and recommended me doing it too because of the bad weather in the region at the moment. He showed me pictures and a notebook with a lot of entries from other people in diffrent languages telling how good it was to travel with him. So, the next day he picked me up again to show me around and I agreed on doing a 5-day tour with him to Da Lat.
He seems fine and friendly but when he dropped me off he asked to borrow 2'000'000VND to get gas and oil for his bike.
This seemed to be a bit suspicious too me and since I'm traveling alone I'm now a bit unsure about the situation. And usually I avoid offers like these but it was the notebook with the many entries in all kinds of languages saying it was a good decision to do the tour with him.

I wanted to share something that’s really helped me boost my productivity and stay focused—especially when working on tasks that require deep concentration.

I’ve been using the Pomodoro Technique for a while now, and I found that combining it with a gentle chime at the end of each interval makes it much easier to stick to the routine. To make things easier, I created two versions of a Pomodoro timer with 25-minute focus sessions and 5-minute breaks. They’re simple, structured, and totally free of distractions—no ads or interruptions.

Here’s the link if you want to try them out:

**With Brown Noise**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj922g5A1ZQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj922g5A1ZQ)

**Silent:**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp6m72k3iNM&t=10s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp6m72k3iNM&t=10s)

I personally prefer the brown noise version as it adds extra focus for me, but the silent timer allows you to layer your own favorite ambience (like rain or coffee shop sounds). Both feature a gentle chime to signal the beginning and end of each focus session and break.

I’d really appreciate your feedback as this is part of a new channel I’m building, and I want to make the content as helpful as possible. Are there other features or types of content you’d like to see?

If you’re someone who thrives on structured work sessions or struggles to focus for long periods, I think you might find these helpful. The channel also includes other focus tools like white noise, countdown timers, and ambient soundscapes—all designed to help you stay productive and relaxed.

Let me know if you give it a try! I’d love to hear how you use it or if you have other productivity tools that work for you.",1,1732632479.0,pomodoro,0,1.0,False
1h0dk41,https://www.reddit.com/r/geneticlifehacks/comments/1h0dk41/coffee_consumption_changes_the_microbiome/,Coffee consumption changes the microbiome,"There's an interesting new study out on the microbiome changes from coffee consumption. The bacteria identified is a butyrate-producing bacteria. This may explain some of the positive connections between coffee and health. 

[Coffee consumption is associated with intestinal Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus abundance and prevalence across multiple cohorts](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01858-9)

Abstract: ""Although diet is a substantial determinant of the human gut microbiome, the interplay between specific foods and microbial community structure remains poorly understood. Coffee is a habitually consumed beverage with established metabolic and health benefits. We previously found that coffee is, among >150 items, the food showing the highest correlation with microbiome components. Here we conducted a multi-cohort, multi-omic analysis of US and UK populations with detailed dietary information from a total of 22,867 participants, which we then integrated with public data from 211 cohorts (*N* = 54,198). The link between coffee consumption and microbiome was highly reproducible across different populations (area under the curve of 0.89), largely driven by the presence and abundance of the species *Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus*. Using in vitro experiments, we show that coffee can stimulate growth of *L.* *asaccharolyticus*. Plasma metabolomics on 438 samples identified several metabolites enriched among coffee consumers, with quinic acid and its potential derivatives associated with coffee and *L.* *asaccharolyticus*. This study reveals a metabolic link between a specific gut microorganism and a specific food item, providing a framework for the understanding of microbial dietary responses at the biochemical level.""

I'm a 20-year-old girl from Chennai looking to connect with other amazing women for a fun, genuine friendship. I’m already surrounded by some great friends in college, but I figured why not expand my circle? I’m all about finding someone I can vibe with—someone I can text endlessly about random things, share memes, exchange deep late-night thoughts, and basically just have a great time chatting.

A little bit about me: I’m a chill, easygoing person who loves to laugh and find joy in the little things. I can get excited about the most random stuff, as you can probably tell by my typing “HEHEHE.” I promise I’m not always this hyper, but hey, life’s better when you’re having fun, right?

I’m into movies, music, binge-watching shows, and exploring new places. Whether it’s recommending playlists, talking about life’s ups and downs, or just sharing our daily little wins and struggles, I’d love to connect with someone who’s up for good vibes and genuine conversations. Bonus points if you’re into spontaneous plans or virtual coffee hangouts!

Also, if you’re wondering whether this is some kind of catfish situation, don’t worry—I’m totally up for verifying via a voice call or even just chatting live if that makes you more comfortable. I completely understand that safety and trust come first when making new connections online.

If this sounds like something you’re interested in, feel free to reach out! Whether you’re from Chennai or somewhere else, I’d love to hear about your world, share mine, and see where our conversations take us. Let’s start this friendship journey and see how it goes!

I want to build a pivot which shows a response to this question: ""Give me descriptions of the apps used in Germany (Poland, any other)"". Data is quite a huge multiple table combined dataset pulled from multiple sources via PQ, so  I perform all the queries in PQ/DM, with no direct formula involved (may be as well done in PowerBI).

So basically querying parent table with respect to the child table's subset.

1h0d9p4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pessimism/comments/1h0d9p4/some_thoughts_on_creating_life/,Some thoughts on creating life ,"Didn't want to post it on the antinatalism subreddits (maybe I should've), also playing a bit of the devil's advocate here:

You're older than you think. You are a system that was created over 300 000 years ago by something powerful that's approximately 13,8 billion years old. That's your real parent, the universe. Why do people get mad at living organisms for procreaing when it's the universe that makes it possible in the first place? 

Some people say brining a person into existence is bad. But the thing is, you can't bring anyone into existence as in you can't ""create"" anyone. Do you create a human from scratch like the existence did hundreds of millions of years ago? No, it only takes 9 quick months. How is it ""creating life""? If I make a cup of coffee, do I create coffee? I only take the ingredients that's already existed and turn them into a different state. Nobody blinks an eye because coffee is not conscious and I don't get people yelling at me that I committed a crime by making myself some coffee. However, because consciousness feels so real, all of a sudden I'm committing a crime when I just change the state of the ingredients (turn an egg and a sperm into a baby).* 

Creating a baby is too simple, you don't need to have a PhD in chemistry. People don't view it as ""taking a soul out of non-existence"" like antinatalists do. For them it's something as simple as turning a stone. The universe makes it possible!

Hence the suffering will never end, not through extinctionism at least. Get rid of the universe first and what made its existence possible

I get to work at 11pm. I was anxious the entire time I was getting ready for work, as well as the drive there. Alice is at work already, but not at the desk. The in-house bar/restaurant was slammed so she helped out there until they slowed down around 1am, then she came to the desk. 

Nothing crazy happened. I would say we were both more relaxed and friendly through the night rather than our usual flirty dynamic, which I was honestly thankful for because it meant that we were actually able to get to know each other a little. We both cracked open an ice cold can of ""family bs/trauma"" and skimmed the surface of that. I told her about my brother assaulting my other brother and getting arrested recently, and other bs from the dysfunctional tree that is my family, and she told me a bit about her dysfunctional family. After a while of talking, I told her congrats because now she knows more about me than anyone else in the building, which she was really happy to hear and seemed proud of the fact. 

The most “risque” conversation was when we were talking about weed/thc and I made a comment that I'm sadly sober tonight, but I usually bring mine with me just to get a little buzz to make the time pass faster. She offered me a hit of hers and I declined, saying it wasn't a good idea for me to be high rn *(I immediately kicked myself for saying, because she asked why)*

I hesitated to answer but she kept prying for a response, so I admitted “I can't be around…” had to look away from her because I started to blush “...pretty women when I'm high.” 

Of course, now she's even more curious and asked “Oh? Why's that?” with a curious little head tilt. I didn't dare look at her, but I could feel her eyes burning into me. Curious. Searching. Unmoving. 

I laughed, saying “I just get flustered really easily and stutter a lot and I'm pretty clumsy when I am, so it's just not a wise choice. Plus it's a Saturday, so better to be sober in case anything crazy happens."" Which was half truth. The other half of the truth is I'd started crushing on her and I get not only horny when I'm high but also I'm very honest and ramble a lot, so I didn't trust that I wouldn't confess my crush on her if I was high and alone with her for 5 hours. 

She immediately offered to give me one of her vapes if I want to hit it later. I politely declined, but after much protest, she slipped one of her vapes into my pocket, telling me to keep it for now and if I want to I can hit it after she leaves so that I'm comfortable. This was around 2:30am. She was only scheduled to 4am, but I told her she was welcome to leave at 3 since I know she's probably tired. She insisted on staying til 4, but because we spent most of the night talking about life, our pasts, exes, fears, aspirations, goals, our personal struggles, how we're both secretly extremely anxious and over-analystic people, etc, she didn't end up leaving until 5am. The only reason she did leave at that moment is because one of the other managers came in and interrupted our conversation. 

(Also little bonus, at one point she was talking about being hit on by men and was like ""Like I can't stand when people comment on how good I look. Like 'damn baby you're looking good tonight.' 'You look fine as fuck.' like no shut the fuck up and compliment my laugh or my mind or something."" Immediately I felt bad, cause the last few months I'd been telling her how nice she looks in various outfits. Feeling like an ass, I apologized, saying ""Oh I'm so sorry, if I knew you were uncomfortable with it I wouldn't have been complimenting your outfits! In all fairness I'm genuinely complimenting the outfit, not like oggling you in it, I promise. But again I'm very sorry,"" Alice very quickly said ""No, you're good. It's different coming from you, cause I know you don't mean it in a skeezy way."" Shortly after that convo is when the other manager got in)

I spent the whole week thinking about that night because the conversation was just so fun and easy with her, especially compared to the person I've been casually seeing the last couple of months *(like we have one two-hour coffee date every two weeks and they've already established that they don't want to talk about having a committed relationship until after the new year)* 

Nov 10th 

I received a text from Alice that read “Hey, what were your times for Fri/Sat?” *(For context, our timeclock system hasn't been letting me log in for the last month, and she's been having to punch in my times manually. We've tried everything trouble-shoot wise and nothings worked)* Within a few minutes, she double-texted, saying “I'm sorry, let me start over: Good morning Sunshine, will you let me know your times for Friday and Saturday when you get the chance?” I thought it was odd that she would correct herself to make her text sweeter/friendlier rather than distant and semi-professional like the first message was, but I was delighted all the same. 

I also had a date with the casual person ive been seeing that day, which I thought the date went really well (lots of flirting from them, lots of kissing at the end of the date, flirty and receptive texting after). More on this later.

I absolutely love coffee, and would have two coffees a day on average. Sometimes three.

I’ve managed to cut back to maybe one coffee a week, and I’ve tried to tie it to days where I assume I’m not going to feel overly stressed or affected.

Yesterday I had a Starbucks coffee (one shot) at about 3pm. I spent the evening feeling overwhelmed, stressed and just general life anxiety - even waking up this morning, I still felt anxious.

My question is, how likely is this actually caused by the coffee? Or am I assuming it to be related? Can one coffee seriously impact someone so long after the drink?

Im looking for a new grinder and espresso setup, on a 5k budget.

   
Im interested in all your thoughts and opinions, but to give each weight I would like for you to add if and how long you have had the device/devices in use, you are referring too in your comment.  
  
I don’t mind theoretical discussions, a lot of good stuff comes out of this. But its good to know what comments are based on experience, and what are not.  
  
  
Im in the market for an upgrade. In both grinder and espresso machine. For the grinder I have settled on the Option-O Lagom P64 with ssp HU burrs. at 2k, this leaves a 3k budget for the Machine.  
  
I owned a Philos but experienced issues with it, A DF83V is an option, but I think the build quality and workflow are things I dislike about it. i also dont know the 83mm burrs are a blessing or a curse. I rather pay a little bit more for a p64.   
Next to this I own the Zespresso K Ultra handgrinder, which I use for pour over. 

   
I have used an oracle touch(brevile dual boiler) for 3,5 years and have had 2 different machines in that time, Both had issues and got returned. before that i had acces to a Profitec Pro 700 for a month or 2.  
  
Im still researching my next espresso machine, but have narrowed it down. Decent, Bianca v3, drive(p 700) or Pro 800. 

The Decent is the first to be crossed off, because of maintenance(you do it yourself or send it back) and company issues(social media, community lock in). I also don’t like the software lock. I don’t mind the noise, or watertank position as much(is an anooyance). I do like the feedback it could give, but am not sure i would use the machine to its fullest. At somepoint i just want good cappuchino.  
  
  
The bianca and drive are in the same boat, I like the look of the bianca more, wood accents white body. But feel like the drive with the steam joysticks is the better machine in both build quality and experience. If it comes down to these 2, it will become the drive.

   
The Profitech Pro 800, is something that intrigued me recently. I like the way you interact and make your espresso, against the push a button, and fiddle with flow control e61. But im not sure the Pro 800 is capable of creating good espresso on light-medium roast coffee.  
 

I make mostly cappuccino’s with the occasional espresso, all about 1:2/1:3 ratio depending on the bean and roast. And am looking for sweet flavorfull cups. I don’t want to much acidity. Most of this comes from the grinder, hence the ssp hu.  


I feel like the pro 800 will give the subjective better experience, of being involved with the process and making a good espresso. As where the bianca en drive, make good espresso and offer the ability to get a little more involved with the process. 

Im however holdback because I cant find a lot of reviews about lever machines against E61. Is it even possible to get good espresso out of lighter roast beans in a lever machine.   
  
How thermal stable is the pro 800.  
What are the overall cons/pro's of having lever vs e61 flow control.  
  
Prices change where you live, these are an indication of mine.  
Bianca v3 2100  
Drive 2600  
pro 800 3000  
Decent 3400+  
Mini/Micra 4000+

Im intrested in your opinions and experiences, let me know.

The last remaining symptom is chronic, daily bloating/distension. I've been transitioning to carnivore from keto to hopefully and finally heal. I've now been 95% carnivore for 3.5 wks. The 5% non-compliance is due to coffee and I've started the weaning off process. Done this before and better for me than cold turkey. I'm also not reacting well to clean bacon or even aged cheese. So I've stopped those foods and feeling better without. I'm still having my one cup of morning coffee with a beaten raw egg, 1 Tblspn ghee and salt. I've stopped butter, and may need to give up ghee and eggs as well and go Lion. I've switched from chicken to duck eggs to see if that makes a difference.

We are trying to avoid having to buy online like coffeeitalia.it because we will be there for a short time, shipping time would be tricky. Also, we are looking into getting that tax refund money (non-eu passport). 😅 ",4,1732630614.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False

because they P and it’s “just not fair”
I know P comes with its own set of woes and isn’t “fair,” trust, but in my head that’s how it feels. I have a restrictive and pill disorder
but everything that goes in my body on a binge remains there and I “pay for it.” we are not the same in that regard, which is why my binges produce weight gain.
and i’m just tired of seeing them say they P it all, much like i’m tired of seeing all the food wrappers on my coffee table and my own grotesque body.

and yes, i’ve asked two kinds of doctors for help and all i hear is dismissals. they want talk talk therapy to worsen binges from PTSD, to wait for things to get bad like diabetes, htn, cholesterol, and an insurance-covering ozempic bmi. welcome to America.",0,1732630576.0,BingeEatingDisorder,1,0.38,False

1h0cunc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1h0cunc/itchy_throat_from_anxiety/,Itchy throat from Anxiety? ,"Hey all first time posting but I really need to know if this is normal or not. I’m a 31M and About a year ago after a heavy night of drinking (I don’t drink often) I woke up with terrible anxiety and a “itchy” throat the kind that makes you wanna cough. Later that day after a run I had a full blown panic attack and felt a huge lump in my throat and I was short of breath. Luckily by the next day the throat feeling was gone. 

But ever since that day I’ll randomly get that feeling again. I don’t have a sore throat either, my voice is fine and I don’t feel sick. I can eat and drink just fine as well. It’s really annoying cause the feeling is persistent once I notice it. What scared me the most (and caused even more anxiety) was when me and my gf were being intimate and once we finished I literally couldn’t breathe for like 2 seconds after and i got a bad headache afterwards. 

It got to the point that I went to 2 different ENT doctors to get a TSH blood panel cause I was CERTAIN I had some thyroid or respiratory issue but both times the results came back fine. According to the lab results I’m perfectly healthy. I did that plus an X-ray and EKG and again all normal. Eventually my doctor prescribed me Lexapro about a month ago since he said it could be anxiety mixed with a high caffeine diet. Which might be true cause I do drink a decent amount of coffee and coke zeros, and I’ve always been a bit anxious. The Lexapro has helped tremendously with anxiety but the throat feeling comes up still every now and then. I’ve also started a no caffeine diet about 10 days ago now and I’m gonna stick to it since I’ve read up on all the benefits no caffeine has on anxiety.

I work in customer service so I’m talking all day and I do work out 5 times a week for some added context. But again I don’t think it’s a sore throat. Is it really just anxiety? Even being intimate with my partner makes me anxious because of the breathing thing that happened. All from some stupid annoying itchy throat. 

Will this feeling go away if I stick to the Lexapro and commit to no caffeine? I know anxiety can be debilitating but I never expected to result in something like this. Just want to know if anyone else out there experienced anything similar! Any advice will be welcome. ",1,1732630514.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1h0cu29,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenFOAM/comments/1h0cu29/what_is_the_cause_of_the_high_number_of/,What is the cause of the high number of non-orthogonal faces in my mesh?,"While meshing, the number of non-orthogonal faces refuses to go below 1944. A segmentation fault shortly occurs after snappyHexMesh begins the ""Doing final balancing"" phase, meaning I cannot see the mesh and where the non-orthogonal faces are.  
  
I am simulating the flow over a coffee mug in a 2D simulation and the blockMesh has already been set to be 1 layer wide. All of the normals of the coffee mug faces are pointing outwards, and the coffee mug and blockMesh are the same thickness. I have also tried to smooth out the corners of the coffee mug, but that did not affect the number of non-orthogonal faces. The same snappyHexMeshDict in the motorBike case is being used, but I set the maxLocalCells to 10,000 and maxGlobalCells to 100,000. The segmentation fault persists regardless if I use parallel processing or not.

How can I reduce the number of non-orthogonal faces?Is the segmentation fault caused by the high number of non-orthogonal faces?

Thanks for any help!
