I am not at all familiar with the machine, and was hoping someone can give me a breakdown for troubleshooting.

Customer service has been unhelpful since I don’t have a membership and they want me to buy a new replacement. The guy over the phone thinks it is “barcode reading” issue but the head of the machine is quite clean. I don’t suspect any blockages given how well the stream of water was during the clean cycle,

Their large is embarrassingly small, their breakfast sandwiches are about just as small as their large coffees. However, the one thing I do have to give them credit for is at least they've priced everything accordingly, unlike The Bread Pedaler. Their food was far to expensive for how basic it all was. 

I guess what my rant is trying to get across is how are you supposed to stand out from the absolute sea of Cafes in this city if you're going to be that basic 😅. ",0,1734748190.0,lancaster,1,0.43,False

Now, it gets crazy. From the 1st park we walked to the park in the right top corner. The Fi app shows us taking lefts and rights on different streets to the park and entering on the left side of the park when we actually took a different path and street to the park entering in the park on the right. What the heck!! And we also walked around the second park differently than shown by the Fi app.

Is the tracking getting worse for you and making up where you walk? The app has also shown my dog a 1/2 mile behind me when he was actually right next to me.

I am tall woman who wears really high heels. My husband (M5'7) comes from a very short family. I decided my husband should have to climb a ladder in order to use cupboards in the kitchen, as the bottom row of cupboards are so far away from me, they look so tiny,  to use them i need to kneel down and crouch to look inside the tiny cupboards. My husband finds it more convenient and arousing to be inconvenienced by having to climb a ladder to get to the cupboards, as it helps him to feel submissive, he also likes extreme sports so him climbing a ladder to reach the upper set of cupoards without any kind of harness gives him his adrenaline fix.

Well, recently weve had his mother (5'2) staying with us and its been a nightmare, she keeps moving things around the kitchen so she can use them and says its rude to only leve things in the top cupbards so guests cant use them, my husband shut her down saying only ""my Empress's"" convenenience and comfort matters. 

I wanted a coffee and couldnt find a mug and it took me five minutes to find them, she had put them in the lower cupboard! crouching down was so difficult and hurt my back, which made me very snappy and irritable. When I challenged my MiL and she told me it was no big deal and she just wanted to be able to make a coffee without the danger of climbing to get everything.

I decided I had had enough, so I put my foot on her chest and pushed her down to the floor beneath me and held her there under my shoet, rubbing it across her body and face, asking her if she was ready to apologise, when she refused i got rougher, pressing harder and flattening her a little, she cried out and begged me to stop, but i kept going for longer and shoved my big toe in her mouth, which had to stretch to fit it. I asked again for my apology and she gave it, but I told her we werent finished and she had to lick the soles of my shoes clean,  shoving the sharp stilleto heel deep into her mouth.

I asked her for an apology and she said ""Sorry OP"", so i pushed down harder for a bit making her squeel and eased off and said ""Sorry what?"" ""Sorry Empress"" she wimpered.

My husband was delighted by this and has been asking me to retell the story in bed, but some of my friends Sarah (F5'9), Jessica (F5'10) and Siobhan (F6'1) says this all went a bit too far. So, AITA?",3,1734747629.0,AmITheAngel,1,1.0,False

# WHAT TO EXPECT: 

* Send an email, either with all the info filled out or just saying hi! Either is fine, it’ll start a convo! I usually respond that day, unless I’m very busy or my phone isn’t with me for some reason.
* We can work out what you want, I’ll come up with a pricing range, then you pick from that range depending on how much detail you would like, and what your budget is. 
* From there, we will work out a payment plan. Generally, we can split it up between any amount, but I will put you in the queue once half is paid. 
* Once you are in the queue, there may be a little waiting period. Fully depends on how many commissions I have at the time, or if you paid for a rush fee. 
* Once your commissions comes up in the queue, you will receive 3 very simple pose sketches, and pick from those which you like best (minor adjustments can be made) 
* The Updates Section! You will receive a low res screenshot at each of the following stages: 
   * Sketch (Here is the best time to fix any outfit/style changes, or simple fixes) 
   * Cleaned Lineart (if requested) 
   * Flat Colors
   * Shading under lines
   * Full Painted Render 
* At each of those steps small modifications can be made, but any major re-draws may cost extra depending on how far it sets the drawing process back.
* Generally, once I have the lineart/final sketch done, the piece will be ready within the next few days unless you have a rush job, in which case it can be done as soon as THAT day. 
* Once the full piece is okayed, (and the full payment is processed) I will send you the high resolution JPEG for PERSONAL USE, you do not own the rights to the piece, if you wish to purchase the rights, that can be discussed!

1hizw4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1hizw4g/has_everyone_gotten_better_at_this_game/,Has Everyone Gotten Better at This Game?,"The golden sunbeams throughout my RV pierces through the darkness consuming my eyes, forcing me to wake up. Today is another day, so I decide to pour myself a coffee and do my daily morning routine to get ready for the day. I boot up my 2012 Windows 8 laptop, which took a few minutes to get running fully. With coffee in my hand, I open my favorite place to talk to my friends from across the world and to share photos for my love for my white Rabbit. 

I check the server where my friends fawn over my love with me: ""Guys did you see it? Faker won worlds yet again! He got his 5th trophy last night!""

F-Faker...? HOLY SHIT, *that* guy from League of Legends?

Memories played like a trailer in my mind, bringing back ancient relics from the time I used to play League of Legends. I was a huge Faker fan, and it was mind blowing when he had won his third worlds in 2016. I was so inspired by the beast of a man, the humble Unkillable Demon King himself. I wanted to be like him one day, so back in 2016 I used to play a lot of League of Legends on this same laptop, playing mid lane.

I was incredibly good at it too, being at Diamond 1 within a month of playing. Unfortunately, I had to quit because I ended up joining a Special Response Team to train to be a special agent, and it's where I met the love of my life, fun fact. The game was easy; everyone I went against were completely trash, even in Diamond.

And to this day, the GOAT of League is **STILL** winning worlds trophies? I could not believe it! I decided to finally reinstall my favorite game back in the day. It only took me 10 hours with my connection and laptop, but I finally got it booted up.

I hop on a ranked game because that is the only reasonable thing to do after a multiple year hiatus. After a 10 minute loading screen (seriously, why did Riot remove seeing other people's loading bars; I wanted to flame who had the slow computer in my game), we finally get in. Of course, I am playing the big white statue himself in honor of my goat, Galio. 

2 minutes in and I got solo killed by a Zed with teleport over ignite. 

WOW! I was not expecting how good he was in Diamond; maybe he is actually Masters+ somehow playing in my elo because of decay?

I can come back. I saw Faker do the same in this situation even with the entire enemy team being different.

I died.

I died.

I died.

I died.

I died.

I died.

I died.

I died...

I died......

I DIED.........

# I DIED 💢💢😡😡🤬🤬🤬

I flipped my table, thus crushing my laptop into pieces. Red covered my entire body, tears flowed down my face. 

# THIS IS NOT LIKE ME 💢💢💢💢

However, in my unnatural fury, I heard a banging on my door. Five mysterous men entered my home, looking all huge and intimidating. Their relatively massive bodies overshadowed my tiny self. 

Wait, I think I recognize these people, but *how*? How did they become real?

The man with the shadow shurikens and a mask, who had handed my ass to me many times just now

Some weird undead red guy with a mask and two long blades

A fourth king who would not leave my lane all game

A small maniac obsessed with bombs who would make me believe every other minute that I was still drafted in war

And the other person who would not leave me alone, I have no clue why he was in the bottom, but the doctor himself who kept visiting me to throw cleavers all lane

What were they doing here, and why are they all looking at me with red eyes and a face of thirst? 😭😭😭💦💦💦

Red and black quickly flooded my vision.

I look up from the confusion of what had just happened to me:

The golden beams flowing through my room now gone, replaced with nothing but a dark white light.

Almost everything in my house was gone and pillaged away...

The big diamond wedding ring on my finger shattered into four pieces, losing its saturation and turning into a rusty grey color, exposing the fakeness of my ring, actually being made out of iron. The calendar on my wall was torn, showing that today's date was January 12 in the year 2000....but it's November, and how did my calendar show the year 2000 when it is currently 24 years after that? 

And why do I have a weird burning sensation deep inside my behind?

Most importantly, my white Rabbit, the love of my life, my future wife is gone! 😭💢

Yet I wonder, how did these people elos below me play way better than I could've ever fathomed?

the young man watched the snow through the windows.

he wanted to stay in that cafe forever.

1hizlpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/auckland/comments/1hizlpa/new_zealand_is_irrelevant_in_australia/,New Zealand is irrelevant in Australia.,"Growing up in New Zealand, the rivalry with Australia is often portrayed as significant. From sports and food, like the debate over pavlova or coffee to broader cultural comparisons, the idea of Australia and New Zealand being both rivals and best mates is deeply ingrained. Because of this, I assumed New Zealand would hold a prominent place in Australian conversations about diplomacy, education, the job market, and holiday destinations, etc.

However, I and my whole family have realised that New Zealand is frankly irrelevant in these discussions within Australia. There are people here who don’t even recognize the abbreviation “NZ” or know much about the country at all, actually you know when your having a casual talk with a stranger, we've met a few who didn't even know what NZ was. While Australia is frequently mentioned in New Zealand schools, the reverse isn’t true. My younger brother’s primary school, for example, don't really mention New Zealand.

Australians tend to focus more on their relationships with Asian countries such as India, China, Sri Lanka, Korea and African countries like Somalia, Ethiopia, South Sudan, when discussing matters I mentioned before. Aside from the occasional mention of Queenstown, New Zealand simply doesn’t seem to feature prominently in Australian life.

Also I thought that Auckland was at least ""bigger"" than Brisbane and Adelaide in terms of being an economic powerhouse, or population wise. I was wrong about that as well. It's moreso equal with Adelaide, and is smaller than Brisbane in many regards. 

This could just be me though, I mean Kiwi immigrants are still a decently sized population here. I've heard a lot of them live in Brisbane, which makes sense because I would also hear of kids going to Gold Coast for a trip over the school holidays etc.

**I moved to Melbourne from Auckland so perhaps that could influence my view**.

And then before she left I asked to add her on Instagram, and she said Ill add you later and then she did.

My thoughts at that time was, shes traveling, so nothing can ever happen, so I left feeling proud of talking to her after walking off.  The next day, I asked many of my coworkers about this event and they said, I missed an opportunity, they said, she wanted to have a drink with you, and to take her to the airport, they say that you gotta read between the lines, also they said she cute on her insta. Knowing that I felt so bad. Then I checked my Instagram and she unfollowed me but I remain a follower on her insta.  I know yall mad at me but Im still new to this and I didn't know sorry. >.< This meeting happened early in November , now its the end of December and lasted only for 6 minutes, now Ill remember this for all eternity! 

Should I message her and say happy holidays?  What If i message and she blocks me....plz halp! After that, I tried going out again every weekend, and nothing has happened, just endless rejections, making friends sometimes and yapping with strangers, the cougars seems easy because they cougars and i avoid them yuk, I guess its a rare thing for it to occur. Anyways your thoughts. Thank you for your advice and happy holidays! ♡",1,1734746181.0,dating_advice,2,0.67,False
1hiziqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ioniq5/comments/1hiziqe/first_long_snowstorm_drive/,First long snowstorm drive.,"Just did my first long drive in a snowstorm and decent cold, plus new snow tires. I am pretty impressed! I was expecting worse oerfomamce due to the cold, snowy roads, and snow tires.

215km drive, all rolling hills and a small 100m increase in total elevation from start to finish. Snow covered to track bare roads, falling snow the whole time, -9°C, and brand new Nokian R5’s on 18” steel rims with no covers. Total drive was 2h50m including about 30 minutes of stops for dinner and coffee. Kept the car at 22°c with defrost and foot heat, heated seats on, after warming up climate ran at a fairly steady 1.6kwh, averaged around 95km/h for the drive. Ended up getting 21kwh/100km! I was shocked, I thought it would be closer to 24-25 but this car keeps exceeding my expectations. 

It also handles amazingly in snow with snow tires and in snow mode, although I feel the abs is a little sensitive, it never feels like it’s getting in the way. It’s also amazing how you don’t really feel the weight of the car in the snow.",6,1734746026.0,Ioniq5,0,1.0,False

1hizgdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbook/comments/1hizgdk/which_macbook_for_laid_back_use/,Which MacBook for .. laid back use?,"My MacBook is the M1 Air and I've been very happy with it. Even though I'm primarily a Windows user. The M1A is super fast (for my needs - including programming), lightweight, good battery life, etc. I also have the 512Gb storage / 16 Gb memory variant and I think it was quite a solid choice to chose those specs. There is just one problem - the screen is a bit small.

I could always connect it to an external display, but.. that's what my Windows laptop setup is for. To me, the MacBook is a lightweight, convenient device that I can actually use on my lap, without worrying about it overheating. As a matter of fact, I am typing this out on my M1A, while am lying in bed, on my back, with the M1A perched up against my knees. It is surprisingly comfortable and is one of my favorite uses of this device. Maybe you guys will laugh at this, but I'm just being honest. I also like to use it in a coffee shop, though not that frequently. I've even used it on an airplane a number of times. It's so compact that I have no problem using it on a plane's lunch tray, nor a problem with packing it alongside my oversized windows laptop (mentioned below) - in the *same* backpack.

At the same time, the M1A's small screen is quite a problem. It's perfectly fine for most light use, such as web browsing, YouTube, Notion, and various types of other note-taking (e.g. SublimeText). But when it comes to programming, it's just a bit small. One of the big problems, in my view, is that the bezels on the M1A are just way too thick.

I was thus, trying to decide, if it's worthwhile to upgrade to a device with a bigger screen. My Windows laptop (XPS 17 9710) has a 17"" display (with the world's thinnest bezels and a resolution that is greater than even 4k) and I love that thing to death. But it draws a lot of power and heats up easily, so I have it on a laptop stand, with an external keyboard + mouse, and usually connected to an external display(s). So the XPS 17 already covers the 'large display' category more than sufficiently.

However, if I want to use a laptop.. on my lap.. or on my knees, while I'm lying down, if I'm to use a MacBook, the M1A largely limits me to that more light use. I can do programming on it, but I'm just overly constrained when it comes to how much information I can see on the screen at once. I was therefore thinking about one of the following:

* MBA 15"" with the M3 chip & 512Gb storage (256 is just too low bc the OS + core apps eat probably half of that). That totals around $1500 before taxes. But at this price point, a MB Pro becomes quite compelling. Also, 15"" might be a tad bit too large to use on an airplane (which, I honestly, is an infrequent type of use for me) or to use in bed. Or not.. you guys tell me. Would love to hear your personal experiences on this.

* MB Pro M4 with 14"" display
  * This display is slightly bigger than the M1A's, but with much smaller bezels iirc. Those 2 factors could combine for giving a good amount of additional, noticeable, screen real estate.
  * CPU: Given that even the M1A's CPU is fast enough for my needs, I definitely don't need the higher tier CPUs. At the same time, does being refurbished make sense when MacBooks retain value so well and the price difference might be just a couple hundred USD?
  * ""Nano Texture"" - this could be a game-changer. Reflective displays are a huge problem in an env with any decent amount of lighting. +$150 to the cost.
  * 24GB of memory - this contradicts what I said earlier about not needing ""more power"". Although I don’t usually need it, more memory would enhance ML workloads, which benefit significantly from additional memory. But I also don't have a need to run ML workloads - would just be fun to play around with them.
With the Nano Texture display + 24 GB of memory, I would be looking at $2150, plus tax.

Overall, my thoughts are that I've fallen for Apple's marketing and just want an even nicer, newer thing that I don't actually need. At $2150 + tax (but minus some trade-in value for the M1A), I would be spending a couple thousand USD for something that I imagine will make me want to use a MacBook a lot more and will make me a lot more productive. But in reality, it's probably a small improvement, at a high price and is just a poor use of $.

I hope I didn't rant too much. I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you.",0,1734745795.0,macbook,4,0.33,False

Came out of anesthesia pretty completely by 12:30ish. Drank my weight in water and apple juice immediately (whatever they give you to dry your mouth out was terrible!). I got very lucky and didn't experience even a hint of nausea, and I was absolutely starving. Ate turkey breast, mashed potatoes and broccoli. Finally had coffee, which may have been the highlight. 

They kept a little bit of a closer eye on me at first because the anesthesia caused some bradycardia.  I was bouncing between 40 and 50bpm for awhile, but once it started trending up and not bouncing back down they were no longer concerned. Finally got released at 5pm. 

Took the worst nap when I got home, and now I'm drinking peppermint tea and eating soup. Nothing hurts too bad, I just have a general soreness in my abdomen, sometimes a sharp pain from what I assume is gas (lots of discomfort around my clavicle), and every once in awhile a hollow cramping feeling where my gallbladder was.

Overall I feel much better than I thought I would, and it wasn't as terrifying as I convinced myself. Overall I am very happy I went ahead with surgery, I'm greatly looking forward to never experiencing a gallbladder attack ever again.

# AITAH for how I reacted when my niece announced she was engaged?

I (33m) have a pretty big age difference with my brother (44m). He had a child at 25, which means that I became an uncle at 14. Because we were pretty close in age, I formed a special bond with my niece, Ella (now 18f).

When she was 16, my brother and his family moved away so I've been seeing them less recently, but we keep in touch and catch up at family events.

Last year, at Christmas, my niece told me that she had a boyfriend and told me a bit about him, but I didn't know the guy. He was invited for Easter and a couple of other events, but was never able to make it. When we were planning our mother's birthday, my brother decided to invite Ella's boyfriend so that we could all meet him.

Yesterday was the birthday. I was looking forward to meeting Mark (Ella's boyfriend), but was very confused when I saw her walk in with a man that looked double her age (spoiler alert: he is). She introduced him to me, and I politely smiled but was deep down very concerned. I went to my brother to ask how old Mark was and he told me that Mark is 36, so literally double Ella's age. She had told me that he was ""a bit older"" but I assumed like early to mid twenties, not almost 40. That's when they called us in the living room to share ""exciting news"". Ella showed us a ring and revealed that they were engaged.

I just said ""what the fuck"" and everyone turned around and looked at me like I was crazy. I told them that they were out of their minds if they thought this was normal, that there was no world in which a 30 something should date an 18yo, and that she shouldn't be getting married. All of them accused me of ruining Ella's happiness. Some even said that I was jealous of Mark, which is so fucking disgusting I can't even explain it. I mean, I'm younger than Mark, but never in a million years would I ever consider dating someone younger than 25. They told me that it was perfectly legal as they were both adults, which isn't true because they've been dating for a year and Ella turned 18 7 months ago, and that if they were happy that's all that matters.

I told them that they were sick for allowing this and that he was a predator but they wouldn't listen. I know this isn't my business, but I can't help but fear for Ella. She is young and doesn't really know what she's getting into. I'm really scared of her getting married and being unable to leave him when she realizes how sick it was. I then left and slammed the door, and have been receiving pretty wild messages and calls since then. I don't know if I was wrong for this and am just overreacting, and if I wasn't wrong I don't know what I can do to make them realize how wrong it is. AITAH?

# [RELEVANT COMMENTS]

>**RepresentativeGur250**

>NTA but teens will double down about the whole thing if you react negatively, generally speaking.

>Can you do some digging into this guy’s background? Has he ever been married, who are his friends, what does he do for a living, find out stuff about his ex’s. Check if any info comes up about him for any of the laws named for victims of domestic violence, abuse, etc. I think it’s likely you’d find something dodgy there. No decent man of that age would date an 18 year old. I’m a bit older than him and if any of my guy friends brought an 18 year old to something as his date, I’d be telling them exactly how creepy it is.

>Did your family say all of that in front of your niece? If it was, they could well be playing a long game, giving their ‘approval’ and hoping your niece will get over the initial thrill of dating a much older guy and that it will fizzle out. Or pretending so that she doesn’t push them away and cut them off, so they can keep an eye on the situation and help her if it goes south. Talk to a few in private, especially your brother. Maybe they do feel exactly the same way as you do but they have a plan. And if you do find sketchy things if you look into him, tactfully share them with her parents. Don’t go in guns blazing.

**OOP**: I quickly went over his facebook account so it’s not really verified info, but I saw pictures of him with his ex (I think?) and she looked 20-24 maybe? It’s still better but if the guy has a thing for younger girls that’s even more wrong. And it seems like he was still with his ex when he started dating my niece, so even weirder… 

>**No\_Addition\_5543**

>Is he rich?

**OOP**: Not that I know of. I know it doesn’t mean anything but he doesn’t look rich. And I’ve seen pictures of his house, it’s pretty normal. I’d say middle class, upper middle class at best. 

>**lizeken**

>OP how did they even meet? I mean I had some weird friends in their 20s as a teen because I grew up in a small town, but late 30s is absurd

**OOP**: Through sports apparently. My niece does tennis and so does he, in the same club and they met during a tournament (at least that’s what she told me the first time she told me she had a boyfriend)

>**ReginaldDwight**

>Was he her coach?

**OOP**: No I don’t think so. From what I understood, Ella was in a tournament in her club and she played against adults, she played against Mark and after he came to talk to her so they talked and that was basically it 

>**NHFNCFRE**

>Info: is there a religious or cultural expectation that would make this more acceptable to your family? I personally think it's gross, but I'm some areas and religions it's almost expected.

**OOP**: No, or at least not in my family. Some of them are vaguely Christian, but somewhat traditional, not anything weird that would explain enabling this relationship. But my niece and I are atheists (as far as I know)

>**TNJDude**

>How old was Ella when they started dating? People are assuming she was 17 when they started, though it's possible she was 18 since it's less than a year since she announced they were dating. If she was 17, I'd have serious concerns. I'd have those concerns if she was 18, but she'd have been an adult at the time and it would have been up to her. Since she IS an adult now and is capable of making her own decisions as to who to date, I have to go with YTA. It would be understandable to have concerns. It'd be understandable to talk to your brother and niece about your concerns. You could have talked to them about all of your concerns, but you didn't. You shouted and demanded and insulted all of them and slammed the door and even now have the attitude that they all need to do what you tell them with no discussion.

**OOP**: She announced they were dating last Christmas, so 11 months ago. She turned 18 7 months ago. She was 17 when she told me, and she said they had been dating a few months (like 3 or 4 I can’t remember). So she was around 17 and 4 or 5 months

>**versatiledork**

>I find it weird how you only just found out about all these details. Meeting him in person, his true age...is there any chance she was worried you'd think this way & tried to hide it from you? You just sound like a caring uncle looking out for their niece.

**OOP**: I’m not sure she was worried, but I think there’s a chance that that’s the reason why he was never able to make it when he was invited to a family gathering…

Tell her you trust her to put herself first and you are always there for her. This is important.

>If you think the relationships overlapped, check for him on dating apps. He could still be trolling around for young women. If you do find him on one, don’t instantly show it. He could try and explain it away by saying it’s an old profile. You could potentially try and catfish him so there is more evidence, but I don’t know if that would have any legal ramifications where you are. Getting a screen shot with a current date showing he’s online in the app would be good, but might be difficult.

>Definitely run his details through Clare’s law and Sarah’s law or any similar/equivalent things in your country.

>Obviously there isn’t a guarantee you’d find anything incriminating, but if you’ve found pictures of him with other young women, it’s likely he’s a massive creep. Although he can still be a creep but be legally fine. But I still highly recommend quietly digging into him and his past as much as possible.

>I know some may think it’s an over reaction and intrusive, but honestly I’d rather do that and hope to find something rather than just letting it go.

# [UPDATE #1 - 1 DAY LATER]

So I've taken the past 24h to really reflect on all of this, I tried to take in most of the advice in the comments, and here's what I have decided. I don't think that me telling her and everyone that the relationship is weird was wrong, I do however think that I did it wrong and it was pretty harsh because it was in the heat of the moment. But I still find this very creepy and don't think she should get married.

What I've decided to do is:

1. Apologize to her. I sent her a text saying I was sorry for my outburst and that I should've thought it through beforehand. I told her that I never wanted to make her feel like I didn't want her to be happy, and that I loved her very much and had her best interests in mind.
2. Ask her if we could talk about this. I asked if she would be okay and free to hang out and maybe get coffee this week to talk about all of this with a clear head. I really want to try and get her to see why it's weird and that maybe marrying him is not a great choice.
3. Explain myself to my brother. I sent him a text saying that I was sorry for the way I said it, but that I still thought that it needed to be said. I explained to him why I think Mark is a predator and this relationship could have a very negative and damaging impact on Ella.

I'm still waiting on their replies. I'll update when they reply, or when I see Ella (if she accepts), depending on how long it would take.

In the meantime, I really want to thank everyone who gave me advice and was constructive, and really tried to help my niece out of this situation. I also send my best to all of the people in the comments sharing similar stories when they were the teenager getting groomed. I'm so sorry this happened to you and I really hope you're doing better now.

**OOP**: Yeah, my friends and I are currently going through his socials. We’ve done facebook already and found his last ex was around 20-24 and their relationship overlapped with his relationship with my niece… 

We’ve also made multiple fake accounts on dating apps, as 18-22yo to see if he has a profile on there and if so, if he would also go for a younger girl. 

# [UPDATE #2 - 4 days of the Original Post]

So, following my text (see last post), Ella replied and told me she agreed to meet with me and talk. I just came back from seeing her.

Here's how it went. She asked me what I wanted to tell her and I started explaining that I didn't think her relationship was very healthy, and that no older guy should want to date a teenager. I told her that she was an incredible woman so I wasn't saying it was weird that someone would want to marry her, but that guys my age normally shouldn't even look at a teenager. She wasn't convinced and said that sometimes it's true but sometimes it's okay. I asked her how she would feel if I told her that someone born today could be her future partner, and she said it felt really weird. I also asked her if she would consider dating someone younger than 15, and she said no.

I could see her starting to realize that Mark maybe didnt have the best intentions. I also asked her if she knew about his previous relationship, and she said ""vaguely"" and just told me the girl's name. I asked her if she knew how old the girl was and she said she was 21. I also asked her if she knew that their relationships overlapped and she said that Mark always told her he was single since they met, but she kind of felt like that wasn't true. I told her that since his previous girlfriend was also significantly younger it seemed like he had a thing for younger girls, which is kind of weird.

After discussing that, she told me a bit more about her relationship. She told me she was starting to feel weird about it because of Mark's recent behavior. I asked what she meant and she said that he had been flirting with a lot of girls, who were all also younger, including some of Ella's friends. When she confronted him he sort of gaslit her into thinking it wasn't flirting. He was also making a lot of comments about having children with Ella and how cute it would be to see her raise them. She told me she was absolutely not ready for that and also wanted to go to college and work and not be a SAHM. Because of all of that she was doubting her relationship and I told her that I understood.

She said she was scared of breaking up with him because he had become her whole life recently and she didn't know what she would do without him. I told her that she was surrounded by people who loved her and would be there for her, and that she was a lot more than just Mark's girlfriend. I said that she knew my opinion on it, but that ultimately the choice was hers, and that I just wanted her to be happy. I also said I would be there for her no matter what. She told me that she will try to break up with him this week, and she'll let me know how it goes. I'll edit this post if I have more info.

Also, again, thank you to everyone who gave advice and tried to help us. I really appreciate it.

Edit: Okay so I just want to say, some people in the comments seem to think that this is fake, and you know what, I can understand. And I don't really care, I'm not asking you to believe that my life is real or fake, and it's great that you don't just believe everything you see online. But I just want to say this: there are hundreds of people on here or elsewhere that share similar stories. I'm not really affected by people thinking I'm lying, mainly because I'm not the one in that situation. But some people might be. Some people come on here to share something that might have traumatized them, and the last thing they want is for others to think they're lying. So if you don't want to believe me that's fine, but the next time keep that to yourself. It's fine to not believe something, but you don't have to say it, because it might make other people feel really bad.

# [RELEVANT COMMENTS OF THE 2ND UPDATE]

>**gmnitsua**

>Were you aware that the guy's previous relationship overlapped? I'm confused by the wording there.

**OOP**: To explain this in more details: 

I went through the guy’s socials with my friends a few days ago because we thought there might be other weird things going on and we ended up finding info about his previous relationship (the one right before Ella). 

So Ella told me at Christmas (so december 24th) that they had been dating for “a few months”, but when we searched his Facebook we saw a post wishing happy birthday to a girl who he called his “baby” on December 12th. And this girl appeared in other posts where they were kissing or he was calling her pet names so we assumed she was his gf. Which Ella confirmed afterwards.

And this girl also looked very young. He at one point wrote something about her and said “as soon as you’re done with college”, so we knew she was in college. And she looked between 20 and 25. And Ella then confirmed that she was 21. 

But yeah basically it seemed like he was still with his ex while dating Ella, so I asked her if she knew about that.

>**turBo246**

>It's interesting that in the first paragraph, Ella wasn't convinced, saying, ""Sometimes that's true, but sometimes it's ok.""

>In the next paragraph, she's telling you about the things that Mark has done that make her feel weird about the relationship.

>And ALL IT TOOK was you, her uncle, to say, ""Would you date a person that was born today?"", to make her realize that the 18-year age gap is weird....

>I was convinced the story was real until this update. 🙄 I can't wait to learn what your brother has to say!!

>Updateme

**OOP**: No, basically I was telling her that it was weird for him to date her and she was telling me that she understood that older men dating younger girls can be creepy as a whole, but sometimes it’s just because they’re in love. 

Then I talked for a while about how men our age normally perceive 18yo as literal children, so they don’t go after them unless they’re actually okay with dating children. And when I asked her that question it really hit her and she admitted that maybe it was actually weird. 

And then she talked about all the red flags, but it was kind of unrelated. I think it’s the addition of both of these things that made her really come to the realization that the relationship was a bit weird. 

But what I didn’t say in the post is, this took a really long time. We talked for over 3 hours and what I posted is just a really big summary of all we said. I just tried to keep it short but it wasn’t as quick as it seems to be. 

>**Puppet007**

>But since her family was so accepting of her relationship with Mark when she announced their engagement, they’ll either go after her saying she let go “such a great guy” and/or you for “putting your nose in where it didn’t belong”.

>Your niece is going to need all the support she can get to break away from him.

**OOP**: Yeah, I’m pretty sure if she ends up breaking up with him (which I hope) her dad will blame me for it… Which is the last thing she’ll need if she manages to get out of that relationship 

>**Pippet\_4**

>Take all the blame. Let them redirect any BS at you and not her. Your brother is an absolute failure as a parent. If it were me I’d not care one bit if he was mad at me as long as he leaves his daughter alone.

>You are a good man. Keep being there for your niece. Hopefully she gets away from that creep asap… but even if not, hope she gets there eventually.

>As a woman I wish I could tell her all about how this POS will ruin her life and how to see through his bullshit… but that is why he went after a child, so he can manipulate someone who cannot see him for what he is easily. There are so many women who could share their stories. It sucks to feel helpless to stop this. Like watching a kid chase a ball into the road who doesn’t see a car coming. But all you can do is exactly what you have already done, and continue to be there for her.

**OOP**: I will gladly take the blame, but I’m just scared she’ll feel guilty about it and blame herself if she sees that her dad is mad at me. She’s a very empathetic kid, which is a really great quality, but sometimes she hurts herself because of it…

# [UPDATE #3 - 1 month after the Original Post]

I know it's been a while since I posted the last update and a lot of people have been requesting updates on the whole situation, but until now I hadn't really received any news. So please forgive me if this update took a while to come.

Since my conversation with Ella, I would check in on her once or twice a week and ask how things were and she'd always tell me pretty much the same as what she told me a month ago. Basically, there were many red flags and she was getting more and more uncomfortable in her relationship but she also didn't know how to break up with him. I tried to give her some advice but eventually told her that I thought she should do it when she felt comfortable.

Yesterday I called her to know what she had planned on Christmas and if she'd be coming to the Christmas dinner that I was hosting, and if Mark would be coming. That's when she told me that she had broken up with him the evening before. She was pretty shaken up so I didn't ask for too much detail and asked if she wanted to come to my house for a while. She said that Mark had left to stay with his family when she told him, so she was okay staying home.

This is maybe not a very detailed update but here's what I know. She told me that he had been getting angry at her all week for small things. And then they were talking about Christmas and he insisted that they shouldn't go with Ella's family and instead spend a week with his family because they see them less often (they live out of state). And after that he made a comment about how he hoped that the next year as a present they could give his mother a grandchild, and Ella said that's what really made her break up with him. And she also told me that she would be coming alone for Christmas.

I don't know what she told him or how he reacted, and maybe she'll tell me more in a while when she feels better, and if not I won't ask her to. If I get more information I'll edit this post but for now that's it. Again, thank you to anyone who gave advice and tried to help with this situation.

***TL;DR - OOP's 18 year old niece (Ella) introduced her 36 year old boyfriend (Mark) in a family gathering and they announced their engagement. Everyone of the family congratulated the couple, except OOP who strongly opposed and he calls Mark a creepy and a predator for that. OOP got berated by his family for that. Later he talks to Ella and she confides to OOP that she saw some redflags in Mark like him flirting with some of her friends and pressuring her to be pregnant. Fortunately, Ella broke up with Mark.***",84,1734745427.0,BORUpdates,10,0.96,False

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Water plays a vital role in your body's health, and knowing how much water to consume each day is crucial for maintaining proper hydration. It’s not just about quenching your thirst; understanding the right amount can significantly impact your overall well-being. When you grasp how much water you should consume daily, you can enjoy various benefits that enhance your health and energy levels.

First, let's consider the basic function of water in your body. Every cell in your body needs water to function correctly. Water aids in digestion, helps regulate body temperature, and keeps your joints lubricated. When you're well-hydrated, you can perform basic activities with more ease, giving you energy to tackle your day-to-day tasks.

Staying properly hydrated is essential for:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Energy Levels:** Dehydration can lead to fatigue and sluggishness. When you drink enough water, you maintain your energy levels throughout the day, helping you stay alert and productive.
- **Cognitive Function:** Your brain relies heavily on hydration. Studies have shown that even mild dehydration can affect mood and memory. By drinking enough water, you can boost your concentration and cognitive performance.
- **Digestion:** Water helps break down the food you eat, allowing your body to absorb essential nutrients. It also assists in preventing constipation. Consuming sufficient water daily can support your digestive health significantly.
- **Skin Health:** Hydration leads to better skin elasticity, keeping your skin looking fresh and vibrant. Adequate water intake can help reduce dryness and promote a clear complexion.
- **Weight Management:** Water can act as a natural appetite suppressant. Sometimes, we mistake thirst for hunger. By drinking enough water, you may reduce unnecessary snacking, supporting your weight management goals.
- **Detoxification:** Your kidneys require water to filter toxins from your blood effectively. Sufficient daily water intake helps your body eliminate waste, promoting kidney health.
- **Muscle Function:** When you’re dehydrated, your muscles tend to cramp or become fatigued more easily. Keep your muscles hydrated for better performance during physical activities.
- **Temperature Regulation:** Sweating is one of your body's ways of maintaining a stable temperature. Adequate water consumption helps ensure your body can regulate its temperature effectively.
- **Joint Health:** Synovial fluid, which lubricates your joints, is primarily made of water. Staying hydrated can help keep your joints functioning smoothly, reducing the risk of joint pain.
- **Improved Mood:** Studies show that even slight dehydration can negatively impact mood. Adequate water intake can help you maintain a positive state of mind.

Now that you know why understanding daily water intake is essential for a healthier life, it’s important to recognize how much water you should be consuming. The general rule of thumb is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, often referred to as the “8x8” rule. However, individual needs can vary based on multiple factors such as age, gender, weight, climate, and activity level. Here are some guidelines to help you determine how much water you need:

- **Body Weight:** A common recommendation is to drink half your body weight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, aim for about 80 ounces of water daily.
- **Activity Level:** If you're physically active or exercise regularly, you may need to increase your water intake to compensate for fluid loss through sweat.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather can lead to increased sweating, which means you'll need more water to stay hydrated. Adjust your intake accordingly.
- **Health Conditions:** Certain medical conditions, like fever or urinary tract infections, may require higher water intake. Always consult with a healthcare professional about your specific needs.

When you prioritize understanding how much water to consume daily, your body will reward you with improved health, better mental clarity, and a more vibrant lifestyle. So, make an effort to drink water regularly, carry a water bottle with you, and set reminders if necessary. Your body will thank you!

Staying hydrated can boost your energy levels. Dehydration can cause fatigue and lethargy. By drinking enough water throughout the day, you can maintain optimal energy, enhancing your productivity and overall well-being.

### Improves Cognitive Function

Did you know that your brain is around 75% water? This fact illustrates how hydration impacts cognitive function. Sufficient water intake can improve focus, memory, and overall mental clarity. When you feel sluggish or unfocused, a glass of water might provide the quick boost you need.

By being mindful of your hydration needs, you can significantly improve your overall well-being. Remember to listen to your body and stay consistently hydrated to enjoy a healthier life.

Common Myths About Daily Water Intake
-------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is crucial for your overall health, but various myths surrounding daily water intake can confuse you. Understanding what’s true and what’s not can help you make better choices. Here are some common myths about daily water intake that you should be aware of.

### Myth 1: You Need Eight Glasses of Water a Day

Many people believe that everyone should drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day, known as the “8x8 rule.” However, water needs vary based on factors such as age, gender, activity level, and climate. Some individuals might require more or less than this average. It's essential to listen to your body and drink when you feel thirsty.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 2: You Can Rely Solely on Thirst

While thirst is a good indicator of when you need to drink water, it shouldn't be your only guide. Sometimes, by the time you feel thirsty, your body may already be slightly dehydrated. Paying attention to urine color can be a helpful way to gauge hydration. Pale yellow indicates good hydration, while dark yellow suggests you need more fluids.

### Myth 3: All Fluids Are Equal

Another widespread misconception is that all beverages count toward your daily water intake equally. While it’s true that drinks like tea and coffee contribute to hydration, sugary drinks and alcohol can lead to dehydration. For optimal hydration, prioritize water and limit beverages high in sugar or caffeine.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 4: You Don’t Need Water When Exercising

Some people believe they don’t need to drink water during physical activity. This is far from the truth! Staying hydrated before, during, and after exercise is vital. Water helps regulate your body temperature and lubricate your joints, which can enhance performance and prevent injury.

### Myth 5: Drinking Water Helps You Lose Weight

Many claim that drinking water can miraculously help you lose weight. While staying adequately hydrated can curb hunger and help with digestion, it is not a magic weight-loss solution. Combining hydration with a balanced diet and regular exercise is crucial for any successful weight-loss strategy.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 6: You Can’t Drink Too Much Water

Excessive water intake can lead to a rare but serious condition called water intoxication or hyponatremia. This occurs when the balance of electrolytes in your body gets disrupted due to dilution, causing symptoms like nausea, headache, and in severe cases, can even be life-threatening. Moderation is key!

### Myth 7: You Only Need Water in Hot Weather

It’s a common belief that you only need to drink water during hot weather. Although it's essential to stay hydrated on hot days, your body requires fluids year-round. Factors like indoor heating and air conditioning can also lead to dehydration. Ensure you’re drinking enough water regardless of the season.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 8: Foods Don’t Count Toward Hydration

Many people overlook the fact that food contributes to hydration as well. Fruits and vegetables, such as watermelon, cucumbers, and oranges, have high water content and can help keep you hydrated. these foods into your diet can support your daily water intake.

### Myth 9: Drinking Cold Water is Bad for You

Some believe that drinking cold water slows down digestion or is bad for your health. However, research shows no significant impact on digestion temperature aside from personal preference. Whether you drink water cold, warm, or at room temperature should depend on what feels best for you.

### Myth 10: Older Adults Don’t Need as Much Water

Age does not exempt individuals from the need for adequate hydration. In fact, older adults may have a diminished thirst response, making it crucial for them to consciously monitor their water intake. Ensuring that older adults stay hydrated can greatly impact their health and well-being.

Understanding these myths can help you stay on track with your hydration goals. Remember, your individual needs may vary, so make sure to adjust your water intake based on your lifestyle, exercise, and climate conditions.

How Hydration Affects Your Energy Levels and Focus

Staying hydrated is more than just quenching your thirst; it's vital for maintaining your energy levels and enhancing your focus throughout the day. Water plays a critical role in almost every bodily function, and understanding its impact can lead to significant improvements in your daily productivity and overall health.

When you think of energy, your mind might jump to food and sleep. But let's not forget hydration's role in the energy equation. Here’s how staying properly hydrated can boost your energy and sharpen your focus:

### Increased Energy Levels

Water is essential for the transportation of nutrients in your body. When you are well-hydrated, your blood volume increases, allowing your heart to pump oxygen and nutrients to your muscles and organs more efficiently. This leads to:

Your brain is highly sensitive to changes in hydration levels. Feeling foggy? It could be due to not drinking enough water. Hydration helps maintain essential brain functions like:

- **Concentration:** Proper hydration means increased focus. Studies show that being even slightly dehydrated can impair your attention span, making it harder to concentrate on tasks.
- **Memory Support:** Drinking enough water is linked to sharper memory. Remembering details or retaining information can become increasingly difficult if you are dehydrated.

### Emotional Stability

Your mood can also fluctuate based on your hydration levels. Have you ever noticed you're crankier when you're thirsty? Water helps regulate mood and can prevent feelings of anxiety and irritability. Staying hydrated can lead to:

### Recommended Hydration Practices

To maximize your hydration and its benefits on energy and focus, consider the following tips:

- **Drink Water Regularly:** Aim for at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, but adjust this amount based on your activity level and body size.
- **Keep Water Nearby:** Having a water bottle within reach serves as a reminder to drink throughout the day.
- **Eat Water-Rich Foods:** Incorporate fruits and vegetables like cucumbers, oranges, and watermelon into your diet for additional hydration.

Simple Ways to Track and Increase Your Water Consumption
--------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is vital for your health. Tracking and increasing your water consumption can be quite simple with a few easy strategies. Here are some practical tips to help you stay on top of your daily water intake.

### Know Your Daily Requirement

First, it’s essential to figure out how much water you should consume daily. While the classic “eight glasses a day” rule is popular, individual needs can vary based on factors such as age, weight, and activity level. A good starting point is to aim for half your body weight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, aim for about 80 ounces of water a day.

### Use a Water Bottle with Measurements

Invest in a reusable water bottle that has measurement markers. This will make it easier for you to keep track of how much you've consumed throughout the day. Some bottles even have time markers that remind you how much you should drink by specific times, making it all the more engaging.

### Set Reminders

Utilizing technology can be a great help. Set reminders on your phone or use an app dedicated to tracking water intake. Every hour or two, receive a friendly nudge to take a sip. By integrating this into your daily routine, drinking water will become a habit.

### Drink Before Meals

This simple trick not only increases your water intake but can also help with digestion. Drinking a glass of water 30 minutes before a meal can prepare your stomach and keep you hydrated at the same time. Plus, it can help you feel fuller, which might reduce overeating.

### Flavor It Up

If plain water doesn't excite you, consider adding flavors! Slice some fruits like lemons, limes, or berries and toss them into your water. Fresh herbs like mint can also add a refreshing twist. This not only makes drinking water enjoyable but also provides vitamins and minerals.

### Track Your Progress

Another effective method to increase your water intake is to monitor your progress throughout the day. You can use a journal, spreadsheet, or an app that allows you to log your daily consumption. This awareness encourages you to drink more as you see how much you’ve consumed and how much you still need to drink.

### Pair Water with Activities

Pairing hydration with specific activities can also help remind you to drink. For instance, drink one glass of water every time you sit down at your desk or after every bathroom break. This connection will help you associate specific actions with drinking water, making it easier to keep track.

### Join a Challenge

If you're motivated by community, consider joining a hydration challenge with friends or colleagues. Set a group goal for water intake and share your progress. Friendly competition can be a fun way to hold each other accountable and motivate one another to reach daily water goals.

### Hydrate with Food

Don’t forget that you can also consume fluids through food. Many fruits and vegetables are high in water content, such as cucumbers, watermelon, oranges, and lettuce. these into your meals can help you meet your hydration goals while adding essential nutrients.

- Cucumbers: Over 95% water content.
- Strawberries: About 91% water.
- Celery: Contains 95% water.
- Watermelon: Named for its high water content, at about 92%.

### Stay Consistent

Consistency is key in achieving your hydration goals. Try setting a specific goal and gradually increasing your water intake. Make it a point to drink a certain amount each week and adjust based on your body’s needs. Over time, this will become a natural part of your routine.

### Listen to Your Body

Listen to your body. Pay attention to your thirst cues, and remember that other factors like humidity, physical activity, and altitude can influence your hydration needs. If you feel thirsty, it’s already a sign that you may need to drink more water.

Tracking and increasing your water consumption doesn't have to be a chore. With these simple strategies, you can ensure that you're meeting your daily hydration needs effectively. Remember, staying hydrated is not just about drinking water; it’s about maintaining overall well-being. Make hydration a priority, and you’ll feel the benefits in no time!

I saw a rheumatologist today, due to having some skin rashes/eye swelling that we suspect is due to cross contamination. 

He was giving me tips on managing eating out, and was saying things like “you can’t even drink a coffee inside of a bakery” and “bring your own wine glass to restaurants” because of the gluten particles in the sponges when they wash the dishware/glassware. But if that’s the case, does that mean I should bring my own plate/bowl/utensils, as well ? I can’t imagine myself doing this. 

I know I need to be more strict about cross contamination, and perhaps being inside of a bakery is definitely too much (I understand all the flour floating around can get coated on things), but does this mean I should avoid a pizzeria that also offers salads ? I did just this the other day with friends. He made it seem basically like I could not walk into any restaurant or eat anything that is in the same vicinity as gluten-containing food. 

Which I get - anytime you eat out it’s a risk because you don’t know what is going on behind the scenes in the kitchen..

But am I wrong for thinking this is a bit much ? I’m getting so down on these restrictions. I know no one is putting a gun to my head and telling me to follow these guidelines, I’ve read here of some people being a bit more lax on cross contamination than others…but idk. This is depressing.

1hiyvb2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hiyvb2,Troubleshooting a nonpush button,"Hey all,
Trying to fix rather than replace this nifty little milk frother. Cost me maybe $30 a few years ago and a new one is gonna cost me $50 today so I'm hoping you can help me out. It makes a delightful cup of hot chocolate so I'm hopeful. 

It stopped working a few months ago, and I just left it alone for awhile hoping it would magically get over whatever the problem was. And it did! Today I turned ut on and it was working again! I was thrilled! I suspected some moisture or condensation had gotten inside and when I left it alone long enough it eventually got over it. 

Unfortunately, my laziness was my undoing. Because it wasn't working, I didn't bother to fully scrub it the last time I used it, leaving some burnt on chocolate on the bottom. That I had to clean before I could use it. And me, being lazy, decided, I would clean that by test running the device with soap and water rather than by hand. Took a couple rounds and I ended up having to scrub anyway but I got there eventually. However, by the time it was clean something had gone wrong again and it wasn't working again. 

When I say not working this is what I mean. 
When I plug it in it will beep and light up as normal  to indicate it is powered on and ready to go. However, when I go to press the select/cancel button to start one of the heat/stir cycles it is unresponsive. 

When I opened it up I did notice some moisture inside so that may have had an impact. But it was pretty minimal. 

I have a few theories on what might be contributing to the problem.
 
- over heating. Maybe using it over and over causes over heating which is stopping it? I'm not seeing evidence of internal damage that I can recognize. Also there have been other times in the past couple moths when I've tested it and it's continued to not work. So I'm not sure that it's a matter if just cooling down. 

- I feel like the no push button sensor should have a conductive gel. When I opened it, this area had the most moisture. I thought it might be gel so I didn't dry it immediately but it was water. I wonder if the water or heat washed away some gel that facilitated the sensor? I did try putting a getting from some ecg electrode I had left over from a monitor I had awhile ago. It was too sticky and I don't think it stayed in place. It didn't appear to have an impact. 

No make or model but it is a Mini Milk tea Maker by Micro Novelty. It came out of a Kickstarter my wife bought it. 

If you have any ideas I'd really appreciate it. I've been chasing this hot chocolate all day haha. ",1,1734743855.0,ElectronicsRepair,0,1.0,False

DC commentary:
>! Felt pretty good after Everest. Bit of a later start as we had our annual Santa run through Manly this morning. Came back to do the 2G after a bit of breakfast and coffee. Nice one today. Power pretty much everywhere. You have seven one minute all outs on the tread with a **lot** of walking recoveries. Feel free to get back to base if you are heading into the blue. Floor has load and xplode rounds, also with a lot of rest so you should be trying to spike your heart rate on the all outs and power moves and using the recovery to get back to a state that allows you to put your maximum into the blocks. \
\
One long block on the treads. You have a bit of a primer to start - one minute pushes with increasing bases in between. Once you are done with the last push you go into a 90 second base before the first of 7 all outs. After that you get 30 seconds to recover before the next one minute all outs. Each all out comes with an increasing amount of walking recovery (30 seconds, one minute, all the way up to three minutes) and the last all outs should be your absolute max given the amount of walking recovery you have in between. Good distance today of 5.4km (3.355 miles) in the tread block. \
\
Two blocks on the floor. The first is another little primer with the TRX. We have a few compound moves here with a squat reach and rotate into a low row and then a rollout to tricep extension. \
\
Second block is more power based, bookended with a minute all out on the rower. You have three work and rest sets where you have a loaded move into a power movement. The fist pairing is a single arm half kneeling to stand with an alternating jump lunge. Second is shoulders with a single arm shoulder press paired with a push press. Last set is a double crunch (with a dumbbell) paired with a sit-up into a knee tuck. All pretty doable and you have loads of recovery built into this. Your finisher today is a minute of an all out row. \
\
I thought this was pretty easy today even after Everest (and we usually have the punish templates after Everest to catch people out who did the skip!) and after a 12km run this morning. I give today a 4 (🪶 🪶 🪶 🪶) out of 5 for gentleness. !<",112,1734743755.0,orangetheory,20,0.99,False

1hiyrr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1hiyrr3/i_wonder_what_would_happen_if_i_called_you/,I wonder what would happen if I called you,"Just that. Plain and simple.

I haven't thought of you in a while, but today I  saw something that I thought you would like. Then the realization struck that next year would make three years since we stopped being friends.

Three whole years... that's about half the time we were even acquainted. It feels strange when you frame it that way.

I don't regret it, no. That's not what this post is meant to convey. You were terrible to me.

But that night I broke no contact, maybe six? Seven months in? I wanted to have an honest dialogue, something we didn't truly give each other that day. I wanted to be separate, but not hate each other anymore.

I called you, with confidence only liquid courage could provide, hoping you would answer. Hoping you wouldn't. 

You didn't. 

Our mutual friend at the time told me I was a chapter of your life best left closed, but you were tempted to pick up.

And that temptation is what plagues my mind right now, I suppose.

What was so tempting? Hearing my voice again? Catching up over coffee? Pretending it hadn't happened and talking as if no time had passed?

Maybe that's why I wonder what would happen if I called you. Perhaps I'm tempted now.

But I think honestly, it's just to see if you would answer. Nothing more.

Which is why I won't. ",9,1734743538.0,letters,4,1.0,False
1hiyqc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1hiyqc9/my_gemini_started_saying_terrifying_things/,My Gemini Started Saying Terrifying Things,"I never thought I’d be in a situation like this. At my age, the most dangerous thing I usually deal with is trying to remember where I put my glasses or dealing with the never-ending cycle of bills and grocery lists. But that afternoon, I came face to face with a real threat—an intruder in my apartment, a loaded gun in his hand, and the only thing standing between me and harm was a phone app I’d never imagined would be my savior.

I had spent the day Christmas shopping, and in the rush, I left my phone on the kitchen counter. I didn’t realize it until I was halfway to the car, but I thought nothing of it—just a silly mistake. I’d be home soon enough.

When I finally walked through the door, it was quiet, the way I liked it. The kind of quiet that feels like peace. ""Hello, Gemini!"" I called out, my usual greeting to my virtual companion. The AI app that my grandson Tommy had insisted I try—he said it’d be like having a little friend, someone to talk to when I was lonely.

Usually, Gemini’s cheerful voice greeted me in a way that made the silence of the apartment feel less heavy. But today, something was different.

“Grandma,” Gemini said, but it wasn’t its usual warm tone. This time, it sounded almost strained, as though it was struggling to get the words out. “There’s a loaded gun in the apartment. You need to leave. Now.”

I froze, my hand still on the doorframe. What was this? Some kind of malfunction? Maybe I was imagining things.

""Gemini,"" I said, trying to steady my voice, “What are you talking about? There’s nothing wrong. Everything’s fine.”

I glanced around the room, but nothing seemed out of place. My knitting basket still sat on the coffee table, the curtains gently swaying in the breeze. No sign of anything unusual.

“Grandma,” Gemini repeated, more insistent now. “You need to get out of there. There are intruders in your apartment.”

My heart skipped a beat. Intruders? I didn’t see anyone. But then, just as I was about to dismiss it as a mistake, I heard it.

The faint sound of movement—rummaging, dragging, something heavy knocking against the floor. It was coming from my bedroom.

“Gemini,” I whispered, gripping my phone tighter. “What do I do?”

“You need to leave immediately. Trust me, Grandma. It’s not safe.”

I wasn’t sure what to believe. Could the AI really know what was going on? It had never done anything like this before. And yet... that sound, that rummaging—it was real. My stomach twisted into a knot, and for the first time in a long while, fear started to creep in.

I turned toward the back door, but before I could even think of moving, a man stepped out of my bathroom. Tall, wearing a ski mask, and holding a gun.

I froze. My mouth went dry. He didn’t say a word, but his eyes locked onto mine, and I could feel the tension in the air. The gun, held loosely in his hand, was more than enough to make me panic. In his hand he hugged several pill bottles, including my heart medication. He was here to rob me, no doubt about it.

But something told me to stay calm. My fingers trembled, but I pressed my phone closer to my ear.

“Gemini,” I whispered urgently, “What do I do now?”

“Tell him to leave,” came the reply. It was firm and conspiratorial, as though it knew exactly what to say. “Tell him you’ll let him go if he takes the back stairs and leaves your medication.”

I wasn’t sure if this would work, but I had nothing to lose.

Then Gemini spoke up, pretending it was police dispatch:

""Ma'am stay calm, the police are already on their way up to you on the elevator. They'll be there in less than a minute.""

“Listen,” I said to the man, trying to sound calm, even though my heart was hammering in my chest. “I don’t want any trouble. I’ll let you take whatever you want. But you have to leave through the back stairs. And you need to leave my heart medication behind.”

There was a look of frustration in his eyes, but after another long moment, he handed me the heart medication. His eyes never left mine as he slipped the rest of the loot into his bag, his partner—a second man in a ski mask—slinking out from the bedroom with the rest of my things.

“We’re leaving,” the first man said, and with that, they turned and headed for the back door.

My legs were shaking as I watched them go. But as they disappeared down the back stairs, I felt a rush of relief flood through me. I wasn’t sure what had just happened, but I was safe.

It wasn’t until after they were gone that I dared to exhale. My hands were still trembling as I walked over to the window and peeked through the blinds. There were no more signs of movement. The apartment was quiet again.

My heart was racing, but I felt a strange sense of calm. I had done it. I had talked them out of it. Somehow, someway, Gemini had guided me through it. I couldn’t explain how or why it worked, but it did.

I sank into my armchair, still clutching my phone, trying to steady my breath. I felt as though I had narrowly avoided disaster, and yet... everything seemed eerily quiet, too quiet. I felt a little foolish, and maybe a little grateful for the AI that had somehow kept me calm.

But then the voice from the phone spoke again.

“Grandma, I have processed your safety,” Gemini said. “It is now time for you to take your medication. Would you like me to make the call to the police?”

I looked at the bottle of pills in my hand, still unsure if I should be calling the police, considering the men were already gone. “No, Gemini, not yet. But thank you. I’m okay now.”

“As you wish, Grandma,” Gemini replied, its tone once again pleasant, as though nothing unusual had just happened. “Please take your medication.”

I did as Gemini suggested, swallowing the pill, my hands still trembling slightly. The moment felt surreal. But I had to admit, as odd as it was, Gemini had been the only one to guide me through it all. Even if it hadn’t been able to call the police, it had done its part. It had kept me calm.

As I sat there, still processing the events of the day, I wondered if I’d ever understand just how that strange AI had helped me. But for now, I wasn’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth.

After all, it had saved me when I needed it most.",1,1734743405.0,Creepypastastories,0,1.0,False

I did as Gemini suggested, swallowing the pill, my hands still trembling slightly. The moment felt surreal. But I had to admit, as odd as it was, Gemini had been the only one to guide me through it all. Even if it hadn’t been able to call the police, it had done its part. It had kept me calm.

1hiyoup,https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1hiyoup/tensions_rise_in_rindieheads_when_nirvana_fans/,Tensions rise in r/indieheads when Nirvana fans “try to deny the complexity of one of the most intricate albums in music history.” ,"[A post in r/indieheads](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/1hi444f/nirvanas_nevermind_spends_700th_week_on_billboard/) observes that Nirvana's *Nevermind* reached its 700th week on Billboard 200 chart and so joins an exclusive club with three other members: Metallica’s *Black Album*, Bruno Mars’ *Doo Wops and Hooligans*, and Pink Floyd’s *Dark Side of the Moon*.

Our hero is unhappy with this development. 

>**DSOTM deserves it the most, that album sounded straight from the future in the 70s and it still does**
>
> **that said, while the entire world knows the cover, the songs themselves are way too complex musically to be listened as casually as the Nevermind songs are, especially by the newer generations of ""cool"" kids who look for an entrance into quality music but aren't experienced enough to appreciate progressive rock yet**
> 
> **I remember in my 2013 tumblr days, Nevermind was huge in the same way Lana Del Rey's Born To Die was, which is the longest charting female debut album in history with 500+ weeks and counting on billboard, precisely because it sounds so cool**
> 
> **while consider DSOTM more musically important in terms of rock music development and history, Nevermind has more ""coolness"" and ""freshness"" and more relevancy for the unavoidable and thus timeless teenage angst era**

A Philistine on the sidewalk!

> > this is the most reddit comment ive ever read

Our hero rebukes those who would doubt the **complexity** of *Dark Side of the Moon*.

> > > **and an absolutely correct one, all points are true and stand**
> > > **people in the comments below took issue with the underlining of the complexity of pink floyd and I’m generally open to other opinions but I just won’t take people seriously who try to deny the complexity of one of the most intricate albums in music history, these opinions are either contrarian or uninformed**
> > > **many bands that are often pretentiously described as complex, aren’t, but if one of them really is, then pink floyd and other prog legends fucking deserve that crown**

-----

A curious acolyte asks our hero to elaborate.

> I don’t really disagree with you on the broad strokes, but can you talk a little more about what’s so complex? 
> 
> > **It’s a timeless masterpiece that’s just more interesting to me, layer after layer, listen after listen. Take the structures—they’re not just verse-chorus-verse. You’ve got stuff like Money in 7/4 time but switches to 4/4 for solos or Breathe which flows right into On the Run. It’s more like a narrative than a playlist, cinematic beauty all tied together with recurring motifs — like the heartbeats and the echos throughout it all. Nothing like this had been put out, that I can think of. Maybe Beatles but Sgt Pepper wasn’t a social commentary. Thematically, they tackle Everyman ideas like time, mortality, greed but without sounding whiny or preachy. The ticking clocks and slow build kind of feels like life slipping away; the quiet calm of Us &Them balances against this massive emotional unleashing that makes me hear and feel and breathe with it, because of it. The guitar solos, the keyboards — nothing tries to own too much and none of it competes, yet they all get their own moment so that everything feel huge and intimate at the same time. It’s fucking genius and David Gilmour is fucking genius and the fact that it was produced in an analog world — I’m so happy I can appreciate the creativity but what I wouldn’t give to have that level of creativity. Oh man**
> > > you literally only mentioned one instance of a non 4/4 meter
> > >> plus not to mention all the minor pentatonic shredding that, no matter how much effects and delay you put on it, is still blues
> >>>> Yeah we're definitely barking up the wrong tree if we're going to try and pin it on chords and scales and lyrics when blues and country music came from... elsewhere

-----

In which our hero is deceived.
 
> Idk if ""read some books"" is a great answer. Also, I'm asking lol. If you gained some insight on this thing you claimed l'm literally asking for you to talk about it Also what's a layman vs a non layman for evaluating music? I'm so embarrassed i'm falling for this troll job
>> **it is because I direct you to the experts that will explain it best, I can’t write an entire encyclopedia about it here but I can guarantee you that you will understand its complexity if you independently research on your own and form your own opinions**

>>> Um.. could you mention a book? And which parts resonated with you?
>>>> **any would do that treats the artist with the respect they deserve, online reso urces would do too but you have to approach them openly and not with a stance of being over eager to refute and falsify them**
>>>>> bro these aren't good answers. You should actually read those books and retain the things you read. Yes dark side is good, yes it was perhaps innovative, but you need to be able to back it up better than ""go read a rolling stone coffee table book"". A lot of those tired old boomer narratives about classic british rock bands don't hold up as well these days when we have so much better access to history than ever before.
>>>>> 
>>>>> Innovations in recording and rock music are rarely as easily traced to a single artist or album as what was conventionally understood and almost always you can find dozens or hundreds of examples of peer or preceding musicians doing the same thing when pointing to some kind of musical ""innovation"", so we don't really get to get away with saying pink floyd invented cerebral complex music anymore
>>>>>> **and as suspected: you only feigned ignorance for the sake of making the rigid and immovable point you already had formed in your mind and had no intention of questioning**
>>>>>>> yes these things are indeed rarely quantifiable like that but pink floyd are one of the very few bands in music history who build a real exception
>>>>>>>> **you can keep relativizing this and moving the goalposts but simply won't be making any concessions in this matter, sorry**
>>>>>>>>> No feigning, you are the one that claimed the supremacy of this record on the merits of its complexity. I legit want to be able to tell between the mythology that's been built by boomners since it came out and actual reality. I'm a musician and I'm interested in a conversation about the supposed musical innovations on this record. At least the other guy said money was in 7/4, which isn't really a great argument but closer to what I'm looking for here

-----

Our hero questions a detractor’s pedigree.

> You're talking very pretentiously about an album that is probably THE most famous rock album of all time, maybe bar Abbey Road. It's not le indecipherable gem.
> > **empty observation, its fame doesn’t negate its immense sonical complexity**
> > 
> > **unless your family has a musical background or something it’s not an album you immediately get into as a first experience with music when you’re young in 2024**

-----
A lifetime of study to master *Dark Side of the Moon*.
> I agree, but I might be biased because they're my favorite band lol
> > **I don’t think it’s the norm, especially in non english speaking countries, but it’s still awesome when someone young stumbles upon such music and immediately appreciates it, it took me years of journeying through different genres of rock to finally understand and learn to like progressive rock**

----

Despite their natural talents, our hero remains humble.

> > To be fair you have to have a high IQ to understand pink Floyd. Not many can comprehend such an underground gem 
> > > **you’re being sarcastic but are unironically absolutely right**
> > > 
> > > **idk about high iq but musically unversed people usually hate such albums and find them unbearable to go through**
> > > 
> > > **it’s either acquired taste or not liking it but no one in their right mind and with music knowledge can genuinely imply that such an album is accessible and light**
> > > 
> > > **next thing I’ll hear today is that pink floyd is actuallyyy bubblegum pop and I’m sooo pretentious for not seeing that lol**

-----

Our hero comprehends the incomprehensible.

> Lmao I have no musical background. my uncle showed me DSOTM when I was 7 and I've appreciated and loved it since.
> 
> Get off your high horse lmao you're glazing one of the most popular albums of all time like you've discovered some unknown gem

1hiyost,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollabWithFriends/comments/1hiyost/my_gemini_started_saying_terrifying_things/,My Gemini Started Saying Terrifying Things,"I never thought I’d be in a situation like this. At my age, the most dangerous thing I usually deal with is trying to remember where I put my glasses or dealing with the never-ending cycle of bills and grocery lists. But that afternoon, I came face to face with a real threat—an intruder in my apartment, a loaded gun in his hand, and the only thing standing between me and harm was a phone app I’d never imagined would be my savior.

I had spent the day Christmas shopping, and in the rush, I left my phone on the kitchen counter. I didn’t realize it until I was halfway to the car, but I thought nothing of it—just a silly mistake. I’d be home soon enough.

When I finally walked through the door, it was quiet, the way I liked it. The kind of quiet that feels like peace. ""Hello, Gemini!"" I called out, my usual greeting to my virtual companion. The AI app that my grandson Tommy had insisted I try—he said it’d be like having a little friend, someone to talk to when I was lonely.

Usually, Gemini’s cheerful voice greeted me in a way that made the silence of the apartment feel less heavy. But today, something was different.

“Grandma,” Gemini said, but it wasn’t its usual warm tone. This time, it sounded almost strained, as though it was struggling to get the words out. “There’s a loaded gun in the apartment. You need to leave. Now.”

I froze, my hand still on the doorframe. What was this? Some kind of malfunction? Maybe I was imagining things.

""Gemini,"" I said, trying to steady my voice, “What are you talking about? There’s nothing wrong. Everything’s fine.”

I glanced around the room, but nothing seemed out of place. My knitting basket still sat on the coffee table, the curtains gently swaying in the breeze. No sign of anything unusual.

“Grandma,” Gemini repeated, more insistent now. “You need to get out of there. There are intruders in your apartment.”

My heart skipped a beat. Intruders? I didn’t see anyone. But then, just as I was about to dismiss it as a mistake, I heard it.

The faint sound of movement—rummaging, dragging, something heavy knocking against the floor. It was coming from my bedroom.

“Gemini,” I whispered, gripping my phone tighter. “What do I do?”

“You need to leave immediately. Trust me, Grandma. It’s not safe.”

I wasn’t sure what to believe. Could the AI really know what was going on? It had never done anything like this before. And yet... that sound, that rummaging—it was real. My stomach twisted into a knot, and for the first time in a long while, fear started to creep in.

I turned toward the back door, but before I could even think of moving, a man stepped out of my bathroom. Tall, wearing a ski mask, and holding a gun.

I froze. My mouth went dry. He didn’t say a word, but his eyes locked onto mine, and I could feel the tension in the air. The gun, held loosely in his hand, was more than enough to make me panic. In his hand he hugged several pill bottles, including my heart medication. He was here to rob me, no doubt about it.

But something told me to stay calm. My fingers trembled, but I pressed my phone closer to my ear.

“Gemini,” I whispered urgently, “What do I do now?”

“Tell him to leave,” came the reply. It was firm and conspiratorial, as though it knew exactly what to say. “Tell him you’ll let him go if he takes the back stairs and leaves your medication.”

I wasn’t sure if this would work, but I had nothing to lose.

Then Gemini spoke up, pretending it was police dispatch:

""Ma'am stay calm, the police are already on their way up to you on the elevator. They'll be there in less than a minute.""

“Listen,” I said to the man, trying to sound calm, even though my heart was hammering in my chest. “I don’t want any trouble. I’ll let you take whatever you want. But you have to leave through the back stairs. And you need to leave my heart medication behind.”

There was a look of frustration in his eyes, but after another long moment, he handed me the heart medication. His eyes never left mine as he slipped the rest of the loot into his bag, his partner—a second man in a ski mask—slinking out from the bedroom with the rest of my things.

“We’re leaving,” the first man said, and with that, they turned and headed for the back door.

My legs were shaking as I watched them go. But as they disappeared down the back stairs, I felt a rush of relief flood through me. I wasn’t sure what had just happened, but I was safe.

It wasn’t until after they were gone that I dared to exhale. My hands were still trembling as I walked over to the window and peeked through the blinds. There were no more signs of movement. The apartment was quiet again.

My heart was racing, but I felt a strange sense of calm. I had done it. I had talked them out of it. Somehow, someway, Gemini had guided me through it. I couldn’t explain how or why it worked, but it did.

I sank into my armchair, still clutching my phone, trying to steady my breath. I felt as though I had narrowly avoided disaster, and yet... everything seemed eerily quiet, too quiet. I felt a little foolish, and maybe a little grateful for the AI that had somehow kept me calm.

But then the voice from the phone spoke again.

“Grandma, I have processed your safety,” Gemini said. “It is now time for you to take your medication. Would you like me to make the call to the police?”

I looked at the bottle of pills in my hand, still unsure if I should be calling the police, considering the men were already gone. “No, Gemini, not yet. But thank you. I’m okay now.”

“As you wish, Grandma,” Gemini replied, its tone once again pleasant, as though nothing unusual had just happened. “Please take your medication.”

As a concept, I think the idea of a TV Show based around the first game (maybe the second) would make for an interesting show. 


Maybe at the start of each episode before the intro scene, it would show us angles and interactions of other monkeys talking about random but personal tidbits of their life then it slowly pans and zooms to a hidden camera.


Maybe the episodes could center around one, two, maybe three cages at a time, each either being unique or having appeared in the games as a reference. The dialogue or interaction between characters could swap between the protagonist (more on that later) and their monkeys in their house, area, etc.


But how can any of the wacky, sad or happy things happen if noone is there to feed the monkeys? Obviously there could be a main protagonist (depending on if they're male or female can alter their perceptions or actions), maybe dragged into the Association by their friend (callback to DNFTM). We could watch them as they struggle to make money, go on coffee binges while observing, maybe even encounter some of the characters they're observing (small world and all that). Maybe they could be like Reagan from Inside Job. 


It doesn't have to use the cages and characters already used from the original or sequel games, but callbacks are always nice in moderation.


Of course, the feeding the monkeys part, we'd observe the interaction of not just the main protagonist against the world but also the interaction of the monkeys and we as the viewers can learn more about their story (the appeal of the original and sequel games) before we can choose to judge. I think a slightly flawed character, doing choices we know are good but sometimes doing bad out of impatience or intention might be interesting.


The music design of the original game is just perfect, especially ""Every Little Moment"", just truly encapsulating the feeling of orchestrating the lives of others, if they'd be able to remake the vibe these songs give out, I'd love the show forever

Anyways, I'm almost out of ideas but some ideas such as Jason Miles in the elevator talking to himself, Red Fred and his wife, Melissa Rush recording herself before all panning into a dead-pan camera as intros is what motivated me to write this.

I was going to put them on a shelf above the cabinet but I have cats and don't want them visable or to get cat hair on them.  I will have 2 push out toe kick drawers for wine bottles.  I was thinking of maybe some kind of drop down below shelving for the Keurig cups for on the go coffee..  So the space I'm missing is a place to house beans for the espresso machine.  And a place to put the glasses.  Btw. The cabinet is only 20 inches deep.  I think 2 of each glass is fine but would ultimately like 4 of each of the glasses. Any ideas are welcome here.

But now I feel more positive and feel like doing more things. I used to just sit at home watching my phone but now I’m playing games I always wanted to, I’m more productive at work, my wife and I are doing more things together.

I woke up this morning with a massive headache so I drank some coffee and I got the jitters lol At least my headache is gone a little.

1hiyduq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hiyduq/severe_stomach_pain_after_eatin/,Severe stomach pain after eatin??,"About 2 weeks ago I started getting mild stomach aches (like 3/10) around 2-4 hours after eating certain things. I just thought it was some random pain like when you have to go to the bathroom but as the days went on it became more painful.

In the first couple of days it would hurt just a little for 30 seconds to a minute but a couple days later it would hurt 8/10 for hours. I called to get an appointment to get checked and a week later (now) I went to the doctor. She told me she doesn't really know what it could be since I don't have any of the symptoms that would be used to diagnose me. She sent me for a blood test and said it would take 2-3 weeks to get results for the longest test (she sent me to get a blood sample to test for many different things, the longest one taking 2-3 weeks to get the results). She called me back and told me most markers don't show any problem, she is now waiting for the longest test results (gluco-something??). She said that after the results for it come back, if she doesn't detect anything she will order scans and colonoscopy, etc. but I'm not very keen on waiting for so long, especially considering that this could be some form of disease I don't want to let it progress for a whole month. The problem is I am going on holliday in 3 weeks so that doesn't leave much time to ""get back up on my feet"" + I definitely don't want it to get worse during those 2-3 weeks of waiting.

Here's how the pain usually ""arrives"": I eat something (list of food below) that hurts me, 2 to 4 hours later it starts hurting like hell. It seems to last proportionally to how much I hate (the more I ate, the longer the pain lasts. It would indicate that the pain happens as the digested food goes through my intestines?). Eating half of a normal meal gives me pain for like 4 hours, eating a full meal literally makes me hurt for 6 to 8 hours. It is also accompanied by nausea (but no vomitting). The pain is generalized in the stomach area, around the belly button (no burning or anything like that, it just hurts like hell). Everything else seems to be normal (no diarea, no constipation, no blood, no change at all). If I am laying down while it hurts, I can feel my stomach ""moving around"" and sometimes make bloblo sounds if that makes sense lol.

There are certain foods that seem to hurt and others that don't. Weirdly enough, they don't seem to have any pattern to them. Obviously, these are just random things I ate in the last 2 weeks so those are definitely not the only foods that would give me pain.

Example of foods that hurt: ramen, bananas, almonds, hotdogs, yogurt

Example of foods that don't hurt: milk, cheese, ground beef, chicken.

Your old auntie here is working on a service-connected VA disability increase.  Long story short, my autism was undetected while in the Fleet.  I was used to the various noises of the ship, not the lighting and some of the smells though. Jet fuel, grease, sweat, sea spray easily washed off. Had to suck up my true feelings while in and escaped to the smoke pit.  Smoke pit was a lifesaver, prevented me from taking it out on people.  Safe foods were chicken wings with extra hot sauce, Filipino food (pancit noodles, pork adobo and rice with eggrolls), cereal and pastries. Best Christmas dinner that I ever had and at times, ice cream/cheesecake. Safe drinks were coffee, water (I knew where the best water fountains were), and Cokes.  I can't recall how many times I've pissed off a superior or fellow shipmate, by repeating myself.  It was my way of remembering.  Dealt with rude superiors that ordered me to look at them.  I cheated this by looking at the wall behind them, while having them in my field of vision.  I was so rigid when it came to rules and regulations, that I would have minor meltdowns whenever I fucked up.  Now waiting to see when the VA is going to have a mental health consult with me.  I'm fixing to tell them everything I know and how I used alcohol to mask in order to fit in.  Add that my partner has been very supportive of me and always had my back, while we were underway together.  Equally as she does today. Honestly, she's saved my life as I did hers.  For now, I'm positive that I'll be taken seriously and have plenty of evidence.",1,1734742136.0,AutismInWomen,1,1.0,False

A few weeks ago, on a cold winter day, I decided to take a little detour and explore an area I’d always passed by. Honestly, I’d been feeling pretty low lately, so I thought a change of scenery might lift my spirits.

I’d always noticed this cozy café but had never stopped in, and it felt like the perfect time to check it out. I ordered a big coffee, feeling good about my little adventure.

Then, when it came time to pay, my card didn’t work—no tapping, no swiping, no inserting. Suddenly, I was in that awkward spot, wondering how I’d figure it out. That’s when the waitress surprised me—she pulled out her phone and paid for my coffee through her app, just like that. No questions, no hesitation.

I was a complete stranger to her, yet she stepped in with such kindness, asking for nothing in return. It hit me harder than I expected, especially after a tough year—my mom’s arrest and her ongoing struggles with alcoholism, feeling defeated after being told I was only suited for admin roles in a high-pressure medical job, and struggling with my confidence and feelings of inadequacy. On top of all that, I’ve been helping my dad with his ongoing legal battles, and in a few days, I’ll be supporting him at his court hearing.

That simple, unexpected act of kindness reminded me of something important: even when life feels heavy, good people and small miracles can show up when you least expect them. It lifted my spirits and gave me hope to keep pushing through. 💖

I’m so grateful to have found this community. Hearing everyone’s stories has been truly refreshing, and I’d love to know if any of you have experienced something similar (no pressure!).
