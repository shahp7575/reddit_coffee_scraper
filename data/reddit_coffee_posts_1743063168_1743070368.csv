Dear \[Agent\]



\[SUBJECT\]

Set in Singapore, \[BROWN, BROWN EYES\] is a \[WORDCOUNT\]-word literary fiction novel with a central theme of grief and regret as in \[PLEASE LOOK AFTER MOM\], the introspective writing style of \[WEDNESDAY‚ÄôS CHILD\], and the harrowing impact of dementia as found in \[STILL ALICE\].

In 2050s Singapore, an unnamed elderly woman receives food delivered to her door every day from charity volunteers. She regales them with stories of her life and her best friend‚Äîdead forty years but still living strong in her memory. They‚Äôve been best friends since school, after all, and their time together shaped her life. But as her stories become more repetitive, and her memories more jumbled, the visits become shorter until finally, she finds the food hung outside her door with no one in sight.

Alone in a world that no longer wants to remember her, she sets out to find her dearest friend‚Äîthe one person who understands her better than anyone else. Her best friend‚Äôs waiting for her, if only she could remember where.

In between moments of clarity, she forgets that her friend is long dead, and the woman is convinced that if she just keeps searching, she'll remember where to go, and find her friend at last. Yet, each street feels eerily unfamiliar, the people she meets cold and unwelcoming, and she can‚Äôt quite remember where or when she last saw her best friend.¬†

For the sake of accurate and realistic representation, portions portraying dementia were crafted with guidance from \[neurology expert\] based in \[country\].

I am a 24-year-old Singaporean currently residing in \[city\]. Death, grief and dementia have played key roles in my life and I wanted to capture it in writing.

1jl0fv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jl0fv5/aio_for_telling_my_sister_46_to_go_back_to_the/,AIO for telling my sister (46) to go back to the homeless shelter?,"M is mom, S is sister  
  
When I was 18, I knew she was gonna kick me out. You screamed at me for the smallest things, or accused me of doing things I shouldn't, or anything else she could think of. Her ""real"" daughter hated me, always taking a chance to rile M up at me, S absolutely loved hurting me. I knew they were going to because I heard them whispering about it in M's room while I was in the hallway getting ready to do laundry. I felt soulcrushed, I knew they said heinous things behind my back but to hear it aloud anyway still burned. What's worse is they had a plan to start asking me to pay bills, and once they took the ""first 3 months' pay"" since I had been there for around that much time after I turned 18, they would just kick me out. I don't know the logistics of how that would've turned out, but it didn't matter since the day after I started emptying out my room.



 I rented a space a storage unit in one of those warehouses and just brought my stuff there on ""errands"". M didn't notice until a month later when I changed my sheets for hers and got pissed since ""I didn't buy any of that, so I had no right to move it"" even though most everything in my room was mine, I even had to buy my own curtains.  By that point only my mattress (I had no bed frame) and desk left. Most everything except decorations I cared nothing about, M finally realized it was actually very baren, then got into a screaming match about family. When I brought up M's plan to kick me out it looked shocked, but tried to play it off like a joke, when I asked if I had to pay rent M said, ""yes you will be, starting today, but if you pay me, I won't kick you out."" I didn't care for that offer, and didn't want to take an olive branch when I knew it had a good chance of snapping. I was out then and there, packed the final go bag I put everything of mine in like extra brushes and toothpaste, and my laptop and other belongings and bailed. 

  
After I left, I lived on the streets for a long time, buying a van, and eventually landing an online receptionist job. I decided to save every penny and after 5 years and so much bug bounty hunting, I finally got a house, and it was amazing. However, two weeks ago I got a phone call, from M with a shaky voice asking about my house and life. Stupidly I told them I was fine, since my hatred had faded, but I still thought maybe M cared, or was sorry. I was wrong, M asked to come over to talk, I suggested coffee, but M insisted coming over. When I agreed about an hour later M and S arrived and sat down on my couch. They were being suspiciously nice and complementing everything. After less than 10 minutes they broke down with a sob story about being homeless and needing help. 



I could not care less, I told them to leave, and they said they won't, I said OK and went into my bathroom to call the police. They started to smash things outside and bash on the door, S actually managed to break into it (I didn't know people could do that and am getting my handles replaced) and snatched my phone smashing it on the ground. Literally 3 minutes later the police arrived, I checked the time on my oven clock while they followed me around the house as yelled to get out, every time I moved a room they trailed after me. When the cops showed up, I told them they broke into my house and tried to hurt me. I didn't know if they were gonna and didn't want to find out. They actually told the cops it was their house, and I tried to R word them, keep in mind I do not look like a man, but am trans, so there was confusion there. It took 5 minutes to clear it up, but we were all dragged to the station anyway. 

Skipping the boring bits I got called by my yelling aunt who got fed some bs story, after I clarified and showed pictures of my house she was fuming, but not at me. I asked why M lost her house, and she told me she got bought out since she wasn't paying her property taxes, somehow that lead to a man showing up asking for way more, and saying if it wasn't paid they would take their house. I don't know why M didn't pay and don't care, but now since she was bailed out she's going on social media crying about me. 

  
Today was the final straw, S called me, and begged me to let her stay, and she was sorry and yada yada, I really didn't wanna listen so I was just gonna hang up. However, before I could S said, ""You have no idea how hard it is, I'm a real woman, these people are going literally to touch me, and you don't care!"" I told her to ""You don't have to worry about that since nobody is gonna R word your ugly behind anyway."" (using sfw language)

  
To make it clear, I think I did overreact by telling them to screw off immediately. I have a spare room I use as an office, but I just hate the thought of living with those animals again, so Am I Overreacting?",1,1743069839.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

I have been experimenting with coffee beans for last three years but I feel like I keep forgetting the taste of previous one as I finish my later batch of coffee. And always confused when I need to order next batch. Of course personal taste preferences differ but if someone has tried these coffees and has similar palette, would love to know if there's something else to explore or if to stop my search and just go with one of my loved ones.

  
PS: I went through all my order history on gmail to find the ones I ordered and spent last 1 hour to write this post and, even though i'm sure I must've missed out a couple, it feels great to have written this down. Maybe I should create a coffee journal.

Most Israelis now fearful of a Kahanist police force and an insurgent autocracy never made a connection with the arbitrary abuse of Palestinians by vigilante settlers and the IDF in the West Bank. But now Tulkarm is coming to Tel Aviv, and Israelis should be asking: When the authorities come for me, who will stop them?

On Saturday, two Israeli soldiers walked into a restaurant in the West Bank city of Tulkarm. They were in full battle gear and their faces were covered with black balaclavas, a common practice in the army. The restaurant's security cameras didn't capture sound but showed a number of young Palestinian men standing behind the counter looking dazed as the soldiers shouted at them.

One of the soldiers lurched and then ‚Äì just ahead of the Ramadan iftar meal ‚Äì shoved a pile of cookies onto the ground, barged around the counter, tossed a chair into the air and pulled one of the men out onto the street. The men stood there limply, barely moving except to raise their empty palms.

There was no context, and the video was clipped short. Surely one can think of all sorts of explanations: Perhaps the man the soldiers pulled out was suspected of something. Perhaps not a minute earlier, he had thrown stones.

What we know for sure is that violent intrusions by heavily armed soldiers, shrouded in menace and anonymity, are part of life for Palestinians everywhere. They are there in cities in the West Bank's Area A like Tulkarm and Jenin ‚Äì nominally under Palestinian Authority administrative and police control, but where the IDF has undertaken a full-scale military operation and occupation since January. Those operations have displaced as many as 40,000 people, while protecting Israeli thugs who terrorize Palestinians unfortunate enough to live next to their settlements

What we also know is that most Israelis will assume, sight unseen, that somewhere off camera was an existential security threat. Simultaneously, we know that most Israelis don't see any connection between the Israeli violence that is constant in Palestinian lives and the rising threats to their own civil and political rights, and their safety ‚Äì if they see or consider such violence at all.

We know that throughout the 39 weeks of the mass democracy movement of 2023, most Israelis did not notice any obvious link between the Netanyahu government's judicial assault that they loathed and the occupation. One Saturday evening at a demonstration, a 20-something I know said something to me that has never faded. Gazing with irritation toward the small ""bloc against the occupation"" demonstrators who were practically swallowed by the huge crowd, he mused: ""What's with the occupation issue now? What's the connection?""

For nine months, Israelis didn't turn out in such extraordinary numbers due to a theoretical opposition to autocracy; they flooded the country's streets because they thought this particular program to crush Israel's democratic institutions would affect them personally.

Now, way, way too late, is the time to realize that Tulkarm is coming to each and every Israeli. No one is safe.

To be clear, ""Tulkarm behavior"" and its routine, arbitrary intimidation is not acceptable for anyone. Still, Israelis should hear loud and clear, ""You're next."" If Israelis had realized that they would be their own next victims, perhaps they would have tried to change the country's policies earlier, and that would have been easier than defeating the insurgent autocracy of today.

There were signs over the years. In 2016, the father of an American immigrant family described a vicious Kafkaesque nightmare of Israeli police arrest, interrogation and violation of due process, including the detention of his 14-year-old daughter, all because of a text she had sent a friend joking that her parents were growing weed.

Four years earlier, Israelis found out about Ben Zygier, then known only as Prisoner X, who had died in 2010 in the country's highest-security prison in a suicide-proof cell ‚Äì but apparently not proofed enough. He was a Jewish Australian immigrant and deeply Zionist, but not safe in the Jewish state. Did he commit crimes? Apparently. Did he deserve to die by suicide under a double gag order, stripped of his own name, in solitary confinement?

It should have been a sign that Israel was already losing its guardrails even for its own citizens. Now, the government is finally attempting to fire the guardrails that remain, like the attorney general, and reengineer the Judicial Appointments Committee, while hoping to install an obedient head of Israel's powerful domestic security agency, the Shin Bet. Now those officials who have represented and enabled the current government or did so in the past are saying they don't recognize this Israel.

Attorney General (for now) Gali Baharav-Miara responded to the government's move to sack her by writing that the government seeks ""unlimited ruling power ... The government wants to be above the law, and act without review or balances."" Benny Begin, the son of Menachem Begin, the legendary first prime minister from Benjamin Netanyahu's own Likud party, wrote that the government wants to rule ""without limits and without wisdom, in a new regime whose name is not yet known but which is definitely not democracy.""

Now, Israelis are or damn well should be asking themselves: When the government or state authorities come for me, who will stop them?

The incidents keep coming. News reports this week revealed that earlier this month, the Shin Bet snatched an employee at the Prime Minister's Office and a 70-year-old protest leader for four days of interrogation. The agency says it suspected that the employee leaked information about the prime minister's whereabouts to the protest activist. The evidence? According to the Ynet news website, the activist had sent a text message to the employee, who reportedly knew the activists' daughter, saying, ""Should we talk?"" The employee never even answered.

When Amit Segal, a journalist close to the prime minister, broke a story on Sunday that the Shin Bet was investigating whether far-right Kahanism had infiltrated the police ‚Äì ""undermining governing procedures"" ‚Äì newly reinstalled National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a long-time Kahanist himself, became unhinged.

At a security briefing, Ben-Gvir reportedly screamed at Shin Bet head Ronen Bar that he was a criminal who should be in jail; Bar retorted: ""Yesterday you threatened to prosecute me, today you're threatening to put me in jail and tomorrow you'll take me out to be executed."" A reporter for the daily Maariv thought that he said this ironically, but apparently, Bar doesn't feel safe either.

That Israel's police force has been invaded by Kahanists and often behaves like a far-right militia under Ben-Gvir's direction is no longer a particularly controversial contention. Nor is the fact that the police are increasingly inept and partisan in their crime-solving capacities: Arab citizens are dying at a furious rate, and the police can't clear 15 percent of their cases. Citizens of the non-Kahanist persuasion will never be safe from them.

In a separate announcement, Ben-Gvir dug in, fuming again that Bar was a criminal, a threat to democracy; he should be in jail ‚Äì in solitary confinement ‚Äì for staging an attempted coup. As a special insult to pretty much every single Israeli, Ben-Gvir demanded that the prime minister establish a government commission of inquiry, while the government has crushed all demands to investigate the failures of October 7. All systems, it turns out, exist to protect the regime.

How much more will it take?
Regular citizens can still argue that this hate triangle between the Prime Minister's Office, the police and the Shin Bet (and the attorney general too) is really an elite tussle ‚Äì it doesn't have much to do with regular folks.

Okay, Israeli citizens, please consider this (Americans, listen up too). You worked for years on a novel, or, say, a film. You hit it out of the ballpark! Your team literally wins an Oscar. A few weeks later, a dozen maniacal masked thugs storm your little village in the hills with batons, knives and at least one assault rifle; they stalk the village, attack your property and your friends who come to defend you, and smash up cars with rocks while your friends are still inside.

That's what the Center for Jewish Nonviolence activists at the scene reported and filmed from the Masafer Yatta region of the West Bank. Being American Jews offered no protection; the thugs attacked them too, an activist told me. And the soldiers, never far behind the thugs, whisked the film's co-director away, having blindfolded and beaten him, he testified. He has since been released, which hardly changes the situation.

Someone will surely point out with righteous rage that an Arab Palestinian citizen of Israel murdered an elderly man Monday morning. But neither that attack, nor making a film, nor being Palestinian in Masafer Yatta should matter: The problem is that anything these days is an excuse for vigilante lawlessness, it seems. Citizens who haven't experienced this are just waiting their turn.

You, reading this over coffee in Tel Aviv, or Modi'in. If you go to a friend's place for Shabbat dinner this Friday in the suburbs, guard your backyard: Perhaps a gang will break into your house, remove your TV, furniture and belongings, and bring troops armed to the teeth to make sure nobody gets too close while they toss your life's work into the street. That's what happened Monday in Hebron.

Your turn is coming too. It was never going to be contained. Don't just sit around and wait.",1,1743068885.0,World_Now,0,1.0,False

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. I won‚Äôt bring any drama into your life. 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries.

I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s tgats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here 

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don‚Äôt work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I‚Äôve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup akso no fake tan or  fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

She said it was harmless and not to worry, just unwanted attention from a warehouse worker. But just by coincidence this bloke kept on popping up at random places we were at together. Shops, bars, hardware stores etc. He would always go out of his way to say hi and I could tell something was up. She blushed and behaved in such a way that body language gave it away. 

Anyways she moved on from that place 2 years ago and would you believe it, old mate starting working there 1 month ago. Just as of today I asked her how work was, she said the usual comments, complained of the usual stuff etc. When I got home she was in her uniform. But as I picked up my kids from late night boxing, one of the other mums that we are mutual friends with asked how she is feeling...Confused I asked what she meant. Apparently they saw each other at a coffee shop in the city and she was having a sick day,  and ""having a rest day"" she wasnt in uniform.

Also plus this might not be a nice thing to say, but the post sex smell that we all know about was prevelant on my wifes clothes. 

On a side note, she admitted that she always cheated on her previous partners when she was late teens/early twentys. I was young and naive.

I have 4 sons, and recently just bought the family farm, big $$$. I earn good money and provide very well. One of my sons is intellectual disabled and 1 son is going to uni to start Medicine.

1jkzzeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jkzzeu/help_with_bingeeating/,Help with binge-eating,"Hi,

I binge-eat once a week. I try to control myself but there is a day, every week, where I just cannot help myself and binge on whatever is in the house (or if I am desperate for chocolate, as I usually crave that, I go on crazy shopping sprees that i definetley cannot afford weekly). 

I am on a diet. I am a 21 yr old female, 1.63m, currently weighing 52.8kg as of this morning. My goal weight is 50kg - my weight is stored in the lower part of my body and I am still very uncomfortable withe the weight there that will not come off. I was 57 kg at my highest in january. 

I work out (usually cardio, streching, yoga and taekwondo 2x week) at least 5 days a week, I am very active - try to walk if I can as I do not have a car. I try to stay on a 1400 kcal deficit, but with how busy I have been, I doubt that I get to 1200 kcal lately. I hate eating big portions, especially when I am at work, so I just end up doing two small meals of maybe 700-800 kcal for those and then a banana or something small in between and tons of coffee. I do not like bread and stuff like that because I hate how I can feel it in my stomach and I bloat like crazy, and also my braces limit what food I can eat. 

When I binge, I usually crave chocolate and those peach sugar covered gummy things, and the time varies with the earliest being at 12am (that one made me feel soooo guilty because in my head, sweets are not allowed before dinner). I usually do not eat after 6 pm because I cannot sleep if I have something in my stomach, and this rule is so internalised in me that I do not binge after 6, but I did recently have a binge at 9pm.

1jkzy0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/1jkzy0m/fear_city_first_episode_laughable/,Fear city first episode - laughable,"Just finished the first episode of  Fear City, and I have to ask: did the writers open Google Maps even once? This thing takes place in New York, right? Because everyone sounds like they're fresh out of Georgia. Why is every single character speaking in a Southern accent like they're two steps away from marryin' their cousin? We're in Manhattan here, best case is Weekawken. There are no southern accents to be found here. 

People keep talking about Hilltop as if it's close by.  Hilltop is in Virginia. You know, the state that is at best a 6-hour drive from NYC when the roads exist. In the post-apocalypse, you‚Äôre looking at what, two weeks minimum if you're lucky and don‚Äôt get eaten? But no, in Fear City it's apparently just over the river and through the woods. This is America for little kids. 

And then there's Maggie just... stumbling across Negan near New York. Was he just loitering around Secaucus hoping she'd swing by? What is he doing there? Are we supposed to believe the guy just meandered his way up the Eastern Seaboard and decided to hang out in North Jersey like it‚Äôs no big deal?

Also, does anyone working on this show grasp how staggeringly large the New York metro region is? It‚Äôs not a cute little village with some suburbs slapped on. You don‚Äôt walk from Tribeca to Yonkers in a coffee break. Yet here we are with a bunch of characters treating New York like it‚Äôs Mayberry with skyscrapers.

And what in the actual hell is this ‚ÄúNew Babylon‚Äù cowboy town? A full-on Western-themed post-apocalyptic society just chilling across the Hudson like it‚Äôs Deadwood on the Hudson River? People wearing dusters and riding horses through what, Fort Lee? That‚Äôs your gritty vision of dystopian NYC?

The obsession with the Empire State Building is laughable too. Every character keeps gazing at it like it‚Äôs Mount Doom and then pulling out a map of downtown like it‚Äôs some ancient treasure map. It‚Äôs the most photographed building in the world, not an ancient monolith. And news flash, this building is in midtown, even though all the dialogue and maps call for Downtown. Has anyone involved in this production even been to New York? Or is this just America's collective fantasy version of NYC, some weird ‚Äúbig town surrounded by small towns‚Äù concept that completely misses the actual scale and complexity of the region?

This isn't just lazy writing. It seems like a weird American concept of New York. Is that how you view us? Like we're just Texans but with tall buildings? It's fucking weird.

1jkzqnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoLivingTrends/comments/1jkzqnt/a_guide_to_renting_furnished_apartments_in/,A Guide to Renting Furnished Apartments in Berlin's Trendiest Neighborhoods,"Berlin has steadily gained a reputation as one of Europe‚Äôs most dynamic urban hubs. With its blend of cutting-edge technology, burgeoning startup scene, vibrant art districts, and storied history, it's no surprise that many people are choosing to relocate here, whether temporarily or long term. For newcomers and temporary residents, renting a furnished apartment is often the most practical option. Not only does it eliminate the logistical hurdles of purchasing furniture and setting up utilities, but it also allows for a seamless transition into Berlin life. As demand has grown, so too has the supply of stylish, fully-equipped apartments in the city‚Äôs most sought-after neighborhoods. Understanding where to look and what to expect is essential for anyone considering this route.

In this guide, we‚Äôll cover what to look for when renting furnished apartments in Berlin, break down the city‚Äôs trendiest neighborhoods, and give you a few solid tips to help you land a place that fits your budget and lifestyle.

# Why Choose a Furnished Apartment in Berlin?

A lot of folks moving to Berlin for the first time (myself included, a few years ago) face the same problem: where do I live without going through months of setup? That‚Äôs where furnished apartments come in. They‚Äôre ideal for anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to spend time and money finding furniture, setting up WiFi, or buying kitchen gear from scratch.

Many of these apartments come with utilities included in the rent, which helps avoid juggling bills in German. They‚Äôre especially useful for freelancers, students, and those on temporary contracts. Most are available on flexible leases, so you‚Äôre not tied down forever if your plans change. It‚Äôs also worth noting that Berlin's rental market moves fast. Furnished rentals, because of their ready-to-go nature, can sometimes bypass the long queues you'd face when applying for an unfurnished flat.

You‚Äôll still need to provide documentation‚Äîproof of income, ID, and sometimes a SCHUFA report‚Äîbut many landlords renting furnished places are familiar with expat needs and are more lenient with newcomers.

# Navigating Berlin‚Äôs Rental Market (Without Losing Your Mind)

If you‚Äôre new to Berlin, prepare for some bureaucracy. The market is regulated, which is good for tenants but can feel rigid when you're used to more casual rental setups elsewhere. Rent caps exist, but furnished units sometimes have a bit more wiggle room on price due to the added services.

Be ready with a digital folder of your documents: passport, proof of income, and a basic introduction letter. Landlords often get dozens of inquiries for each listing, so make your message stand out by being concise, polite, and enthusiastic.

Don‚Äôt forget: just because it‚Äôs furnished doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs move-in ready. Ask for an inventory, confirm what's included, and check the cancellation terms. Some listings will wow you in pictures but underwhelm in person. When possible, schedule viewings or use verified platforms with reviews and virtual tours.

# Trendiest Neighborhoods for Furnished Rentals

# Kreuzberg

Living in Kreuzberg is a rite of passage for many newcomers. It‚Äôs lively, eclectic, and multicultural. There are hipster coffee shops on every corner, a never-ending array of food from around the world, and more street art than you can count. Rent-wise, it‚Äôs not the cheapest, but you‚Äôre paying for vibe and access.

Furnished apartments here usually lean minimalist or artsy. Think converted industrial lofts or compact studios with creative flair. Public transport is excellent, and you‚Äôre always within walking distance of bars, shops, and parks.

# Friedrichshain

The cool cousin of Kreuzberg. Friedrichshain is a favorite among students and younger expats. It's packed with clubs, coworking spaces, and relaxed cafes. The East Side Gallery is here, and there's no shortage of weekend markets and street festivals.

It‚Äôs a good spot if you want affordability without sacrificing energy or access. Many [Friedrichshain apartments](https://www.vondereurope.com/location/berlin/complex/110018) are renovated, come fully stocked, and offer solid internet‚Äîgreat for remote workers. Plus, the transport links here make it easy to explore the rest of the city.

# Charlottenburg

If you‚Äôre after peace, green spaces, and a more ""grown-up"" vibe, Charlottenburg delivers. It‚Äôs home to embassies, museums, and high-end retail. The architecture is classic, and there‚Äôs a slower pace of life compared to Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain.

Furnished apartments in Charlottenburg tend to be larger and more traditional. You‚Äôll find well-maintained buildings, concierge services, and a strong community feel. It's ideal for families or professionals looking for stability.

# What to Know Before Signing the Lease

Even though furnished rentals simplify a lot of things, make sure to read the lease carefully. Here‚Äôs what to double-check:

* **Utilities**: Are they included? Ask about internet too.
* **Inventory list**: Know what‚Äôs in the flat and what condition it‚Äôs in.
* **Minimum stay**: Some landlords require 3- or 6-month commitments.
* **Deposit**: Usually one to three months' rent.
* **Notice period**: Important if your plans change.

Also, document the flat on move-in day. Take photos of everything and save them. It‚Äôll save you stress later.

Platforms that specialize in furnished rentals are your best bet. They often come with tenant protections, verified listings, and helpful customer service. You‚Äôll also find a decent number of [fully furnished apartments in Berlin](https://www.vondereurope.com/location/berlin) available through these services.

# Working in Berlin? Corporate Apartments Might Be Your Move

If you‚Äôre relocating for work, consider [corporate apartments in Berlin](https://www.vondereurope.com/location/berlin/complex/323193). They‚Äôre pricier but designed with professionals in mind. Think: fast WiFi, a desk, weekly cleaning, and proximity to business districts or transit lines.

These spaces let you hit the ground running. No IKEA trips, no setup, just check-in and go. Ideal for short contracts or transition periods while you‚Äôre house-hunting more long-term options.

# Final Thoughts

Berlin has something for everyone. Whether you want the grit and buzz of Kreuzberg, the youthful charm of Friedrichshain, or the calm elegance of Charlottenburg, there‚Äôs a furnished apartment with your name on it.

If you're planning a move, start early, keep your documents ready, and be flexible. Furnished rentals can make the whole process smoother and less stressful‚Äîespecially when you're just settling into the city.",1,1743066611.0,CoLivingTrends,0,1.0,False

1jkzpkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1jkzpkw/does_he_like_me_how_to_keep_contact_over_text/,Does he like me? + how to keep contact over text?,"Hi. I'm 15F, and my crush is 14M turning 15.

We know each other though a sort of bi-weekly Christian high school group that gets together-- technically Christian at least, though it's not very religion-focused. Yes we pray, and yes we participate in Christian friendly lessons and it takes place at a church, but that's about it. There isn't any bible study or what you would normally expect outside of that, and the church is more-so a location it's hosted at then a place we get together to worship. If anything it's more like short classes-- 3 of them. Normally he attends the last two.

Anyways, because it's only bi-weekly we don't get to talk to each other much-- recently got his phone number since we were in a group chat together (a month ago) but I've been too anxious to text-- I've also invited him + the rest of the group to a coffee meetup that's usually held for high schoolers. He was the first person to let me know he was coming but then backed out when I told him I hadn't heard from any guys if they would be there-- respectfully so, since he was uncomfortable being the only guy.

But even though it's only every two weeks, we're, I guess, pretty close-- at least as you could get within meeting each other every 2 weeks for 3-4 hours. 

We're probably the jokesters of the group I guess you could say, and cause of that we get along well. My humor is pretty stupid, but he digs it. During lessons we're usually cracking jokes. The first day I made a joke and the next time we met, he gave me a nickname related to that joke. There was also a time when our teacher put us in a group chat with the other group members asking to confirm who would be at next week's class-- I said I could go, and he replied with ""yesss (my nickname)!"" And then said he could make it too. There's not lots of time to have conversations cause right after class we usually leave-- except last time he was there, when we managed to squeeze a few time to talk with our friends. It was awesome, even though half the time I didn't know what it was about.

Now, I'm not good with picking up emotions-- but I've sorta learned that I'm picking up feelings for this guy after how our few interactions made me feel. I love it and the it at the same time. I love that he's a good person-- wonderful personality, too. He's a pretty funny person who seems kindhearted and shares *a lot* of the same interests with me. *however,* I sometimes get overwhelmed about the whole crushing thing. It's always a battle of *am I pushing too hard? Am I not pushing enough? Will I ever be to late?* and all that.

(!)There's a few things that he's done that just kinda stuck in my head-- that I can't tell if it's him just being nice or him trying to be affectionate. One of them was the nickname calling he did, of course. Another thing was that he's usually smiling at me and laughing at all the silly jokes I make-- he makes his own too. but the reason I'm making this post is kind of about one specific one that seems oddly affectionate, however I don't even know where to begin.

So I'm just gonna explain the beginning of it: 2 hangouts ago (that he's gone two) or maybe more, the ""teacher"" doing our drivers ed is giving us a demonstration of how to properly drive or something (it's drivers ed) with a board, markers, and toy cars to help us visualize it,

Everybody's kinda standing around it while I'm off to the side, sitting down but close enough to where I'm not distant and can still see-- maybe a few feet away. I was cursed with horrible stomach pain right when I got there because *surprise,* i was cursed with the monthly girly issues and didn't have any medicine to help. Iykyk. 

Regardless of that I've been in a happy mood-- cracking jokes n whatnot while trying not to look like my stomach is killing me, lol.

(!) Now, with that kind of backstory, I have my legs out and crush lightly places his foot/shoe on top of mine. It's so obviously he did it intentionally and he was smiling as he did it-- might have been laughing/giggling too? I know affection is a good sign but wow, boys can be confusing. He did it lightly to where it didn't cause me any pain-- barely felt it, actually. Light and intentional. 

I don't know if he knew I was in pain or not-- didn't seem like it? I was trying to hide it and whatnot but idk if I did a good job. 

Am I onto something here? Is he *potentially* crushing or just being nice? If he is-- I feel like I might be screwed. Our very last meetup, at least for two months until they do it again, is coming up in less than a week. I'm anxious! Now, I'll be fine with not seeing him for that long-- it'll suck, yea, but it's not the end of the world... what I'm worried about is if he'll show up to the next one (or any future event for that matter) and I loose my chance. I want to keep in contact-- either as friends or more. 

That's why I'm asking two things today; how to keep contact over text with your crush, and if he's feeling for me potentially. What would be the best way to keep in contact? I'm not really a social person over text as much as I am irl, but we have a lot of interests, so that might help? First thing that comes to mind is video games and potentially tv shows. And if he does potentially have feelings for me, how do I reciprocate them in a way that isn't too pushy? Should I give him a nickname too or-- idk, something. My main fear is being too pushy and he ends up being uncomfortable-- I wanna be respectful, and everytime I think of reciprocating that affection I'm worried about making him feel weird. Really any help will do-- I don't want to blow my chance, if I even have one, thank you so much for reading.

TLDR: how do I keep in contact with my crush over text and is he showing signs of crushing on me?  Paragraphs with the (!) are about signs I've noticed but aren't too sure on-- reading the full thing might help, but I understand I wrote *a lot* and not everyone has the time to read that. Regardless, any help or advice is so important to me! I feel like I'm on a deadline and any advice or help is appreciated greatly! Thank you for reading",1,1743066470.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False
1jkzovj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1jkzovj/suggested_grinder_settings_constantly_change/,Suggested grinder settings constantly change,"Hi everyone,

I've noticed that on my recently purchased Ninja Luxe Premier Cafe, the grind setting seems to change after every coffee made. I understand that the grind advice can adjust as the coffee beans age and that it might differ when preparing a different type of coffee. However, in my case, when making double espressos all day, the grind advice fluctuates dramatically: it starts at 15, then drops to 7, goes up to 10, and then jumps to 20.

Also sometimes hardly any espresso's comes out of the portafilter. 

Has anyone experienced this issue or have any insights on why this might be happening?

1jkznfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/composting/comments/1jkznfx/to_reheat_or_not/,To reheat or not?,"Hi all. I was hoping some of you could share your expertise with me.

Lately I've been experimenting with ways to speed up the decomposition of raw wool as I have access to unlimited amounts of it.

My current approach has involved keeping the bin hot for extended periods by adding coffee grounds and cardboard periodically. It's been hot for about 1.5 months now. My hope was that this would speed up the breaking down of the keratin in the wool. 

The coffee and cardboard decompose way faster than the wool, so I don't feel that continuing to add things is a big problem. They disappear long before the wool breaks down.

I just got back from a holiday, so the pile hasn't been turned in over a week. The temp has dropped to about 90f and there has been an absolute explosion in mushrooms. They are everywhere. It's kinda beautiful.

Anyway, my question:

Should I turn the pile and let the mushrooms do their thing at the lower temp? Or should I add more browns and greens to bring it back up to a high heat, killing the mushrooms, but increasing the microbial population?

My goal is to break down the wool as quickly as possible.

Another thing is that I seem to be pretty immune to coffee, I can have more than 3 to 4 cups a day or a lot of espressos but still tired.  I usually go to sleep at 12 and wake up at 7am to go to school, I googled it and it says it's enough for people age like me to sleep about 6-8 hours.

I took a day off today because I woke up feeling tired and I didn't wake up until 12 pm today, woke up and had some food did some homework and then I felt tired again I went back to sleep so went back to sleep and slept for 3 hours more.

That‚Äôs how it started with her, anyway. We met by chance at a park bench, both of us with our noses in books, pretending the world didn‚Äôt exist. She looked up, cracked a good one,I laughed, and just like that, we were sharing space in this quiet little corner of the universe.

For months, it felt like we were co-tenants in some unspoken agreement. We‚Äôd meet up,sometimes planned, sometimes not and just talked. Texts and video sharing among ourselves. I thought we were building something, you know? Like a landlord who‚Äôs proud of the cozy little place they‚Äôve fixed up, expecting the tenant to stick around because it‚Äôs home.

But here‚Äôs the thing about tenants,they don‚Äôt always tell you when they‚Äôre leaving. One day, the texts slowed down. The ‚Äúhey, you free later?‚Äù messages I sent started getting ‚Äúmaybe next time‚Äù replies, until they didn‚Äôt get replies at all. I‚Äôd see her online, posting about hikes or that same coffee shop, but it was like I‚Äôd been evicted from her world without a notice pinned to the door. I kept showing up to our spot, though, like some stubborn landlord checking an empty apartment, hoping the key would turn and she‚Äôd be there with a grin and a ‚Äúsorry, got caught up.‚Äù

Weeks turned into months, and I started piecing it together. She‚Äôd been packing up her stuff,her time, her attention, her little quips,while I was still watering the plants and fixing the leaky faucet of our friendship. I‚Äôd been pouring myself into this one-sided lease, thinking we were on the same page, but she‚Äôd already signed a new contract somewhere else. Maybe with someone who didn‚Äôt ramble about nature or overthink every silence.

I'm 1,000 days sober today. Heading to 3 years in July. Here's what has helped me:

‚Ä¢ Cherry pick the advice you see here, in books, and elsewhere. Hit upon the right mix of tools that work for you. Like trying a few combinations on a safe door before it clunks open.

‚Ä¢ Fast forward the tape. How will having a drink now affect me tomorrow morning? What's happened before? A slide back into what? It‚Äôs a good way to remind yourself to be kinder to yourself, and that you have the power to remove yourself from the torture.

‚Ä¢ Don't 'white knuckle it' this time. Use other ways to deal with the pangs and they will become thoughts you can bat away, quicker and quicker each time.¬†

Find techniques like 'fast forward the tape' that work for you. I found 'urge surfing' really useful in my first two weeks. Delay, Distract, Decide is gold, too. Worth googling.

A change of environment works wonders. Go out for a drive or a walk or a coffee. Call a friend and get into talking about something else.

‚Ä¢ Know that it only take 10 days or so for alcohol to leave your body. Then it's not alcohol you're addicted to - it's the thought of it. It's the misconceptions you have about it. There is some de-brainwashing to do.

‚Ä¢ Be patient with yourself.¬†I used to say, 'I want to get sober quick, like in a movie montage'!¬†Hang on in there - while you've got to stay vigilant, it does get easier too.

Recognise that you want fast results. As drinkers, we're used to quick fixes. (I used to joke, ‚ÄòI downloaded the app, why do I still get pangs?!‚Äô) You'll look at the time gone by and wish you could leap forward to six months or a year and be done with it. Know that you will get there, even if you can't make the clock hands spin faster.

‚Ä¢ Lots of people who drink go from using-to-feel-happy to using-to-feel-nothing. I believe that long-term recovery is all about finding peace in other ways. Could be as simple as starting or re-starting a hobby, trying guided meditation. Or even changing jobs or addresses. The old cliche is true: it‚Äôs a change of lifestyle not a life sentence.

‚Ä¢ Books! A lot of people recommend This Naked Mind. However, I found a lot of brilliant practical advice in The 10 Day Alcohol Detox. Also, for  entertainment and empathy, The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober made me laugh and stay on track.

‚Ä¢¬†Keep your webcam and microphone off if you want to at first, but attend an online meeting. Doesn't have to be AA. There are lots of different types out there. Try a few. This will let you connect with others who 'get it'. Such a relief. And a reassurance knowing you can experience something and go back and tell them, and get understanding.

'The opposite of addiction is connection' didn't make sense to me at first. It does now.

‚Ä¢ Celebrate the wins. One day at a time - or even one hour at a time if you have to, at first. Count the days, the money saved (and use it to buy yourself treats), the calories if you like. Use an app on your phone.¬†iamdonedrinking.com¬†is good.¬†iamsober.com¬†also has communities of people at the same stage of recovery as you. One day... one week.. etc etc.

‚Ä¢ Don't be afraid to protect yourself; your recovery. Walk away if you need to. Go into another room or leave the building if a situation is not right for you. Your circle of friends may change a little. You will know that, 'You lie with dogs, you get fleas'!¬†

For the first year or so, I didn‚Äôt go out much, while I was finding my way. Now I turn up to some parties if there are new/good people there, get interested in them, join in fun conversations, etc ...but when things get too lairy I go - my time's too precious to be bored by pissed people :-)

‚Ä¢ Enjoy waking up without a hangover. Drive somewhere late at night. Explore doing stuff you couldn't before. As you heal, your attractions change too. Toxicity stops looking like excitement, peace stops looking like boredom.

‚Ä¢ Your sleep gets better. You‚Äôll gain more time in the day. These days I naturally wake and get up an hour before my alarm and read or do something else I want to before my workday begins - no hungover rush any more.

‚Ä¢ Complexion gets better. My face was puffy - it isn‚Äôt now. It‚Äôs easier to concentrate and communicate. Work‚Äôs easier. Relationships so, so much better.

‚Ä¢ Make a list of all the crap you had to put up with when you were a drinker. The hangovers, the zombie hours, blackouts? Sneakiness? All of it. Doesn‚Äôt apply any more. Keep a healthy memory of it (in other words, don't focus on regret but remember not to go back)

‚Ä¢ Use the extra time you gain. 'If only there were more hours in the day' - now there are! Get into something that you enjoy and absorbs you. Could be something you abandoned a while back, something you've always wanted to get round to doing, or something completely new. A hobby, a pastime ...and don't feel guilty for spending time on yourself.

‚Ä¢ Enjoy! Not having to drink any more feels so much better than any drink tastes. Enjoy your new life, remembering to glance over your shoulder occasionally so you don‚Äôt want to go back.

It's all about de-programming ourselves, I believe, and finding happier ways to live.¬†

It really does get easier, as your mindfulness and vigilance just become second nature, urges decrease, and you reap more and more benefits.

1jkz9f8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jkz9f8,Help us design this huge livingroom,"Hi! need help figuring out what to do with this huge space.   
We are 3 engineers and just moved into our first appartment in the city.   
the kitchen / livingroom is about 5m x 14.6m big.

The only furniture we have rn in the living room are the dining table (2mx1m) and the big couch (about 3.4m wide and 1.7m on the longer side).

we plan on moving the couch into the room a bit to create a corridor behind it to access the sliding door. we would also like a big rug under the couch but not sure about the size we need or the color to choose for it. an then maybe some big paintings on the wal behind the couch?? will also get a low sideboard for the tv.

we would also like to have something like a small coffee bar as one of us has a portafilter machine.

But what should we do with the rest of the walls? I do have a lot of plants, big and small, that i want to scatter around the room.

would love some inspiration on what to do with this awesome space. thanks!

1jkz537,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1jkz537/what_is_the_worlds_best_teeth_whitening/,What is the world's best teeth whitening?,"# The Search for the Best Teeth Whitening Option

Teeth whitening has always been a bit of a mystery to me. With so many products out there‚Äîstrips, toothpastes, gels, LED kits, even DIY home remedies‚Äîhow do you know which one actually works? I wanted **something effective but not ridiculously expensive** like professional whitening at the dentist.

After looking into different options, I kept seeing Laughland teeth whitening pop up in reviews. It‚Äôs **dentist-formulated, uses an LED mouthpiece, and claims to whiten teeth by 6+ shades in just a few days**. It sounded promising, so I decided to give it a try.

Here‚Äôs what happened after using it for a week.

# What‚Äôs Inside the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

The first thing I liked was how **simple and easy-to-use** the kit is. It includes:

* **Whitening Gel Pens** ‚Äì No messy trays or strips, just a precise applicator.
* **LED Mouthpiece** ‚Äì Helps activate the whitening gel for better results.
* **Straightforward Instructions** ‚Äì No overcomplicated steps.

The design looked way more professional than drugstore whitening kits, which gave me confidence that it might actually work.

# How I Used It

Each session takes **just 10 minutes**, so it didn‚Äôt feel like a hassle to fit into my day.

1. **Brushed my teeth and dried them** (so the gel sticks better).
2. **Applied the whitening gel** evenly using the pen applicator.
3. **Inserted the LED mouthpiece** and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinsed and cleaned** my mouth and the mouthpiece.

The gel had a mild, neutral taste‚Äî**no weird chemical flavor**, which was a relief.

# My Results After 6 Days

* **Day 1:** No immediate difference, but my teeth felt cleaner.
* **Day 3:** Noticed a small reduction in yellowing, especially at the edges.
* **Day 6:** My teeth were **visibly whiter‚Äîat least 6-7 shades brighter**.

The biggest surprise? **No pain or sensitivity.** I‚Äôve always had issues with whitening strips making my teeth hurt, but I had zero discomfort with this.

# How Does Laughland Compare to Other Whitening Methods?

* **Whitening Strips** ‚Äì Gave me uneven results and made my teeth feel sensitive.
* **Whitening Toothpaste** ‚Äì Good for maintenance, but doesn‚Äôt remove deep stains.
* **Professional Whitening** ‚Äì Probably the most effective, but way too expensive.

Laughland felt like a perfect balance‚Äîaffordable, effective, and no sensitivity issues.

# FAQs About Laughland Teeth Whitening

**1. Does it damage enamel?** ‚Äì No, the formula is designed to lift stains without harming your teeth.  
**2. Does it work on deep stains?** ‚Äì Yes, I saw noticeable improvement in coffee and tea stains.  
**3. How long do results last?** ‚Äì With good oral hygiene, results should last for months.

# Tips for Best Results

* **Use it daily** ‚Äì Skipping days slows down the whitening process.
* **Avoid coffee, tea, and wine** ‚Äì At least during the first week.
* **Brush and floss regularly** ‚Äì Helps keep your teeth looking bright longer.

# Final Thoughts ‚Äì Is Laughland the Best Teeth Whitening Kit?

For me, Laughland teeth whitening delivered real results without any pain or sensitivity. My teeth were noticeably whiter in less than a week, and I didn‚Äôt have to deal with the discomfort I got from strips.

Would it replace professional whitening? Maybe not for extreme cases, but for **an affordable, easy-to-use option that actually works**, it‚Äôs worth considering.

# Upgrade‚Äå Your Living Room: Best Round Wood Coffee Tables‚Äã 2025

The‚Äã Round ‚Å¢Wood Coffee Table is a versatile ‚Å£and‚Å¢ stylish furniture piece that serves as the centerpiece of any living room. A well-chosen ‚Äåcoffee‚Å§ table provides a functional surface for drinks, books, and decor, while also enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the space.With a ‚Äåwide variety of‚Å£ designs, materials, and ‚Äçfinishes available, finding ‚Äãthe perfect round wood coffee ‚Äãtable can be a daunting task.This guide‚Å¢ aims to simplify‚Äå the process‚Å£ by highlighting the best options for 2025, considering‚Å¢ factors like durability, style, and value.

[[Explore Top Rated round wood coffee table on Amazon.]](https://itsallgarden.com/baby-activity/?kw=round wood coffee table)

## Key Features Analysis

The‚Äå best round wood coffee ‚Å§tables ‚Å£for 2025 showcase a combination of innovative design, high-quality materials, and functional features.

**Solid Wood Construction:**

The Foundation of‚Äå any durable and long-lasting coffee table is it's construction‚Äå material.‚Å£ Solid wood,such as oak,maple,or ‚Äãwalnut,offers exceptional strength and stability. It‚Äç also provides a natural warmth ‚Äãand character‚Å§ that complements various decor styles. Look‚Å§ for tables with ‚Å§mortise-and-tenon joinery or dovetail‚Äå joints for added durability. ‚Å¢These construction methods ensure the table can withstand daily use and‚Å£ last for years.

**Diameter and Height:**

the Dimensions‚Å£ of the coffee table are ‚Äåcritical to its functionality and aesthetic appeal. ‚Å§A diameter‚Äå of‚Å§ 36 to 48 inches‚Äå is generally suitable for‚Å£ medium to large living rooms, while smaller spaces may benefit from a 30 to 36 inch diameter. ‚ÄåThe height should‚Äã be approximately the same as your sofa seat height,typically between 16 and‚Äã 20‚Å¢ inches. This ‚Äãensures pleasant access to ‚Äãitems placed on the table.**Finish ‚Å¢and Stain:**

The Finish of a ‚Äãround wood coffee table ‚Å¢not‚Å£ only protects the ‚Äåwood but also significantly influences its appearance. Options range from natural oil finishes that highlight the wood grain‚Å§ to painted finishes‚Å£ that add a pop‚Å¢ of color. Consider the existing furniture‚Å£ and decor in your living room when selecting‚Äç a finish. A ‚Å§stain that complements the‚Äç wood‚Äå tones in your sofa and other ‚Äçfurniture‚Äå pieces will create a cohesive and harmonious look.

**Storage Options:**

Some ‚Å¢Round‚Äå wood coffee tables offer built-in storage options, such as drawers, shelves, or hidden compartments. These ‚Äçfeatures can be incredibly useful for keeping‚Äå clutter at bay and‚Å£ maximizing space efficiency. Shelves are ideal for displaying books or magazines, while‚Å§ drawers can store remote controls, coasters, or other small items. ‚Å§A lift-top mechanism can‚Äç also provide a convenient surface for working or dining ‚Å¢while ‚Äãseated on the ‚Å§sofa.

**Leg‚Å¢ Design and Stability:**

The Leg design ‚Äåplays a crucial role in the coffee table's overall aesthetic and stability. Options range from‚Å¢ simple tapered legs to more‚Äã elaborate pedestal bases or hairpin legs. Ensure ‚Å¢that the ‚Äãlegs are‚Äç made ‚Äãof sturdy materials and securely attached to‚Å¢ the tabletop ‚Å¢to prevent wobbling or‚Äã instability. Consider the ‚Äåweight capacity of the table to ensure it ‚Äãcan‚Äå safely support the items you intend to place ‚Äçon it.

**Sustainability and Eco-Friendliness:**

Increasingly, ‚ÄãConsumers ‚Å§are prioritizing lasting and eco-kind ‚Äãfurniture options.Look ‚Äåfor round wood coffee‚Å§ tables made from responsibly sourced wood,‚Å£ such‚Äå as FSC-certified wood. Opt for finishes that are‚Å§ low-VOC (volatile organic compounds)‚Å¢ to minimize environmental impact and promote‚Å§ indoor‚Å¢ air quality. Some‚Äã manufacturers also use recycled materials or donate a portion of thier proceeds to environmental causes.

Key features of the best ‚Å§round‚Å§ wood coffee tables in 2025 include:

* ‚Å¢High-quality solid wood construction
* Optimal diameter and height for various living‚Å£ room sizes
* Durable and aesthetically pleasing finishes
* Integrated‚Äç storage options for organization

## FAQs Section

**What size round coffee table is‚Å§ best for my‚Å¢ living room?**

As a general rule, the coffee table should be approximately two-thirds the length of‚Å£ your sofa‚Å¢ and leave about ‚Å£18 inches of space between the table and the sofa.

Use coasters and placemats to protect the finish from spills and scratches. For deeper ‚Å§cleaning, use a ‚Å£wood cleaner specifically‚Å¢ designed ‚Äãfor the ‚Å¢type of finish on your table. avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive ‚Äãcleaners,‚Äç as these‚Äç can‚Å¢ damage‚Å¢ the wood.

**EXPLANATION**

place - my aunt loves nature, so wherever there are dense trees, plants, bushes, butterflies and chirping of birds, she would want to be there.

hobby - as i mentioned before, she does tarot readings. apart from that, her passions include painting and playing instruments (an artist + classical musician). she is also very enthusiastic about gardening.

season - nothing seems more perfect than sitting under a beautifully tinted tree of bright autumn leaves, enjoying the pleasant weather, the petrichor and having a cup of coffee.

hairstyle - cascade like, voluminous and a bit of ginger colour is her favourite.

outfit - just like me (we have similarities), she also prefers to wear classy and elegant apparels. trench coats and long skirts are her style.

favourite song - my aunt listens to (almost) every composition of yanni.

favourite animal - she likes stags because they are mysterious to her. some others include; cats, swan, squirrels, horses and all types of birds.

her type - johan liebert from monster (an anime). putting aside his negative characteristics, johan has quite the deadly charm. he speaks eloquently, dresses sophisticatedly, is well mannered and quick witted.",1,1743063306.0,MbtiTypeMe,1,1.0,False

Its advantages are compact size, space-saving, and easy-to-clean stainless steel surface. The downside is a maximum weighing capacity of only 5kg, which is not very high.

On AliExpress, there are many similar products. The top-performing one has an added timer function. It displays time alongside weight, just like on a Food Scale. This is clearly designed for coffee extraction and suits those with strict coffee-making requirements.

Broadening our horizons, modern Food Scales have become highly intelligent. Through BigSpy, we can see that a Food Scale displaying detailed nutritional info like calories and saturated fat is being heavily advertised.
