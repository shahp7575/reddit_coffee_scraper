One of the biggest shifts for me in overcoming long-term insomnia was realising that ‚Äúgood sleep‚Äù isn‚Äôt one-size-fits-all.

For years, I thought I had to follow rigid rules ‚Äî 8 hours every night, the perfect bedtime routine, never breaking the pattern. Some of those things worked for a couple of days, some made no difference, and others were so strict my tired mind just couldn‚Äôt keep them up. None of it gave me the lasting change I needed and wanted.

What finally worked was stepping back and asking: ***what does good sleep actually mean for me?*** 

Once I got clear on that, I could start building the sleep skills to make it happen consistently.

That‚Äôs what this space is about ‚Äî looking at the different parts of sleep and learning how to work with them in practical ways.

üí¨ When you imagine sleeping well consistently, what comes to mind for you?

  
‚Äì Falling asleep within 15‚Äì20 minutes and not lying awake for hours  
‚Äì Sleeping through the night without disturbances, or knowing how to get back to sleep quickly if you do wake  
‚Äì Waking up naturally, before the alarm, feeling refreshed and ready for the day  
‚Äì Having steady energy during the day, able to focus without relying on coffee or willpower  
‚Äì Feeling confident about bedtime, without the dread or pressure of ‚Äúwhat if I can‚Äôt sleep again tonight?‚Äù  
‚Äì Or perhaps something else entirely that matters most to you

Your definition of good sleep is the starting point for making it happen.

1nkchtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Post_Anything_/comments/1nkchtq/flat_bottom_pouch_a_smart_and_stylish_solution/,Flat Bottom Pouch: A Smart and Stylish Solution for Modern Packaging,"In the ever-evolving packaging industry, businesses are constantly searching for solutions that combine practicality, visual appeal, and sustainability. Among the many options available, the **flat bottom pouch** has gained remarkable popularity across industries such as food, coffee, pet supplies, and household products. Also referred to as a box pouch, this packaging format is designed with a reinforced flat base that allows it to stand upright securely, providing excellent shelf presence. Its combination of durability, efficiency, and versatility makes it one of the most reliable choices for both manufacturers and consumers. With growing demand for packaging that enhances functionality while reflecting eco-conscious values, the flat bottom pouch is proving to be a modern solution that addresses today‚Äôs market needs.

One of the key benefits of the [**flat bottom pouch**](https://mtpak.com/mtpak-standard-bag-style/flat-bottom-bag) **is its exceptional stability and storage capacity**. Unlike standard pouches that may collapse when not completely filled, the flat base provides strength and balance, allowing the pouch to stand tall and organized on shelves. This feature improves visibility in retail spaces, helping products catch the eye of shoppers in crowded aisles. The structured design also increases volume capacity, enabling businesses to package more product within the same footprint compared to traditional stand-up pouches. For consumers, this translates into greater convenience, as the pouch is easier to handle, pour from, and store at home. From coffee beans and snacks to dry pet food and nutritional supplements, the flat bottom pouch offers an ideal combination of practicality and presentation.

Another defining advantage of the **flat bottom pouch is its wide scope for customization and branding**. With five printable surfaces‚Äîfront, back, two sides, and the bottom panel‚Äîbrands have ample space to communicate their identity, values, and product information. This allows companies to maximize visual impact while maintaining a clean, professional look. Thanks to advanced printing methods such as digital and rotogravure, businesses can incorporate vibrant graphics, detailed illustrations, and high-resolution logos that elevate the customer‚Äôs first impression. Premium features such as matte or glossy finishes, metallic foiling, and transparent product windows can also be added to enhance attractiveness. For businesses competing in saturated markets, this level of customization makes the flat bottom pouch a valuable tool for building brand recognition and encouraging consumer loyalty.

Sustainability is another major factor fueling the rise of the **flat bottom pouch**. As consumers and regulators place increasing emphasis on reducing environmental impact, brands are expected to adopt packaging solutions that minimize waste and carbon emissions. Flat bottom pouches are inherently more eco-friendly than rigid packaging formats like jars, tins, and boxes, as they use significantly less material during production. Many manufacturers now provide recyclable, compostable, and biodegradable versions of these pouches, giving businesses the flexibility to align their packaging with eco-friendly goals. Additionally, the lightweight and space-efficient nature of the flat bottom pouch reduces shipping volume, lowering transportation costs and fuel consumption. By embracing flat bottom pouches, brands not only support global sustainability efforts but also appeal to eco-conscious customers who prioritize green packaging when making purchasing decisions.

Looking ahead, the **flat bottom pouch is expected to remain a key player in packaging innovation** as industries evolve to meet consumer demands for convenience, sustainability, and aesthetics. Emerging trends include the integration of resealable zippers, degassing valves for coffee, easy-tear notches, and QR codes for digital consumer engagement. Such features enhance usability while strengthening the overall customer experience. Furthermore, advances in digital printing make it possible for businesses of all sizes to access high-quality, customizable pouches without needing to order in massive quantities, reducing waste and costs. With its adaptability across diverse industries, eco-friendly advantages, and branding potential, the flat bottom pouch represents more than just packaging‚Äîit is a strategic tool that empowers businesses to thrive in competitive markets. As brands continue to embrace innovation and sustainability, the flat bottom pouch will remain a stylish, stable, and forward-thinking solution for years to come.",1,1758211767.0,Post_Anything_,0,1.0,False
1nkchrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nkchrf/electric_kettle_vs_stovetop_kettle_whats_the/,Electric kettle vs stovetop kettle: what's the difference?,"Hey everyone! I've been using both electric kettles and stovetop kettles for years, and I thought I'd share my experience to help those who are on the fence about which one to choose.

I recently switched to an electric kettle, and honestly, I wish I'd done it sooner. While my old stovetop kettle served me well, the convenience of an electric kettle is just unbeatable. Here's why:

First off, speed. My electric kettle boils water in about 3-4 minutes, while the stovetop version takes around 8-10 minutes. When I'm rushing to make my morning coffee or tea, those saved minutes really make a difference.

Energy efficiency is another big plus. Electric kettles use less energy because they heat the water directly. Stovetop kettles waste energy heating the stovetop first, then transferring that heat to the kettle. Plus, with electric kettles, you don't have to worry about forgetting the kettle on the stove (we've all been there, right?).

Safety features are a game-changer too. Most modern electric kettles automatically shut off when the water boils or if there's no water inside. I found some great options at https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle that have these safety features built-in.

Temperature control is another advantage. Many electric kettles let you choose specific temperatures, which is perfect for different types of tea or coffee. Green tea at 175¬∞F? No problem. French press coffee at 200¬∞F? Easy peasy.

But stovetop kettles aren't all bad. They're typically more durable and can last decades. They're also great during power outages, and some people (like my grandmother) swear the water tastes better from them.

The price difference isn't huge anymore. I recently got a fantastic electric kettle (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle) that was actually cheaper than some premium stovetop models.

Maintenance is pretty similar for both. You'll need to descale them occasionally, but electric kettles often have wider openings that make cleaning easier.

One downside of electric kettles is that they need an outlet, so you can't use them everywhere. Also, some cheaper models can be pretty noisy.

In terms of aesthetics, both types can look great in your kitchen. While traditional stovetop kettles have that classic charm, modern electric kettles come in sleek designs that can complement any kitchen style.

Bottom line? If convenience and speed are your priorities, go electric. If you're more traditional or want something that'll work during power outages, stick with stovetop. Either way, you can't go wrong - it really comes down to your lifestyle and preferences.

What's your experience with either type? I'd love to hear your thoughts!",1,1758211763.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

So avert your eyes if offended :)

**About Me**

I'm a U.S. neurosurgeon. I am technical but not a cracked SWE. I am convinced, in a non-oneshotted way, that AI is going to change how we access, pay for and regulate healthcare. And yet most healthcare AI is being built for legacy enterprise (AI scribes, RCM systems, computer assisted diagnoses, clinical decision support tools, etc.) Many of these will be moot in a few years as AI is directly used by patients.

  
And so I am focused on patient facing/empowering AI. 

I have the smallest ego of a neurosurgeon. I think I'm funnier than I am. I am easy to work with. I'm an introvert but certainly have enough charm to sell myself when needed. Hope it comes as no surprise as a neurosurgeon I am hard working. I am putting in about 15 - 20 hours a week onthis right now. I deal with conflict well. I listen and let go of my bad ideas pretty easy. I am high conviction though when I'm sure I'm right. In general I'm a good partner.

I'm older so not hanging out with cracked engineers. And not in a tech hub location. So finding a business partner is particularly difficult. I'm on YC co-founder matching and Coffee Space but want to try here as well.

  
**About The Company**

  
Think eventually AI doctors although that description sounds trite. AI doing physician knowledge work directly with patients. 

There are big players working in this space and even some startups that have raised. But I think this is a big space and it is early. Patient's first point of contact for routine outpatient healthcare in 10 years will mostly be AI. We have a challenging but realistic roadmap through the complex regulatory space with progressively less human in the loop. I have experience with the FDA process and even on a small scale with the lobbying and legislative work this eventually will take (although bigger players may help with this).

That roadmap includes revenue through the entire process; not build something and get it through regulatory pathway in three years and then start making money.

I have bootstrapped this so far and can do that for a while but eventually expansion and the regulatory process is going to necessitate raising and this being a VC play. I would anticipate getting an MVP out and some traction and trying to raise if the current fundraising environment doesn't collapse into an AI bubble before then.

  
We have a clunky user facing MVP which we could launch with. Between vibe coding, my shitty code and the numerous painful overshore devs that have come and gone there is realistically a lot of slop and technical debt. Just to make this sound exciting. Our provider/physician backend is yet to be. We're working on that off Medplum. But we could potentially launch prior to that.

  
This is a B2C health app play; on launch this is not enterprise. Getting consumers to health apps is challenging but I think we have a good go to market strategy and some creative ways of monetizing.

Our waitlists off Reddit and X posts is at 257 people.  

  
**What We Need**

I'm looking for a **US or Canadian based** technical co-founder. 

See below but potentially part time initially could definitely work.

Ideally full stack but probably more important is AI expertise. We're building off Crew with both open source foundation models and some medical models. But any agent platform experience. DSPy would be a plus. Experience with fine tuning, observability and guardrailing would be important. Currently guardrails ai modules and using a medical reward model but eventually human grading, etc.

Experience with medical data - FHIR/JSON - would be a huge, huge plus. 

I'm looking for someone to both code themselves and be a point of contact/manage overshore contract dev. Eventually on raising and hiring I'd want someone to serve as a real CTO managing engineers. 

I would continue bootstrapping this early and shoulder GTM and raising and the clinical side of design/domain expertise and continue to contribute dev wise if I wasn't making things worse with my code. Eventually I would lead getting us through the regulatory phase. 

I am looking for a partner who is collaborative and gives and takes feedback well. Who isn't an asshole. Who feels comfortable managing others. Who takes ownership and can identify tasks to be completed without handholding. Who works hard like I do. 

  
**What This Offers**

This could be totally an equity partnership and part time if someone could give similar to me (20 hours a week or more). In that case we'd aim for 50-50. Up for negotiation on how quickly with a collaboration trial to get to 50% equity. Totally negotiable at what raise or revenue level start drawing salary, at what raise or revenue level go full time, how the salary bumps at different levels, etc. 



Or this could be a salary (would not be up to market rates unfortunately; maybe 7-10k/month) + smaller equity (10 - 30%) that vests over time. Would expect full time (40+ hr/week) with salary. Again work trial and how quickly equity vests totally negotiable, as is levels at which salary bumps, etc. Would still expect this to evolve into a CTO role as we hire.

While I'm totally realistic about entrepreneurial success I 100% in on playing a part in AI in healthcare. I see this fundamentally changing my field. AI doctors will be a huge thing; I am certain of that as a doctor myself. And so the potential is certainly large.

Day 8-15: Started looking forward to the peaceful reading time, phone became less automatic Day 16-30: Haven't touched my phone before getting out of bed in two weeks

The key wasn't fighting the bad habit but creating a better system that made good habits more appealing and convenient. The wooden organizer I found on uncommon goods was crucial because it makes the whole setup feel intentional rather than just scattered stuff on my nightstand.

This year I went through a burnout, ended up quitting my job, and had to really step back to focus on my mental health. One of the things that helped me the most was simply acknowledging the *small positive things* that happened in a day. Even on the hardest days, there was usually something ‚Äî a nice coffee, a good conversation, a walk outside. We tend to ignore these things when we're not feeling well.

I‚Äôve been thinking about building a small app around this idea:

* A simple way to jot down the positive things that happened each day
* Maybe some gentle reminders to reflect and write something down
* A place to look back and see all those small wins stack up over time

Nothing too fancy, but something lightweight that helps people create the habit.

I‚Äôm curious ‚Äî would this be something you‚Äôd use? Or do you already do something similar (journaling, notes, etc.)?",1,1758211196.0,selfhelp,1,1.0,False

No questions, just get it done.

At my site we had a huge production facility where the title of god was second to the title of plant manager. But he made sure that billions of dollars worth pf goods got all over the country while dodging machines that can squish you and keeping thousands of union workers content and productive. He can have anything he wants, and was never outrageous.

Next door was a white collar building with a couple thousand engineers, office workers, and the like. One of senior white collar people thought he was more important than the plant manager, and needed the world to know it. This is his story.

Mr whatever was rarely at the site, spending most of his days coming in by 10, headed for the golf course by 1. Nobody knew what he did, but he was high up on the ladder.

About a month after he was assigned to the site there was a big announcement: he was getting a new private office with private bathroom and shower. About 50 cubicles were being ripped out to make space, so get packing.

After a month of construction, including extensive plumbing and cabling work, he stepped into his new office.

He came back out in seconds and told the facilities manager that this was unacceptable and he had to rip it out and start from scratch to make it right. Nothing specific, he just didn't like the style and layout.

Two months go by, he accepts his new office and proceeds to rarely visit it like there was no tomorrow.

In under a year he went somewhere else. Fired? Quit? Promoted? Nobody was sure. But we needed the space s9 the office was removed and about 50 cubicles put back in its place.

But because the plumbing was there, we got the only coffee maker in the building that would fill itself with water and had a drain. Everybody else had to carry pots of water to their machines like chumps.",3,1758211001.0,EntitledPeople,1,1.0,False

1nkc1hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1nkc1hf/explore_the_best_coffee_maker_for_singles/,Explore the Best Coffee Maker for Singles Technivorm Moccamaster Review,"Testing out the Technivorm Moccamaster 69212 for my daily coffee needs was honestly a blend of enjoyment and curiosity. As someone who religiously starts her day with a steaming cup of coffee, the idea of a single-serve machine designed to deliver an excellent brew felt incredibly promising. Known for its precision brewing process and hand-crafted build, this machine is built to satisfy those of us picky about their coffee. The polished silver design also adds a sleek aesthetic, making it a standout piece in any kitchen. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
One glance at the Technivorm Moccamaster 69212, and it‚Äôs clear that craftsmanship was a priority for the Dutch makers. Its compact dimensions‚Äî6.5"" deep, 10.2"" wide, and 11.7"" high‚Äîmake it perfect for small kitchens like mine, where counter space is at a premium. The metallic exterior is not only visually appealing but also feels incredibly sturdy. What caught my attention was the removable cup holder, allowing for different-sized mugs under the brew basket. This little touch makes it flexible for days when I‚Äôm feeling like a larger serving of coffee rather than the standard 10-ounce cup. Speaking of the cup size, the single-serve aspect ensured no wastage‚Äîa big plus for those watching their coffee bean usage.

**Ease of Operation**  
Using the coffee maker is surprisingly straightforward. The fully automatic operation with buttons ensures that even groggy mornings won‚Äôt make the brewing process frustrating. I especially appreciated the simplicity of the paper filter system. It‚Äôs light on the mess, easy to clean up, and makes the brew basket perfectly practical. The machine shuts off automatically after completing a brewing cycle, which was a relief when I forgot to turn it off a few mornings in a rush...Oops. 

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
This coffee machine lives up to its promise. Brewing a cup of coffee in under four minutes, the machine doesn‚Äôt just focus on speed; it does a terrific job of extracting flavor from the grounds. The steeping process delivers a rich, aromatic cup that caters to those who truly care about taste. I put it to the test with my preferred medium roast and was genuinely impressed with how it captured the nuanced flavors. The machine also maintains the brewed coffee at a perfect drinking temperature‚Äîno need to babysit it. 

[Check Technivorm Moccamaster 69212 price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b014i5owco/)

**Strengths**  
- Sleek and compact design, perfect for smaller spaces.  
- Removable cup holder accommodates different mug sizes.  
- Automatic shut-off for added convenience.  
- Excellent brewing process producing flavorful coffee without pods.  
- Simple paper filter system reduces mess and cleanup time.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The machine is manual in certain aspects, which might discourage those expecting a ""set and forget"" experience.  
- It is a single-serving coffee maker, so this isn‚Äôt ideal for larger households unless everyone‚Äôs fine waiting for their turn.  
- Compared to some high-end competitors, the price tag might feel hefty for what is essentially a one-cup machine.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing this coffee maker to options like the Keurig K-Mini and the Nespresso Essenza Mini, a few points stood out. The Keurig, for example, also offers compact functionality but leans heavily on pod usage, which may not appeal to environmentally-conscious consumers. The Nespresso version, on the other hand, delivers exceptional espresso but requires proprietary pods, again adding waste and cost over time. The Technivorm machine excels in offering a pod-free, eco-friendly, and flavor-focused brewing experience, specifically geared toward dedicated coffee drinkers.

**Best Value**  
While the initial investment is higher than some alternatives, what you‚Äôre really paying for is quality. The durability, flavor extraction, and reliability make this coffee maker stand out from generic budget models. Add to that the 5-year warranty, and you start to see where it delivers unmatched value. For committed coffee enthusiasts, this machine becomes a worthy kitchen companion. However, if you‚Äôre only an occasional coffee drinker, its features might feel a bit excessive.

1nkc0xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/1nkc0xl/pov_you_live_in_poland_where_43_of_households_own/,"POV: you live in Poland where 43% of households own dogs (rant about dating, public spaces, walks and remote work in a nutshell)","You cannot admit you don't like dogs here. It's a huge red flag. The closest thing to openly hating dogs is saying (to that confused friend after accidentally admitting you are not a huge fan of dogs) that you probably have some issues with yourself coz how mad one would have to be to not like dogs.

Anyway, after deciding that I won't date anyone with a dog - I realized how my dating scene just shrunk. That's not just dog owners that are gone from my scope. There is also the mindset that a man is just automatically more attractive once he is a dog lover or better a dog owner. Coz he is so loving and tender and you can just tell he is a good soul. And me? I'm the worthless, meanest and cruelest human being in the world coz I hate dogs.

For I admire the work of service dogs. But man, all of those Chihuahuas or sausage dogs...

Moving away from the path coz the massive unleashed dog (in the leash zone) can pass.

Leaving your fav coffee shop because a dog owers meet up with their little demons showed up.

Owners letting their dogs (whitout asking) sniff other people on the street. Coz why not.

And my final thought.

Remote work is great - until half of your block of flats in the area owns dogs. Dogs that do like to ""chat"" with each other when the owners are gone to work. No one to mind them, just one constant woof as if the inner wolf woke up for the full moon.

Or am I delusinal? Im a chill dude but man those dogs. Will it pass? Did anyone got over that mad hate towards dogs?",13,1758210723.0,Dogfree,4,1.0,False
1nkc07a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1nkc07a/explore_tide_liquid_detergent_with_oxi_boost_does/,Explore Tide Liquid Detergent with Oxi Boost Does It Really Work,"Testing out the Tide Ultra Oxi Boost Liquid Laundry Detergent, model ""80740239,"" has been a part of my weekly laundry routine, and I‚Äôve got a lot to share. At first glance, this isn‚Äôt just your average liquid laundry detergent; it‚Äôs a powerhouse that promises to tackle tough stains while keeping clothes vibrant and fresh. Over several weeks of use, I‚Äôve run it through all kinds of laundry situations, from sweaty gym clothes to delicate fabrics, and here‚Äôs the scoop.

**Exceptional Cleaning Performance**  
The cleaning power here truly stands out. With its built-in pre-treaters, I noticed that even stubborn stains like coffee spills and mud marks vanished on the first wash. It made my life easier during hectic mornings when pre-treating individual stains wasn't an option. The combination of Tide Power and Ultra OXI really lives up to its name, and it works beautifully on both whites and colors. It's been a relief to not have clothes show those faint remnants of stains after washing.

**Odor Elimination at Its Best**  
Every laundry detergent promises cleaner clothes, but not all of them tackle odors as effectively as this one. I‚Äôve got a teenager at home who plays sports, and his gym uniforms are not for the faint-hearted. This detergent not only removed the dirt but also tackled the set-in odors that seem impossible to get rid of. The fresh scent it leaves behind is subtle yet noticeable, giving that just-washed freshness without feeling overpowering.  

**Built-In Pre-Treaters Save Effort**  
What really sold me initially was the promise of pre-treating features built into the formula. Of course, I was skeptical; I mean, how much can a detergent do on its own? But this one really surprised me. Old stains on my kitchen towels disappeared, and I didn‚Äôt have to spend extra time dabbing them with stain removers before washing. It's a definite time-saver for busy households.

[Check Tide Ultra Oxi Boost 80740239 deals on Amazon now.](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b0bnwf9ypl/)

**Ease of Use and Formula Concentration**  
This product comes in a concentrated formula, which means a little goes a long way. That, for me, translates to fewer environmental concerns and good value‚Äîless water, more active ingredients, and still enough power to handle weeks' worth of laundry. Measuring the detergent for the perfect load size was straightforward thanks to the clear instructions on the bottle, and there were no issues with residues left behind in the washer.

**Boons**  
- Easily tackles tough stains without pre-treating.  
- Efficient odor removal for set-in smells.  
- Concentrated formula with more cleaning agents in every drop.  

**Critiques**  
- The packaging can feel bulky, especially if you‚Äôve got limited storage space in the laundry room.  
- The cap, while functional, could use some improvements to avoid spills when pouring.  
- Some people may find the scent too mild if they prefer stronger fragrances in their detergent.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to some rivals, like Persil ProClean or Arm & Hammer Plus OxiClean, this liquid laundry detergent holds its own in terms of stain removal and freshness. In fact, I‚Äôd argue it outperforms them for deeply set odors, although Persil offers a slightly stronger scent. Arm & Hammer gives it competition with affordability, but I‚Äôve found Tide leaves clothes feeling less stiff over repeated washes. The pre-treater feature also gives this product an edge, as it means fewer steps in the laundry process. 

**Cost Efficiency**  
For a detergent with such robust features, the initial cost may seem like a splurge. However, the effective concentrated formula ensures you use less detergent per load, stretching its value far beyond cheaper alternatives. Plus, the hassle-free cleaning it provides cuts down on the need to rewash stained clothes or invest in additional stain removers. For busy families or anyone chasing efficiency, this is one of those cases where spending a few extra dollars feels completely justifiable.

I don‚Äôt dream about gold and silver anymore.

Instead I dream about left over lives I didn‚Äôt get a chance to experience except in repeat like old shows on a tv at my grandmas house.

The days pass with not much more then a few cups of coffee and cigarettes stumped out when I open my eyes.

Complacency my companion a convent pet that sits in the conners and only echos my thoughts back at me.

I sat alone in myself, placed among structures out of control and set adrift by outbound strife. 

No longer uplifted, then falling. 

I had landed solid and finite. 

This time my soul was not present; the light had gone out like the hour when the sun fades and darkness enfolds the land. 

A wandering shell that keeps living after the love is gone. 

Running scared down alleys, looking up while I‚Äôm yelled at about where to go. 

I duck and hide, only to have a voice behind me say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stop walking.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm wound back to where the window falls out and fire raged at a time forgotten by any living person. 

It smells deep, like copper at the top of the church, with a hint of sadness. 

The hidden door conceals a library from before this land was governed. 

That voice, when I think, no longer has much to say.

If I had said it was okay, would you have started to believe in me again? 

It‚Äôs been so long that we forgot how it looked and felt to be home. 

Is this home? 

Where had I been- outside in the air, or somewhere within your mind, still the same, just a memory, I suppose. 

Too close to treason; perhaps it should have been forgotten. 

As it stands now: someplace between living and dreaming. 

The d√©j√† vu: a vanguard of reflections, awash with the dizzy familiarity of knowing we‚Äôve been here before. 

As I look in the mirror I see myself-my face- but it‚Äôs not who I am.

Study plan? My general day included 80-100 questions (40 UW random, 40-60 Amboss systems-based), 3-5 hours of content review (First Aid, Master the Boards, and Step Up to Medicine), Amboss 30 topics in 30 days (1-2 topics), Amboss 200 HY concepts (1-2 topics based on content topic), and Anki incorrects (which got way out of hand after week 3). Most of my days were 10 am to 1 am, with a 1 hour lunch break, 1 hour gym break, and 2 hour dinner break (although, I admit I skipped dinner \~3 days a week to keep studying). The one full day I had off during the entire month was during my brother's surgery, but otherwise I only took Wednesday evenings off at 8pm to watch TSITP. My last 3-4 days of studying after NBME 14 were hell; I think I did 160-200 questions of dedicated content review on my weakest topics, caught up on the thousands of Anki cards, skipped the gym, breakfast, and dinner, and slept <4 hours.

\---

Test day? It was a mess. I was sick the night prior from food poisoning. For breakfast, I unknowingly ate something with dairy and had to make a last minute lactaid run lol. I got to the testing center late because it was a school zone. I printed the wrong scheduling permit. I didn't finish blocks 2-3 on time. The girl next to me was arguing with the proctor for 7-8 minutes before she finally agreed to leave. As bad as the external factors were, I leaned into these mantras: ""You can do the hard things. You got into med school against all odds and survived third year. You cared for patients who loved you, and now you get to do that for the rest of your life. These questions are your patients, they're not intimidating -- what would you do if you were sittiing across from them in the ER right now? Each new question, each new set, each new vignette is an opportunity to show everyone -- who doubted you, who believed in you, who cheered you on -- exactly what you're capable of. BE THAT B\*TCH.""

\---

Takeaways? Dedicated was kinda miserable and isolating, but I found joy in the routine and really leaned into my support system. I was grateful to finally go to the gym in the afternoon when it was empty. I was happy to share meals with my husband again. I had one friend to keep me accountable, whether that was meeting at a coffee shop, on campus, or simply getting on Zoom. She was the best thing about dedicated because as lonely as I was, I knew she was with me.

My last piece of advice is trust yourself. When you sit for the exam, it's the not the time to let self-doubt prevent you from giving your best. You cried and prayed to get here today.

The first happened around 7 PM. I was outside playing with my friends, and as we ran past our house, I saw something that made me stop. There was a shadowy figure standing at our front door, knocking. It wasn‚Äôt frantic or threatening just calmly knocking, as if it belonged there. I told my friends what I saw, but they brushed it off and kept playing.

The second time was even stranger. I was in a room with my mom while she was ironing clothes. The door was open, and from where I sat, I had a clear view of the living room. That‚Äôs when I saw it again a shadow, standing beside the sink. What unsettled me was how familiar it looked.

TLDR: my ex has got back in touch with me whilst I am going through marriage issues/breakup, and she has indicated similar with her own marriage - what do I do?

My wife (F/30) and I (M/31) have been together for 8 years, married 2021, bought a house in 2022, and we have a little daughter.

Unfortunately though the marriage has broken down over time. Especially since Autumn 2024 when she started saying she wants a divorce and for me to move back to my hometown. This began when I lost trust in her completely due to financial issues she‚Äôs continually got us into, without letting me know or talking to me about them (started in 2019 and we‚Äôre still dealing with her debts now). She‚Äôs also been emotionally and physically abusive, including infront of our daughter earlier this year. For me, that‚Äôs been the line crossed and I‚Äôm now exploring options for us to separate. She doesn‚Äôt want this, but is aware of it. 

However, the main point is a crazy coincidence alongside this - My ex girlfriend (F/30) from 9 years ago got back in touch with me in April this year. 

First she sent an Insta follow request, which I ignored out of respect for my marriage. But then she followed up with a Facebook friend request in June. I was curious, mainly thinking something might be up - she could be seriously ill or something. So I messaged her to check if she was ok.

(Side note for context: my ex and I never properly split up. We were fairly long distance, she started her degree and I started a full time job straight after uni. We drifted apart due to lack of time and insecurities/trust broke down due to this and the distance. We last met in late 2016 but soon after removed each other off social media and got into different relationships in 2017 - mine being with my current wife).

Since I messaged her we‚Äôve been talking daily since then, for the past 3 months. Very friendly and fun chat, reminiscing and sharing memories and old photos from when we were together. There‚Äôs been compliments and signs we‚Äôre still attracted to each other too. It‚Äôs very similar to the kind of chat you have with someone when you start dating - getting to know each other. She‚Äôs said a number of other things which make me think she still has feelings for me and wants more too: ‚Äúyou still have a special place in my heart‚Äù, indicating she‚Äôd rather spent time with me than her husband, comparing me to her Dad who she loved more than anyone else. There‚Äôs been a lot more that I can‚Äôt remember off the top of my head too.

On top of this, she suggested to meet for a catch up. This is a lot easier than it used to be as my job involves a lot of travelling, including near where she lives. So I took her up on it. 

We met twice a few weeks ago, first for a walk on her lunch break, then for a coffee and food the following day. It was just as friends, but to me anyway it felt like the connection was still very much there. In fact, I realised that I was still in love with her after all this time. Even deeper, the truth is I‚Äôve never really gotten over her and have thought about her constantly over the past 9 years. That‚Äôs a hard truth for me to admit, especially in the context of my marriage. 

Towards the end of our 2nd time meeting up I decided I trusted my ex enough to open up to her about the situation with my wife, that we‚Äôre effectively in the long process of separating, and that I still have very strong feelings for her (my ex). 

At the time she seemed quite emotional (acting shy and a bit teary), and she then opened up about her own marriage and me, key points being:
- she‚Äôs been looking me up on social media a lot over the years.
- she was excited that I contacted her back, and gets excited every time I message her.
- her husband left her for someone else a few years ago but they got back together.
- her husband has also been messaging other girls in the past, beyond just friends.
- their marriage was rushed, only deciding in Dec 2024 to then get married in March 25.
- her husband has simply responded with ‚Äúthanks‚Äù when she tells him she loves him.
- her husband never compliments her.

She then said she‚Äôd follow up with her own message back to me about how she feels. Two weeks later she sent me this message. Though, in summary, the message was that despite her still having feelings for me and still wanting to talk to me and meet me, we can only be friends as she loves her husband, at least whilst they are going through couples therapy to try and make it all work. Even then if they did split up, she‚Äôd need time to mourn her marriage. I was a little upset and confused, give everything she‚Äôs said, but I thought that‚Äôs fair enough. 

Still, since then she‚Äôs hinted again that she‚Äôs still attracted to me and wants to go for drinks next time we meet. She‚Äôs currently on her honeymoon now, and I‚Äôve said to her that we shouldn‚Äôt text each other whilst she‚Äôs there with her husband (especially in case he catches her texting me)- which she has since kept to so far. I also suggested this as I think it‚Äôs important for her to spend that time with her husband without having me ‚Äòon the side‚Äô, to see how she really feels about him.

I should also confirm, neither her husband nor my wife know that we are messaging each other like this, or even that we‚Äôve met up.

But I guess my question after all this is - what the do I do from now? I‚Äôm thinking I just take a step back and wait for her to sort things out with her husband and accept whatever outcome.

What does this all sound like overall too though - is she messing me around?",1,1758210028.0,relationships,2,1.0,False
1nkbo6w,https://youtu.be/dXcwcbYOP04,What I learned making my debut feature on a ¬£13k budget (with trailer),"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve just released the trailer for my debut feature Premature, a Glasgow-set romantic comedy about two flatmates who wind up pregnant after a one-night stand.

I wanted to share a bit about how we made it and what I learned, in case it‚Äôs useful for anyone else working on micro-budget projects:

**Development & Writing**

I started writing the film in the summer of 2024. Initially, I planned to raise private equity to finance the film, but I decided it was unlikely that anyone would want to invest in a first-time feature director. So I started saving instead.

I paid for coverage from The Black List and ScreenCraft to see if the script was strong enough to justify spending the next few years of my life making it, and I also got notes from filmmaker friends. You might argue that money spent on coverage services could have gone into the production budget, but I stand by the decision. The feedback was honest and, even if I didn‚Äôt action every note, it made the script much stronger.

At its longest, the script was 100 pages long, but I couldn‚Äôt afford to shoot that many pages. I cut scenes, combined scenes, and merged characters. Before we started shooting, I got it down to 89 pages, and by then I had written about 17 drafts. As I was wearing multiple hats, having the script locked and solid before we started shooting allowed me to focus on the task at hand: making the film.

**Budget & Schedule**

The film was self-financed with a production budget of around ¬£13,000. We shot over 22.5 days with a core cast and crew of 5: two actors, a cinematographer, a camera assistant, and a boom operator. Having a small crew meant we could afford to shoot for more days. It also meant we built a strong rapport and the energy on the set was consistently positive.

Along the way, we were joined by a wonderful group of supporting actors, background actors, additional crew, and production assistants. Everyone had a blast and a bunch of people offered to come back to help whenever they could. Of course, extra bodies meant extra catering costs, so I went over budget there. Whether it was coffee in the morning or ice cream at lunch, little treats throughout the day kept morale high. Totally worth it.

**Camera & Lenses**

We shot on my Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K Pro with Samyang VDSLR primes and a ¬º Black Pro-Mist filter. The 24mm and 50mm did most of the heavy lifting, with occasional use of the 14mm, 35mm, and 135mm.¬†

As much as I would have liked to shoot on an Alexa with nice glass, I don‚Äôt think it would have made a huge difference. I would still be in the one behind the camera ‚Äì blocking and framing the shots ‚Äì in the same locations with the same lighting setup. I couldn‚Äôt afford kit rental anyway! The best camera is the one you can afford to buy, rent, or borrow.

Apart from the occasional push in on a dolly/slider, the film was shot handheld or on sticks. I mostly pulled my own focus; I wish I could have afforded a 1^(st)¬†AC for the entire shoot.

We acquired in 6K, BRAW, and I‚Äôm editing in 4K. Probably overkill.

**Lighting**

For daytime exteriors I leaned heavily on natural light, using bounce, diffusion, and negative fill. I tried to schedule the exteriors so the sun would backlight the actors, but it wasn‚Äôt always possible.¬†

Interiors were covered with a small lighting package (2x Neewer CB300B, 1x Godox FL150S, 2x LED tubes, 2x small magnetic LEDs), supported by practicals. My approach to lighting was to keep things as simple as possible, often opting for a single source which I would bounce and cut.

For example, I lit one scene using the ceiling fixture that was already at the location. I spent ages in prep worrying about how I was going to light the scene, but the solution was the simple. All I needed was a bit of black wrap to control the spill and a polyboard for some fill.

**Locations**

Most of our locations were sourced through friends, family, and colleagues. However, we had to hire several key locations that were crucial to the story, including a museum, a hospital, and an ultrasound clinic. It would have been easier and cheaper to write a script utilising locations I could access for free, but I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to tell the story I wanted to tell.

**Next Steps**

The film is assembled and I‚Äôm working on the rough cut. We‚Äôre crowdfunding to raise funds for colour grading, sound design, and music, with the goal of beginning festival submissions in spring 2026.",6,1758209943.0,Filmmakers,5,0.88,False

Here‚Äôs why:

Credibility ‚Äì When someone Googles your business, a professional site makes you look more established than just a Facebook or Instagram page.

Control ‚Äì You own your site, not the algorithm. You decide how your business is represented.

Search Visibility ‚Äì A properly set up site can get you showing up in local Google searches (think ‚Äúcoffee shop near me‚Äù).

24/7 Availability ‚Äì Your site works for you around the clock‚Äîanswering questions, showing off your products/services, or taking bookings.

First Impressions ‚Äì A well-designed site can instantly build trust and get someone to reach out instead of scrolling past.


I work with small businesses (mostly through WordPress) to get their websites up and running, and many of them have told me it‚Äôs boosted both their sales and customer engagement. It doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive or complicated to make a real difference.

We‚Äôve been together for 10 years and are each other‚Äôs first serious relationship and first sexual partner.

Six months ago, she lied to me and spent 4 days in a hotel with another man. She insists nothing happened between them, but admitted she hid it because it would have been ‚Äútoo hard to explain.‚Äù Even before this, she sometimes left out details about seeing him (like saying she went for coffee but not mentioning going to the movies).

That broke my trust, and we‚Äôre still struggling to recover. Three weeks later, I was mobilized into the army. I‚Äôm not on the frontlines but in a support role, so we don‚Äôt see each other every day anymore. That distance makes it even harder.

Her personality: she‚Äôs quiet, modest, reserved, and rarely takes initiative in everyday life, our relationship, or intimacy. She often doubts her value and puts herself down, though she is reliable and supportive in tough moments. She‚Äôs attractive, but very insecure about her appearance and tends to focus on flaws.

I‚Äôm more initiative-driven, though also introverted. Almost everything in our life has been pushed forward by me‚Äîmoving, traveling, career changes (including hers), and our intimacy. She supports me but rarely starts things on her own.

I‚Äôll admit I used to be controlling. I tracked where she was, checked her expenses, even her search history. After the hotel situation, I confessed this and cut off every way of monitoring her. Sometimes I regret it.

I‚Äôve also lied to her‚Äîmostly small lies to cover chaotic situations, then covering one lie with another. Usually, I would eventually confess. I think I have some narcissistic tendencies, maybe a 5 out of 10 if I had to rate it.

Since the betrayal, deeper problems have surfaced. I feel like she doesn‚Äôt truly desire me. She almost never initiates intimacy. When I suggest something new, she refuses. I even ask her directly, ‚ÄúWhat do¬†*you*¬†want?‚Äù but she shrugs it off. She avoids things that matter to me (like doing a photoshoot I asked for). In intimacy, she‚Äôs passive. I try to create space for her to express herself, but she doesn‚Äôt take it.

Sometimes I fear it‚Äôs not just incompatibility, but me‚Äîthat maybe with someone else she would be more open, more confident, more alive. That thought eats away at me.

There was also a time when she didn‚Äôt want to sleep in the same bed with me. That was devastating, because physical closeness is very important to me. Even now, she usually goes to bed later, so I fall asleep alone. It feels lonely. When she‚Äôs not around, I get intrusive thoughts‚Äîimagining she‚Äôs messaging him or still in contact. I have no proof, and she says it‚Äôs nonsense, but my mind runs wild.

Lately, I‚Äôve also become more irritable. Before the army, I worked from home and always cooked and kept the place clean. Now, when I come back and the apartment is messy or the bed is unmade, I get frustrated‚Äîeven though she works 6 days a week and has little time. She does cook, but if I complain about cleaning, she gets upset. I also dislike that she often drinks in the evenings. Sometimes it feels like I‚Äôm just searching for reasons to leave.

At the same time, I can‚Äôt imagine life without her. Other women catch my interest now, but when I picture walking into our apartment without her, or imagine her as a mother one day with someone else, it tears me apart. I also feel responsible for her. If we break up, even mutually, I‚Äôll feel like I abandoned her.

The divorce talks have become constant. Almost every night we end up discussing it, draining each other, and then in the morning things calm down‚Äîuntil it repeats. We still have intimacy, but it‚Äôs always my initiative, and it feels like she‚Äôs just going along with it.

She often says I don‚Äôt really listen. For years she wanted to go on a simple trip into the forest, and I always brushed it off. She says I only focus on my pain, not hers. And honestly, I‚Äôve lied to her far more than she has to me, even if my lies were about small things. She‚Äôs begged me to let go of what happened with the other man, but I can‚Äôt.

I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist to work on myself. She refuses therapy, either individually or as a couple. So right now, the effort is one-sided.

The truth is, we‚Äôre both terrified of losing each other. But we‚Äôre also draining each other dry in the process.

TL;DR

30M/30F, together 10 years, first relationship for both. Six months ago she lied about spending 4 days in a hotel with another man. Since then, trust has been broken and deeper issues surfaced ‚Äî she rarely takes initiative in our relationship or intimacy, I feel undesired, and I‚Äôm becoming more irritable and distant. We talk about divorce almost every night but are both terrified of losing each other. I‚Äôm in therapy, she refuses. I don‚Äôt know if I should keep fighting for this or let go after 10 years.",4,1758209256.0,marriageadvice,17,1.0,False

It seems like we can't go out without having to spend money. We like to get coffee together or dinners out when the week has been stressful, it's hard to think of things we can do that don't cost money. People say just go on a picnic but that requires us to have to buy picnic foods. We go wander stores but we always end up picking up small thigns we need for the house. We're REALLY trying to cut back on spending and it just feels impossible, especially with all the things we can say are needs and all the things that are just small things to make us feel better or in the middle of enjoying a day. 

I would love all the help & advice for people who have seriously cut back their spending so they could focus on savings or just cutting back in general. ",2,1758208825.0,SavingMoney,5,1.0,False

I am a first-year MPH/MPA student interested in securing a healthcare consulting (or at least program evaluation-adjacent) internship for my summer practicum. I joined a healthcare consulting organization at my university, where MHA students informed me that it is challenging for MPH students to secure consulting opportunities. So, here I am. I need fine-tuning and advice on how I can make my resume stand out in the vast applicant pool. I have a resume bank, but I've highlighted the experiences I believe are most relevant and quantifiable. I plan to use this as a consulting internship-based resume, adapting it for each role as needed.

I started my graduate program straight after undergrad, so I am working with what experience I have. Although not all of my roles align with consulting (I recently decided that this is the career path I want to pursue), I tried my best to quantify my experiences and incorporate consulting buzzwords. I also added an ""interests"" section based on advice from a resume workshop, but I am not too sure how I feel about it.

Honestly, I am open to anything. I am interested in working with bigger firms (eg: Premier is one I am very interested in), or smaller boutique firms. I am also open to relocating for the summer or doing remote work. In a perfect world, a position where I can stay where I live now (the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill triangle area) or work in Houston (where my family lives) would be great for financial reasons. But like I said, I am not opposed to relocating. My only requirement is that it is a paid position since I am paying for grad school myself.

Thrice in the past week I've watched co-workers making social plans while I'm sitting at the same table as they are.  No eye contact was made.

1nkb0eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1nkb0eh/explore_if_sanix_disinfectant_wipes_truly/,Explore If SaniX Disinfectant Wipes Truly Eliminate 99 Percent Germs,"Testing out the Klaines KL-SX-W80-8 for the past few weeks, I can confidently say these disinfectant wipes have become a staple in my daily cleaning routine. As a parent with two energetic kids, a dog, and a seemingly endless number of messes, finding cleaning products that are effective yet user-friendly is no small task. These wipes, however, surprised me with their versatility and dependability. 

I first put these wipes to the test after a particularly messy dinner involving spaghetti, which somehow ended up more on the table and chairs than in our mouths. Grabbing a wipe, I noticed it was generously pre-moistened, sturdy in texture, and had just the right size to handle spills and stains. It didn‚Äôt take long for me to realize their potential for tackling tough messes while leaving behind a pleasant clean scent. Given that they‚Äôre designed to eliminate 99.9% of bacteria and viruses, including Human Coronavirus and Influenza A, I felt reassured knowing these high-touch surfaces were genuinely disinfected.

**Positives**

- EPA List-N registered, ensuring it kills harmful bacteria and viruses effectively.  
- Advanced bacteriostatic formula keeps surfaces protected against odor-causing bacteria for up to 15 days.  
- Offers four functions in one wipe‚Äîcleaning, disinfecting, sanitizing, and deodorizing.  
- Handy for removing a variety of stains, including coffee, wine, grease, and even blood stains.  
- Sturdy and durable wipes that don‚Äôt tear easily, even on rough surfaces.

I particularly appreciated how thoughtfully these were designed for both home and professional use. Bathroom countertops, kitchen surfaces, the fridge handle‚Äîjust about every non-porous surface in my house‚Äîwere left sparkling clean with no streaks or overwhelming chemical smell. A feature worth noting is these wipes‚Äô ability to control odors. Our dog‚Äôs favorite spot on the couch often has lingering smells, but using one of these on the fabric completely neutralized the odor, to my delight.

**Disadvantages**

Despite the many merits, a few things caught my attention as worth noting:  
- While the wipes are robust, the size might feel a tad small for handling larger surfaces like countertops in one go.  
- Some individuals might prefer a stronger scent to reinforce the feel of cleanliness, though I personally enjoyed the subtleness.

Another scenario where these wipes pulled their weight was cleaning up after crafting with my kids. Crayon marks on the dining table seemed like a nightmare to clean, but these wipes were surprisingly effective. Knowing that they actively deodorize while cleaning gave me peace of mind that surfaces were sanitized and odor-free for an extended period.

**Competitors**

If you‚Äôve been considering other cleaning products in this category, brands like Lysol or Clorox may come to mind. Compared to Clorox wipes, the Klaines KL-SX-W80-8 offers longer bacteriostatic protection, up to 15 days, which is a huge selling point for me as someone who‚Äôs always pressed for time. Lysol wipes are known for their vivid lemon fragrance, but I found the more neutral scent of these wipes less overwhelming. Both competing options are effective in killing viruses and bacteria, but Klaines excels by incorporating a solid deodorizing feature that lasts longer and feels more comprehensive.

[Grab Klaines KL-SX-W80-8 at the best price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b09rsg2mtl/)

**Value for Money**

Are they worth the investment? Considering their superior cleaning power, combined functions, and extended bacteriostatic protection, I genuinely believe these wipes offer excellent value for the price. Many products promise a lot but fall short in execution. That doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case here. The combination of a thoughtfully crafted product that simplifies tasks and promotes a healthier space makes it stand out.

May and the band sing enthusiastically along with the radio.

May whips around onto Whitehall Road. The old church, which has never been a church, on one side, the baseball field on the other. Past a junk yard full of old Earth vehicles. Earth and Rycacian flora mixes here, growing over every surface that isn't constantly maintained. 

As they pull onto the road that leads up the hill to the radio station, the music ends and a DJ comes on. 

‚ÄúHey there, babies. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶two thirty pm and no, you have not entered the Twilight zone. That‚Äôs right, babies, I‚Äôm here on day shift, the light is too bright, the sun is too hot, I‚Äôm running on six gallons of coffee, a wing and a prayer, but I‚Äôm here with you. And I‚Äôm not the only one, babies, we got a band on the way. Exclusive interviews and maybe a little music. I‚Äôm Junie-Junebug, and you are listening to Hangdog City Radio.‚Äù

JJ is on the air, waves at May through the booth but can‚Äôt talk. She starts up a standard interview, talks to them for awhile. 

May, Rahal, and Diesel are temporarily left on their own. May takes Rahal over to the motel. 

There is a human in the office. She looks up at them, shakes her head. 

‚ÄúFull up, sorry.‚Äù She says. 

‚ÄúBullshit.‚Äù May says. ‚ÄúBesides, we‚Äôre over at Mama's house. How you been?‚Äù

‚ÄúKeep on keeping on.‚Äù She says. ‚ÄúThis your girlfriend?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe wishes. Rahal, Kay.‚Äù May motions. ‚ÄúYou know anything about all this‚Ä¶ Marasat shit going on with the radio?‚Äù

‚ÄúBeats the fuck out of me.‚Äù Kay says. ‚ÄúI just work here, man, nobody tells me shit.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about JJ? They tell her anything?‚Äù May asks. 

Kay runs a hand through her hair. ‚ÄúI dunno, maybe. She‚Äôs in tight with them, they're up at that place all the time. You know how they are, though, you start asking questions and they clam up.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr they just really don‚Äôt know.‚Äù May says. 

‚ÄúMaybe not.‚Äù Kay shrugs. ‚ÄúEither way, kinda pointless.‚Äù

Dusty is saying ok, they'll play a couple songs. The band echoes through the radio a minute later.

JJ has stepped out into the parking lot and is squinting in the daylight. She waves as May and Rahal approach, hugs May when they get there. 

‚ÄúI heard you were coming by, I didn't know you were with them again!‚Äù JJ says. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on official duty.‚Äù May says. 

‚ÄúUh-huh.‚Äù JJ smirks. 

‚ÄúShut up, we actually are.‚Äù May says. ‚ÄúThere's some weird Marasat shit going on.‚Äù

JJ groans. ‚ÄúOh, I know. They've been all over the place up here the last few days. Heard there are about a million new towers that have gone up for whatever damn reason.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHey, is April still around?‚Äù May asks.

‚ÄúDown on the farm.‚Äù JJ says. ‚ÄúSame as always.‚Äù

‚ÄúSweet.‚Äù May says. ‚ÄúHey, Rahal, you ever seen a horse?‚Äù

They walk down the hill to a farm, another place that looks plucked from some old movie, complete with grass and oak trees. A few horses are out in the pasture. 

April meets them on the porch, hugs May, who makes introductions. 

They make small talk for a few minutes, then May casually asks ‚ÄúAny of those horses rideable?‚Äù 

Rahal makes a choking sound. 

‚ÄúYeller there is dead broke, that little bay is green, that black one is the goddamn devil.‚Äù April says. 

‚ÄúSo, all of them.‚Äù May laughs. 

‚ÄúYeah, except for‚Ä¶‚Äù April scans the pasture. ‚ÄúThere she is, way over there. Princess. She‚Äôs trained to ride but she‚Ä¶prefers to be left alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can't ride a horse.‚Äù Rahal says flatly. 

‚ÄúWell, not in those shoes, for sure.‚Äù May says. ‚ÄúBesides, we don‚Äôt have time right now.‚Äù

The radio, playing from inside the house, has switched from music to JJ talking again. Wrap it up, time to go. 

‚Ä¶

While the humans are off doing, whatever it is humans do, Diesel unsuccessfully attempts to pick a Marasat‚Äôs brain about the towers. 

They just keep saying it‚Äôs to boost the signal, and either can't or won't clarify farther. 

Something weird happened last night. Diesel isn't sure what it was, but Dad is jumping at shadows and May had her cop face on most of the morning. 

The Marasats are all worked up, too. She keeps getting weird flashes of things growing, changing, the occasional image that seems like maybe a room from an actual building somewhere. 

She turns the music up until it drowns them out. 

There isn't a whole lot on this side of town. The radio station and motel, down the hill she can see one of those bizarre Earth farms they somehow managed to set up. 

‚ÄúBoo!‚Äù

Diesel spins around and almost clocks her cousin Randall in the face. 

‚ÄúFucking hell, Randy! What are you doing out here!‚Äù Diesel gasps. 

‚ÄúCould ask you the same question.‚Äù Randall says. 

‚ÄúShut up, the band is over there.‚Äù She waves at the radio station. ‚ÄúWhy is your sorry ass up here?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy sorry ass works at that motel.‚Äù Randall says. 

‚ÄúAll grown up.‚Äù Diesel pats him on the head. ‚ÄúYou know any Marasats?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike, do I see them around, or am I, like, drinking buddies?‚Äù Randall asks. 

‚ÄúI mean, like, you ever talk to them? Like, just about whatever, not work or whatever.‚Äù Diesel says. 

Randall shrugs. ‚ÄúNot really. I mean, they just give, generic answers. ‚Äòwhats it like living down there‚Äô, ‚Äòdark‚Äô, that kind of shit.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can hear them, you know.‚Äù Diesel says. 

Randall becomes very quiet. He knew she could, of course, everybody knew, but it's not the sort of thing you bring up. 

‚ÄúWhat do they say?‚Äù He asks after a second. 

Diesel shakes her head. ‚ÄúI dunno. It‚Äôs, like, all of them, or at least the ones that are close enough. All at once.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds‚Ä¶confusing.‚Äù Randall says. ‚ÄúIs that why you wear the headphones?‚Äù

Diesel nods absently. ‚ÄúThat and‚Ä¶sometimes, it‚Äôs not voices. Sometimes it's just this sound like‚Ä¶feedback‚Ä¶you know, when it‚Äôs just like screaming and you‚Äôre like ‚Äòfuck me make it stop‚Äô.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù Randall says. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like something trying to burrow right into your brain. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶horrible. That's why everybody thought I was deaf or something when I was a little kid.‚Äù Diesel looks over the flora thoughtfully. ‚ÄúMy dad I guess realized what was going on, knew how to shut it up. Or at least drown it out.‚Äù

She drums her fingers on her arm, thinking. ‚ÄúSometimes, though, it‚Äôs like music in another room. If you actually quiet down and listen, you can hear the lyrics, but you can never remember them properly.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds‚Ä¶nice?‚Äù Randall says.

Diesel laughs. ‚ÄúIt is. Annoying, yes, but nice. It never quite sounds the way you want it to in your head, anyway. But then, sometimes‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt always work, even when it's the same song, but sometimes it‚Äôs like that‚Ä¶background‚Ä¶lines up with music. Or, a performance. Or something. It works in the projection theater but not when you use one of the really ‚Äòprofessional‚Äô shows, it‚Äôs like there's some sort of reaction between the band and the audience and the environment‚Ä¶and it can kind of be captured in a recording. And when that happens, you can sort of‚Ä¶see something‚Ä¶like, it‚Äôs living inside of whatever is going on, occupying the‚Ä¶empty spaces‚Ä¶somehow, and it's sort of coming through in waves, but if you kind of look out of the corner of your eye it‚Äôs like a‚Ä¶‚Äù Diesel struggles to find something Randall will understand. ‚ÄúOne of those chickens down on that farm. But it‚Äôs, like, on fire.‚Äù

‚ÄúMusic makes you see a flaming chicken?‚Äù Randall asks. 

‚ÄúI don't think it's supposed to be a chicken.‚Äù Diesel says. 

The music has ended and JJ is talking to the band again.

May takes off immediately when they get back, and Rahal gives her a blank look when Diesel asks about birds.

Diesel finds Benni laying down on the couch inside, watching some sort of nature show. 

‚ÄúYou know anything about Earth critters?‚Äù She asks.

‚ÄúA little. Why?‚Äù Benni asks. 

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt there some bird that, like, catches on fire? I mean, on purpose.‚Äù Diesel asks. 

Benni laughs. ‚ÄúPhoenix, firebird. It‚Äôs a symbol of regeneration, ‚Äòand from the ashes, I rise‚Äô. It‚Äôs not real.‚Äù

Diesel sighs. Benni tilts her head. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs bothering you, baby?‚Äù

‚ÄúFeedback.‚Äù Diesel says absently. 
‚Ä¶..

May has about five hours before it gets dark, and that term can be relative here. 

April is gone, May grabs the halter labeled ‚ÄúDevil Woman‚Äù. 

The black mare tries a few maneuvers, but quickly realizes May simply doesn't care and sets off at a comfortable trot. May lets her take off along Sunset, her hooves thumping on the ground, working herself nearly into a full gallop before losing steam and falling back into a trot again. 

May pulls her to a stop at the sign for Devil Falls Park. 

‚ÄúLooks like you‚Äôll be right at home.‚Äù May says, then gives her a nudge. 

Devil Woman starts to turn into the ‚Äòmultiuse trail‚Äô but May corrects her. The mare, sensing something unusual, becomes alert. 

They follow the road down, around a ‚Äòno civilians‚Äô sign, past a maintenance building behind a fence. 

May gives her a little kick and the mare steps off of the road. 

The ground falls away in a rough hill almost immediately. May gives the horse her head, and she navigates through the mix of Earth and native flora. 

They eventually hit a second access road, which May has the horse follow until they reach the end. 

There is a turn around here, a fence, about a thousand warning signs. 

This is one of the openings straight into the middle of the Marasat hive. 

May has no intent of trying to ride her sister's horse down there or something stupid like that. She just wanted to get a look at this place. 

She dismounts, the horse insists on walking with her down to the edge of the water. 

Up above them, Devil Falls plunges down a cliff and into an opening. They can hear the deep thrum of water from somewhere inside this cave. 

A shallow, sluggish stream of water runs along the ground, vanishing also into the darkness. 

The mare stomps in the water, splashing. Phosphorescent organisms flash angrily. May slaps the horse on the shoulder in irritation. 

A Marasat appears at the opening, then another. May climbs back on the mare, who is more than happy to bound back up the hill toward home.

‚Ä¶

Diesel eventually gets May alone. 

‚ÄúYou remember when I played that video at the Factory?‚Äù Diesel waits for confirmation. ‚ÄúThat thing you saw, the bird‚Ä¶it was on fire, wasn‚Äôt it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a ‚Äòbird'.‚Äù May says ‚ÄúIt's a phoenix.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you do know about them.‚Äù Diesel says. 

‚ÄúSort of, not really. It starts off as an egg, hatches into a worm, grows into a bird, then self-immolates and leaves an egg, and it starts again.‚Äù

‚ÄúMetal.‚Äù Diesel says. 

‚ÄúTotally.‚Äù May nods. 

‚ÄúBenni said they're not real.‚Äù Diesel says.

May makes a complicated gesture. ‚ÄúOn Earth, there are things that are on, like, a different frequency. You can‚Äôt touch them, but they can touch you. Sometimes you can only see them if you look the right way, in a mirror, or a keyhole, or a stone with a circle through it. They‚Äôre like that, real but not real.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever seen one?‚Äù Diesel asks. 

‚ÄúOh, no. Well‚Ä¶no.‚Äù May says.

‚ÄúWhat else do you know about them?‚Äù

‚ÄúNow, don‚Äôt quote me on any of this cause I could be way off, it's been a long time. But I think‚Ä¶‚Äù May leans back and blows out air thoughtfully. ‚ÄúThey can heal with their tears. Their feathers have some sort of magic powers. They can probably breathe fire or some shit. I think they sing, but maybe only right before they burn up. They might be able to change shape into other things.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶‚Äù Diesel prompts. 

‚ÄúHumans. I think sometimes they fall in love with somebody, and can do it, then.‚Äù May says. 

‚ÄúCross species relations are gross.‚Äù Diesel says absently. 

‚ÄúAll relations are gross.‚Äù May says.

In the beginning he was super sweet: flowers, dinner dates, little surprises. It honestly made me feel so special. But recently, it‚Äôs like all of that‚Äôs gone.

Now whenever we hang out it‚Äôs just him coming over to my place to watch Netflix or me going to his house while he games. No dinners, no going out, not even grabbing coffee together. I‚Äôve told him that I miss how it was at the start, and he just says we will do more stuff together but in due time, not right now as hes busy or doesnt have money etc (its never been about money, I just want to go for a walk with him or something)

I then brought this up on text AGAIN about how I have been feeling and we had an argument about it which is really unusual as we havent done a lot of arguing so far. I‚Äôve attached screenshots of the argument. I keep re reading it and it seems like he just flipped and true colours were shown, then he decides to just say it‚Äôs a joke and goes back to being sweet? Im really confused and dont know what to think about this - my sister said hes controlling POS but she never liked him and I feel some envy from her sometimes so I dont want to make a decision just off of her opinion either. He really hurt my feelings and showed me a side of him I‚Äôve not seen before. 

I get that relationships settle down, but I‚Äôm only 19 ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to feel like a married couple already?? I don‚Äôt need fancy things, I just want him to put in some effort and not make me feel like I‚Äôm begging for his attention.

I‚Äôve been in mental health treatment since May 2025 after having a breakdown at college that led to me needing to go into a residential mental health program. 5 months and a few new diagnoses later, here I am. In the middle of bumfuck suburban hell and trying to be as independent as possible and make things work on my own. 

I make an average of $1720 dollars per month after taxes working my current job, which is part-time (capped at 30 hours per week) and pays $16 an hour. My rent is going to be $1910 a month when I move into my new place- (which is absolutely really expensive, but actually works out cheaper given that I don‚Äôt drive and my current job and others are within walking distance.) Because I don‚Äôt make enough right now to pay for my expenses per month (approx $2296) I‚Äôm seeking another job, and my parents have agreed to give me a $1600 loan for the first two months so that I can get on my feet. The current plan is to hold two part time jobs and to work between a 45-60 hour work week. I am also thankfully on my parent‚Äôs health insurance, so that is not an expense that I have to pay each month. 

Basically, to the lovely folks here on this subreddit: I come to you with arms wide open and requesting any advice on saving money beyond my current budget that you have to offer. My parents are co-signing my apartment (which is the reason that I will be able to lease it) and so getting a roommate is out, because they don‚Äôt want a stranger on the lease. (They trust me to come up with the money each month for 9 months, but not a random person.) They also are refusing to let me apply for SNAP benefits because they want the tax credit for claiming me as a dependent üòí

Yeah, you read that right. Let me explain how we got here.

Three years ago, I convinced my husband we should open our marriage. He didn't want to. Said he was happy with just us. But I kept pushing. Told him it would spice things up. That we were getting boring. Eventually he gave in.

The truth? My high school ex had moved back to town. We'd been flirting on Facebook for months. I wanted him but didn't want to lose my comfortable life. So I manipulated my husband into agreeing to something he never wanted.

The rules were simple. Always be honest. Use protection. No one we both knew. I broke all three immediately.

My ex and I started meeting twice a week. Hotels, his apartment, even our house when my husband was at work. Meanwhile, my husband went on maybe two dates in six months. Both times he came home looking miserable.

""This isn't for me,"" he said after the second date. ""I just want my wife.""

""You're not trying hard enough,"" I told him. ""Download more apps. Put yourself out there.""

So he did. And that's when everything changed.

He matched with this woman. A doctor. Beautiful. Smart. Everything I wasn't. They went for coffee. Then dinner. Then she was all he talked about.

""She makes me laugh,"" he said one night. ""Like really laugh. I forgot what that felt like.""

That stung. But I kept seeing my ex. Even increased it to four times a week. Started getting sloppy. Left receipts around. Came home with hickeys. Part of me wanted him to catch me. To fight for me.

Instead, he started pulling away. Working late. Going to the gym. Spending weekends with his family. When I confronted him, he just shrugged.

""Isn't this what you wanted?"" he asked. ""For us to explore?""

Our daughter noticed. She was 16, not stupid. Started asking why daddy was never home. Why mommy smelled like cologne. Why we never ate dinner together anymore.

Then came Thanksgiving.

His whole family was there. Parents, siblings, cousins. Everyone asking about our marriage. I was on edge. My husband seemed fine. Happy even.

His sister pulled out her phone during dessert. ""Oh my god, look what I found on Facebook!""

It was a post from my ex's girlfriend. Screenshots of our conversations. Photos of us together. Everything.

The room went silent. My husband didn't even look surprised.

""We know,"" his mother said. ""We've known for months.""

Turns out my husband had told them everything. How I forced the open marriage. How I broke every rule. How I was planning to leave him for my ex once I figured out the finances.

""But here's the thing,"" his father said. ""We've been helping him prepare.""

My husband had been moving money. Documenting my affair. Meeting with lawyers. That woman he was seeing? She wasn't just beautiful and smart. She was also helping him strategize.

""I gave you what you wanted,"" my husband said quietly. ""An open marriage. But you didn't want open. You wanted to cheat without consequences.""

They had printed emails where I admitted to manipulating him. Texts where I laughed about him with my ex. Even a recording of me telling my friend I was using him for his money.

His sister looked at our daughter. ""Your mom's been lying to all of us. But we wanted you to know the truth.""

My daughter just stared at me. Then she got up and hugged her dad.

The divorce was brutal. I got minimum alimony. Split custody became every other weekend after my daughter told the judge she wanted to live with her dad. My ex dumped me the minute the money dried up. Said he never planned to leave his girlfriend anyway.

My husband's dating that doctor now. They look happy. Really happy. My daughter loves her. Calls her bonus mom. Posts pictures of their ski trips and cooking sessions.

I'm in a studio apartment. Working two jobs. Watching their life on social media because none of them will speak to me directly.

Last week I sent my husband a long apology. Begged for another chance. Said I realized what I lost.

He responded with one line: ""You didn't lose anything. You threw it away.""

So reddit, AITA for being angry that my husband moved on when I'm the one who wanted an open marriage in the first place?

They collected specimens. Dangerous anomalies. Evolutionary dead-ends that threatened galactic stability. When you've spent three millennia building the perfect hierarchical civilization, you can't afford to acknowledge that some ""primitives"" might actually be people. That would imply the hierarchy was wrong.

And if the hierarchy was wrong about specimen classification, what else might it be wrong about?

So when Vex-9, the galaxy's premier specimen acquisition specialist, was found dead in his maximum-security menagerie with his neck snapped clean, the Council faced their worst nightmare. The official investigation concluded immediately: one of the specimens had evolved beyond containment and eliminated their captor.

Case closed. File sealed. Crisis contained.

Except the Galactic Criminal Investigation Bureau required an independent review for all Class-Alpha facilities. Protocol. Bureaucracy. The kind of red tape that builds civilizations and occasionally destroys them.

And into this carefully constructed denial shuffled Detective Arthur Dibble.

Human. Coffee-stained coat that had seen better decades. Notebook held together with actual tape because ""digital files can be hacked, but you'd have to mug me to steal these notes."" The Council called him ""the carbon-based anomaly with delusions of investigation."" The specimen containment AI just called him ""Detective Inefficiency.""

But Dibble had solved the Crystalline Collective Murder (the victim was their own logic system), and the Quantum Casino Heist (the thieves had stolen the probability of winning). As the Council prepared their sanitized briefing, Dibble squinted at the crime scene photos and muttered:

""Funny thing about maximum security. The tighter the cage, the more you wonder what happens when someone finds the key.""

Hegemony Station orbited a dead moon in empty space, as far from civilization as you could get while still maintaining quantum communication. The perfect place to house the galaxy's ""most dangerous evolutionary mistakes.""

Councilor Thex-Prime materialized in the briefing room, her crystalline form refracting anxiety into prismatic warnings. ""Detective Dibble, we appreciate the Bureau's... thoroughness... but this matter is quite straightforward. One of our contained specimens clearly breached protocol and eliminated Vex-9. We simply need you to determine which one and file the appropriate closure documentation.""

""Uh-huh."" Dibble flipped through his notebook. ""Got a list of these specimens?""

""Certainly. Cell Block A contains four subjects of maximum classification."" Thex-Prime's form solidified into bureaucratic efficiency. ""Designation Zara: telepathic parasite capable of mental infiltration. Designation Grove: hostile ecosystem with distributed consciousness. Designation Quantum: reality hazard with dimensional perception anomalies. Designation Echo: perfect mimic with adaptive camouflage capabilities.""

Dibble looked up from his notes. ""Got any actual names for these folks?""

Thex-Prime flickered. ""Detective, these are classified specimens, not... persons. Emotional attachment to contained subjects is strictly...""

""Ma'am,"" Dibble said gently, ""I've been doing this for thirty years. When somebody won't use names, it usually means they don't want to think of them as people. That's fine for your job. But it makes mine harder.""

""Your job is to identify which specimen committed the crime.""

""My job,"" Dibble said, standing up and checking his watch, ""is to figure out what actually happened. Sometimes those are the same thing. Sometimes they're not.""

The crime scene was exactly what Dibble expected from a man like Vex-9: cold, sterile, designed to remind visitors who was in charge. Banks of monitors showed feeds from dozens of containment cells. The body lay in the center of the observation chamber, positioned with surgical precision.

Vex-9 had been tall for his species, nearly seven feet, with the kind of biomechanical enhancements that marked him as Hegemony elite. The neck injury was clean‚Äîone twist, perfectly executed. No defensive wounds. No signs of struggle.

""Security footage?"" Dibble asked.

""Corrupted,"" the station AI responded with mechanical satisfaction. ""Localized electromagnetic interference occurred at 0012 hours. All visual records from 2300 to 0100 hours are irretrievable.""

""Convenient. What about the containment logs?""

""All cells remained sealed throughout the incident. No breaches detected. No alerts triggered. All systems functioned within normal parameters.""

Dibble made a note and headed for the cells.

The first containment unit was a masterpiece of psychological warfare disguised as scientific observation. Neural dampers hummed in the walls. Environmental controls maintained perfect sterility. In the center, on a simple cot that looked more like a medical table, sat a young woman who couldn't have been more than twenty-five.

She looked up when Dibble approached, and he saw eyes that had seen too much for someone so young.

""You're new,"" she said. Her voice carried an accent he couldn't place. ""Usually they just send the automated interrogators.""

""Arthur Dibble. I'm investigating what happened to Vex-9."" He settled into the visitor's chair, noting how it was positioned to make the occupant feel small. ""Mind if I ask your name?""

She blinked, clearly surprised. ""My... name?""

""Well, I could call you 'telepathic parasite,' but that seems rude.""

A small smile flickered across her face‚Äîthe first genuine expression Dibble had seen since arriving at the station. ""Zara. My name is Zara.""

""Nice to meet you, Zara. Hell of a place you've got here.""

She laughed, and it was a broken sound. ""Five years I've been in this cell. Five years since they classified me as a 'telepathic parasite' and decided I was too dangerous for civilization.""

""What's your actual ability?""

""I'm an empath. I feel what others feel‚Äîtheir pain, their joy, their fear. During the Keth War, I worked in military hospitals. I could ease soldiers' suffering, help them process trauma."" Her voice went quiet. ""I was good at it.""

""What changed?""

""They wanted to weaponize it. Turn empathy into a tool for interrogation and control. When I refused..."" She gestured at the cell around them.

Dibble felt that familiar itch at the back of his mind‚Äîthe one that meant something didn't add up. ""Vex-9 ever talk to you about that?""

Zara's expression shifted. ""Recently, yes. The last few weeks, actually. He'd been... different. Quieter. He stopped calling me 'specimen' and started using my name. Asked about my family, my home world.""

""When's the last time you saw him?""

""Three nights ago. He came by during his usual rounds, but he seemed... weighted down. Sad. He asked me if I thought people could change, really change.""

""What did you tell him?""

""That anyone could, if they wanted to badly enough.""

The second cell housed what the files called a ""hostile ecosystem,"" but as Dibble approached, he realized he wasn't looking at an ecosystem at all. He was looking at refugees.

The Grove filled most of the containment space: beings that might once have been individual humanoids but had grown together, their bodies intertwined with flowing organic matter that pulsed with bioluminescent patterns. They moved as one, breathed as one, sang as one.

When Dibble sat down, they turned to regard him with dozens of eyes set in dozens of faces, all connected by the same flowing network.

""We know you,"" they said, their voices harmonizing into something like music. ""The questioner who sees individuals in the collective.""

""Just a detective. I'm trying to figure out what happened to Vex-9.""

""The Keeper is gone,"" the Grove said, their song shifting to something melancholy. ""We felt his ending. Sharp. Quick. Final.""

""Your world was strip-mined, wasn't it?"" Dibble said quietly. ""The files say you're a 'hostile ecosystem,' but you're survivors. Your people fused together to survive ecological collapse.""

The Grove's harmony became something like weeping. ""Our song carries the memories of our world. Every tree that was cut, every stream that was poisoned, every child that was lost when the machines came.""

""I'm sorry.""

""Three cycles ago, the Keeper came to listen to our song. He had been listening more, in recent times. Learning. That night, he asked us to sing the song of change‚Äîhow the forest grows back after fire.""

""What did you tell him?""

""That change requires deep roots. That new growth comes from old pain. That sometimes the strongest trees grow in the worst soil.""

The third cell looked like a playground designed by someone who'd never seen a happy child. Soft surfaces, bright colors, educational toys‚Äîall mounted behind force fields that could probably contain a small star.

In the center sat what appeared to be a ten-year-old human child, playing with blocks that phased in and out of visible reality.

""Hello!"" the child said brightly when Dibble arrived. ""Are you here to play? Nobody ever wants to play anymore.""

""I'm Arthur. What's your name?""

""Quantum! Well, that's what they call me. My real name is harder to say in this many dimensions.""

Dibble rubbed his temples. Ten years old. They'd caged a ten-year-old child. ""Quantum, I'm trying to figure out what happened to Vex-9. Did you see anything unusual a few nights ago?""

Quantum giggled and held up a block that was somehow both purple and transparent. ""I see lots of things! The tall one came at night-time, but also at not-night-time. He walked funny that night.""

""Funny how?""

""Like he was carrying heavy things, but not in his hands. In his maybe-space. Sorry-things. Sad-things. Choice-things."" The child's expression became serious. ""He was going to do something big. I could see it in his light-colors.""

""Did anyone else come that night?""

""Oh yes! The shadow-people came after. They move in the narrow-spaces between seconds. They took the sorry-things away, but they couldn't take them from the maybe-times.""

The fourth cell was a perfect white cube, empty except for a single figure sitting in its exact center. As Dibble approached, the figure stood and changed.

In seconds, Dibble was looking at himself‚Äînot just his appearance, but his posture, his expression, even the way he held his notepad. It was flawless mimicry that went beyond mere shapeshifting.

""Impressive,"" Dibble said.

""Thank you,"" the duplicate said in Dibble's exact voice. ""I am designated Echo. I assume you're here about the Keeper's termination.""

""Mind switching back? Talking to myself is unsettling.""

Echo shifted, becoming... generic. Humanoid, but without distinctive features, like a person-shaped question mark. ""This is as close to my original form as I can manage. Years of forced transformations have... eroded... my sense of self.""

""Forced transformations?""

""The Keeper would bring visitors. I would be required to become whatever they found most threatening, most alien, most worthy of containment. A perfect monster, on demand.""

Dibble felt a cold anger building in his chest. ""Did you see him the night he died?""

Echo was quiet for a long moment. ""I see everything, Detective Dibble. I have to, in order to mirror it perfectly. The Keeper came that night, and he carried himself differently. Like someone carrying old guilt.""

""Carrying what else?""

""Data files. Real files, not the sanitized reports. Personnel records, acquisition orders. And he was terrified.""

""Of what?""

""Of the people who would come for him when they discovered what he was planning to do.""

That night, Dibble did what he always did: he ignored the official evidence and started looking for the real story.

Vex-9's personal quarters told a different tale than the official files. Where the public areas were sterile and imposing, his private rooms were almost humble. And on every surface were journals. Physical journals, handwritten, as if their author couldn't trust digital files.

Dibble opened one at random:

*Day 2,847. Acquired new specimen from the Keth border conflicts. Designation: Zara. Classification: telepathic parasite. Initial assessment suggests empathic abilities rather than parasitic behavior. Subject appears distressed by containment. Note: consider reviewing classification standards.*

Another entry, weeks later:

*Zara demonstrates consistent empathic rather than parasitic behavior. She expressed concern for my wellbeing during questioning, despite her circumstances. Recommend expanded psychological evaluation.*

The language changed over months. ""Specimens"" became ""subjects"" became ""individuals."" ""Containment protocols"" became ""imprisonment."" ""Acquisition"" became ""kidnapping.""

The final journal was different. Recent entries were written in a shaky hand:

*I have been complicit in atrocities. Grove survivors of genocide, contained because their grief*¬†

*threatened our expansion narrative. Quantum, a child whose only crime is seeing reality clearly. Echo, tortured into forgetting herself. Zara, punished for refusing to weaponize compassion.*

*They are not specimens. They are people. And I have helped cage them.*

*I must make this right.*

The last entry was dated three days before Vex-9's death:

*The escape protocols are ready. Security overrides, transport arrangements, safe houses‚Äîeverything they need for freedom. But I know the Council will come for me. I hope I can complete the transfer before‚Äî*

The entry ended mid-sentence.

The next morning, Dibble called a meeting with the Council representatives.

""Mr. Dibble,"" Thex-Prime began as she materialized, ""we trust you have reached the obvious conclusion‚Äî""

""Oh, I've reached a conclusion,"" Dibble said, settling into his chair. ""Just not the one you wanted.""

He laid it out piece by piece. The journals documenting Vex-9's moral awakening. The escape protocols he'd been preparing. The real reason for his death.

""Vex-9 wasn't killed by one of his prisoners,"" Dibble said, scratching his head and looking almost apologetic. ""He was killed by his employers. By you. Because he remembered what you've worked so hard to forget.""

""This is preposterous‚Äî""

""That these aren't specimens,"" Dibble continued. ""They're people. A young woman guilty of refusing to torture patients. Survivors of genocide. A child who sees across dimensions. A person so broken by forced transformations she doesn't remember who she used to be.""

He pulled out his battered notebook. ""See, here's what I think happened. Vex-9 figured out that the specimen program wasn't science‚Äîit was warehousing inconvenient people. So he decided to do something about it. And you killed him for it.""

""Even if such accusations had merit,"" Thex-Prime said carefully, ""who would believe the word of contained specimens over the Galactic Council?""

""Well,"" Dibble said, ""that's the thing about modern technology."" He pressed a button on his notebook. Throughout the station, speakers crackled to life. ""This conversation's been broadcasting to every major news network in the galaxy for the last five minutes.""

The silence that followed was profound.

""You see,"" Dibble continued conversationally, ""humans have this saying: give them enough rope, and they'll hang themselves. You just confirmed everything I accused you of. On the record.""

The containment fields died one by one. Not broken‚Äîunlocked. Vex-9's final gift, triggered by the very confrontation that had killed him.

Zara stepped out of her cell for the first time in five years. The Grove flowed out in a tide of organic matter that somehow looked joyful. Quantum skipped through the walls, phasing in and out of reality. Echo stood in her doorway, no longer generic, but gloriously, indefinably herself.

""The real mystery wasn't how Vex-9 died,"" Dibble said as the freed prisoners gathered around him. ""It was how an entire civilization convinced itself that people weren't people if you called them something else.""

The aftermath was swift. Trials began within weeks. The specimen program was dismantled. Reparations followed.

The four former prisoners chose to stay together, forming a small community on a neutral world. Zara established a counseling center. The Grove began growing a new forest. Quantum started a school for gifted children. Echo was still figuring out who she wanted to be.

They invited Dibble to visit. He went twice, just long enough to see they were healing.

When the Galactic Council offered him a fortune as a ""reward for exposing corruption,"" he turned it down.

""Keep your credits,"" he told them. ""Buy yourselves a conscience instead. Might do you more good.""

Instead, he went back to his small office with its flickering lights and terrible coffee. The galaxy had plenty of impossible crimes. But more importantly, it had plenty of people who needed someone to see them as people.

Arthur Dibble was good at that kind of work.

His final case report was typically brief:

*Subject: Death of Vex-9*

*Conclusion: Homicide by Council agents to prevent prisoner release*

*Recommendation: Complete dismantlement of specimen program*

*Note: Next time someone calls prisoners 'specimens,' maybe ask why*¬†

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

Ali√°s, talvez seja mais correto dizer: talvez eu seja um dos maiores haters do Pato Rei (em breve fa√ßo um post aqui dizendo os motivos).

Mas esse gr√£o aqui merece todo o reconhecimento e gl√≥rias! Parab√©ns ü¶Üüëë

**No nariz**, quando quente tem um doce profundo de compota de laranja, a√ß√∫car mascavo e frutas secas; quando vai esfriando, destaca mais o frutado da ameixa e do figo seco, com leves notas c√≠tricas em segundo plano. N√£o senti o floral de capim lim√£o citado no pacote, mas facilmente afirmo que esse √© um caf√© com arom√°tico muito profundo e de m√©dia complexidade.

**Na boca**, ele tem corpo m√©dio e bastante dul√ßor, algo esperado pelo processo natural. A a acidez √© relativamente baixa, mas √© presente. Das notas arom√°ticas, o que mais destaca na boca √© a ameixa em calda e a mexirica. Uma del√≠cia! 

**Receita**: moagem 4.5 no ZP6; minha receita de √°gua padr√£o Lotus para coados (gotas para 600mL: 3Mg, 1Ca, 3K); √°gua a 94c; todos os despejos com Melodrip em m√©dia altura (para gerar alguma agita√ß√£o); concentra√ß√£o de 1:17 (e j√° ficou bem intenso, imagina 1:15?); 3 despejos iguais de 60g (sem bloom pq t√° bem descansado); extracao total de 2m30s.

Uma curiosidade: achei muito parecido com o Bioma 90 Pontos, da Prima/No Name. Ambos muito doces, arom√°ticos, frutados e de m√©dia complexidade. A diferen√ßa principal √© na acidez, profundidade e na complexidade, que no Figo √© maior em todos esses quesitos. Apesar da nota do Bioma ser um pouco maior que o Figo, n√£o tenho d√∫vidas de que o Figo √© um caf√© mais interessante (talvez seja bias devido ao pre√ßo que paguei no Figo? Sim üòÇ)

**Informa√ß√µes gerais**: 
- Catua√≠ da regi√£o de Mantiqueira de Minas (Fazenda Serra das Tr√™s Barras). **6o lugar no Cup of Excellence Brasil 2024, com nota 88.78** (veja o print nas imagens do post). *Ps.: *J√° tomei caf√©s que supostamente tinham nota acima de 90, que eram muito menos interessantes que esse‚Ä¶ me faz questionar bastante as notas que vemos por a√≠).*
- Trata-se de uma edi√ß√£o limitada (150 unidades de apenas 100g). Congelado pela pr√≥pria torrefa√ß√£o, chegou num pacote de isopor e √† vacuo.
- Um dos caf√©s mais caros que j√° comprei (custou R$160,00). N√£o √© o tipo de extravag√¢ncia que costumo fazer por t√£o pouco caf√©, mas me permiti por ser uma data especial. Valeu a pena? Acho que sim. Puta cafez√£o.
- Esse lote foi arrematado pela **Proud Mary** (uma das maiores torrefa√ß√µes dos EUA - n√£o sei dizer como o Pato Rei conseguiu esses 15kg, mas o pacote afirma que eles arremataram ‚Äújunto‚Äù com os americanos. Nas fotos do post, coloquei o print de uma publica√ß√£o do Pato Rei no Insta falando de um encontro e bar takeover que o Pato fez na Proud Mary l√° em Austin esse ano.
- Tive a oportunidade de experimentar 2 caf√©s torrados pela Proud Marry esse ano, via gr√£os convidados da cafeteria King Experience (em Goi√¢nia). O n√≠vel deles √© muito alto! O que diz muito sobre o quanto esse caf√© √© especial.

Ps.: tive que improvisar adicionando uma foto do pacote na foto da x√≠cara, por que usei a caixinha para presentear um amigo com um kit de 15g de cada um dos 5 melhores gr√£os que eu tinha (e claro, o Figo foi um deles). Foi a retribui√ß√£o por um presente que ganhei dele, um pacote inteirinho de um et√≠ope
Torrado em Paris pela Tanat (pacote que infelizmente estou quase terminando e em breve posto o review por aqui).

He picked me up in his car. Smiled like he already knew me. That was it.
From that day on, we never stopped talking. It just became what it was.

The first years were intense. I idealized him, but there was something real too.
He was brilliant. Fast. Emotionally sharp.
His career exploded. He went from nothing to everything in no time.
In 2020 we moved in together.
Every evening we cooked for each other. No TV.
Always something to say.
Arguments, jokes, silence, closeness. It felt full.

In 2022 we started using drugs.
At first it was about sex, energy, parties.
Then it shifted.
The connection thinned. The chaos grew.
We drifted. Slowly, but clearly.

In May 2023 I left. He was 32. I couldn‚Äôt stay.
We hadn‚Äôt been together for almost two years when he died.

We still talked sometimes.
Not much. Not deeply. But enough.
I didn‚Äôt tell people about it.
Everyone around me said to stay away.
I didn‚Äôt fully listen.

After the breakup, he became vindictive.
He hurt me in ways that took time to understand.
It was confusing.
But I started a new relationship not long after.
And through that, I saw it more clearly.
How toxic things had become.
How much I had bent myself.

We had one last dinner in February 2025.
He looked thinner. Unstable. Still clever. Still himself in flashes.
But something had gone quiet inside him.

Our last message exchange was in late June.
Short, almost nothing.
But looking back, it read like a goodbye.

In August 2025, he ended his life. He was 34.
No message. No sound. Just silence.

His neighbor called me.
I was the closest person around.
I went.
I stood there as four men carried him out in a black bag.
His mother arrived later.
Same garden where we used to talk about the future.
Where we had coffee. Where we laughed.

He came into my life with a smile, standing by a car.
He left zipped up, carried through the back gate.

At the end he wasn‚Äôt tragic. He wasn‚Äôt romantic.
He was broken.
Detached from the people around him. From himself.
No direction. No fight left.
Just noise inside and nothing holding him here.

Sometimes people just let go.

I still love him.
Yes.
He hurt me.
Yes.
I‚Äôm a better person without him.
Also yes.
I grew.
Yes.
Is it still a mess in my head?
Yes.
But I‚Äôm healing.

You just can't get immersed when you know that some of those dudes pulling off encirclements were stinky N*zis OTL, that are probably executing the encircled troops?

There must be a way to solve this inherent contradiction! Well, now you can! Introducing: The German general tier list!

We will rank the German generals according to the patented *I googled this shit for a few hours*‚Ñ¢ technology! 

Let us begin by saying this, however: as far as I'm concerned, almost all of these men are either war criminals or butchers of humans, both the ones under their command and the ones they are killing. They are not good people, war is bad(so brave!) and military achievements belong in these games and the dustbin of history, the people that start wars are all demons and should be boiled.

Alright, now onto the tier list! We're going from ""Just following orders"" to ""War criminals"" and onto the ""Should be summarily shot"". Notice how none of the tiers are ""good""? Exactly.

#TL;DR:

""Just following orders"": Curt Haase, Erwin von Witzleben, Eugen Ritter von Schobert * , Friedrich Paulus, Gotthard Heinrici, Rupprecht von Bayern * , Alfred von Vollard-Bockelberg * , Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord * , Werner von Blomberg * , Werner von Fritsch #, Ludwig Beck #, Walther Wever #, Manfred von Richthofen #, Ernst Volckheim, Erich von Bonin * , Franz von Bayern*, Georg Wetzell #, Hugo Sperrle #.

War criminals: Albert Kesselring, Eberhard von Mackensen, Erich Hoepner * *, Ewald von Kleist * *, Fedor von Bock, Georg von K√ºchler, G√ºnther von Kluge, Maximilian von Weichs, Nikolaus von Falkenhorst, Walter Model, Wilhelm List, Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb, Gerd von Rundstedt, Walther von Brauchitsch #, Kurt Student, Hermann Balck.

Should be summarily shot: Franz Halder * * *, Hermann Hoth, Walter von Reichenau, Heinz Guderian * * *, Erich von Manstein * * * , Robert Ritter von Greim #.

The reason I split off ""Should be summarily shot"" and ""War criminals"" isn't that the war criminals are any better, but that those under them don't even deserve a trial with how fucking evil they were, it would be a waste of oxygen to allow them to lie in court.

 # : These are staff officers in game. Beck was a shithead but he was sidelined prior to the war. The Red Baron obviously died in The Great War, but he was apolitical up to his death, Wever died in 1936, von Fritsch was killed in Poland just 21 days into the war. Wetzell was too old for the war. Sperrle was twice acquitted for war crimes.

\* : von Schobert died 3 months into Barbarossa, but I couldn't find evidence of him participating in war crimes up to that point. Rupprecht von Bayern was obviously too old for the war, but the family was against the N\*zis and his wife and children were imprisoned and moved around concentration camps. Von Vollard-Bockelberg was on the older side and was discharged in 1940. Von Hammerstein-Equord was one of the few officers that did everything in his power to stop H\*tler, even fraternized with trade unionists, but was a close friend to Schleicher which prevents him from being the one ""good"" guy. Blomberg is very lucky he was sidelined in 1938, as he was an ardent supporter of the n\*zis. Franz von Bayern was too old to serve. Von Bonin was a staff officer and too old to serve.

\* * : If you want to rehabilitate these men in your head cannon there is a bit of wiggle room for that. I wouldn't though. Hoepner was part of the July 20th Plot and resisted the mistreatment of POWs in Poland. He only committed war crimes in the Soviet Union in pursuit of the war of extermination, it is possible that a sane regime would prevent him from this. Von Kleist was pretty pragmatic, he's the reason Germany recruited so many collaborators and he protected some Mizrahi Jews.

\* * * : Franz Halder, Erich von Manstein and Heinz ""I invented everything"" Guderian are the primary architects of the ""Clean Wehrmacht"" myth(I'd call it disinformation campaign). These men were criminals and their self-serving lies poisoned our historiography for decades. Halder not only issued the war of extermination decree, he was also incredibly incompetent, his actions directly sabotaged Germany's war effort by shifting focus away from the oil fields of Maikop, Grozny and Baku, redirecting reinforcements and materiel towards the Moscow axis. That's the only good thing that can be said about him: his incompetence hastened the defeat of Germany.

- The research surveyed 92 participants who rated privacy concerns for images containing items such as passports, driver‚Äôs licenses, smartphones, coffee cups and books.
- Items directly linked to personal identity (e.g., passports, facial images) were consistently judged as highly sensitive, while generic objects like coffee cups were seen as low risk.
- Context mattered: a smartphone captured inside a private home raised higher privacy concerns than the same device photographed in a public caf√©.
- When a high‚Äërisk object appeared alongside neutral items, overall privacy perception often dropped, suggesting a dilution effect; multiple sensitive objects together amplified concern.
- The authors propose object‚Äëlevel detection and context‚Äëaware algorithms to flag or warn users about privacy‚Äësensitive content before sharing.

Why it matters: Understanding which visual cues trigger privacy worries can help developers create tools that protect personal information without limiting visual expression.

First time posting so I‚Äôm sorry if this is messy at all. This is kinda long and I apologize about that.

I (25F) and my BF(25M) have been dating for about 2 years now. And I‚Äôm in need of some advice. But for some context‚Ä¶ We met at work, and we were both instantly attracted to each other. Nothing happened at first cause we both just got out of long term relationships and just wanted to see how things went. Which lasted a while. (6-7 months)

While we weren‚Äôt in a relationship, we both said we‚Äôd be exclusive for talking and in bed. My problem is with his friend girl. She never has liked me and I never knew why. While my partner-not-partner was away on his first business trip for about 2 months, his friends ( 2 male, 2 female) decided to get together and hang out. One of his guy friends invited me cause he knew we were friends/talking. We went out for axe throwing and the friend girl ignored me the whole time,(which I thought it was because in more reserved then the people there who knew each other for a while) afterwards we all went out to eat. At the dinner, friend girl decided to loudly say and stare directly at me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like people when I first meet them‚Äù. Which I tried not to take to heart, but it did hurt since I was new to the job and also wanted to try and make friends especially with the guy I‚Äôm interested in having a relationship withs friends.

Later on when my partner-not-partner got back from his trip, friend girl decided to host a party for him at her house. I wasn‚Äôt invited, but one of the guys brought me to it as a guest. Which I made him check with her that it was okay for me to go. She agreed. At the party we played that card game where you think a person is more likely to be the card. (Such as, ‚Äúwho is more likely to have a hidden tattoo, who was more likely to be a stay at home parent‚Äù etc). Any time there was a bad card she would direct it towards me. Which hurt that she thought bad about me, on top of making my partner-not-partner see me in a bad light. Again I tried to think of it as, I‚Äôm new and not to take it to heart. But my feelings was hurt by this game. After a while of being the butt end of the stick, I said I had a headache a left. I said my goodbyes and respects. And talked to his guy friend later about what she said. Apparently it‚Äôs normal for her not to like people at all and then flip the script and like them. I just had to wait it out.

After my partner and I got together, we decided to keep our relationship private so it didn‚Äôt affect our work life. After we made our relationship, I asked him if friend girl didn‚Äôt like me. And every excuse was used. ‚ÄúShe just isn‚Äôt a people person‚Äù or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the way it is‚Äù or ‚Äúmaybe if you guys weren‚Äôt so worried about the other not liking the other, you could be good friends‚Äù.
She would ignore me in the halls when I tried to stop and say hi. Or when I was getting peoples orders for a coffee run, she acted like I was her assistant getting her coffee. I told my boyfriend, since I knew my problem is jealousy and just insecurity on my part. But he stopped hanging out with her as much(of his own will/reasons, I didn‚Äôt force him to drop a friend). She didn‚Äôt like this. 

A while had past, and I thought her and I could move past things and maybe be friends or we could all be friends. So when I saw her page on instagram, I decided to follow her. She added me back right away as well. That night my boyfriend just kept looking at his phone and got quiet (he usually does this when he‚Äôs texting with his guy friends so I thought nothing of it). Apparently she found out we were dating through a post on my insta.( 2/6 were photos with him in it and we were not alone as they were group photos). She was upset, and texting him all night. In the morning he asked me if I was willing to go through my social medias and just readdress who we added. (He would do the same). To lower the drama that we bring into our lives. I‚Äôm not sure what was said between them, and my insecurities make me want to ask. Since I feel like there is more to the story with her that he doesn‚Äôt want to tell me. I don‚Äôt know if this would be crossing a line since we kinda have  don‚Äôt ask, don‚Äôt tell things going on when it comes to past partners. I trust him full heartedly, he‚Äôs giving me no reason not to trust him. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs my story. Please let me know if there‚Äôs any advice or ideas on what I could do. I know this is just my insecurities talking, and I kinda just don‚Äôt know how to turn off my brain about it.

1nkaezu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyItemsReview/comments/1nkaezu/oil_water_or_silicone_how_to_actually_figure_out/,"Oil, Water, or Silicone? How to Actually Figure Out Your Foundation & Primer Base","We‚Äôve all been there: standing in front of the mirror wondering why your primer is peeling up under your foundation or why your makeup looks flawless for two hours and then melts off by lunch. Nine times out of ten, the problem isn‚Äôt your application, it‚Äôs that your products don‚Äôt _like each other._

The secret sauce? Understanding whether your foundation or primer is **oil-based, water-based, or silicone-based.** Once you know that, layering products gets way easier, and your makeup lasts way longer. Let‚Äôs break this down in real-world, non-science-lab terms.

- - -

## Why the Base Actually Matters

Think of your makeup like building blocks: if the foundations (literally) don‚Äôt match, the whole thing crumbles. The base affects:

*   **Skin Compatibility:** Does it play nice with your skin type (oily, dry, combo)?
    
*   **Finish Goals:** Dewy goddess? Matte queen? Somewhere in between?
    
*   **Wear Time:** Does it last through a sweaty commute or vanish by coffee break?
    
*   **Product Compatibility:** Will your primer and foundation bond or start a mini war on your face?
    

And yes, it can even make or break whether your skin feels comfy or clogged.

- - -

## Step 1: Decode the Buzzwords

Brands love throwing around fancy words. Here‚Äôs how to spot what‚Äôs hiding in the bottle:

### Silicone-Based

Look for:

*   ‚ÄúVelvety,‚Äù ‚Äúsilky,‚Äù ‚Äúphoto finish,‚Äù ‚Äúblurring,‚Äù or ‚Äúlong-wearing‚Äù
    
*   Usually promises that airbrushed, Instagram-filter look
    
*   Great at filling in pores and lines
    

_Examples:_ Smashbox Photo Finish Primer, Est√©e Lauder Double Wear Foundation

### Oil-Based

Look for:

*   ‚ÄúHydrating,‚Äù ‚Äúnourishing,‚Äù ‚Äúglow-enhancing,‚Äù ‚Äúmoisturizing‚Äù
    
*   Usually marketed toward dry or mature skin
    
*   Feels richer, gives that dewy finish
    

_Examples:_ Josie Maran Vibrancy Foundation, NYX Hydra Touch Oil Primer

### Water-Based

Look for:

*   ‚ÄúOil-free,‚Äù ‚Äúlightweight,‚Äù ‚Äúweightless,‚Äù ‚Äúhydrating‚Äù
    
*   Often recommended for oily, sensitive, or acne-prone skin
    
*   Feels fresh and breathable
    

_Examples:_ Too Faced Hangover Rx Primer, bareMinerals Original Foundation

_Pro tip:_ If you‚Äôre lost, hop on Sephora/Ulta and skim the ingredients section‚Äîthey usually give it away.

- - -

## Step 2: Ingredient Sleuthing

If you really want to know, flip to the ingredients list. The first 3‚Äì5 items tell you the story.

*   **Silicone-based:** Look for anything ending in `-cone`, `-siloxane`, or `-methicone`. (Dimethicone and Cyclopentasiloxane are the usual suspects.)
    
*   **Oil-based:** You‚Äôll see oils right at the top‚Äîargan oil, jojoba, avocado, mineral oil, etc.
    
*   **Water-based:** ‚ÄúWater‚Äù (aqua) will be first, and oils/silicones won‚Äôt dominate the list. Instead, you‚Äôll see humectants like glycerin or hyaluronic acid.
    

- - -

## Step 3: The Quick Hand Test

When in doubt, just swatch it.

*   **Silicone:** Slippery, velvety, fills in texture.
    
*   **Oil:** Rich, emollient, shiny/dewy.
    
*   **Water:** Lightweight, soaks in quickly, sometimes a bit tacky.
    

I‚Äôve done this in Sephora aisles more times than I care to admit (yes, I‚Äôm that person standing there patting the back of my hand like a weirdo).

- - -

## So‚Ä¶ Which Base Is ‚ÄúBest‚Äù?

Here‚Äôs the honest truth: there‚Äôs no ‚Äúone-size-fits-all.‚Äù It depends on your skin and what you want your makeup to do.

### Silicone-Based

*   **Best for:** Oily or combo skin, anyone who wants pore-blurring + long wear
    
*   **Pros:** Smooths texture, lasts all day, great for events/photos
    
*   **Cons:** Can feel heavy, may clog pores if you don‚Äôt cleanse well, doesn‚Äôt play well with water-based layers
    

### Oil-Based

*   **Best for:** Dry, flaky, or mature skin craving hydration + glow
    
*   **Pros:** Feels nourishing, dewy finish, skin-friendly oils
    
*   **Cons:** Can get greasy, not great for oily climates, fewer product options
    

### Water-Based

*   **Best for:** Oily, sensitive, or acne-prone skin; everyday natural looks
    
*   **Pros:** Lightweight, breathable, easy to remove
    
*   **Cons:** Doesn‚Äôt last as long, less pore-smoothing, might not hydrate enough for dry skin
    

- - -

## Layering Rules (a.k.a. How to Avoid Pilling)

The golden rule: **like goes with like.**

*   Water primer + water foundation = seamless
    
*   Silicone primer + silicone foundation = smooth + long-wear
    
*   Oil primer + oil foundation = glowy dream for dry skin
    

What to avoid: Water + silicone. They fight, and you‚Äôll end up with clumps or that weird ‚Äúeraser shavings‚Äù effect. (Been there, hated that.)

- - -

## Real-Life Tips That Actually Help

*   Let each layer (moisturizer, sunscreen, primer) _fully absorb_ before slapping on the next. Five minutes can save you a cakey mess.
    
*   Start with less product‚Äîyou can always add, but too much primer = disaster.
    
*   Don‚Äôt overthink it. If your makeup looks good and lasts, who cares what the base is? (But if it‚Äôs not working, now you know what to check.)
    

- - -

## Pros & Cons Recap

### Pros of Knowing Your Base

*   No more random pilling or sliding makeup
    
*   Helps match products for smoother application
    
*   You‚Äôll save money by not buying incompatible stuff
    

### Cons (aka the ‚Äúugh‚Äù parts)

*   Ingredient lists can be a pain to decode
    
*   Not all products shout their base loud and clear
    
*   Trial and error is still part of the game
    

- - -

## Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, figuring out your foundation/primer base is just another step in getting to know your skin. If you‚Äôre oily and want matte, silicone is your BFF. If you‚Äôre Sahara-dry, oils are your friend. If you just want light, breathable, no-fuss makeup, water-based has your back.

And hey, don‚Äôt stress if you mess it up once or twice. We‚Äôve all layered the wrong primer under the wrong foundation and ended up blotting our faces in the bathroom at work. Makeup is trial and error, and once you nail this base-matching thing, everything else feels a whole lot easier.",1,1758207119.0,BeautyItemsReview,0,1.0,False

I'd noticed lately that my coffee tastes pretty terrible. It's so thin that it's undrinkable. I did do a descaling about 2 months ago with no issues after that.

I really liked the job, except for one coworker who had been there since day one.

When I first started, I thought she was just super cheerful and great with customers. She would smile, chat with people, and make it seem like she really cared. After a while I realized she only acted like that with our regulars. If someone new came in, she was way less friendly and sometimes even cold.

One week she went on vacation and I covered her shifts. I noticed that whenever the regulars came in, they would tip really generously. Our boss had a rule that all tips go into the tip jar so they can be split evenly among everyone. That was the system we all followed. But I realized something strange. I had never actually seen this coworker put anything into the tip jar before. So I decided to check the shop‚Äôs CCTV footage. Sure enough, every time a regular gave her a tip, she slipped it straight into her own pocket. Not once did she put it in the jar.

It suddenly made sense why she was so overly cheerful with certain customers. It was never about being friendly. She was basically putting on an act to get extra money for herself, while the rest of us followed the rules and split everything fairly.

Honestly, I felt so betrayed because I thought she was just a bubbly person, but really she was gaming the system.",125,1758206551.0,coworkerstories,24,0.93,False

So I (27M) have been in a relationship with her (25F) since last 3 years. Everything was fine for first 2 years with normal fights now and then which is normal but my girlfriend has a habit of blocking me and threatening of breaking up after every major fight in which I took my stance. Not generalizing, she is a lawyer and never accepts her mistake and twists and proves me to be the bad person in every fight. 
So, 3 weeks back, we were talking and out of no where subject of cheating came up. She accused me of cheating emotionally when she saw my reply on a fitness influencer's story where she was looking for a freelance video editor. To which I also replied that how she once cheated on me emotionally when she was entertaining her then best friend who was flirting with her (she never accepted her mistake back then either) to which she faught with me and broke up saying that why am I in a relationship with a emotional cheater, blah blah blah. She stonewalled me for the whole next day and later blocked me when I didn't contact her either. It has been a loop that she would block me and I would go to her next day to sort things out and she would unblock me and all that. But I didn't go this time because I didn't do anything wrong here. 
Here is the part where I messed up: After being blocked, I went for a long drive with my brother three times that week after turning off my GPS so that my google shared location doesn't update as I didn't wanted her to react with saying that I couldnt come up to talk to her but I was going out with my brother at night for a coffee after work. So after a week, on a saturday night, I thought that I switched off my location services but I didnt and went out again and she saw me not at home on google maps and called me several times where I didn't pick her calls. The next day, she called me and confronted me, firstly I told her that I fell asleep but later I had to admit that I lied when she told me that she saw my location. She then broke up again and blocked me.
So the past week has been of her unblocking me everyday and having one last conversation where we fight and say a last good bye but she again texts me the next day. I feel she wants me to go and talk to her and make things right but I am so done now after what all things she said to me and my family. What should I do?

1nka1m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nka1m4/shiny_happy_people/,Shiny Happy People,"Lennon‚Äôs knuckles were white on the wheel, the desert sun melting into a bruised horizon behind them. Halle had her boots on the dash, chewing a straw like she was born in a Western. The playlist had long since devolved into static, but neither of them cared. They were chasing the myth of freedom‚Äîsenior year behind them, the whole country ahead.

They rolled into Shiny Town just past dusk, lured by a billboard that shimmered like a mirage:
WELCOME TO SHINY TOWN ‚Äî WHERE EVERY DAY IS A SMILE!

The streets were spotless. Not clean‚Äîsterile. Every house was pastel perfection, like a dollhouse suburbia dipped in bleach. People waved from porches with teeth too white, smiles too wide. It was Stepford with glitter.

‚ÄúWhy do I feel like we just drove into a toothpaste commercial?‚Äù Halle muttered.

They parked near a diner called The Gleam. Inside, the waitress wore a pink gingham dress and a grin that looked stapled to her face. ‚ÄúWelcome, travelers! We‚Äôre so happy you‚Äôre here!‚Äù

Lennon ordered coffee. Halle asked for fries. The waitress nodded, still smiling, and never blinked.

The food came fast. Too fast. The coffee tasted like syrup and the fries were shaped like stars.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs off,‚Äù Lennon whispered.

‚ÄúNo kidding,‚Äù Halle said. ‚ÄúThis place is like Disneyland if Walt had a God complex.‚Äù

They tried to leave after dinner, but the car wouldn‚Äôt start. Lennon popped the hood‚Äîeverything looked fine. Too fine. The engine gleamed like it had been polished by angels.

Then came the knock.

A man in a powder-blue suit stood beside the car, his smile stretching like elastic. ‚ÄúNeed a hand?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo thanks,‚Äù Lennon said.

‚ÄúOh, but we insist,‚Äù the man replied. Behind him, more townsfolk gathered. All smiling. All too shiny.

Halle reached for the tire iron. ‚ÄúBack off.‚Äù

The man‚Äôs smile twitched. ‚ÄúNow now, no need for unpleasantness. You‚Äôll feel better once you‚Äôve joined us. Everyone does.‚Äù

Lennon slammed the hood shut. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not interested.‚Äù

The crowd advanced.

That‚Äôs when the fight started.

Halle swung the tire iron like a bat, cracking the jaw of a woman in a sundress. She didn‚Äôt bleed‚Äîjust crumpled like a mannequin. Lennon grabbed a road flare from the trunk and lit it, waving it like a torch.

‚ÄúBack up!‚Äù he shouted.

The townsfolk hissed, recoiling from the flame. Their smiles faltered, revealing twitching muscles beneath.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not human,‚Äù Halle said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre programmed.‚Äù

They ran. Through alleys lined with plastic hedges, past playgrounds where children laughed in perfect harmony. Every corner brought more smiling faces, more outstretched arms.

‚ÄúJoin us!‚Äù they chanted. ‚ÄúBe happy!‚Äù

Lennon kicked open a church door. Inside, rows of pews faced a giant screen playing R.E.M.‚Äôs ‚ÄúShiny Happy People‚Äù on loop. The congregation sat motionless, eyes glazed, smiles locked.

‚ÄúThis is their god,‚Äù Halle whispered. ‚ÄúPerfection. Joy. Manufactured bliss.‚Äù

They found a fuse box behind the altar. Halle ripped wires with her bare hands. The lights flickered. The music warped.

Outside, the town began to scream.

They sprinted back to the car. Lennon hotwired it with trembling fingers. The engine roared to life.

Townsfolk swarmed, clawing at the windows, their smiles now grotesque masks of desperation.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave!‚Äù one sobbed. ‚ÄúWe need you! You‚Äôll make us complete!‚Äù

Halle threw the flare out the window. It landed in a puddle of gasoline near the diner.

The explosion lit up the night like a firework show from hell.

They peeled out, tires screeching, smoke trailing behind them.

Miles later, they pulled over on a dirt road. The stars above looked real again.

Lennon lit a cigarette with shaking hands. ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù

Halle stared into the dark. ‚ÄúA town that loved happiness more than truth.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt speak for a long time. Just sat there, two rebels with road dust in their lungs and freedom in their veins.

And somewhere behind them, Shiny Town burned.

Posting this to keep myself accountable and just in case it helps anyone else somehow. I am a 5'4"" 31F and I started at 180 lbs 6 weeks ago and am now down to 170lbs, my goal weight is 145. I know that might not be the fast progress people are looking for, but this is my second time trying to lose this weight. The first time I lost this amount of weight I was able to make faster progress but, clearly, that method was not sustainable because... here we are today! lol. 

Truthfully, I still felt healthy and pretty active at 180lbs, but I did notice that my belly (where I carry most of my weight) was starting to make it uncomfortable for me to sit for long periods of time. I also generally didn't like the way I looked, but I never thought I looked fat (body dysmorphia?). Anyway, here are some notes below about my progress.  

\*\*\*

***Initial steps I took when I started to get serious about losing weight 6 weeks ago-***

# Diet:

1) Met with a **nutritionist** covered by my insurance. (No longer have insurance lol but I did get 2 sessions with her). She basically just told me the obvious and said ""make sure to get 100g protein / day"". One particularly helpful thing she did was give me a handout with easy recipes and tell me to use the first month to just focus on which habits were easiest and hardest to adapt/change. 

2) **weighed myself** every day and logged it in my fitness pal app and **logged everything** I ate no matter what it was, but did not restrict food or count calories. 

3) Ate **3 meals a day** and **a snack between each meal.** I can't cook and I hate eating bland food. My 3 meals a day are vegetables (carrotts, green beans, onions, etc) sauteed with 1 tsp oil and I either add chicken or eggs. For flavor, I dump on **Everything Bagel Seasoning!** makes it delicious. 

4) **Drank water** before coffee and before every meal

5) Stopped eating chocolate, ice cream, and any other sugary snack/drink that I love. **Replaced my usual high sugar snack** with fruit, homemade banana peanut butter bars, or graham crackers. The only thing I will **never replace** is my two cups of coffee/day with some kind of cream. 

# Behavior and Movement:

1) signed up for a cheap **gym membership.** Initially, I went **5 days a week, exercising for only 30 minutes and then going home**. I hate going to the gym, so I started slow. 15 minutes of cardio then 15 minutes arms or legs with weights. I now am doing OT fitness 22.5 min runs (about 2 miles) and up to 30 minutes of arms or legs. 

2) walked an average of **5000 steps a day** over the 6 weeks. made sure to track this with apple watch. 

3) After dinner, had **tea with cream and a spoonful of honey** for dessert, and that was the last thing I consumed for the day. 

4) **Stopped watching TV while I ate, and read instead.** 

5) **No junk food in the house**, and made sure to **finish every last ingredient** before going shopping again. I know it's time to go shopping again when the fridge is nice and empty.

6) **Did not eat out,** except I did order a pizza once. 

7) I did **at least some movement every day**. If I couldn't bring myself to go to the gym, I did **yoga at home** or went for a **long walk.** 

8) Put a timer on my social media to **restrict my screen time**

9) ***I always remind myself that I will lose the weight, but that it's a waiting game.*** 

10) **Kept a journal** to track how I felt about my eating that day, and my day in general

# Next Steps

I'm actually not going to start counting calories yet. I'm instead going to try to get my **step count to 10,000/day** and aim for drinking more water. I'm going to **replace one meal a day with a salad.** 

Once I plateau on my weight loss, I will begin to weigh food and count calories. I'm going to give myself another 6 weeks to see what happens by keeping my diet relatively the same and increasing my exercise (now that I'm comfortable in the gym). 

# Things I've noticed

1) It took me awhile to get comfortable exercising, but at about the 30-day mark, my **body can't go without doing something high intensity each day- even if it's only for a few minutes.** 

2) My body doesn't look any different at all, but muscles in back/arms/legs are starting to get a little more definition. 

3) **Limiting screen time has done wonders**? I finish my food slower when I read or am eating with someone else, and I stay full / am less likely to overeat. It's also a lot harder to grab for snacks when you're holding a book up lol 

4) **Establishing other challenges** for myself (writing a book/ applying to new jobs etc) while I try to lose the weight is really helpful and helps me focus less on obsessing over weight/eating. 

5) Learning how to be **patient** is key to weight loss. Patient with yourself, with progress, with results.

To be hunted down, then discarded.¬†

Now I do.

\---

It was the height of summer in the city. The sun bounced off the steel buildings, pinged around large glass storefronts, and seemingly landed directly on my face as I attempted to serve customers coffee. Sweat pooled under my shirt in my lower back, and my cap could no longer contain my overt perspiration, as beads of liquid streamed past my temples.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry for the heat, ma‚Äôam‚Äù I apologised to the flustered customer, who was getting redder every second, a combo of both heat and anger. ‚ÄúOur A/C has been on the fritz, can I offer you an ice water on the house?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSure, but it‚Äôll boil over soon enough‚Äù she muttered under her breath, accepting my meagre compensation as she accepted defeat and shuffled down the counter.¬†

I understood her frustration, but part of me wanted to rip off my soaked hat, throw it in her face and scream ‚Äútry working for eight hours for minimum wage in this sweatbox!‚Äù Alas, it wasn‚Äôt in my nature. It was too hot to bother anyway.¬†

More sticky hours passed, dozens of iced coffees passed slickly from my hands to the patrons, and finally it was time to call it a day.¬†

‚ÄúSee you tomorrow boss‚Äù, Moira yelled as she whisked herself out the door, desperate to get away from the heat and the closing shift duties. Boss is a stretch‚ÄîI‚Äôm the assistant manager but that title only comes with a paltry pay-rise and more responsibility. I set about cashing up and locking doors, when I noticed something as I cleared the long forgotten corner table.¬†

A large gnarled brown mug sat squarely in the centre of the table, looking strangely like the bark of a tree, seemingly untouched yet empty. I stared at it for a second. It was far too humid today for anyone to have ordered a hot drink, and besides, our mugs are white and boring, not like this ornate nature-inspired ceramic. Inspecting it further, I lifted the mug, unsurprised to find it empty of liquid but not completely void of contents.¬†

At the bottom was a small bean. Green and shaped like the offspring of a coffee bean and a cashew. Without thinking I pocketed it in the pouch of my apron, placed the mug in the dishwasher, and finished my nightly duties before closing the shutters and heading home.¬†

\---

Morning came with some relief. I had the day off and I was about to spend all day doing my favourite thing - gardening. I lived in a ground floor apartment, rented from a wealthy second cousin and therefore affordable for my crappy salary. The best part about it was the small garden adorning the back, only accessible from my apartment. The weather had cooled impressively overnight, and I armed myself with gloves, trowels, spades, and seeds, and set about preparing my modest summer crop of veggies and flowers.¬†

After a couple of hours, I took a break, knees aching from kneeling and dirt rubbed on my face from careless swiping of my brow, and sat with a lemonade on my back porch, surveying my work so far.¬†

It was wash day, and I‚Äôd laid some of my clothes out to dry on the rack outside, taking advantage of the season. Suddenly I remembered‚Äîthat weird seed! I placed my lemonade on the floor next to me, leaving a few drops at the bottom of the glass, and glanced over at my apron. Surely the seed wasn‚Äôt still in the pouch? It was.¬†

Perhaps high on the scent of fertiliser and weed killer, I decided to plant it in a special pot I‚Äôd picked up at a garage sale last fall, giving it pride of place right next to the back window. I was excited about what it might grow, but not na√Øve enough to recognise that it probably wouldn‚Äôt grow at all, and was most likely some weird candy I‚Äôd never seen before.¬†

Still, a few hours later I was pleased with my gardening work. Only a few seeds remained in the zip lock baggie I used to keep them in, kept alive by the hope they may end up in the soil along with their buddies someday. I went inside to take a shower, binge watch TV, and order a pizza. A reward for a job well done.¬†

I always save the pizza crusts for last. I like to use them to wipe up the pizza grease and any cheese that escaped the first culling. I know it sounds gross. Tonight I was too tired to finish though, and left one solitary crust alone, doomed to be trashed without any pastry brethren by its side.¬†

I yawned, threw the blanket off my lap and made my way to the bedroom. The couch was often my bed on the weekend when I was too lazy to move, but tonight something compelled me to head to my bed and get a good night's sleep.¬†

\---

I awoke to heavy rainfall. So thunderous it reminded me of machine gun fire, and jolted me awake in a panic. I swung my legs out of bed, padded over to the window, and opened the curtains. Great sheets of rain were bathing the city, so thick were the drops that it made it hard to see shapes. Oh well, I thought. Rain will be good for my crops.¬†

With that thought, I went back to sleep, dreaming of a huge, lush garden where I could forget my dull life, surrounded by exotic flowers of all colours and shapes, so many that I could lay back and disappear forever within their rainbow of petals.¬†

\---

Bleary eyed and aching, the sunlight streaming through the window woke me earlier than I‚Äôd have liked. I rubbed my sore calves‚Äìclearly I overdid it with the gardening. Rubbing my eyes, I slouched my aching feet into my slippers and made my way to the kitchen for a caffeinated pick-me-up. 

What I saw was entirely unbelievable.

Just beyond the kitchen window, the strange seed had shot up overnight, producing a large, thick green stalk; it must have been 3 feet wide. I ran outside to get a closer look, and craned my neck to take in its monstrous height. The plant stretched into the sky, beyond the clouds, and it sprouted spikes every foot or so up the stalk. Almost like a ladder, but one that resembled a terrifying monster-cactus rather than something used for cleaning the gutters.¬†

As I stared up at the horrifyingly huge plant, I stopped to notice the weather. It was still, cool, yet a mist was descending over my garden and the city skyline. A sudden breeze swept over me, humming as it did so. I couldn‚Äôt hear any words, but something within that wind was whispering to me. Compelling me to climb the plant and discover what lay at the peak.¬†

Without missing a beat, or changing out of my PJs, I placed a hand on one of the protruding spikes, and lifted myself up, one spine at a time. As I climbed higher, seeing the roof of my apartment building much faster than I anticipated, I noticed my hands becoming slicker. The spines had been sticking me with smaller spikes, leaving my hands bleeding from numerous tiny holes. Somehow I couldn‚Äôt feel the pain, or didn‚Äôt want to. All I wanted to do was climb.¬†

As I entered the clouds, the air became thinner, leaving me gasping with every stretch to reach the next spike with my bloodied fingers. But eventually, I made it to a plateau, where the tree extended into a large green surface. I collapsed at the top, and didn‚Äôt recover in time to notice what was approaching me. As I lay on my side, gasping for air, a large shadow covered me before I could collect myself.¬†

Turning around slowly to the sound of deep, guttural breathing, I saw him. A giant of a man, 20 feet tall at least, with rippling muscles bursting through his tattered clothing. I froze in fear, and stayed frozen as he wordlessly picked me up with no effort at all, and carried me across the green landscape to a large hole in the ground.¬†

Survival instincts kicked in. I knew I had no chance to overpower him but I began kicking my legs as hard as I could into his ribs (gardening injuries permitting), and flailing my arms to escape his grip. It was no use, he didn‚Äôt even react to my attempts, despite me using all my strength. His dark eyes didn‚Äôt stray from his path.¬†

\---

He dropped me into the hole. It was deep, dank, and stunk of manure and death, and I landed with a thud that made me yelp with pain upon impact on the hard dirt floor. He leaned over the hole, stared at me for a few seconds, then walked away, his footsteps shaking the floor.¬†

The walls of the hole were jagged, but the mud was too slippery to try to climb, as I learned almost immediately. 

The walls cast shadows against the corners, shadows that were hiding secrets.¬†",3,1758205977.0,nosleep,4,0.8,False

I'll pour out everything today.

Maybe I've been like this for 5 years or so. Ykw I don't even have the energy to type it out so I won't try my best.

Each breath taken, every step taken, every grain of food touching my tongue and words that comes out of me in any form factor; feels meaningless. I loathe loud noises and places where I might know people more than 2. 

I watch as time slips. Days feel like seconds and seconds feel like forever. NOTHING brings me joy anymore. 

I like coffee, Black with no sugar.

I was getting on track some time ago but now all this feels meaningless. Living.

I don't want to seek help. I'm typing this because I'm bored.

I think I am a burden to everyone around me. And that connections in general are a big burden. I am in a losing spree of everything. Weak, dumb, ugly, short, mentally unstable, insomniac, poor. I think I might have bipolar disorder. 

I suck at every hobby as well, too slow improvement like a turtle. I've been drawing since forever and I can just copy stuff at basic level and always with shit ass mistakes. Tried music on my own and couldn't even play anything but few open base cords after practicing so hard my fingers bleed for months. Picked up writing and sucked hard at it too. 

Basically I'd call myself a human trash. I have four limbs yet I suck at things some people master with a toe.

Never had a friend close enough I can share this with because I know it will be a burden to them or I'll just bother them with all this fuckery.

I smoke to cope. And not much that too is because of my weak lungs. I started coughing like a grandma once I smoked a whole pack in a day. 

I don't believe in anything paranormal or religious. Just a waste of space.

Shout out to radiohead> creep is my favorite.

Don't even understand emotions. Joy or superiority, sad or disgusted, angry or confused. wth am I even doing.

To sum it all up, I think it might be better to just die once and for all.

My family would be at ease with knowing the unwanted burden is gone. The food I won't eat would go to someone worthy. And the oxygen I breath will be used for something good. A ton of resources will be saved as well.   

At max i'll handle this for 2 years at most cuz I know some people will get traumatized because how attached they are to me. 

In the meantime i'll try to cut myself off from my friends to the point they hate me. I am generous like that.",2,1758205911.0,SuicideWatch,1,1.0,False

* Wood
* Stone (not cobblestone, stone)
* Livingrock and livingwood
* Potatoes, carrots, coffee, wheat, canola, tomatoes, flax, and nether warts
* Skeletons, spiders, creepers, zombies, endermen, wither skeletons, blazes using DE Spawners
* Sheep, cows, chickens, and pigs using spawners
* Eggs
* Pink slime and liquid meat
* Ores using lasers and lenses

* Using a RS network to store items, connected to a drawer controller for storing bulk items from farms, and connected to a black hole controller for bulk storage of liquids
* Obtained creative flight using Astral Sorcery perks
* Obtained OP self repairing armor from Botania
* Have 4 full health bars
* Reduced hunger from Astral Sorcery perks
* Super speed using a combination of Botania and Astral Sorcery
* Farmed all bosses in the pack including vanilla, Botania and Twilight Forest bosses

I feel like I'm at a pretty good spot but I've only completed the beginner technology chapter and about half of the advanced chapter. I've ran out of ideas of what to do in the pack.

  
I am thinking of three possibilities:

1. Automate more things, although this would just be more of the same stuff I've already done and I wouldn't learn anything new, it'd feel more like a chore
2. Just craft everything else I need to complete the chapters, read about what they do and move on to another pack

1nk9h2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1nk9h2k/finally_got_to_try_a_nitro_milk_stout/,Finally got to try a nitro milk stout,"Took y‚Äôall‚Äôs suggestion and tried me some of Left Hand Brewing Co.‚Äôs Nitro Milk Stout, here‚Äôs a quick review!

This beer was very tasty, I particularly enjoyed the chocolate milk qualities it had. The nitro infusion certainly made for a smooth and creamy texture. It wasn‚Äôt too sweet, reminiscent of a semi sweet to maybe a low percentage dark chocolate flavor. There were also coffee notes somewhere in there, as well as a slight nuttiness.

It is about 6% ABV so slightly higher than average, perfect ratio of hops and malt. Made for a very well rounded and rich flavor overall.

I don't feel great so I was chilling. Well we got to the coffee drive thru and ordered. The barista must not have seen me because she starts flirting with my husband. He's 6'5 so she starts asking him about how difficult it must be to fit in beds, she asked him if he could fit in a queen bed. And he looked back at me and then she asked him if he had a kid or ""little one"" back there. He said no just my wife. Her face went from üòÅ to üòÖüò¨. And she gave us the rest of our order. And I'm after that my husband let me know that other black women hit on him and now his chest is puffed out because I didn't believe him. ",0,1758204912.0,blackladies,42,0.38,False
