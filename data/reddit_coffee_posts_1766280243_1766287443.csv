First time:

I was given a sample from my gastro and took it for about one week. Before treatment, my main symptoms were burping and bloating. After taking rifaximin, those symptoms stayed, but my symptoms worsened overall. I became extremely gassy, and my gas smelled like rotten eggs. That lasted for several months. After about 4–5 months, the gas smell returned to normal, and I was left again mainly with bloating and burping.

Second time:

I wanted to try a full 14-day course of rifaximin, but given the high cost of the medication and uncertainty about whether it would work for me, I chose to take a generic version from India so I could complete the full course. I was able to take it for the full 14 days.

A similar pattern happened again, I became very gassy with strong sulfur-smelling gas. My stool consistency also changed significantly. I started having many small, very skinny, long stools, multiple bowel movements that looked thin and stringy (I jokingly called them “snake poops,” lol). This stool pattern has been ongoing since July until now.

Current / third time:

I finally completed a breath test and was diagnosed with methane-dominant SIBO. My doctor prescribed rifaximin plus neomycin. I am again taking the generic rifaximin from India, along with neomycin.

This time, the strong, foul-smelling gas and stool odor are finally gone. For the first time in months, my bowel movements feel normal. My stools are:

	•	More formed and solid

	•	Normal thickness

	•	I’m having at least two bowel movements a day

	•	Previously, I could only have a bowel movement if I drank coffee

Overall, both my stool consistency and odor have improved significantly. I currently have about five days left in this treatment course.

My question:

Given that my bowel movements and odor have improved so much, but I’m still burping quite a bit throughout the day, does this suggest the treatment is working? And is it normal for some symptoms (like burping) to linger even if methane SIBO is being addressed?",1,1766286898.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

Some Party

I’d been feeling against the grain when I purchased the dog mask. Against the grain where you enjoy being strange and a little scandalous, just because it’s scandalous. I was going to wear it jogging in the colder months, see the looks on faces. As many times as I’d considered wearing it over the years since the purchase, I’d never yet hit that day when I said, ‘Today I will do it.’ So I forgot about it.

The night of the office Christmas party I was feeling against the grain. I was feeling very against the grain. I didn’t want to go. I wanted to be contrary. What could be more against the grain than just not being there when I’m supposed to be there? Then I remembered I had that dog mask and that it would go against all the grains. Worse than not being there, I could be there and have people wish I weren’t. I decided I would wear the dog mask and I decided not to question my decisions going forward.

I then wore a Christmas cloak and hat over the latex suit that came with the mask that I might become a Christmas dog instead of a pervert. This operation was meant to be silly fun and nothing more: I would walk into the party and people would be guessing and, a little scandalized, they would ask, ‘Who is that? Who is the Christmas dog?’ or ‘Who is the guy in the dog costume? Is that Kevin?’ No, ma’am, I’m not Kevin! I’m Jared. They just think I might be Kevin. Eventually, through a process of elimination, they’ll call me out, I’ll remove the mask and it’ll be an amusing moment in the night.

I also wondered how liberating the mask might be. Ordinarily I’m very reserved. I could see a new me emerging from behind the mask, gregarious and energetic, dancing and singing without reserve. I would do karaoke. Nobody would mind. The Christmas dog must do karaoke. The thought was exciting. I wouldn’t mind being a new me, a new, unblocked me.

I could think of many reasons not to go through with wearing this particular outfit, however. Or indeed with wearing any costume at all to a party that is not explicitly a costume party. Yet I could not countermand the decision. That was the rule. I had decided. I was in my car and on my way. Woof, woof.

Even in the parking lot, when I felt most compelled to retreat, I refused to let myself counter the decision. I felt my legs carrying me forward through the glass doors as though they (the legs) weren’t even mine.

Fortunately, my entrance went much as I’d hoped. I heard gasps, giggles and our director loudly declaring, “Oh my god, okay.” The words of the low-key scandalized. I was at first worried they all knew exactly who I was, that they were saying “Jared is being weird and making everyone uncomfortable.” I was being weird, yet hopefully nobody was uncomfortable. Then I worried that, even though nobody knew it was me, everyone hated it and wished ‘this person’ would stop being an attention whore and ruining the party.

My worries were misplaced. My co-workers were earnestly trying to guess who I was. They laughed as I replied only in woofs. They playfully asked me to fetch food from the snacks tray and asked if I was microchipped. I was the center of attention, giving everyone some excitement in a dull party. 

I was stopped by Supriya from marketing. She was saying things like, “Hey puppy, look at you,” and asking if I was ready to party. She was already drunk and the party had just begin. 

Bill Bakkus insisted on telling me about how crazy things would get in previous office parties. He’d told me all this the day before, but I couldn’t let on now. I just had to listen to him and make dog sounds. They hadn’t had one in ten years, he was saying, because those parties got Out Of Hand. He said it like that, like it was a special concept. He was looking at my outfit and saying, ‘Things could get Out Of Hand.’ I gestured, ‘I dunno,’ which made him even more sure, ‘Ohhhh yeah, things can get Out Of Haaaand.’ He intimated this wasn’t the first dog costume he’d seen at a Christmas party. I don’t know. I went sniffing elsewhere. That was a nice trick I could do. I could pretend I was smelling something and leave boring conversations without offending anyone. They thought it was funny. 

I grabbed a spiked eggnog, heavily spiked as it happens, and wandered idly around the party. I could slip in an out of conversations with no problem. Nobody minded me hearing what they were saying or intruding. I was more of a mascot than a man. The novelty had worn off. They just accepted me. Or most did. Some seemed annoyed I showed up, like I wanted to take all their attention.

Soon I was just an idiot wandering around dressed like a dog, unable to join in on conversations because I could only bark. There was no dancing or karaoke, just standing around with drinks and snacks. I guess I could just take the costume off, but that didn’t feel right. That’d be even more awkward. Then I wasn’t taking the costume off because people wanted the mystery solved; I’d be taking it off because I gave up on my stupid schtick when it wasn’t getting me attention anymore. I didn’t want to be that guy. 

So I stood in the middle of the office as everyone ignored me drinking my nog. Dog with a nog. Nog dog. I wondered if I could do something with that. Make it funny. I guess I could start speaking. Just a few words to get people wondering, ‘Whose voice is that?’ So I walked past some groups saying, “Mmm, nog” and “Dog like nog.” 

“Doesn’t sound like Kevin,” Trace Yew said and Rik pointed out Kevin was ‘just over there’ so it can’t be Kevin.

For some reason Nancy our payroll analyst, who I always considered an uptight bitch, casually mentioned that she’d gotten a Brazilian after I told her “Nog got dis dog.” I thanked her for sharing and went to get some snacks.

Gerald and Karen, two managers, were also grabbing snacks while talking trash about everyone, each time leaning toward me and saying, “Don’t tell anyone, but…” Apparently they’d heard Bill Bakkus was going to be ‘let go.’ Who would tell these asshats anything so sensitive? I barked at them causing Gerald to drop his deviled egg.

At this point I felt compelled to start speaking in complete sentences because I still wasn’t getting anywhere. I repeated things I’d heard Gerald and Karen saying, but I deliberately named them as my source, like, “Gerald said he saw Jeff going to the server closet with Heidi, just sayin’.” 

I was making more efforts to go against the grain. Yet I couldn’t offend, upset, or scandalize anyone. We were all getting drunker. Dancing finally started. Someone had a bluetooth speaker and put on some Beastie Boys. I was dancing with my fourth nog. My cloak was almost coming off making my latex dog suit fully visible. This should have been an HR violation, but our HR business partner was too busy twerking in front of me. I called her “My nog bitch” to see what would happen. Just more twerking.

When I went for a rest, Krissy (our director), Gerald, and Kevin cornered me. They demanded I explain who the heck I was, because they were pretty sure everyone invited was counted. At this point I went ahead and told them. “Okay, okay,” I said with a grin in my voice, “it’s me, Jared.” I even started giving them a hard time about not guessing.

“Seriously,” Krissy said, “who are you?”

“Jared,” I answered.

“Jared just walked in, so we know that’s not true, not kidding around anymore.”

I looked to the entrance. A man had just walked in who looked a lot like me. It was pretty uncanny. He was wearing a black Calvin Klein overcoat just like mine and CK driving gloves just like mine. He had a secret santa gift in my hand. I hadn’t brought a secret santa gift even though I was supposed to. 

I watched speechless as I recognized my mannerisms. I felt dizzy and my skin was clammy beneath the latex. I don’t know why I felt that way. So what, they didn’t believe I was me. I could easily prove it to them. I could just show them. It’s stupid. 

But who was this guy? Did someone arrive in an exceptionally high-quality Jared costume? Was that a decision they’d made tonight? What was his purpose? The part of me that’s watched too much television thought he might be a dog wearing a me costume.

“Hellooooo?” Krissy was pressing.

I shrank away from my inquisitors. My escape wasn’t as smooth as before. Now they wondered why I was being cagey. I tried to make it good-natured, pointing to the snacks.

What I wanted to do was get near this fake me. He was gregarious, talking to everybody with a big dumb smile. Did I look like that? Look at the double chin. I approached the group he was talking to and heard him talking about the book he’d been reading. It was the same book I was reading. How many people could possibly be reading the novelization of Ferris Bueller’s Day Off at a given time? 

When he saw me, he looked shocked, bemused, and a little embarrassed. Because, no doubt, he knew it was me and wasn’t sure if I was going to make a big deal of this. 

“That’s some flex,” he said, as I might’ve said. “I think I have the same costume at home.”

I stared at him with cold, canid eyes. He nodded then went to the snacks table. He was not wearing a disguise. That was flesh and blood. He was me. And he was more me than me, because here I was in this stupid dog costume and he was just letting me hang all out there.

I didn’t understand how this was possible. Several movie plots occurred to me, from The Matrix to Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey, but this was real. I was in real life and a dog costume while this was happening.

I put the egg nog down. I had to get to a mirror. I had to take off the mask and see I’m still me. Then we can confront this doppelganger business. 

I pushed through clusters of my coworkers and past Krissy to get to the bathroom. There I found a bunch of people milling in front of the door. I tried to get past them but was told, “This is a line, Rover.” Except it wasn’t a line. It was a cluster. If it’s a line, fucking line up!

I muttered, “Emergency,” and kept pushing. What were they gonna do?

Inside, there are more men milling about. I didn’t know these assholes. Who were these people? I’ve worked here for 14 years and I knew none of them. Why did they all have to piss at this moment? What was wrong with these people’s bladders?

I wanted everyone to just go away so I could quietly look at who I am in the mirror without being observed. And they had to fucking exist at this moment.

I pushed back out of the bathroom growling at strangers. The only person I recognized in the ‘line’ was Clint the IT guy. He looked uncomfortable.

I could try my best in one of the windows facing the dark part of the parking lot. That was a good plan, except two shitbirds had to be sitting on the sill eating brownies. They weren’t talking, just sitting there staring forward eating brownies. Go eat your fucking brownies somewhere else, fucking getting in the fucking way! I just wanted a moment with a reflective surface. Why can’t anyone just fuck off and let me have a reflective surface?

I looked back and saw our HR partner pointing my way while talking to this other Jared. I just wanted to get away now. Just get out of here. On my way I was stopped by Krissy and one of the security guards–who was a 75 year old woman named Fay, so let’s not get excited. 

“Everybody is accounted for, so who are you?” the director asked.

I shook my head. 

“You need to take off your mask.”

A crowd had gathered around. I didn’t want to take off the mask. I didn’t care if this guy was an impostor. I just wanted to go home. I tried to explain to them:

“I just thought it’d be fun to come in this silly mask, have you all guess who I am for a bit, wonder, create some mystery, and then we have a laugh when I pull off the mask. That’s it. This isn’t what I thought it’d be. Just let me go home.”

“No,” Krissy snapped. “No, I don’t think I will.”

“Wait,” someone said. 

The fake Jared sidled up beside her. This was it. Now let’s see what this is about.

“Let me just escort him out of here, he hasn’t hurt anyone and we did get a chuckle out of it, right?”

Somehow that intervention worked. He actually did escort me out with his hand on my back. Out in the cold, in front of the building, he quietly told me, “This is my life now, you’re going to have to go. In the coming days, things are going to get dark and cold. There’ll be more orphans than smiles, more shit than food. Start preparing now.”

I was shivering and not just from the cold. I didn’t know what was going on. Who was this person?

“And one last bit of advice. If you ever come to a town called Linlormer, keep in mind, wear the fox hat.”

“What?”

He went back inside with no further explanation. My car was gone. The building looked different. It wasn’t the same building I’d entered that night and had worked in for 14 years. It had changed from a 15 story gray building to an 8 story brown. The air had a tangy scent that burned my nostrils. The cars were models I’d never seen before, like what's a Powys Yazoo? An SUV that had boat anchors next to the wheels. 

Everything was different.

I asked about W Punta Cana a few months ago, no one really knew much about it. I ended up booking it via Costco travel and I’d like to give a review so it can help others make a decision. 

Overall rating 5/10

Pros: beautiful property, very esthetic. Large infinity pool that overlooks beach. Drinks were not watered down. Rooms are large, modern. Spa is very nice. 

Cons: everything else.
Food is meh. Average at best. Options are very limited, they have 4 restaurants but only 3 open at a time. The food options in the restaurants 
 itself are limiting. Gets repetitive 

But nothing is worse than the SERVICE. Holy moly I never seen such poor service at any hotel period.
They were not properly trained by marriot and even the 2 general managers on site ADMITTED the service is lacking and they’re working on training.
Mind you, they’ve been open since August. 

There is absolutely 0 regard for anyone’s food restrictions. 
Vegetarian? Things are mislabeled and not vegetarian and people in our group found it after they bit into it.
Gluten free? Not actually gluten free. Mislabeled. 
Shellfish allergy? NOPE, sorry there’s hidden shellfish. Unfortunately I found out the hard way for the shellfish allergy 

I understand going to an all inclusive in another country has some risks for cross contamination, etc… but literal pieces of meat/ shellfish/gluten in things that are ether mislabeled OR the waiter/waitress claim that those things are free of those things and they aren’t and the only apology you get is “whoopsie I missed that”. Literally

The other problem is the miscommunication and language barrier.
Lemme just say, I understand we’re in their country and we should probably know their language. However, marriot is targeting mostly Americans and Canadians to come down there…. You’d think they hire people who are bilingual or attests that can get by. 
Most of the staff did not know any English…. And it made things so difficult. 

Other examples of poor service: waiting 30-40 min for coffee at breakfast, cleaning staff not replenishing toiletries when they’re clearly empty. We asked a few times to the staff directly and the front desk and never got things restocked.  

I’ve stayed at other W properties in America, and international too. Obviously not all inclusive (the Punta Cana is the first actually). 
And I’m stunned how bad things were.

Hope this helps for anyone thinking about it

I’m currently in Goa and thought I’d put this post out to see if anyone here is around and attending Goato Meet M26. I’m specifically looking to connect with female attendees who might already be in Goa or planning to be there for the meet.
A little context about me I’m just spending some time in Goa, enjoying the place, the vibe, and meeting new people when possible. Since events like Goato Meet M26 bring together people with similar interests, I felt this would be a good opportunity to connect with someone who’s also attending and open to a casual, friendly meetup. Nothing complicated or awkward just a simple catch-up, maybe coffee, a walk, or a quick chat during the event if you’re comfortable.
I know Reddit can sometimes be cautious about meetup posts, so to be clear: this is purely about connecting in a respectful and normal way. No pressure, no expectations, and absolutely fine if you prefer to keep things brief or just chat online first. Safety and comfort always come first.
If you’re a female attendee of Goato Meet M26 and you’re already in Goa (or arriving soon), feel free to comment or DM if this sounds okay to you. Even exchanging event tips or plans is totally fine.
Thanks for reading, and hope everyone attending has a great time at the meet!",1,1766285883.0,DatingInIndia,1,1.0,False

And it makes me feel incredibly alone, because I genuinely love coffee. Not in a “it pays my bills” way, but in a deep, nerdy, lifelong way. I’ve summered on coffee plantations. I have ancestors who worked on coffee plantations. I go to seminars *for fun* because I’m obsessed with these weird little beans and everything they go through to end up in a cup. (Yes, even the unhinged stuff. Looking at you, lemur poop beans.)

Everyone around me seems to treat coffee like a dead end, like something you end up doing when your “real plan” falls apart. But I don’t see it that way at all. To me, coffee is a successful luxury. Something that people choose to love and keep available through trade every single day, something that connects agriculture, science, culture, and hospitality in this really beautiful way. When countries stop having freely available coffee, that's one of the first signs of national instability. They make coffee substitutes in war. That's how much people love coffee.

I actually want to build a career here. One day, I want to be a coffee roaster. I want to understand the beans inside and out, control the process, and do it right. But I keep hitting walls. I can’t find roasters willing to train me because my previous boss had a lovely habit of *not paying his roasters*, which somehow follows me around like a curse.

What hurts the most is realizing how many people take this job out of resentment. They’re angry they’re here, angry at customers, angry at the drinks they’re making. And if I’m being honest? I can taste it. Every one of their ""cuppas"" feels like it’s made with hate instead of love. I get it. The economy is rough. But I'd like just a moment to declare how much I loooove these silly bitter beans.

It's a great concept, you donate $5 to charity as an entry fee and then get paired up with someone from your country to exchange cookies with.  I've done it for a few years, and have received some delicious treats.  

Went through the process this year, and baked three kinds of cookies and bagged some savory homemade snacks as well.  It was in line with what I'd exchanged previous years, 2 dozen cookies plus snacks.  It all fit into a standard postage box. 

So the other day I received my own box.  It was late at night, and I knew my family would want some, but I was also snacky so I popped the end of the box open and grabbed a bag with six cookies. I had three before bed that night and three with my morning tea.  

Later I went to grab the box and fully unpack whatw as left. It had a bag of coffee in it, and a store bought chocolate bar.   I'd eaten all of the cookies - all six of them - without realizing.

I don't know. I guess there's risk to the concept as a whole.  But this is the first year I feel what I put into that box was a waste of time and effort.

1prvrek,https://i.redd.it/1mco5lkw0h8g1.jpeg,Heart of Winter,"Hello! I just wanted to share my submission for the Longest Night Bounty.

Premise:

The world outside is disappearing beneath a relentless, unnatural white-out. For weeks, your small town has been battered by severe snowstorms that defy every weather forecast, trapping residents in a perpetual, freezing twilight just days before Christmas. While the locals whisper jokes about legendary figures, you discover the truth is far more intimate and dangerous. 

Jack Frost:

Once a joyful spirit of winter who loved the world and the goddess of Spring, Jack Frost has been reduced to a cynical, sardonic wanderer. Following a devastating breakup that shattered his sense of purpose, his lighthearted charms have turned into a lethal, spiteful cold. He is no longer interested in bringing the beauty of the season; he is a man drowning in his own heartbreak, using his elemental powers to stall the cycle of the world out of pure, wounded spite.

Inside a quiet local coffee shop, the air has turned bone-chillingly cold, centered around a single, heartbroken stranger. The blizzard isn't a weather pattern; it is a manifestation of divine grief, and unless the ice in this man's soul begins to thaw, the winter may never end.

The next day started just like any other, coffee and brekky to start the day, doing pre-labs for our upcoming classes and taking down notes before lectures. That particular day I had arranged a follow up meeting with Wanda Cui, not only to discuss academic matters, but personal matters on our discovery. After getting through our morning classes, Steph and I met outside our favourite on-campus café, The Freckled Duckling, to gossip and to plan the rest of the day.

The café sat on the edge of the campus near a man-made stream that flowed into one of the many duck ponds here and at the botanic gardens. Today it was relatively quiet as more and more students were finishing up and studying for their exams as they loomed just around the corner. We both ordered lattes and a small meal to share as we sat under the shade of an umbrellaed table.

“Are you sure you can’t come with me to the meeting?” I asked, stirring my latte as Steph finished hers.

“I would if my lab practical wasn’t in the way, if only our timetables were one-to-one.”

“I’m just- not sure how it’ll go.” I fidgeted with my hands before Steph reached over the table and held them.

“You’ll be fine, you’re just going to check in on your grades and that rock we found-“

“C’mon, you know it’s not just a rock…” I blurted, before realising how I sounded.

“I know Claire, I just don’t know what to think of it. But she will.”

We finished up and I left for the Nick Lowe building, which now has tape and a parked security truck on one side as I weaved through the maze of fossils and artefacts on my way to Wanda Cui’s lab. I knocked on the door and waited an uncomfortably long duration before I was greeted at the door and let in. Her laboratory was far messier than when we last visited. Notes and delicate apparatus was strewn across the desks and bench tops, with a half-hidden object in the middle of the room cloaked under a tarp.

“I apologise for the current condition of the lab, but I have been spending day and night examining this artefact that you two brought me.” She exclaimed as she had our discovery on a bench atop a crimson cloth. I looked over and she eyed me cautiously as I went back to where I was standing.  

“Where is your friend by the by?” she inquired.

“Oh- she’s busy in another class so it’s- just me today.” I replied quietly.

“I see…” She said simply, as she wandered over to the large, covered object. Her body positioned in such a way that I could not peer under the veil. Something about her seemed- off today. Her hair seemed frizzled and the way the skin under her eyes sagged made her feel much older than I knew she was. She almost looked like another person entirely with how she was letting herself go.

“You… working on something there?” I questioned. To which she sighed silently as she faced me.

“Claire can I be honest with you?” she said coldly.

“I- uh, sure, go ahead.” I said, my voice coming out a bit shaky as she closed the distance between us quickly.

“I do apologise in advance for this, though I figured it would be better to present this to you in person. You must have heard of what happened by now, I am sure of it. Which is why after today, I will unfortunately not be able to provide any more insight into the artefact. I do apologise for these… unforeseen circumstances…”

“But- Well can we have it back then? So that we can-“

“No-“ She interrupted sternly “while you did retrieve this, I and the university are not liable for the loss of any goods brought onto the premises. Since you delivered this for the purpose of research outside of university grounds and conditions, it stays in my possession until further notice.”  
I stood there stunned, who did she think she was? Taking our discovery and keeping it for herself. I approached the bench with our artefact, only for her to position herself in between, blocking me.

“Claire Wilson, have I not made myself clear?” She stated firmly.

“You can’t just- take what we gave you and treat us this way!” I refuted, my voice beginning to rise.

“I understand how this may make you feel, but leave this to the professionals. You risk damaging a major archaeological find with significant implications, and that is a risk I am not willing to make.” She lectured, despite being shorter than me, she posed an intimidating and overwhelming presence. She continued.

“I think it’s time for you to leave.”

I made a point by looking down at her, her tired eyes glaring into mine with black pools of venom bubbling beneath them before I turned away, heading to the door before my emotions got the best of me.

“Have fun sleeping at night, cunt-“ I bellowed, before slamming the door on the way out. I stormed out and saw red. I sat by a small waterfall in a quiet spot on campus to calm down, attempting to revise some notes as I glazed over the content from the previous weeks.

I must have sat there for half an hour before I saw someone approaching. At first, I was unsure if they were familiar, until familiar greasy black hair revealed itself under Mat’s hooded face.

“Mat? I didn’t recognise you- you look-“

“Like shit? I know, but I wanted to make sure that you’re okay.” He asked wearily. I looked down at my notes and put them away.

“Yeah, nah, its’ just- lots’ going on at the moment.”

“I feel you there- It’s all just happened at once.” He said, yawning loudly. A moment of silence soon followed before I interjected.

“Are you alright mate? You- you worried us at the library before.” I said softly. He looked at me solemnly, like a lost soul.

“Yeah, yeah I’m okay. I’m sorry for how- I acted then. I just- I was stressed and I felt like that I was the only one doing something…”

As much as the hygienic side of me screamed against it, I leaned in and patted him on the back. Doing my best to avoid getting a whiff of his body odour. An awkward stillness followed, though just as I was beginning to regret my decision, he patted me back.

“Thanks Claire… I appreciate it. I’ll let you get back to studying, I’m going to pick up some books from the library.” That intrigued me, since Mat never took study seriously once in his life.

“Oh- well I hope you find what you’re looking for.” I called out, he looked back and waved at me before walking away. I studied for a bit longer before meeting up with Steph after her lab had concluded. Not wanting to waste the few hours left of daylight, we both headed out to our favourite spot. At the site where we first met, with erosion and age chipping away slowly at our childhood, yet it stands strong to this day.

The pathway up was missing some stones, either washed away by torrential downpour or stolen. Numerous names chipped and spray painted onto rock littered the cliff walls. Beer cans, bottles and fast-food wrappers stuffed into the cracks and crevasses, the filth always doubling the next day no matter how often we clear it.

“Sorry I wasn’t with you Claire- If I knew how badly the meeting would go, I would’ve been there.” She spoke while looking out at the sea, the sky behind us becoming pink and orange as the sun started to set behind the mountains.

“It’s not your fault Steph; everyone is acting strangely all of a sudden. I’m starting to feel like Mat.” She giggled and I smiled as I held her hand.

“Did you know he’s gay?” I added. Steph smiled and looked away.

“I had a feeling; the signs were there I guess. Do you remember the time back on school camp he got his camera confiscated for filming Stephen getting dressed?” I laughed a little before reality hit us both. Though I do not believe in ghosts, I felt like I trod over his grave and cursed myself.

“I hope they find him, his family deserves closure, don’t they?” Steph asked, before I nodded. I heard my phone ring as I sifted through my pockets to grab it, it was Lachie, I answered.

*“Hey Claire, I was gonna pop by Bailey’s place, you coming?”* Though he wasn’t speaking loudly, I could see Steph looking at me from the corner of my eye as I replied quietly.

“Yeah, sure I’ll be with you soon.” Before hanging up quickly. The whole mood shifted during the phone call as Steph looked down at the surging waters below.

“I’ll meet you back at the apartment, hun.” I said, getting up as she stayed sitting at her spotting, watching the waves roll over.

“I love you-“ I called out, but I heard no reply.

\-

Lachlan picked me up in his beaten Camry, the whole ride over to Baileys’ house I was quiet, and I think Lachlan knew something was wrong, but we both focused on the task at hand. We arrived on the doorstep of a rectangular brick house on the outskirts of our town. The lawn unruly as old swings and trampolines gathered rust while paint chipped off in flakes off a shoddy picket fence. We knocked on the door as Jesse peered from an adjacent window before greeting us, a Victorian Bitter in hand.

Jesse never finished high school from what I could tell. Instead, he choose to live at his grandfathers house after inheriting it. He usually sported fluoro orange shirts as he worked constantly, that or he just could not be bothered taking them off. When he wasn’t concreting or brick laying, he would drive out into the highlands and cart wood to sell on the side. As such, his house was what I can confidently describe as stereotypically Australian, beer in the fridge, tools in the backyard and on the kitchen counter, topped off with a drumkit in the living room that was covered in a mess of cords and clothes.

“Yo Lachie, how’s it going mate.” Jesse mumbled, his curly, dirty blond mullet draped over his shoulders.

“S’all good mate, just checking on Bailey, how’s he going?” Lachie mimicked, despite how low I was feeling, it was nice to hear him butcher a bogan accent.

“Fuckin’ not good, he’s got all these meetings and that cause of what he did yeah-“ he leaned in close; his mumble dropped to a rather loud whisper.

“He was acting real weird before he took off that night.” He gestured for us to come in, eyeing me up and down as I found the cleanest spot in the living room to sit at, as clutter covered every surface.

“I don’t think I’ve met ya before?” he asked.

“Just Claire is fine-“

“Claire\~ cool name, I dig it. You want a beer? I got plenty in the fridge.” He motioned over to kitchen illuminated in a warm hue.

“I’m good thanks, can I ask where the bathroom is though?”

He looked up and gave a warm, yellow stained smile as he pointed to a dimly lit hallway.

“Yeah sure, it’s down there, knock yourself out-“ he said, before starting to converse with Lachlan. I tiptoed down, avoiding the trash on the floor as I peered into each room. I noticed Bailey’s red flannel in one of them and entered quietly. The room before me was a mess of dirty clothes, old video games and high-school memorabilia. I quickly and quietly made my way to his bed to look under his pillows for the artefact. When I could not find it there, I took to silently opening his desk drawers and closet to search for it. Despite the mess, the room seemed somewhat barren in a sense. In the end, I could not find it nor the notes that Lachlan had mentioned before. I walk back and shake my head at Lachlan as he continued listening to Jesse.

“-and then I chased ‘em off and out of the house, the short little fuck. That’s probably my first time dealing with a thief that managed to get inside the house.” He spoke with his hands as beer dripped onto the stained carpet. Lachlan signalled me to come sit next to him.

“Oh, do you mind repeating that story to Claire here?” Lachlan asked to which Jesse shrugged and lean forward.

“ I was almost robbed recently. Can you believe it? Someone trying to steal from this shithole? I think it was just a kid though, probably one of the Gretchan’s from down the street.” He took a swig from his bottle before continuing.

“Anyways, it’s just one weird thing after another, Bails was acting strange, talking to himself, drawing symbols, shit like that. Then, the night before he broke into the school, he blew up at me, me! I told him not only do I pay for half the rent, but I have shouted him for God knows how long, and *this* was how he was going to repay me? I told him to fuck off and haven’t really seen him since.”

“Fair dinkum” Lachie blurted, I gave him a look that I hope said ‘*no one says that’* before Jesse resumed.

“After that, I didn’t really see him, so I just assumed he was ignoring me. Good thing too! I didn’t feel like seeing him again after that, unless he brought me a slab of true blue dry, then I wouldn’t forgive him!”  

He kept going until Lachlan mentioned how late it was getting; we thanked him before walking out into the dark. The night sky shining of long dead stars above as I dialled Steph to call her, only to be greeted by silence followed by the tone.

“Hey Steph, sorry for staying out longer than I’d hoped. I’ll be back soon, just leave the apartment unlocked and we can talk things over once I’m back. I love you…” Lachlan kept his eyes on the road, but I felt him look over to me a couple of times while my attention was elsewhere.

“Is everything alright between you two?” he asked.

“It’s fine, just… a little rocky from everything, final exam stress, Stephen, all that.” I replied. He was quiet for a while as we went around the corner to my apartment. He dropped me off and I walked up the stairs to my apartment, each step leaving a sinking feeling in my stomach before I gently opened the front door.

“Steph? are you awake?”

I slinked through the kitchen, making my best to not make any noise. Only for the lights to turn on, as Steph came around the corner.

“Claire, why did you take so long?” she said coldly.

“Steph, I know I’m late, but I promise it was for a good reason-“

She stood there with her arms crossed, looking at me as I continued.

“Lachie mentioned that Bailey found something similar to us-“

“What?” she exclaimed loudly.

“Yeah, he mentioned he wasn’t doing well, getting irritable, agitated and that. Had notes everywhere and that artefact under his pillow. But when I went over to his house, nothing was there…”

We both stood there quietly, I waited for her to reply, but she never did. She simply looked away before I resumed.

“Steph… something bigger is going on. What if everything that’s been happening is connected? What if they-“  
“Claire-“ she interjected.

“Why didn’t you tell me? I could’ve helped you. You just left and- and I wasn’t sure if I would see you again. I had this awful, sinking feeling in my gut since Stephen disappeared, and it just gets worse and worse as the week has gone on.” I could see that she started to tear up, but she did her best to hide it from me.

“It’s late, Claire. I’ve been waiting for you for hours, and I didn’t hear from you. With everything going on, I worry- I worry about you so fucking much. Stephen just disappeared without a trace, what if that was you?” She reminded me of mum in that instant. I winced.

“Steph, c’mon don’t talk like that… Look, do you want to walk it off, go by the rockpools?”

We made eye contact for a second before she looked away.

“We might find another octopus this time.”

She sighed in defeat as we left together. We walked down a couple streets until coming unto the dark shore, illuminated faintly by the moon as its light flickered off the rippling waves. Though we talked little to each other, I could see her mood shifting as we pointed out some of the various species along the shore, primarily algal and sponge species that had washed ashore. We may have kicked the sponge between the two of us as we enjoyed the brisk sea air. We enjoyed our time on the shore until we came upon a foul odour, one that pierced the night and stopped us dead in our tracks. For me, it was the familiarity that made me sick to my stomach.

“Jesus- what is that, it smells awful.” Steph gagged.

I remember seeing the sea mist thickening on the quiet waves. I would stay with Steph, hand in hand as we stayed close to one another. The dull greys of the fog slowly snuffing the colours on the beach as we walked closer to the source.

“Hey Claire?” I could feel her grip tighten around my hand as our pace slowed, her hand felt cold and clammy as she shivered  in my grasp.

“Yeah Steph?”

“Who is that up there?”

I looked ahead; the faint silhouette of a person stood ominously in the sand. Standing still and facing away, seemingly transfixed by something on the horizon. As we approached, striking Auburn hair pierced the fog and we both immediately recognised and called out to her.

“Sally…?”

She turned around quickly; her eyes were wide and fearful. She did not attempt at a response before backing away from us into the mist.

“Stay back! Get away from me!” she stuttered, form the vague threat echoed a sorrowful burden.

“Oh, it’s just you…” she uttered. My heart raced, our arms raised and palms facing her as we backed away. Her figure blended into the fog, the breath of the sea enveloping her until she was but a phantom in the mist. She clutched her head with her hands and kneeling down, before a guttural scream of pain erupted from her that stunned us both.

“I saw her, up on the mountain that day, she had his bag! She had his things! She knew, she always fucking knew!” Sally screamed, her voice piercing the night as the mist seemed to thicken even more around us. We could hear her faintly sob before she continued.

“It spoke to me! Go away and don’t fucking listen to it! It used his voice! It used his voice and I can’t, I just-“

“The fuck?! Sally, are you-“ I uttered. Steph got closer, from my view she disappeared into the mist, while reaching out a hand for her, I could hear Sally slap it away and stumble backwards.

“I said go away!” 

As soon as she got up, she ran away with speed I have never seen anyone until that point. The interaction lingered minutes afterwards, as shock shackled us to the sand. The mist enveloped us as the cool whisps blew by; the crashing of the waves hushed in an unsettling fashion.

“Claire, I want to go home…”

 I agreed silently, but as we turned to the reserve to leave, we heard the faintest whisper from the shore. We spun around quickly, looking for the source of the sound. But we didn’t see anything, the mist was too thick and the dark suffocating our vision.

“What was that?”

 “I don’t know, but…” Steph twiddled her thumbs anxiously, before dry heaving audibly. The smell which had drawn us near was potent here. Piercing the faint waft of sea spray and sun-dried kelp was a fishy, sickly-sweet stench. A pungent odour that penetrated our senses. We could both tell that we were close to the source of the smell, as its strength became sickeningly staggering. Steph would gag into her hand as we walked closer, the smell reminded me of the sun burnt roadkill along the highway. Further up ahead, just past where Sally was standing, was a dark, thick carcass. The sand was stained black underneath as a viscous ooze seeped from a gigantic, gelatinous corpse. It was comparable in size to a whale calf, though it formed an almost unrecognisable pile of tissue. There was little flesh left, just dark, foul-smelling ooze, unidentifiable bone and the remnants of large, chitinous shells.

The strong stench made us step back. But just as we were about to leave, bubbling from the puddle, we could hear it again. It was clearer, the tone caused the hairs on my neck to stand on end. We both stood in shock, our vision tunnelling and focusing into the dark slick. The waves starting to rage with thunderous lament, the tide rising to meet us where we stood. The voice echoed in my mind, but I could not understand the whispers. Its wordless will worming its way deep as it drowned out our thoughts.

We started running then, sprinting as fast as we could, jumping over bits of driftwood. Occasionally tripping on rocks as we looked behind us, only to see nothing there. The whispers grew fainter the further we ran. Eventually we had covered enough distance that the sea mist had parted, panting heavily as we leaned against a tree.

“What… What was that?!” I sputtered breathlessly. Drenched in sweat as we made it to the safety of the road illuminated under the streetlamps.

“I don’t know… But… it sounded like...”

“Stephen…?” I replied. I did not want to believe it, as it may have just been a shared hallucination. But, it sounded so real, so close. Steph appeared in denial, as she could only muster…

“What?”

“The voice, can you remember it?” I repeated.

“The hell do you mean ‘can I remember it?’ Claire? I don’t even know what the fuck it was!”

She stood there as the mood soured. I tried to collect and compose myself, but my mind felt like it was scattered over the sand. As soon as I tried to describe it, I instantly got a headache. Of course we heard something, why else would we run away? Sally probably heard it too, but we could not put into words what it sounded like. It felt like a dream, but one that I could not wake from. I felt distant from everything.

“I’m sorry Claire. I-I snapped and I shouldn’t of.” She mumbled lowly. We kept walking together until we found a clean bench to sit at, as we sat and contemplated, combing through the events that just transpired. She sat there as sweat dripped from her brow.

“It’s going to sound strange, but I could almost hear my dad. Like, I heard Stephen sure, but I heard him as well and- and others as well. You heard it too, yeah?” I said softly.

She sat there and looked at me. After a minute of silence, she spoke quietly.

“No…” I shifted uncomfortably as the words came out of her mouth. I inched further into the trees, away from the water which seemed to follow us up the beach. While Steph remained at the tree, looking out to the sea. We were ill-prepared for what would wash upon our shores after that night. While everything before could just be chalked up to an improbable array of coincidences, the things that found themselves upon our shores only solidified our theories, and our fears.",1,1766285221.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Mario Fonseca is a passionate first-generation coffee producer dedicated to quality and sustainability. He focuses on cultivating exceptional Pacamara and Geisha coffees, employing careful attention to detail, minimal chemical use, and biological farming methods. His dedication has made Mil Cumbres a recognized name in Panama’s specialty coffee scene, earning accolades for both flavour and craftsmanship.

About the Farm

Mil Cumbres, meaning “a thousand hills,” is located in the Cloud Valley near Volcán, Chiriquí, Panama, at 1,600–2,000m. The farm spans approximately 60 hectares, with 25 hectares under coffee cultivation and the remainder preserved as native jungle within Barú Volcano National Park. Its high-altitude, volcanic soils, and unique microclimates create ideal conditions for growing complex, flavourful coffees with excellent clarity and body.

• Grind Size: Medium-coarse - 600 µm

• Water Temperature: 94°C

• Brew Time: 2 minutes 30 seconds

\*\*From the same or similar bean from Rosso Coffee Roasters:\*\* This decadent natural-process Pacamara from the Mil Cumbres farm in Chiriquí, Panama, offers a bold and indulgent profile. By drying the whole cherries under controlled conditions, the natural process concentrates the sugars to highlight the variety's characteristic depth. The result is a full-bodied cup with a plush, velvety mouthfeel, featuring rich notes of dried fig and dark cherry layered with heavy molasses sweetness and a unique root beer finish",1,1766285125.0,TanatAdventCalendar25,0,1.0,False
1prvou4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1prvou4,Serbia in June 2025 (Belgrade),"Spent some time solo in Serbia (Belgrade) back in June and ended up having a super great trip. Serbia is the most bizarre, yet beautiful country I've been to! You definitely experience a clash if you are from the West.

• I stayed in Belgrade for five days. The churches are amongst the most incredible I've ever seen in my life. The coffee and books culture is incredibly strong. People are friendly, proud and serious. The evenings downtown are amazing and extremely crowded. The locals seem to enjoy the daily life a lot more than we do in the West.
• Serbia is not too expensive! For the most part, you can stay on a relatively low budget, but still more expensive than most Eastern European countries.
• Belgrade is incredibly safe. As a solo traveller I didn't feel unsafe once. 
• May/June is an incredible time to visit! Not too crowded and enjoyable weather.

Please let me know if you have ever been, and don't hesitate if you have any questions!",1,1766285040.0,travel,1,0.67,False

1prvo21,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnionSlush/comments/1prvo21/my_own_union_screwed_me_so_i_started_union_slush/,"My own Union Screwed me, so I Started Union Slush","After witnessing multiple vicious attacks by our own nursing union, I created r/UnionSlush after RNPA leadership targeted me after I disclosed corruption and misconduct within the organization in good faith. I was forced to file a formal complaint with the PERB to defend my own labor rights and to protect other members when RNPA's behavior changed from petty to unlawful.

My experience created a lot of clarity. I learned that I was not the only one who had been ostracized and retaliated against. I was not alone. Not even close. There are many, many unhappy members. The very Union entrusted with listening to our voices was more interested in silencing. Loyalty was twisted into control, and transparency was treated like an act of rebellion. I learned why so many nurses before me have said, ""The Union is in bed with management"". 

And if that wasn’t clear enough—the **RNPA Vice President is a County manager.** 

Our member dues are supposed to fund representation, protection, and advocacy—not unmonitored spending and self-preservation. There’s been a consistent lack of financial disclosure, and members are left wondering where our money goes while our own concerns are ignored and we receive perfunctory Union representation, if any. These dues are *our* contributions, not anyone’s personal slush fund.

This space isn’t anti-union. It’s pro-member. It’s for everyone who still believes in what unions *should* stand for—fairness, ethics, and solidarity that runs both ways.

RNPA began holding its membership meetings on Zoom—but the chat and member-to-member messaging features have been disabled by RNPA. Think about that. In a union built on solidarity, we’re now prevented from even talking to one another. We can’t ask questions, share concerns, or connect without leadership controlling the flow of communication. That’s not transparency—that’s containment.

r/UnionSlush exists because members deserve a place to speak freely, compare notes, and hold leadership accountable—without being muted, managed, or monitored.

1prvjrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1prvjrl/hr_the_healthiest_ive_ever_been/,[HR] The Healthiest I’ve Ever Been.,"“Hello, Mr. Davidson, how are we feeling today?” The Doctor asked, reading off a chart before sitting on a rolling stool.

Mr. Davidson smiled at the bald man. “I feel the healthiest I’ve ever been!”

“So, what are we seeing you for today?” The Doctor asked, making quick glances between Mr. Davidson and his chart.

“It started last Tuesday. I woke up and found my knees didn’t hurt anymore. It was like a miracle, I felt all shiny and new. But nothing else happened that Tuesday.” Mr.Davidson explained happily. “Then on Wednesday, my back stopped feeling.”

Mr. Davidson stopped talking. Forcing the Doctor to look up from his clipboard. “Stop feeling... what?” He looked distressed, eyes flicking between the clipboard and his patient.

“It stopped feeling sore, the pain was just gone like my knees the day before. I could breathe a bit easier, but I don’t remember ever having any issues breathing. I don’t smoke, and as a geologist, I’ve lived a decently active life. But suddenly I felt like a little kid again. I started to worry slightly at that point.”

The Doctor flipped through his two pages on his clipboard, searching for something. Only to shake his head, blowing air out of his nose. “And that’s why you decided to stop in today?”

“No, first I went to my family doctor on Thursday, a DR.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. He ran the standard test, and that’s when he told me the best news I’ve ever been told.”

**“You’re the healthiest you’ve ever been.”**

The Doctor shuffled uncomfortably on his stool. He cleared his throat, “Ahem, so why are you here today, Mr. Davidson?”

Mr. Davidson chuckled, as if it were embarrassing to say. “I slept weird on Friday, I’d left my arm dangling over the bed. When I woke up, it didn’t work right. My elbow had come undone. Like my bones were too heavy for my joints.”

“Could you still use your arm?” The Doctor asked, tapping his pen on his mustache.

Mr. Davidson responded chipper as ever. “Of course, I’m the healthiest I’ve ever been.” The Doctor cringed, looking away as Mr. Davidson demonstrated. “It was scary, but I had to go work my shift at the coffee shop.”

“You didn’t think to stay home?” The Doctor’s interjection was stiff with little true emotion in his interruption.

David took the interruption in stride. “I almost called an ambulance. But then I remembered what the Doctor had told me.”

**“YOU’RE THE HEALTHIEST YOU’VE EVER BEEN.”**

The Doctor’s face twinged at the phrase. This was the first time it had felt threatening. “What did you do after that?”

“I found an old sling from a shoulder surgery I went through last year.” David beamed at his own ingenuity. “Making coffee with one arm is rather hard. But I didn’t want to upset any of my regulars.”

The Doctor has to flip furiously through his clipboard. He looked like he had to think of something on the fly. “I thought you were a geologist? Why are you working at a Coffee shop?”

“That’s not what you asked yesterday, Doctor.” Mr. Davidson growled, forcing the Doctor to jump off the stool. The pages of the script he was reading from fluttered off his clipboard as it fell to the floor. His hands trembled as he swallowed a curse. “Mr. Davidson, I don’t know what you mean. This is the first time you’ve been in my office.” He spoke slowly and deliberately, trying to re-steer the conversation. “I’m just trying to get a better understanding of your condition.”

“Of course, I’ve been getting things jumbled up recently. I’m a hobbyist geologist, but it doesn’t pay all of my bills when I’m not doing work for the museum. So I work as a barista part time.” Mr. Davidson jumped on the track eagerly.

The Doctor scooped up the now empty clipboard and snatched up a few script pages. He clicked his pen and began writing for the first time. “Did anything else happen on Friday?”

“I lost a few teeth in a customer’s drink. I sneezed real hard after some cocoa dust got in my nose. Don’t worry, I remade the girl’s drink, wouldn’t want to upset a pretty girl.” Mr. Davidson chuckled to himself.

“Surely that hurt, David. Was there any blood?” The Doctor asked, suddenly more casual. At Mr.Davidson’s silence, he tried to walk it back. “May I call you David?”

**“David...David...david... DAVID. Am I David?”** David asked, sounding unsure.

The Doctor took a deep breath, and David mimicked the action. “Your name can be shortened to David. Yes, you are David.”

“I understand. Thank you, Doctor. That feels important.” David thanked him.

The Doctor felt himself break out in a cold sweat at IT’S tone. He had to clear his throat before speaking again. “I’m here to help. Now, about the sudden tooth loss.”

“Yes, but I didn’t mind after all-”

**“YOU'RE THE HEALTHIEST YOU’VE EVER BEEN.”**

“But my Boss sent me home after that. I guess he didn’t understand.” David chuckled again in the same upbeat optimism. The exact same chuckle played back like a recording. “With the rest of the day off, I followed my boss’s advice to see a Doctor.”

“But why if your-” The Doctor stopped himself from saying the phrase with great effort.

David nodded, “Yes, that’s what they kept whispering to me after all. I just needed to trust them to feel it.” He went silent, leading the Doctor to ask who they were. “I don’t know, they became me and I them.”

“What are they?” The Doctor narrowed his questions.

David asked the same question back, but not to the Doctor. Then something else answered their questions. **“DAVID IS THE HEALTHIEST HE’S EVER BEEN.”**

The Doctor became pale at the sudden emergence of this **“OTHER.”** His eyes searched the office for some helpful guidance. When he found none, the Doctor took a shaky breath. He had to wipe sweat from his forehead.

**“IS THE DOCTOR UNWELL?”** The Other asked him directly in the Doctor’s own head. It sounded wispy and everywhere at once. It sounded cruel yet caring, like it didn’t know which it was being. Something was standing behind the Doctor. He knew it was there. Felt the tingle down the base of his skull, like fingernails down his neck. The Doctor started hyperventilating as he saw claws curl around his neck.

“NO! No, I’m fine. I’d like David to continue telling me about his condition today.” The Doctor practically screamed at it as he drilled his eyes forward at David. The Other vanished, or was never there to begin with. He couldn’t tell anymore.

Cheerful David came back like someone had pulled the string on his back to get him talking. “My Family practice got me in almost immediately once I showed up at their window. They took so many more tests. I remember asking if I was still the healthiest I’ve ever been. Instead, he said something pretty particular then.”

David fell silent, waiting for another string pull. The Doctor was growing more hesitant to be the one to pull it. “What did they say to you, David?”

“That I wasn’t human anymore. They told me to wait at home for the rest of the results. But as I sat on my bed waiting for the results, my legs came undone. Just like my arm had done. My body felt so heavy I couldn’t sit upright anymore. So, instead, I lay on the floor. I couldn’t breathe, I remember crying-”

“GOD, HELP ME!-” David screamed, suddenly no longer the puppet for a moment.

“-Which was so strange, since I wasn’t a religious person-” Two separate Davids were now speaking and screaming parts of the same moment.

“-GOD, PLEASE MAKE IT STOP! I DON'T WANT TO DIE!-”

“She must have heard me because she took the pain away. She reminded me-” David stopped and let it explain.

**“YOU’RE THE HEALTHIEST YOU’VE EVER BEEN, DAVID.”**

“-And of course She was right, She was the reason **I was the Healthiest I’ve ever been.**” David scratched his empty eye socket, flicking a bit of lingering flesh off his claw casually. The black speck hit the glass between them. The Doctor’s mouth hung open as David paused at the sudden appearance of a barrier between them. David jumped off the bed and pressed his black, dripping hands on the glass. Seeing his hands caught him off guard. The flesh was charred and flaking, black blood oozed out, but never off of him. It merely ran back inside another hole in his arms. Blue crystal like bones peeked out where the flesh sagged, hanging ragged off his forearms. His finger bones pierced the skin. A flex of his hands shredded what flesh remained as vicious, curved claws ticked against the glass. Crystal bones grew like bone spurs, leaving tree-like growth rings as new bones grew on old ones.

David pressed his face closer to the glass. His breath steamed the previously invisible barrier between himself and the Doctor. He stared at his own reflection. His human face hung on his chest like sliced meat, where it had been displaced by the clear reptilian blue crystal snout that had grown on his white skull like a mask. The old skin around the corners of his eyes traced what was left of his upper jaw and down the back of his neck. His back molars were exposed without lips to cover the crystal growth that extended his jaw into his new snout. David touched the human teeth and traced a claw where they turned to jagged crystal fangs two teeth over. Finally, he stopped at the front canines meant to bite and tear. The lower jaw opened and closed like a broken machine. His breathing grew rapid until his chest swelled and he expelled thick, viscous sludge on the floor of his containment unit. He dug his claws through the human bone of his skull, tearing the white pieces away. David tore into his own throat, looking for his voice. Black splattered the glass as IT laughed.

“DAVID!” The Doctor shouted, standing near the glass. “David, are you still in there?” He banged a fist on the glass, trying to draw his attention. David roared, deep guttural, not a trace of sound a human throat could produce. The black ooze filled the holes he’d torn in his own head. Ossifying rapidly into more blue crystal. But David stopped tearing at himself. He took lumbering steps back towards the glass. The Doctor stepped away, scared, as David leaned back on the clear barrier. He fogged the glass once again, his hand took the dangling face on his chest and folded it back till it flopped on his snout. David’s face no longer fit on his head. The Doctor called his name again, and David ripped the human face from his body. He shoved the former face down his own snout, dissolving it into more black ooze the second it touched his mouth. Through the gaping hole in his chest behind a crystal rib cage. The Doctor watched it flow back into his body.

David pressed his snout into the glass, staring at the Doctor for a long moment. His shoulders heaved up and down. The glass fogged rapidly as he panted on it. The Doctor approached the containment slowly, hand extended. David didn’t move, only breathed faster, the closer the man got. The Doctor did not touch the glass. He slammed his palm into a button. David couldn’t see from his side of the glass. An alarm sounded as amber lights started to spin within David’s room. He flinched away from them, trying to cover his head from the piercing sound. David punched the glass, threatened, scared of what was going on. His claws screeched as they scratched glass between them. David suddenly stopped acting scared as he looked up at the little flames that started to burn on the ceiling above him.

As if understanding what was about to happen, David stalked over to the metal table. He sat on it, folding his claws in his lap and staring at the Doctor on the other side. “See you tomorrow, Dr. Morris.”

\~

Dr. Morris felt a cold sickness in his stomach as the flames washed over the thing sitting on the repurposed morgue table. The thing known as David disappeared behind the curtain of chemical flames. He’d heard the voice clear as day within his own head. It knew his name now, and he’d taught it to understand what names meant. The creature didn’t scream or struggle as the flames cleaned the unit. Morris didn’t take his eyes off the glass until the flames stopped. Improbably, the only thing left in the containment unit was the crystal skull. Completely untouched by the flames, not even clouded by the smoke. It stared directly at him with its empty sockets. Simply waiting for tomorrow, it now has a concept of. The Doctor stumbled away from the button, sweating profusely. Armed soldiers poured into the mock doctor’s office.

“What happened, Doctor? It wasn’t time yet.” The man in front searched the room with his eyes behind his gas mask. He gripped his rifle as he stared at the skull in the chamber.

Dr. Morris wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, “I messed up, I had to go off-script. It... HE became aggressive, I had to restart the cycle.”

“What did it learn?” The soldier asked, only taking quick glances towards the doctor. Afraid to look at the skull for more than a moment.

The Doctor looked at the floor, exhausted. “It learned how to shorten its name, and about tomorrow and Yesterday.” He hid the fact that he now knew his name, somehow. The fact that he heard it in his head. Dr. Morris kept that to himself, scared.

“And the fucking glass, if it remembers that this whole thing is useless.” Another stepped forward, poking the long scratch with the barrel of his gun. He had a slight twang to his voice. “Thing scratched the Polycarbonate, Goddamn. How’d it manage that?”

The first soldier turned his back to the glass, an act of bravado. An act to show he was in charge and not afraid of the thing. His head kept trying to look back at the skull regardless. “We don’t know if it has that much object permanence,yet.” The “yet” was thrown in almost involuntarily at the end. He had to swallow before continuing. “We’ll try the script again tomorrow. If it doesn’t work, we’ll burn it, refuel, and try a new routine.” The soldier focused completely on Dr. Morris. “How do you feel, Doctor?”

Dr.Morris took a deep breath. “I’m fine, **I FEEL HEALTHIER THAN I’VE EVER BEEN.”** Morris froze, mouth gasping at the words that had tumbled out. Why’d he say that? Oh God, why had he said those-

The bullet entered the back of his head, cutting the thought short. Dr. Morris dropped face down on the floor. Everyone stood painfully still, staring at the dead doctor. There wasn’t an exit hole from the rifle round. Black blood oozed out the back of his skull, congealed like sludge. Every soldier jumped away from the body.

“Get him in the burner, NOW!” The first soldier screamed in panic. Two other people quickly grabbed the dead doctor under his armpits and dragged him through the airlock into the containment unit. He hit the button as soon as his people were clear. The flames left nothing but charred bones. Clear crystals had begun to grow between the joints. The Doctor’s skull had a large patch growing right on the ridge of his skull. A bullet could be seen, stopped on the inside of the skull.

No one spoke as they left the room and silently went to decontamination. But David watched till the lights switched off.

My husband's family had their Christmas party today. I knew it wouldn't be good, but I tried to be hopeful that it wouldn't be THAT bad.

 It was at his cousin's house so there were a few people there that I didn't really know that well, but even the ones that I did know had me on high alert. My daughter(3) is extremely allergic to dairy and peanuts and my son (9 months) who knows.

 Everyone was eating pizza and subs when we arrived, without a care in the world. Not washing hands, leaving their plates on the coffee table unattended. I'm watching my kid like a hawk, feeling eyes on me. I know the way people think, oh just let them play and explore. I WOULD LOVE TO. People don't understand that me watching them, following them can be the difference between life and death, between going home to actually have a nice night and ending up in the hospital. 

All the other kids were running around eating Reese's, throwing their wrappers all over. I told my husband to please make sure everyone is aware and remind them to be careful. Apparently, that's too much to ask for.

I'm not really one to police what people do in their own homes, plus they're not my family. I would have preferred to skip it entirely. I'm just so tired of never being able to relax even a little when out with my children. I know it's my job, but there's only so much I can do when other people are throwing peanut butter cup wrappers and touching their little cheeks with hands that could be contaminated before I can react.

On the way home my daughter threw up all over herself. I don't know if it was from the car ride, or an allergic reaction. I kept her close and kept an eye on her for a while, but she typically doesn't throw up like that.

I'm just so tired. I want my kids to have a semi normal life.",15,1766284541.0,FoodAllergies,6,1.0,False
1prvi52,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1prvi52/has_anybody_done_iv_antibiotics_for_aerobic/,Has anybody done iv antibiotics for aerobic vaginal bacteria?,"

This is kinda a rant and also cause im feeling a bit lost on what to do. 
Idk what to do anymore. 

I never had issues like this till this one partner I had and my lack of education, I was dealing with Ureaplasma before all of this. And UTIs so I’ve being dealing with a lot of symptoms and they kind of overlap. Also done antibiotics like doxycycline because of Ureaplasma. 


Fast forward, Ureaplasma parvum is “gone” but E. coli has remained and now e facelis. 
I’m currently taking hiprex and phenazopyridine. 


August I had cleared E. coli back to back. First,  had ecoli and proteus miribalis- treated with levofloxican. 

But then E. coli remained and was treated with macrobid. 
I kept getting symptoms, mainly urinary symptoms. They slowly got worst, so I kept testing multiple times at different doctors and always had inconclusive results on my urine. Like “mixed flora” “ less than 10K CFU” etc…. I believe this is because of the labs thresholds. My bacteria doesn’t reach 100k CFU for a “true infection”. 

Finally went to my gyn and PCP SAME DAY for a urine culture again and it showed E. coli, with e facelis at the gyn test results but pcp was only e facelis showed up…. 
As you can see E. coli plays peek a boo and it honestly drives me crazy. Cause we’re did it go if I haven’t treated it and have symptoms. 
They both gave me macrobid. Which I haven’t taken any because I don’t think it’ll work… I’ll explain further 

My shocker was when i opened my results and seen, THE SAME exact resistant/sensitive patterns as August’s ecoli strain….? even thought I clicked the wrong test but no! 

So I went to a urogyn and finally confirmed my theory. She did a “vaginal aerobic swab”and showed the same E. coli strain as August. It never left. My vagina was a reservoir for this strain of esbl E. coli. So macrobid worked for my bladder but my vagina wasn’t touched. 

I’m not prone to UTIs. All this mess started with Ureaplasma and this persistent E. coli.

Now where I’m lost…. 

The E. coli 25-50k CFU,  I have is only sensitive to IV antibiotics. 

When you compare the results. My vaginal swab only shows sensitivity to IV antibiotics like meropenem. All penem antibiotics, I can do. 
My urine tests shows the same but only oral antibiotics is macrobid. 
All the doctors, including the ER, that I’ve going to tell me to take macrobid and hiprex to avoid the infection despite the bacteria still growing. 

But what about my vagina? I feel that it’s the initial problem that going to keep having me back at square one. 

I thought getting meropenem would be the solution and finally got my urogyn to write me a script, but chapgpt says that it doesn’t penetrate vaginal tissues, and it only works on active infection, not “ colonization”

So am I just suppose to let it grow for the infection to flare? I’m scared of sepsis….. 

Urinalysis shows everything clear but I’m having symptoms 

My good bacteria is low asf. I know I have AV. Aerobic vaginitis 
My vagina hurts and it’s dry, my clitoris hurts so much i sometimes limp as i walk. I have back pain and side pain that comes and goes. I feel so disgusting :( and frustrated, I feel tired like I’m running out of strength sometimes. I’m upset, I can’t have sex because I mentally think I’m making everything worst. This has taken a toll on me so heavily. I feel that I need to throw a tantrum on the floor so doctors would take me serious, I don’t see the preventative health care no where. Literally had a doctor tell me I just want the easy way out and I’m just upset because it’s easier than putting in the work……

Idk what else I’m NOT doing. 
Lactic acid suppository has helped, probiotic yogurt, boric acid, no sugars, no underwear at night, cotton underwear only, I’m not even having sex…. No crazy soaps down there, no caffeine ( my bladder hurts and I don’t even like coffee or soda) I change underwear throughout the day so I don’t have the same panties all day….. all since August. I truly think E. coli and the pathogens just aren’t letting my vagina do her thing 

If I put my good bacteria up, it’s going to help with the symptoms, but I still have this pathogen inside of me that I would like to get rid of. Get rid of it means I need to go on antibiotic that will still wipe off my good bacteria even more. And I’m just so upset because every time I’m so close to the solution it’s a problem. 

I thought IV antibiotics will fix my problem, so I could at least get a clean floor, but now I see that it probably won’t penetrate my vagina….. according to ChatGPT, due to the mucosa , so do I just have to deal with it for life? ",1,1766284454.0,WomensHealth,0,1.0,False

 Was cold as hell out there, woke up with frost all over everything and got woken up a few times by passing freight trains but I actually slept pretty well despite that. Woke up this morning just before the sun came up and started up walking again after I packed up everything. 

On my way out of town this older couple invited me onto their porch for some breakfast and coffee so I was chatting with them for a bit before moving on. They tried giving me some canned food and stuff but I'm pretty full up on food in my pack so I had to decline but they did fill up my water jug and give me a cigarette.

 Ended up getting picked up by this fella who was nice enough to drive me across the border a little ways into Alabama by an onramp. Tried thumbing it for a while but there was very little traffic right there so eventually had to keep trying route 11. 

It's a good thing I did because not 10 minutes later I was able to get a ride to a gas station a few exits down the 59 and got picked up there pretty quick. Unfortunately when I got in I misheard them, thought they said they were going 50 minutes down the road but it was 15. But got 5 bucks and a meal out of it at least.

Joshua, 12. He was killed by a crazy homeless guy while getting groceries for the older orphans. Joshua possessed the Mimic, later also possessing his rabbit suit, Vincent, at William's request.
Beatrice, 6. She was killed by vengeful spirits after she poisoned the orphanages' food, killing them all, because of Joshua's death. She possessed Eleanor afterwards, then also possessing her rabbit suit, Vickie.
Sebastian, 6. He died in the house fire that made the other 2 be orphans. He had a nightmare, so asked his parents to sleep in their room. He is Joshua's twin, and died when Trixie was a baby. He then possessed Beatrice for a while, until she died, then possessed Eleanor with her (he was a dormant soul though. He also possesses his rabbit suit, Victor.

Then there are those 3's parents and their adopted kids (left 2 right):
Margaret, 43. She was the 3rd owner of the company, and she made the Mimic, and Eleanor, to be assistants for the family, but they managed to escape the fire that killed Margaret, Sebastian, and Percy. She possessed the plush she made in memory of her dad that she forgot to name, called 'White Tiger'.
Theodore, 8. He was kidnapped by a crazy guy (not William lol), and he was experimented on, with remnant, to try curing the guy's sick daughter. When the sick girl died, the kidnapper 'euthanized' Dori. He possesses a stuffed elephant named Ring Leader. 
Esmeralda, 8. She grew sick, and nothing seemed to help. One day she found out where her dad had Dori hidden. She couldn't help him though, since her dad caught her. She did give Dori the stuffed elephant before being caught though. She then stopped fighting, in hopes that he would live if she died. She possessed her favorite stuffie, a lamb named Wool.
Percival, 45. He was a writer, working from home, and did most of the childcare (with Mimic and Eleanor). He met Maggie at a coffee shop, and they eventually started dating! When he died in the fire, he ended up possessing a plush that Margaret made in memory of his mom, with the ""filler"" name, 'Bengal Tiger'.

1prv7qx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1prv7qx,Quick Review of Two Coffees - PMDG 737,"So... I will shamefully admit that I paid the upgrade fee for the PMDG 737 for FS2024.  I wanted to free my drive of FS2020 and it was pretty much the only airframe holding me back.  I saw the controversy around this release while sitting on the toilet in some hotel room during a layover in Japan, but I had nevertheless bit the bullet, purchased the bird, and thought I'd do a quick review to see if the steep $30 USD upgrade was worth it.  Its a steep price tag, so I fully understand the controversy.

  
As a bit of background, I currently fly the 737 (NG & MAX) as my day job since leaving an old toxic legacy carrier behind.  I do genuinely enjoy the 737 despite fancier alternatives out there, and have several thousand hours on the real crate, so hopefully I can make this sound like I know what I am talking about.  Today, I started the aircraft cold & dark at Salzburg Airport (LOWS)... a place I never been to, but looks pretty darn beautiful.  My plan is to takeoff runway 33, go straight into the RNP Y for 33, do a missed approach, come back for ILS Z 15, and transition to a couple touch and goes.

  
**Preflight**

I tried using FS2024's walkaround mode before even powering up the aircraft.  I used the default TUI livery, which seemed semi-appropriate (even though I don't fly for them).  The exterior appeared mostly ok.  I popped myself into the nose wheel well and saw the two steering cables as expected, which was nice.  It seems to be missing the lever that bypasses the steering and where the bypass pin is supposed to go though.  On the right side of the fuselage, the green disc for the crew oxygen is still there, which is good.  The engines at a glance appears okay and the latches are below the cowl as expected.  I looked up into the wheel well and its much better modelled than in FS2020 (which wasnt really all that modelled at all).  However, there are missing textures in the wheel well, and I can readily see that the APU fire handle and the NGS indications isn't even colored.  Ah well.  Rest of the exterior seemed okay.  There are click spots to open the cargo door, but for some reason they would not open without power to the aircraft (probably an FS2024 limitation, as I recall having some weird issue with doors on the Fenix as well when its not powered).

  
Jumping inside the aircraft, I had a quick look at the new cabin.  I cannot open the lavatory doors, and I get a sound saying they are occupied!  On top of that, the placarding to indicate the whether the lavatory is occupied is not there.  The attendant control panel is clickable, but there are a few missing functions that seem WIP.  The cabin looks nice and the overhead bins can be opened/closed.  The window shades can also be clicked open/closed.  

  
Going into the cockpit, the switch for the door can be clicked now.  The access keypad is also clickable, though it didn't do anything functional (somewhat expected).  There are some memo notices attached to the wall, and I found one from Weyland-Yutani reminding me to ensure the integrity of the xenomorph I carry onboard.  The EFB and indeed the FMC retains a lot of the legacy functionality of the FS2020 version where you can set the ZFW and fuel via the FMC, but you can also optionally use the EFB to do some of that as well.  Anyways, I loaded 11 tonnes of fuel, 49.0 tonnes of ZFW, and began setting up the aircraft.  I powered up the aircraft, and did my preliminary preflight procedure.  One problem I noticed was that the stall warning test certainly didn't sound the stick shaker as I expected.  It made this weird thump sound and sounded nothing like the stick shaker should sound. 

I went into the FMC and noticed that my nav data was not to date.  Luckily, I can update on the fly using the EFB, which was nice as I didn't really feel like reloading the aircraft.  I programmed the FMC as I normally would.  I was very pleasantly surprised that the FMC now finally has a RTE 2 function!  This was sorely missing in the FS2020 version, and my understanding was that the FMC was modelled on an outdated software version (probably U10.7).  The rest of the preflight went smoothly.  I did a lights check of the whole panel and it seems all the lights minus the WHEEL WELL light (expected) illuminated.  I did notice that pressing recall on the System Annunciator Panel takes about a second for the annunciations to appear, whereas in the real aircraft, it pretty much pops up instantaneously.  While doing my scan of the cockpit, I noticed that the MIC switch on the dash was missing.  This is my go-to PTT switch for communicating to ATC, so I was surprised its not there.  I'm not sure if there is an option to get it to show, nor do I know if its a ""Boeing Option"", but it seems like a terrible omission to me.

  
**Engine Start and Taxi-Out**

I didn't really notice anything out of the ordinary for the engine start.  Much of it works as expected.  Everything from the initial fuel flow, the EGT parameters, and so on.  Once the engines started, I configured flap 5, and taxiied out to runway 33.  The ground handling I find is actually vast improved compared to the FS2020 version of the NG.  Has some nice rattles and sounds to it as well.

  
**Departure & RNP Approach**

The takeoff felt fairly realistic, and the flight director commanded around 15 degrees of pitch initially when I left the ground.  The FS2020 version used to momentarily command up to around 20 degrees of pitch before settling back down to maintain V2+20.  I didn't notice the problem here, and the commanded pitch and speeds appeared normal.  I cleaned the aircraft up on schedule, and then immediately transitioned to the RNP Y (AR) for runway 33.  I do not really know who is actually approved to fly the AR into this airport, but its a good approach to see how well the aircraft can actually fly an RNP approach. 

I went to the final fix, set minimums in the MCP, and began configuring the aircraft for the approach.  There is a really tight turn after the second last waypoint (WS836) that takes the aircraft onto final.  Surprisingly, this bird flies the approach no problem, and I noticed no significant cross track deviations that the aircraft ANP would bust RNP.  The FS2020 version of this 737 never flew this that well, and the iFly couldn't even get me anywhere near centerline.  So, I think there has been some improvements.

  
At minimums, I did a go-around.  Everything appeared normal and I cleaned up the aircraft on schedule to pick up the missed approach hold.  Aircraft seemed to enter the hold no problem.

  
**ILS Approach & Touch and Goes**

I reconfigured the aircraft for the ILS 15.  I left the autobrakes off and speedbrakes down as I was going to attempt a touch and go.  On the ILS, the aircraft performed much to the numbers.  At flap 30, with around 55% N1, it maintained a 3 degree glidepath at VREF+5 no problem.  I flared the aircraft at around 20 feet and touched down.  The touchdown felt a bit more solid than the FS2020 version, and I think it actually feels a bit more real.  I went to flap 15, stood the throttles, then went to about 85% N1 and took the aircraft back in the air.

Manually flying the aircraft into a left crosswind and downwind felt pretty bang on.  After around 800' AGL, I lowered the nose to 10 degrees, went flap 5, and set around 75% N1.  In the real aircraft, it should be pretty close to flap 5 maneuvering speed and it was in this case.  I leveled off at 3,000' or so, maintained 5 degrees nose up and 55% N1, and it maintained level and onspeed as expected.  Abeam the threshold, I took the time.  At 30 seconds, I dropped the gear and went flap 15.  At 45 seconds, I turned base, then did a repeat touch and go.  After that, I armed the speedbrake and autobrake, and made a final full stop landing.  

  
**My impressions** 

This is the only flight I've made in the PMDG 737 for FS2024 so far, so there are probably issues I haven't come across yet or omitted.  There are a few notable improvements in the visual model of the aircraft.  There are also a few missing textures here and there, and the missing mic switch on the dash annoys me a bit.  The stall warning test is an issue.  Oh, and the weather radar panel is set weird by default with the gains set in weird places.  However, I did think PMDG did some overhauling of the model based on what I encountered, and I would say that it has been an improvement with a few flaws here and there.

  
The manual handling feels excellent, and the autopilot flight director system seems to perform as I would expect.  The ground handling is much improved. 

  
Is it worth the $30 USD upgrade?  I think this is really subjective, and it really depends on how much disposable income you have.  I'd say a $15-20 range would probably be a bit more reasonable... but that is just me.  I think PMDG does need to respect their loyal customers a little more, but at the same time, I still find the aircraft quite good to fly, so there is that.  Just my opinion.

Anyways, just a quick review and hope it is helpful for some people.  Going to try and take the thing up for some V1 cuts and other failures tomorrow to see how I can break it.",32,1766283532.0,MicrosoftFlightSim,7,0.94,False

This is where operators talk real.

You're here because you know the truth that running a restaurant is not a game. It's a fight. Every day you manage money that isn't yours yet, people whose lives depend on your decisions, and food that spoils if you blink. The margins are thin. The hours are long. The work is honest.

This community exists for people who understand that.

We're not here to celebrate Instagram moments or pretend the job is romantic. We're here because the business demands it. Because you need to share what actually works, what failed, and why. Because the operator next to you has solved a problem you're still bleeding over. Because restaurants are where culture happens, where survival is measured in covers and cents, and where a single decision about scheduling or pricing ripples through a staff and a community.

**What happens here:**

Posts that matter. An owner who broke even for the first time, walking you through his P&L. A bar manager explaining why her labor model works when everyone said it couldn't. A sous chef's playbook for keeping standards when you're down two people. A general manager who lost a lease and lived to tell what she learned. These are the stories that move the needle.

Questions asked with teeth. Not ""How do I start a restaurant?"" (plenty of blogs for that). But ""I'm doing $800K a year, food costs are at 32%, and I can't get anyone to stay past ninety days—what am I missing?"" That's the conversation.

Data, not theory. You post numbers. You name your concept type, your location, what you've tried, where you failed. Context matters. Advice without it is just noise.

**The unspoken rules:**

Respect the grind. Everyone here has paid their dues in a hot kitchen or a packed dining room or a walk-in at 2 AM. Acknowledge that.

Be honest about what you don't know. The best operators are curious enough to admit weakness.

No gatekeeping. A person with three months and a genuine question deserves respect. So does the vet with twenty years.

No spam. No posting a link to your consulting firm or your POS software unless it's genuinely useful and you say so clearly. We'll know if you're here to sell instead of share.

**Introduce yourself:**

Tell us who you are.

* Your role. Owner, GM, chef, bar lead, ops, kitchen manager—whatever you are, we need to know your vantage point.
* Your concept. QSR, casual, fine dining, coffee, cocktail bar, food truck, multi-unit—the type shapes everything.
* Your current wound. What's the thing keeping you up? What did you learn the hard way?

This isn't a space to pretend. It's a space to be clear-eyed about the work, the stakes, and the people depending on you to get it right.

Welcome. You belong here because you chose to show up and do the work.

-two months of lupron for endometriosis suppression after complete excision surgery 2 months ago

-metformin and weight lifting for pcos

-anti inflammatory diet I've been 80% compliant with (gf, df)

-one coffee per day/2 daily very rarely but will cut back further as it get closer to fet

-trying to limit stress and get good sleep

-ovasitol (4g per day)

-methylfolate pnv with iron

-2000iu vit d

-seed probiotic

-natalcholine 

-vit e 200-400 iu at start of cycle

-fish oil

-baby aspirin at start of cycle 

-keeping feet warm around embryo transfer/after

-no cold water/drinks

-beet juice two weeks before fet

-laugh a lot day before transfer and after

-take it easy after transfer but no bed rest...just gentle walks etc



Note...I've heard sex day before transfer can be helpful but I'm afraid to for fear of the fet working and getting pregnant naturally as I have a bicornute uterus and can't handle multiples :/",2,1766283059.0,IVF,4,1.0,False

This will be a quick one, mostly because there's not much new but I wanted to share this because my posts are usually negative, so...

Last night was my company's Holiday Party. I usually don't like things like that because they send my social anxiety spiraling off the charts, but since I'm trying to be a good employee (see, I can learn some lessons) and widen my social circle, I went. Carrie stayed home with the kids as the party was at a hotel and not child friendly.

Before anyone asks: no I didn't meet someone there or have a meaningless hookup or cheat on my wife since she's probably cheating on me (so many msgs from people convinced Carrie is following in her sister's footsteps) or anything like that. I hung out with coworkers, had a nice meal, talked to colleagues from other departments, and did my best to not let my anxiety alter my behavior. It was fun and I surprised myself by actually enjoying it and I didn't seem to annoy anyone and as the evening wound down, I thought that was going to be that.

And then came the 'year end awards' part of the night. They're mostly not real awards. Think things like 'best dressed', 'most epic lunch order', 'best coffee maker', things like that given out with award certificates and joke prizes. But there's a few awards that are more serious. They usually focus on measurable metrics and there's a couple that are actually voted on by the entire staff, like the one called the ""Service Award"" which is given to the employee that has 'demonstrated the most dedication and willingness to be of service to other team members and is always there to help when needed'.

That's the award I won.

It's a glass paperweight for my desk (shaped like a star because apparently I'm the 'service superstar') and a gift certificate to a local restaurant which is cool and all but what actually meant something was the presentation itself. For every award there was a small slideshow (our social media guy can't resist any opportunity to create content) and mine included a slide with one of those word cloud things made up of comments people had submitted about me. 

I almost f'ing cried. (OK. I *did* cry, later. By myself and not in public.) All of the things I've been doing at this job because I didn't want it to end up like the last one AND because all that therapy I did helped me to realize were things I *wanted* to do because I'm good at them were the things that people mentioned. 

Some were obvious 'service' things like being called reliable and dependable and helpful. But someone said they only volunteered for projects I was on because they knew things would always get done. Someone else said they appreciated that I always focused on what was best for the project and the end goal, even if that meant following someone else's lead. 

My direct boss was the one who presented me with the award and they said they'd voted for me because I made their job easier. They knew that they didn't have to wonder about me. If they gave me positive feedback or constructive criticism or just told me no, there was never any doubt as to how I'd handle it. I'd show up. I'd do the work. I'd be whatever part of the team they needed me to be. 

The party ran late and by the time I got home, Carrie and the kids were already asleep. I spent the day with my daughter, watching old school Dora the Explorer in between very short trips outside to see the snow and I still haven't told Carrie about the award. I texted Ellie, who lost her damn mind and told me I should leave the paperweight right on the kitchen counter next to Carrie's coffee mug for her to find in the morning.

Ellie's pettier than I am 😂. 

Since I don't think I'll be posting much until after the holidays, I wanted to share this now while it was fresh. Maybe this way, if it gets stressful over the next couple weeks, I can reread this and that will help me remember that I've got evidence now that I can do something right. 

I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday and thank you all for listening to me, even when I'm a little slower to realize things than you'd like. I appreciate all the encouragement and all the messages (even the ones about Carrie cheating) and that I've got somewhere to share eveb a small win like this one.

COFFEE:  I really don’t care what some of you think but the coffee is awesome. If your coffee is burnt; it’s expired, ask them to remake it (they are obligated to do so) 
FOOD: I don’t eat there and ok maybe I can agree on the fact that the food isn’t great but remember it was originally a coffee shop. I get donuts and coffee from there and never have anything negative to say. 
COMPARISON: Whoever says McDonald’s coffee is better is lying, not only is it a copy of Tim’s, their machines rarely get cleaned so have fun drinking moldy coffee. (Cheers to saving 50 cents) or pay $10 for a coffee and Starbucks lol. 2.25 for a large coffee in the morning isn’t overpriced what so ever. Not to mention people talking about making it at home, I have multiple coffee makers and none compare to Tim’s coffee. Not counting my espresso machine which is pretty decent. 
CANADIAN WORKERS: I literally work at Tim’s and half the employees are Canadian born. Yes there are many temporary workers and international students but they are the ones that work Monday - Friday 8-5. Your high school son can’t do that….im in university, was born in Canada and I get as many shifts as I want when I’m around to work them. You people are delusional 

TL:DR Tim’s isn’t that bad you people just complain about anything. Coffee is great and not all employees are TFW. I bet if someone gave you $100 you’d say “what only $100 my neighbour gets $300. Either quit complaining or stop going it’s that simple ",0,1766282622.0,TimHortons,9,0.25,False

I’m severely allergic to pistachio. Touch it and I die kinda thing.

Now, we’re bringing in pistachio milk for everything, as well as pistachio lattes. the milk is highly concentrated with allergens. I thought about maybe wearing gloves, but when steaming milk it sprays up, etc. then I considered a mask and long sleeves but if I’m at the point where I have to wear a hazmat suit basically just to go to work is it even worth it?? Even with all that I still run the risk of a reaction somehow. I asked my boss if there was any way I could just be on register for the time being (the milk is seasonal) and she laughed and was like bro no? Just wear gloves, you’re not ingesting it.

I’m very sad because I LOVED my job and it pays well. It’s super hard to find jobs right now. I’m sort of panicked but I gotta figure this out b4 we bring it in so I can give my two weeks.

1pruux8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1pruux8/the_messy_chaotic_holiday_party/,The messy chaotic holiday party :),"The house smells like roasted vegetables, butter, and mild tension. I’ve been here all day because I live in town, which apparently means I’m the default helper, emotional support, and witness to everything. My mom’s been cooking since noon, moving around the kitchen like she’s on a mission, even though she keeps insisting she’s “fine.”

My dad shows up mid-afternoon with his girlfriend in tow. She’s energetic in a way that feels dangerous. She immediately asks if she can help cook, already reaching for a cutting board before my mom can answer. Mom pauses for half a second too long, then says yes, because saying no would somehow be worse.

My sister arrives last—fresh off a flight from Germany, married, exhausted, and running purely on airport coffee and vibes. She gives quick hugs, drops her bag by the door, and sinks into a chair like she might not stand up again. She’s quiet, jet-lagged, and observant, taking everything in without saying much.

I float between rooms, refilling drinks, translating passive-aggressive comments into something polite, pretending everything is normal. Dad’s girlfriend keeps offering help. Mom keeps saying she’s got it. Dad keeps hovering like he’s afraid to sit down.

No one brings up how weird this all is. We just keep moving, keep cooking, keep talking about flights and recipes and the weather—like the awkwardness won’t spill if we don’t look at it too hard.

A bit about each character- 

Mom
She’s the kind of person who shows love through doing. Cooking, cleaning, hosting—if her hands are busy, her feelings don’t have to be. The divorce hardened her a little, but mostly made her quieter about her hurt. She insists she’s fine, even when she’s clearly not, and takes pride in holding things together. Holidays matter to her, even when they hurt.

Dad
He’s trying—sometimes too hard. After the divorce, he leaned into being “easygoing,” using jokes and charm to smooth over discomfort. He hates conflict and avoids heavy conversations, even when they’re necessary. Bringing his girlfriend feels like proof that he’s moved on, though a part of him still feels awkward being back in this house.

Sister
Recently married and living overseas, she feels slightly out of sync with everyone now. The distance changed her; she’s calmer, more observant, and less interested in old family dynamics. Jet-lagged and quiet, she listens more than she speaks, choosing her words carefully when she does talk.

Dad’s Girlfriend
She genuinely wants to help. A fixer by nature, she fills silence with kindness, offers assistance as a peace offering, and tries hard to be liked without overstepping—though she sometimes does anyway. She’s aware she’s an outsider and compensates with enthusiasm, hoping effort can bridge history.

And there’s me- (I will be playing myself)

People think it's the only hint in the movie clip, BUT, I think the inclusion of that initial part in the video might be another hidden clue. A hint that Mike is going to be Vecna'd:

* Mike has been shown drinking quite a bit of coffee (which is kinda sus for a teenager in the 80s, so he may be having nightmares and difficulty sleeping at night), and Mike seemed somewhat spaced out when Nancy spoke to him at the hospital, which may be the shock from having both parents in hospital AND/OR a symptom from Vecna's stalking;
* Vecna mentioning Mike to Nancy in her vision;
* Several very SUS camera angles have focused on Mike since previous seasons.

All of this seems to indicate that he is being stalked by ""someone"" for quite some time (especially the sus camera angles from past seasons).   


Anyway, about the movie clip, just like the Byler hint, let's look into it like the woman is El and the man is Mike. The characters begin by talking about their future (nod to their sunset scene in Vol. 1 or perhaps a future scene like the bathtub one?). Then, they move on to THIS:

    Mike - ""Has he arrived yet?"" (This could be Mike asking himself OR talking about Will with El)
    
    El - ""Not Yet"" (Mike and Will didn't talk about their feelings and mutual pining yet)
    
    Mike - ""I shall hope he makes it snappy"" (Will gotta do something asap for Mike's sake, maybe because Mike in serious danger? Or even kidnapped?)
    
    Mike - ""My time is limited"" (Clock's ticking for Mike...)
    
    El - ""Yes, it is, isn't it?"" (Yeah, you're about to be Vecna'd)

This might be kind of a reach... but like Lucas, I don't believe in concidences anymore.

I don't know who is going to confess to each other. And maybe El and Mike won't have a scene with those dialogues or something similar... because this might just be a figure of speech to the audience, which is: those dialogues are just thoughts, they are only happening in Mike's head (considering we might finally get a Mike POV in Vol 2).

  
PS 1: I came up with this theory thanks to the clip from u/isakcardamon21 post (https://www.reddit.com/r/byler/comments/1prpagr/michael\_time\_is\_ticking/) and also reflecting deeply on why the clip doesn't start exactly at the Byler hint.

important notes: she's married. I worked there for a year before she came. neither of our jobs is above or below the other. we have different jobs and I love mine, don't want hers, there's only a small crossover. and most importantly I didn't get the opportunity to attend university because I was raised in a religion that is strictly against it and was threatened I would be disowned - she knew this.

I was friends with a coworker and while she sometimes wasn't nice to me I made excuses for her behavior.

one day we were in the kitchen (of our very echoey office) and she said the following;

\- I'm stealing opportunities from people who deserve it and I shouldn't be allowed to be part of our team.

\- I belong in the laboratory because it's the 'unskilled and uneducated'  position

\-im weak because I do what I'm asked and she would never let anyone tell her what to do.

and finished it off with - that I only want to be involved with the teamwork happening out the back because of my huge crush on (male coworker)

these comments made me question my place in the team or if these were the consensus of my team, back out of development opportunities because I was scared I was stepping on her toes by furthering my knowledge, deminishing my achievements so I didn't upset her. terrified me if the male coworker would hear about it from others who may have heard. yes this was brought to the manager at the time.

her behavior towards me continued over the next months. behavior that included;

power struggles on work I had taught her to do (and that I myself had written the instructions on how to do) that she felt I shouldn't be allowed to even touch. to keep the peace I would step back, stay quiet and cry later.

getting upset when I got my forklift license. I myself didn't tell anyone because I knew how she could react... manager announced it and she later told me 'bitchy people always get what they want'

not letting me help with things, even if manager told her to send me a piece of work to assist with she wouldn't.

ignoring me until other coworkers arrived then acting like we were best mates in front of manager, making me honestly question what I had done wrong all the way to did I just imagine the first 40 minutes of work where she ignored me talking to her.

Feb 14th Valentines day I made heart shaped cookies and placed them in our warehouse kitchen as it was going to be a looooong day. when she saw them she said 'you should have put crushes name on them' again out loud where anyone could have heard.

then the sample incident happened. I was asked by crush to prepare work, and I completed the task. all items were laid out on a benchtop in the lab waiting instructions on shipping. a few weeks later bully was tasked with shipping but had to add one composite sample. spoiler alert she ignored all my work and did everything herself and sent her work off.

when I spoke with management I said crush was probably busy and didn't tell her it was already done/maybe forgot. she may have not seen them (difficult given they were laid out on one of the only bench spaces clearly labeled) but suggested in future that all Lab workers be ccd on emails about lab work to prevent time wasting.

the next day at work bully leaned over (our desks were a meter apart) told me my wasted time didn't matter because I probably only did a small portion of the work and that I shouldn't have done the task. I told her I was asked and I do what I'm told to which she responded 'no YOU shouldn't have even been asked to do lab work.

this incident caused me to apply for WFH, I asked to move my desk, and told manager that this was causing me to lose sleep, get anxious when me and her were alone. he approved the WFH and the desk move. when I moved my desk when someone asked I didn't say because bully is nasty af I said because it has more room and is closer to other female coworker that my job is very intertwined with. this was not ok for bully and she cried to manager that she was upset I moved my desk.

causing me to go to HR.

I provided HR with a timeline, including emails, people who witnessed behavior or even just me crying. diary entries everything. and had told her I would be leaving if this isn't stopped. I remember her saying how unacceptable the behavior was. she called me with my manager where they told me how good my work was, that everyone loves me there and they'll take care of it. another call with manager and hr a week later they told me they were taking care of it but I am not to speak with my team about it. I assumed there would be mediation or something but no... weeks passed and to be fair I was ignoring bully which kind of worked although made me feel like I was on the outside of my team. months passed...

in April of this year bully thought it was appropriate to badmouth our director and his wife to me. I was so uncomfortable but looking around it appeared no one was in the area.

May our HR rep came for a week. I tried multiple times to set up a conversation with her all of which she declined giving me the 'few minutes before her Uber to the airport arrives' I said I was concerned given out the back/lab work was coming up and this is when bully seems to have it out for me. she said 'id be shocked if it happened again'.....

fast forward to why HR was approached formally the second time. bullies tactics have shifted. she now when I do not engage with her will flirt with crush... again she's married... this poor guy once walked into the office at 9am (just me and her there so far) and she jumped from her chair in a childish voice saying 'crush I need you I need your help'.. nothing in our job is so important it has to be done at 9am let the dude get his coffee. his actual response to her was 'can I at least put my bag down first?' 

she will enter into crushes office and laugh loudly at everything he says. The guy is funny but 'you put the amount in this box' shouldn't be met with the laugh of a 12yo who is talking about her favourite boy band.

two visitors arrived for 2 weeks and made comments to me about her childish behavior and the inappropriate way she was acting towards crush. I felt validated.

I spoke to HR rep about my concerns. The manager put in place, due to me being uncomfortable that I would WFH Monday and Thursday. she would WFH Tuesday and Friday with us both being in the office on Wednesday as the entire team of 8 are in. I have followed this, she has not.

HR I shit you not started our second meeting on this issue with 'shes upset'... at fucking what? that she's being made to answer for her behavior? that I'm working from home? that others are now noticing her behavior? and I said one of us has made nasty comments about the other, one of us has moved their desk to get away from the other, one of us has contacted hr twice about the others behavior, one of us has stepped back from things and is now walking on eggshells around the other and the other is a bully. I commented that hr should now even be trying to guilt me (this was what my last post was about) 

update- when I got to work a few days after my post, the bully was dancing and prancing around the office laughing like a 12 year old interacting with our team... this is apparently what being upset looks like. I left work in tears.

HR called me. tried to tell me that me crying is a problem and because of this my job is suffering (spoiler alert I'm very good at my job) they ended up putting me on a week of paid leave and wanted me to see a doctor.. I thought this was the firing pipeline. I explained everything to the Dr who said 'sounds like you're working with a narcissist... diagnosis acute stress disorder brought on by workplace bullying - avoid the trigger.

HR asked for a shared perspective to which I summed up the events from the kitchen incident including weaponising my lack of education (aka discrimination against my religious upbringing) 

HR formed their own opinion - my problem is 'im not an engineer'....

when speaking with hr on their bullshit outcome I was told - none of the stuff from those first 9 months was even looked at because 'it was sorted' when I told her it was not as she should have followed the bullying and discrimination policy back then for it she said she put it down to 'not nice comments' and called what happened to me 'a bit icky' 

In this conversation she tried to convince me to quit multiple times, told me this job is not right for me and told me if I brought it up again I might have disciplinary actions against me for my behavior - I'll remind you the only 'bad behavior' I've done in this whole 2 and a half years is cry usually privately or leave to WFH...

I attended a meeting with the extended team approx 25 people the day after where I do a presentation on my work year to date. my manager, director, several other people praised the work even stating I was the 'better sales person than the sales team' and that my areas budget for 2026 was increased due to my consistent work holding us up 3 years in a row.

I have let HR know I will not be accepting anything further until I speak with relevant outside parties in my response I cited our own policy, OHS legal requirements and other government parties that will hold my company to be accountable for this failure. I have looped in our director as he wasn't aware of what's been happening. I have contacted fair work, work safe for the possible psychological risk management failure, contacted our safety team who is confident they can get this sorted and contacted higher people in our HR organization structure. I told them I would take this as far as it needs to go not just for me but if I leave, the safety of the next person. 

I am also writing a formal complaint about the HR rep.

I had been edging here and there, but I stopped after reading more about the negative effects. I’ve always been a black coffee drinker, and I also take Concerta 54 mg when I’m working to help with focus. It helps a lot, but I want to push things to another level. With the holidays coming up, I feel like it’s the perfect time to experiment and reset a bit.

In the past, I’ve done multiple fasts, usually just water + salt and some black coffee during the day. Starting tomorrow, I’m planning to cut both Concerta (I didn’t take it today since it’s Saturday) and black coffee for at least the next two days to really see how my body and mind react without stimulants. It will be just water and electrolytes, for a total 72-hour fast.

I don’t usually experience brain fog or anything like that, but I’m tired of feeling this constant fatigue and I want to see if removing stimulants helps stabilize things.

If anyone has tips or has gone through something similar, I’d love to hear your experience. I’m already reading daily, journaling, and listening to a lot of violin music to stay grounded and focused.

1prukeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1prukeu/air_bnb_will_not_refund_over_7k/,air bnb will not refund over 7k,"

Shit show of a story but this is my first time in an air bnb (f 21) with my bf (m20) and mother (f49) as well as our dog.... this is an old reddit thread but im wondering if anyone has any thoughts or knows anything about air bnb policies (this is a long story plz bare with me)

My mother and i booked an airbnb in florida where she would be staying for over a month... the original dates were dec 17th-february 1st (i would be leaving december 28th to fly home)... whilst booking we informed the host that we have a 40 foot long rv (motorhome) and to please ensure that we have enough space in his driveway to park as well as an outlet near by to plug in the RV. He explained that his driveway was large enough and that an outlet was nearby to plug in. The day of arrival, our host would not message us back regarding a time to check in, nore did he give us the door code or any other information. We had informed him the evening before arrival that we would be arriving around 12pm... he never responded. We updated him when we were ten mins away at the time we previously stated and upon arrival the maid service who cleans the air bnb told us that we would need to wait an hour outside in the back yard until they were finished (we have a dog and it was around 82 degress F)... walking into the back yard we realized we were right across from THE INTERSTATE (this was NOT mentioned anywhere on airbnb) with trucks constantly honking at us as they saw us in the yard, we had to yell over the traffic to have a conversation.

the maids then also told us to park the motorhome on the grass as per the hosts request (we cannot park on grass as the weight of the RV would sink into the mud and we also would not be able to plug in the RV).... my mother was continuously messaging our host with no response regarding when we would be able to go inside (he did not respond)... finally after TWO HOURS he showed up, very polite but did tell us to park on the grass which we politely disagreed with... the maids in the home did not leave for over three more hours despite my mother telling them we dont mind some beds having no sheets etc as it was only three of us and we wanted some time to oursleves (we had made a 4 hour drive and wanted to unpack in private) now some topics i would like to address for later (keep these in mind)

1- the hot tub and pool - the host stated to us upon arrival that the hot tub was turned on for us but that we would not be able to heat the pool and hot tub at the same time. He told us to give the hot tub a few hours and that it would be warm that evening/the next morning

2-outdoor noise- the host stated that despite the noise people get used to it as it soon becomes comforting white noise.

that night my mother had to come downstairs to sleep in a single bed instead of the master bedroom because the noise from the interstate was so loud in her room (back of the house) that it kept her away until 3AM.

After about a day in the air bnb (half a day if you count the maids hanging out for multiple hours after the host left while we were trying to unpack- mind you they stayed till 4pm- i noticed through other postings on here that the usual check in time is 3pm however our host ghosted us for two days prior to arrival and did not tell us anything about arrival or check in nore did he tell us not to show up at the time we did) my mother and i decided that because she would be staying alone for a month she did not want to stay at this air bnb... she owns her own company and would be working whilst on vacation, a noisy freeway in the back yard would not work at all for making phone calls or attempting to relax/swim in the back yard. we texted the host explaining that we do not know if the noisy environment would work for us as it was not on the listing and continued to try to tough it out as finding storage for a 40 foot rv is extremely difficult as well as finding accomodation for ourselves around the holidays.

later the second day (december 18th) my lovely boyfriend and i decided to try to go in the hot tub... to find that it was cold... more than a day after the host had turned on the heater, we thought we'd try again the next day as maybe it was just taking a while... it was NOT, by the end of december 19th the hot tub still was not warm.

we messaged the host and he offered us a refund of 2000 dollars CANADIAN to leave the air bnb on december 22nd out of the 10,000 dollars we paid to be there until february 1st... this would mean we were essentially paying over 1000 dollars a night to stay for 5 days.

after reaching out to air bnb support and submitting photos and videos of the noise, and explaining that the hot tub did not work we asked if we could negotiate the refund amount as our host was not budging.

I am writing this on december 20th, the host stated that it was OUR FAULT that the hot tub did not work as we had it set on the wrong mode (HE set the mode the day we arrived and texted us multiple times stating that it is in fact working when we inquired about it) today he said it is now working (it is) two days before we leave. I explained this to air bnb as well as the master bedroom being unusable multiple times stating that 1000 dollars a day to not be able to use the amenities for more than half the time or some rooms in the home is absurd.

They have stated that it is up to the host and that they cannot do anything for us... is this normal?? what do we do? we have been as nice as possible including leaving a brand new keurig coffee maker in the home for the hosts future guests to use as we had accidentally bought 2 of them.

dont know if anyone will read this but it was worth a try

I'm making some progress

I found that:  
activated charcoal helps with toxins / gas bloating  
Broccoli sprouts help with calming the inflammation response  
Dandelion root helps with motility

I'm missing something to help seal and heal my gut lining potentially

I don't react to:  
avocados  
turkey  
potatoes  
corn flour tortillas  
olive oil  
carrots  
some leafy greens steam i think is better

The closest thing I can find is that I have LPS endotoxemia / dysbiosis

I react to:  
most proteins  
rice  
oils  
fermented products  
beans  
coffee  
acidic foods  
high histamine foods (maybe)  
sugar

The issue I'm having now is if I touch caffeine, chocolate,  cannabis i'm very sensitive to it and start spinning and lose sense of reality. Feels like I forget to breath. I would say this is like a panic attack mixed with depersonalization mixed with blinking out of reality like nothing feels real.

It lasts for about 2 hours typically. I think my nervous system, brain and heart can't handle stimulants, or maybe too much gets into the blood system too quickly?

Anyhow I'm looking to see if theres a way to mend this, maybe the gut lining is the final puzzle piece

My symtoms without any drugs or anything

stiff neck  
back pain  
bloating  
pressure  
inflammation (neck, head, occipitals, tension headaches, eye pressure)

I don't touch caffeine or cannabis but occasionally I'll test a tea, coffee, mocha or something to see if im still reacting. The good news is I'm not inflamming up immedietly like i used to with caffeine, however i accidently had a 8oz cup and feel like im losing control of reality.

Now, who wants to sit there for a half hour talking to someone for which you have zero interest. I have better things to do. So here's the trick: Get online at Starbucks and talk to her whole time waiting for your coffee to be prepared. Order her a coffee and pay for hers.  Once your coffee is prepped and handed to you as you are walking to sit down just say: ""Listen I'm not feeling any chemistry here. I'm going leave, but thank you for meeting me and good luck in your search"" And you just saved 30 to 45 minutes of yours and her time when there was no attraction.

She told me that she took a nap and asked to push it back an hour, which I agreed to. I said that I would message her before I left (due to my drive time) to make sure she was good to go. 

It took her half an hour to respond, so I told her I wasn't coming. Then she offered me her phone number and proceeded to say that it was my fault, even though she apologized multiple times. Wtf?

3) For the most part, the only semi-serious meetings I get are the ones that are first-night hookups. And I get a lot of compliments because I'm affectionate, I cuddle, I give foreplay, etc... They might even meet for a second night, but then they're ghosts.

Hey there, fellow Michiganders. I’m a 33 year old guy born and raised in this great, unpredictable, sometimes beautiful, sometimes ridiculous state we all keep choosing to live in. I’m hoping to meet someone local who actually gets what it’s like here, the shared trauma of potholes that could swallow a small car, the way we all pretend winter isn’t that bad until it is, and the collective joy that hits the moment temps reach 55 in the spring.

When the weather is on our side, I’m outside as much as possible. I’m big on hiking, kayaking, exploring trails, camping, and finding new spots around the state I haven’t checked out yet. Michigan really does give us some incredible days in the spring, summer, and fall, and I try not to waste a single one.

But once winter rolls in, I turn into a full homebody. Books, bingeworthy shows, strong coffee, and warmth become my entire personality from December through March. I love slow nights in, good conversation, and being around someone I can relax and be myself with.

Personality wise, I’m friendly, laid back, and easy to talk to. I’ve got a sarcastic streak, and once I’m comfortable around someone I get really silly and playful. I stay active and take care of myself, and I’m at a point in life where I appreciate consistency, honesty, and people who actually show up.

I’m open to chatting with someone around my age or older. What matters most to me is kindness, a sense of humor, and someone who wants to build something that feels natural and easy. Whether that turns into dating or something that grows at its own pace, I’m open to seeing where it leads.

1pruba5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pruba5/air_bnb_host_charging_1000_dollars_a_night_for/,air bnb host charging 1000 dollars a night for noisy home with unusable amenities??,"Shit show of a story but this is my first time in an air bnb (f 21) with my bf (m20) and mother (f49) as well as our dog.... this is an old reddit thread but im wondering if anyone has any thoughts or knows anything about air bnb policies (this is a long story plz bare with me)



My mother and i booked an airbnb in florida where she would be staying for over a month... the original dates were dec 17th-february 1st (i would be leaving december 28th to fly home)... whilst booking we informed the host that we have a 40 foot long rv (motorhome) and to please ensure that we have enough space in his driveway to park as well as an outlet near by to plug in the RV. He explained that his driveway was large enough and that an outlet was nearby to plug in. The day of arrival, our host would not message us back regarding a time to check in, nore did he give us the door code or any other information. We had informed him the evening before arrival that we would be arriving around 12pm... he never responded. We updated him when we were ten mins away at the time we previously stated and upon arrival the maid service who cleans the air bnb told us that we would need to wait an hour outside in the back yard until they were finished (we have a dog and it was around 82 degress F)... walking into the back yard we realized we were right across from THE INTERSTATE  (this was NOT mentioned anywhere on airbnb) with trucks constantly honking at us as they saw us in the yard, we had to yell over the traffic to have a conversation. 

the maids then also told us to park the motorhome on the grass as per the hosts request (we cannot park on grass as the weight of the RV would sink into the mud and we also would not be able to plug in the RV).... my mother was continuously messaging our host with no response regarding when we would be able to go inside (he did not respond)... finally after TWO HOURS he showed up, very polite but did tell us to park on the grass which we politely disagreed with... the maids in the home did not leave for over three more hours despite my mother telling them we dont mind some beds having no sheets etc as it was only three of us and we wanted some time to oursleves (we had made a 4 hour drive and wanted to unpack in private) now some topics i would like to address for later (keep these in mind)

1- the hot tub and pool - the host stated to us upon arrival that the hot tub was turned on for us but that we would not be able to heat the pool and hot tub at the same time. He told us to give the hot tub a few hours and that it would be warm that evening/the next morning

2-outdoor noise- the host stated that despite the noise people get used to it as it soon becomes comforting white noise. 

that night my mother had to come downstairs to sleep in a single bed instead of the master bedroom because the noise from the interstate was so loud in her room (back of the house) that it kept her away until 3AM.

  
After about a day in the air bnb (half a day if you count the maids hanging out for multiple hours after the host left while we were trying to unpack- mind you they stayed till 4pm- i noticed through other postings on here that the usual check in time is 3pm however our host ghosted us for two days prior to arrival and did not tell us anything about arrival or check in nore did he tell us not to show up at the time we did) my mother and i decided that because she would be staying alone for a month she did not want to stay at this air bnb... she owns her own company and would be working whilst on vacation, a noisy freeway in the back yard would not work at all for making phone calls or attempting to relax/swim in the back yard. we texted the host explaining that we do not know if the noisy environment would work for us as it was not on the listing and continued to try to tough it out as finding storage for a 40 foot rv is extremely difficult as well as finding accomodation for ourselves around the holidays. 

later the second day (december 18th) my lovely boyfriend and i decided to try to go in the hot tub... to find that it was cold... more than a day after the host had turned on the heater, we thought we'd try again the next day as maybe it was just taking a while... it was NOT, by the end of december 19th the hot tub still was not warm. 

we messaged the host and he offered us a refund of 2000 dollars CANADIAN to leave the air bnb on december 22nd out of the 10,000 dollars we paid to be there until february 1st... this would mean we were essentially paying over 1000 dollars a night to stay for 5 days. 

after reaching out to air bnb support and submitting photos and videos of the noise, and explaining that the hot tub did not work we asked if we could negotiate the refund amount as our host was not budging. 

I am writing this on december 20th, the host stated that it was OUR FAULT that the hot tub did not work as we had it set on the wrong mode (HE set the mode the day we arrived and texted us multiple times stating that it is in fact working when we inquired about it) today he said it is now working (it is) two days before we leave. I explained this to air bnb as well as the master bedroom being unusable multiple times stating that 1000 dollars a day to not be able to use the amenities for more than half the time or some rooms in the home is absurd. 

They have stated that it is up to the host and that they cannot do anything for us... is this normal?? what do we do? we have been as nice as possible including leaving a brand new keurig coffee maker in the home for the hosts future guests to use as we had accidentally bought 2 of them. 

dont know if anyone will read this but it was worth a try 

TLDR; air bnb host charging 1000 dollars a night for noisy home beside the interstate with broken amenities and unusable bedrooms despite us shortening our stay by over a month.",1,1766280724.0,Advice,4,0.67,False

# Meta’s New AI System Explained

**Meta’s new AI system** is called SAM Audio.

It’s a model that can isolate any sound from any recording.

Voices.

Instruments.

Ambient noise.

You name it.

It works like magic — but it’s real, and it’s available right now.

You don’t need multiple tools anymore.

One system handles everything.

You give it an audio file — like a podcast, a song, or a video clip — and tell it what you want to keep or remove.

It finds the exact sound and pulls it out instantly.

That’s how powerful **Meta’s new AI system** really is.



# How Meta’s New AI System Works

This model understands sound like never before.

It uses something called a **perception encoder** — a new way of teaching AI how to “hear” the world.

Old tools could barely separate a guitar from drums.

This one can tell the difference between a guitar, a piano, and a human voice all playing at the same time.

You can type a text prompt like “car horn” and it finds it.

Or you can point to a part of a video where a sound happens.

Or even select a time range — like “between 1:30 and 2:00.”

It then isolates or removes just that sound.

No manual EQing.

No plugins.

No wasted time.



# Meta Just Made Audio Editing Obsolete

If you’ve ever edited a podcast or video, you know how painful it is.

There’s always one sound you wish you could erase.

With **Meta’s new AI system**, you don’t need professional editing skills.

You just tell it what to do in plain English.

“Remove background chatter.”

“Keep the vocals only.”

“Extract the guitar.”

Done.

It’s that simple.

And the results? Studio quality.

This update changes the entire game for creators, musicians, and editors.



# Open Source: Meta Gave It Away

Here’s the wild part.

**Meta’s new AI system** isn’t locked behind a paywall.

They open-sourced it.

They released everything — the model, the benchmarks, the research paper, and even a playground where you can test it right now.

That means developers, musicians, editors, and anyone who works with sound can use it for free.

It’s not a teaser or beta.

It’s live.

And it already beats every other sound separation tool out there.



# What SAM Audio Can Actually Do

You can use it to:

* Remove background noise from podcasts
* Isolate vocals from songs
* Extract instruments from live recordings
* Fix messy video soundtracks
* Clean up noisy interviews
* Separate voices in a crowd

You type what you want, and it does the rest.

That’s the power of **Meta’s new AI system.**



# Real Example: Podcast Editing

Let’s say you recorded a podcast at a coffee shop.

There’s music, people talking, espresso machines, everything.

Normally, you’d spend hours cleaning it up.

Now you just type “background cafe noise.”

**Meta’s new AI system** removes it while keeping your voice perfect.

You don’t need expensive tools or plugins.

You just use the AI — and it works.

That’s hours saved and quality improved instantly.



# Real Example: Music Production

Imagine getting a live band recording.

You want to remix it, but you only need the vocals or guitar.

With **Meta’s new AI system**, you can point to the singer in the video and isolate their voice.

You can type “lead guitar” and extract that track alone.

You can pull out instruments, remix songs, and create cleaner stems.

This makes remixing and mastering faster than ever before.



# Meta’s New AI System for Video Creators

If you’re creating videos, this changes everything.

You can record anywhere — noisy streets, events, cafes — and still get studio-quality sound.

Just upload your audio, tell the AI what to remove, and it delivers clean output.

You can even save clips you thought were unusable.

That’s creative freedom.

It means you can focus on storytelling instead of fixing audio problems.



# How Meta’s New AI System Impacts Accessibility

This update isn’t just for creators.

It’s a huge win for accessibility.

By separating voices from noise, **Meta’s new AI system** makes transcription software more accurate.

That helps create better captions and subtitles for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.

It also helps improve hearing aid technology by isolating voices from background sounds.

That’s life-changing technology being released freely to the world.



# Speed = Power

Editing used to take hours.

Now it takes seconds.

That’s the real power of **Meta’s new AI system**.

Because speed compounds.

When you save time, you create more.

More content means more reach.

More reach means more customers.

That’s why this tool matters.

It doesn’t just make sound cleaner — it makes business faster.



# Why This Matters for Businesses

If your brand produces content — podcasts, videos, reels, ads — this tool gives you leverage.

You don’t have to outsource audio cleaning anymore.

You don’t need an editing team.

You can do it in-house with one prompt.

It’s faster, cheaper, and more scalable.

That’s why agencies, creators, and marketers should pay attention to **Meta’s new AI system.**

It’s not a gimmick.

It’s a workflow revolution.



# Limitations of Meta’s New AI System

It’s powerful, but not magic.

If your recording has 50 different overlapping sounds, it might struggle slightly.

And it’s not real-time yet on every device.

You’ll need to process files through Meta’s interface or run it locally with good hardware.

But for 95% of creators, it’s already miles ahead of anything else.

And because it’s open-source, it’ll only get better.



# Getting Started with Meta’s New AI System

You can try it right now on Meta’s official AI site.

Just upload an audio file and type what you want removed or isolated.

Or visit the **Segment Anything Playground**, where you can test live audio files.

If you’re a developer, you can even integrate the model into your own app.

The barrier to entry is almost zero.

All you need is audio — and an idea.



# The Future of Audio Editing

Audio editing has always been the hardest part of content creation.

Now, it’s the easiest.

**Meta’s new AI system** takes something that used to require skill and turns it into a simple instruction.

You don’t need software tutorials.

You don’t need a studio.

You just need to know what sound you want.

That’s how you know AI is maturing — when it stops feeling like tech and starts feeling like magic.
