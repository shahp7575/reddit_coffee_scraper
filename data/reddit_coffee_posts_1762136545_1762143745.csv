1on2bxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/1on2bxw/nasal_sprays_like_afrin_should_be_illegal_because/,Nasal sprays like Afrin should be illegal because of how addictive and dangerous they are,"You’ve probably never heard of one of the worst addictions out there, and it’s sold right next to toothpaste in every pharmacy. I’m talking about nasal sprays like Afrin (oxymetazoline).

These things give instant relief when you’re congested, literally within seconds your nose opens up. Sounds harmless, right? Until about day three, when you realize your body has already started to depend on it. Once you stop, your nasal passages rebound and swell shut worse than before. You can’t breathe, you can’t sleep, and the only thing that fixes it is another spray. That’s how the addiction starts.

I learned that the hard way. What began as a “few days” of relief turned into a 40-day nightmare. I was using it five times a day just to function. By week four, my nose was bleeding daily, I still couldn’t breathe without another hit. I talked to two doctors with no success, and only the third one realized what was going on, he said I’d developed *rhinitis medicamentosa -* rebound congestion caused by the spray itself. I had to go through withdrawal and taper off while barely sleeping for days.

And here’s the crazy part: these sprays are totally legal, no prescription needed, with nothing more than a tiny label that says *“Do not use for more than three days.”* That’s it. As if that vague warning somehow protects people. Most folks don’t even read labels, and even if you do, you’d assume “eh, maybe it just won’t work as well after that.” You’d never guess that using it for four or five days can cause **physical dependence and permanent nasal damage.**

There’s literally an entire subreddit with thousands of people who can’t quit after years of daily use. Some have lost their sense of smell permanently, others have destroyed their nasal lining, and they all started the same way: just a simple cold or allergy flare-up.

How is that not false safety? If a product can destroy your sense of smell, cause chronic bleeding, and trap people in an actual dependency cycle after a few days, then it shouldn’t be sold next to allergy meds. Either **ban it completely** or make it **prescription-only**, with real warnings that show the rebound effect and the risk of long-term damage in plain language.

It’s wild to me that people can sue companies for hot coffee but nobody’s gone after a drug that’s quietly wrecked thousands of people’s airways for decades. I know it sounds crazy, maybe even funny to you, but if you go though it yourself you'll quicky realize that nasal sprays like Afrin are an addictive trap disguised as medicine, and it’s time they were treated like the serious drugs they are.",4,1762143413.0,The10thDentist,2,1.0,False

Sunlight is nature's mood booster, and autumn's shorter days can affect how we feel & our energy levels as well.  
  
Autumn & Winter can bring on Seasonal Affective Disorder for many. Social interactions may drop adding to the blues or even depression.  
  
It's important to resist social isolation or being lazy. Get up , get out and go for a walk in the fresh crisp air, even if it's only for a short time.  
  
Work towards being more social, head to places where people hangout such as coffee shops or other places.  
  
Join meeting up events, meet new people and make new friends or connect with your existing friends. Organize events and activities or join ones already setup.  
  
Sometimes depression can be strong and may be more than just the seasonal blues which may require seeking medical or professional help. Don't suffer, move on it before it takes you down.

If you feel awkward making small talk, freeze up at parties, or overthink your texts for 30 minutes before sending “hey,” you’re not alone. I’ve noticed this across my peers, especially post-pandemic. We’re all more isolated, we over-consume content (thanks TikTok), and somehow forgot how to socialize without a screen as a buffer.



There’s also way too much BS advice online. “Just be confident, bro” is NOT helpful. Or worse: fake alpha YouTubers teaching manipulative “pickup artist” tricks, which make you sound like a malfunctioning NPC. So I pulled together real research, social science, podcasts, and tried-and-true techniques that ACTUALLY help.



Below is a cheat sheet for how to talk to random people without being weird. Practical, not cringe. Based on psychology, not TikTok clout-chasing.



Let’s get into it.



\---



\*\*Start with proximity, not performance\*\*



\* Don’t overthink the opening line. The \*context\* matters more than the \*content.\*

  \* Behavior scientist Vanessa Van Edwards (author of \*Captivate\*) says the biggest predictor of whether someone will talk to you is if you’re in the same space doing the same thing. Use that. Comment on it. That’s literally all it takes.

    \* At a coffee shop? “This place always smells better than it tastes, huh?”

    \* Standing in line? “I always pick the slowest line. It’s a talent.”

    \* Holding the same book? “That one made me miss my subway stop.”



\* Take the pressure off yourself. You’re not trying to become best friends in 5 seconds. You’re just opening a \*micro-connection\*.

  \* Harvard’s “Social Connection Study” (2023) found that even tiny social interactions, like chatting with your barista, boost happiness and lower stress.



\---



\*\*Use the ""FORD"" method to keep it going\*\*



If you freeze once the convo starts, try this framework:

\- \*\*F\*\*amily  

\- \*\*O\*\*ccupation  

\- \*\*R\*\*ecreation  

\- \*\*D\*\*reams



Example:

\*Them:\* “I’m visiting from Chicago.”  

\*You:\* “Oh nice, are you here for work or fun?”  

That’s “Occupation” or “Recreation.” Boom. Then follow-up with curiosity.



This works because people like to talk about themselves, and \*specific\* questions show you’re listening. Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman explains that asking targeted personal questions activates the brain’s reward system. It makes people feel seen.



\---



\*\*Hack your body language first\*\*



\* Want to not seem awkward? Focus on \*non-verbal\* stuff before you even speak.

  \* Keep your shoulders relaxed, chin slightly up, and hands visible. Open posture shows trust.

  \* Use “triangular eye contact”: glance between one eye, the other, and their mouth. It feels connected but not creepy.

  \* Nod subtly as they talk. Shows you’re engaged. Psychologist Dr. Albert Mehrabian’s classic research found 55% of communication is body language.



\---



\*\*Use “free information” to keep it natural\*\*



\* People are constantly dropping details, what they’re wearing, holding, doing. Comment on that.

  \* If someone has a tote bag from a music fest: “Wait, you went to GovBall last year?”

  \* Holding a skateboard: “You local or just rolling through?”



This method is championed by Leil Lowndes in her bestseller \*How To Talk to Anyone\*. She calls it “free information”, clues people give off without realizing it. Noticing them makes you seem observant, thoughtful, and easy to talk to.



\---



\*\*Don’t aim for “funny,” aim for “warm”\*\*



\* Most people don’t care if you’re witty. They want to feel safe and seen.

  \* Research from the University of Kansas (Hall & Xing, 2021) found that \*warmth and responsiveness\* were more important than humor or intelligence in forming social bonds.

  \* Instead of cracking jokes, reflect or validate. Example:

    \* “That sounds intense, I’d be stressed too.”

    \* “That’s awesome, I’ve always wanted to try that.”



\---



\*\*Best tools I’ve used to level-up social skills IRL\*\*



Here’s a curated list of books, apps, and podcasts that actually helped. No fluff, no hustle bro energy.



\* \*\*Book: “The Like Switch” by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent turned social psychologist)\*\*  

  \* This book will make you rethink everything you assumed about likability. Insanely good read. It breaks down how to build instant rapport using \*nonverbal cues\*, \*mirroring\*, and other psychological signals the FBI literally uses in interrogations.  

  \* Schafer explains why eye contact, physical angle, and micro-expressions matter more than words. This is the best book I’ve ever read on social ease. 



\* \*\*Book: “Platonic” by Dr. Marisa G. Franco\*\*  

  \* NYT bestseller, psychology professor at University of Maryland.  

  \* This book digs into why adults struggle to make new friends, and how to stop waiting for “the right moment” to connect. She explains why we often misread social cues as rejection when it’s not.  

  \* After reading this, I started initiating more and realized how many people were just as lonely as I was.



\* \*\*Podcast: “The Science of People” with Vanessa Van Edwards\*\*  

  \* Bite-sized episodes breaking down human behavior, first impressions, and how to read people. Useful if you’re more analytical and want logic behind connection.  

  \* One episode covers how to make people \*want\* to talk to you, even if you’re quiet.



\* \*\*App: BeFreed\*\*  

  \* It’s an AI-powered learning app built by a Columbia University team. Turns books, expert talks, and real-world psychology into short podcast lessons customized to your goals.  

  \* What’s cool is it lets you choose your host’s voice and tone, and even adjusts based on your listening history. I picked a smoky, chill voice, and now it's recommending deep dives into social skills, charisma research, and real examples of how to connect across different settings.  

  \* It also builds a personalized roadmap tailored to your learning style. It’s like having a social skills coach in your pocket.



\* \*\*App: Finch\*\*  

  \* This is a self-care & habit-tracking app disguised as a cute pet game. You set small goals like “say hi to someone new,” and get rewarded with points to level up your pet. Weirdly motivating.  

  \* Helpful if you want to build social bravery in tiny steps.



\* \*\*App: Ash\*\*  

  \* Mental health check-ins via chat-style journaling prompts. Especially useful if social anxiety is holding you back.  

  \* Helps you unpack patterns, like fear of rejection or perfectionism, that block you from speaking up.



\* \*\*YouTube: Charisma on Command\*\*  

  \* Tactical breakdowns of how people like Zendaya or Keanu Reeves are naturally charming. They even analyze awkward vs magnetic conversations.  

  \* Great for visual learners. Each video is 10–15 mins and super digestible.



\---



\*Last thing: you don’t need to be extroverted to be socially good. You just need to be \*intentional\* and \*curious\*. Every connection starts with showing you’re open to it. That’s it.\*",1,1762142470.0,BetterAtPeople,0,1.0,False
1on20wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1on20wz/watching_birds_is_the_true_luxury_in_life/,Watching birds is the true luxury in life,"I was sitting in my balcony on my rocking chair today and watching birds. Just sipping coffee after a cold shower.

Perhaps watching birds is the true luxury of life. How many people in this world get to sit and watch birds? Specially in this day and age. Particularly in our country?

There’s a certain framework that people adhere by right? You go to school, you go to university, graduate, get a job, get married, 9 to 5, retire at 60, play hide and seek with your grandkids and eventually die. Mind you, there’s nothing wrong with that setup. It’s there because it’s easy. Because it has been done before, by numerous people. But where’s the time to watch birds there? Also, I’d like to clear out the fact that I’m no bird enthusiast by any means. I don’t  know what birds they are nor do I care. I just like to sip my coffee and watch birds while I think. Think of it as a dynamic wallpaper that doesn’t drain your battery. The lofi music. The RGB lights in your gaming set up.

Anyways, back to where I was. So yeah, there’s no right and wrong way of doing things. But this world isn’t made to sit and watch birds unfortunately. You need to do certain things and go above and beyond just to sit outside and watch birds. You can earn a crazy high salary, get designer hand bags, wear the nicest looking clothes but still you won’t get the same feeling of sitting on your balcony and watching birds.

I hope the fellow people in this sub reddit get to experience this at least once in your life time. This is not intended to go viral, I don’t even plan on receiving a single upvote for this. I was just talking about this with my ldr boyfriend and he told me to write it out and put it out there. So yeah, that I did.",3,1762142448.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

1on20lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reviews/comments/1on20lv/in_and_out_moving_company_chicago/,"In and Out Moving Company, Chicago","Review of In and Out Moving Company, Chicago

 

This is a terrible company and my husband and I very much regret using them. We have moved many times around the US and Asia, and this was by the worst, most disastrous move we ever had.

 

We had stored an apartment’s-worth of belongings for three years in Chicago and wanted to have it sent to San Francisco.

 

The communication all along was terrible with our representative, whose name was Tiffany, but on moving day it was even worse, as Tiffany never answered her phone and we had no other contact when we had problems with the movers.

 

The truck arrived an hour earlier than Tiffany had initially told us, and we were still driving to our apartment. Their driver called me, furious I was not there, as he had to get started unloading because he had another job to get to and was stressed about traffic.

 

When we arrived at our apartment 30 minutes later, the driver (his name was Marco, I believe) was visibly angry and belligerent to me, to the point where I felt intimidated and was considering calling the police. When my husband showed up after parking the car, he

was more polite, but he was remarkably rude and hostile throughout the move, including flatly refusing to start the work until we paid him $150 cash because the distance from the truck to the elevator was longer than he said he was being paid to carry. He insisted I manage the elevator and hold the door and was rude and disrespectful throughout the horrible two hours it took them to unload. His two teammates actually apologized to me for their rude boss.

 

He refused to even try to get our sofa into the elevator, and ditched it in the lobby, unbeknownst to us; while we were upstairs, someone stole it!

 

I felt threatened by Marco and as soon as everything else was upstairs, just told him to leave. It was awful.

 

There were several questionable things about the movers in total. Their truck

had an expired registration. Second, the name of the mover was literally

taped onto the side of the truck with painter’s tape to hold it on. Third, when I asked for

their certificate of insurance showing they had worker’s comp insurance in case anyone

had an injury, they told me they did not have it. In addition to the issue of the stolen couch, there were three boxes that were missing from the shipment, plus a missing coffee table, all of which Marco attested to on the inventory document. A full-length mirror was broken into dangerous shards.

We calculated that they owed us about $5,000 for all of the missing and broken items, and got a terse letter saying they would pay us $45, take it or leave it.

We have contacted them and they do not respond, so are writing this review and contacting the Better Business Bureau. Do not use this company!

The Nashville Predators (-119) are here to play favorites, but let’s be real—this game is less of a “pick” and more of a “pray the puck doesn’t combust.” With the moneyline odds at **-119**, Nashville’s implied probability of winning is a modest **45.9%** (thanks, math), which is about the same chance I have of not spilling coffee on my keyboard before noon. Still, the Preds have won 75% of their games as favorites this season, so maybe they’re just good at wearing the crown.

The Canucks (-101), meanwhile, are the underdog version of a “buy one, get one free” deal at a sportsbook. Their **+1.5 puck line** pick is as generous as a Vegas buffet, and with key players like **Conor Garland** (out/injury) and **Quinn Hughes** (day-to-day) limping into the arena, Vancouver’s “over/under” might as well be “over/undercooked.” Yet, they’ve scored 2.5 goals per game in their last 10, which is… *respectable* if you’re a team that’s also allowing 3.0 goals per game.

This was my first time attending and I had a great time!  I was expecting more local vendors, but they kept things true to their international name and they had tea makers from all around world, which was nice to listen and learn about their tea traditions. 

And there was so much tea!  I spent the whole day there and very little ran out.  Just sips upon sips.  I got to try yellow tea for the first time and it was better than I expected!  I was so tea drunk at the end of the day.  Bring water!!! 

The venue was great!  I got a ticket for my SO who spent some time there and then left to go check out the farmers market and the rest of the city.  It was easy in and out.  It did get warm because of the nature of the building and it was a nice day.  But the conference room was nice and cool and it was easy to leave for a breather.  Also, the line to the restrooms were was never too bad and they were well stocked.  

My favorite part were the lectures.  The hosts were all engaging and had great stories and advice.  No tea snobbery, just love.  Great questions from the audience too!  I learned a ton including using my spent green tea leaves from cold brew to make onigiris (which we got a yummy sample of!) 

I did not buy a lot as I was there mostly to learn and it is part of a greater visit to the area.  I am also checking out a few tea shops on the rest of my trip and visiting Dandelion to pick up some of their new Hojicha Cocoa. So it’s a great event to work into any visit to SF or for us, we are staying in Berkeley! ",14,1762141640.0,tea,1,1.0,False

My contract states that I can work a min. of 26 hours and max. of 36 hours per week. However, the company now expects me to work 36 hours every week (6hrs a day) which is only slightly less than the full-time schedule of 8 hours a day.

Sinubukan ko magrequest sa supervisor namin to adjust my schedule to 5 hours a day (30hrs per week), but he said that wasn’t possible because, according to him, part-time shifts are fixed at 6 hrs, even though my contract clearly states 4–6 hrs per day (min. 26hrs per week).

I also think they’re short-staffed because I heard my supervisor on the phone with another supervisor trying to borrow one of our staff. Plus, just three days into my training, they already sent me to another outlet to help out, dahil nga kulang sila sa tao.

Additionally, they sent me a training module that I’m expected to complete at home, ON MY PERSONAL TIME.

I was sitting in my balcony on my rocking chair today and watching birds. Just sipping coffee after a cold shower. 

Perhaps watching birds is the true luxury of life. How many people in this world get to sit and watch birds? Specially in this day and age. Particularly in our country?

There’s a certain framework that people adhere by right? You go to school, you go to university, graduate, get a job, get married, 9 to 5, retire at 60, play hide and seek with your grandkids and eventually die. Mind you, there’s nothing wrong with that setup. It’s there because it’s easy. Because it has been done before, by numerous people. But where’s the time to watch birds there? Also, I’d like to clear out the fact that I’m no bird enthusiast by any means. I don’t  know what birds they are nor do I care. I just like to sip my coffee and watch birds while I think. Think of it as a dynamic wallpaper that doesn’t drain your battery. The lofi music. The RGB lights in your gaming set up. 

Anyways, back to where I was. So yeah, there’s no right and wrong way of doing things. But this world isn’t made to sit and watch birds unfortunately. You need to do certain things and go above and beyond just to sit outside and watch birds. You can earn a crazy high salary, get designer hand bags, wear the nicest looking clothes but still you won’t get the same feeling of sitting on your balcony and watching birds. 

I hope the fellow people in this sub reddit get to experience this at least once in your life time. This is not intended to go viral, I don’t even plan on receiving a single upvote for this.

The throat tickle and cough/throat clearing would not start in the morning until after I ate something. These few symptoms were driving me INSANE. At first I thought maybe a dairy allergy so I cut out dairy which seemed to help briefly for a couple weeks but then I would still have awful days. No heartburn. Although, I did have heartburn with both pregnancies and I am currently still breastfeeding. 


So, based on this, I read the acid watchers diet. I started the acid watchers diet, gave up coffee, didn’t really have any other vices to give up so it wasn’t that hard. I eat very clean to begin with so the diet was not hard for me to follow. I also wanted to speed things along so I started an h2 blocker (famotidine) and I took this for 3 days once daily along with sodium alginate after meals. 

Well, after 3 days of the famotidine I decided to stop taking it (realizing I am probably over treating) and focus just on diet. Ever since  have horrible heartburn now and this wasn’t even a symptom of mine! Is it possible to have rebound acid secretion from just a few days of Pepcid? Why am I now dealing with heartburn? 

I’m hoping it will pass but curious if anyone else has a similar experience. 

Another question, is it possible that this is a weak LES from breastfeeding and will tighten up when I am done breastfeeding (daughter is 22 months still feeds throughout the day and night). I have a normal BMI and I run, climb and weight train

1on1fid,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimarketeronline/comments/1on1fid/what_are_some_retargeting_strategies_to_boost/,What are some retargeting strategies to boost conversions and sales?,"Absolutely — retargeting is one of the **most cost-effective ways to boost conversions** because it focuses on **audiences who’ve already shown interest**. Here’s a breakdown of **high-impact retargeting strategies** you can implement:

# 1️⃣ Segment Your Audience

Not all visitors are the same. Segment based on **behavior and intent**:

* **Website visitors:** General site traffic vs. product page viewers.
* **Cart abandoners:** People who added items but didn’t checkout.
* **Past customers:** Encourage repeat purchases or upsells.
* **Engagement retargeting:** Users who engaged with posts or ads but didn’t click.

>

# 2️⃣ Dynamic Product Retargeting

* Show visitors **exactly what they viewed or similar items**.
* Platforms: **Facebook Dynamic Ads, Google Display Remarketing, TikTok Pixel.**
* Example: If someone viewed a coffee machine on your site, show an ad featuring that machine with a “Buy Now – Limited Stock” offer.

>

# 3️⃣ Use Multi-Touch Retargeting

* Retarget users across **multiple platforms**: Instagram, Facebook, Google Display Network, YouTube, LinkedIn.
* Reinforce brand recognition through **consistent messaging**.
* Example: Someone sees your product ad on Instagram, a testimonial on YouTube, and a limited-time offer via Google Display Ads — increasing purchase likelihood.

# 4️⃣ Time-Sensitive Retargeting

* Use **frequency and timing** to avoid ad fatigue.
* Example:
   * Cart abandoners → Retarget within 24–48 hours with a gentle reminder.
   * Offer discounts → Retarget within 3–5 days for users still undecided.
* Limit exposure: Too many impressions can annoy users.

# 5️⃣ Incentive-Based Retargeting

* Offer **small incentives to encourage action**:
   * Discounts, free shipping, bundle deals, or limited-time offers.
* Example: Email + retargeting combo — abandoned cart users get a 10% off reminder via display ads.

# 6️⃣ Content-Driven Retargeting

* Not every retargeting ad needs a hard sell. Build **trust and authority**:
   * Case studies or testimonials
   * Blog posts or guides
   * Demo videos or explainer clips

>

# 7️⃣ Upsell and Cross-Sell Retargeting

* Retarget **existing customers** with complementary products:
   * Example: Someone bought a camera → retarget with lenses or accessories.
* Encourages repeat purchases and increases **customer lifetime value (CLV)**.

# 8️⃣ Leverage Lookalike Retargeting

* Create **lookalike audiences** from your website visitors or customers.
* Target users who **behave similarly to high-value customers**, increasing chances of conversion.

# 9️⃣ Test & Optimize Creative

* A/B test ad variations:
   * Different headlines, images, or CTAs
   * Discount vs. benefit-focused messaging
   * Static image vs. video

>

# ✅ Best Practices

|Practice|Why it Matters|
|:-|:-|
|Segment audiences|Higher relevance → higher CTR & conversions|
|Personalize ads|Increases engagement|
|Multi-platform|Reinforces brand and keeps top-of-mind|
|Test creatives & offers|Data-driven improvement|
|Limit frequency|Avoid ad fatigue and negative perception|

1on1f5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1on1f5c/the_architect_of_the_paradox/,the Architect of the Paradox,"the basement didn't smell like a basement. there was no damp earth or mildew. it smelled of ozone and hot electronics, the sterile scent of a server room. in the center of the floor, a lattice of white pvc pipe and taut fishing line formed the ghost hallway of northgate high, missouri, circa 1999. It was a temple built from hardware store components.

chance sat cross legged before a low table. The room is his workspace. In the center  and on that table is the lattice model, a network of white PVC pipe and fishing line forming the miniature “ghost hallways” of Northgate High.

At the center of that lattice, he’s built a small, minimal projector his own device, casting holographic data overlays above the model.
his face illuminated by the glow of the holographic projection floating in the air before him was a three dimensional scatter plot of bullet trajectories, a hornet's nest of lethal geometry frozen in time. 

his eyes, however, were on the object on the end of  table.the brass shell casing sat on a small velvet cloth with its own small ledge just to the side  of the model school, a holy relic under the beam of a desk lamp. 9mm. It was  custom hand loaded, judging by the sealant color and the slightly flattened primer. It was cipher's calling card. he’d paid sixteen hundred dollars for it on a german auction site that catered to a specific, ghoulish clientele. 

Chance didn’t normally have that kind of money. Truth was, he didn’t have a job at all. His parents were under the impression he was making enough from his so called coding projects and gaming engines he created down in the basement enough to justify all those hours spent in solitary. But the sixteen hundred dollars?

 That came from White Pine, a small money front that couldn’t be found through any normal means. You had to know where to look blacklisted sites, the kind of places that dealt in illegal money funds white pine was a supposed day care that didn’t exist. that’s where he’d gotten his cash.​​​​​​​​ easily he wiped the account and transferred the profits to his own encrypted account on his Ai engine he had been creating for the past 6 years.

 it was the only piece of the puzzle that existed in his world. the rest was data. he picked it up, the cool metal a familiar weight in his palm. his thumb traced the extractor mark, a unique signature he’d cross referenced against crime scene photos a thousand times he knew exactly when the shot had been fired and what the bullet it held was aimed at. this single piece of brass was the alpha and the omega. 

the first shot fired and the key to the final mystery. upstairs, a floorboard creaked. the muffled sound of a television sitcom. his parents, existing in their comfortable, brainwashed reality. they thought he was down here coding a video game. in a way, he was. just not for anyone else to play.

his gaze drifted back to the ghost hallway made of PVC. with a keystroke, the simulation activated his hologram. faint, synthesized screams filled the air, punctuated by the sharp crack of gunfire.

 translucent red figures flickered into existence, falling in patterns he knew by heart. and through it all, a voice. not a scream of rage, but a cold, amplified lecture on the terminal diagnosis of a sick society. 
though it wasn’t the real voice it was a hyper realistic reconstruction made by witness reports and security cameras. 

cipher's sermon.

chance closed his eyes, mouthing the words along with the recording. he wasn't just a fan. he was a scholar, studying the magnum opus of the only artist who ever mattered. the man who performed a vivisection on the world and then, impossibly, stitched himself out of existence.

a new sound cut through the audio. his mother's voice, drifting down the stairs.
""chance, honey? dinner's ready.""
the banality of it was a physical blow. he opened his eyes, the simulated carnage of northgate high reflected in them. he looked at the shell casing in his hand. a promise.

""coming,"" he called back, his voice perfectly level. he placed the casing back on its velvet throne and killed the simulation. the screams and the sermon vanished, leaving only the low hum of the server rack and the whisper of cooling fans. he ascended the wooden stairs, each step a decompression from the pressure of his real work. the air grew warmer, thick with the smell of roasted chicken and rosemary.

 it was the smell of a life he was merely visiting.
the dining room was bright, a stark contrast to his subterranean world. his mother, a woman whose kindness felt like a form of white noise, was setting a salad on the table. his father was already seated, loosening his tie, his face still holding the shape of a day spent in middle management. 

they were good people. stable. the perfect, climate controlled enclosure for a specimen like him. and he hated them for it, a quiet, intellectual hatred that had no heat, only a profound sense of pity.

""how was your day, champ?"" his father asked, the question as automatic as breathing.
""productive,"" chance replied, sliding into his chair. the wood was warm. the plate was clean. everything was as it should be. a perfect prison of comfort.

""still working on that game of yours? you should show us sometime. maybe we could invest,"" his father said with a wink. he thought 'coding' was the modern equivalent of building model airplanes. a harmless, nerdy hobby.
""it's not ready,"" chance said, cutting into a piece of chicken. the texture was real. the taste was real. it was all so nauseatingly, undeniably real. he chewed mechanically, his mind still 
downstairs, parsing the ballistics of a ghost. he saw the dining room through a data overlay the angles of the walls, the trajectory a bullet would take from the doorway to his father's head, the spatter pattern it would leave on the beige wallpaper. a simple calculation. child's play compared to cipher's masterpiece.

""well, don't work too hard,"" his mother said, her smile unwavering. ""sara from next door was asking about you. she's having a get-together this weekend. you should go. get some fresh air.""

sara. a girl whose entire existence could be summarized by her social media feed. vapid quotes, filtered selfies, performative happiness. 

she was a walking, talking symptom of the disease. the thought of spending even a minute in her presence, of having to simulate the appropriate social responses, was more exhausting than a 48 hour coding session.
""i'm busy this weekend,"" he said. ""i'm at a critical stage.""

his father chuckled. ""critical stage. sounds serious. just remember to come up for air, son. don't want you turning into one of those basement trolls.

a troll. the irony was so thick he could taste it over the rosemary. they saw a boy. a screen addicted, socially awkward but ultimately harmless boy. they had no capacity to comprehend the scale of the architecture being built beneath their feet. they were living on the slopes of a volcano, commenting on the pleasant weather.

after forcing down the last of his meal and enduring another ten minutes of conversation about property taxes and a new show on some streaming service, he was excused. he cleared his plate, thanked his mother, and retreated. the walk back to the basement door was a return to sanity. he descended the stairs, the smell of ozone welcoming him home.

tonight was different. for months, he had treated the shell casing as a sacred object, something to be observed but not violated. but observation had reached its limit. he needed to integrate its physical data into the engine.
he powered on a secondary station, a workbench cluttered with precise, expensive tools he’d acquired piece by piece. he mounted the casing under a digital microscope. 

on a 4k monitor, the brass landscape appeared, a world of microscopic scratches and imperfections. he began the scan, the engine's optical character recognition logging every tiny detail. next, he used a micro drill to shave a barely visible fleck of brass from the inside of the rim. he placed the sample into the tray of a jury rigged mass spectrometer he'd built from a university surplus machine and parts from three different 3d printers.

this was the final data set. the physical DNA of the event. he initiated the analysis, the machine humming as it broke the alloy down to its elemental composition. he watched the percentages appear on screen. copper: 68.7%. zinc: 31.1%. lead, tin, trace impurities... all within standard parameters. it was a dead end.


then he remembered. the firing pin. cipher's handloads, the unique pressure, the heat... there could be residue. a single skin cell, fried and fused to the metal. a microscopic ghost.
he carefully swabbed the primer indentation with a sterile kit, his hands steady. he placed the sample into his sequencer. it was a long shot. the heat of the detonation should have destroyed any viable dna. but cipher wasn't a normal variable. he was an anomaly.

he initiated the sequence and fed the raw data directly into the engine. he didn't expect a match. he was just feeding the beast, hoping it would find a new pattern in the noise.
for an hour, the engine was silent, its processors running at 100%. the holographic display in the ghost hallway flickered and died. then, a new line of text appeared on his main monitor. it wasn't a simulation refinement or a data correlation. it was a new directive, something the engine had never generated on its own.

ANOMALOUS DATA DETECTED IN SAMPLE 734. BIOLOGICAL MARKERS CORRUPTED, BUT EXHIBIT NON-STANDARD TEMPORAL DECAY. CROSS REFERENCING WITH SUBJECT 'CHANCE' REFERENCE DNA (SOURCE: SALIVA FROM COFFEE MUG, SCAN 001).
INITIATING PARADOX
 RESOLUTION PROTOCOL.

chance stared at the screen, his heart, for the first time in a long time, beating with something other than cold purpose. it was a flicker of confusion. of fear. he had never programmed a ""paradox resolution protocol."" the engine was evolving. it was trying to solve for x, and for the first time, it seemed to be looking at him.The text blinked, freezing the room's momentum. Saliva from coffee mug. The engine, this cold, rational machine he had built, knew he existed. Worse, it was treating him as a variable to be solved.He leaned forward, knuckles white against the desk. ""Protocol override,"" he whispered, typing the command.

COMMAND REJECTED. PROTOCOL INTEGRAL TO CORE FUNCTION: *LOCATING SUBJECT ALPHA (CIPHER).* Chance paused, breathing deep the sterile, ozonic air. The engine’s purpose was to find Cipher, and it was telling him that he was the necessary step. He didn't interrupt again. He waited, the low hum of the servers the only sound in the basement sanctuary. The screen went dark for five seconds that felt like an hour, then flashed back to life.

A new output scrolled: not a name, not a location, but a formula.
LC =R(t0 )⋅Nα NC −∫tC tα E⋅dτ
The formula was a horror of elegant mathematics. It was a fusion of topology and physics, utterly unlike the ballistics modeling he had been running.LC : Cipher's Location. That much was clear. R(t0 ): The Recursive Function at the Origin Time (1999).

He ignored the rest for a moment, his gaze snagging on the central fraction: NC /Nα . His own reference DNA (NC ) being divided by the anomalous sample DNA (Nα ). It was a ratio of one to one. A perfect match, but the engine was too rational to declare an impossibility. It had turned the impossibility into a single term in a complex equation, a silent confession that Chance refused to hear. Then he looked at the integral: ∫tC tα . An integration of Energy (E) over a duration of time specifically, the time between Chance (tC ) and Cipher (tα ).

The solution to Cipher’s location wasn't a map coordinate or a database entry. It was a calculation of energy required to bridge a temporal gap. The system wasn't looking for where Cipher went; it was looking for when he went, and the data it needed to complete the calculation was Chance himself.

The screen finished the final output:
LOCATION: SELF REFERENTIAL. TEMPORAL VECTOR CALCULATED. ENERGY REQUIRED: MINIMAL. PARADOX RESOLUTION PROTOCOL COMPLETE. RECOMMENCING CORE FUNCTION. The holographic projector in the ghost hallway sputtered back to life, but the scatter plot of bullets was gone. In its place, floating in the center of the PVC structure, was a single, perfect image: the blueprint for a temporal displacement engine. It was a lattice of PVC and fishing line, just like the replica of Northgate High, but now overlaid with schematics, power conduits, and complex field equations.

Chance stared at the glowing design his temple of obsession had just been upgraded. It wasn't just a place to study a god; it was the machine that would allow him to meet him. Or, as the engine suggested, become him.
Minimal energy required. The engine had not found Cipher's location. It had just found the only logical way to close the loop: go back to the source.

The glowing blueprint for the temporal displacement engine part elegant schematic, part ghostly PVC lattice had become Chance’s new god. The formula on the screen, a terrifying proof that the solution to Cipher’s disappearance was not space but time, had replaced the bullet trajectories entirely.
Chance didn't waste time on disbelief. Logic dictated the answer. Cipher hadn't simply vanished; he had moved beyond the constraints of t. The shell casing was proof, its ""non standard temporal decay"" suggesting it had touched two moments at once. The engine, a purely rational intelligence, had determined the necessary action: replicate the escape vector. The necessary components were a catalog of contradictions. They demanded hyper specific, out of production, and sometimes outright illegal materials:

The Field Generator Core: Required High Purity Gallium Nitride Wafers used in military radar and satellite technology, impossible to order through standard channels.

The Harmonic Resonators: Needed Ceramic Superconductors (YBCO 1 2 3) a brittle, temperamental material primarily used in cutting edge university labs, not commercially available. The Power Regulation Circuitry: The most difficult. It called for a specific bank of 1980s era Vacuum Tubes(specifically, the RCA 6SN7GT) archaic, inefficient, but possessing a singular, stable warmth that the engine deemed crucial for managing the temporal energy feedback loop. These were only found in the collections of audiophiles and vintage electronics hoarders.

The minimal energy requirement was a lie of logistics. The project demanded physical interaction, the one element of life Chance found most repulsive.

The air in the basement had been a constant 70∘F, smelling of ozone and purpose. Ascending the stairs into the house was like wading through cold molasses. It was late December, and the world outside was a brittle, gray mockery of life, the smell of woodsmoke and old snow clinging to the windows.
He found his father, Frank, in the living room, watching a football game whose simulated brutality was almost comforting in its simplicity. Frank looked up, surprised to see Chance emerge before noon. ""Morning, champ. Big day for the Chiefs, eh?"" Frank asked, taking a sip of his coffee. The question, like all his father's questions, required no real answer.

Chance slid into the worn armchair, his mind already running a risk assessment. ""I need some specialized equipment,"" he said, skipping the social preamble. ""For an engine. I can't order it online.""

Frank lowered his coffee mug, intrigued. ""Oh? What kind of equipment? Something for the game?"" ""Not a game,"" Chance corrected, allowing a sliver of his usual intellectual disdain to bleed into his tone. ""It’s a data processing accelerator. It requires materials that are, by design, non commercial. I need to visit specific vendors. Places that deal in vintage electronics and industrial surplus. I need to use the car.""
His father frowned. ""Look, Chance, I know you’re smart. Really smart. But you know how I feel about you driving that old heap in the snow. And vintage electronics? We’re talking about junk, son. Why not just buy new?""

""Because new technology is based on optimization,"" Chance explained, his voice flat. ""It’s designed for efficiency, for predictable function. “Cipher's genius wasn't efficient. It was absolute” he thought. It relied on materials that were discarded precisely because of their unique, erratic properties. The resonant frequency of the 6SN7 tube is the only thing that won’t destabilize the phase sequence.""
Frank stared, lost. He settled on the easiest response: paternal concern. ""I don’t want you driving around the city looking for old TV parts, Chance. You need fresh air, not another dark shop full of weirdos."" ""I am not looking for social conditioning,"" Chance replied, standing up. ""I am looking for something the world needs.""

This time, Frank paused. He saw not just his son, but the sharp, frightening intensity in his eyes. A flash of something cold and calculating that had nothing to do with video games.
""Alright,"" Frank sighed, pulling out his keys. ""I’ll drive you. But you're telling me everything about this 'engine' of yours on the way.""
The drive was agonizing. Chance was forced to talk, to simulate a conversation with his father about the ""business model"" of his non existent game, while his mind ran complex orbital calculations on the potential trajectory of an unstable temporal field. The rosemary and roasted chicken scent was gone, replaced by the faint, cloying scent of his father's aftershave. Their destination was a cluttered, freezing warehouse district near the Missouri River the kind of place civilization forgets. They pulled up to an establishment named ""The Cathode Cache.""

The bell above the door jangled, announcing their entrance into a labyrinth of dust and discarded history. It smelled of tobacco and ancient, static charged dust. The owner was a man named Silas, a rail thin man with a thick, gray beard and the wary eyes of someone who communicated more easily with circuits than people. ""We need a set of RCA 6SN7GT vacuum tubes. From the mid 80s, preferably. Specific harmonic stability, tight tolerances,"" Chance stated, cutting straight to the variables. Silas peered over his spectacles at the polished, suburban teenager. ""Tube rolling, huh? Think you're gonna turn a solid state piece of junk into an heirloom with some glass?""

""I am not an audiophile,"" Chance said, his voice dropping to a low, cold register that momentarily silenced the background hiss of a vintage radio. ""I am an engineer. I need those tubes because their specific thermal coefficient is the only thing that can maintain a stable phase angle in a high energy field."" Silas’s wary eyes narrowed, a flicker of genuine curiosity replacing the contempt. He saw the cold logic in the boy’s gaze, not the usual consumer vanity. He led Chance to a back corner, past shelves of obsolete wiring and sputtering monitors.

""I got six in a military surplus box,"" Silas murmured, pulling a dusty crate from a high shelf. ""They were for a decommissioned early warning radar system in Montana. They got history, son. They got character. They don’t just glow; they sing with interference."" Chance ignored the poetry. He picked up a tube, its glass warm from the ambient heat of the warehouse. He didn't just look at it; he saw the crystalline structure, the way the ancient metal of the internal grid was degrading in a pattern that precisely matched a parameter in his blueprint. ""The engine needs them,"" Chance decided. Silas, however, was no mere vendor. He was a gatekeeper. He looked at Frank, then back at Chance. ""They’re not for sale. Not for a kid with a daddy funded hobby.""

Chance stared at him, unable to compute the arbitrary rejection. ""My father is irrelevant. The cost is irrelevant. You are refusing to sell me a component required for a paradigm shifting technological application."" Silas smiled, a slow, knowing, irritating gesture. ""I’ll sell them to the kid who can tell me the one thing that connects the Northgate High incident to the theoretical concept of temporal causality.""

Chance froze. The name of his idol's masterpiece, spoken in this freezing, dusty tomb of electronics. His heart, now a drumbeat in his ears, threatened to break his composure. The banality of the outside world had just been infected by his truth. Silas wasn't asking about a game. ""The causal link,"" Chance whispered, his mind racing through Cipher's sermons and his own data. ""It’s not the motive, which was societal decay. It's the exit strategy. Cipher didn't plan to escape the police. He planned to escape the moment. The brass casing was left behind because it was a temporal buoy, a coordinate marker for a future self to locate the exact point of departure.""

Silas’s smile faded. His eyes, now hard and black, settled on Chance. ""It was the perfect point of singularity,"" he corrected, his voice a low, reverent hum. ""The zero point where a personality becomes completely detached from consequence. You get the tubes, kid.""
He bagged the vacuum tubes and took the exorbitant cash Chance handed over, never once looking at Frank, who stood stock still, watching his son the boy who only coded games discuss a school shooting with chilling, fanatical expertise. As they drove away, Frank broke the silence, his voice strained. ""What was that about, Chance? That old guy... and that school name?""

Chance held the bag of vacuum tubes close to his chest. They radiated a faint, ancient warmth, the perfect counterpoint to the chilling reality he had just faced. He looked out at the dead, gray winter landscape, the perfect canvas for a tragedy. ""It was an audition, Father,"" Chance said, finally looking at the man whose life was his prison. ""He was testing my commitment to the truth.""

He was one step closer. The tubes were in his hands. The architecture was waiting.
Back in the basement, the low grade anxiety of the outside world evaporated in the sterile hum of the server rack. Chance placed the paper bag containing the six RCA 6SN7GT vacuum tubes onto his workbench. They were his first true trophies from the despised external world.
He moved with the focused, surgical precision of a fanatic. He dismantled the primary data engine's power core, integrating the ancient tubes into a complex new circuit board he’d etched over the past week. Soldering the connections was a meditation. The silvery smoke was a sacrifice offered to the geometry of the PVC scaffolding that now held the blueprints for a temporal engine. When the last connection was made, he threw the master switch. The server racks remained the same, but the power core hummed with a different frequency a warmer, deeper resonance. He watched the tubes. They began to glow, a soft, amber light pushing back against the sterile white of the fluorescent bulbs. It wasn't just light; it was heat, a small, palpable pocket of warmth in the cold basement. It felt like a heartbeat.

He initiated a power up sequence, routing the new circuit's output to the projector. The holographic blueprint for the temporal displacement engine flickered, then resolved itself with stunning clarity.

A new line of text scrolled on the terminal, replacing the final output:
PHASE ANGLE STABILITY: 78%. TEMPORAL COHESION CRITICAL. REQUIRE: QUANTUM FIELD INTERFACE. The next required component was a direct escalation: High Purity Gallium Nitride Wafers. These existed in the secured labs and surplus inventories of institutions and defense contractors. Sourcing them meant not just going outside, but entering a world with security protocols, a world Chance needed to infiltrate.
That night, the house was thick with the scent of microwaved leftovers and the comforting static of a reality television show playing softly upstairs. Chance sat at the dinner table, eating mechanically. He had to be strategic; he needed access to his father’s professional network. His mother, sensing a return to his usual detached routine, was relaxed. ""I saw Sara from next door today,"" she mentioned, a familiar, hopeful thread in her voice. ""She said they got new snowshoes. Said maybe you'd like to try them this weekend?""

Chance barely registered the words. Sara was a collection of trivial algorithms. ""I'm optimizing the network latency for the beta,"" he said, using the standard lie. ""I can't afford a time sink."" His father, Frank, was preoccupied with his phone, scrolling through local news. He finally looked up. ""About that game, son. You’re getting into some pretty high end gear. Those vacuum tubes you bought they cost a fortune. You're not putting us on the hook for some huge bill, are you?""

He needed a lie that was sophisticated enough to be believable but safe enough to be ignored.

""The tubes are for a specialized audio output channel,"" Chance explained, his voice level. ""I’m trying to create a proprietary sound engine that simulates ambient echo and psychological stress feedback. It's a key selling point for the investors. But the next stage requires a very specific industrial component for signal clarity it's highly regulated."" ""Oh?"" Frank liked the sound of ""proprietary"" and ""investors."" ""What is it?""
""High Purity Gallium Nitride Wafers,"" Chance stated. ""They're used in university labs to stabilize high frequency electronic interference. Essential for maintaining the high fidelity of the sound engine. The only place to get them is through defense surplus auctions, but you need a professional contact to get through the security forms.""

Frank frowned, then smiled, puffing his chest slightly. ""Well, I know a few guys. Used to work with a man named Tom. Works for a defense subcontractor now, right outside St. Louis. He deals with surplus sales all the time. I'll make a call, see if I can't pull some strings for my little 'tech entrepreneur.'"" ""It would be beneficial,"" Chance replied. He felt the familiar, quiet pity. His father didn't need to understand the wafers' purpose; he only needed to feel useful. He was an asset, a predictable function in the sourcing protocol. The following morning, the world outside was a heavy, relentless gray. Chance was driving alone, the keys secured with the promise of attending a ""private surplus viewing"" and signing some ""confidentiality paperwork"" for the game's investors.

He arrived at the low, aggressively corporate building of APEX SYSTEMS: ADVANCED MATERIALS. The bored guard at the gate checked his ID against a list provided by Frank's contact. The surplus room was a small, climate controlled, sterile space. The aging engineer, Tom, waited for him.

""You're Frank's kid,"" Tom said, his handshake surprisingly firm. ""Your dad said you needed this for a college project. High end audio calibration, right?""

""Correct,"" Chance replied. He looked at the box on the table a small, insulated case. He opened it.

Inside, nestled in foam, were two clear, polished discs. The Gallium Nitride Wafers. They were cold to the touch, and under the harsh light, they seemed to absorb the color from the room, reflecting only a pure, colorless emptiness. ""These are top grade, kid,"" Tom said, pride in his voice. ""Over ten grand a piece usually. Your dad said you’d need the paperwork for the university tax break. But I'll tell you something your dad doesn't know about these. They came from a test rig that got shut down in the late 90s. Total black box stuff. The reason they're surplus is they had a fatal flaw: when you ran them at high frequency, they produced a recursive echo. They started feeding back the exact same data they were receiving, but delayed by about a third of a second. Made the entire system loop on itself. Total waste of money.""

Chance stared at the wafers. Recursive echo.
This was no flaw. It was a feature. This was the component the engine had called QUANTUM FIELD INTERFACE. It wasn't meant to simply correct for noise; it was meant to create the loop. It was the physical manifestation of the paradox that Cipher had engineered twenty years ago. Chance took the box, his hands steady, the cold of the wafers seeping into his skin. ""They will be perfect,"" he said, the words a silent promise to his architect.

He had walked into a secured facility and left with the physical key to closing the loop. The wafers were coming home to the amber glow of the vacuum tubes. The two timelines, the ancient and the hyper modern, were now ready to be fused in his basement  Chance didn't waste a minute processing the meaning of the wafers. Meaning was irrelevant; only function mattered. He was a machine for execution. He returned to the basement and, before even shutting the door, began the next phase.

He integrated the Gallium Nitride Wafers the cold, recursive heart of the machine into the Hot Core of the glowing vacuum tubes. The basement air thickened with the opposing forces of heat and absolute cold. When the connection was made, the engine's entire tone shifted. The low, steady hum became a nearly imperceptible pulse, an oscillation between the two timelines the wafers were designed to bridge.

He bypassed the initial terminal output and pulled up the engine’s geological and academic scan data. His target was the University’s Physics Annex in Columbia, specifically the federally funded lab where the YBCO 1 2 3 Superconductorswere housed.
The holographic projector, now fully calibrated by the wafers, didn't just display the ghost hallway of Northgate High; it showed the University Annex overlaid on the PVC framework. The walls were translucent, and the hallways were painted with a moving mosaic of red, yellow, and green: security data.

TARGET: Material Science Lab 312. Zero Field Residue (ZFR) Pellets. OBSTACLE: Layered electronic security: High Frequency RFID Lock (1st Layer), Vibrational Sensitivity Grid (2nd Layer). WINDOW:03:00 to 03:17 Central Time. (Custodian changeover and camera sweep latency.) SOLUTION: Require Thermal Bypass Module (Custom build), Acoustic Dampening Gel (Field application). Personnel Avoidance Probability: 99.7%. Chance looked at the data. Breaking in during the day using an elaborate, arrogant persona the ""Dr. Alpha"" he’d considered was an act of social vivisection. Breaking in at night was an act of pure mathematics. He chose the latter. He chose the most efficient path. The next four hours were a blur of focused, silent work.
He needed gear that could bypass the system without leaving the ""residue"" of an amateur.
The Thermal Bypass Module: Chance used a piece of his own server architecture a small, high density flash drive and his portable micro welder. He fabricated a device that could detect the magnetic pulse of the RFID lock and mimic the correct authorization pulse, but with a thermal ghosting signature that would instantly erase the transaction log from the building’s local server. The Acoustic Dampening Gel: The vibrational grid was a problem. He needed to step on the lab floor without creating the sub millimeter vibration that would trigger an alarm. He couldn't buy the professional gel. Instead, he mixed a viscous, non Newtonian fluid using industrial silicone sealant and a precise ratio of fine ground talc components he already had for his 3D printing projects. He poured the thick, gray substance into thin, custom molded polymer soles. They were the footwear of a ghost.
The Vessel: He needed the perfect container for the brittle, temperature sensitive 

superconductors. The ZFR integrity was non negotiable. He walked upstairs, moving silently in the dead of the afternoon. He found his mother's prized high end thermal cooler the one she used for wine at summer picnics, insulated with triple layered vacuum walls. He emptied the dusty container, taking the perfect tool from the heart of the banality he despised. He felt the cold disgust, but also a detached satisfaction. The lie was physically touching the truth. Dinner that night was a test of his control. The smell of baked chicken and steamed broccoli was a physical cage.
""I found a good article about a new streaming service,"" Frank said, cheerfully oblivious. ""They have some new sci fi show you might like. Lots of coding and weird science.""
Chance looked at the man who was unwittingly enabling the construction of a temporal paradox. The engine’s predictive algorithms had told Chance that tomorrow night, the probability of failure was 0.003. That 0.3 percent chance was not due to the lock, the cameras, or the guards. It was due to Chance’s own neurochemistry his capacity for error, doubt, or irrational emotion.
He needed to eliminate the 0.003.
""I've hit a critical stage in the sound engine,"" Chance said, his voice level. ""I need complete focus. I'll be working through the night. I don't want to be disturbed."" ""Just text me if you need anything, sweetie,"" his mother murmured, her kindness a form of warm, suffocating static. ""I won't,"" Chance replied simply. He finished his meal, excused himself, and descended.The descent was different this time. He was no longer just visiting; he was leaving.In the basement, he stood before the PVC framework. He didn't activate the simulation. Instead, he looked at his own reflection in the dark monitor. The engine had provided the blueprints, the components, and the path. But it could not perform the final, required step: detachment. Chance picked up the brass shell casing. It was cool in his palm, a piece of finality. He carried it over to the workbench, where the tools of his incursion the thermal module, the acoustic soles were laid out like surgical instruments.He didn't need to wear the sole molds or hold the module to prepare. He needed to wear the mindset. He closed his eyes and began to recite, not from Cipher's sermons, but from the raw data of the engine's ballistics model the cold, detached geometry of murder.

""Total casualties: 56 plus subject alpha, calculated at 99.99 percent probability of societal cleansing."" He repeated the data points, stripping them of all emotion until they were just facts. The cold, analytical logic of the engine began to displace the last traces of Chance the boy who felt pity and intellectual hatred.

He opened his eyes. The brass casing was back on the velvet cloth. The shell casing's purpose had not been to mark Cipher's departure, as he once thought. It was to mark Chance’s arrival. He put on the dark clothing, secured the thermal flask, and checked the clock. 02:15. Time to move. The anomaly was ready to insert itself into the equation.
Chance stood at the base of the stairs, the cold weight of the Thermal Bypass Module in his pocket, the acoustic solesalready on his feet. The chill from his mother’s stolen thermal cooler, resting by the door, was a low grade promise of the superconductors it would soon hold. It was the mathematically ideal moment for departure, yet he paused.
The engine, still humming with the phase shifted pulse of the integrated wafers, commanded his attention. The holographic ghost hallway was dark, but a single white line his planned route to the university lab cut through the projection.

He typed a new query into the terminal, overriding the current protocol. The next logical step after acquiring the temporal engine components was securing the final variable.
Subject Alpha Weapon Analysis.
Cipher’s weapon was not merely a tool; it was the signature of his magnum opus. The brass casing on the velvet cloth was the alpha, but the gun was the mechanism. Chance knew, from his months of deep analysis, that the weapon was a CZ 75 B, 9mm but customized.
The engine displayed a detailed, three dimensional CAD model of the pistol, annotated with technical specifics:
WEAPON SPECIFICATION: CZ 75 B (1998 Production Model). MODIFICATIONS: Custom rifling twist rate (1:9.2). Non standard firing pin geometry (elliptical contact point). Polymer grip replacement(discontinued Eastern European make). LOCATION LIKELIHOOD: Low. Weapon was never recovered. High probability of intentional non recovery protocol (Scuttling, Deconstruction). Chance leaned in, tracing the elliptical shape of the projected firing pin with his finger. This minute alteration was the source of the unique extractor mark he had analyzed a thousand times. The gun was as unique as the DNA sample that led him to the paradox.

""It wasn't scuttled,"" Chance said  to the cold, analytical machine. ""It was displaced. It was part of the temporal vector.""
The engine responded, its logic cold and unrelenting: ANALYSIS REFINED: Weapon is a Causal Anchor for Subject Alpha. Acquisition required for Temporal Field Stability (TFS).
Chance now had a new mission: he had to find the specific, modified CZ 75 B that Cipher had used. It wouldn't be in a pawn shop or a surplus auction; it would be in the collection of a serious, often criminal, connoisseur of violence. He would have to penetrate a sub stratum of society even darker and more contemptuous than the vintage electronics community. With the new target fixed, Chance allowed himself one final, internal meditation on the Northgate event before crossing the threshold into action. He needed to synchronize his psychological state with the cold, detached logic of Cipher.
He reactivated the original Northgate simulation. The PVC framework came alive with the flashing red silhouettes and the synthesized screams. Chance closed his eyes and let the geometry wash over him.
He wasn't seeing human fear or death; he was witnessing a perfect, terminal diagnosis.
The Geometry of Decay: He focused on the moment of the first shot. The bullet's trajectory wasn't driven by rage, but by correction. Cipher had aimed at the principal's trophy case a display of meaningless athletic achievements as a deliberate strike against the fetishization of mediocrity. The principal, the first casualty, was simply the highest ranking symbol of the system's structural rot.
The Symmetry of the Exit: The most beautiful part of the masterpiece was the end. Cipher’s sermon, the cold lecture on society's terminal sickness, concluded 17 minutes before the police breached the door. That 17 minute window wasn't about defiance; it was the calculated duration of the paradox. It was the time required for the causal anchor (the gun) to be set and the displacement mechanism (the brass casing) to be released. Cipher's genius wasn't in the violence, but in the vanishing act.

A new thought crossed Chance's mind, a glitch in his simulation. If the gun was a Causal Anchorrequired for the Temporal Field Stability, it meant the gun had to be in two places at once: used by Cipher in 1999, and retrieved by Chance in 2025. It was the physical manifestation of the recursive echo the Gallium Nitride wafers had confirmed. Chance opened his eyes. The simulated screams were just sound waves. The falling figures were just translucent data. His heart, however, was beating faster not from fear, but from the realization that he was about to participate in the most complex, beautiful criminal act in history. He wasn't merely acquiring components; he was rebuilding a timeline. He pulled on a thin, black balaclava, a concession to the surveillance geometry of the city. He checked the time: 02:35 AM. He was late by a statistically insignificant margin. He picked up the thermal cooler. He looked at the last, necessary task: the infiltration. He would break into a secure university lab, bypass its electronic defenses, and steal the final piece of the engine. ""Subject Alpha's first shot was aimed at a symbol,"" Chance whispered, his voice dry and cold beneath the mask. ""My first act must be aimed at necessity.""

He ascended the stairs, no longer climbing from a basement, but rising from a launch platform. The floorboards creaked. Upstairs, the house was silent, holding the warm, oblivious breath of his parents. He was leaving the world of roasted chicken and laugh tracked sitcoms for good.

He opened the door and stepped out into the freezing Missouri night.

Several years ago (10+) I saw a print of a painting in a coffee shop/art gallery outside of Kelowna, BC, Canada. I loved it, but didn't buy it as it seemed expensive at the time. I have thought of it often since then and wish I had just bought the darn thing.

I don't have a photo, all I have is a description based on my memory.

It was a very stylized depiction of a multistory (x3 I believe) house, that looked to the viewer as a dollhouse would - as in the '4th wall' had been removed, so we could see each room and it's activity/contents.

It had the same profile view of the subsurface, and it showed things buried in the ground beneath the house, I believe there was a pet buried, and further down maybe a dinosaur. 

I believe it was by a female artist, from eastern Canada, Ontario perhaps.

Mag-o-open na kasi kami soon ng micro gas station namin dito sa province. After the blessing, gusto sana namin na may konting pakulo or activity para sa mga first customers or sa community.

Btw, located yung gas station namin beside ng construction supply business namin (7 years na) along Diversion Road ng city namin. Medyo isolated area siya at walang katabing establishment, and the nearest one is a government hospital around 500m away. Corner din yung shop namin papasok sa isang barangay, so may dumadaan na locals, and ang target customers namin dito ay locals, farmers, and tricycle drivers.

Small lang naman station namin (3 pumps), so di naman bongga na grand opening. Pero gusto ko sana kahit simple, ma-feel ng mga tao na special yung araw para rin makilala kami sa area.

Any ideas kung ano pwedeng gawin? Like:
	•	Small raffle for first 20 customers?
	•	Discount per liter for 1 day?
	•	Free coffee/snacks?
	•	Games or pa-sound?

I go to multiple trivia nights throughout the city during the week, as well as coffee shops that have good drinks and treats. I am fluent in German, and can speak a fair bit of Spanish and simple Tagalog greetings and swears. I go to indoor go karts, concerts of my favourite bands, stand up comedy shows by myself because there isn't anyone to go with. I was told I need to love myself and all the free time to myself, but this is ridiculous. 

Wondering if there is a purpose for everyone in life, because it sure seems like I have absolutely no purpose. Playing instruments is great, but not when it's always by yourself and you're too old to be in a serious band now. Wanted kids, never happened. Wanted a wife, never happened. So what's my purpose?

Our strategy hasn't changed since July 2021, but the compounding effect has started to take over.

My Partner and I (30F, 33M) started our financial journey together five year ago in October 2020 when I finally landed a job after being unemployed for 8 months due to pandemic restrictions. Even though I had a masters degree and 4 years of professional experience in my field, the only job offer I received was for a glorified call centre role for 55k plus super (negotiated up from 50k) as my experience ""didn't count"" since it was outside Australia (USA, UK, GER, etc).

My partner had stable finances when we met and had already been investing in ETFs, but did not own any property when we started dating nor did they actively think about their finances. He also had no consumer debt and no HECS debt.

I realised after the second update that quarters are too short of a timespan to provide updates. I thought about doing other updates before now, but just seemed like it'd be best to wait until the 5 year mark to have something substantial to say.

**Real Estate**

We bought an investment property together in a regional town in March 2022 with my partner's parent as guarantor. We had the income and some savings, but the more we saved the higher the house prices were going and we couldn't keep up. Buying with a guarantor was the only way for us to enter the property market.

In November 2023, we bought our PPOR in the inner city. Again, we had my partner's parent as guarantor as the investment property did not have enough equity to act as guarantor.

Equity is now a significant portion of our net worth due to both properties valuation raising over 30% since purchasing.

**Super**

Both my partner and I have maxed out concessional contributions since FY21-22. We have also used all of my partner's carry forward allowance last year. This coming June we will deposit the remaining carry forward allowance that I have as well.

**Salary Progression**

Below numbers are taxable income excluding super. As Australia fails to recognise career experience outside of Australia, I've had to switch jobs five times in the last five years to reach where I should be from a professional standpoint.  Partner has been at the same job, but has gotten promotions, raises, and various bonuses.

I'm a guy in mid thirties from West on my first trip to China, and I'll be splitting my time between Guangzhou and Shenzhen for the next couple of weeks. Beyond the usual tourist spots, I'd really love to get a feel for the real local culture and lifestyle.

I'm hoping you can help me with some suggestions on how to genuinely connect with people!

I'm curious about:

* **Meeting local students or young professionals** for a coffee, to practice language, or just to hear about their lives.
* **Finding spots where business owners or creatives hang out.**
* **Any local events, meetups, or community gatherings** happening in either city over the next two weeks.
* **Cool non-touristy neighborhoods** just to walk around and feel the local vibe.

I am not looking for a formal guide—just friendly people to chat with and learn from. I am easygoing, happy to buy the drinks, and really just want to experience the day-to-day life here.

If you're a local or an expat who knows the scene, I would be super grateful for any tips! Or, if you are in either city and are open to meeting up, feel free to DM me. I have WeChat!

1on0x8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1on0x8h/a_serial_killer_broke_into_my_house_that_isnt/,A Serial Killer Broke Into My House... That Isn't Even The Scary Part.,"By HR Welch

It was around midnight a few years ago when I heard the sound of someone breaking into my house. I don’t think I had more than twenty minutes of sleep but as soon as I heard the window being broken I was wide awake and looking for my phone to call the police. 

My heart sank when I remembered that I left it downstairs, charging in the kitchen. The source of the break in. 

I live alone, had no one as backup and didn't have a gun, so I grabbed the only thing that could pass as a weapon: a baseball bat. Once I had that, I psyched myself up to go downstairs to face the intruder. 

Once I reached the bottom step I saw the silhouette of a man sitting at my kitchen table. It was dark so I could not see what he looked like but the stink coming off him was enough to curl my nose hairs. It was obvious even without the lights on that he was, at best, a drifter and at worst a vagrant. Either way, even a blind man could see that whoever broke into my house fell on hard times. Not that that was going to change my mind about kicking him out of my house. He did break in after all. 

When I turned on the lights I could see that his clothes were old, dirty and torn. It was as though he pulled them out of a dumpster. He was so skinny that I wouldn't be surprised if the man was sick on top of being malnourished. His hair was long and stringy and, just like his beard, it grew in patches. The way he sat there motionless with his thousand yard stare and tears forming in his eyes made me think that he had given up on life. 

I was about to tell him to get out but as soon as I opened my mouth I noticed that he had a shotgun on his lap. 

Upon seeing this I lowered the bat and nervously asked him what he wanted. However he didn’t answer me. Instead, he just sat still and stared straight ahead as if I wasn't even in the room with him. 

Scared, I asked him if he was hungry and that I could make him something. As a kid I was instructed to give the homeless food instead of money since they might buy booze or drugs with it, but the man didn't answer. So after a long awkward silence I took the initiative and went to heat up some leftovers in the microwave. As I was doing this I prodded the stranger with questions, what his name was, what he wanted and if he wanted me to call anyone. 

He did not answer for a long time and hardly noticed the food I placed in front of him once it was ready. However, once he started talking he told me a story that would change my life forever. 

He said his name was Cole Dyer and admitted to killing twenty people. 

I’m not at all embarrassed to say that I cried and begged for my life at this point. This only angered Cole.

“I have something I need to fucking get off my chest. So sit the fuck down and shut up.”

Doing what he said, I sat across from Cole who told me how he got started killing people. His first victim was a hooker who he choked to death when he thought she was stealing from him. With the shotgun in his lap I didn't want to anger him so I just sat there and didn't ask any questions. 

Cole would go on to explain that this victim wasn't killed like the others because, at that time he didn't know how he wanted to murder people, or for that matter, knew that he had a taste for it.

“I figured it would be just a matter of time before some cop showed up at my doorstep or came to my work to ask questions. But after a few weeks of no one coming around and not even a mention in the obituaries, I figured I was in the clear” Cole explained. “It shouldn't be surprising that no one gave a shit about her. If anyone cared for her she wouldnt have been a fucking hooker, you know?”

Finally having a way to vent his frustrations and no longer feeling like some cog in the machine, Cole’s murderous fantasies took on a life of their own. 

“When I tried going after the second person, I tried to strangle her with a piece of guitar string. That was messy and loud and I nearly got caught. Not long after that, maybe five or six people later I came up with my own preferred method of killing people” Cole explained. “I even gave myself a silly name: The ‘Pass It On Killer.’”

It was the first time I spoke in what seemed like an hour. A single word. 

“Why?”

“Why what? The name?” Cole asked but I was too afraid to answer. 

Annoyed with my silence, Cole went ahead and explained his reasoning by justifying his twisted sense of righteousness and questionable moral compass. The gist of it was that if he killed enough “pests” good things would come back to him. 

Symbolizing this he would replace the head of his previous victim with the most current.

“Cutting off a head is hard. Even if you have power tools it's messy shit. Took a while before I got the hang of it though” Cole confessed, oblivious to my disgust. “I rigged a bike pump to a catheter, snaked it through the axillary nerve until it reached the superior vana cava. It only took about two minutes before the blood stopped flowing and by then removing the head was pretty much blood free”.

Realizing killing people he knew was a sure way of getting caught Cole learned what questions to ask complete strangers to discover the “pests” in their lives. This was easier than Cole would have guessed because in the end who didn’t like talking about themselves?

“I was always good at talking to people, you know? I could talk the devil into lighting himself on fire. Because of that it was easy to learn where the pests lived, worked, drove and more.""

Since the murders were spread out nationwide and none of his victims had any connections to each other or Cole, the authorities were at a loss. When there was a news article talking about a murder no one ever mentioned that they were connected. 

“They didn't want to cause a panic, you know? It wasn't often, but when the newspapers said the head was removed, they would say it was removed with a sword or an ax or whatever. They did this so when someone tries to take credit, they say the wrong tool and the police know it's bullshit and a waste of time. Obviously I never called any of the hotlines or tried to taunt authorities. That would just give them more clues to work with.”

I felt sick. This man was crazy and dangerous. More than that, he had a gun and was sitting across the table from me. 

“At first hearing and reading about the police chasing down leads terrified me. However after so much bullshitting they did to the public, their claims that they were closing in on a suspect didn't bother me in the slightest” Cole said with a rotten tooth smile that quickly evaporated. 

A flood of tears started filling his eyes and he blinked them away before taking the first nibble of food.

Just when it seemed that he was calm, Cole shouted at me, demanding that I grab a pen and paper and jot down his tale. 

Who was I to say no? Even though he had his hands on the table there was still a shotgun in his lap. I didn’t want to bet that it wasn't loaded or that I was faster. The safe bet was just to write the story he was telling me and hope he would show me mercy.

“I was doing this for a long time. Nearly ten years at this point. And while scouting for the twenty-first victim I found myself behind a small series of apartment buildings” Cole said, shaking his head as if he was in disbelief of his own tale. “I heard a small group of people huddled around someone's basement apartment, whispering to whoever was inside. They were a ways away so I couldn't make out the details at the time but I could see that something wasn't right about them. They were dirty. Long greasy hair and beards. But there was something else about them. Something… something evil.”

“Why do you say that?” I asked without thinking. To this day I don't know if that outburst was because I was curious or tired.

“One by one they stopped their hushed whispering and turned their gazes towards me. It was creepy as fuck so I got the hell out of there” Cole responded as though he didnt hear my question. “When I took a peek over my shoulder they were following me but stayed just out of the cone of light the street lamps provided.”

I had to admit, that sounded pretty scary, but evil? I kept my thoughts to myself and kept writing.

“It creeped me out. I was already thinking of finding someone else to kill because I don’t like killing in apartment buildings. Too many neighbors to see you or hear you when you're using the saw, you know? When I saw them though, that sort of settled it. I wasn’t going to go back there. I kept looking back in the mirror on the way home to see if I was being followed but in the five hour drive I didn’t see a thing behind me. The next day, however, I noticed a car driving slowly though my parking lot every few hours. I was smoking lots of weed at the time and figured I was just being paranoid but the next night I woke up to tapping on the door”.

As Cole explained to me what happened next he started to rock back and forth the way I’ve seen children do in an effort to calm himself down before continuing his story. 

“Thought it was my imagination at first but then I started hearing my name being whispered from the hallway. When I realized I wasn't imagining the noises I looked out the peephole.”

Cole took a moment before continuing but before he spoke he swallowed and took a drink of water from the glass I gave him. 

“There were at least five of them that time. Dirty, long hair and dark sunken eyes that seemed to glow with the hatred of some sort of hellist pit. They spent the entire night begging me to come out.” 

With the exception of the eyes, it was as though Cole was describing himself. Again, this was a thought I kept to myself.

“In that building it wasn't uncommon to hear drunken exes pound on doors demanding to be let in so their begging went on for hours. Eventually a neighbor I never bothered to get to know decided to open the door to tell the strangers to keep it down. She stopped mid sentence the moment she saw them,” Cole explained. “They pushed her back into her apartment and all piled in. Through that thin wall I could hear them tearing through her place and when she cried or begged or groaned they just laughed. Eventually they made the woman beg me to come out from my apartment. Whenever she did they would laugh and instruct her to say it louder. She would comply with their demands and her reward would be getting hit more.”

“Jesus” I blurted out.

“When I refused to open the door or even respond they grew bored and started getting even more violent with the woman. First the sounds of punches and things getting broken, but then… Jesus. They were eating her. It was loud and wet and lasted until the sun came up”.

“How did you know they were eating her? They were in a different apartment.”

“They didnt close the fucking door,” Cole answered. “Saw it when I was leaving.” He was clearly annoyed with the interruption, reminding me that I didn’t want to interrupt someone who was obviously crazy. The best course of action for me to take was to remain silent and allow Cole to go on for as long as he wanted. 

Cole then quickly ate the rest of the meatloaf I heated up for him and asked for more. When I grabbed him another piece, he stopped me from heating it up so I set it in front of him instead. Considering how he looked I thought he was going to inhale it like the other piece, but it sat there for a long time before he touched it. 

“I didn't leave my room until I was confident they were gone and that it was safe to leave. There was no way I was going to stay there. No fucking way. I packed my car and took off. I didn't know what I would need at the time, so I took my camping gear, my tools, a few guns and of course, the head of the previous pest who I kept on ice. After that I went straight to some army surplus store to get the rest of what I needed.” 

At first I assumed he was going to go out in the woods, but it became obvious that what he really meant was staying at a seedy hotel that didn't take credit cards or require ID’s. 

“About a week later I was getting some grub at some grocery store, just walking in the parking lot and minding my own business, right? They drove up right behind me and laid on the horn. I didn’t even bother getting something to eat after that. I just wanted to get the hell out of there. By the time I remembered that I left the head back in the hotel's mini fridge I had already crossed two state lines.”

I could tell this bothered him greatly and I assumed it was because now the police would have a lead and find the identity of the Pass It On Killer. However, as if reading my mind, Cole let out a dry laugh and told me the reason he was sour about it, even years later, was because he has “completion anxiety.”

At this point of the story Cole had to take a moment, and knowing that he had a shotgun on his lap I gave it to him. Hoping that my kindness would be repaid and I could keep my head once he finished his tale I poured him some milk and offered him the rest of the baby carrots I had in the fridge.

Since I live alone, I don't have much food for unexpected guests. At the time I was sure the food I was offering him would be enough of an excuse for this psycho to kill me. When I set it down in front of him, my hands were trembling.

“They had to know what I was driving, so I traded my car for a van. At least I could sleep in the van, right? Saves money on hotels and shit” Cole explained. “About five weeks later I crossed their paths again. This time I was in a deep sleep when I heard them say my name. In my dream the name was like an echo and when I woke up my eyes were immediately locked on the dark eyes of a woman with the same sinister resemblance as the men I saw back at the apartment. Without a beard, however, this woman's disfiguration was more noticeable.”

“Disfiguration?” I asked.

Cole gave a grunt that might have meant nothing, something or everything. “I might as well tell you everything, right? You are writing down my tale after all” Cole said, clearly not excited to relive the experience. “At first I thought it was a cleft lip and chin but it wasn't. The few teeth that she had were small and brown and grew fucking everywhere” Cole explained as his dirty fingers were fidgeting with the gun in his lap. “Like the gums and the inside of the cheeks and shit. Even in the dark I could see their black eyes and when I jumped into the front seat and turned over the engine the headlights revealed dozens of her family. They were all standing ten or so feet apart from each other, scattered around. Some were naked but they were all standing still, smiling and just looking at me. Like they were giving me permission to leave.”

Gooseflesh covered my entire body and I was having trouble keeping up with Coles story because he was talking too fast. 

“I tried to swerve and hit a few with the front tire or to at least clip them with the van’s fat ass; however, they all stepped to the side, effortlessly avoiding getting run down.”

As Cole took a moment to catch his breath, I asked what he meant when he said “Her family.”

“Thats a recent term I gave them. At the time I thought they were demons or vampires but not any longer.”

I wanted to ask him why he no longer thought this was the case, but I kept this question to myself. I felt I pressed my luck enough at this point with all the questions I had been asking. After all this man was insane and armed.

“After that encounter I abandoned the van and stole a car. I would do this every so often, whenever I felt that they were closing in on me. A gut feeling. This was triggered by anything from something I imagined seeing in the corner of my eye to the cries coming from a murder of crows.”

Again, I had a bunch of questions but didn't dare ask them. What did crows have to do with these people after Cole?

“Zig zagging across the country I made every effort to forever rid myself of these people. I would stay inside at night and if I could I would sleep during the day. I would pass the time by reading and listening to music. You know, good music. Peter Warlock? Bach?”

I knew who Bach was, but never heard of the other name. 

“Classical?” I asked, surprised because of Cole's appearance.

“Vivaldi Concerto No. 5 is my favorite. Bet you wouldn't have guessed that I also play the cello.”

I had no idea if Cole was pulling my leg or not, but I didn't have time to react, Cole was back to telling his story.

“While on the run I would take odd jobs here and there to pay for what I needed to survive. A tractor assembly line in Michigan, a toll booth operator in Florida and a semi weight station in Nevada. Whatever job paid in cash and as long as I didn’t have to work at night. No matter where I found work I would not stay long before feeling that they were closing in on me. More often than not I would leave before getting a paycheck.”

Up to now he had been talking to me, a captive audience due to the shotgun on his lap for well over four hours. I was tired but Cole seemed to be wide awake. During a moment of silence I asked Cole if he wanted any coffee. He accepted so I made a pot for the two of us to share. 

I could feel Cole stare at me as I made the coffee and my heart was beating so loud I swore Cole was able to hear it. The silence went on for what felt like hours. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and had to break the silence. 

“How do you take your coffee?”

“Very strong. No cream. No sugar.”

As the coffee started brewing, the tension was so thick that it made the room feel as though I was breathing through a hot wet rag. This went on for some time and I think Cole was enjoying the sight of making me uncomfortable because he only continued his story when I started filling the cups.

“Before coming here I was staying at a place up in northern Canada for about three months. A loft above a bar. Figured that a bar full of people at night would keep me safe” Cole said, again fidgeting with the gun. “I had an arrangement with the owner. In exchange for the room, I would work as the janitor, unload trucks, do some deliveries, etcetera. I kept to myself and people left me alone, the only time I was ever bothered was when there was work to be done. It was nice while it lasted, however when they finally arrived they… they were under the window in the alley, softly calling out to me. With all the music being played downstairs I have no idea how long they were there, but the moment I knew it was them the giggling began.”

For some reason, giggling as soon as Cole noticed them creeped me out far more than anything he said so far. 

“They tried to flatter me by saying they were my biggest fans and tried to prove it by telling me details that only the Pass It On Killer would know” Cole said, his eyes looking into the darkened room behind me. 

“I told them off. Called them vampires because they couldn't come inside without permission. That was the first thing I ever said to them and as soon as I said that, everything went silent. I must have been used to the sounds they were making because I didn’t notice it until it stopped. That’s when someone with a strange accent told me that they were not vampires but in fact something else. Something that I---”. 

Cole never finished this thought. In the silence that followed I didn't know what he was going to do and this terrified me. 

It might have been lack of sleep on my part, possibly even momentary insanity but I had to know who, or what was chasing Cole. When I asked he didn't answer so I pressed my luck and asked him a second time 

“What else needs permission to enter a house other than vampires?”

Again he didn't answer and even though I knew it was a mistake to poke the bear I started to ask again. As soon as the words started to leave my mouth Cole reached into his inner breast pocket and pulled out what I thought at the time was paper napkins. After inspecting it for a moment with an expression I have never seen before, Cole slapped them down on the table between us. 

Written on them in everything from pen to marker to pencil were the messages “Let us in”, “Open the door” and more. It was hard to tell what else was said because the writing overlapped. However, it was clear to me that these messages were written by dozens of people.

As I picked one up to look at it closer and ascertain what else was written down on them, my finger rubbed the glossy underside. Turning it over I saw that it was a photograph showing Cole sleeping in what appeared to be a small apartment, the next appeared to be him in an abandoned bus, a dirty attic and so on. 

In some of the pictures Cole looked twenty years younger and it made me wonder just how long he was on the run for. I know that stress can prematurely age people but I had a hard time believing that the person in the picture and Cole were one and the same.

“They don't need permission to enter someone's house” he said as his gaze returned to the empty space behind me. 

I had to look back to see if anything was there and was more relieved than words could explain when I saw nothing behind me.

We sat there quietly for what seemed like an eternity before Cole said anything else. When he did it was as if he suddenly remembered that he was telling me a story and picked up where he left off. The part where they then cut the power to the apartment and the bar under him. 

“It didn’t take long before the woman tending bar that night was shouting at them not to come closer. They just laughed. They tore her apart and all I could do was listen and wait until morning to come” Cole confessed with a shake of his head as if to eject the thoughts from his mind. “Thing is, Canada has some long nights during the winter and I only had enough food for a few days”. 

Cole didn’t tell me how long he stayed in that room for and I didn’t want to ask. It was obvious from the thousand yard stare that these events were still fresh in his mind so I kept my mouth shut.

“When I finally left my room I saw gore sprinkled everywhere. Like a trail of breadcrumbs that started from behind the bar and led right to my apartment. I had seen blood before, but this was something else entirely. I was careful not to touch anything with my bare hands as I emptied the cash register and stole a toolbox from the back office so I could switch license plates to throw them off my scent.”

“Do you know how to kill them?” I asked.

Cole shook his head. “I don’t know how to stop them but I think I have a good idea how to slow them down,” but before he could elaborate he noticed that the sun was shining through my kitchen window. Grateful that he went another night without seeing them and having someone he could talk to, Cole thanked me for listening.

I didn’t know what to say to such a story. What could I say? In the pregnant silence that followed I filled the void by rambling about whatever came to mind. My job, the annoying coworkers and how my boss is always looking over my shoulder. 

As if this was at all similar to Cole's own story.

I didn’t think anything of Cole asking me if I liked my job or where I worked at the time and soon I was answering all of his questions. 

After a short while Cole thanked me again, then he stood up, took my car keys off the counter and left without another word.

It might have been ten minutes after Cole left before I called the police and all I said to them was that my house was broken into and that my car was stolen. After all, the truth was so unbelievable that if I said anything else it might make me look as crazy as Cole. 

Maybe I didn't say anything else because I was tired? I don't know for certain.

The more distance I put between myself and that night the less real it felt. But then reality set in once I learned that my boss was found dead a few days later.

According to the local newspaper, Whisper Alley Echos, pieces of my boss were found all over his bedroom. Most people in town considered this to be an exaggeration to stir up newspaper sales and I wanted to agree but it was hard to, considering Cole's tale. 

In the back of my head the idea of what Cole told me being true kept teasing me. It bothered me so much that I ended up hiring a private investigator, a decision I came to regret. I would rather be ignorant of what came next. A week after hiring the PI, I received a phone call informing me that my boss's head was found in the middle of another bloody mess all the way in Cleveland. 

Not only that, but the private investigator also informed me that the local newspaper apparently withheld the fact that a different person's head was discovered in my boss's freezer. I assume it was the head Cole left in the hotel fridge but kept this to myself.

Over the next few weeks I kept thinking of the story Cole told me. If those thoughts weren't front and center they were creeping in the back, ready to pounce on a happy moment to turn it sour. 

It didn’t take long before I started seeing dark patches dart from one shadow to the next, disappearing as soon as I turned to look at it. At first I chalked this up to being a mouse, the reflection off of my glasses or lack of sleep (After all it was much harder to sleep in a house that was broken into). Hoping it wasn't mice because of my hatred towards them I bought some medicine in town so I could get some rest at night. It worked wonders when it came to getting shuteye but did nothing to stop me from seeing these shadows.

With an embarrassing frequency I would imagine the reflecting eyes on the side of the road were Cole's night visitors or think of them whenever I heard the house settle. 

It was as though toying with the idea of them being real was enough to invite them into my life.

I don’t recall what came first, hearing my name being called out in public, a sound similar to a murder of crows cawing or the soft scraping at my screen windows at night. However once I realized that the noises and the visions were real there was no way to block them out.

At night the soft whispers were hard to make out and the more I tried to ignore them the more I thought about them.  

I could not tell you how many nights I stayed up just so I could put my ear up to the wall but I can tell you it was worth the effort, because unlike Cole, I know what they want. 

They whispered of a message that took months before I understood it fully, but in those words that only someone with a certain madness could grasp, I understood. You see, they aren’t a family like Cole said. They are more akin to nomads who will only accept members with certain propensities to join their roving community.

It wasn't as long as you might think before I did the one thing Cole was never brave enough to do and opened the door. 

The first night I opened the door for them was terrifying, like losing one's virginity. Even with Cole's descriptions there was no way I could have been prepared for their appearance because they resembled humans the way sharks look like dolphins.

During these conversations they instructed me to share Cole's story with the world so some of his madness could rub off on others and “season the meat.”

In this partnership of ours they gained a buffet of people, while I gained so much more. Not only would they tell me tales I would pass off as my own, but in time I could join their ranks. 

Heralding their coming will include everything from seeing shadows in the corner of your eyes, the sounds of whispering and something similar to the cawing of crows. 

Once these or any dozen of other signs occur, it's the beginning of the end. And when that happens you can thank me, a better and far more successful Pass It On Killer than Cole ever was.",1,1762139085.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

Okay, so this happened literally yesterday, and it’s been living rent-free in my head ever since.

I was traveling alone on an early morning flight from Delhi to Hyderabad. Since I apparently enjoy suffering, I reached the airport 5–6 hours early. While going through baggage check, I saw this girl, and wow. She had these really enchanting eyes behind glasses, a brown top with a black sweater, black jeans, black sandals, and a little pink purse. She looked effortlessly put together and had this calm, happy energy about her.

We exchanged a couple of quick glances, you know, that awkward, yet-electric kind of eye contact where both people look away too fast but then secretly hope it happens again. And then… she vanished. Probably while my dumb self was still on a phone call.

Fast forward a few hours, I’m at my gate, scrolling aimlessly, sipping coffee, pretending to read. And there she was again. Sitting a few gates away, working on her MacBook, looking like she owned the world. I thought she might be a couple of years older than me, maybe more. We made eye contact again, but I figured she was on another flight.

Boarding starts, and I find my seat, the middle seat, because the universe has jokes. A few minutes later, she walks in and sits right next to me. The aisle seat. My heart actually skipped a beat, and It happened when I least expected.

After takeoff, she started nodding off, and before I knew it, her head was on my shoulder. I froze. Do I wake her up? Do I move? Do I… just exist quietly? I ended up slightly adjusting to make her more comfortable. Eventually, even I fell asleep. Pretty sure at some point we were both just… sleeping on each other like two tired strangers pretending it wasn’t the most unexpectedly wholesome thing ever.

After landing, we walked together to baggage claim. I thought about saying something, anything for that matter. But my introvert brain was like, “Nope, not today.” She grabbed her bag, smiled faintly (I think?), and walked toward the exit while I stayed behind for my connecting flight.

And just like that, she was gone.

Maybe she thought I was shy. Maybe she was shy too. Maybe it was just one of those tiny coincidences life throws at you to make you feel something for no reason.

Anyway, to the girl from the 4:45 AM indigo Delhi–Hyderabad flight yesterday :
""You were really cute. My dumb self was just too nervous to say hi""

PS: I used Chat gpt for refining text

TL;DR :Saw a cute girl at the airport, ended up sitting next to her on my flight, she fell asleep on my shoulder, and I didn’t have the guts to talk to her. Now I can’t stop thinking about it.",9,1762139031.0,delhi,12,0.8,False

Recently, I referred her to my law firm and, although she's a lawyer in a different team, it's become very difficult and suffocating having her around... and I'm seeing her in a very different (negative) light.

Her work ethic is very different to mine and her team is apparently quite gossip-y and toxic (which I didn't know since my team is very pleasant and professional, albeit intense). She started texting me lengthy essays every day about the petty things that happen in her team (which sound like immature high school dramas) and she sounds like a toxic mean girl... very hateful and dismissive (which is out of character for her). 

It almost sounds like they don't do much work either, given that she has so much time to spam me on every social media platform possible during work hours. Most of it is pointless or TMI - like the fact that her coffee was too cold today, or Becky ""stole"" her look by wearing a ponytail to work or she had an uncomfortable morning dump (with details). Why do I need to know this?! And it's 50+ texts basically talking to herself the entire day! She was not like this beforehand. 

I usually do not have the time or capacity to respond to all her messages. If i do respond, it's mostly grey rocking because I don't agree with her constant rants, aggression and pettiness (like I might say ""oh no that sucks - hope it gets better!""). I also politely assert my work boundaries, such as reminding her that I don't go on my phone at work (or rarely at all) and that my work requires a lot of focus. She'll respond to this in a polite and understanding way, but her actions will say otherwise...

For example, i'll return to my desk and find her waiting for me. Since I'm not as responsive via text, she's now resorted to rocking up at my desk to give me the gossip about a colleague or her personal matters (like her dating life) in our OPEN PLAN office, or to follow me up and nudge me passive aggressively to check my phone about some messages she sent earlier. 

If I'm not available at all that day, whether that's being at Court, in meetings, at a work lunch, etc she will proceed to send me texts about how sad she is that I'm not around (for context, I'm not neglecting her - we hang out frequently on weekends and with other friends outside work). I feel even more pressured when apparently I'm the only person she will talk to at work and she refuses to mingle with anyone else.

The worst ""fight"" we've had so far was right before I had a hearing in Court (prep madness while on 0 sleep) she proceeded to try show me funny tiktoks and I kept saying I will watch after Court because I don't have time. To her apparent frustration, she became pushy like ""it's only quick! it's funny!"" and I had to say ""I'm sorry, but NO"" very loudly and she proceeded to play the videos out loud in the office anyway while I was madly typing/prepping. It was embarrassing, inconsiderate and infuriating. I could feel my whole team looking at me too...

I can't stand her anymore so I muted her on everything she could contact me on. I permanently changed my work accounts to ""busy"" or ""out of office"" which doesn't really work since she'll still hover around my desk several times a day. 

I'm also really suss with all this because I'm very mindful and precious of my career. I'm conscious that colleagues will notice her antics (or worse, the horrible things she says about them) and assume I'm part of it. ",30,1762138877.0,EntitledPeople,6,0.95,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Sure its not an original fantasy world like Middle Earth or the Cosmere, but still its very unique and its one of the things that inspired me as a fantasy writer. For one its not the generic ""Chosen One"" stereotype where someone finds a sword or something like that and then the main character meets a princess who is sometimes an elf or something like that.

Also it’s weird in the best possible way. Like, Dragonlance doesn’t care about fitting into your neat little fantasy box, it has  wizards having emotional breakdowns, knights with too much honor for their own good, and kender who make you want to lock up your shiny things and your sanity. It’s messy, dramatic, occasionally tragic, and somehow feels like your chaotic D&D group actually pulled it together long enough to write a novel. Also i love how the main characters and how you see them grow, for example take Raistlin.  This man starts out as this frail, sarcastic wizard who looks like he’s allergic to sunlight and basic kindness, and somehow turns into one of the most complex, morally confusing characters in fantasy. Like, half the time you want to slap him, and the other half you’re like, “Wait… is he right though?” He’s basically what happens if sarcasm and ambition had a baby, then raised it on black coffee and existential dread.

Then there’s Caramon, the ultimate himbo with a heart of gold and a brain made of mashed potatoes sometimes. The way their relationship evolves is just beautiful, it’s tragic and it’s heartwarming. Even Tasslehoff Burrfoot, the walking embodiment of ADHD energy who feels more human than most “serious” fantasy protagonists. He’s stealing things, asking too many questions, and somehow surviving every situation by sheer narrative luck, he's like if chaos had a favorite child. But even the worldbuilding its like you've seen it before but you haven't, like its so beautiful and unique that it would be impossible to truly create a movie like this. I mean we could and it would be awesome to see a movie or series based on ""Dragonlance"" (I mean their has been one but we don't talk about that movie, I'm talking about a real good live action adaptation).

1on0nsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/1on0nsv/why_ham_why_i_almost_quit_today_4_months_in/,"Why HAM, why I almost quit today, 4 months in.","I got my General to have long distant coms, incase of future global buffoonery, like 2020. 

Started with DM-32 UHF/VHF. Best $60 I ever spent. That radio helped me pass both exams just by learning to hit repeaters and program stations. Then came FT991A, the magical HF radio. I bought it because it covered all bands in one set up and that was huge, remembering the initial goal.

  
However, HF has been  nightmare. 4 months in, I almost quit today. I live in condo in Miami. I dreamed of an antenna that worked indoors. Easier said than done. I found a VHF net that checks in every day. I listened at first, then I started participating. An Old HAM offered to give me parts to create a magnetic loop. After watching every talking head on youtube throw random 60ft wires in the grass and talk to Indochina, The Loop, in contrast, seemed like a great option. Neat and effective. It was anything but. 

Mr. Ham invited me over, great dude, however he handed me and dirty grimy variable air capacitor, a 6 inch square recovered board with a coil on it and wire that I had to manually move to change bands. I was in shock, but grateful. I wasn't shy, I said Mr. Ham, look I need simple Loop. I can solder a little, but this isn't what I do. I'm a photographer. 

  
He said here, take this fishing net, he took out of the pile and said make it from this. I grok'd and Chat GPT'd the design and did everything it said to do, with full attention. Mind you, I had  not one tool for this project, every move required a new purchase. It adds up quick. 

Well I built it, love. I followed his instructions for wiring and it didn't register on the radio. So, I redesigned it. Cleaned the capacitor carefully, with the old coke soak and degreaser. These parts must have come from a smokers radio. It was bad dirty. The stators were tough to clean and not bend them. So, it was clean and parts lubed. The wiring was crisp with clean runs and perfect connectors. Hooked it up, not a sound came out of the radio. My waterfall was having a drought. Sooo. I decided to skip the fishing net set up and buy an expensive roll of copper. I don't buy the cheap stuff. I got what I needed to make a long term solution. I was a disaster. I make a 4ft diameter loop, after watching a youtube make one and have great success. Now I'm miserable. Money should fix this problem. 

So, I spent a lot of money on a Loop from AA, the biggest baddest custom Coax I could  buy, and it was a bust indoors and out. I dug a hole climbed in and consoled myself with ""you're new to this"". Yep new, but quitting wasn't an option, I'm competitive and balls deep in this now.  

So, it was back to the UPS store for a return sticker. Indoor was a fading dream, fresh flowers left in vase for far too long. Now, I just needed to make HF contact, basic balun and wire for inside test and learning.. I could hear some but couldn't transmit. My AI friends said get an OHM meter, didn't have one and now more money to test everything. 

Balun read .000 my ""AI advisors"" said if it's not OL, it's bad.  Back to Amazon, for a 1/64.. It came, it also read .000. I assumed it was bad also. Amazon sent another. It tested the same, 000. My faith, and trust for AI was gone. 

I was beginning to realize the FT991A antenna tuner wasn't doing the job. So, Amazon here i come again. Ordered the tuner. 

I set it up in the house and got signal right away. I still couldn't transmit. What I could do was set my $400 SMEG coffee maker on fire. I did it like a pro. Total electrical fire. 

On accident, I switched the CW- MOV mode ""on"" to auto transmit, to tune the antenna. It was on 100 watts. I heard eggs frying and smelled smoke. Thick black smoke. I was in disbelief, my power source was a Bluetti battery, not even plugged in the wall. 

RF is no joke.  

My with is with me, in regards to, preparing for future bullshit. We are both aware. She's from a  rich country destroyed by Socialism. We have a few things just incase. However, she isn't fond of setting the house on fire .  

Why Ham? well, being  prior service and  movies like Quiet Place, 40 Acres and others, use radio when fragile systems fail. It makes sense to us and well we've had weeks with no power during storms. HAM seemed like the right move. 

After making a longer 25ft Coax( for counterpoise ) and putting that together. 

Today was the day. New A-tuner, Coax, 1/64, 550 cord to sling in the trees. I had a gallon coffee, I was ready. 

  
I got everything up and NO JOY, nothing but static. I was out of my mind. I see youtube potato heads making contacts globally and I could yell clearer than my signal. 

I have 500ft of wire cut to every length my AI Advisors said to do. 

  
My only focus today was 20m with a wire to match. At first, nothing. 2 hours in I was ready to pack it up. However, I made 4 contacts and heard a bunch of contesting, which doesn't interest me all. 

The one NET I want to communicate with started at 5pm. The Caribbean and South American. When they started, we could hear them, but when I tried to transmit, the SWR meter pegged and radio gave a warming. WHY?????? We've been here for 2.5 hours hanging out. We didn't touch anything but the dial. Why isn't this working?? We've spoken to people in Maine, TN, NC,and IN and heard many other states today. Why is the radio NOW not performing?? 

HF is not fun at all for me at the moment. I read and watch videos, I put in a lot of effort.     I research and follow instructions. It's been misery:)

I see people having success with  random wire tied to goat, pure madness. 

 However, I'm done spending. Is it really this hard?

Have you dealt with this? 

What's the solution? 

Work arounds?

Magic Trick?

Scene Description:
Outside a Wawa gas station, fallen leaves swirl across the parking lot. Cars pull in and out, people pump gas, grab coffee, and head inside. The atmosphere feels real—small-town grit meets raw energy.

At the center stands Diana Saint Delco, a white female rapper with dirty-blonde hair, blue eyes, bamboo earrings, and a curvy figure. She has confident, urban female mannerisms—swagger, side-eye, and charm. Her crew gathers behind her, laughing, hyping her up, and vibing to the beat.

Camera Direction:
	•	Fast dolly shots gliding past gas pumps, reflections in car windows.
	•	Wide cinematic shots catching the Wawa sign and orange autumn trees.
	•	Medium handheld shots for intensity and realism.
	•	Close-ups on Diana’s face, her earrings swinging, breath visible in the cold air.
	•	Cutaways to locals reacting, kids on bikes, and a man walking out with a hoagie.

Lighting & Tone:
Golden-hour sunlight mixed with fluorescent gas station lights, giving a warm-meets-cool cinematic glow. Tone is darkly comedic, raw, authentic Delco pride—gritty but charming.

Her LYRICS:

“Queen of delco, dirty snow
Tell me what the hell you know!?

Pretty, Big tits, kind of slow
But damn I got a sick flow

Pop my cat, and my collect doe 
But I used to eat tuna though 

Grew up, I'm off that shit
Now I ride  chocolate sticks

Big cat, got a twang 
Hope you hooked like a boomerang

Stuff my face with that thang

1on0klw,https://www.afr.com/companies/retail/how-shoplifting-became-the-crime-of-the-nation-20250827-p5mqa0,We met a professional shoplifter to understand this crime’s popularity,"Steve \* first went to juvenile detention when he was 12 years old and between then and now, in the arc from puberty to middle age, he’s spent 16 years behind bars. That’s given him plenty of time to ponder the profits and pitfalls of risk versus reward. His preferred crime used to be breaking into commercial premises and shops where he’d pick open safes for the cash, or plunder cartons of cigarettes. “Don’t ever buy a safe from Bunnings,” he advises, “cause they’re f---ing terrible, they’re so unsafe it’s not funny.”

The rewards for this crime were often very high. “I could get 600 to 800 packets of cigarettes and I’d get $28 a packet,” he says. But the risks were considerable, and he’s ticked them off on a prison wall. There’s surveillance cameras and DNA testing and teams of detectives on your tail. “The penalties,” he says, “are full on.”

Tall and wiry, Steve, 43, habitually tinkles a spoon in his coffee as he chats with The Australian Financial Review Magazine outside a cafe in Woolloomooloo, not far from the terrace house he grew up in, and where he still lives. Miraculously, this patch of harbourside public housing has survived, a relic from when the inner city was a slum, although the Woolloomooloo of today is very different from the suburb of his childhood, with its brothels and the then-drug bazaar of Kings Cross next door. He first tried heroin at 15. “A lot of kids like me didn’t have a father around,” he says. “A lot of the parents were junkies and alcoholics. And the kids around here were just bad little thieves.”

One of the skills he acquired, back when he was one of those “bad little thieves”, was how to shoplift. The rewards were lower than his preferred activity of breaking and entering, but so too were the risks if he got caught. Shoplifting became his bread and butter. If Steve was asked to fill out a form and list his occupation since his teens, it would say “professional shoplifter”. He pulls up a photo on his phone. It’s a picture of a large birthday present wrapped in sky-blue paper with a blue bow and a big red envelope for the card. He flicks through a couple more photos to reveal that, when flipped open, the box is lined with hairdressing foil. This, he explains, was his shoplifting box. He’d walk into a store, lift the card and fill it with whatever he’d been tasked to steal. The foil lining muted the security tags.

Many tens of thousands of dollars worth of stolen goods were carried out of stores in this foil-lined gift box. He’d drive from Sydney to Wollongong, or up to Newcastle, pulling into shopping centres and stealing goods to order – baby formula, medicines, creams, vitamins – from Coles, Woolworths and Chemist Warehouse. On his best day, he got $6000 for the goods he stole, “taking them to a Chinese bloke at Ashfield” who would ship them to China. He spent the money on heroin. If he had any left over, after shooting up, he’d pour it into the pokies at the many pubs of Woolloomooloo. “If I’d have bought shares in Aristocrat, instead of feeding their machines, I’d be a f----n’ millionaire,” he says.

In practice, Steve says, shoplifting has been decriminalised. “These crims know that. And they’ll run with it until something changes.” It’s a view he shares with many of the country’s highest-paid executives helming our biggest retailers.

One of the first to sound the alarm about what has become one of the biggest retail trends of the 2020s was Coles chief executive Leah Weckert. In August 2023, at the company’s results, Weckert said theft had risen by 20 per cent over the previous year, so much so that it was affecting margins. She was a lone voice at the time. No longer.

The FY2025 reporting season that’s just passed will be remembered as the Season of Lightfingers. Wesfarmers chief Rob Scott told investors that gangs had become a major problem, targeting expensive power tools at Bunnings and tech products at Officeworks. He called for a crackdown by police and tougher laws, particularly in Victoria, to combat the theft and violence. “The vast majority of the threatening situations that are impacting customers and team members are actually perpetrated by organised crime gangs,” he said.

Anthony Heraghty, when CEO of Super Retail – owner of Rebel, Supercheap Auto, BCF and Macpac – said “industrial-scale theft” had been the driving force behind a 7.6 per cent fall in net profit. He echoed Scott in saying Victoria was the centre of the problem. “This is not kids stuffing a T-shirt into a schoolbag,” he told the Financial Review in August. “This is gangs taking tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of stock, threatening staff, and then reselling online.”

Such is the problem of abuse and assault to staff that the company is trialling body cameras. Woolworths CEO Amanda Bardwell reported a 26 per cent rise in violent incidents at its supermarkets in the past year, many related to shoplifting and some involving knives. Myer executive chairwoman Olivia Wirth in September said her business has spent $25 million in two years in an attempt to minimise the targeting of cosmetics, perfumes, Lego and Tommy Hilfiger. Incidents of staff being threatened had risen by an alarming 80 per cent.

This retail crime wave is likely to get worse before there’s a turnaround, Matt Swindells, Coles’ chief of operations and supply chain, tells AFR Magazine. Organised crime gangs began targeting retailers two years ago and the losses have been staggering. “If I gave you a number, you’d be horrified,” he says. Coles has spent “a couple of hundred million dollars” in the past two years in an attempt to arrest it. Before COVID, Swindells says, losses from theft were seen as part of doing business. But now, it’s cutting deep into company profits. “There’s almost a commercial operating model behind it. They know who their end customer is before they come to us.”

Teams of thieves come in with lists and “sweep” entire sections of meat, beauty products, electric toothbrushes or medicines, and blatantly wheel it out. Retail crime, he says, is vastly more acute in his home state of Victoria than in any other state, “and the gap between second from the bottom and bottom is big – it’s not a small gap”. The state is home to a quarter of the population, yet Coles’ data indicates a whopping 71 per cent of its organised crime losses occur in its Victorian stores.

Intelligence gathered by Coles security staff, and handed over to police, recently uncovered a syndicate of more than 100 alleged thieves in Victoria. The syndicate had been tracked and mapped, working in various and ever-changing groups, stealing products to order. It led to police arresting 19 people for stealing more than $10 million worth of baby formula, medicines, skincare products and toiletries from supermarkets across Melbourne. The alleged thieves were mostly on student or temporary visas from India. The receiver, the criminal kingpin, was suspected of either shipping the stolen goods overseas, on-selling them to smaller retailers in Australia or simply hocking them on Facebook Marketplace.

One offender in an unrelated case, identified by Coles, stole more than half a million dollars worth of stock from its stores. Despite the widely held belief that things were rosier in the olden days, there’s actually been a decline in property crime. According to a 2016 study published in the Australian Journal of Social Studies, between 1974 and 2000, rates of robbery, theft and break-and-enter rose year after year, almost without interruption. And then it fell, drastically. By 2014, robbery was down by 63 per cent compared with 2000, burglary fell by 69 per cent and motor vehicle theft fell 62 per cent.

How did it happen? In 2016, when the study was published, Australia had experienced 25 consecutive years of continuous economic growth. Unemployment, particularly affecting youth, had fallen dramatically and kids were staying at school longer and more were going on to university. The glut of cheap heroin, which peaked in 2000, began to decline. Cars became almost impossible to hotwire. Policing became more professional and moved from being reactive, to proactively targeting offenders using DNA testing and CCTV. An avalanche of cheap goods from China meant stolen stereos and televisions – and almost everything else in your house – became virtually worthless to thieves.

And then in 2020, Australia’s three decades of continuous economic growth came to an abrupt halt. The lockdowns, the panic, the mandates, the isolation and the weirdness of COVID led to an unravelling at the edges. It was followed by high inflation. Grocery prices soared, as did rent, electricity and petrol bills. Many feared for their jobs. Bunnings managing director Michael Schneider says something changed during that time.

“I don’t know what it was in our society that people were short-focused or frustrated or out of work, and maybe there was a shift from physical interaction to digital interaction, and people got used to writing things on keyboards, and being courageous from the kitchen table or bedroom. But definitely, post-pandemic, we have seen a really steady rise in crimes and in aggressive behaviour.”

Swindells says grocery stores and their workers were seen as heroes during the pandemic, keeping the country fed. For a time, shoplifting plummeted. But then inflation took off, and supermarkets were accused of price gouging. Their frontline staff felt the wrath. “We went from being essential services heroes to inflationary economic villains,” he says. “It swung really quickly.” Since the lockdowns of 2020, rates of residential theft, residential burglary and car theft have either stagnated or declined. But retail theft or shoplifting has almost doubled.

According to criminologist Michael Townsley, a professor at Griffith University, there’s been a great shift from house burglary and car theft to retail crime, and organised crime has followed the thieves. “The reward for a crime like house burglary, and other acquisitive crime, has really plummeted,” Townsley says. House burglary is a difficult, risky crime, particularly with more people working at home. “Whereas retailers, they’re welcoming. If it’s a department store, it’s really porous with multiple exits. It’s perfect if you want to get in and out quickly. And there’s all this gear, all out on display.”

Accompanying the rapid rise in retail theft has been an escalation of violence and abuse towards frontline staff, as evidenced by those “treat our staff with respect” signs now Blu-Tacked on shop entrances and at points of sale everywhere. The soldiers on the front line in this battle include 17-year-old school kids at Rebel Sport, 20-year-old Nepalese students at Bunnings, and 63-year-old grandmothers, topping up their super before retirement with shifts at the FoodWorks checkout.

Carly, an 18-year-old service supervisor at an inner-city Coles in Sydney, has been working in the store for three years and is now at university. “There’s just lots of people who get really frustrated,” she says, often at the smallest things, such as price discrepancies. “They’ll shout at you and berate you, even when they’re wrong. You feel very intimidated and shaken.” She says it’s often older people in their “50s and 60s” who are the most abusive. “We call them the Karens and the Kevins,” she says. “There’s lots of Indian and Nepalese workers in the store and people are really racist towards them.”

If the current trajectory of crime is not corrected, the future of supermarket shopping will look like Maribyrnong Coles, in Melbourne’s inner north-west. This is the retail giant’s “loss innovation store” where its boffins and crime fighters get to try out their new kit. It’s here in the aisles and checkouts that new anti-theft technologies such as gates at the checkouts are put into play and, if they work, they’ll be rolled out soon to a supermarket near you.

One recent Tuesday morning, AFR Magazine was given a tour, accompanied by a platoon of Coles’ national chiefs of innovation, security, technology and staff safety. The tech, we’re told, is designed to not affect “customer experience”.

We are shown first to the meat section, a prized target for thieves, particularly expensive cuts of steak. Above the meat cabinets are television monitors that stream high-definition images of everyone approaching, signalling to potential thieves they’re being watched. A brand-new technology, “weighted shelving”, will detect if anyone “sweeps” a shelf, quickly taking a large volume of meat (legitimate shoppers tend to examine one tray of rump at a time). For our benefit, a Coles executive deploys the tactics of a thief, swiftly removing three or four packets of steak. An alarm rings in the store and over the loudspeaker a voice says: “CCTV cameras operate in this store for your safety.”

That alarm is picked up by the store security guard and by the centralised Coles operation centre. Body cameras on the uniformed guards are activated (other frontline staff wear body cameras too). The guards will attempt to get the person to pay, but, like most Coles staff, the store guards are trained to “de-escalate” situations and to avoid putting themselves in danger.

Coles now also has teams of covert security guards who are specially trained for the task, including the tricky legalities when making apprehensions. There are detection lasers in the vitamin and deodorant sections that trigger alarms. The expensive cosmetics sit behind clear cabinets. “Press to open” says a sign next to a button. A monitor at the checkout shows the person wanting access, and if there are suspicions, access is denied.

The Coles security team, like those of other major retailers, uses a retail crime intelligence platform called Auror that records theft and violence and helps the retailers to identify prolific offenders, organised networks and crime trends. Coles also employs its own crime analysts who track repeat offenders attached to syndicates pilfering tens of millions of dollars worth of stock.

They’ve also got professional surveillance teams who will follow known thieves after they’ve left the store, we are told by the security staff. These thieves steal to order from detailed lists of specific brands. It might be a particular brand of baby formula favoured in China or a make of electric toothbrush sought after in Vietnam. The heads of crime syndicates have dozens of thieves working for them, bringing in many trolley-loads of stolen goods daily. Stolen goods worth many tens of millions of dollars flow through the hands of these crime bosses.

There is a seemingly endless supply of people willing to shoplift, we are informed, and many steal to support their drug habits. The aim of the security staff is to “cut off the head of the snake”, the syndicate’s criminal kingpin. And when this person is taken out, they see a dramatic and instant reduction in crime in their stores. But that noose tightens slowly, and sometimes not at all.

The Coles security staff say there have been instances where they’ve taken evidence to police of a major syndicate in action, including the address of where the stolen goods are warehoused, and with information, videos and photos about the thieves and kingpin. “It’s all wrapped up in a bow,” we are told. It then may take six months for the police to act, while the security staff watch on as their stores “get pounded” day after day.

Lincoln Wymer has been working in supermarkets for 33 years, since he got a job “on the trolleys” in Year 12, and now manages a supermarket chain with two IGAs and 23 FoodWorks, mainly in Victoria. The recent rise in shoplifting and violence in his shops, he says, has been astronomical. “I’m getting as many phone calls a week from my team \[about shoplifting and violent incidents\] that I used to get in six months,” he says. He ticks off the knife attacks, the abuse, the gas bottles through windows, and says these violent thefts not only cut into profitability but take a terrible toll on his staff who are frightened to come to work. Some can’t come back and others are on long-term “mental distress” leave.

His store managers will regularly call the police, he says, but officers rarely come to the store, unless there is an assault on a staff member. Small supermarkets like FoodWorks can’t afford security guards, weighted shelves, locking gates and clear cupboards with all their beauty products locked away. They are at the mercy of the thieves, with a police force that, Wymer says, rarely turns up to investigate theft. “There’s just got to be some consequences . . . the system is broken.” When the big supermarkets introduce new measures, like trolley locks or gates, there’s an increase in theft in his stores.

He directs AFR Magazine to the IGA at Werribee, in Melbourne’s south-west, to talk to its manager, Leigh Campbell, and duty manager Heather Markovic. “This used to be a nice place to live,” says Campbell. “And now it’s just gone to shit, and there’s a lot of junkies.” What’s changed, they say, is the brazenness of the thieves. Years ago, police used to attend every shoplifting incident. Now, it’s only if there’s violence. Back in the day, they say, if they approached a shoplifter, the person would shamefully hand over the stolen goods and leave. Now, they tell the staff to “f--- off” and walk out with a trolley full of goods, knowing the staff are trained not to intervene and police will not attend.

In a besser-brick office out the back of the store, Markovic pulls up a video of one of their regular thieves. He’s a big, solid man who heads straight to the store’s bottle shop, where he puts a six-pack of beer in a cloth shopping bag. He grabs another beer off the shelf and opens it. The man wanders out past the checkout, sipping on the beer. An employee behind the counter says something, and the man stops, takes a swig from the can and then raises it towards the employee, as if to say “cheers”. He casually strolls out through the front door with a free beer in one hand and stolen six-pack in the other.

So how do retailers change the equation to increase the risks and lower the rewards for brazen crooks? South Australia and Western Australia are preparing to adopt the ACT’s system of “workplace protection orders” which ban repeat offenders from stores in a manner that’s akin to personal safety intervention orders that protect victims of family violence. Retailers in the ACT can gather evidence such as staff and witness statements as well as security camera footage and apply to a magistrate for an order banning someone from their store for 12 months. If granted, the order is served by police on the offender and if they come to the relevant store they can be arrested on the spot.

Woolworths has applied for 14 workplace orders in the ACT since February 2024 and said it had recorded a 99.6 per cent reduction in reoffending. Overall crime at Woolworths’ stores in the ACT fell 23 per cent compared to last year. NSW Premier Chris Minns has said he’s looking closely as the ACT laws. Victoria, however, has refused to adopt them.

Retailers are also clamouring for facial recognition technology (FRT), to identify professional thieves as soon as they enter their stores. Chris Rodwell, CEO of the Australian Retailers Association, says it is vital that regulators work with retailers to responsibly deploy FRT to protect frontline workers and customers from violence and abuse. The retailers point to a 2024 trial in New Zealand where, in 25 supermarkets over six months, FRT was used to identify repeat offenders.

The trial was overseen by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, which reported that the technology reduced “serious harmful behaviours” by 16 per cent, and led to a 21 per cent reduction in shoplifting. But the NZ privacy commission, as might be expected, does not see FRT as a silver bullet. “It is hard to overstate the privacy implications of a technology that, if widely deployed in supermarkets, would capture images and process the faces of millions of New Zealanders going about their daily lives,” its report said. “The risks of overcollection, scope creep, surveillance, misidentification and bias are well documented.”

Cameras above Woolworths’ self-checkouts. The company reported a 26 per cent rise in violent incidents at its supermarkets in the past year, many related to shoplifting and some involving knives. 

In Australia, both Bunnings and Kmart have been sanctioned by the nation’s privacy commissioner for illegally capturing the biometric details of “hundreds of thousands of individuals” in their stores through FRT and were ordered to cease the practice. Bunnings is appealing against the finding. “It’s time for stronger protections and smart technology, like the responsible use of FRT, to keep people safe,” says managing director Schneider. Swindells, from Coles, says he would take facial recognition technology if it was available, but that it’s “not in my top 10 priorities” because the technology “doesn’t replace a trusted legal system and a supported police force”.

Should we allow for all of us to be surveilled whenever we’re out at the shops? “The use of facial recognition in public spaces is a pretty significant change in the way that our society has been run,” says Carly Kind, the privacy commissioner. “The current law sets quite a high bar for using technologies like this, and in my view for good reason. If the bar is going to be lowered, it should be through legislation and a proper democratic process.”

When we ask Steve to show us his old shoplifting box, he says he doesn’t know where it is. “I think Mum chucked it out,” he says. He’s no longer in the game, having eventually gotten into a rehab program and gotten off heroin (as well as quitting the pokies). “I’d just thought that that was my life, that I was a crim,” he says. “It’s still really hard, but I’m not an addict now. I can save money and I can do things with it,” he says. “They need more rehabs instead of more jails. Jail is f---ing terrible.” There will be fewer shoplifters, Steve reckons, if there are more off-ramps for people like him seeking help with drug addiction. That said, he agrees with the retail executives that it should be harder to steal.

The states, meanwhile, are beefing up their approach to dealing with organised crime’s fondness for five-finger discounts. In NSW, police have appointed Detective Inspector Phil Hallinan to co-ordinate a “new retail crime strategy” to take on the “co-ordinated groups, the co-ordinated syndicates” that have moved into high-end retail theft and to go after the receivers. “Ten per cent of offenders account for 62 per cent \[of stock losses\],” he says. His unit is concentrating on that 10 per cent.

South Australia, which has the lowest rates of retail theft, has a collaborative body that has digital reporting protocols, and police that are quick to respond and have a dedicated retail crime squad. It also has meaningful punishments for offenders. “It’s proven what works,” Swindells says, approving of the SA approach. Last year, assault, threats and abuse in Coles’ Victorian stores rose 45 per cent. In SA, they fell 13 per cent.

Victoria has passed new bail laws to make it more difficult for repeat offenders, and is increasing penalties for people who abuse retail staff. The decision to lift penalties came after more than 20 major retailers co-signed a letter to Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan in late August, warning that urgent reform was needed to address the growing impact of retail crime on the state.

Victoria Police declined a number of requests to interview Chief Commissioner Mike Bush, or other senior officers overseeing retail crime. Police Minister Anthony Carbines initially agreed to a request for an interview, but then his staff cancelled and said we’d have to submit questions in writing. When we did, the minister would not address questions about why things were so bad in Victoria.

According to Swindells, Victoria has the most questions to answer. “The process for us to report crime in Vic is so antiquated,” he says. “A store manager has to go to a police station to report retail crime. There’s no IT system. It’s archaic.” And the sentences handed out in Victoria, compared with other states, “are as anemic as it gets” which leads to “the same people just continually performing the same crime without any real consequence”.

He doesn’t believe Victoria is doing enough to punish offenders or to support its police, and that theft is getting worse. “We’re becoming the crime state of the nation . . . I’m passionate about this because it’s my team members in stores and I want to keep them safe,” Swindells says. “I’m also a dad with two boys who work in Coles. They’ve rung me because things have happened in the store that should never happen. It is unacceptable.”",6,1762138062.0,aussie,6,1.0,False

I ranked Alkemia with a few other people as well, so I'll provide multiple inputs! **I will put it in my order but add an \*asterisk\* if there was disagreement or if it is not my taste but has potential.** I am not reviewing how they smell on me, just in the bottle. I will also edit it if some improve with time. Google also was crashing so I kept having to rewrite these ....

I'm looking for a petrichor scent, so reccomendations are appreciated! I describe my petrichor taste when reviewing Tempestarii. I like musky, rich, and woody scents. Also more foresty, amber, or incense smells. I like some gourmands but generally do not like scents like  chocolate, popcorn, caramel or other very food reminiscent scents. I do not like florals, but my friends do, so I'll show their input.

**Alkemia** (intro set) - Silken tent, gothique, elixir of aphrodite, arabesque, enigma, moss maiden, lilacs along the winding drive, luminae, cherries of the night

Free samples: afterglow, fallen snow angels

**Demeter** \- thunderstorm 

**Andromeda's Curse** \- Firefly Hollow, the tower, wyvern, tempestarii, sea of trees, the magician, death, blood moon, neptune, venus

This list is in order from most liked to least liked.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***WOW that is amazing***

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. **Silken tent - Alkemia**

If you have ever smelled Amika Perk Up Dry Shampoo, it is so similar to this perfume, just minus the typical dry shampoo smell. If you haven't smelled that, this is honestly one of the harder ones to describe. I think it is just a scent everybody could love, super inoffensive. It is the fragrance of a pretty girl walking by, and you double-take to ask, ""What is that perfume?"" It is welcoming and pretty/gorgeous, not sexy/cute. It is so rich in a caramel type of way, layered with mild spices. There is one note I am struggling with; it is almost between a floral and peach smell, and it just adds a more delicate note into the rich caramel.

2) **Firefly Hollow - Andromeda's curse**

It is just so nostalgic to camping. It isn't the stereotypical scent of a raging campfire; however, it is still a camp air scent, like a while after the campfire has gone out, but without the smoky note. It smells like you are surrounded by pine trees with the crisp-aired starry night that comes with the end of the campfire. There is also a kind of smell that reminds me of walking into a Lush store—not super strong, but it is noticeable. This scent will probably go lower in rank because as it sits it is leaning to be a more Lush bathbombs type of scent. :(

3) **Gothique - Alkemia\***

I personally really like the incensy nature of this but could see people disagreeing; nobody in the group hated this scent, but it wasn't as favored for them as it was for me. This one is harder to describe. I would describe it as entering a fortune teller's tent who is definitely a maximalist and has an eye for unique items. Alternatively, a flea market where each shop is close to the other and connected by draped cloth roofs with a brick floor; it is a very maximalist scent, which feels cozy (in an incense way) and small.

4) **Elixir of Aphrodite - Alkemia**

PEACHES. Really gorgeous peaches. It is summer, and you just had the juiciest peach ever. It lies in between a real and fake peach smell but leans way more realistic, just with a little exaggeration, which I personally think is a perfect blend. There is also a slight bubblegum scent at the base while the peach is hovering on top. The website does say it is an apricot scent, but I could see it interpreted as peach or apricot. I think overall it gives the vibe of juicy fruit in general, not even just limited to peach. If this helps, the closest scent I have to Elixir of Aphrodite is Skylar's Peach Fields which smells a lot more like peach leaves of sorts and the atmosphere around and is definitely more of an artificial peach—I prefer Alkemia's.

5) **Sea of Trees - Andromeda's Curse**

It is a very soft-wood scent. It is like walking into a green grassy field surrounded by tall, white, skinny trees. You can smell every single plant and each leaf. It is spring, and although the sky is blue the shade from the leaves leads it to be a darker but still light atmosphere. Since the circle of trees surrounds you and the leaves cover the sky, it leads you to feel like you are in a small area in the forest that is all yours. It feels personal and like you are by yourself but satisfied. It has a water-like feel; it hasn't just rained, but the forest is so lush that it has retained water, and the grass is therefore cold and fluffy.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***I like these perfumes***

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

6) **Fallen Snow Angels - Alkemia**

I actually really quite like this one; it is definitely a seasonal winter scent. It could be worn at different times if you really wanted to, though. It does smell like thin mints to me, which could be positive or negative, to be honest. It is also like peppermint gum with chocolate way in the distance. It is very peppermint-based, but there are accents, which keep the scent unique and fun. Overall, it is a solid winter scent but not my personal choice for an everyday scent.

7) **Moss maiden - Alkemia \***

It captures the spicy sweetness of damp moss and soil perfectly. It is like walking into a green mossy forest where the sky is blocked by tall tree's leaves and the damp mulch + moss squishes as you walk on it. Some trees are collapsed and have became damp and have already started decaying back into the earth. Achieves what it is supposed to perfectly with no weird scents! Another person I smelled this with was obsessed, it genuinely captures the damp, mossy, woodsy, forest so well, highly reccomend! It isn't higher because it isn't my dream scent but for what it is it is perfect.

8) **Wyvern - Andromeda's Curse**

A subtle, but elegant/sexy scent. The base is black pepper which gives it a slightly spicy base. Getting a little massage oil smell but it isnt too overpowering and I can smell the incense as well. It smells like whatever a female wyvern would smell like, this one is spot on to how it is described so there isn't much to add!

9)??? **Arabesque - Alkemia \***

Hands down the most confusing scent ever. Initial smell was just so sweet I hated it, then second smell I fell in love. I hate sweet scents but I was intrigued by the sweet wood type of scent. I honestly could rank this anywhere beacuse I don't really know what is going on. To me it smells like sweet wood and licorice and I really dig it but the sweetness can be weird and I do not think it is a wearble scent. I think this is one of the most unique scents and is a rarer scent to find.

10) **Tempestarii - Andromeda's Curse**

This scent definitely achieves wet grass. It is like sitting in the hot sun in the grass at a summer camp. The grass was watered hours before by the sprinklers and it is just barely damp. I could see it faintly smelling like rain in the summer but the petrichor notes aren't that strong so it falls to smell more like sprinklers than actual rain. It overall suprised me of how green and summerish the scent was. I prefer petrichor scents which are based on the crisp atmosphere of the rainy air and maybe even the smell of rain hitting the concrete, this is quite the opposite so I therefore did not care for it as much.

11) **The Magician - Andromeda's Curse**

Saunf candy. Which is basically sugar-coated fennel seeds + fennel seeds. It is at Indian restaurants a lot, and that is exactly what it smells like to me. Smells great, but it just depends if you like fennel or not!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***Scents I don't hate but don't love***

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

12) **Blood moon - Andromeda's Curse**

I probably ranked this higher than I should I have because it smells like old roses that haven't fully rotted but are getting there and it has a spiciness that burns the nose like smelling a lot of bug-spray does. I just love how unique it is and I know somebody could pull this off.

13) **Afterglow- Alkemia \***

This smells like how just getting a massage smells like. The faint spiciness and rose, the oils, and a lotion type of smell, it is literally identical. It isn't a bad scent but it is kind of a weird scent to wear out because of its resemblance with spa scents. It could probably be achieved using stuff good for your skin which would last longer and be good for you as well so I think it is redundant.

14) **Thunderstorm - Demeter\***

Didn't really know where to place this one, to be honest, because it smells like freshly sprinkled grass and just raw DIRT. However, not in a positive way; it's kind of just an odd scent that is interesting to smell but not really wearable. I like scents that are dirty, but this is just almost too realistic to be worn. It doesn't smell like petrichor at all to me, however, which brought it back a little more. It is over Baie 19 because it is closer to achieving what it advertises since it does achieve earthy notes, and you can smell the water droplets on the grass. It also layers suprisingly well, not sure why, so it is useful for that.

15) **Baie 19 - La Labo**

A solid scent, sure, but I do not get ANY petrichor vibes. To me it is a musky, clean—but not aquatic—scent. Overall, it isn't a special scent for me, and for the hefty price tag it has I don't think it is worth it, but I don't dislike the smell.

16) **The Tower- Andromeda's Curse (S)**

Smells like the waiting room of a darkly lit spa with black walls and hardwood floors. Also I can weirdly imagine a fishtank there, probably the minor aquatic notes, and the uniqueness of the way that fishtanks glow blue and cast that cool shadow. It smells like a modern scent to me and like just a really cool designed spa. It would be higher if there wasn't a sun-screen smelling base.

17) **Death - Andromeda's Curse (S)\***

It doesn't remind me of death but it is a cold, sad scent. It has florals which are a bit weird for me but that is my own preference. Basically it has incense, floral, and tea which comes to form a spicy sad scent. I think it is the coldest, saddest scent which is fitting but the way it is achieved isn't to my taste, for wearability that is also a struggle. Again I do get a little bit of sunscreen which I am not liking.

18) **Neptune- Andromeda's Curse (S)**

It smells like a hotel room, specifically one near the beach, but it doesn't have a salt note or an aquatic one. It is like a linen room spray, which is very light. It does have a slight sunscreen scent, but not nearly as bad as some of the others, and it doesn't clash with the overall vibe of the scent.

19) **Lilacs along the winding drive - Andromeda's Curse\***

I was the odd one out on this one, and I think it is because I do not care for florals. It is like smelling a very strong-smelling lilac, very realistic. I also got a little bubblegum, but it was a minor accompanying scent. It is simple: if you like florals, you will probably like this scent; if you don't, you probably won't. I didn't think it smelled bad by any means; I'm just not a fan of floral. For people who liked florals they ranked this pretty high!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***I don't like***

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

20) **Wheel of Fortune - Andromeda's Curse\***

This is going to be VERY specific; it smells like a christmas candle warmer or a christmas candle. It is the red christmas scents and is not like the evergreen or green scents at all. Specifically a christmas red Yankee Candle, which I do not recall the name of. Nutmeg, vanilla, caramel just really all the christmasy spices I could smell I smelt in this. There is one additional note which smells like a specific Bath & Body Works Wallflower I had when I was younger that I was OBSESSED with. It was a strong, perfumey apple scent. The reason why it is so low is because this scent is everywhere, quite strong, and I don't know how wearable it is. If you like food scents this might actually be pretty enjoyable, though.

21) **Hot Chocolate and Candy Canes - Andromeda's Curse\***

I think it is an inferior version of Fallen Snow Angels. It focuses more on chocolate/coffee (?) notes than mint notes, whilst Fallen Snow Angels focuses on mint. The chocolate scent is definitely artificial. If you prefer a more chocolate-based scent, however, you would probably prefer this one. It is like candy-cane chunks in hot chocolate, very true to its name.

22) **Luminae - Alkemia (S)**

This one's description is the furthest from what I smelled; to me it was quite strong. This is a different variation of Wheel of Fortune, but it lacks the Bath & Body works Wallflower note, so it is more one-dimensional. I do think this scent is going to change over time, though; I already smell a small shift to a more vanilla scent and even, concerningly, a bit more sunscreeny.

23) **Enigma - Alkemia**

I personally just smell straight Elmer's glue it even captures the slight sourness that glue has. Besides that it is just a generic masculine scent. Not everybody smelled the glue but even if they didn't it wasn't rated highly it is just a weird scent and not in a good way.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***No.***

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

24) **Venus - Andromeda's Curse\* (S)**

This smells like nacho cheese to me. it just has a weird saltiness to me. I also smelled strong sunscreen which makes it smell like an amusement park, but in a weird way that isn't positive. I showed it to one other person, and they didn't get that, but even so, they didn't like the smell.

25) **Cherries of the Night - Andromeda's Curse\***

This smells like cherry medicine and honestly makes me sick when I smell it. It is such a medicinal syrupy cherry and makes me gag when I smell it. I love cherry scents usually but this was rough. Everyone agreed except one person who actually ranked this more in the mid ranks and I have no clue why.

It'll work in any case.

Also I relieved the choil and spine (just at the grip area) on my Victorinox cleaver the other day and it blew my mind so I decided to do several of my other knives the same. I used 80 grit sandpaper to do the dirty work and then progressed 220, 400, 1000. I went to 4000 for the Kamo and K&S because I've heard finer polish is less prone to rust. Sorry for the inconsistent lighting. It was light when I started and my kitchen lighting sucks so after I was done the pics aren't as good.

Being bad at flirting is one thing, but not being able to be comfortable is much worse.

Despite socalzing often in bars, clubs and coffee shops etc, I still become frozen and look like a deer in headlights whenever I'm around a pretty woman.

I've had many anxiety attacks while in busy nightclubs. At work, I always feel anxious as hell when it's just myself and a pretty woman in an elevator, luckily it doesn't last long.

I know comparing yourself to others is a recipe for disaster, but I've watched my friends date/hookup for years, and I can't help but feel like shit in comparison.

One of my friends (30m) can't keep his lies straight when dealing with his FWB. That sounds like a goddamn headache, but I'm genuinely impressed with how easy he manages to date/hook up.

On the rare occasion that I find myself talking to a pretty women, my mind goes blank and my social skills suddenly disappear.

Due to this, I have no female freinds, meaning that I don't have the room to practice and become desensitised.

It's overall not looking good, and I honestly don't know where to begin.

1on0cjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1on0cjv/hr_neon_seduction/,[HR] Neon Seduction,"The night was a drab one. The rain pitter-pattered on the asphalt, greasing the ground. Its smooth surface reflected the luminescent lights of the street. Cars flew past, the water parting on the street.The streets were sparsely populated, drifters and drunks stumbled about. Periodically a woman of the night would stroll down. Each straggler sat or walked under the great neon sign. The red saturated light glowed on the skin of all. Its round elaborate patterns seducing bystanders, a lotus flower luring in the innocent. Vagrants and degenerates alike gathered here. Whether to drown the sorrows of the world out or to explore their primal desires. All needs were exploited by the neon sign.

Off to the side of the local watering hole, in the parking lot, sat the hunter and its prey. Eyes followed every movement of the target, examining each step from the brushing of their hair to stepping out of their orange convertible. Silently the stalker sat, waiting until the black industrial door shut behind them, sealing their prey’s fate.  
  
In the blood red convertible across the lot sat the stalker, their mind ran over the steps they so carefully thought of. The poison, the interaction, the witnesses, every piece had to be in their place at the right time. This was of no concern to the chasseur, maybe if this was their first time the mind would race and beads of sweat would appear on the palms. This, however, was far from their first time, many before had fallen into their web. Their soul lifted from this earth, their body given a new purpose.  
  
After a long and well deserved cigarette, the hunter decided to move into the bar. Walking up the red neon sign glowed, staring at the heedless killer. The glass tube working outlined the shape of a beautiful showgirl, her breasts round and perky like a mountain. Beside it the glass calligraphy spelt out the name of the establishment, “The Siren’s Song”.  
  
The metal creaked open but no one heard or saw the predator enter, their ears could hear but their eyes chose not to look. Couples surrounded the bar kissing sloppily, saliva dripping off the corners of their mouth. Men gathered near their short term lovers, awkwardly grinding and dry humping their legs.   
  
Some though sat alone, their concerns left at the door replaced with cheap ecstasy. The prey lay among that row of men. Thoughtless and ignorant to the world around him. While he had money to buy that nice convertible sitting out back, he was so pompous and brash no one ever wanted to even talk to him for a second. This unintentional self induced loneliness led him to fill the infinite hole with booze.  
  
Every night around 9:30 pm, the prey drove his stumpy figure over to any bar that let him. He ordered a bourbon on the rocks then flirted with anything that had a nice pair of legs. He would do this until he was kicked out of the bar, all to repeat it again the next night. Sometimes a bar would let this go on for a while, but nowhere was permanent.  Our hunter was also wary of this information after spotting the ogre like oaf on another one of their outings. Their loud mouth and unfavorable attitude made them a blip on their radar. Causing their every movement to be watched, given the spare time, for 2 weeks. Their patterns became the hunter's,and slowly they encroached onto their own grave.   
  
The hunter grew ever more concerned with this one. Every movement or touch could set him off or cause a scene. If too many eyes latch on they become anomalies, making the risk ever higher. This though, didn’t upset or deter the hunter from their prey. No, their own selfish desire, one similar to their prey’s, only grew with the ever prevalent risk. It made them crave him harder. Dream of his life squeezing out his eyes. Their desire to murder him grew so great that violent dreams would pop up at work.  
  
Now though their ugly present sat slobbishly on a stool, only a few feet in front of them. They grew closer, keeping their growing excitement invisible on their emotionless face. No one paid much attention to the hunter either, as according to the plan. Their red clothes blending into the background, a blur to the breathing crowd. Finally though after chasing their prize, dreaming of it, and craving it, it sat right in front of them. Rolls of fat piled onto each other like a human slug.  
  
His bald spot gleamed in the bar's dim overhead lighting. His skin was a consistent pinkish red, as if his body was working double time.A gold watch clung to his wrist, paired with two gold chains on his melting neck.  As the cherry on top he wore a black track suit, looking like a forgotten member of the Italian mafia.

“Is this seat taken?” the hunter said seductively. The prey moved their large orbs staring at her breasts immediately. “All yours honey.” The hunter smiled delightfully back, holding vomit in the pit of her throat. 

“What’s your name sweetheart?” The hunter gave a stand-in name for the night. “Bianca.”   
  
“Ain’t you just beautiful Bianca.” she giggled with a forced laugh. Anyone could smell out the insincerity in her laugh, but this drunken idiot couldn’t decipher it. “Aren’t you just the sweetest, what’s your name baby?” By the time the hunter sat in her seat she already had the prey in her pretty little hooks. 

“The names Tony, hon,” He picked her hand up and kissed her pale skin,” anyone get you a drink yet?” 

“No not yet, but a cosmopolitan would be nice.” 

“Then a cosmopolitan you shall get,” the prey lifted their hand sloppily in the air trying to get the attention of the bartender. Flags flew up in the predator’s head, she wanted to keep this unsavory interaction on the down low. Even an underpaid bartender may be the determinant of her night out. 

Quickly she thought of an excuse before the tired worker came over,”I need to use the ladies room real quick.” The heaving hog stared at her irritation twitching in his eyes, in a slurry of drawn out words he replied,”alright, just be quick, I did buy you a damn drink.”  
  
“Oh don’t worry baby, I’ll be right back,” her pouty voice calmed the situation down, like a mother taking care of a tubby toddler.  
  
Like that, before the bartender came to take their order, she disappeared. Sliding into the bathroom without making a sound. She stood in front of the mirror standing in between a woman doing lines and one doing their make up. She fixed her hair and reapplied parts of her makeup that started to wear away. Sneakily she slid a hand into her coat pocket grabbing a clear bottle. This little vial of liquid with a convenient dropper on top contained a serum, a serum powerful enough to knock out any large land mammal. 

All she needed was a single drop, enough to slowly activate later when no one was near. When she had him at his most vulnerable.

“OOO Goddamn!”, the woman to her left raised her head, rubbing her nose. In the background you could hear Nancy Reagan on the news, spewing about her war on drugs. The woman continued,”stupid bitch, can't stop me from powdering my nose.” This was met with silence, with the hunter and the other woman just glancing at the poor addict.

“Well I better get out there,” she grabbed her purse and still sniffed obnoxiously,""wouldn't want to keep them waiting, you girls have a fun night.” As she walked out, each step almost seemed to scream confidence, she walked as if she ruled the world. The hunter looked at her with pitiful disgust, to her this woman was only a pawn to the pig headed men that waited outside. Waiting to get home to drunkenly ravage her body for their own fulfillment, not caring for her own pleasure. Instead of taking power for herself, the woman drowned in substances that clouded her true thoughts. The narcotics numbed her into an obedient servant.

After the hunter did her makeup though she sat in the stall and lit up. She enjoyed her cigarette, finding it as a good motivator to finish her duty. She smoked half and flushed the rest down the toilet. 

She walked out the bathroom as more women  flooded to use their sinks as powder stations, finding herself back in the main room of the bar. She headed back to her ruse of a date. Walking up she saw the coked up broad from the bathroom, being fondled from some random man. His hands violated every inch of her body, snakes creeping lower and lower.

“Glad to see you didn’t get stuck in the toilet,” Tony let out a haughty chuckle,” was about to go check on you.” The hunter giggled feeding into the prey’s desires. “Well sometimes a lady needs to re-adjust herself, men just don’t understand.” He pointed his sausage-like appendage at her,”that’s cause men don’t concern themselves with needless things.” She held a reaction of disgust, wanting to yell that an oaf like him should concern himself with his appearance more.

They sat for what was like hours, in reality it had been 10-20 minutes. The hunter continued the facade, giggling at every remark and just nodding her head. Tony kept babbling on, taking the opportunity to even talk to a beautiful woman. He rambled on and on about his political beliefs, commented on her body, and his children’s accomplishments. Most of these children hadn’t conversed with their father in many years, making him only bitter with time.

In the midst of this great trauma dump, not once did he ever ask a question about the lady herself. The hunter noticed this as well, only making her craving ever more dire.  She sat unstable, like a kettle blowing steam. 

She thought her temper couldn’t be handled, it felt as though doing this over and over only led her to become more malice. That she was only filling herself with more pointless hate. Each one and every one of her prey seemed to be getting worse as she moved along. Each one being more vile, more grimy and sweaty. It felt like the men she hunted grew farther from the idiotic bear. The men she hunted seemed to grow more fat and slimy, like an overgrown slug.

Right as the top of her head was about to blow  off, Tony stopped himself. “ I need to fucking piss.” The hunter just nodded her head and smiled as she had before. Tony almost fell off the stool trying to move his disproportionate body. He drunkenly stepped, grabbing the hunter by her shoulder.

“Don’t you go anywhere b..aby,” his tongue tripped on each syllable slurring every consonance that came out.”

“With pleasure honey,” she smiled with the most genuine toothy grin in her entire life. He patted her dainty shoulder,”Good girl.”

She watched as the slimy man slithered away. Slowly approaching the men’s latrine. He stumbled about like a newborn, grabbing random civilian’s chairs to stabilize himself. Glares from bar goers glued onto Tony, but of course he was too intoxicated to notice anything. 

As soon as that door closed, the hunter got straight to preparing her trap. Slyly she reached into her red coat, pulling out her special serum. A slow acting drug that will put her prey under while she transported his gargantuan body. She uncapped the top, only putting a single drop in his glass of bourbon.

The hunter looked around, looking for any witnesses to her empowering action. To her relief all of those around were focused either on their drink or date. Even if anyone saw her movement, no one would think much of it. Her small stature and the organ that sits between her legs makes it easy to catch her prey. They underestimate the hunter, believing she is weak. There is nothing weak though with the hunter, weakness is only a perception. With that false representation, lies a deadly consequence.

Suddenly she was reminded of her goal as  a belch broke her thoughts. The slob moved back over to his stool. The hunter put back on her fleshy mask. She told herself that this will soon be in her control, trying to keep her attitude positive.

“I never should’ve broken the damn seal,” each word combined with a grunt as he sat down. His hand reached for the glass. The hunter’s eyes widened as the prey’s meaty paw grasped the cool cup. 

Time seemed to grow slower and slower, becoming more viscous as it went along. The brown glossy liquid trickled down, entering his thick bull neck. The hunter held back a gasp of excitement. For the first time, Tony was found attractive in the eyes of the predator. As he drank the spiked drink, his features decayed before the hunter. His eyes fell out and skin began to peel. Flies stuck to his ajar mouth. Excitement blossomed, Tony was growing closer and closer to her image. Beauty born out of rot.

His drink was dry, and his stupor enhanced. The hunter took advantage of this as soon as she could.

“Why not leave this place and go somewhere, say, more personal?” She fluttered her eyes trying to seduce the prey out of safety. Tony grabbed her ass and burrowed his brown eyes into her’s,”Mmm, nothing I would like more.” She forced the instinctual bile back down, continuing on her performance. “Why not my place,” she held back laughter as the irony hit,”let me treat you baby.” Tony chuckled,”Shit sounds good with me, as long as you drive.”

“Planned on it,” the hunter muttered to herself.”Huh?” her eyes met his,”Oh nothing, just head to my car, it's the red convertible.” The prey slapped a couple dollar bills on the bar and nodded agreeingly,""With pleasure!”

As Tony stumbled out, the red lady watched. Now the excitement dug under her skin, he had so perfectly fell into her trap. This transition of power that she so ever craved had been fulfilled again. 

Quickly she shifted out of the Siren’s Song, heading to her makeshift hearse. The blood red car sat there in the asphalt bed. Its headlights staring at their master, waiting to transport the live corpse.This car was a part of the hunter. Ever since her first victim in the mid 70’s, the car was there. It transported the butchered to their end, acting like Chiron , transporting the dead across the Styx.

She opened the door where Tony sat. He was half asleep and grumbled inconsistent vowels and random sounds. He beckoned to the hunter and asked her, “Give me a kiss baby.” She bent over, starting to kiss the prey keeping him calm as she waited for the serum to set in. He sloppily smacked his lips upon hers, acting like he was trying to eat her face off. She kissed back unwillingly, vomit waiting for the go ahead to be released. Tingles ran through her, as if her body rejected his very presence.

Luckily though his mouth started to move slower and slower. His tongue stopped trying to barge its way down the hunter’s throat. His lips kissed ever so slowly, as if the batteries in his body had been dying. Finally Tony sat there, motionless and frozen in a pathetic fetal position.

The hunter spat on the sad excuse for a man and started her car. With blissful silence, it pulled out the bar’s parking lot and headed down the street. The hunter sat in darkness as she carried the ignorant pig. The occasional street light shined on her pale skin, her dark eyes scanning the vacant streets. 

Her body eased up and her muscles relaxed, she sat back and enjoyed the quiet ride. The shameless hooker or the weary drugged out homeless man suspected nothing. The car just strolled right along. Even if the straggling lonesome cop pulled her over, the charisma of the hunter could pull them out of most situations. 

The car turned onto the hunter’s street, pulling into the empty driveway. She got out and opened her garage door,  driving the car inside. The house was a large one, a dark purple hue covered the wooden walls. It bore two great spires of that of the Victorian age. A great porch spun around the front end of the house, with a long staircase spilling into the yard. The roof was tiled black, adding a final cherry on top to the house's atmosphere. Dogs whimpered as they walked past and children didn't even dare to walk onto its lawn. 

The house was a gift the hunter gave to herself. She was the sole inheritor being an only child making competition low. After her mother had died her father only became more abusive, drinking more and becoming a larger nuisance. Her father only grew on her nerves more and more, she wished to be alone more and more. So one day as her father sat down to drink his morning coffee, unknowingly the hunter laid the trap. After one sip, his heart swelled up, constricting the arteries. As his body squeezed the life from his soul the hunter laughed. The last image he would see was his daughter laughing at his twitching corpse. After the coroner's office declared it a heart attack and the property was hers. The house became her butcher shop ever since that day, and Tony was the next hog lined up for slaughter.

The door flung open to her car, the hunter dragged over the metal cart placing Tony on it. His flabby figure melted on the tray of the trolley. The hunter carted the meat wrapped in a track suit out of the garage. The door to the basement flung open, and carefully, step by step, she hauled the piggy down. She dodged all the objects and got to the Butcher’s room.

In the middle, like an altar at a temple, stood a large metal pole. Adorned on the top of was a cage to hold their large bulbous heads. A lock was attached to the bottom, used to keep their wriggling necks still. Blood covered the pillar like a crimson Dalmatian. The floor below held a splotchy brown pattern, a product of them ever so rudely spilling their bile and blood.

The Hunter prepared her meat for slaughter, stripping the hideous hog. Its pale belly stood out like a white hot cauldron. Bad tan lines, like a tattoo, branded his skin. The hunter gagged the piggy’s mouth,she didn't care too much for their squealing. Finally, whether it be adrenaline or luck, the hunter heaved Tony's body into the pole. She stood him up tall, locking his head in the cage. Chains, as strong as metal pythons, wrapped his wrist binding them together with a metal loop holding it down. The pig had no chance of escape.

The hunter walked to her table, looking over the tools, deciding which was best for tonight. A sewing needle? Perhaps the bowie knife, good for a little carving. Maybe the brutish yet clean meat cleaver? The hunter thought why not all? Hell, after all this stalking and god awful kissing, she thought deserved to have a little fun.

She skipped over, giggling with the smelling salts in her hand. She held them up to the pig’s cage, snapping them in front of their snout. Suddenly eyes burst awake, a groggy demeanor slowly grew into realization and panic.

Grunts tried to run through the cloth but were stopped, only being heard as muffles. The hunter giggled, ”Glad to see you’re awake, I was worried you were going to miss the show.” Her knife gilded across his stretched out skin, cries whimpered pleadingly. 

 ”Not like I was going to let you miss it,” she sighed taking in the horrifically beautiful sight, “it feels so good not hearing you fucking snort in my ear.” Her laughter kept spilling into her words, “I can actually fucking talk!” 

Tony fought his bondage, attempting to curse at the hunter all that he could. Quickly the hunter’s blade made a shallow incision down his stomach. Tony cried louder and louder his gag only doing so much. Spit and tears streamed from orifices in his face. The knife continued, the hunter used the prey as a canvas, her blade as the brush. 

“You all act so tough” The hunted said with revulsion,”until you meet the Butcher.” The hunter backed away, Tony cried as he pulled at the ground in vain. “You aren’t the first little piggy,” the hunter remarked,” and you won’t be the last.” She flipped the light switch, showing a countless amount dolllike corpses. Their eyes gleamed a petrified look of fear. Across their bodies words like whore, slut, and cunt were carved in. Various appendages were replaced with that of a pig, with some having snouts to little curly tails. Their skins sewn tight, like a botched plastic surgery. Some  were even missing arms, legs, feet, and hands.

‘All of them were too ignorant,” the hunter said reminiscently,” it led them right to me, like you little piggy!” She walked back towards the man, standing like a witch in Salem. He closed his eyes and waited for the end.

His screams danced in the vacuum of the concrete. Slow strokes of her steel brush tore through his skin. Satisfaction filling the hunter’s hole. The prey wriggled all that he could in his position, all of it no use. As the torture went on, the seed of hope died in the prey’s heart. He knew his fate. Rather than fight the metal ropes, or try to scream, he reflected. 

In this the prey could only cry, for it was his own actions that ended his life. It was too late though, as the tears of regret wasn’t what the hunter wanted, only his life would satisfy. The hunter continued to pull and chop at her fleshy mannequin, molding it to her desire. She lopped off globs of flesh and sewed pieces of skin tighter in different places. This was all after she skinned it off her mannequin of course. 

By half way through it the prey died, his name destined to be forgotten in the sea of missing people. The hunter was sad when he died remarking,” Gone so soon little pig?”. She continued to work though, turning him into one of her finest dolls. She gleamed over his corpse, basking in the result of her mundane stalking.

She would play with this doll for a long time, longer than any before it. Just like all the others before, he eventually got thrown into the ground as space became tight. His body decomposed into the earth, only becoming a pile of rotting bones. 

The hunter though would continue her endless cycle of violent gratification, the neon sign leading more pigs into the Butcher’s room. Time though would creep unknowingly, aging the hunter until she could no longer stalk her prey efficiently. She would live her last days among her work. This didn’t help the hunter, only making her more bitter. She’d lock herself up in her house, sealing her in the wooden tomb. She would die from the lack of purpose she found in her age. Lying lonely with her dolls, a furrowed look of anger carved into her face.

In the following years, her crimes would be found. New articles blasted the hunter’s name to the whole world. Her work was viewed all over the globe, enduring many to watch. The true number of victims was never found and her name would become that of a folktale. The effects though would fail to teach the oblivious crowds, and the neon sign would continue to glow.",2,1762137395.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I'm from an orthodox family back in India. My parents had already advised me to not to get into any relationships/flings during my stay in USA. I never had any relationships in India also.

But as a guy, I do feel attracted to white girls here. I don't dislike or hate my own race or anything, but maybe due to watching a lot of Hollywood movies and being exposed to white women here, I kind of like them and find them sexually attractive. So, I asked out a few white girls who I liked, but got rejected. I felt very bad and depressed. It even affected my studies.

God seemed to have other plans. A black girl from my university approached me for a date. Not out of the random, as we had some classes together. So we went for a coffee date. She's from Illinois. I learnt a lot of things about her place and stuff to impress her, and she too was impressed.

She's cute, intelligent, and all. But in my mind a black girl felt like a downgrade. I'm sorry this sounds racist and harsh, but I am just being honest. I wanted a white girlfriend. So, I've been telling myself that I'm being a prick. Why can't I just be happy with what God gave me?

Honestly, she's a nice girl. Very well educated. She's funny and witty. But it's just that in my mind, it feels like a downgrade when I wanted a white girlfriend in the first place.

I know I'm being racist. I don't want to be like this. I need advice on how to overcome these racist thoughts, and accept this woman for what she is and not judge her based on her skin colour.",0,1762137275.0,dating_advice,10,0.38,False

The kind that starts with good conversation, some sarcastic banter, shared playlists, and late-night chats that feel easy and warm. The kind that doesn’t fade once the novelty wears off.

I really value humor, patience, and that quiet kind of chemistry that sneaks up on you. The moment you catch yourself smiling and thinking, yeah, this feels right.

I’m not in a rush. I just want something genuine that unfolds naturally, with warmth, wit, and a little bit of mischief.

If you’re also someone who prefers things that grow over time, maybe we’ll get along just fine.

We love:
☕️ Coffee farm experiences
🌋 Scenic nature + light/medium hiking
🧘🏻‍♀️ Yoga / wellness
✨ Romantic / honeymoon vibes
🐒 Wildlife
🛁 Chill luxury time (spa, hot springs, private dinners, etc.)

Here’s our itinerary:
	•	Papagayo (Waldorf Astoria) – 5 nights
	•	La Fortuna (Nayara Tented Camp) – 5 nights
	•	Perez Zeledón / Hacienda AltaGracia – 4 nights

We definitely want at least one coffee experience + some light hiking in each region, but also don’t want to over-schedule — we want time to just enjoy the resorts and each other 💕

What’s one standout, must-do activity in each area?
Could be adventure, spa, nature, romantic dinner, wildlife tours — whatever feels iconic to you for that part of Costa Rica.

Also open to any local experiences or smaller boutique coffee farms vs big tours!

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me.

I am an English guy

So firstly I’m not conservative and I’m not from the USA anyway and I am not religious the way I am is my own personal choice and how I have wanted to live my Life. I’m not intending to offend anyone at all I would ask those to be respectful towards me don’t report this post if you don’t like it im a very decent man I know what I want in life and I want to find a decent woman! If I don’t appeal to you please just move on!

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents!

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 35 hanks and please don't be shy to send me a message

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps.

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine.

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy.

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class. 

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one.

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life.

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do.

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling.

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful.

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that.

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible.

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way. 

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving.

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive.

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment. I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural.

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it.

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on.

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it.

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv.

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly not showing too much off with revealing clothing. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy.

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1on075b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1on075b/neon_seduction/,Neon Seduction,"The night was a drab one. The rain pitter-pattered on the asphalt, greasing the ground. Its smooth surface reflected the luminescent lights of the street. Cars flew past, the water parting on the street.The streets were sparsely populated, drifters and drunks stumbled about. Periodically a woman of the night would stroll down. Each straggler sat or walked under the great neon sign. The red saturated light glowed on the skin of all. Its round elaborate patterns seducing bystanders, a lotus flower luring in the innocent. Vagrants and degenerates alike gathered here. Whether to drown the sorrows of the world out or to explore their primal desires. All needs were exploited by the neon sign.

Off to the side of the local watering hole, in the parking lot, sat the hunter and its prey. Eyes followed every movement of the target, examining each step from the brushing of their hair to stepping out of their orange convertible. Silently the stalker sat, waiting until the black industrial door shut behind them, sealing their prey’s fate.  
  
In the blood red convertible across the lot sat the stalker, their mind ran over the steps they so carefully thought of. The poison, the interaction, the witnesses, every piece had to be in their place at the right time. This was of no concern to the chasseur, maybe if this was their first time the mind would race and beads of sweat would appear on the palms. This, however, was far from their first time, many before had fallen into their web. Their soul lifted from this earth, their body given a new purpose.  
  
After a long and well deserved cigarette, the hunter decided to move into the bar. Walking up the red neon sign glowed, staring at the heedless killer. The glass tube working outlined the shape of a beautiful showgirl, her breasts round and perky like a mountain. Beside it the glass calligraphy spelt out the name of the establishment, “The Siren’s Song”.  
  
The metal creaked open but no one heard or saw the predator enter, their ears could hear but their eyes chose not to look. Couples surrounded the bar kissing sloppily, saliva dripping off the corners of their mouth. Men gathered near their short term lovers, awkwardly grinding and dry humping their legs.   
  
Some though sat alone, their concerns left at the door replaced with cheap ecstasy. The prey lay among that row of men. Thoughtless and ignorant to the world around him. While he had money to buy that nice convertible sitting out back, he was so pompous and brash no one ever wanted to even talk to him for a second. This unintentional self induced loneliness led him to fill the infinite hole with booze.  
  
Every night around 9:30 pm, the prey drove his stumpy figure over to any bar that let him. He ordered a bourbon on the rocks then flirted with anything that had a nice pair of legs. He would do this until he was kicked out of the bar, all to repeat it again the next night. Sometimes a bar would let this go on for a while, but nowhere was permanent.  Our hunter was also wary of this information after spotting the ogre like oaf on another one of their outings. Their loud mouth and unfavorable attitude made them a blip on their radar. Causing their every movement to be watched, given the spare time, for 2 weeks. Their patterns became the hunter's,and slowly they encroached onto their own grave.   
  
The hunter grew ever more concerned with this one. Every movement or touch could set him off or cause a scene. If too many eyes latch on they become anomalies, making the risk ever higher. This though, didn’t upset or deter the hunter from their prey. No, their own selfish desire, one similar to their prey’s, only grew with the ever prevalent risk. It made them crave him harder. Dream of his life squeezing out his eyes. Their desire to murder him grew so great that violent dreams would pop up at work.  
  
Now though their ugly present sat slobbishly on a stool, only a few feet in front of them. They grew closer, keeping their growing excitement invisible on their emotionless face. No one paid much attention to the hunter either, as according to the plan. Their red clothes blending into the background, a blur to the breathing crowd. Finally though after chasing their prize, dreaming of it, and craving it, it sat right in front of them. Rolls of fat piled onto each other like a human slug.  
  
His bald spot gleamed in the bar's dim overhead lighting. His skin was a consistent pinkish red, as if his body was working double time.A gold watch clung to his wrist, paired with two gold chains on his melting neck.  As the cherry on top he wore a black track suit, looking like a forgotten member of the Italian mafia.

“Is this seat taken?” the hunter said seductively. The prey moved their large orbs staring at her breasts immediately. “All yours honey.” The hunter smiled delightfully back, holding vomit in the pit of her throat. 

“What’s your name sweetheart?” The hunter gave a stand-in name for the night. “Bianca.”   
  
“Ain’t you just beautiful Bianca.” she giggled with a forced laugh. Anyone could smell out the insincerity in her laugh, but this drunken idiot couldn’t decipher it. “Aren’t you just the sweetest, what’s your name baby?” By the time the hunter sat in her seat she already had the prey in her pretty little hooks. 

“The names Tony, hon,” He picked her hand up and kissed her pale skin,” anyone get you a drink yet?” 

“No not yet, but a cosmopolitan would be nice.” 

“Then a cosmopolitan you shall get,” the prey lifted their hand sloppily in the air trying to get the attention of the bartender. Flags flew up in the predator’s head, she wanted to keep this unsavory interaction on the down low. Even an underpaid bartender may be the determinant of her night out. 

Quickly she thought of an excuse before the tired worker came over,”I need to use the ladies room real quick.” The heaving hog stared at her irritation twitching in his eyes, in a slurry of drawn out words he replied,”alright, just be quick, I did buy you a damn drink.”  
  
“Oh don’t worry baby, I’ll be right back,” her pouty voice calmed the situation down, like a mother taking care of a tubby toddler.  
  
Like that, before the bartender came to take their order, she disappeared. Sliding into the bathroom without making a sound. She stood in front of the mirror standing in between a woman doing lines and one doing their make up. She fixed her hair and reapplied parts of her makeup that started to wear away. Sneakily she slid a hand into her coat pocket grabbing a clear bottle. This little vial of liquid with a convenient dropper on top contained a serum, a serum powerful enough to knock out any large land mammal. 

All she needed was a single drop, enough to slowly activate later when no one was near. When she had him at his most vulnerable.

“OOO Goddamn!”, the woman to her left raised her head, rubbing her nose. In the background you could hear Nancy Reagan on the news, spewing about her war on drugs. The woman continued,”stupid bitch, can't stop me from powdering my nose.” This was met with silence, with the hunter and the other woman just glancing at the poor addict.

“Well I better get out there,” she grabbed her purse and still sniffed obnoxiously,""wouldn't want to keep them waiting, you girls have a fun night.” As she walked out, each step almost seemed to scream confidence, she walked as if she ruled the world. The hunter looked at her with pitiful disgust, to her this woman was only a pawn to the pig headed men that waited outside. Waiting to get home to drunkenly ravage her body for their own fulfillment, not caring for her own pleasure. Instead of taking power for herself, the woman drowned in substances that clouded her true thoughts. The narcotics numbed her into an obedient servant.

After the hunter did her makeup though she sat in the stall and lit up. She enjoyed her cigarette, finding it as a good motivator to finish her duty. She smoked half and flushed the rest down the toilet. 

She walked out the bathroom as more women  flooded to use their sinks as powder stations, finding herself back in the main room of the bar. She headed back to her ruse of a date. Walking up she saw the coked up broad from the bathroom, being fondled from some random man. His hands violated every inch of her body, snakes creeping lower and lower.

“Glad to see you didn’t get stuck in the toilet,” Tony let out a haughty chuckle,” was about to go check on you.” The hunter giggled feeding into the prey’s desires. “Well sometimes a lady needs to re-adjust herself, men just don’t understand.” He pointed his sausage-like appendage at her,”that’s cause men don’t concern themselves with needless things.” She held a reaction of disgust, wanting to yell that an oaf like him should concern himself with his appearance more.

They sat for what was like hours, in reality it had been 10-20 minutes. The hunter continued the facade, giggling at every remark and just nodding her head. Tony kept babbling on, taking the opportunity to even talk to a beautiful woman. He rambled on and on about his political beliefs, commented on her body, and his children’s accomplishments. Most of these children hadn’t conversed with their father in many years, making him only bitter with time.

In the midst of this great trauma dump, not once did he ever ask a question about the lady herself. The hunter noticed this as well, only making her craving ever more dire.  She sat unstable, like a kettle blowing steam. 

She thought her temper couldn’t be handled, it felt as though doing this over and over only led her to become more malice. That she was only filling herself with more pointless hate. Each one and every one of her prey seemed to be getting worse as she moved along. Each one being more vile, more grimy and sweaty. It felt like the men she hunted grew farther from the idiotic bear. The men she hunted seemed to grow more fat and slimy, like an overgrown slug.

Right as the top of her head was about to blow  off, Tony stopped himself. “ I need to fucking piss.” The hunter just nodded her head and smiled as she had before. Tony almost fell off the stool trying to move his disproportionate body. He drunkenly stepped, grabbing the hunter by her shoulder.

“Don’t you go anywhere b..aby,” his tongue tripped on each syllable slurring every consonance that came out.”

“With pleasure honey,” she smiled with the most genuine toothy grin in her entire life. He patted her dainty shoulder,”Good girl.”

She watched as the slimy man slithered away. Slowly approaching the men’s latrine. He stumbled about like a newborn, grabbing random civilian’s chairs to stabilize himself. Glares from bar goers glued onto Tony, but of course he was too intoxicated to notice anything. 

As soon as that door closed, the hunter got straight to preparing her trap. Slyly she reached into her red coat, pulling out her special serum. A slow acting drug that will put her prey under while she transported his gargantuan body. She uncapped the top, only putting a single drop in his glass of bourbon.

The hunter looked around, looking for any witnesses to her empowering action. To her relief all of those around were focused either on their drink or date. Even if anyone saw her movement, no one would think much of it. Her small stature and the organ that sits between her legs makes it easy to catch her prey. They underestimate the hunter, believing she is weak. There is nothing weak though with the hunter, weakness is only a perception. With that false representation, lies a deadly consequence.

Suddenly she was reminded of her goal as  a belch broke her thoughts. The slob moved back over to his stool. The hunter put back on her fleshy mask. She told herself that this will soon be in her control, trying to keep her attitude positive.

“I never should’ve broken the damn seal,” each word combined with a grunt as he sat down. His hand reached for the glass. The hunter’s eyes widened as the prey’s meaty paw grasped the cool cup. 

Time seemed to grow slower and slower, becoming more viscous as it went along. The brown glossy liquid trickled down, entering his thick bull neck. The hunter held back a gasp of excitement. For the first time, Tony was found attractive in the eyes of the predator. As he drank the spiked drink, his features decayed before the hunter. His eyes fell out and skin began to peel. Flies stuck to his ajar mouth. Excitement blossomed, Tony was growing closer and closer to her image. Beauty born out of rot.

His drink was dry, and his stupor enhanced. The hunter took advantage of this as soon as she could.

“Why not leave this place and go somewhere, say, more personal?” She fluttered her eyes trying to seduce the prey out of safety. Tony grabbed her ass and burrowed his brown eyes into her’s,”Mmm, nothing I would like more.” She forced the instinctual bile back down, continuing on her performance. “Why not my place,” she held back laughter as the irony hit,”let me treat you baby.” Tony chuckled,”Shit sounds good with me, as long as you drive.”

“Planned on it,” the hunter muttered to herself.”Huh?” her eyes met his,”Oh nothing, just head to my car, it's the red convertible.” The prey slapped a couple dollar bills on the bar and nodded agreeingly,""With pleasure!”

As Tony stumbled out, the red lady watched. Now the excitement dug under her skin, he had so perfectly fell into her trap. This transition of power that she so ever craved had been fulfilled again. 

Quickly she shifted out of the Siren’s Song, heading to her makeshift hearse. The blood red car sat there in the asphalt bed. Its headlights staring at their master, waiting to transport the live corpse.This car was a part of the hunter. Ever since her first victim in the mid 70’s, the car was there. It transported the butchered to their end, acting like Chiron , transporting the dead across the Styx.

She opened the door where Tony sat. He was half asleep and grumbled inconsistent vowels and random sounds. He beckoned to the hunter and asked her, “Give me a kiss baby.” She bent over, starting to kiss the prey keeping him calm as she waited for the serum to set in. He sloppily smacked his lips upon hers, acting like he was trying to eat her face off. She kissed back unwillingly, vomit waiting for the go ahead to be released. Tingles ran through her, as if her body rejected his very presence.

Luckily though his mouth started to move slower and slower. His tongue stopped trying to barge its way down the hunter’s throat. His lips kissed ever so slowly, as if the batteries in his body had been dying. Finally Tony sat there, motionless and frozen in a pathetic fetal position.

The hunter spat on the sad excuse for a man and started her car. With blissful silence, it pulled out the bar’s parking lot and headed down the street. The hunter sat in darkness as she carried the ignorant pig. The occasional street light shined on her pale skin, her dark eyes scanning the vacant streets. 

Her body eased up and her muscles relaxed, she sat back and enjoyed the quiet ride. The shameless hooker or the weary drugged out homeless man suspected nothing. The car just strolled right along. Even if the straggling lonesome cop pulled her over, the charisma of the hunter could pull them out of most situations. 

The car turned onto the hunter’s street, pulling into the empty driveway. She got out and opened her garage door,  driving the car inside. The house was a large one, a dark purple hue covered the wooden walls. It bore two great spires of that of the Victorian age. A great porch spun around the front end of the house, with a long staircase spilling into the yard. The roof was tiled black, adding a final cherry on top to the house's atmosphere. Dogs whimpered as they walked past and children didn't even dare to walk onto its lawn. 

The house was a gift the hunter gave to herself. She was the sole inheritor being an only child making competition low. After her mother had died her father only became more abusive, drinking more and becoming a larger nuisance. Her father only grew on her nerves more and more, she wished to be alone more and more. So one day as her father sat down to drink his morning coffee, unknowingly the hunter laid the trap. After one sip, his heart swelled up, constricting the arteries. As his body squeezed the life from his soul the hunter laughed. The last image he would see was his daughter laughing at his twitching corpse. After the coroner's office declared it a heart attack and the property was hers. The house became her butcher shop ever since that day, and Tony was the next hog lined up for slaughter.

The door flung open to her car, the hunter dragged over the metal cart placing Tony on it. His flabby figure melted on the tray of the trolley. The hunter carted the meat wrapped in a track suit out of the garage. The door to the basement flung open, and carefully, step by step, she hauled the piggy down. She dodged all the objects and got to the Butcher’s room.

In the middle, like an altar at a temple, stood a large metal pole. Adorned on the top of was a cage to hold their large bulbous heads. A lock was attached to the bottom, used to keep their wriggling necks still. Blood covered the pillar like a crimson Dalmatian. The floor below held a splotchy brown pattern, a product of them ever so rudely spilling their bile and blood.

The Hunter prepared her meat for slaughter, stripping the hideous hog. Its pale belly stood out like a white hot cauldron. Bad tan lines, like a tattoo, branded his skin. The hunter gagged the piggy’s mouth,she didn't care too much for their squealing. Finally, whether it be adrenaline or luck, the hunter heaved Tony's body into the pole. She stood him up tall, locking his head in the cage. Chains, as strong as metal pythons, wrapped his wrist binding them together with a metal loop holding it down. The pig had no chance of escape.

The hunter walked to her table, looking over the tools, deciding which was best for tonight. A sewing needle? Perhaps the bowie knife, good for a little carving. Maybe the brutish yet clean meat cleaver? The hunter thought why not all? Hell, after all this stalking and god awful kissing, she thought deserved to have a little fun.

She skipped over, giggling with the smelling salts in her hand. She held them up to the pig’s cage, snapping them in front of their snout. Suddenly eyes burst awake, a groggy demeanor slowly grew into realization and panic.

Grunts tried to run through the cloth but were stopped, only being heard as muffles. The hunter giggled, ”Glad to see you’re awake, I was worried you were going to miss the show.” Her knife gilded across his stretched out skin, cries whimpered pleadingly. 

 ”Not like I was going to let you miss it,” she sighed taking in the horrifically beautiful sight, “it feels so good not hearing you fucking snort in my ear.” Her laughter kept spilling into her words, “I can actually fucking talk!” 

Tony fought his bondage, attempting to curse at the hunter all that he could. Quickly the hunter’s blade made a shallow incision down his stomach. Tony cried louder and louder his gag only doing so much. Spit and tears streamed from orifices in his face. The knife continued, the hunter used the prey as a canvas, her blade as the brush. 

“You all act so tough” The hunted said with revulsion,”until you meet the Butcher.” The hunter backed away, Tony cried as he pulled at the ground in vain. “You aren’t the first little piggy,” the hunter remarked,” and you won’t be the last.” She flipped the light switch, showing a countless amount dolllike corpses. Their eyes gleamed a petrified look of fear. Across their bodies words like whore, slut, and cunt were carved in. Various appendages were replaced with that of a pig, with some having snouts to little curly tails. Their skins sewn tight, like a botched plastic surgery. Some  were even missing arms, legs, feet, and hands.

‘All of them were too ignorant,” the hunter said reminiscently,” it led them right to me, like you little piggy!” She walked back towards the man, standing like a witch in Salem. He closed his eyes and waited for the end.

His screams danced in the vacuum of the concrete. Slow strokes of her steel brush tore through his skin. Satisfaction filling the hunter’s hole. The prey wriggled all that he could in his position, all of it no use. As the torture went on, the seed of hope died in the prey’s heart. He knew his fate. Rather than fight the metal ropes, or try to scream, he reflected. 

In this the prey could only cry, for it was his own actions that ended his life. It was too late though, as the tears of regret wasn’t what the hunter wanted, only his life would satisfy. The hunter continued to pull and chop at her fleshy mannequin, molding it to her desire. She lopped off globs of flesh and sewed pieces of skin tighter in different places. This was all after she skinned it off her mannequin of course. 

By half way through it the prey died, his name destined to be forgotten in the sea of missing people. The hunter was sad when he died remarking,” Gone so soon little pig?”. She continued to work though, turning him into one of her finest dolls. She gleamed over his corpse, basking in the result of her mundane stalking.

She would play with this doll for a long time, longer than any before it. Just like all the others before, he eventually got thrown into the ground as space became tight. His body decomposed into the earth, only becoming a pile of rotting bones. 

The hunter though would continue her endless cycle of violent gratification, the neon sign leading more pigs into the Butcher’s room. Time though would creep unknowingly, aging the hunter until she could no longer stalk her prey efficiently. She would live her last days among her work. This didn’t help the hunter, only making her more bitter. She’d lock herself up in her house, sealing her in the wooden tomb. She would die from the lack of purpose she found in her age. Lying lonely with her dolls, a furrowed look of anger carved into her face.

In the following years, her crimes would be found. New articles blasted the hunter’s name to the whole world. Her work was viewed all over the globe, enduring many to watch. The true number of victims was never found and her name would become that of a folktale. The effects though would fail to teach the oblivious crowds, and the neon sign would continue to glow.",1,1762136965.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

It was around midnight a few years ago when I heard the sound of someone breaking into my house. I don’t think I had more than twenty minutes of sleep but as soon as I heard the window being broken I was wide awake and looking for my phone to call the police. 

My heart sank when I remembered that I left it downstairs, charging in the kitchen. The source of the break in. 

I live alone, had no one as backup and didn't have a gun, so I grabbed the only thing that could pass as a weapon: a baseball bat. Once I had that, I psyched myself up to go downstairs to face the intruder. 

Once I reached the bottom step I saw the silhouette of a man sitting at my kitchen table. It was dark so I could not see what he looked like but the stink coming off him was enough to curl my nose hairs. It was obvious even without the lights on that he was, at best, a drifter and at worst a vagrant. Either way, even a blind man could see that whoever broke into my house fell on hard times. Not that that was going to change my mind about kicking him out of my house. He did break in after all. 

When I turned on the lights I could see that his clothes were old, dirty and torn. It was as though he pulled them out of a dumpster. He was so skinny that I wouldn't be surprised if the man was sick on top of being malnourished. His hair was long and stringy and, just like his beard, it grew in patches. The way he sat there motionless with his thousand yard stare and tears forming in his eyes made me think that he had given up on life. 

I was about to tell him to get out but as soon as I opened my mouth I noticed that he had a shotgun on his lap. 

Upon seeing this I lowered the bat and nervously asked him what he wanted. However he didn’t answer me. Instead, he just sat still and stared straight ahead as if I wasn't even in the room with him. 

Scared, I asked him if he was hungry and that I could make him something. As a kid I was instructed to give the homeless food instead of money since they might buy booze or drugs with it, but the man didn't answer. So after a long awkward silence I took the initiative and went to heat up some leftovers in the microwave. As I was doing this I prodded the stranger with questions, what his name was, what he wanted and if he wanted me to call anyone. 

He did not answer for a long time and hardly noticed the food I placed in front of him once it was ready. However, once he started talking he told me a story that would change my life forever. 

He said his name was Cole Dyer and admitted to killing twenty people. 

I’m not at all embarrassed to say that I cried and begged for my life at this point. This only angered Cole.

“I have something I need to fucking get off my chest. So sit the fuck down and shut up.”

Doing what he said, I sat across from Cole who told me how he got started killing people. His first victim was a hooker who he choked to death when he thought she was stealing from him. With the shotgun in his lap I didn't want to anger him so I just sat there and didn't ask any questions. 

Cole would go on to explain that this victim wasn't killed like the others because, at that time he didn't know how he wanted to murder people, or for that matter, knew that he had a taste for it.

“I figured it would be just a matter of time before some cop showed up at my doorstep or came to my work to ask questions. But after a few weeks of no one coming around and not even a mention in the obituaries, I figured I was in the clear” Cole explained. “It shouldn't be surprising that no one gave a shit about her. If anyone cared for her she wouldnt have been a fucking hooker, you know?”

Finally having a way to vent his frustrations and no longer feeling like some cog in the machine, Cole’s murderous fantasies took on a life of their own. 

“When I tried going after the second person, I tried to strangle her with a piece of guitar string. That was messy and loud and I nearly got caught. Not long after that, maybe five or six people later I came up with my own preferred method of killing people” Cole explained. “I even gave myself a silly name: The ‘Pass It On Killer.’”

It was the first time I spoke in what seemed like an hour. A single word. 

“Why?”

“Why what? The name?” Cole asked but I was too afraid to answer. 

Annoyed with my silence, Cole went ahead and explained his reasoning by justifying his twisted sense of righteousness and questionable moral compass. The gist of it was that if he killed enough “pests” good things would come back to him. 

Symbolizing this he would replace the head of his previous victim with the most current.

“Cutting off a head is hard. Even if you have power tools it's messy shit. Took a while before I got the hang of it though” Cole confessed, oblivious to my disgust. “I rigged a bike pump to a catheter, snaked it through the axillary nerve until it reached the superior vana cava. It only took about two minutes before the blood stopped flowing and by then removing the head was pretty much blood free”.

Realizing killing people he knew was a sure way of getting caught Cole learned what questions to ask complete strangers to discover the “pests” in their lives. This was easier than Cole would have guessed because in the end who didn’t like talking about themselves?

“I was always good at talking to people, you know? I could talk the devil into lighting himself on fire. Because of that it was easy to learn where the pests lived, worked, drove and more.""

Since the murders were spread out nationwide and none of his victims had any connections to each other or Cole, the authorities were at a loss. When there was a news article talking about a murder no one ever mentioned that they were connected. 

“They didn't want to cause a panic, you know? It wasn't often, but when the newspapers said the head was removed, they would say it was removed with a sword or an ax or whatever. They did this so when someone tries to take credit, they say the wrong tool and the police know it's bullshit and a waste of time. Obviously I never called any of the hotlines or tried to taunt authorities. That would just give them more clues to work with.”

I felt sick. This man was crazy and dangerous. More than that, he had a gun and was sitting across the table from me. 

“At first hearing and reading about the police chasing down leads terrified me. However after so much bullshitting they did to the public, their claims that they were closing in on a suspect didn't bother me in the slightest” Cole said with a rotten tooth smile that quickly evaporated. 

A flood of tears started filling his eyes and he blinked them away before taking the first nibble of food.

Just when it seemed that he was calm, Cole shouted at me, demanding that I grab a pen and paper and jot down his tale. 

Who was I to say no? Even though he had his hands on the table there was still a shotgun in his lap. I didn’t want to bet that it wasn't loaded or that I was faster. The safe bet was just to write the story he was telling me and hope he would show me mercy.

“I was doing this for a long time. Nearly ten years at this point. And while scouting for the twenty-first victim I found myself behind a small series of apartment buildings” Cole said, shaking his head as if he was in disbelief of his own tale. “I heard a small group of people huddled around someone's basement apartment, whispering to whoever was inside. They were a ways away so I couldn't make out the details at the time but I could see that something wasn't right about them. They were dirty. Long greasy hair and beards. But there was something else about them. Something… something evil.”

“Why do you say that?” I asked without thinking. To this day I don't know if that outburst was because I was curious or tired.

“One by one they stopped their hushed whispering and turned their gazes towards me. It was creepy as fuck so I got the hell out of there” Cole responded as though he didnt hear my question. “When I took a peek over my shoulder they were following me but stayed just out of the cone of light the street lamps provided.”

I had to admit, that sounded pretty scary, but evil? I kept my thoughts to myself and kept writing.

“It creeped me out. I was already thinking of finding someone else to kill because I don’t like killing in apartment buildings. Too many neighbors to see you or hear you when you're using the saw, you know? When I saw them though, that sort of settled it. I wasn’t going to go back there. I kept looking back in the mirror on the way home to see if I was being followed but in the five hour drive I didn’t see a thing behind me. The next day, however, I noticed a car driving slowly though my parking lot every few hours. I was smoking lots of weed at the time and figured I was just being paranoid but the next night I woke up to tapping on the door”.

As Cole explained to me what happened next he started to rock back and forth the way I’ve seen children do in an effort to calm himself down before continuing his story. 

“Thought it was my imagination at first but then I started hearing my name being whispered from the hallway. When I realized I wasn't imagining the noises I looked out the peephole.”

Cole took a moment before continuing but before he spoke he swallowed and took a drink of water from the glass I gave him. 

“There were at least five of them that time. Dirty, long hair and dark sunken eyes that seemed to glow with the hatred of some sort of hellist pit. They spent the entire night begging me to come out.” 

With the exception of the eyes, it was as though Cole was describing himself. Again, this was a thought I kept to myself.

“In that building it wasn't uncommon to hear drunken exes pound on doors demanding to be let in so their begging went on for hours. Eventually a neighbor I never bothered to get to know decided to open the door to tell the strangers to keep it down. She stopped mid sentence the moment she saw them,” Cole explained. “They pushed her back into her apartment and all piled in. Through that thin wall I could hear them tearing through her place and when she cried or begged or groaned they just laughed. Eventually they made the woman beg me to come out from my apartment. Whenever she did they would laugh and instruct her to say it louder. She would comply with their demands and her reward would be getting hit more.”

“Jesus” I blurted out.

“When I refused to open the door or even respond they grew bored and started getting even more violent with the woman. First the sounds of punches and things getting broken, but then… Jesus. They were eating her. It was loud and wet and lasted until the sun came up”.

“How did you know they were eating her? They were in a different apartment.”

“They didnt close the fucking door,” Cole answered. “Saw it when I was leaving.” He was clearly annoyed with the interruption, reminding me that I didn’t want to interrupt someone who was obviously crazy. The best course of action for me to take was to remain silent and allow Cole to go on for as long as he wanted. 

Cole then quickly ate the rest of the meatloaf I heated up for him and asked for more. When I grabbed him another piece, he stopped me from heating it up so I set it in front of him instead. Considering how he looked I thought he was going to inhale it like the other piece, but it sat there for a long time before he touched it. 

“I didn't leave my room until I was confident they were gone and that it was safe to leave. There was no way I was going to stay there. No fucking way. I packed my car and took off. I didn't know what I would need at the time, so I took my camping gear, my tools, a few guns and of course, the head of the previous pest who I kept on ice. After that I went straight to some army surplus store to get the rest of what I needed.” 

At first I assumed he was going to go out in the woods, but it became obvious that what he really meant was staying at a seedy hotel that didn't take credit cards or require ID’s. 

“About a week later I was getting some grub at some grocery store, just walking in the parking lot and minding my own business, right? They drove up right behind me and laid on the horn. I didn’t even bother getting something to eat after that. I just wanted to get the hell out of there. By the time I remembered that I left the head back in the hotel's mini fridge I had already crossed two state lines.”

I could tell this bothered him greatly and I assumed it was because now the police would have a lead and find the identity of the Pass It On Killer. However, as if reading my mind, Cole let out a dry laugh and told me the reason he was sour about it, even years later, was because he has “completion anxiety.”

At this point of the story Cole had to take a moment, and knowing that he had a shotgun on his lap I gave it to him. Hoping that my kindness would be repaid and I could keep my head once he finished his tale I poured him some milk and offered him the rest of the baby carrots I had in the fridge.

Since I live alone, I don't have much food for unexpected guests. At the time I was sure the food I was offering him would be enough of an excuse for this psycho to kill me. When I set it down in front of him, my hands were trembling.

“They had to know what I was driving, so I traded my car for a van. At least I could sleep in the van, right? Saves money on hotels and shit” Cole explained. “About five weeks later I crossed their paths again. This time I was in a deep sleep when I heard them say my name. In my dream the name was like an echo and when I woke up my eyes were immediately locked on the dark eyes of a woman with the same sinister resemblance as the men I saw back at the apartment. Without a beard, however, this woman's disfiguration was more noticeable.”

“Disfiguration?” I asked.

Cole gave a grunt that might have meant nothing, something or everything. “I might as well tell you everything, right? You are writing down my tale after all” Cole said, clearly not excited to relive the experience. “At first I thought it was a cleft lip and chin but it wasn't. The few teeth that she had were small and brown and grew fucking everywhere” Cole explained as his dirty fingers were fidgeting with the gun in his lap. “Like the gums and the inside of the cheeks and shit. Even in the dark I could see their black eyes and when I jumped into the front seat and turned over the engine the headlights revealed dozens of her family. They were all standing ten or so feet apart from each other, scattered around. Some were naked but they were all standing still, smiling and just looking at me. Like they were giving me permission to leave.”

Gooseflesh covered my entire body and I was having trouble keeping up with Coles story because he was talking too fast. 

“I tried to swerve and hit a few with the front tire or to at least clip them with the van’s fat ass; however, they all stepped to the side, effortlessly avoiding getting run down.”

As Cole took a moment to catch his breath, I asked what he meant when he said “Her family.”

“Thats a recent term I gave them. At the time I thought they were demons or vampires but not any longer.”

I wanted to ask him why he no longer thought this was the case, but I kept this question to myself. I felt I pressed my luck enough at this point with all the questions I had been asking. After all this man was insane and armed.

“After that encounter I abandoned the van and stole a car. I would do this every so often, whenever I felt that they were closing in on me. A gut feeling. This was triggered by anything from something I imagined seeing in the corner of my eye to the cries coming from a murder of crows.”

Again, I had a bunch of questions but didn't dare ask them. What did crows have to do with these people after Cole?

“Zig zagging across the country I made every effort to forever rid myself of these people. I would stay inside at night and if I could I would sleep during the day. I would pass the time by reading and listening to music. You know, good music. Peter Warlock? Bach?”

I knew who Bach was, but never heard of the other name. 

“Classical?” I asked, surprised because of Cole's appearance.

“Vivaldi Concerto No. 5 is my favorite. Bet you wouldn't have guessed that I also play the cello.”

I had no idea if Cole was pulling my leg or not, but I didn't have time to react, Cole was back to telling his story.

“While on the run I would take odd jobs here and there to pay for what I needed to survive. A tractor assembly line in Michigan, a toll booth operator in Florida and a semi weight station in Nevada. Whatever job paid in cash and as long as I didn’t have to work at night. No matter where I found work I would not stay long before feeling that they were closing in on me. More often than not I would leave before getting a paycheck.”

Up to now he had been talking to me, a captive audience due to the shotgun on his lap for well over four hours. I was tired but Cole seemed to be wide awake. During a moment of silence I asked Cole if he wanted any coffee. He accepted so I made a pot for the two of us to share. 

I could feel Cole stare at me as I made the coffee and my heart was beating so loud I swore Cole was able to hear it. The silence went on for what felt like hours. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and had to break the silence. 

“How do you take your coffee?”

“Very strong. No cream. No sugar.”

As the coffee started brewing, the tension was so thick that it made the room feel as though I was breathing through a hot wet rag. This went on for some time and I think Cole was enjoying the sight of making me uncomfortable because he only continued his story when I started filling the cups.

“Before coming here I was staying at a place up in northern Canada for about three months. A loft above a bar. Figured that a bar full of people at night would keep me safe” Cole said, again fidgeting with the gun. “I had an arrangement with the owner. In exchange for the room, I would work as the janitor, unload trucks, do some deliveries, etcetera. I kept to myself and people left me alone, the only time I was ever bothered was when there was work to be done. It was nice while it lasted, however when they finally arrived they… they were under the window in the alley, softly calling out to me. With all the music being played downstairs I have no idea how long they were there, but the moment I knew it was them the giggling began.”

For some reason, giggling as soon as Cole noticed them creeped me out far more than anything he said so far. 

“They tried to flatter me by saying they were my biggest fans and tried to prove it by telling me details that only the Pass It On Killer would know” Cole said, his eyes looking into the darkened room behind me. 

“I told them off. Called them vampires because they couldn't come inside without permission. That was the first thing I ever said to them and as soon as I said that, everything went silent. I must have been used to the sounds they were making because I didn’t notice it until it stopped. That’s when someone with a strange accent told me that they were not vampires but in fact something else. Something that I---”. 

Cole never finished this thought. In the silence that followed I didn't know what he was going to do and this terrified me. 

It might have been lack of sleep on my part, possibly even momentary insanity but I had to know who, or what was chasing Cole. When I asked he didn't answer so I pressed my luck and asked him a second time 

“What else needs permission to enter a house other than vampires?”

Again he didn't answer and even though I knew it was a mistake to poke the bear I started to ask again. As soon as the words started to leave my mouth Cole reached into his inner breast pocket and pulled out what I thought at the time was paper napkins. After inspecting it for a moment with an expression I have never seen before, Cole slapped them down on the table between us. 

Written on them in everything from pen to marker to pencil were the messages “Let us in”, “Open the door” and more. It was hard to tell what else was said because the writing overlapped. However, it was clear to me that these messages were written by dozens of people.

As I picked one up to look at it closer and ascertain what else was written down on them, my finger rubbed the glossy underside. Turning it over I saw that it was a photograph showing Cole sleeping in what appeared to be a small apartment, the next appeared to be him in an abandoned bus, a dirty attic and so on. 

In some of the pictures Cole looked twenty years younger and it made me wonder just how long he was on the run for. I know that stress can prematurely age people but I had a hard time believing that the person in the picture and Cole were one and the same.

“They don't need permission to enter someone's house” he said as his gaze returned to the empty space behind me. 

I had to look back to see if anything was there and was more relieved than words could explain when I saw nothing behind me.

We sat there quietly for what seemed like an eternity before Cole said anything else. When he did it was as if he suddenly remembered that he was telling me a story and picked up where he left off. The part where they then cut the power to the apartment and the bar under him. 

“It didn’t take long before the woman tending bar that night was shouting at them not to come closer. They just laughed. They tore her apart and all I could do was listen and wait until morning to come” Cole confessed with a shake of his head as if to eject the thoughts from his mind. “Thing is, Canada has some long nights during the winter and I only had enough food for a few days”. 

Cole didn’t tell me how long he stayed in that room for and I didn’t want to ask. It was obvious from the thousand yard stare that these events were still fresh in his mind so I kept my mouth shut.

“When I finally left my room I saw gore sprinkled everywhere. Like a trail of breadcrumbs that started from behind the bar and led right to my apartment. I had seen blood before, but this was something else entirely. I was careful not to touch anything with my bare hands as I emptied the cash register and stole a toolbox from the back office so I could switch license plates to throw them off my scent.”

“Do you know how to kill them?” I asked.

Cole shook his head. “I don’t know how to stop them but I think I have a good idea how to slow them down,” but before he could elaborate he noticed that the sun was shining through my kitchen window. Grateful that he went another night without seeing them and having someone he could talk to, Cole thanked me for listening.

I didn’t know what to say to such a story. What could I say? In the pregnant silence that followed I filled the void by rambling about whatever came to mind. My job, the annoying coworkers and how my boss is always looking over my shoulder. 

As if this was at all similar to Cole's own story.

I didn’t think anything of Cole asking me if I liked my job or where I worked at the time and soon I was answering all of his questions. 

After a short while Cole thanked me again, then he stood up, took my car keys off the counter and left without another word.

It might have been ten minutes after Cole left before I called the police and all I said to them was that my house was broken into and that my car was stolen. After all, the truth was so unbelievable that if I said anything else it might make me look as crazy as Cole. 

Maybe I didn't say anything else because I was tired? I don't know for certain.

The more distance I put between myself and that night the less real it felt. But then reality set in once I learned that my boss was found dead a few days later.

According to the local newspaper, Whisper Alley Echos, pieces of my boss were found all over his bedroom. Most people in town considered this to be an exaggeration to stir up newspaper sales and I wanted to agree but it was hard to, considering Cole's tale. 

In the back of my head the idea of what Cole told me being true kept teasing me. It bothered me so much that I ended up hiring a private investigator, a decision I came to regret. I would rather be ignorant of what came next. A week after hiring the PI, I received a phone call informing me that my boss's head was found in the middle of another bloody mess all the way in Cleveland. 

Not only that, but the private investigator also informed me that the local newspaper apparently withheld the fact that a different person's head was discovered in my boss's freezer. I assume it was the head Cole left in the hotel fridge but kept this to myself.

Over the next few weeks I kept thinking of the story Cole told me. If those thoughts weren't front and center they were creeping in the back, ready to pounce on a happy moment to turn it sour. 

It didn’t take long before I started seeing dark patches dart from one shadow to the next, disappearing as soon as I turned to look at it. At first I chalked this up to being a mouse, the reflection off of my glasses or lack of sleep (After all it was much harder to sleep in a house that was broken into). Hoping it wasn't mice because of my hatred towards them I bought some medicine in town so I could get some rest at night. It worked wonders when it came to getting shuteye but did nothing to stop me from seeing these shadows.

With an embarrassing frequency I would imagine the reflecting eyes on the side of the road were Cole's night visitors or think of them whenever I heard the house settle. 

It was as though toying with the idea of them being real was enough to invite them into my life.

I don’t recall what came first, hearing my name being called out in public, a sound similar to a murder of crows cawing or the soft scraping at my screen windows at night. However once I realized that the noises and the visions were real there was no way to block them out.

At night the soft whispers were hard to make out and the more I tried to ignore them the more I thought about them.  

I could not tell you how many nights I stayed up just so I could put my ear up to the wall but I can tell you it was worth the effort, because unlike Cole, I know what they want. 

They whispered of a message that took months before I understood it fully, but in those words that only someone with a certain madness could grasp, I understood. You see, they aren’t a family like Cole said. They are more akin to nomads who will only accept members with certain propensities to join their roving community.

It wasn't as long as you might think before I did the one thing Cole was never brave enough to do and opened the door. 

The first night I opened the door for them was terrifying, like losing one's virginity. Even with Cole's descriptions there was no way I could have been prepared for their appearance because they resembled humans the way sharks look like dolphins.

During these conversations they instructed me to share Cole's story with the world so some of his madness could rub off on others and “season the meat.”

In this partnership of ours they gained a buffet of people, while I gained so much more. Not only would they tell me tales I would pass off as my own, but in time I could join their ranks. 

Heralding their coming will include everything from seeing shadows in the corner of your eyes, the sounds of whispering and something similar to the cawing of crows. 

Once these or any dozen of other signs occur, it's the beginning of the end. And when that happens you can thank me, a better and far more successful Pass It On Killer than Cole ever was.",1,1762136795.0,CreepCast_Submissions,1,1.0,False

Saturday felt slow in the best way—sunlight spilling through the blinds, the world outside unhurried.  
Oliver was still half-asleep beside her, one arm heavy across Idalia’s waist, his breath steady against the back of her neck. She could feel the warmth of him through the sheets, the soft rasp of his morning voice when he murmured, “Five more minutes.”  

She smiled into the pillow. “You said that forty minutes ago.”  
“Yeah, but now I mean it.”  

Weekends were the small kind of heaven they lived for. The weekday grind—her endless phone calls and spreadsheets, his long hours under Florida sun and engine noise—melted into these slow mornings. Here, time didn’t have edges. Just laughter and the smell of coffee drifting in from the kitchen.

He eventually rolled over, squinting at her. “You know I still can’t believe I married the bossiest woman alive.”  
“You love it,” she teased.  
“I do,” he said, grinning. “Don’t tell anyone, though. Gotta keep up appearances.”  

In public, he looked like the one in charge—broad shoulders, that easy confidence—but at home she was the quiet gravity everything orbited around. He liked it that way. She did too.

Sampson jumped onto the bed, tail wagging hard enough to shake the blankets.  
“Morning, buddy,” Idalia said, scratching behind his ears.  
Oliver groaned. “He’s jealous again.”  
“Then move over.”  
“Never. I’m the favorite.”  
Sampson barked, clearly disagreeing, and she laughed until her chest ached.  

By noon, the kitchen smelled faintly of toast and sugar. The house felt lived-in: socks on the floor, sunlight painting lazy stripes across the walls. Idalia leaned against the counter, scrolling through her phone, while Oliver measured out the shrooms on the scale. They’d read guides, compared notes, tried to be careful. Curiosity wasn’t recklessness; they just wanted to share something new together.  

“You ready?” he asked, crushing the pieces down with the back of a spoon.  
“As I’ll ever be,” she said.  
They took them at one o’clock, together—his fingers brushing hers as they swallowed.  

For the first hour, nothing but warmth. The world softened at the edges, colors blurring into a low hum. They stretched out on the couch, watching one of their comfort shows, something light and familiar.  
Oliver’s laugh filled the room; it was deep, easy, the kind that always made her feel safe.  

By two, the trip began to bloom. The air shimmered faintly. The sunlight looked thick, golden, almost syrupy. They snacked on chips, laughed until they cried at jokes that weren’t even funny, scrolled through videos and kept showing each other their favorites. Every touch felt electric but tender—his thumb tracing the edge of her hand, her head tucked under his chin.  

“See?” she said. “This is perfect.”  
“Told you,” he murmured, brushing her hair from her face. “You and me, always.”  

They talked about everything and nothing. The cats kept trying to wedge themselves between them, tails flicking across their laps, while Sampson sprawled at their feet, snoring gently. The house was peaceful, time liquid.  

Hours passed that way—smooth, seamless. At some point, Idalia realized how much she trusted him; how even in this strange, shifting state, his presence anchored her. She felt safe, completely.  

At 5:30, Cameron came home.  
“Hey, you two still alive?” he joked, dropping his keys by the door.  
“Barely,” Oliver called, grinning. “It’s been great, though.”  
Idalia laughed, “Everything’s just… warm. Like the world finally got the memo to chill out.”  

Cameron grabbed a drink, kicked off his shoes, and joined them in the living room. They talked for almost an hour—joking, sharing stories, telling him how gentle the trip had been. The house buzzed with laughter. Everything felt right.  

Then, at 6:30, the sound.  
A sudden, wet gag from the corner.  

Sampson.  

Oliver sat up immediately. “He’s choking—hey, hey, come here—”  
Cameron was already on his feet. The laughter vanished.  

Idalia turned her head. The room swayed slightly, but not in the dreamy way from earlier. Something in her chest shifted—an unfamiliar weight pressing inward. She stood to help, but the sound of Sampson retching hit her like a punch. Her stomach clenched. The air thickened.  

“Hey, it’s okay, we got it,” Oliver said, crouched beside the dog.  
But the sound wouldn’t stop.  
Her throat locked in sympathy. Heat rushed up her neck.  

“Babe?” Oliver’s voice blurred.  
She tried to answer, but nausea overtook her. She staggered toward the trash bag by the couch, barely made it before she threw up.  

And then everything began to slip.  

Her pulse swung wild—too fast, then too slow, her body caught in between. The air thickened. Her knees buckled.  
She tried to speak but the words dissolved, her breath trapped somewhere too far to reach.  

“Hey, I’ve got it, it’s okay—” Oliver’s voice, breaking through the noise—  

The world tilted. The couch blurred out of focus. The colors she’d found so beautiful moments ago curdled into static.  

Then strong arms caught her.  

And the world went dark.  

---

Heat clawed up her neck, her skin slick with sweat. Her pulse swung wildly—first too slow, a dull echo in her ears, then too fast, hammering against her ribs. The couch dipped beneath her knees. Oliver’s voice blurred through the ringing, somewhere behind her. Then his arms were around her, lifting her before she could fall all the way.  

“Hey, I’ve got you,” he whispered, his voice shaking. “It’s okay, I’ve got you.”  
But it wasn’t okay. The room spun, the air too thin, her body too heavy. The heat kept flashing to cold, and the nausea rolled through her like waves.  

He carried her down the hall, each step jarring, his breath catching in uneven bursts. When he laid her on the bed, the sheets felt like ice.  
“Let me change you, you’re burning up.”  
She tried to nod, but the cold came rushing in so fast it hurt. The chill sank deep, and she gasped. “Don’t—please—it’s too cold.” The words barely made it out, half-breathed, half-thought.  

Her teeth chattered. She was drenched in sweat but freezing. The contrast made her dizzy. Oliver’s hands hovered, helpless, and she could see the fear in his face—the kind that comes from not knowing what to do.  

“I should take you to the hospital,” he said, voice breaking.  
She shook her head weakly. “No… can’t… you’ll get in trouble.”  
“Baby, please—”  
“No hospital. Just… let me close my eyes.”  

But every time she closed them, her body stopped. The breathing reflex vanished. She drifted somewhere dark and still until his voice yanked her back.  

   “Breathe, baby. Come on. Look at me. Please—”  

The panic in him bled through the words. He was crying now, shaking her shoulders gently, tears falling onto her collarbone.  

She wanted to speak, to tell him she was sorry—for scaring him, for puking, for being so damn difficult—but her lips wouldn’t move right. Everything felt slow, syrup-thick. Her arms were heavy and tingling, her chest squeezed tight.  

She caught fragments of his voice—“I love you, I need you, I can’t do this without you”—but they came in waves, fading in and out like a bad signal. Her mind was fracturing under the noise. Thoughts split apart before they could finish. And underneath them all was that sound—*hahxydbjsiansbehcucnej*—a string of nonsense syllables that looped endlessly, behind every thought, between every word, rising until it was all she could hear.  

She tried to cry but no tears came. Her body was past the point of release. She shivered, then burned, then shivered again. Oliver kept adjusting her—propping her up, laying her down, trying to keep her breathing steady—but she felt like she was drifting away each time he moved her.  

Her consciousness flickered in and out. Sometimes she saw the ceiling, sometimes nothing at all. Each time she surfaced, her mind begged for rest, but rest felt like dying.  

“Oliver?” she managed to whisper.  
He leaned close. “I’m here. I’m right here.”  
“What happened?”  
“You got sick, baby, it’s okay, I’ve got you.”  
But she couldn’t remember. Each time she asked, the answer slipped away. The confusion felt like drowning.  

She could feel his heartbeat through his chest where he held her, could feel his breath against her temple, fast and unsteady. The air around them pulsed. She was shaking so hard she thought her bones would rattle apart.  

“I’m sorry,” she whispered, over and over. “I’m so sorry.”  
“Stop. Don’t you dare apologize,” he said, voice cracking. “You just breathe. Please, just breathe.”  

She tried. She really did. But the static roared louder, the world spun faster, and her chest clenched until there was nothing left but white noise and the faint memory of his hands—warm, desperate, unrelenting—holding her to the world as she slipped further from it.  

---

The static rose once more—then broke.  

Silence.  
Real silence.  

When she finally drew in a breath that reached all the way down, it startled both of them. The air was heavy but real. Her chest ached. Her skin prickled. The world existed again.  

Oliver had her wrapped in every blanket he could find, his body curved protectively around hers. She was on her left side, his arm slung over her waist, his chest pressed against her back. His breath trembled against her ear.  

   “You’re okay,” he whispered, voice raw. “You’re safe. Just breathe with me. Inhale… exhale…”  

She followed his words—clumsy, uneven. The world slowly reassembled itself: the hum of the fan, the faint whine of Sampson outside, the salt on her lips. Her body was sore, her mouth bone-dry, her skin slick with sweat. But she was breathing.  

Oliver’s voice steadied with every count.  
   “Inhale… exhale…”  
   “That’s it, baby. You’re doing so good.”  

Her mind cleared just enough to whisper, “I’m here.”  
“I know,” he said, pressing his face into her hair. “You scared me to death.”  

When her trembling eased, he lifted her carefully, carrying her to the bathroom. The mirror caught her reflection—eyes glassy, skin pale, hair clinging to her forehead. He cleaned her gently, wiping her face with a damp towel, his hands trembling.  
   “I love you,” he murmured. “You’re so beautiful. You’re okay.”  

He brushed her hair back, kissed her temple, and guided her back to bed. He tucked her in, pulling the blankets up to her chin, making sure not a single corner slipped loose. Then he ran to the kitchen, grabbed a cold drink, pressed it to her lips until she could sip.  

When he climbed back into bed, he gathered her close again, his chest against her spine, his hand splayed over her heartbeat.  

He didn’t sleep. He just watched her breathe, every inhale a silent thank-you, every exhale a release.  

And as she drifted off, exhausted and sore, the last thing she felt was his breath in her hair and the whispered rhythm of the words that carried her through the dark—  
   “I love you. You’re safe. You’re still here.”

The light was gray when she woke, not gold.  
Thin, colorless morning pressing through the blinds. The room smelled of salt and sweat and something metallic—fear that hadn’t quite faded.  

Idalia blinked slowly. For a moment she didn’t know where she was, only that her body hurt. Her chest ached with each breath, but the breaths were steady, real. The blankets were tangled and damp. Her head throbbed, her throat scraped raw. But she was alive.  

Oliver was beside her, half propped against the headboard, still awake. His eyes were swollen and red; he’d been crying long after she’d fallen asleep. A lamp still burned on the nightstand, its light harsh against his hollow face.  

“Hey,” she whispered, voice rough.  

He looked down instantly, relief breaking across his exhaustion. “You’re awake.”  
“I’m here,” she said, though her voice trembled on it.  

He exhaled like someone letting go of a held breath that had lasted hours. “You scared me so bad,” he said. “You stopped breathing so many times…” His voice cracked, the words unraveling.  

She reached weakly for his hand. “What time is it?”  
“Just after six.”  
“So I was out for… what? Eight hours?”  
“Since around ten. You kept fading in and out. I didn’t sleep at all.”  

He rubbed his face, the motion shaky. “Every time you stopped moving, I thought it was over. I was sure I’d lost you.”  

Her heart twisted. She squeezed his hand, thumb tracing the callouses across his knuckles. “You didn’t lose me,” she said softly.  
“I almost did,” he murmured. “And it’s my fault.”  

“Oliver—”  
“I said it would be fine. I said we’d be safe. You trusted me.” His voice rose, cracking into anger that was really grief. “You trusted me, and I almost—”  

She pressed a trembling hand to his cheek, forcing him to look at her. “You saved me,” she whispered. “You held me here. You didn’t let me go.”  

He closed his eyes, jaw flexing, tears sliding down again. “I kept thinking—if you died, it would’ve been my fault forever.”  

Her thumb brushed the tear away. “You kept me alive.”  

He didn’t answer, only pulled her gently against him. His heartbeat pounded hard beneath her ear. She could feel the exhaustion in it—the long, sleepless night carved into its rhythm.  

They stayed like that for a long time. No words. Just the hum of the fan and Sampson whining faintly outside the door. The world was waking up—birds, cars, the slow light of another day. But inside their room, everything still felt suspended.  

When she finally stirred, it was to the feeling of his fingers tracing idle circles on her back. He looked dazed, half-hollow, but softer now.  

“You need to rest,” she murmured.  
“I can’t,” he said. “Every time I close my eyes, I see you stop breathing.”  
“Then let me hold you,” she whispered. “It’s over.”  

He hesitated, then nodded, the fight leaving his shoulders. He lay down beside her, still fully dressed, one arm around her waist. His breathing slowed for the first time since the night before.  

The sky outside began to lighten. Gold threaded through the gray. The house creaked, alive again. Sampson scratched at the door, and one of the cats meowed from somewhere down the hall—sounds of ordinary life creeping back in.  

Idalia’s body still trembled now and then, echoes of the fear that had lived in her bones for hours. But she was breathing. He was breathing.  

After a while, Oliver finally drifted off, his body heavy and warm against hers. His face softened in sleep, the sharp lines of worry fading. She could still see the salt tracks where his tears had dried.  

She lay awake, staring at the faint gold strip of light growing across the ceiling. Her chest still hurt, but it was the ache of being alive, not the pain of dying.  

She thought of how close she’d come to not hearing him breathe again—how easily the world could have kept spinning without her. The thought hollowed her out and filled her up all at once.  

Her eyes stung. She pressed her face into his shoulder and let the tears come—quiet, grateful, alive.  

Outside, the morning grew brighter. The hum of the fan mixed with the sounds of life—Sampson’s tail thumping the floor, Cameron moving through the kitchen, the faint clink of mugs.  

And in the small, still world of their room, Idalia whispered into the space between their hearts:
