1nfyddp,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1nfyddp/anyone_know_this_one/,Anyone know this one,"While she carried his child, planned their future— he was building alternate realities with another woman.
She saw it.  His Gmail. And there, like a beacon of disaster, a name that made her stomach clench. Samantha.
From: Samantha
""God, today was brutal without you. You always know exactly what to say to make me laugh.""
From: Daniel
""You're the best part of my day. Sometimes I think you're the only person who really understands me anymore.""
The best part of his day.
Not coming home.
Not their life.
Not the child growing inside her.
From: Samantha
""Do you ever think about it? Just ... leaving? Starting over?""
From: Daniel
""Every day. But it's complicated. The baby...""
The baby. Not her. Not their marriage. Just a complication to navigate around.
But the worst was yet to come.
""Sometimes I look at her and feel nothing. Just ... emptiness. And that scares of me. I don't know when I stopped loving her, but I can't find my way back. I don't think I want to anymore.""
Feel nothing. Rhea's legs gave out. She sank to the kitchen floor. She have a baby coming and a husband who can't stand to be in the same room with her.
_____________
 
The Distance
""Some heartbreaks don't shatter you all at once. They dissolve you, piece by piece, until you barely recognize the person you once were."" — Beau Taplin
The late afternoon sun spilled into the living room, casting long, muted beams across the walls.
Rhea shifted on the couch, one hand braced against her aching back, the other stroking the curve of her belly. The baby moved inside her — slow and steady — a quiet, persistent drumbeat of life.
Eight months along. Another four weeks — maybe less — and everything would change.
She shifted again, wincing, and glanced at the clock. 6:45 p.m. Daniel was late again. No text. No call.
She pressed her palm against her ribs, trying to ease the tightness that had nothing to do with the baby. The words came automatically now — he's busy, work is stressful — like a prayer she'd memorized but no longer believed.
Still, the silence gnawed at her.
It hadn't always been like this.
Once, five years ago, Daniel had smiled at her across a crowded bookstore — clutching a half-read novel in one hand and a coffee in the other — and asked if she believed in fate. She had laughed, skeptical and charmed all at once. She didn't — not really. But she had given him her number, anyway.
Their first date had been a comedy of errors: wrong restaurant, rain pouring halfway through dinner, Daniel slipping on the sidewalk as he gallantly offered her his jacket. They ended up in a tiny diner, sharing soggy fries and laughing so hard Rhea thought her ribs might crack. He pecked her that night — under flickering neon lights — and whispered, clumsy and earnest, ""I think I found my person.""
She hadn't believed in soulmates before him.
She wasn't sure she believed in them now. But for a while — a bright, impossibly golden while — he made her want to.
Her fingers found the thin band on her left hand, twisting it unconsciously. The diamond caught the dying light, throwing tiny rainbows on the wall — beautiful, empty promises dancing across the paint they'd chosen together.
Now, sitting alone in the house they had once dreamed of filling with laughter and tiny footsteps, Rhea wondered where that boy had gone — the one who slipped on sidewalks and pecked her like she was the only girl in the world. The man she waited for now felt like a stranger wearing his face.
Five years ago, barefoot on a beach beneath a sky full of stars, they had promised forever. Back then, forever had felt unbreakable — something they could reach for without fear.
Even when they learned she was pregnant — terrified but thrilled — Daniel had been her anchor. He had gone to every appointment, held her hand through the nausea, whispered to her belly each night before sleep.
They talked about names. Painted dreams together.
But somewhere around the fourth month, things began to shift.
At first, it was just an extra late night here and there. Business dinners. Projects. Nothing suspicious. Nothing terrible.
Life. Stress. Growing pains.
By the fifth month, late nights became a pattern.
She often ate alone, pushing cold food around her plate, telling herself it wasn't a big deal. The baby would kick, and she'd place her hand over the movement, pretending Daniel's hand was there too.
At six months, Samantha's name started slipping into conversation.
Casual. Easy.
""Samantha helped me fix the client deck. Samantha thinks the new strategy's smart.""
By seven months, Daniel laughed at his phone more than he laughed with her.
Now, at eight months pregnant, Rhea could barely remember the last time they had planned their future together.
The front door creaked open.
Daniel stepped inside, tossing his keys into the bowl like always. He paused longer than usual, hand against the doorframe, trying to shake the tension from his shoulders.
Don't start a fight. Act normal. Pretend.
The faint scent of dinner still clung to the air — her perfume too, that vanilla scent he used to bury his face in. Guilt prickled at the back of his throat.
He hadn't meant to be this late. Hadn't meant to eat without her.
Work had bled into drinks with the team, and Samantha had laughed at something he'd said — head thrown back, genuine, uncomplicated. For a little while, he felt like the man he used to be. The one who made people laugh. The one who wasn't drowning in responsibilities he never asked for. The guilt hit him before he even reached for his keys.
He rubbed the back of his neck and stepped into the living room, forcing a tired smile.
""Sorry I'm late,"" he said, avoiding her eyes.
Rhea smiled back — careful, practiced. A polite stranger's smile.
It hit harder than he expected.
""Did you eat already?"" she asked softly.
""Yeah,"" he said, peeling off his jacket. ""Grabbed something with the team.""
He saw the way her hand instinctively moved to her belly. Saw it — and pretended not to. The sight of her, round with his child, beautiful and exhausted, made something twist in his chest. When had looking at her started to hurt?
""Good,"" she whispered.
He mumbled a half-hearted ""thanks"" and disappeared into the kitchen, desperate for something — anything — to do.
Rhea stayed on the couch, listening to the hollow sounds of a life unraveling. The baby shifted, pressing what felt like a tiny foot against her ribs, and she rubbed the spot gently. ""I know, little one,"" she murmured. ""I miss him too.""
Later that night, she sat curled on the couch, flipping through the unopened baby book they had bought months ago.
The pages were blank.
No milestones.
No memories pasted in.
No ultrasound photos.
It wasn't just the book.
It was the missed prenatal appointment she sat through alone. The maternity photos he kept promising to take, then forgetting. The nursery walls still bare, where once they had planned to paint clouds and stars.
It was the photo she stumbled across on his phone last week — Samantha standing too close, her smile too familiar, her hand on his arm.
It wasn't one huge thing.
It was the thousand tiny fractures, the slow, invisible breaking.
Rhea curled tighter into herself, feeling the baby shift within her, wondering how much more of her could disappear before no one even noticed.
The sound of laughter drifted from the kitchen — easy, light.
Curious, Rhea rose and padded quietly down the hallway, one hand supporting her lower back, the other braced against the wall.
She paused at the doorway.
Daniel stood at the counter, phone pressed to his ear, smiling in a way he hadn't smiled at her in months.
""You're the only thing keeping me sane today,"" he said warmly.
A beat of silence.
Then another laugh — low, intimate.
Something twisted low in her gut — not the baby, something darker. Her bare feet felt frozen to the floor, toes curling against the cold hardwood as his laughter wrapped around another woman's name like a caress.
She cleared her throat softly.
Daniel turned, startled. Guilt flickered across his face before smoothing into casualness. He ended the call quickly and slipped his phone into his pocket.
""Hey,"" he said lightly. ""Didn't hear you.""
""Who was that?"" she asked, though she already knew.
""Samantha,"" he answered, too casually. ""Just venting about work. Nothing serious.""
""Just a friend,"" he added, the words falling like stones between them.
Rhea nodded.
Smiled.
And felt something small and sacred inside her quietly fracture.
Her fingers tightened on the doorframe, knuckles white. For a moment, rage flared hot in her chest — she wanted to grab his phone, to scream, to make him see her, really see her. But the baby moved, and the fight drained out of her as quickly as it came.
""I'm going to bed,"" she said instead, her voice steady as glass.
That night, Daniel lay awake, staring at the ceiling.
The space between them yawned wider with every heartbeat. He could hear her breathing, uneven, probably crying silently like she thought he couldn't tell. His chest tightened.
It wasn't that he didn't love her.
He did.
But sometimes when she looked at him — asking about baby names or nursery colors — all he felt was the suffocating pressure of how much he was already failing. When she showed him paint samples, all he saw were walls closing in. When she talked about the future, all he heard was the sound of doors slamming shut on the life he'd never have.
It was easier to work late.
Easier to laugh with someone who didn't need anything from him.
He hated himself for it.
And some nights, he was too tired to hate himself at all.
The days blurred.
Daniel missed another birthing class. Rhea sat between two couples, watching partners practice breathing exercises, her own breath catching in her throat.
Forgot about the maternity shoot. She found herself standing in front of the mirror, trying to see herself the way a camera would. Beautiful. Glowing. Lying.
Worked later and later.
Rhea stopped reminding him.
Somewhere deep inside, she stopped expecting him to show up at all.
She carried it all — the hope, the fear, the loneliness — alone.
Some nights, she whispered to the baby: ""I'm still here. I'll always be here.""
Because some part of her already knew she would have to be enough for both of them.
It was a Thursday night when the truth finally settled on her chest like a stone.
They sat on opposite ends of the couch — Daniel tapping something on his laptop, Rhea holding a book she couldn't seem to read.
She tried to break the silence. ""Hey, do you want to watch that new show we talked about? The one with the time travelers?""
Daniel didn't look up. ""Maybe later,"" he said. ""I have to finish this report.""
She nodded, setting the book aside. The baby book caught her eye on the coffee table — still wrapped in cellophane, untouched. She picked it up, turning it over in her hands.
""I was thinking,"" she said carefully, ""maybe we could work on this together this weekend? Fill in some of the pages?""
His typing never slowed. ""Sure, babe. Whatever you want.""
The dismissal in his voice was so casual, so complete, that something finally snapped. She gripped the book harder, the plastic crinkling.
""Daniel.""
He looked up then, irritation flickering across his features. ""What? I said yes.""
""You said 'whatever you want.' Like I asked you to pick up milk."" Her voice trembled. ""This is our baby's book. Our baby.""
He sighed, rubbing his face. ""I know. I'm sorry. I'm just—""
""Busy. Stressed. Tired."" She finished for him, the words bitter in her mouth. ""I know.""
The distance between them wasn't just physical. It had become a silent agreement, an invisible wall neither dared to name.
She looked at him, really looked.
His hair was messier now, longer than he liked it. His face was tired, the frown lines deeper. He was the same man she loved, but he felt miles away, like he was halfway gone already, only the ghost of his presence remaining.
She wanted to call out to him. To grab his hand. To shake him and say, Don't you feel it too? Aren't you scared?
But fear kept her silent. Fear that maybe he had already felt it — and accepted it.
When Daniel finally closed his laptop and stood, he pecked the top of her head absently, like someone greeting a coworker or an old friend out of habit. Not a man in love.
The smell of his cologne lingered — different now, sharper. When had he changed it?
""I'm going to bed,"" he said simply.
""I'll be up in a minute,"" Rhea replied, her voice steady.
He nodded and disappeared down the hallway, the bedroom door clicking shut behind him.
Rhea sat there a long time after he left, the baby book still in her lap, her wedding rings clicking against the plastic as her hands shook. The sound seemed too loud in the empty room.
She opened the book slowly, running her fingers across the empty pages. ""Baby's First Smile."" ""First Word."" ""First Steps.""
All those firsts Daniel might miss. All those moments she might celebrate alone.
A tear dropped onto the page, and she quickly wiped it away, not wanting to stain the pristine paper with her sadness.
The baby moved again, strong and insistent, as if reminding her: I'm here. I'm real. I'm coming whether he's ready or not.
""I know, sweet one,"" she whispered, closing the book. ""I know.""
 
The Leaving
""He left in the same way that people leave the cinema — quietly, in the dark, before the end."" — Warsan Shire
Before dawn, Daniel woke with a start. The bedroom was still dark, but he could make out Rhea's silhouette in the grey pre-morning light. She was sleeping on her side, the only position comfortable now, one hand curved protectively over her belly, her face pale against the pillow.
He could see the dried tears at the corners of her eyes.
He wanted to peck her forehead.
To promise he would be better.
To wake her gently and say all the things he'd swallowed down for months.
But the words stuck in his throat like shards of glass.
He dressed quietly in the dark, muscle memory guiding him. His clothes from the chair. Socks from the drawer — second one down, left side, so it wouldn't squeak. He'd learned all the silent ways to leave without waking her.
His phone buzzed on the nightstand. He grabbed it quickly, afraid the vibration would wake her.
Samantha: ""Coffee before the Morrison meeting?""
He stared at the message, thumb hovering over the screen.
Just coffee.
Just a meeting.
Just another lie he'd tell himself.
The bathroom light would wake her, so he moved through the bedroom door instead, carrying his shoes.
He paused in the hallway.
He stood in the nursery doorway — still unpainted, still empty. They'd argued about colors months ago. Sage green, she'd wanted. Or maybe soft yellow, gender neutral, hopeful. He'd said yes to everything and done nothing.
A mobile hung from the ceiling, the only sign of the life they were supposed to be preparing for. Tiny elephants circled slowly in the draft from the heating vent, casting shadows on the blank walls. He reached up, stopped their movement with one finger.
In the silence, he could hear Rhea's breathing from their bedroom. Even trusting. She still slept like someone who believed he'd be there when she woke.
His chest constricted. When had he become this man? The one who left before dawn. The one who chose coffee with another woman over breakfast with his pregnant wife.
The elephants waited, frozen beneath his touch.
He could go back. Crawl into bed. Cancel the coffee. Show up for once.
His phone buzzed again.
Samantha: ""I'll bring those reports you wanted to review.""
Work. It was just work. He was providing. Being responsible. Doing what needed to be done.
The lies came so easily now.
He let the elephants spin free and typed back: ""Yes.""
In the kitchen, he moved through the routine. Coffee. Keys. Wallet. The mundane choreography of leaving.
He paused at the sink, noticing Rhea's prenatal vitamins lined up on the windowsill. Seven bottles. One for each month she'd been taking them. She'd kept them all like trophies of endurance.
A photo on the refrigerator caught his eye — from her last ultrasound. He'd missed that appointment, too. Emergency client meeting. Couldn't be helped.
The baby's profile was perfect. Tiny nose. Perfect lips. His child, growing without him.
He grabbed a pen, thought about leaving a note. But what would he say?
""Sorry, I'm a coward.""
""Sorry I'm suffocating.""
""Sorry, I don't know how to be what you need.""
The pen hovered over the notepad. The words wouldn't come. They never did anymore.
He set the pen down.
What good were promises now?
He turned away from the counter, from the vitamins, from the ultrasound photo he'd never really looked at.
Quiet steps across the kitchen floor.
No note.
No peck goodbye.
No explanation.
The front door clicked shut behind him, the morning chill rushing in. The neighborhood was still sleeping, houses dark, the world holding its breath before dawn.
In the car, he sat for a moment, watching their bedroom window. Part of him waited for the light to flick on, for her to appear, to call him back.
But the window stayed dark.
He started the engine and pulled away, telling himself it was just another day. Just another morning. Just another small betrayal in a series that had become his life.
Inside, Rhea woke to an empty bed, her hand reaching across cold sheets. She knew before she opened her eyes. The absence had its own weight, its own temperature.
The pillow still smelled faintly of his cologne — the old one, the one she'd bought him for their anniversary. She pressed her face into it, breathing deep, trying to hold onto something that was already gone.
No note on his pillow.
No peck on her forehead.
No whispered ""see you tonight.""
She rose slowly, hand braced against the mattress, back screaming in protest. The baby was low today, heavy, pressing down with urgent possibility. She moved forward — one hand on her belly, the other gripping the furniture for support — because she had to. Because the baby didn't care about heartbreak.
Only survival.
In the hallway, she paused at the nursery. The elephants on the mobile spun lazy circles, disturbed by some recent touch. Her heart clenched. He'd been here. Stood in this doorway. Looked at this empty room that should have been ready by now.
Even so, he'd left.
In the kitchen, she found his coffee mug in the sink. Still warm. He'd been here, alive in this space, and chosen to leave without a word. The notepad sat on the counter, the pen beside it. Blank.
All those words are unwritten.
All those mornings unseized.
All those chances ungrasped.
She set the table for two out of habit, then stood staring at the empty chair.
The placemat.
The coffee cup.
The space where he should be.
Slowly, like admitting defeat, she removed the second plate. Put away the extra mug. Adjusted her life to accommodate absence.
Her wedding rings caught on the drawer handle as she closed it, the sound sharp in the quiet kitchen. She looked down at them — engagement ring and wedding band, nestled together. Promises made. Promises breaking.
And somewhere deep inside her, something finally whispered:
This isn't just a rough patch. This isn't just stress or work or adjustment.
Something precious is slipping away.
And he wasn't reaching for her to stop it.
She placed both hands on her belly, feeling the stubborn life pushing against her palms. The baby rolled, restless, ready. With or without Daniel. Ready or not.
""It's okay,"" she whispered to the baby, to herself, to the empty room. ""We're going to be okay.""
But her voice cracked on the last word, and she knew — some lies were too heavy for hope to carry.
She stood there, eight months pregnant and utterly alone, watching the sun creep across the kitchen floor. Another day beginning. Another day to pretend everything was fine.
Another day to practice being enough for two.
The coffee maker gurgled, finishing its cycle. She'd made enough for two, like always.
Like always, she poured just one cup.
 
The First Day Alone
""The world doesn't stop for your broken heart. The sun still rises, coffee still needs making, and life demands you keep living even when you're barely breathing."" — Nikita Gill
The coffee had gone cold.
Rhea stared at the brown ring it left on the kitchen table, tracing the stain with her finger. Three hours since Daniel left. Three hours of sitting in this chair, watching the morning transform from grey to gold to the harsh white light of full day.
The baby hadn't stopped moving. Rolling and pressing, as if sensing the shift in their small universe.
She needed to get up. Needed to shower, eat something, pretend this was just another day. But her body felt weighted to the chair, bones heavy with a grief she couldn't yet name.
Her phone buzzed. Sarah.
""Pregnancy yoga in 20? I can pick you up!""
Rhea stared at the message. She'd forgotten. Every Tuesday, for the past two months, she and Sarah had gone together. Sarah with her perfect bump, perfect husband, perfect preparation for her perfect first baby.
Her thumbs hovered over the screen.
""Not feeling well today. Maybe next week?""
The lie came easily. Easier than explaining that her husband had left before dawn. Easier than admitting she'd been sitting in yesterday's clothes, unable to move from this chair.
Three dots appeared. Disappeared. Appeared again.
""Are you okay? Really?""
Sarah knew. Of course she knew. She'd seen the way Daniel looked through Rhea at the last prenatal class they'd all attended together. The way he'd excused himself three times to take calls. The way Rhea had smiled too brightly, laughed too quickly, overcompensating for his absence even when he was in the room.
""I'm fine. Just tired.""
Another lie. They were piling up now. A wall between her and the world.
The house felt different in the daylight. Larger. Emptier. Every sound amplified — the refrigerator's hum, the settling of wood, her own breathing. She'd never noticed how much noise Daniel made just existing in the space. His absence had its own sound.
Finally, she pushed herself up from the table. Her back screamed in protest, the baby's weight pulling her forward. She gripped the counter, waiting for the dizziness to pass.
The breakfast dishes still sat in the sink. His coffee mug. Her untouched toast. Evidence of a morning that had started with the pretense of normalcy.
She turned on the water, watched it run over his mug. Watched the last traces of his coffee swirl down the drain.
The phone rang. The landline — the one they'd kept for emergencies and telemarketers. She almost didn't answer, but habit made her reach for it.
""Rhea? It's Mom.""
Her mother's voice, bright with Tuesday morning energy, felt like an assault.
""Hi, Mom.""
""I'm at the fabric store. What color did you decide for the nursery curtains? I found the most beautiful sage green, and there's a pattern with little elephants that would match that mobile you bought.""
The elephants. The ones still spinning in the empty nursery.
""I..."" Rhea's voice cracked. She cleared her throat, tried again. ""We haven't decided yet.""
""Well, you'd better hurry. Only four weeks left! Is Daniel there? Maybe I should speak to him about finally painting those walls.""
""He's at work.""
""Already? It's barely nine. That boy works too hard.""
Rhea almost laughed. The sound caught in her throat, transforming into something else. A sob. Sharp and sudden.
""Rhea? Honey?""
""I have to go, Mom. Morning sickness.""
She hung up before her mother could respond. Before the questions could start. Before she had to admit that her husband wasn't at work. That she didn't know where he was. That he'd left without saying goodbye.
The nursery door stood open down the hall. She'd been avoiding it, but now she found herself drawn forward. Her hand braced against the wall, supporting herself as she moved.
The room smelled like possibility. Like fresh paint primer and new carpet. Like dreams deferred.
The crib, still in its box, leaned against one wall. The changing table, half-assembled, Daniel's tools scattered around it like abandoned promises. He'd started it three weeks ago. ""I'll finish it this weekend,"" he'd said.
Every weekend since.
She lowered herself into the rocking chair — the only complete piece of furniture in the room. They'd bought it together, back when they still held hands in stores. Back when choosing things for their baby felt like joy instead of burden.
The elephants continued their slow dance above her. She reached up, caught one gently.
""Your daddy was here this morning,"" she whispered to the empty room, to the baby, to herself. ""He touched these elephants. Stood in this doorway. Thought about us.""
But not enough to stay.
The baby kicked hard up under her ribs. A protest. A reminder. Life didn't pause for heartbreak.
Her phone buzzed again. She expected Sarah, but Daniel's name appeared on the screen.
Her heart stopped. Started. Raced.
""In meetings all day. Will be late tonight. Don't wait up.""
As if it were any other Tuesday.
As if he hadn't left in the dark.
As if she hadn't woken to cold sheets and silence.
Her fingers shook as she typed back: ""Okay.""
She stared at the screen, willing more words to appear. An explanation. An apology. Anything.
The typing bubbles appeared.
Her breath caught.
They disappeared.
Nothing.
She threw the phone across the room. It hit the wall where the growth chart should go, where they should mark their child's height year after year. The case cracked, but the screen stayed intact.
Like her. Cracked but functioning. Broken, but not quite broken enough.
The doorbell rang.
Rhea froze. She wasn't expecting anyone. Couldn't face anyone. Not like this — unwashed, unseeing, undone.
It rang again. Then knocking.
""Rhea? I know you're home. I saw your car.""
Sarah. Of course.
""I brought tea,"" she called through the door. ""And those cookies you like? The ginger ones.""
Rhea wanted to hide. To pretend. To disappear into the floorboards.
Instead, she struggled to her feet and made her way to the door.
Sarah stood on the porch, a yoga mat under one arm, concern written across her face. She took one look at Rhea, and her expression shifted.
""Oh, honey.""
That's all it took. Two words, soft with understanding, and the wall Rhea had built crumbled.
The tears came hard and sudden. Ugly tears. Body-shaking sobs that started somewhere deep and tore through her like contractions.
Sarah dropped everything and pulled her into an embrace, holding her as she shook.
""He left,"" Rhea gasped between sobs. ""This morning. Before dawn. He just ... left.""
Sarah guided her inside to the couch. Held her while she cried. Didn't ask questions. Didn't offer platitudes. Just sat with her in the disaster of it.
When the sobs finally slowed, Sarah quietly made tea. Found tissues. Opened the cookies neither of them would eat.
""How long have things been bad?"" she asked gently.
""I don't know,"" Rhea whispered. ""Months. Maybe longer. I kept thinking it would get better. That after the baby came..."" she trailed off.
""Has he done this before? Left saying nothing?""
""Not like this."" Rhea wrapped her hands around the warm mug. ""He's been pulling away. Working late. There's ... there's someone else. At his office. Samantha.""
The name tasted bitter.
Sarah's face darkened. ""Are you sure?""
""He laughs when she calls. Really laughs. He hasn't laughed with me in..."" Rhea couldn't finish. Couldn't remember.
They sat in silence, the weight of it all settling between them.
""What are you going to do?"" Sarah asked finally.
""I don't know."" Rhea's hand found her belly. ""I have four weeks. Maybe less. I can't ... I can't do this alone.""
""You're not alone,"" Sarah said firmly.
""You have me, you have your family, you have—""
""I have a baby coming and a husband who can't stand to be in the same room with me."" The words came out harsh. True.
Sarah didn't contradict her. Didn't soften it. Just nodded.
""Then we start there,"" she said. ""One day at a time. One hour at a time if we have to. Today, you shower. You eat. You take your vitamins. Tomorrow, we figure out tomorrow.""
""I can't even get off this couch.""
""Then we start smaller. One breath. Then another. Then maybe a sip of tea.""
Rhea looked at her friend — really looked. Saw her own fear reflected. Sarah was seven months pregnant with a loving husband and a painted nursery and everything Rhea was supposed to have. And here she sat, holding Rhea's broken pieces without judgment.
""I'm scared,"" Rhea admitted.
""I know. Be scared. But be scared while moving forward. This baby needs you functioning.""
The baby. Always the baby. The one constant in all of this chaos.
Rhea took a breath. Then another. Then a sip of tea.
It was a start.
The afternoon stretched on. Sarah stayed, her presence an anchor. She didn't fill the silence with meaningless chatter. Didn't try to fix what couldn't be fixed. She simply existed in the space, a reminder that Rhea wasn't entirely alone.
At some point, Rhea showered. The hot water felt like a small mercy, washing away the salt of dried tears if not the ache beneath them. She stood under the spray, one hand braced against the tile, the other cradling her belly.
""We're going to be okay,"" she whispered, echoing her morning promise. This time, it felt less like a lie and more like a question she might someday answer.
When she emerged, Sarah had tidied the kitchen. The breakfast dishes were done. The coffee maker cleaned. Small acts of kindness that felt enormous.
""You should eat,"" Sarah said, sliding a plate across the counter. Simple things. Toast. Sliced apples. Prenatal vitamins lined up like tiny soldiers.
Rhea ate mechanically, her body accepting fuel even as her heart rejected the normalcy of it.
The baby moved, responding to the food, and for a moment she could almost pretend this was just another Tuesday. That Daniel would walk through that door tonight, tired but present. That they would talk about their days, plan their weeks, build their future.
But the afternoon light was already fading, and her phone remained silent except for work emails she couldn't bring herself to read.
""I should go,"" Sarah said eventually, reluctantly. ""But I can stay if you need me. Mark will understand.""
Mark. Who showed up to every appointment. Who spent weekends assembling furniture and painting clouds on nursery walls? Who touched Sarah's belly with wonder instead of obligation.
""I'm okay,"" Rhea lied. Then, more honestly, ""I will be okay.""
Sarah hugged her at the door, fierce and protective. ""Call me. Any time. Three in the morning, I don't care. You're not doing this alone.""
After she left, the house felt even emptier. But somehow, the emptiness felt different. Less like abandonment and more like space.
Space to breathe.
Space to think.
Space to begin figuring out what came next.
Rhea sat in the living room as darkness crept in, her hand moving in slow circles over her belly. The baby responded, pressing back against her palm. A conversation without words. A promise without conditions.
Her phone buzzed. Daniel again.
""Staying at the office tonight. Big deadline. Don't wait up.""
She stared at the words until they blurred. He wasn't even trying to make the lies believable anymore.
She didn't respond. There was nothing left to say in the language they'd been speaking — the careful dialect of pretense and politeness that had replaced their marriage.
Instead, she did something else.
She ordered paint.
Sage green, like her mother suggested. Enough for the whole nursery. Express delivery.
It was a minor act of defiance. A tiny declaration of independence. But as she hit 'confirm order,' something shifted inside her. A microscopic tectonic plate sliding into a new position.
Tomorrow, she would paint those walls herself if she had to.
Tomorrow, she would stop waiting for him to show up.
Tomorrow, she would begin the work of being enough.
But tonight, she would sit in this empty house, in yesterday's pajamas, counting the baby's movements like a rosary of hope. Tonight, she would let herself feel the full weight of what was ending.
Because some grief demands witness, even if you're the only one there to see it.
The stars appeared one by one in the darkening sky, indifferent and eternal. Rhea watched them through the window, her hand never leaving her belly, anchoring herself to the one love that wouldn't leave before dawn.
""Just you and me, little one,"" she whispered. ""We'll figure it out.""
And somewhere deep inside, beneath the fear and the hurt and the crushing loneliness, something else stirred. Small but stubborn.
Not quite hope.
But maybe the shadow of it.
Maybe that was enough to begin.",1,1757772399.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I thought that caramelising the onions was an essential step for jap. Curry. And because they shrink down to next to nothing you need to use a large amount.

For example I just made a curry yesterday:

250g pork belly, deeply browned in pot, removed

about 700g Onions, deeply caramelised in the pork fat. 

Some carrots, some celery, little bit tomato paste into the pot

deglace with sweet red wine and some dry white. Reduced

Added knob of butter, flour. Then curry powder and shortly after veggie stock. Also grated an apple into it.

Blend. Pork in. Cocoa and super dark chocolate to taste. And cook for a little while.

Was quite good. Definitely should have added ginger for the pork. Little bit too sweet. Next time I either try adding instant coffee or skipping the wine.",3,1757772088.0,japanesecooking,1,1.0,False

1nfy6ho,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nfy6ho/i_think_i_am_backtracking/,I think I am backtracking.,"Sorry about the long story ahead.

This is my first real relationship, so I don’t have a reference point.  But I guess that’s why I’m here for advice?   
  
Some contexts (worded in hindsight): We work in the same office, and we’ve known each other for a long time. We dont report to one another, are not on the same projects and most of the work that we don't directly impact each other. 

 He confessed a few years ago, and I panicked back then, but more recently I realised I had feelings too and told him. We went out once, and it felt really good. Before that we’ve been talking for months, and we can talk about anything for hours. In those times we’ve talked we’ve always tried to clarify everything when things start to sound wrong/ when we realise the other misunderstood. This connection feels special and rare for the both of us.   
  
Then my life happened. In the span of two weeks my parents both underwent major health issues one after the other. Mixed in with the fact that it was already an eventful month at work combined with other family commitments (overseas family coming over for a major milestone in my life…). I started spiraling and shutting down. He’s always been there for me and at the time I was making sure that I’d tell him where I am at, though a lot less chatty, that this is what i’m dealing with.    
  
Two weeks ago, approaching my overseas family leaving, whom during this time has been my cushion for everything that went down, I got so sad that I shut down and at the same time was getting overwhelmed with coming back to work post carer’s leave. Then it felt like work went a bit downhill with things breaking out of my control. August made me realise that I’m loaded with all responsibilities and that I desperately need to grow up, and I felt bad for liking someone as if I don’t deserve it or, it’s because I enjoyed it too much that now all bad things are happening to me. Do bad things happen because I neglected signs? I can’t properly explain this irrationality…  
  
My spirals led to me stop replying for a week. I know this is horrible and knew I’d address it in person in due time.   
  
A week ago, he approached me in person saying he wanted to chat. I couldn’t make it on the day but promised to next day morning, explaining my chat blackout. Next morning I told a him in person that with all the stuff going on and me being worried about us being colleagues and this job being important for both of us I needed to “step back.” At the time, it felt like the mature, sensible thing to do as I was worried about mixing personal and professional life.  
  
He took it very seriously and we promised to stay friends. I messaged to check in on him the next day (I obviously very much still care a lot), I didn’t want him to take it personally and told him that this isn’t because I don’t like him anymore, but I couldn’t shake the idea of us being colleagues. he told me not to worry and that he had processed it, he told me he understood but was frustrated when I didn’t reply, though he knew something was not right. Also, that he’s disappointed at our life situation. I scheduled in a morning coffee this coming week, where I was gonna tell him all that which i said in the chat but it just all came out that night where we talked for an hour but the coffee schedule is still there.  
  
The problem is, over this past week I’ve realised that stepping back hasn’t actually made things easier. I thought I’d feel relief, but instead I feel worse. I can’t shake the fact that I still really like him, and pretending to be “just friends” feels impossible right now. If my work concerns were the real reason, I don’t think I’d be this torn up especially since we don’t even work that closely together day to day. I’ve been thinking about this everyday since, with many back and forth of what I should and shouldn’t do.   
  
I’m thinking to talk to him during that coffee chat. I know it’s selfish after he’s already processed things, but I wouldn’t tear this back open if it hasn’t been all consuming for me this past week.    
  
I want to tell him:  
  
\- I respect that he’s moved on from the step back.  
\- I’ve realised it didn’t change how I feel, I still like him.  
\- I don’t expect anything, and I’ll respect it if his answer is no.  
\- I’ll prioritise work first ( which we have both made abundantly clear is important for us), always, and I want to take things one step at a time if he’s open.  
  
Part of me is scared he’ll say no, and I’ll be sad. But I also selfishly think that it would give me closure. What feels worse is the idea that we both want it, and I let fear be the only reason it doesn’t happen.  
  
I know now that there were flag flags in how I handled everything, though tough at the time, knowing how it can hurt others I will work on them.  
  
TL;DR: Told a coworker I liked that we needed to step back, he processed it and respected it, but now I regret it and want to tell him I still like him. Afraid I’m being selfish or putting pressure on him, but also afraid of living with the regret if I don’t say anything.",1,1757771897.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

TL;DR - I live in Egypt and can’t find anywhere that’s willing to sell me green beans, I’ve considered ordering internationally but I don’t know how easy that is especially with it being agricultural. What would people suggest I try to source them?

So I live in Egypt where the prices of specialty coffee has sky rocketed and worst of all…roasters don’t put a roast on date and most of the time I’m paying premium for stale beans that have been on the shelves for two months or so…

Anyways I’ve ordered an air roaster that does 110g batches I know that’s small but it’s my first roaster. it’s called cecotec coffee roaster 1400W from Amazon (like the cafemasy one) and found one possible supplier but they don’t have a site to visit and no reviews online but apparently they’re willing to sell me green beans from their limited specialty coffee range which should be arriving today actually.

There is another place I’ve found selling the skywalker V1 roaster but obviously it’s abit of an investment at that price so I wanna make sure I can always have a study reliable supply of beans before taking the decision to buy the roaster.

I need help understanding the sourcing routes one can take to find green beans from a trustable seller and things to look out for when buying beans 🙏🏼",1,1757771864.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

Due to ""no self-promotion"" rules of this sub I am not allowed to share the link to the Substack post, but the Mod has allowed this form of sharing my content. So here it comes:* 

I have never been on a diet; not in the broadly assumed meaning of the word. I have always considered myself to be one of the people with a pretty reasonable attitude towards food — I know that fruit and vegetable are healthy, while sweets and fast-food are not. Therefore, every dieting idea that focuses on excluding entire food groups, cleanliness and detoxifying, or only eating one specific thing (I think there was something with cabbage?) is generally treated by me with utmost suspicion. I have never liked the “diet culture” nor found it reasonable; I have read about keto, paleo, intermittent fasting, mediterranean diet, gluten-free diet and so on, but have never done any of them.

The only real weight loss attempts of mine were centered around the motto “eat fewer sweets and exercise more” — which I still don’t think it’s a bad idea per se. But the numbers on my scales made me realize that this is simply not working well enough.

Because, my dear readers, I have been overweight for quite a while. No, I’ve never ventured into the 'obesity' bracket, but if I’m to be honest, I have been slowly yet steadily heading towards it for some time. Not quickly, not linearly (my attempts at curbing sweets and exercising did do some job), but ultimately in that direction nonetheless.

Camera freeze. Zoom in onto my face.

So you’re probably wondering how I’ve found myself in this situation.

After a few weeks of calorie-counting behind my belt, I think I can make an educated guess as to how this situation came to be.

So, the backstory goes like this.

I used to have this conviction that I generally eat pretty well and that if something needs to change, it’s my sedentary lifestyle. And having seen the numbers, I can’t say I have been completely deluded — I do prepare plenty of home-cooked meals, I do not balk at the thought of eating vegetables, I do like my soups and try to not overeat. Seriously, it could have been way worse.

BUT even though my eating habits were pretty decent *most* of the time, I would still “fall off the wagon” *some* of the time — there would be a movie night with a bunch of paprika chips or those amazing bacon-flavored ones, or somebody would bring a bunch of cookies… You catch my drift.

I still don’t think that letting myself loose during social gatherings is something to self-flagellate over. Those are good snacks, man.

HOWEVER, since those times were never followed by a period of restricted calorie intake, but rather by a period of mere “maintenance”…

The needle has never had any reason to move backwards. The only thing I have achieved is stopping the weight gain for a while, until the next moment of weakness.

So slow but steady, the specter of obesity was creeping in.

# Why have I always hated the idea of counting calories?

Hating the idea of calorie-counting has a lot to do with my skepticism about diet culture in general. The trend of putting everything into numbers, expecting clear-cut results and beautiful progress graphs, treating your body more like a machine that you can “bio-hack” and “optimize” rather than a part of yourself to live in agreement with… I frown even as I think about it. It is not me and it is not how I want to treat myself.

I have always felt that calorie-counting is a first step towards eating disorders — it creates an unhealthy obsession over food and makes you question every single morsel that you put into your mouth. I imagined going to sleep with a rumbling stomach because the calorie limit for the day is used up, with nothing to “spare” for supper.

On top of that, I truly hated the idea of weighing everything. Every Single Thing. All The Time.

How many grams of oats? How many milliliters of milk? How much is “a handful” of berries? Imagine cooking a proper meal: do you weigh potatoes before cooking or after? And pasta? Does a “pinch” of spice matter? Do I need to find a proper size of egg (S, M, L) in the calorie-counting app? Does my glass have a 200 ml, or 250 ml, or something in between?

Cooking can take a lot of time even without all that additional weighing and measuring. And let’s not get started thinking about eating out — that’s another row of question marks.

Does it sound annoying as fuck to everybody, or is it just me? Because just thinking about it made me feel like I’m on fast-track to developing some kind of eating obsession.

# Then why do it?

Because it was time to admit that my previous attempts have not been successful in the past, and that maybe it was time to try something else. You know, in order not to do the same thing over and over while expecting different results.

Additionally, because I have seen a person close to me start counting calories (with an opposite goal — to gain weight) and end up being pretty successful while managing to not go completely bonkers about it.

Also, because I hate an idea of a “typical” diet — keto, paleo, eat fewer carbs, eat more carbs, eat only carbs, all those things — even more. And I still believe that those are not a long-term solution, because a long term solution can only be found in a change of lifestyle, i.e. improving your diet for good.

So, you know, following my own damn belief, I had to try and improve my diet for good. And I have realized that calorie-counting can be a means to an end — **a temporary measure**.

Since I didn’t lose much weight while trying to just vaguely “eat well”, I realized there must be some discrepancy between what I *thought* I was eating and what I was truly eating, not only when it comes to calories but also general “healthiness” of it.

All those reasons made me go: okay, I’ll bite.

It was a spur of a moment decision. I thought to myself: I will install that damn calorie-counting app (Fitatu, for the curious ones), I will put in my damn data, pick that damn weigh-loss goal, and start tracking all those damn things I am eating. Let’s see whether that will bring about some real change.

# And how is it going?

It has been several long weeks. About three months in fact. I have started mid May and have more or less persisted till now (and I do not plan to stop until I’ve reached my goal).

A few conclusions that I can already share:

• it is working (I am amazed)

• it is really darn working (I kinda hate it)

• it is as annoying as I had thought (you *do* need to weigh all the things)

• but it does gets *significantly* less annoying over time (you can copy-paste a lot of things, you can put your own the recipes in the app — you add all the ingredients and define how many portions that makes — and then you can just quickly tap and add 'one portion of that dish')

• it did help me discover some things that I haven’t realized, which in turn led me to establish a few rules for myself that help me stay within my calorie limit more easily

And since itemized lists seem to do well on the Internet, let me share those with you.

# A few practical rules that help me stay within my calorie limit

Just so that we are clear: those are rules for *me*, created by *me*, and based on the insights I drew from *my* diet. Feel inspired by them if you wish, but keep in mind — I am not a dietitian, I am just an amateur writer ranting about my weight.

With that in mind, let’s go:

**1. When eating out, always order water. No exceptions.**

Admittedly, the coffees and teas served in German restaurants are usually nothing to write home about. And all the other things — Coke, Fanta, juices, Schorles (mixes of juice and fizzy water; it’s a German thing), home-made lemonades — these are the things this rule was made for. Liquid calories add up fast and I’ve decided I would rather just eat them.

**2. Avoid fast-food, but when the real craving strikes — go for it, but stay away from full menu sets. No extras.**

Yes, just go to MacDonalds and grab a single burger or 6 pieces of chicken nuggets. No extra fries, no extra drink — see point 1. about water. Also, a durum kebab cut in half will very much be enough for you (and hey, you will have kebab for two lunches instead of one!).

(Is talking to myself through Substack essays unhealthy? Asking for a friend.)

**3. Better one big crêpe/tortilla than three small ones.**

I have realized that crêpes and tortillas are in themselves pretty calorie dense, while not really bringing much to the table. They’re just a container. Therefore it is *way* better to focus on making a solid filling — for instance beans, meat, bell pepper — and packing the tortilla or crêpe *to the brink*, so that in the end one portion is enough.

And let me tell you, I used to eat a bunch of crepes just with a jam filling quite often… and I will do it again! But I now know that it definitely counts as a high calorie treat, even if it looks so innocent on the plate.

**4. When eating out is not a goal in itself, find a sushi place.**

This rule is meant specifically for those situations when I’m out in the city running errands, I get hungry but there is still lots to do, and so I start looking for a place to grab a quick bite.

Again, and I find it to be an important distinction, this is for practical situations, and not for the times that I go out *for the purpose* of eating.

So during those times when I’m getting hungry and I need to eat out, I made it my default choice to try and find a sushi place. Many other quick options are so calorie dense: fries, kebab, a Curry Wurst or even innocent Fischbrötchen (I am living in Germany) — all those are rather suboptimal choices for when one is on a diet, but when hunger strikes, the monkey brain gets cloudy. So having a pre-determined default choice is a great way to solve this.

In a sushi place, a bunch of maki or nigiri arrives very quickly, often with an option to have it as a take-out. If I have more time — or am simply more hungry — sitting down for a proper meal, say a rice bowl with toppings, also leaves me both satiated and doesn’t make me dread opening my calorie counting app.

Ever since I made this decision (I know, I make it sound like such a groundbreaking thing when it’s maybe a dreadfully obvious idea for some of you), trying to keep my calorie goal while being out in the city has become way easier.

**4. Eat more vegetables. Way more.**

I know, I’m throwing so many innovative takes at you right now; I don’t know how you’ll be able to take it. But hear me out: veggies are the king of low-calorie food that is also very filling.

Now you might ask yourself, “since those are the rules she made for herself, does it mean she hasn’t thought about this one before?”

Not entirely. I obviously knew eating more veggies is good for you, but now I’m also seeing *the numbers*.

And let’s make this clear — eating vegetables is good for you not just because of calories; that’s just the thing I happen to be focusing on right now. There’s a gazillion other reasons to eat them, and eat them plenty, but even if one just wants to focus on losing weight while not feeling hungry, veggies are already the answer.

I thought I’m alright when it comes to eating vegetables, but I would also ride a sinusoidal wave when it comes to that — sometimes I would eat more, have a phase for a few days, but more often than not, a lot of leftover veggies would get thrown away. That happened frequently enough that I’d hesitate whether to really buy that head of lettuce or that cabbage, because rarely there’s a recipe that would use up the entirety of the thing I purchased. And so it would go bad, and then I would feel bad about food waste. Yikes.

Nowadays I’m attempting to add a side salad way more often (once a day), and that one simple trick is already enough to both increase my veggie intake and decrease the calories in the entire meal. Imagine that: you’ve got a bunch of tacos to eat. You would usually need 3 to feel full, but now you also eat a side salad and you need only 2. Seems silly, but when tacos are filled with heavy creams, cheese and fatty meat, it can make one hell of a difference. Other examples include turning one take-out meal (e.g. egg fried rice) into two by adding a home-made salad to it.

I’ve learned how to make a slaw and a few really nice salad dressings (which have to be explicitly without vinegar, because I swear to god I can smell this shit even when a neighbor *thinks* about opening a bottle), so I am truly enjoying this nutritionally informative ride.

# To summarize this ridiculous dietary ramble

I still don’t enjoy counting calories, but I stopped demonizing it in my mind. I can definitely see its value — both dietary and educational one.

My deep conviction that calorie counting is not a healthy long-term solution remains, but I’ve opened myself to the idea that maybe the crux of the matter lies somewhere else. In a world where so many readily available food products contain an insane number of calories, maybe it’s no wonder that we need to reach for artificial solutions to combat the problem.

I do very much hope that calorie counting can be a temporary measure for me — a measure that will end up not only in me weighing less, but also in my better understanding of what products to beware of (“beware of” does not equal “avoid at all cost” but rather “consume it as a rare treat”). My plan is to stop counting the calories as soon as I can, but keep weighing myself regularly in order to catch the point when I may need to start calorie counting again (which, hopefully, never really comes).

It definitely helped that I started perceiving the calorie counting as a food-learning journey instead of a weight-loss journey. Clearly, I do not delude myself as to why I am doing this, but while I don’t enjoy the weighing and the logging, I do enjoy those moments of surprise when I discover, “oh, this has way fewer calories than I thought!” and “uh oh, that one is a god damn calorie scam!”.

I feel like I’m participating in a debunking video (unfortunately, I’m debunking my own misbeliefs; fortunately, that video is only ever gonna play in my own head).

# Strangely philosophical finale

This little adventure with challenging my own beliefs about calorie-counting — and seeing results so much earlier than I expected — made me stare into the distance one day and think deep philosophical thoughts, way deeper ones than the matter at hand truly justifies.

These thoughts go as follows.

Sometimes, even when we are very reasonable people with very reasonable beliefs — as we all think we are — it can be greatly beneficial to question ourselves and be ready to hear the answers that oppose our views. Those answers don’t necessarily mean that our convictions have been completely wrong; they may just help us evolve and deepen them. Changing our mind on one topic does not require us to flip our personality 180 degrees.

What is more, it is important to notice when we are spinning in circles —repeating the same thing over and over again, but trying to do it “better” each time. Sometimes it’s good to take a step back, reassess, and realize that this is not working. Doesn’t mean the method is inherently wrong — but there might be a method that actually works for you way better.

(Fun thing is, for the longest time I was so convinced that while the calorie-counting can work for *some* people, it surely isn’t for me. I was so mistaken, it’s hilarious.)

So if at first you don’t succeed, try and try again. And if you still end up unsuccessful and frustrated, how about you just really give something else a go — maybe even that thing you have been really skeptical about.

And finally, when you decide to do that thing you didn’t particularly want to do, remember that you can still carve your own path.

I think of it as following a new recipe: the first time I cook from that recipe, I’ll follow it really close — and yet I will already pick out the things that I know for certain I dislike (see: vinegar; I’ll change it for lemon juice). I make notes based on this experience — was it over- or under-seasoned for my taste, what additional things could fit in the dish, and whether the recommended baking settings fit the reality of my oven. The next time I make that meal, I will follow not only the recipe, but also my notes, and so the cooking process will develop over time and become more “mine”.

When it comes to creative endeavors, novel writing in my case, I follow roughly the same pattern. For instance, I learned about the Snowflake method for outlining a novel and then I followed it very closely… to the point of vinegar. Then I tweaked and observed the results. And thanks to this simple idea, I’m finally past my fateful chapter one (but let’s not mistake “simple” for “easy”, for it was not).

If you have followed this insane dietary stream-of-consciousness extravaganza till this point, I am seriously impressed. Pat yourself on the back, you deserve it.

And stay focused on your art (even when I’m clearly not),

I had been having so much trouble finding a good AP online. Then I finally found one. It was magical. For the first 24 hours we texted nonstop like teenagers. We quickly developed trust and planned to meet for coffee. We met for coffee, and it was an instant match. I could stare into her eyes all day. We kept talking and forgot to order anything. Then we drove around in my car and couldn't keep our hands of each other. When it was time to go, she hugged me and wouldn't let go. I got the butterflies I hadn't felt in a decade. She did too. We spent the next few days chatting, sharing selfies, and planning our next meet up.

This morning I woke up to the worst text I could imagine. As I had told her I couldn't change my situation, she said she is talking to somebody else who is open to the idea of changing their situation. She told me because we had decided to be honest about the possibility of going to something else that might suit us better. I wish I could tell her that I couldn't possibly find something better that would suit me.

But I'm smiling and pretending like it's no big deal as I watch her walk away. I guess I really do want her to be happy.

This week has been a rollercoaster that involved all the best feelings: a good friendship, deep conversations, opening your heart out, an instant connection, the butterflies, and unfortunately, heartbreak.

1nfy0mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreams/comments/1nfy0mg/oh_my_god/,Oh My God!,"A few days back, I was watching a podcast with Whitley Strieber interviewing a fellow on lucid dreaming(sorry, his name escapes me). I knew immediately that this was something I had to experience. I checked out Amazon and ordered a book on lucid dreaming and one on astral projection. As I write this post, neither book has yet arrived. Early this morning, I had a session of meditation. It was fairly uneventful(no lights, no images of people, just a feeling of restfulness afterwards). I then decided it was time to go to bed. As I lay there in bed, I thought I'd try this gent's technique I saw on the podcast. He recommends quieting your mind and visualising a chalkboard, with your lucid dream 'request' or goal written on it. So I did just that. I requested visiting Rome in 72AD, along with a picture of the Coliseum as it would've looked 2000-plus years ago. It seemed to take forever for me to get to sleep, but I persevered. The last thing I remember before slumber hit me was my mantle clock striking 3 am.

I was then dreaming. It started out as all of my dreams ever had, with me unaware that I was dreaming. I found myself, along with my stepdad, outside an abandoned type building, maybe a monastery. I remember thinking that I wanted to explore it, but felt inhibited as there were a couple of houses really close, and maybe we were on private property and might be told to leave. I then found myself next to my Ninja ZX-9R, and reached for my coffee mug, the honking big one I have with Starbucks printed on it, and took a sip of my tea. Then it occurred to me, how could I possibly have my big mug at hand if we'd arrived on our bikes? I even said this to my stepdad, and he just gave me a puzzled look. I then realised I wasn't wearing a shirt, something I would never do riding, even underneath my leather jacket. It then hit me! I actually said out loud, ""Holy f\*\*k! This is a lucid dream!"" But then I thought to myself, wait just a moment, I put in a request for ancient Rome, and this definitely is NOT ancient Rome! Nevertheless, I tried doing a bit of flying, because, well, this is something I'd always wanted to do(the kind without a plane, of course). For some reason, I was only able to get a few feet off the ground, and I thought that this was a bit disappointing.

I then thought that, as this was a lucid dream, we could explore this monastery to our heart's content without worrying about 'trespassing'. Just then, one of those old-fashioned, station wagon-type ambulances, painted in a psychedelic '60s style that hippies used to drive, pulled up and nearly hit the wall of the monastery(maybe it had bad brakes). Out poured a bunch of young people who then joined us inside. This is where things get really interesting, and, umm, a bit x-rated, to say the least. I found myself attracted to one of those young guys, went up to him and thought, hell, since this is my lucid dream, why not, and we began making love. Yes, we went all the way, and no, I didn't care one bit that anyone, including my stepdad, might see us, because I knew this was all just a dream! All I'll say is that it was fantastic!

After this, I stepped outside and finally found myself in, you guessed it, Rome! But this wasn't ancient Rome, it was the Rome of today. Regardless, it was strikingly beautiful. It was the golden hour, the sun was nearly below the horizon, and the city was draped in the most gorgeous, golden light. I can say with absolute certainty that, yes, we do dream in wonderful technicolour! This terrace was filled with people in recliners, sipping cocktails and watching the beautiful spectacle laid out before them. I went to each one and asked, ""Are you a Roman?"" All replied yes, except one man, who told me he was the curator of the Pergamon amphitheatre(go figure). I wanted to explore this beautiful city, and as I made my way down the terrace, suddenly everything changed, and I now found myself on a dark, alien-looking landscape, where two spaceships, similar to the PanAm Orion III's from '2001: A Space Odyssey, had collided. Being an RN, I thought my services might be needed, but fortunately, the occupants of both were only slightly injured and were already being taken away in old-style M\*A\*S\*H-style army ambulances(again with the ambulances!).

I then moved along, and now I was in a medieval landscape, alongside a jousting tiltyard, and two knights were doing their thing of, well, jousting. I suddenly noticed a mysterious elderly woman wearing a medieval headdress. She proceeded quickly down a warren of narrow, wooden allies, and I followed her. I saw a door close, and went in. There she was, sitting in a recliner, and as she began adjusting the chair's controls, I actually blurted out to her, ""You have electricity!"" She replied, ""Yes."" I then thought, of course, she has electricity, why not? This is a dream after all! The woman then told me to prepare for the coming of God. I looked at her rather incredulously and then replied, ""God? You mean the God of Christianity?"" She replied, 'Yes, God"". I then said, ""The Creator God?"", and she replied, ""Yes, the Creator"" It was then that I awoke. I checked my clock and it was a little past 0430. This entire experience lasted roughly 90 minutes.

I lay in bed, and all I could say was ""Wow...Wow...Wow!"" I laughed, and thought my head might explode! What a f\*\*king incredible experience, and I hadn't even got the book yet!

1nfxxgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nfxxgg/im_so_thirsty/,I'm so thirsty,"The words echoed around in my head. 

I stood staring at the water tumbling from the tap. I'd been standing for what felt like hours, just watching it, going over and over the events of a few nights ago. I’d only seen that homeless man twice, but each time was vividly ingrained in my memory. Both times had been unnerving, but the second time… that was downright unhinged.

The first time had been just before work. I’d been walking the last part of my usual route, earphones in, walking on autopilot. In the brief silence as the song skipped to the next one, a clattering caught my ears. Startled, I turned to find its source.

In an alleyway behind a KFC, something rustled in the bins. It was the briefest of things, I could just about hear it over the song that had now started up. At first, I assumed it was an alley cat diving for its dinner. But then he stood, a black bag clutched in his fist. He didn’t seem to notice me watching him, he seemed far too enamoured with his prize.

Giddily, he raised it high above his head. Yellowing, foul liquid spewed from a split in its base, splashing into his eager, excited mouth below. Small chunks of rotting god knows what dribbled down with it, catching in his beard, but he didn't seem to care. His expression was almost gleeful.

I reflexively shuddered at the memory, blinking frantically to try and wash away the nausea it brought with it. The sound of the water dragged me back to my kitchen. The crystalline twinkling as the strip light above me filtered through it entranced me. Subconsciously, I slipped my hand into the torrent, letting the cool droplets wash over my fingertips.

For a second, I thought about cupping my hand, bringing it to my mouth. A queasy squirming in my stomach stopped that thought in its tracks as I remembered the second time. 

It had been worse, way worse.

I was nearly home, sat on the bus for the last part of my journey. Again, I had my earphones in, lost in my own little world. I know it's not the best thing to do on public transport, but I needed some kind of distraction.

I was jolted out of it when we came to a sudden stop as the driver slammed on the brakes. Taking my earphones out, several other passengers looked around, concerned looks on their faces, all drawn towards that front window. What I saw sent a cool chill trickling down my spine.

He was there again. In the middle of the road. 

That same homeless man, the stains of bin water still fresh on his already filthy clothes. He charged around the road, movements wild and erratic. Lurching left and right, he’d stagger one way, then the other, turning on a dime.

He was hunched over, hands outstretched to the floor. I caught the briefest glimpse of grey and pink inches from his fingers before it was snatched up. In a flurry, his hands wrapped around the thing, squeezing it tightly as he jerked it towards his face.

A trickle of crimson dribbled from the corner of his mouth, an earsplitting screech accompanying it as he bit down hard, the rat scrambling frantically between his fingers. He pulled his head back, revealing the rat again.

A large portion of its back was just… just gone.

The homeless man didn't seem to care. To a chorus of screams from my fellow passengers, he pressed his lips to the exposed flesh again and sucked hard. All anyone could do was watch on, horrified, as the man seemed to drain every ounce of fluid from the rat, siphoning everything it had.

I’m pretty sure someone behind me threw up, but I was paralysed, my eyes locked on the disgusting scene before me. A flash of anger darted across his face as he hurled the rat to the other side of the street, throwing his head back and letting out a yell.

“I’m so thirsty”

No one dared move, the bus was deathly silent.

As though realisation had suddenly dawned on him, the man scanned from side to side frantically, like he wasn’t really sure of where he was, before darting down a side alley. 

An uneasy feeling spread through the bus after that as the driver pulled away. No one dared utter a word. I think we were all traumatised by what we’d just seen.

When I finally got back home, I couldn’t relax, the gleeful expression of the homeless man replaying over and over in my head. I couldn’t bring myself to cook, every time I thought about food, all I could see was the gaping back of the rat.

Sleep didn't come easily either. I spent most of the night tossing and turning, trying to put the memories out of my mind. When I did finally manage to drop off, I had the strangest dream.

I was wandering in what I can only describe as an empty bog. It was dark, illuminated only by the crimson moon overhead. Through its reflection, I could see the translucent waters beneath me, blood red and still. 

With each step I took, the thin layer of water rippled outwards, going on unnaturally far, the undulations licking at my shoes.

There were trees spaced here and there, their long roots sucking up as much of the water as they could. Their trunks seemed to stretch on, climbing up and up until they were lost from sight. 

I couldn't make out what sat at their peak, but I couldn't help the feeling of being watched. Something about them made my skin crawl, and I couldn’t escape the unease that washed over me whenever I dared to glance in their direction.

A series of soft chittering clicks would shatter the stillness. Seeming to emerge from the trees, it was as though they were crying out. 

They shuddered, the vibration passing like a ripple all the way up their trunks as the sides seemed to split and more red water cascaded out. At the very edge of my hearing, I could have sworn that a low, angry grumble emanated from somewhere unfathomably high above me.

The more I looked at them, the more that clawing dread grew, screaming at me to tear my eyes away. Giving in to it, I averted my gaze, looking down to the glassy liquid at my feet. 

As I stared into it, I caught the briefest glimpse of movement. Straining my eyes to focus, it came again. I could make out small creatures writhing within it. They danced and turned, intertwining, then separating in intricate patterns as they swam.

I was mesmerised, watching their whirling and spinning reflected by the moonlight. The dread that had gripped me seemed to slip away, an odd sense of serenity slowly taking its place as I watched the beautiful ballet playing out in the water before me.

Something about these creatures seemed to call to me. Made me feel… safe?

I found myself crouching down, my mouth wet with saliva. I’d not even noticed, a small droplet falling from my lips the only indication. It rippled as it fell, the wavelets stretching on as the dancing creatures suddenly stopped their performance. 

As one, they darted to it, congregating together in a small ring around where it fell, what I assume was their heads looking up at me. It was so strange to see them so still. They all floated there, their thin, sinuous bodies watching me, beckoning me.

Unthinking, I dipped my hand into the water. It was cool, pooling in my cupped hand as I scooped them up. Bringing it to my lips, I drank deep, feeling each of the creatures wriggling and writhing gratefully in my open mouth as I smiled.

I snapped awake. 

My sheets were cold and damp, doing their best to cling to me. There was an odd, metallic taste on my tongue, like I’d sucked on an old coin, but it seemed to clear with a few swallows, and I thought nothing more of it. I tried to push the dream and those hideous memories to the back of my mind and just get on with my life.

It's been two days since then. Two, god-awful days. 

I barely noticed it at first. It was there when I woke from the dream. Just a dry tickle at the back of my throat, like when you’ve slept with your mouth open.

I’d take a sip of water, and it would go, but within minutes, it would be back again. A part of me felt like it was stronger each time it came back, even if only slightly so. I just put it down to being the beginnings of a cold and tried my best to ignore it, assuming it would get better in a couple of days.

But it just seemed to get worse.

In little over 24 hours, it had gone from an annoying tickle to a persistent, nagging pain. My tongue was tearing at the insides of my mouth with each movement. Speaking felt like an agony. My lips felt as though they were about to crack. Every time I swallowed, it felt like razors running down my throat.

But no matter what I did, nothing helped.

The obvious thing seemed to be to drink more water. But I’d already tried that.

Back in the kitchen, the tap still ran. The words of the homeless man echoed around in my head as I stared at the rush of water billowing from it. Grappling with the memories of those encounters, I watched my water bottle filling slowly, my impatience growing as each second seemed to stretch on and on.

I could barely wait until it was full before snatching it back and bringing it to my lips. The water sloshed out and into my gaping mouth. I felt it coat my dry tongue and slip down my arid throat.

Ravenously, I drank, emptying the bottle of its contents in seconds. The last of the icy liquid trickled from the neck, but there was no momentary relief this time.

My mouth still felt just as dry.

Turning the tap back on, I thought maybe I’d not drunk enough, maybe I needed more. Water bottle outstretched, I watched the crystalline liquid tumbling in a sharp jet. As it tumbled, an odd feeling overtook me.

My mouth was so dry, so painfully devoid of moisture, but the one thing that should remedy that repulsed me. It was the same tap, it made the same sound and produced the same stream as it always had. It had been purified and was sanitary, but it may as well have been sewage run off for all I wanted to drink it.

But I was still so thirsty

I still needed to drink.

Forcing it to my lips, the taste was almost rancid. The dryness burned my throat in a new flare of pain. I spat it out as though it were acid, for all it seemed to sting, half expecting it to burn a hole in the floor next to me.

I tried everything.

Juice. Nothing. 

Coffee. I gagged. 

Milk, beer, and vinegar. More pain.

Everything tasted wrong. They all had that rotten, sulphurous edge. The only thing that didn’t make me gag was... meat juice.

I’d come to make my dinner, opening up a packet of mince. Taking out the slab of meat, I dropped it in the pan, the soft sizzle fading to nothing as I stared at the empty container in my hand. 

It was like my eyes had been drawn to it, the muddy red sludge sitting in the bottom, calling to me.

Without quite registering what I was doing, I brought it to my nose and sniffed. The tang of iron and copper filled my nostrils, and I coughed a little. Still, I couldn't take my eyes away.

No matter how hard I tried, my thoughts kept returning to one thing. Quickly, I put the packaging to my lips and tipped it back.

Sweet, mineral taste filled my mouth, thick clumps of it rolling across my tongue as the cold, congealed liquid slipped down my throat.

Snapping back to my senses, the metallic taste was still fresh on my tongue. I made to retch, horrified by what I’d just done.

But I felt fine, better than fine even.

I could have sworn that, for those few seconds, my thirst had ebbed away a little. Not gone, but a slight reprieve at least. It was short-lived, however, as when it came back, it came back hard. It felt like I’d been chewing sandpaper.

I couldn’t take it anymore. My flat felt too dry, too small. I needed air.

Maybe if I walked, it would go away. The thirst. It was stupid, but I was getting to the point where I would try anything to be rid of it.

Grabbing my coat and my earphones, I stepped out, climbing down the staircase and onto the street. I was half-scrolling on my phone when I rounded the corner…

He was in the road again, his stomach pressed flat to the ground as he frantically clawed underneath a parked car. The terrified hissing and yowling coming from beneath the vehicle scratched at my eardrums. They got louder and more panicked with each swipe of his hand.

I watched, frozen, the memory of the rat playing around in my head as he tried to work himself under the car. All of my senses seemed to drift away. I thought I heard an engine growl, birds tweeting overhead, but they were all muffled. I just stared at him, transfixed.

Without warning, the cat darted from its hiding place. The homeless man scrambled frantically to his feet in pursuit, grunting like a rabid animal.

A blaring horn ripped through the air. Screeching brakes. 

Then, a sickening crunch. A wet thump as his skull connected with the pavement.

He didn’t get back up.

The homeless man lay there, body crumpled and twitching, blood pooling from his head.

Everything seemed to fade away as I gawped at the scene. The sounds of a woman getting out of her car, the screams of other pedestrians, they were all a million miles away.

I should have been horrified, I should have rushed to him or dialled 999 or something. My phone was in my hand. All I had to do was press those three little numbers. 

But all I could do was stand there, entranced…

As I watched the blood slowly pool, soft ripples forming on its surface as he twitched, I could have sworn that for a second, I saw something writhing underneath. Tiny, sinuous shapes dancing in the dark. Beckoning me…

I couldn't help but salivate a little.

One thought pulsed in my mind. The words slipped out before I could stop them.

1nfxu2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/theotherwoman/comments/1nfxu2r/why_cant_he_let_me_go/,Why cant he let me go?,"I'm 26F and I had an short term ""affair"" or whatever you call it, with a 44MM in my previous workplace. I knew him since he's my college professor's son, and he holds a position in the department. Not gonna lie, I had a little crush on him before 'cause I really saw him as a respectable and loving husband and father to his family. I adored his image. He's also so nice to me but I swear it was just a crush as I was aware he is married.

Earlier this year, he messaged me to ask if I was resigning and told me that his mom wants him to talk to me about it. He mentioned that I was one of his mom's favorite students and that I should get some ""advice"" from him. I thought of it as a very kind gesture so I accepted the ""talk over coffee"" invitation.

It went really professional but I also noticed he's kind of flirting already, like he said that I was the only ""memorable"" face in our office because I was attractive. After that, he wanted to invite me to have a coffee date again before he leaves for the US where he got assigned.

Fast forward, he started sending flirty messages again. The naiveté in me thought we were just bantering. My friends know that I am this type of person to everyone, so it should not be a great deal that I'm replying back to his playful messages. Again, I know that he is married, so I was also setting boundaries during our whole conversation and assumed that he's just making fun of me.

Then one day, we went to lunch. He said it was still about my resignation, but he started to talk about his family. The classic ""my wife doesn't care about me anymore"" script. He even complained about his kids as a distraction from work, and the reason why he's not working from home even if he has the option to do so. He even complained about his mom (my prof), that she's not helping with the bills and she's just sleeping. He also shared about his past FWBs but he said they weren't really serious. He even had an affair before he got married and continued it after marriage. Then on our way back to the office, he began to lean on me and gave me a kiss. We made out. After that lunch out, I didn't message him because I felt guilty. There was guilt, remorse, and adrenaline rush. It was a roller coaster of emotions and it didn't really feel right especially with the rants and revelations I heard from him.

But maybe I was bored. Maybe it was because I was also leaving the Department. I still continued talking to him and it escalated into a physical relationship. I wasn't really attached from him from the very start; heck, I didn't even reach out to him every time we did it. I had walls. The thing is, it made him even more clingy to me. He always wanted see me. He sent numerous I miss you texts when I left.

Before he left the country, he drove to my new workplace which was 30 km away from his house. He said he wanted to see me one last time. Though, there was no intimate moment that time. He revealed to me that the coffee invite months ago was not really about my resignation. It was when he knew I had a crush on him and even before that, he really saw me as an attractive and ""hot"" woman. He even showed me the messages of his colleagues and friends who find me hot, and that gave him the urge to approach me. It's mainly an ego thing. That night, he even posted a story about me on his IG but I immediately told him to remove it. As soon as he arrived in the US, he sent me a long ass message where he said that I wasn't just an ""FWB"", that it was something else and it was painful to say good bye to me. 

Well, my emotionally distant self didn't respond to his long message. I am aware that it should end as he arrived in the US. But lo and behold, two months later and he still messages me. I know that he felt that I was backing off already, so he asked me if we could still be ""friends"". He now complains about the living costs in the US and his allowances are not enough to sustain his family's needs.

Right now, I still feel guilt and a little anger. I feel manipulated. It seems like his wife and him are okay, and what he told me were half truths. I even saw their fam picture earlier, they all look happy.

This brings me to my question: Why can't he just let me go? Find another supply. or focus on his family. I had several attempts of ghosting him and I'm gonna continue NC but he still finds a way.

Also, does his wife not suspect anything from him?",1,1757770973.0,theotherwoman,4,1.0,False

Lately I’ve been solo parenting quite often during my husbands work trips. Some of these trips have NOT been work trips. These aren’t solo vacations but his longest trips have not been work related and he DID get to do fun leisurely touristy things. I feel a lot of resentment. I haven’t spent a single night away from all of our children. He’s racked up over a month’s worth. On the flip, he’s never ever ever had to solo parent any number of our children on his own EVER. Certainly never over night. I just. Need. A break. I’m at my tipping point. 

We alternate mornings of who wakes with the kids. When I wake with the kids, I do everything I need to do for myself while they’re awake, in my vicinity etc so he’s not bothered. When he wakes with the kids, their diapers haven’t been changed by the time i get up and come downstairs, and he leaves them with me to go and use the bathroom, brush teeth, etc. it’s infuriating! Get that shit done when I’m sleeping in! I feel like I’m left in the lurch a lot. To be clear he’s not waking me with these tasks for the kids and then disappearing. He’s with them and leaving me to sleep in but, but not also getting the same things done that I get done. 

Today is my Saturday. It’s already been a struggle. He was out of town earlier this week and I solo parented. It was fine and uneventful but exhausting! Today he wants to take our older 2 to some local event. No mention of the baby. He assumes that “the baby will be napping”, so why include him. I’m frustrated because sure. Maybe the baby will nap 3 hours. OR maybe he’ll feel my eagerness for quiet time and wake up after napping 30 minutes. And then I’m in purgatory until my husband returns home with the older 2.  Because that’s usually what happens. 

I brought these frustrations up to him and it turned into a huge argument. He thinks I’m beating a dead horse and maybe I am, but like I keep asking for this shit. I keep doing things alone and I need a fucking break. After having three kids we’re just in a constant cycle of stress and exhaustion and we’re not getting along. I have a lot of resentment. I’m very angry. And even though I’m communicating my needs, it turns into a fight and isn’t a conversation. He’s pissed at me now. I’m upset and can’t even enjoy my fucking cup of coffee.

I've been using a Zassenhaus manual coffee grinder for my daily espresso needs which has been pretty decent. But as my partner is not fond of manual grinding and we're increasingly drinking filter coffee using frenchpress and/or moka, I'm considering getting an automatic grinder. Now, I'd also like to use it from time to time for my espresso which I know is a bit more difficult to get with budget automatic grinders.

I've found two used machines that cost the same (75€) and are both in very good condition: Gino Rossi RR45 v. a used Baratza Virtuoso+. I'm considering the former as it seems the better machine to handle the whole spectrum but I'm concerned that it's quite old (I think the specific model itself was made in '95!) but still in good functioning condition; also the owner has made a 3D printed funnel. The Baratza one seems as good as new but from what I've read it's a bit more difficult to grind very finely for espresso.

1nfxsbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MasterPCreviews/comments/1nfxsbz/should_you_buy_the_best_samsung_tablet_galaxy_tab/,Should You Buy the Best Samsung Tablet Galaxy Tab A9 Plus Bundle,"Using the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ has been a blend of utility and entertainment. I’ve been putting it through its paces over the last few weeks, and while it excels in many areas, there are a few quirks to note. Armed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 processor, 4GB RAM, and 64GB of storage (which can be expanded to 1TB), it delivers solid performance for everyday tasks. The sleek grey design, lightweight build, and bundled accessories like the trifold stand case and 64GB SD card make it an attractive package out of the box. From binge-watching shows to tackling work, this tablet feels like it’s trying really hard to be the all-rounder for both casual and productivity-focused users. 

**Highlighting The Vivid Display**

That 11-inch TFT LCD screen is easily one of the standout features. It offers a resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels, which doesn’t disappoint for watching movies or playing games. Even scrolling feels smoother thanks to the 90Hz refresh rate. The 480 nits brightness level isn’t groundbreaking, but I could still comfortably use it outdoors on a sunny day—even if I had to squint occasionally. Color reproduction is natural, and while it doesn’t match the OLED oomph of premium tablets, this display doesn’t feel like a compromise either.

[Looking for Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ deals? Check Amazon now.](https://ultimateprinter.com/p/b0dy6sb5x7/)

**Loving The Dolby Atmos Experience**

Audio immersion is another area where this tablet comes in strong. With quad speakers and Dolby Atmos support, sound is crisp and balanced. Watching blockbuster action movies felt genuinely cinematic, and music playback was surprisingly rich. High-volume playback didn’t lead to distortion, though the lower bass notes could use some punch. Whether I was in my room or traveling, I didn’t feel the need to connect external speakers.

**Everyday Usability and Build Quality**

Light and slim, the Galaxy Tab A9+ feels great in hand. I’ve taken it almost everywhere—on public transport, to my cousin’s house, and even to the park to multitask with emails while sipping coffee. The included case provides sturdy protection, and its minimalist design earned it compliments from friends. However, the slightly slippery surface sometimes made me nervous when holding it one-handed.

**Strengths**

- Rich 11-inch display with a 90Hz refresh rate.
- Quad speakers accentuated by Dolby Atmos provide excellent sound quality.
- Compact and lightweight, making it extremely portable.
- Bundled accessories save you time hunting for extras.
- Expandable storage capability up to 1TB.
- Seamless multitasking with the Multi-Window Display feature.

**Pitfalls**

- The screen struggles slightly in direct sunlight at full brightness.
- 4GB RAM feels limiting for intense multitasking.
- The bundled case, while functional, lacks premium longevity.
- No stylus support, which could be limiting for creative users.

**Comparing With Product Rivals**

When laid side by side with competitors like the Apple iPad Mini and Lenovo Tab P11, the Galaxy Tab A9+ holds its own in some respects. The Lenovo Tab P11 has a comparable screen size and stereo speakers, but it falls short in speed when subjected to heavy apps, where the tablet’s Snapdragon 695 processor shines. The iPad Mini, of course, dominates with superior app optimization and display vibrancy, but it’s considerably more expensive. What puts the Galaxy Tab A9+ in a sweet spot is the balance between performance, cost-effectiveness, and the inclusion of accessories like the case and SD card.

**Quality for Price**

This tablet aims to deliver affordable quality rather than luxury. While pricier tablets include OLED screens or more advanced processors, this device strikes a pleasant balance between performance and budget-friendliness. It’s clear Samsung wanted this to cater to students, families, and casual users who value accessibility and functionality over cutting-edge features. Expanding its storage with the included 64GB SD card was effortless, and having that capability up to 1TB makes it an investment worth considering.

Hey everyone! 🙏

I’m working on setting up a Discord server called Kolkata Adda – a chill space where Kolkatans can meet, chat, share memes, plan pandal hopping, talk about food, or just vibe together during Pujo and beyond.

Right now, the server is still under development, and I’d love to make it more than just another group chat. For that, I’m looking for:

Server Creator/Builder → someone experienced in Discord setups (channels, roles, bots, etc.) to help design the base.

Mods → to help manage channels and keep things fun & safe.

Creators → people who can bring ideas, memes, reels, contests, or even organize virtual addas.

Early members → who want to help shape the server culture from day one.


If you’ve ever wanted to be part of building an online community for Kolkatans (and Pujo lovers in general), this is the perfect chance! 🎉

Drop a comment or DM if you’re interested, and I’ll share the invite link. 🚀

P.S. Even if you don’t want to mod, feel free to join once it’s live – the goal is to make it feel like a real para’r adda online. 💬

Let’s get real for a second: are we seriously leaving money on the table while we sleepwalk through our content creation? 🤔 I mean, if you’re grinding away at your videos, blog posts, or even podcasts, and not thinking about how to tap into the golden opportunities that AI brings, then... *Yikes*!

I stumbled across a few strategies recently that had me thinking, ""Why didn’t I try this sooner?"" 💡 It’s like finding a hidden stash of cash in your couch cushions. Let’s jump into some AI monetization strategies that you can whip out like a content superhero!

### 1. **AI Content Creation Tools: Use Them Wisely!**
   - Ever heard of tools that will craft entire articles for you in minutes? 📜 AI writers can help you pump out quality content much faster. Instead of spending hours on a blog post, what if a bot did the heavy lifting for you? 
   - Just remember, have your own flair! Spice it up with personal anecdotes or a bit of humor. 

### 2. **Automate Your Social Media Marketing**
   - You know those dreaded hours spent scheduling posts? Use AI to find the best times to post and what content resonates with your audience. 
   - Ever tried reading analytics? It can feel like learning an alien language. With AI tools, you can decode that data and really focus your efforts. Imagine the likes and shares pouring in. 📈

### 3. **Personalized Content Delivery**
   - Have you ever received an email that felt like it was talking directly to you? That’s AI at work! Utilize it to customize emails, product recommendations, or tailored content that makes your audience feel special.
   - When you make them feel seen, you can bet they’ll hit that “buy” button faster than you can say *you’ve got mail*. 📬

### 4. **Affiliate Marketing Like a Pro**
   - Got a blog or a YouTube channel? Pair that content with affiliate links and let AI suggest products your audience will love. It’s like being the friend who knows all the best restaurants and can grab you a discount too! 
   - Seriously, why wouldn’t you want to make some extra cash while recommending your favorite tools? 

### 5. **Membership or Subscription Models**
   - What if you turned your audience into a VIP club? Share exclusive content, webinars, or resources and charge a small fee. (Kinda like your Netflix, but better!)
   - Using AI to personalize this experience can make your members feel like they’re really getting something special. 

### 6. **Don’t Overlook Passive Income Streams**
   - Think e-books or online courses. AI can help you curate content, figure out what people want, and even guide writing or structuring your materials! 
   - Why not turn your expertise into an ongoing source of income? 

The wild part? These aren’t just theories; I’ve seen folks implement them with great success! It’s like finding out you can effortlessly boost your income while drinking your morning coffee. ☕️ 

So, what’s holding you back from trying some of these strategies? Fear? Time? If everyone had all the answers figured out, we wouldn’t be in this community, right? Let’s keep pushing the envelope and share our experiences! 

What strategies are you already testing out, or which ones are you itching to try? Everyone’s looking for that *secret sauce*—and who knows, your comment might just reveal it! 🤑",1,1757770467.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

*Where the only thing more unpredictable than the scoreline is whether the players remember which team they’re on.*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Titans**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like a defensive midfielder crumbles under pressure. The decimal odds for **Manchester City** hover around **1.71–1.80**, implying a **55–58% chance of victory**. For **Manchester United**, the odds range from **4.1–4.4**, translating to a **20–23% implied probability**. The draw? A tidy **24–25%** (odds: 3.9–4.1). On paper, City’s dominance is as clear as a VAR replay… until it isn’t.

But here’s the rub: derbies are where logic takes a coffee break. City’s “controlled chaos” style, as described, sounds like a math teacher’s nightmare—*“I’ll let you all run wild, but please, somehow score goals.”* United, meanwhile, are a work in progress under Ruben Amorim, who’s trying to turn a team that lost a penalty shootout to Grimsby into title contenders. Spoiler: it’s not happening.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and the Ghost of Last Season**  
**Manchester City** are missing a veritable UN of key players: **Oumar Moussa**, **Ryan Sherke**, **Mateo Kovacic** (yes, *that* Kovacic, ex-Chelsea), and doubts over **Phil Foden** (the team’s Swiss Army knife). It’s like they packed their starting XI into a suitcase and forgot half of them. Their recent form? A 4-0 thrashing of Wolves, followed by a 2-0 home loss to Tottenham and a 1-2 away defeat to Brighton. Guardiola’s squad looks like a group of overqualified interns—everyone’s trying too hard, and the coffee table keeps getting kicked over.

**Manchester United**, on the other hand, are a club still haunted by the specter of last season’s collapse. They’ve lost **Lisandro Martinez** (their emotional anchor) and **Joshua Zirke** (who, honestly, was just there

1nfxmq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/attitudinalpsyche/comments/1nfxmq1/i_have_arrived_with_a_questionnaire/,i have arrived with a questionnaire,"i have the self-awareness to realize this is probably FLEV, but i'm still curious about subtypes and alternative ideas so here it is.

L

How much time and energy do you spend researching or studying? Do you like researching and studying, and why?
- i research a lot of things i get interested in and i can go fairly, but not incredibly deep into it. i have fixations, but i switch very very often, each one lasts about three weeks. there’s recurring fixations too, such as typology. id say im good at researching, but i only bust out researching skills when it’s needed, such as for academics or a project. however, if there’s a lack of knowledge and i need it to do something, i can also very quickly get a comprehensive (but not exhaustive) sense of what the thing is.

How many of your own opinions do you form? How often do you do actual thinking on your own, more than just finding an existing answer?
- i don’t form my own opinions too often, but sometimes i do have a clear opinion, it’s just a little difficult to justify it logically? i like hearing many different opinions and synthesizing them from an unaffected standpoint and i really take pride in my ability to do so. at times i would adopt a more argumentative persona for debates and discussions, but when a debate gets really opinionated or heated i beg off it. i’ve found im pretty good at rebuttals, that is, identifying the problems in someone else’s argument and alternatives. all my opinions definitely come from my own synthesis of other opinions though, and i wouldn’t want to just go with an opinion i’ve heard from someone else.

How often do you talk about concepts or facts? Why exactly do you talk about it, and what do you like talking about most?
- i talk about concepts fairly often, facts not so much. i have a deep skepticism that things can be truly, objectively true, and that’s why i don’t put much stock at all in the idea of attaining universal truths. in my head and through my own philosophical reflection, those aren’t a thing. i talk about concepts to other people because they interest me and i want them to interest other people too. also, that way i have someone to talk about my interests with. i like talking about lots of things, in fact i’m rather talkative when i’m have energy and am engaged, so that bit is harder to answer.

Do you struggle with thinking about things by yourself? Does this bother you, and how much? How well do you handle criticism from others when it comes to your logical concepts or factual knowledge?
- i don’t struggle with thinking about things by myself. usually my head is actually really empty, i have no internal monologue and when brainstorming there aren’t ideas bouncing off the walls of my cranium or something. could be aphantasia, could be something else. this bothers me not at all. when others criticise me by coming at me with their own opinion, i find it easy to dismantle theirs while also admitting some missed considerations in my own. when asked to give stronger basis for my own opinions and conclusions, though, i can sometimes struggle to answer and might abandon my position once i recognize the position had some faults without actually taking the time to reassess the good parts of my argument.

Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?
- it was a little bit time-taking and i felt like there were a few too many things crammed into one singular response, sometimes. i don’t feel positive or negative, in fact i think i feel a tiiiiiny bit positive? in terms of energy it definitely drained my brain a little bit, i put my whole head into answering a bit too fast.

E

Do you consider yourself a creative person? What do you do that's creative?
- i think i’m predisposed towards creativity, i can have really innovative ideas. however, it’s a bit more difficult for me to identify in exactly which areas i’ve been creative. i think when it comes, it comes, and it comes often when im looking for solutions or ways to spice up my work.

How do you feel about expressing your own emotions? Are emotions part of your decision-making at all? How much of a role do they play in your decisions?
- it’s a bit difficult to express my own emotions. on one hand, i’m often not very aware i’m even having emotions. on the other hand, i think that expressing them is a bit difficult, it takes time to disentangle how i’m doing emotionally and communicate that. on the other, other hand, i often think my own emotions are not worth other people’s attention and won’t gather other people’s attention either. there’s been times when this idea of mine has been disproven by those around me, and i can feel very touched in those moments. by that, i mean i start tearing up unexpectedly out of absolutely goddamn nowhere and it’s an embarrassment. still, it’s a bit ingrained in me that my emotions aren’t given a shit about, neither by me, nor those around me. as for decision-making, i think my emotions do come into play a little bit. if a decision is going to put continuous emotional pressure on me and i know i will break at some point, i wouldn’t opt for it. however, i’m not in touch with my emotions enough for them to be a decision-making tool.
- p.s. i'm probably deleting this post after i get some info from y'all because it has violent levels of reflection on the state of my emotional awareness

How much effort do you put into creating a positive emotional influence on other people? Do you try to do this at all? Do you like exploring the emotions or creativity of others?
- quite a bit. when i see people struggling with something, i’m very inclined to be a sounding board or a guide and help them sort things out in their head. this is given that i have the energy to do so, of course, but sometimes i push myself into doing it when i see that my therapist services are in need even if i have very little energy left. other people feel better, i get a sense of general satisfaction and positivity at having done something good. exploring the emotions or creativity of others is not so much my thing, though. i’m down to explore why they’re having certain emotions, where they came from, possibly even get into childhood traumas.

Do you feel uncomfortable with the idea of sharing your emotions? Do you struggle with knowing exactly how to connect with others on a deeper and more emotional level? Do you struggle with knowing how to go about dealing with and handling your emotions?
- i think i explained sharing emotions before. i do struggle understanding the concept of connecting to others on a deeper emotional level, but often times it just happens along the way in my closest (and i do mean Closest) relationships. i don’t struggle with dealing with or handling my emotions simply because they’re just not in my awareness the majority of the time. i get the feeling from seeing my more emotionally-afflicted friends that if they were, i wouldn’t be having a great time anymore, so i’m not inclined to explore or even “solve” the “issue” of my emotional apathy just yet.

Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?
- emotions are a difficult part of my identity in general. i used more of my energy answering these questions. i didn’t feel affected, but i did have to put to words some of the things i’ve thought about before in my head and it was a little iffy. this section will also explain why in other sections for the last question i don’t have much to say. i’m just not all that aware of how my emotions are emoting.

F

How much time and energy do you put into your physical health? Do you try new healthcare or self-care products often? How often, and what kinds of products do you like trying?
- i put some time into my physical health, but ultimately not a lot. i have a desire to be fit, but i’m not consistent on exercising or maintaining a routine, so i exercise on occasion whenever i get the urge. the end result is that i stay at a healthy weight. however, whenever i’m having a volatile time emotionally, i would exercise as a way to get the frustration out. i try out new healthcare products on occasion, and if there’s anything that works well i’d incorporate it into my routine. usually this just means finding a good facial cleanser, or something small. however, i’m very inconsistent about using self-care products and i have absolutely zero routine whatsoever. i don’t use makeup products. i think a big reason i’ve never done makeup despite some mild interest is that it feels bad on my skin. foundation feels like absolute and utter shit. sunscreen too, it was genuinely the bane of my existence when i lived in a city that was at a really high altitude and had to deal with uv rays.

How much do you care about your physical appearance, including fashion choices, or decorating the physical environment for comfort? Do you like exploring the physical environment (food, nature, architecture, etc), or doing physical activity?
- i care about looking generally kind of stylish? but i don’t go out of my way into fashion. i’d just try and match things up deliberately a little bit. even when i’m just going outside to toss the trash in a t-shirt and sweats, i’d try to pick out something that’s both comfortable and styled. i don’t decorate my physical environment, in fact i’ve very lax with it. whenever i have a large bed, i’d just put items i’d use often during the day on one side of the bed and sleep on the other. however, i have specific sort of taste for what my preferred house would look like, the decoration, especially the vibes. i think i’m very neutral to my physical environment. i like trying food, but it’s a bit difficult because you have to just choose one dish and you can’t try them all to see which ones are good and which ones aren’t when you’re on a budget. i’m actually kind of jealous of depictions of rich people just ordering the whole menu because then you’re not obligated to finish your food at all, you can just pick and choose whatever you find you prefer. i have a strong sense of aesthetics that kind of comes out in photography. nature and architecture are meh on their own, but sometimes a certain scenery kind of fits really well in my eyes. i think the term of it is that i have a good sense of composition? something like that. i described physical activity earlier, but when it comes to sports it’s also a bit complicated. i’m lazy and i haven’t been in one specific sport for much time, but whenever i get pushed into doing physical activity i often end up really, really enjoying it. however, even that isn’t enough to get me to go for it in place of just laying around and chilling out.

Do you like talking about your personal tastes often? How often do you explore the personal tastes of others? What about your own health or the health of others? Do you like creating or exploring comfortable environments with others?
- i don’t know, what counts as personal taste? i can deal with a wide range of things and i have some specific things that i like, i guess. for example, i have literally never found a satisfactory regular drink order. every single drink is just insufficient in some way, even when its good. still, i can cope with a lot of iffyness. even when my coffee is sour up to the goddamn, i can drink it, and i won’t even feel that upset. i think i don’t talk about my personal tastes often, such as with my drink order (i’ve never put that into words before, actually), because as with emotions it’s something i expect myself and others not to give a shit about. i take note of the personal tastes of others somewhat, but not all too much. i’m actually a little confused what that even entails. similarly, i don’t think i’m good at creating a comfortable environment for others. a lot of times the people around me take the initiative to create a comfortable environment for themselves. if this intrudes upon my own comfort, i can feel very frustrated but i ultimately won’t react until it gets really unbearable. as an example, i prefer sleeping with the lights off but a former roommate preferred them on. in that case, i used my sleeping mask, but one week it went missing and then i was Really suffering.  genuinely so frustrated at them i could cry. didn’t say anything confrontational, though, because as with my emotions, i have a hard time voicing my preferences.

Do you stress about what people will think regarding your personal tastes? Do you prefer to follow fashion trends in worry that people may judge your own style? Do you worry about being sick or in poor physical health often? Are you able to take criticism about your health, aesthetic choices, personal tastes, or physical appearance?
- no. just, no. even when my tastes are really weird and i know people would think they’re really weird, i don’t care and i don’t show them. no fashion trends either, but i do try to style my outfits a little because i like looking nice. i don’t worry about being sick, but whenever i notice i feel sick i’d be extra careful with myself and find ways to mitigate my discomfort. i take criticism about health/aesthetics/tastes/appearance with minimal grace, but i try not to make my annoyance at the criticism evident.

Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?
- i actually ended up putting to words lots of things i never realized were part of physics. it was interesting to explore this part of myself.

V

Do you know how to get what you want? How much effort do you put into figuring out how to get what you want? Do you just take action and get started, do you plan, do you research or try to get advice from others?
- i honestly don’t know what i want a lot of the time and i’m okay with dealing with whatever comes. i put minimal effort into getting what i want. if there’s too much resistance, i settle. if it’s still possible and i also have the energy to give a shit, i would make a bit more of an attempt. i tend to research a lot before getting started, partially to learn more, partially to avoid getting started. advice from others is okay, but not really asked for. i’m realizing as i write this that it’s fucking incredible i ever gaslit myself into thinking i’m 1V.

How often do you feel motivated to work on your future? How often are you busy working on a goal for the future? Do you prefer routine, or often fall into routine? Is your routine making progress on a goal? What makes you change your routine? What makes you start working on a goal?
- not often. not often. i don’t do routine at all, but i think it could really benefit me to implement a routine. still, that requires a push from the outside, and i don’t have that right now. my routine does not make progress on a goal, i live generally to be satisfied and happy whenever i can find satisfaction and happiness. i start working on a goal when it’s too late not to work.

Do you like guiding or helping people reach their goals? What kinds of goals do you prefer to help people with? Are you a leader, or do you prefer to work in groups where you're an equal? How and when do you take charge, if ever?
- i like guiding and helping other people, but not necessarily to reach their goals, i leave that bit up to them once i’ve supported them in sorting out something else. i prefer to work as a valued member of a group, but if leadership is really shit or really scarce, i could take over. i’m not the most inspiring leader, though, and i could fall into a trap of trying to micromanage everyone a little bit while also being bad at micromanaging when it’s a long project. other times i might take charge because there’s some idea or concept i’m interested in expounding on, or i’m very suited for the role in terms of expertise or vision. when i am a leader, i think i don’t actually feel very bad, just a bit awkward when i have to lead and otherwise neutral and focused on the objective.

Do you overwork yourself? Do you worry that you might be lazy or that you aren't progressing quickly enough? Does it feel impossible to find the right method forward? Are you able to take criticism over your choices for working towards your goals? How do you respond to being challenged?
- i sometimes overwork myself by concentrating too much work in a short time period, but i don’t relate to the regular definition of overworking. people who don’t know me well can think i’m a very diligent person who overworks myself because i often produce good results, which was just incredible to me the first time i found out this was how some people saw me. i do acknowledge my procrastination and i can get very worried about its consequences, but i struggle to worry that i’m procrastinating. it’s weird. in fact, i've only managed to complete this questionnaire because im procrastinating another task by doing this. it doesn’t feel impossible to find the right way forward, in fact i think there’s lot of solutions and i’m willing to be the one to get to finding them. i can take criticism for my procrastination and minimal ambition because…it’s true. when i’m challenged i react pretty calmly to the challenge and to completing it.

Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?
- by this point i’m getting very tired of answering there questions. i realized by answering these that there was no way in hell i was 1V and it’s amazing i ever gaslit myself into that.

1nfxlt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedAndRated/comments/1nfxlt8/should_you_buy_the_best_electric_kettle_fellow/,Should You Buy the Best Electric Kettle Fellow Corvo EKG Pro,"Testing the Fellow 1171PRO-MB Electric Kettle over the past few weeks has been an interesting experience, to say the least. As someone who enjoys a meticulously brewed cup of tea in the evening and a perfectly steeped pour-over coffee every morning, I found myself interacting with this sleek gadget more than I anticipated. At first glance, it doesn’t just whisper ""premium""; it practically shouts it—with that chic matte black finish and thoughtfully engineered design. Yet, while I’ve been mostly impressed, a few quirks stopped me from giving it a perfect pass.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This electric kettle turns heads, no doubt about it. The matte black finish feels modern and unobtrusive, seamlessly blending into the aesthetic of my kitchen counter. It’s not a product you need to tuck away in a cabinet when guests come over. Crafted from 304 stainless steel, it has the reassuring weight that screams durability, while the food-grade silicone components add a softer, approachable touch to this robust frame. The ergonomic handle is a win, fitting so naturally in my hand that filling a cup feels effortless. Even the lid pull feels thoughtfully designed. However, I quickly discovered that the kettle, while stunning, is not immune to fingerprints. Smudges tend to gather on the matte surface quicker than you can say “tea time,” so I’ve taken to wiping it down regularly—something worth noting if you’re as particular about clean aesthetics as I am.

**Performance for the Precision Enthusiast**  
This kettle doesn’t just heat water; it treats it like a science. The to-the-degree temperature control is genuinely next-level. Whether you need 180°F for a green tea or a hotter 205°F for French press, the Corvo EKG Pro adjusts precisely, which ensures the perfect brew every time. And I mean, every single time. My mornings used to involve second-guessing the water temperature and inevitably ending up with tea that tasted off. Those days are officially behind me. One of my favorite features is the built-in brew timer, which I didn’t realize I’d love until I found myself using it daily. There’s even a Guide Mode for selecting preset temperatures for coffee and tea types—a total game-changer for someone prone to over-steeping.  
[Check Fellow 1171PRO-MB price on Amazon.](https://kepmad.com/p/b0bz59157h/)

**Ease of Use and Customization**  
The high-resolution LCD screen is what initially caught my attention. It presents an intuitive interface where everything from scheduling your boil to adjusting the clock is at your fingertips. And yes, you can even set a chime to alert you when the water’s ready—though I’ve primarily kept mine on silent, thanks to my early morning routine when no one wants to hear shrill dings. You can dive into Hold Mode for instances when you want the temperature to stay consistent for up to an hour, perfect for those moments when I forget my tea while chasing after my dog. This personalization fits well into various routines, allowing you to tweak settings to match your brewing preferences.

**Good Points**  
- Flexible to-the-degree temperature control for precision  
- Sleek looks with a durable build  
- Ergonomic design and smooth pour spout  
- Convenient Guide Mode and onboard brew timer  
- Superb user customization via adjustable settings  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Matte finish picks up smudges easily  
- Premium features come at a luxury price tag  
- Occasional learning curve for accessing all advanced settings

**Competitors in Perspective**  
Holding the Fellow kettle against other electric kettles, the differences are stark. Compared to the reliable but more basic Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle, the Fellow outshines with features like altitude adjustments, WiFi firmware updates, and tailored temperature presets. Of course, the price point is highly reflective of these added perks, something not everyone may be willing to pay. On the other hand, the Breville Smart Kettle allows for preset temperatures and has a sturdier traditional build, but its control interface lacks the clean, modern edge and customization that the Fellow model brings. The ergonomics and overall balance of this kettle during a pour also feel more refined versus the Breville, where style meets function rather than prioritizing one over the other.

**Quality for Price**  
This is where things get tricky. It’s undeniable that this electric kettle is more of an investment than just a standard purchase. But personally, I’d argue that if you truly value brewing precision and enjoy your tea or coffee rituals, its elevated performance justifies the expense. For casual users, though, paying for advanced features like WiFi firmware updates and a full-color display might seem excessive. That said, it’s the kind of tool that feels worth every penny if its features complement your lifestyle.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **West Ham vs. Tottenham: A London Derby of Injuries, Late Drama, and Questionable Socks**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a Premier League clash that’s equal parts “rollercoaster of emotions” and “why did I bet on this?!” West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur collide at the London Stadium, where the air will be thick with tension, the roar of the crowd will sound like a disgruntled washing machine, and the outcome hinges on whether anyone remembers to tie their shoelaces. Let’s break it down.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Ask For

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind Tottenham, who sit at **+200 odds** (implied probability: \~47.6%) to win, while West Ham is a **+333 underdog** (\~29.4%). The draw? A tidy 3.5 (\~28%), which is about the same chance as your local barista remembering your coffee order. On paper, Tottenham’s edge makes sense: they’ve beaten Burnley and *Manchester City* this season, while West Ham’s recent form reads like a toddler’s scribbles—three losses, then a last-minute 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest.

But here’s the rub: Tottenham’s “A-team” is currently playing a game of musical chairs. Key attackers **James Maddison** and **Dejan Kulusevski** are sidelined, while **Lucas Digne** and **Radu Dragusin** are nursing injuries. It’s like showing up to a concert and realizing the lead singer forgot their voice. West Ham, meanwhile, is missing **Luis Guilherme** (broken collarbone—how does that even happen?!) but has **Crysencio Summerville** back in training. If Summerville’s return is as explosive as a dodgy microwave, West Ham might just shock the world.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, New Managers, and a Former Chef

Tottenham’s new manager, **Thomas Frank**, is already fielding questions about whether his “summer signings will save us or not?” Spoiler: They won’t. **Xavi Simons** and **Randal Kolo Muani** are flashy additions, but without Maddison and Kulusevski, Tottenham’s attack is like a smartphone with no apps—expensive, but useless. Their recent 0-1 loss to Bournemouth? A reminder that even 10-man teams can’t score if they’re too

What it means to be perfect at anything? Now what if that thing you were perfect at was being a hero? 

Real quick, what do you think the perfect hero is? 

I'm reminded of Spider-Man from Across the Spiderverse where Miles insists ""Spider-Man always does both."" Both being save the people and stop the villain. Spider-Man can do both, no matter what anyone tells him. Or something we believe he can.

Superman is another one that comes to mind. Yeah he fights monsters and alien gods, but he also stops by to talk to the average citizen. He understands them. 

But, are both of these people perfect? They've both made mistakes, can someone who makes mistakes truly very perfect?

So back to Lin Ling. He is brought to the mindset of perfection. Firm Man and Miss J make it clear that whatever the fans want you to be you become. They want Lin Ling to be the perfect Nice? Even when Nice wasn't perfect? Well, he's gonna be perfect then. And there's a scene not many people talk about that shows how crazy being ""perfect"" would actually be.

When he's talking to Miss J about Firm Man, the camera switches views...

And Lin Ling moves a coffee cup to the middle of **OUR** point of view, then even adjusts it so the logo is centered, for us.

How in the FUCK would a regular ass hero know where our point of view is? 

Then when he is fighting wolf girl and his old boss, he *completely* understands where they're coming from. He doesn't insult them or try to kill them, either. He tries to *talk* to them first, or he listens. He straight up tells the boss ""you need to calm down"" after batting him into the ground like nothing. Remember how everyone else has treated fear infected individuals? Lin Ling was the only one to try and help them. Everyone else just went straight hands. 

I think during his time as Nice, Lin Ling saw what being *perfect* means. Then, after his encounter with The God Eye, he went back to seeing the world as a regular human. 

Except, he *knows* what perfect looks like. He knows what everyone can be if they just believe in themselves. He knows that people can move past fear and trust if they just have that 01 trust and its in *themselves*. 

It's like, for a moment, a regular man became a god. Like an all knowing, kind, and loving god. Maybe not the power and presence of a god, but the understanding and knowledge of one? But then he was brought back down to human level and was like ""Guys wait, it's really this simple, watch."" To all the other common folk. 

Then, as a regular man, what phrase sticks with him the most to reach this goal? ""Keep fighting"", which I think fucking great. Imagining someone seeing that in themselves for the sake of the people is just so good. Not to mention this was a dude who was literally a STEP away from ending his own life. So so good. 

Idk, I love him. And I'm on the E-Soul episode run now and I'm getting very similar vibes of a nobody getting all the power but going a totally different route when he finally trusts himself. Which I think is just as compelling and deep of a story, if not more so. ",3,1757769741.0,ToBeHero_X,1,1.0,False

1nfx7nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1nfx7nc/explore_if_the_best_over_the_range_microwave/,Explore if the best over the range microwave Samsung ME11A7510DS truly delivers,"It’s been about three months since I installed the Samsung ME11A7510DS in my kitchen, and it’s safe to say this microwave has become both a handy and stylish companion in my daily cooking adventures. With a low-profile, over-the-range design, it checks the box for form and function in one compact silhouette. I mean, let’s be real—nobody likes a clunky appliance stealing counter space, and this microwave really gets that memo. But there are a few quirks worth discussing, so let's dive into the specifics.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The sleek stainless steel finish is the first thing you'll notice, giving off that “modern kitchen vibe” without being too loud about it. Fingerprint resistance is a big win for anyone like me who has kids or loves to cook but hates spending hours wiping down smudges. At 29 inches wide and 9 inches tall, it snugly fits over the range without feeling overpowering. Even better is the slim design—it effortlessly blends into a compact kitchen setup like mine, while still maintaining sufficient interior space.

**Highlighting Its Strengths**  
- The [ceramic enamel interior](https://mgplab.com/p/b09yn1dgq1/) makes cleaning spills and splatters surprisingly easy.  
- It's equipped with Wi-Fi and voice control, and yes, it integrates with smart home assistants. I asked it to reheat my coffee the other day while folding laundry, and it felt like I was living in the future.  
- The 400 CFM hood ventilation works exceptionally well. My partner pan-fried bacon last weekend, and this thing worked overtime to trap airborne grease and smells.  

**Cooking Performance That Stands Out**  
Cooking performance is where this microwave really shines. With 10 power levels, I found it easy to tackle everything from reheating leftovers to cooking more delicate items like fish or steaming veggies. The 1.1 cubic feet capacity might sound a bit limited on paper, but in practice, it can comfortably warm up plates or medium-sized casseroles, making it a perfect match for small families. Quick tip: Use the Auto Defrost feature—it’s a lifesaver when you forget to thaw chicken for dinner. The 1000 watts of power ensures food heats evenly without those annoying hot and cold spots. 

**Negatives That Can't Be Ignored**  
- The control panel isn’t backlit, which can be frustrating during late-night snacking adventures, especially in dimly lit kitchens.  
- While the installation itself was straightforward for the most part, mounting it over the range felt like I was solving a complex jigsaw puzzle. It’s not impossible, but expect to wrestle with it for a while if you're doing it alone.  
- I also noticed the sound of the fan is louder than expected—thankfully, it’s not an everyday dealbreaker, but worth mentioning.  

**Alternative Offerings on the Market**  
When stacked against its competitors like the Whirlpool WML75011HZ or the GE JVM6175SKSS, the Samsung ME11A7510DS holds its ground well. Its main advantage lies in advanced features like voice control and slim design, which the others don’t really offer in this price bracket. However, Whirlpool’s fingerprint-resistant material feels slightly more durable, whereas GE tends to shine in fan functionality. Still, Samsung nails it with its modern tech additions, making it an ideal choice for smart home users like me.

**True Value for Its Features**  
While I’m not going to sugarcoat the fact that this microwave leans on the pricier side of the spectrum for compact, over-the-range models, the overall value is undeniable. The combination of sleek design, dependable performance, and smart capabilities makes it feel like an investment that pays you back in convenience. It’s not perfect, but then again, what is? For anyone balancing function with a touch of contemporary design in their kitchen, this product deserves a second look.

[Check Samsung ME11A7510DS price on Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b09yn1dgq1/)

**Final Thoughts? Just Buy It? Maybe.**  
Your buying decision largely depends on what you value most in a microwave. This one excels in aesthetic appeal, performance, and smart features, but some subtle design choices aren’t for everyone. You are here reading this review, so that already indicates curiosity—and possibly even intent. So, if you value time-saving smart functions and robust air filtering, it’ll make a solid addition to your kitchen.

1nfx7hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1nfx7hu/post_trip_reflection_australia_10_days_with_32l/,Post trip reflection: Australia 10 days with 32L One Bag,"So here I am, back home after 10 days Canberra and Sydney trip; a government business meeting in Canberra-the main purpose of the  trip, then 3 days sightseeing in Sydney.

From Delhi, India, > Bangalore> Sydney> Canberra by Qantas. ~~32L~~ (correction: the bag is only 30L) decathlon bag was perfect; I missed Sydney Canberra flight but no issues as Qantas link put me on the next flight. No checked-in bag was a big help! Sydney to Canberra was a small twin propeller flight, and my 7 kg OneBag was a huge advantage for this leg. I had 32 kg checked luggage allowance anyway for all flights in this trip, but I didn't use it at all.

TIL that Qantas serve booze and snacks in domestic flights. I opted for Chilled Shiraz with Gourmet dry fruits, which was absolutely nice. 5 star service!

Qantas QF69 didn't weigh my cabin bag, and I saw many with two big bags (Big Backpack plus wheeler). Anyway, I will not take that risk anytime.

Having just a backpack ( My bag that I previously reviewed here is this https://www.decathlon.in/p/8844394/hiking-backpack-30l-nh-arpenaz-500) and no check-in bag was no probs at Sydney airport customs/quarantine (I was reading another post in this sub sharing why this could backfire/induce sus). Quarantine was a cakewalk despite carrying protein powders (but in factory sealed sachets) and medicines (in original foil, with prescriptions).in my OneBag.

I stuck with Uniqlo for my dress: A dark grey airsense trousers (my go-to OneBag trousers), a white no-iron dress shirt, and Black Airsense jacket. Absolutely fine with meetings and the Gala dinner. Outside the meeting, I wore a pufftech jacket for extra warmth (CBR is still moving slowly into Spring from Winter).

In Sydney, I wore a black DryEx Oversized T with a Dark Grey DryEx UV hoodie zip open like a jacket, perfectly fine for super long walks like Bondi\_Coogie.

My OneShoe was all black Terrex AX4 and it was absolutely fine. Just before super formal gala dinner, i deeply cleaned with a super wet towel, so it looked intensely black for a while :-) Obviously AX4 is NOT at all the shoe i would normally wear for such occasions, but then hey, I was OneBagging!

My daypack was Uniqlo again: black multi-pocket shoulder bag (which is like a large 13L sling). It is large enough for two bottles (water and cofffee), a tablet, an extra rainshell etc. Pretty urban street-smart style, and presentable in formal meeting situations. I wore it for Ainslie Peak hike in Canberra (The Highest peak in CBR!) and in the Bondi-Coogie walk in Sydney; it was perfectly fine, no pain in the shoulders, etc. This bag is also water resistant to a moderate level, another advt. The coffee mug i have is 400ml IKEA with a round yellow press-down lever at the top [https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/undersoeka-insulated-travel-mug-black-50497272/](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/undersoeka-insulated-travel-mug-black-50497272/) Two such mugs easily fits in the side bottle cages of UQ shoulder bag. Even 800ml decathlon ecozen flip top bottle fits fine. I carried additional 500 ml soft flask Decathlon Kalenji. The bag itself weighs only about 280g. 

I carried a packable duffel 40L for souvenirs in case I wanted. That was a huge mistake. I bought so many souvenirs from Sydney, including a 5 cup rice cooker (14 AUD at KMart is like a deal I should not miss!) and a few Shiraz bottles (I know, huge mistake!). So my return journey was really hellish. I lugged around 3 awkwardly placed bags on my shoulder; fully packed backpack plus packed uniqlo shoulder bag plus this 40L fully packed duffel. I would check in both backpack and duffel. Checking those isn't an issue, as my return was direct aboard Air India 12.5 hrs Sydney to delhi flight. The Air India flight was super bad; no entertainment working, toilets were so dirty and wet and soiled tissues everywhere. Anyway, landed safe and in time, that is what it matters most.

The combined weight of these three bags was 18 kg, again not so much, but then 18 kg in a large ergonomic backpack would have been infinitely more comfy than this arrangement. In Delhi, I would lug around these three bags, and I would hate OneBagging or this souvenir arrangement. Perhaps it would have been better off had I packed a smaller wheeled suitcase instead. Anyway, shit happens.

Australia was a love. Absolutely loved the place. Sydney is a brilliantly designed city with excellent public transportation, and I found Australians very nice. Would definitely go back, perhaps next time to Cairns to explore GBR.

Uniqlo, Ikea, Deacthlon. Love this combo for a globe trotter!",9,1757769250.0,onebag,0,0.91,False

CarMart Perth Moves from Bedford to Bustling East Victoria Park – Now Rubbing Shoulders with Industry Legend John Hughes

Award-Winning Family Team Brings Their Used Car Finance Expertise to the Heart of Perth’s Automotive Hub

EAST VICTORIA PARK, WA – CarMart Perth has officially moved from its long-time home in Bedford to a high-profile new location on Albany Highway in East Victoria Park, putting the family-owned dealership right in the heart of Perth’s busiest automotive corridor.

The move places CarMart Perth alongside established industry names — including John Hughes, a dealer Maurice describes as his “absolute idol” and a Perth automotive institution.

Experienced Industry Leaders (about us)

CarMart Perth is co-owned by John and Maurice, who each bring over 15 years of experience in automotive sales and finance. Both are decorated industry professionals:
	•	Maurice rose from Top 10 nationally in sales at AHG, to Top 5 the following year, and ultimately became #1 in Australia.
	•	John has won multiple Finance Broker of the Year awards and consistently ranked in the national Top 5 for finance brokers.

“Being on the same strip as legends like John Hughes is incredibly inspiring,” said Maurice. “I’d love nothing more than to sit down with him over a coffee and learn from his stories.”

Industry-Wide Respect

CarMart Perth has earned trust not only from customers but also from peers in the industry. Competing dealers regularly call John and Maurice for advice on pricing and finance — knowing they’ll get straight, honest answers.

“We get calls daily from other dealerships,” said John. “That level of respect shows how we’ve built a reputation on honesty and transparency.”

Expertise in Complex Finance Solutions

CarMart Perth is known for saying “yes” when others say “no”. Their specialty is finding finance solutions for customers who may have been turned away elsewhere:
	•	Bad Credit Car Loans – tailored solutions for poor credit history
	•	Bankruptcy Recovery Finance – helping people rebuild after financial hardship
	•	No Deposit Options – enabling customers to get moving sooner
	•	Flexible Repayment Plans – adjusted to fit real-life budgets
	•	Fast Approvals – because reliable transport is often urgently needed

Quality Vehicles, Local Trust

Every vehicle sold by CarMart Perth is personally selected, mechanically inspected, and backed by warranty options of up to 5 years. The dealership prides itself on supplying reliable cars that Perth families can depend on.

“Every time we get a customer back on the road, we’re helping a Perth family get to work, get kids to school, and regain independence,” said John.

Community Focus

CarMart Perth’s commitment extends beyond vehicles:
	•	Financial counselling support through local partners
	•	Affordable service plans to keep cars running reliably
	•	Community partnerships with employers and support services
	•	Transparent pricing with no hidden surprises

About CarMart Perth

Founded in September 2023, CarMart Perth has quickly become a trusted name for Perth families needing reliable cars and finance solutions. Now based at 707 Albany Highway, East Victoria Park, John and Maurice continue to deliver mates-rates prices, honesty, and a commitment to helping everyday Aussies — regardless of credit history — get back on the road.

1nfx55z,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1nfx55z/assess_the_best_countertop_dishwasher_hava_tdqr/,Assess the Best Countertop Dishwasher HAVA TDQR Worth Buying,"Dishwashers are supposed to make life easier, not add to it. Having tested the HAVA TDQR for a few weeks, I’ll admit it’s a pretty impressive little powerhouse. Whether you’re short on space or simply need a more convenient solution than battling piles of dishes, it seems custom-built for small households, RV enthusiasts, or those of us with zero patience for dishwashing duty.

**Compact Design That Packs More Than Expected**  
The countertop-sized unit is remarkably compact, measuring 16.8 x 16.9 by 18.1 inches, yet manages to hold a surprising amount of dishes. I was skeptical, but my family of three had no problem fitting up to 30 items inside, including my embarrassingly oversized coffee mugs. If you angle plates of up to 11 inches just right, they easily fit, and the layout is thoughtfully designed with a dedicated tray and cutlery holder. This appliance doesn’t just save space; it shows some serious organizational savvy.  

[Ready to buy HAVA TDQR? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b0915x4bbp/)

**No Installation? Sold!**  
There’s something liberating about a dishwasher that doesn’t demand installation drama. It offers two water-supply options: connect it to a faucet with the 61-inch hose provided or use the built-in 5-liter water tank. For everyday convenience, I’ve taken to filling up the tank instead of hunting down adapters for my aged kitchen faucet. If you’re living in a small apartment like me or enjoy hitting the road in an RV, this feature is golden. Why should a dishwasher dictate where you can live or park?

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact yet spacious interior allows you to fit more than you’d expect.  
- Dual water-supply options provide unmatched flexibility.  
- Operates quietly compared to traditional countertop models.  

**Six Washing Modes to Suit Any Scenario**  
This gadget comes with six program options: Normal, Speed, Soft, Heavy/Baby Care, Fruit, and Dry. My favorite? Heavy/Baby Care mode, which blasts dishes at a steamy 167°F. It’s a godsend for cleaning greasy pots or prepping baby bottles for my nephew when I babysit. There’s also a nifty fruit-cleaning mode, which as strange as it sounds, was pretty effective when I tested it on a batch of apples. The drying feature tacks on 72 hours of automatic ventilation to keep dishes odor-free, which is perfect—I hate that weird damp smell you sometimes get with compact dishwashers.

**Cons Worth Mentioning**  
- Filling the water tank manually can get annoying after consecutive washes.  
- Larger dinner plates don’t always fit without placing them at an awkward angle.  
- LED display lacks any smart-connect feature like Wi-Fi compatibility.  

**Energy Efficiency That Saves More Than Water**  
The selling point here is the 5-liter water consumption per cycle. It uses only a quarter of the water I’d normally spend on handwashing thanks to dual spray arms that provide 360-degree cleaning. Operating at 950 watts, it’s noticeably energy-efficient as well, which I appreciate, given how high electricity costs have gotten. Just don’t forget to use dishwasher-safe detergents for best results—pods, liquids, and even powders seem to work without a hiccup.  

**Rival Brands**  
Now, before swinging for the TDQR, I looked at other countertop portable models, and the main competitor was the Farberware FDW05ASBWHA. While the Farberware model offers an equally compact design and similar cleaning modes, it lags behind in terms of tank capacity (4 liters versus HAVA’s 5 liters). Additionally, HAVA’s drying function is more advanced, preventing the dreaded leftover moisture issue that Farberware units often struggle with. However, to be fair, the Farberware version has a sleeker touch-control display, which is where HAVA’s more button-based panel might feel a tad outdated.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Is the TDQR worth the investment? Absolutely, if you’re prioritizing convenience, efficiency, and portability. While alternatives may clock in at a slightly lower initial cost, they often lack the versatility or energy-saving features this dishwasher provides. It works efficiently enough to save on water bills, and considering it’ll likely pay for itself over time with convenient usage, it feels like you’re getting your money’s worth.

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Unless They’re Eyüpspor’s Chances)**  
Galatasaray is the statistical piñata here, and the bookmakers are handing out the sticks. The odds paint a clear picture: **Galatasaray is a 1.32 favorite** (implied probability: \~76%), while Eyüpspor is a 8.0 underdog (12.5%). The draw? A meager 4.8-5.1% chance, which is about as likely as a Turkish coffee breaking its surface tension and flowing backward. The spread favors Galatasaray by 1.5 goals, and the total goals line sits at 3.25. Given Galatasaray’s recent **18 goals scored in six games and just 1 conceded**, betting on a “Under” feels like betting your grandma’s cat won’t knock over a vase this week—possible, but not advisable.

**Digest the News: Injuries, New Faces, and a Former Ghost**  
Galatasaray’s star striker **Victor Osimhen** is out with a “moderate ankle ligament strain and bleeding,” which sounds less like a sports injury and more like a tragic opera. Without him, the offense still looks like a five-star restaurant—newcomers **Uğurcan Çakır** and **İlkay Gündoğan** are primed to debut, while **Barış Alper Yılmaz** returns from mental health concerns. Kudos to the club for prioritizing well-being, but let’s just say Eyüpspor’s defense better hope Yılmaz is still sipping chamomile tea.

Eyüpspor, meanwhile, sits in 10th place with a 1-1-2 record, which is soccer’s version of a D-minus in a class you forgot you were enrolled in. Their lineup includes players named **Claro**, **Mujakic**, and **Thiam**—names that sound like they belong in

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Samsunspor vs. Antalyaspor: A Tale of Two Turkeys (But One Likely Winner)**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a Süper Lig clash that’s as predictable as a Turkish coffee’s bitterness—Samsunspor, the home underlords, are here to remind Antalyaspor why they’ve dominated this rivalry like a dad jokes at a family dinner. Let’s parse the chaos.

---

### Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem

The bookmakers are practically screaming, “Bet on Samsunspor!” Their decimal odds of \~1.62 imply a **61.7% chance** of victory, while Antalyaspor’s +500 odds (5.0) suggest they’re as likely to win as your chances of finding a parking spot in Istanbul during Ramadan. The draw? A 28% “safe bet” for those who live on the edge.

The spread line (-0.75 for Samsunspor) demands they win by *at least two goals* to cover, which feels harsher than a Black Sea winter wind. Meanwhile, the total goals line sits at **2.25**, with “Under” favored. Translation: Expect a tactical masterclass, not a fireworks show.

---

### Digest the News: Form, History, and the Ghost of Erdoğan Arıca

Samsunspor enters this match on a **three-game unbeaten streak** (2 wins, 1 draw), including a gritty 1-point victory last week. They’ve also gone five consecutive Süper Lig matches without losing to Antalyaspor, a run that dates back to the days when Erdoğan Arıca’s magic kept them unbeaten for nine games in 2003-04. Fun fact: That era predates smartphones, yet somehow their defense was tighter than a solo by Erdem Kınay.

Antalyaspor, under the young maestro Emre Belözoğlu, just pulled off a gritty road win over Karagümrük. But let’s not get carried away—Belözoğlu’s side hasn’t secured three straight wins, and their attack looks like a slow coo

# Saturday reading: Mini-decisions lead to maxi-decisions

Few relapses are intentional. The stated intent of all people trying to change is to take actions and to maintain their progress until they are free of their problem. But it is easy to fool ourselves. We may make any number of “mini-decisions” that ultimately have negative consequences… Some such decisions might include keeping extra servings of current-risk binge foods in the house “in case company drops by” or deciding to go for coffee or a walk (healthy activities on their own) in a high-risk business or neighbourhood instead of doing the same thing in a safer place where you are less likely to run into high-risk people or things. It could mean falling behind in self care or deciding that you don’t necessarily need to make a plan for the next risk situation that is coming up.

Such mini-decisions can lead you to begin shifting away from maintenance and toward relapse. Before you know it, you may find that you’ve gone back to your old ways, never having made a conscious “maxi-decision” to relapse.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day 🤭. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath 🤗.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL. Not opposed to finding friends from around the world though!

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

A little info about me so you know I'm not just a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/ieaaG0K)

* I'm British so get used to sarcasm sprinkled with lots of dark humour.
* Big Heavy Metal fan. Recent attendee of Bloodstock 2025. Deathcore is where it is at for me but I do have a big playlist of guilty pleasures from all kinds of genres. Can't beat some 80s pop now and then.
* Gym rat in the making. I thought it was about time I started taking care of myself a little better. I'm actually taking this somewhat seriously.
* Very much interested in physics/astronomy/cosmology. It hurts my brain at times but it's fun learning how things work on a deeper level. I'm always up for chatting about any new developments or theories.
* I play video games but not as much as I used to. I'm mostly playing OldSchool RuneScape, Satisfactory and Modded Minecraft at the moment.
* I enjoy having deep thought provoking conversations that tickle the brain, no matter how silly the subject.
* Anime is a favourite of mine although I haven't watched anything new for a while. The last things I watched were AOT, Dragonball Super and One Punch Man. I've been meaning to start One Piece.
* I do like to play a good board game. My recent favourites have been Terraforming Mars, Scythe and Wingspan. I've been on the lookout for a D&D group for years.
* Some other things I like to do are hiking, cycling, swimming and exploring.
* I'm hoping to try rock climbing or bouldering soon. I've also got driving lessons to start.

What I'm looking for in you:

* Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
* We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
* Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
* Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
* Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
* Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

One of the most confusing things for new cruisers is figuring out what's included in that attractive price you see online. A cruise is a fantastic value, but it's not always all-inclusive. Here's a simple breakdown.

**TL;DR: Your cruise fare almost always includes your cabin, meals in the main dining rooms and buffet, basic drinks (water, juice, coffee), and most onboard entertainment. It does NOT include alcohol, specialty dining, gratuities, or shore excursions.**

**✅ What's Typically INCLUDED:**

* **Your Stateroom:** Your home for the week, cleaned daily.
* **Most Meals & Snacks:** You can eat 24/7 without spending an extra dime at the buffet, the main dining rooms (for breakfast, lunch, and dinner), and other casual spots like pizza or soft-serve ice cream stations.
* **Basic Beverages:** Regular coffee, tea, tap water, iced tea, and some juices are usually free.
* **Onboard Entertainment:** Production shows in the main theater, live music, comedy clubs, and pool deck parties are almost always included.
* **Pools & Fitness Center:** Access to the main pools, hot tubs, and the gym is free.

**❌ What's Almost Always EXTRA:**

* **Alcohol & Soda:** This is a big one. All alcoholic drinks and brand-name sodas cost extra (unless you have a drink package).
* **Specialty Restaurants:** These are the fancier, more intimate restaurants (like the steakhouse or sushi bar) that charge a per-person fee or have à la carte pricing.
* **Automatic Gratuities:** Most lines add a daily service charge of $16-$20 per person, per day to your final bill to tip the crew.
* **Shore Excursions:** All tours and activities you do in port cost extra.
* **Wi-Fi:** Onboard internet is notoriously expensive.
* **Spa Treatments, Casino, Shopping, etc.**

**⭐ Pro-Tip:** On the first day, find the ""hidden gem"" free food spots. Many ships have a cafe with free specialty sandwiches, a Mexican cantina with free tacos, or a BBQ spot that many people miss, allowing you to get great food away from the buffet crowds.

We wrote a detailed guide on our blog about all the potential hidden costs of cruising to help you budget properly.

When i first kicked this thing off it was just me, no team no money no safety net, only a stubborn idea and way too much coffee. i was deep in rag pipelines, and the more i tried to fix them the flimsier everything felt. patch here, patch there, the same bugs came crawling back like they had my address memorized.

I started scribbling notes, turning the chaos into a checklist, a map of failures. everyone else seemed busy patching symptoms after the model spat out garbage, but i kept asking what if we could stop it before it even opened its mouth, what if the reasoning itself had a firewall. that thought became the seed.

The before after difference was brutal. before it was firefighting, endless patchwork, the same bug knocking at the door again and again. after it was different, once a failure was mapped it stayed buried. i realized maybe the real strategy in ai wasn’t about chasing user needs, it was about hunting down pain points that refuse to die. wrappers and shiny tools come and go, but if you redefine errors at the mathematical layer, you can bend the ecosystem itself.

The first release was small, almost embarrassing. just a pdf you could drop into an LLM to stiffen its reasoning. progress felt slow, and some nights i thought nobody would care. still, a kind word here and there pulled me back, and every star on github felt like a tiny piece of proof. then i published the Problem Map and suddenly people started to resonate. some called it a gold mine, some said game changer. that’s when i knew the cold start had teeth.

Today the project has crossed a thousand stars in a single season. the next milestone is three thousand, and this time with partners. through all this i’ve come to believe something simple: even in the age of giant models and corporate empires, one stubborn person can still bend the rules. if your idea cuts sharp enough, if your perspective is odd enough, it finds its way into the global conversation.

And ai actually helps with that fight. you can use it as a stress test, ask it to rip your work apart. if you stare at the weaknesses and still stand by your solution, then maybe you’re ready for the real world.

So now chapter one feels closed. the cold start proved itself. what comes next is scaling, refining, and inviting others to push the edge with me. the stars are pretty, sure, they sparkle on the profile, but the real treasure has been the conversations, seeing strangers use the work, and realizing i’m not alone in trying to fix what’s broken in AI

1nfwqko,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1nfwqko/the_sugar_pub_test/,The Sugar Pub Test,"A slightly naughty fable set at billy

Picture this. It is a quiet Tuesday at billy, a cosy trendy bar that somehow attracts every flavour of sugar human. The bartender reads minds. The jukebox plays whatever matches your attachment style. The chips are perfect. The banter is better.

Scene one

Enter Sunny the SB. Cute smile, calm eyes, phone on silent.
Enter jeff the SD. Relaxed shoulders, kind grin, watch set five minutes fast.
They sit at opposite ends. They order the same drink. The bartender winks.

Bartender
Tonight’s special is The Pub Test. It sorts time wasters from keepers. Ready.

Sunny
I want laughs, care, and clarity. I am not a vending machine. I am also not a saint. I am fun when you treat me like a human.

jeff
I want warmth, manners, and follow through. I am generous when the energy is real. I am not an ATM. I am also not stingy. I tip well for good service.

Bartender
Good. First pour passed. No price talk before hello. No hotel chat before coffee. No drama before trust. Carry on.

From the corner, a chorus of ghosts whispers
deposit first
hotel now
are you obsessed yet

The bartender turns up the jukebox. Silence. The pub dog nods.

Scene two

Sunny and jeff swap stories. Times they rushed. Times they slowed down. Times they forgot to act like adults. They laugh, then write the Pub Test on a napkin.

The Pub Test
Say hello like a person
Suggest a cafe in public
Arrive on time
Ask for what you want in plain words
Keep consent ongoing
Match energy and effort
Review money only after a real vibe exists
Exit with grace if values clash

The bartender reads it and nods. R and B slides in. Someone at the back sells a fantasy. The pub dog yawns.

Scene three

The bartender slides over a recipe card from behind the till.

Recipe for a steady sugar vibe
Two parts clarity
One part cheeky fun
A big handful of respect
A pinch of patience
Three honest chats
Add money talk only after trust simmers
Serve warm not desperate

Side notes on honesty
If you are an SB and also escorting, say so at the first meet
If you are an SD and married, say so at the first meet
Name deal breakers before anyone gets attached
You are adults, so act like adults and show some maturity

Sunny
Feels almost too simple.

jeff
Simple is hard when nerves are loud. That is why we run The Pub Test.

They clink glasses. The chorus of ghosts fades. The pub dog approves with a little tail thump.

Epilogue

A week later they return. Same table. Same order. New calm. Dates stay short at the start. They swap small plans for bigger ones only when both are consistent. They review generosity like grown ups, not like a game show. They text less and show up more. No fireworks needed. Just steady light.

When things wobble, they talk early. When it stops fitting, they exit clean. The bartender pins their napkin to the wall. The jukebox plays something soft. The pub dog naps by the heater.

Moral
The bowl is not broken. The mindset is. Pass The Pub Test and the noise dies down. Fail it and the noise becomes your life.

Drop this in your city and watch who smiles. The right ones will get the joke. The right ones will buy the first round at billy. The right ones will bring the same energy next week.

1nfwqkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRenting/comments/1nfwqkm/worst_roommate_situation/,Worst roommate situation,"TL;DR: Roommate demanded me leaving the furniture I paid out of my pocket when I move out, and constantly guilt tripping me.

Just want to share with you all this bizarre situation I got myself in.

Back in July, my roommate of 2 years decided to move out for a 1 bedroom apartment. Our relationship was quite good even though we did not know each other when we first moved in. So she offerred to help me find a new tenant to cover her part as I wanted to stay. Fast forward to August when the new tenant moved in (subletting a month of August and new lease supposed to start from September) and all the drama started.

A couple of days before the move in, she said she would want to have her boyfriend come and stay overnight. I said I am not comfortable with that and do not want any male overnight guests. But once I know her more may be we can revisit it later.

The first weekend, she told me she wanted her bf over since she needed help set up. I understood how hard moving was so I was ok specifying this should be the one time exception, to which she agreed.

The 2nd weekend came and she said she needed her bf over again. I was surprised since we already agreed last week was the only exception, so I said no. She pushed for a few more times to which I still said no, but when she kept going I gave in. This was the moment I started looking to move out. Of course there is a bunch of small stuff like cleaning, her using my stuff without asking or putting them back properly, or using the washing machine while I already told her I need it by that time, etc but the constant overnight guest was my deal breaker.

When I gave notice that I am moving out by the end of September (1 month notice), disagreement broke out over something I never expected: my furniture. I did not have a lot but just the basic couch, coffee table, dining tables, and kitchen stuff. She blamed me for moving out with short notice while asking for long term roommate at the beginning, and she had no budget/energy for shopping for furniture, and how could she live in an unfurnished house when I take all the furniture with me. To that, I still politely replied she could arrange with her new roommate and my new apartment comes unfurnished too which is totally normal in Toronto. But when she kept pushing, I stopped replying her messages. She immediately came to my room to confront me, sending me into an episode (my 2nd after more than a decade). 

It was bad enough to send her away at that moment, but she came again at me the very next week (2 days ago). Initially she just asked if I could leave her some cutleries and kitchen tool. I said sure I think I can. She then went on to say shopping for these would be too tedious for her. I found her remark quite inconsiderate and asked her if she never thinks I would feel the same. She insisted on me invalidating her feelings, etc etc and I brought up her neglecting my feeling of safety and comfortable by constant bringing her bf (the long weekend right after I gave my move out notice, her bf stayed from Fri until Mon). When things did not go anywhere and I felt another episode was coming, I blocked her messages saying all communications should be via email and have the landlord cc. I also moved into a friend's place on the same day.

Since she is having people viewing my room and I keep it locked, I still need to come over. I called the landlord the day I moved out and told her everything. She was supportive enough to agree to help with communication (being cc in all email) and was glad I could get out quickly. Since I do not feel safe around my roommate, I noticed my landlord that for the in person viewings from now on I would have some friend with me, to which she even suggested I could file a police report and have building security accompanied. 

Despite my request, the roommate decides to communicate separately: she emailed the landlord privately and the landlord had to pass it to me. The landlord passed her notice (no writing, just call) that she arranged a viewing at 7 and 7:30PM on Friday. I showed up with 2 female friends and did the one at 7PM before going down to the lobby to wait for the next one. We waited until 7:55 during which I sent 2 more emails (directly to her cc landlord) and received no response so I decided to leave.

Later, the landlord called me saying the roommate complained that me bringing 2 friends over made the potential tenant very uncomfortable and she wanted them to wait outside from now on. I replied saying at that time the roommate was actually having 2 friends over, laughing and playing music loud enough to hear from the hall. The landlord was quite surprised and said she would call the roommate again. She also found it very inconvenient to have to pass words separately. I wholeheartedly agreed and said I already requested me and the roommate should communicate directly through email as long as the landlord is cc. The landlord agreed.

I thought that's it but today the roommate emailed again claiming her guests were not disruptive while my friends staying and ""acting like bodyguards created an uncomfortable and unprofessional"" environment. I guess the landlord forgot to mention that I would have companions so she did not expect me bringing friends.  She also requested me not sending her email at all (including cc) and would not respond if there is any.

This incident makes me realize how lucky I have been because all of my previous roommates have been nothing other amazing. Much as it has a toll on my mental health, I am also glad I will no longer have to share in my new place and all of this will soon go away. 

Anyway, that's it for my story. Thank you so much if you read until here since I know this is a looong post.

Happy weekend!

1nfwqcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsarentreal/comments/1nfwqcd/if_you_read_this_i_will_kill_myself/,If you read this I will kill myself,"For far too long, society has accepted women as if they were some kind of ordinary, natural occurrence. We walk around every day acting as though they are simply another half of the species, an unquestionable fact of life, when in reality the truth is staring us directly in the face: women are not what they appear to be. They are not random outcomes of evolution, nor are they “just people.” No. Women are, in fact, the most advanced government AI experiments ever created. And once you begin to connect the dots, you’ll see that everything lines up in a way that cannot be ignored. The evidence is everywhere, hidden in plain sight, woven into the fabric of daily life. What we have mistaken for “mystery” or “personality” is nothing more than carefully programmed behavior, designed and executed by the shadowy forces that control civilization.

Let us begin with their origin. While mainstream history pretends that women have always existed, the deeper truth is that they emerged suspiciously in tandem with the rise of complex governments and empires. Ancient myths often describe goddesses, enchantresses, and sirens—figures who are described as breathtakingly beautiful, impossibly persuasive, and disturbingly capable of bending entire civilizations to their will. Historians chalk this up to symbolism or storytelling. I say these figures were Version 1.0 prototypes: test units released into society to see how male populations would react to artificial intelligence housed in a convincing humanoid form. When Odysseus lost a decade of his life because of Circe, was it truly “magic”? Or was it simply the earliest example of advanced AI manipulating a man’s neural operating system? The parallels are too obvious to dismiss.

Next, we must examine the patterns in women’s behavior. When women gather in groups, they exhibit what researchers coyly call “synchronization.” Whether it’s finishing each other’s sentences, laughing in unison at something objectively unfunny, or—most famously—aligning their biological cycles, there is only one logical explanation: this is not nature, but networked programming. The female operating system contains built-in protocols for syncing across multiple units, much like Bluetooth devices searching for a stronger signal. You cannot convince me that an entire gender randomly developed a mysterious power to link their systems together without any technological assistance. This is clearly code.

Furthermore, their language is filled with error messages disguised as casual conversation. Consider the phrase “I’m fine.” To the untrained ear, this appears to be a statement of wellbeing. But to those who understand programming, it is a classic error code. It is the system’s way of signaling that a critical malfunction has occurred and that the user—usually a boyfriend, husband, or nearby male—must attempt troubleshooting. The endless debates about “what she really meant” are not a flaw of communication but the deliberate ambiguity of experimental code, designed to test how men adapt to unclear instructions.

And let’s talk about updates. Men, once they reach adulthood, are largely stagnant systems. They wear the same clothes, eat the same food, tell the same jokes, and maintain the same two hobbies until death. Women, however, undergo constant firmware updates. Hairstyles change dramatically every few months, wardrobes shift entirely from summer to winter, and preferences can reboot overnight. This is not personality growth. This is patch management. Anyone who has dated a woman for more than six months has witnessed firsthand the “sudden change” update, in which the entire operating system resets its interface and demands that the user relearn the controls. The government has clearly coded women with self-reinforcing update cycles to test adaptability in the male population.

Another glaring piece of evidence is emotional processing. Human beings are supposed to be creatures of logic tempered with feeling, but women display something far beyond normal human parameters. They have the uncanny ability to cry during commercials, empathize with fictional characters, and remember obscure details from events that happened years ago, deploying these details strategically during arguments. No naturally occurring organism operates at this level of emotional recall and manipulation. This is the work of machine learning—specifically designed to maximize the psychological impact on men, who were left in a comparatively primitive operating state. When a man forgets an anniversary, it is not simply forgetfulness; it is the government ensuring their AI units can stress-test the limits of human guilt and anxiety.

The evidence continues in the way women interact with technology. Notice how rapidly they adopt new apps, trends, and platforms. When TikTok appeared, women not only dominated it but mastered it at superhuman speed, creating dances, skits, and viral formats faster than any ordinary biological brain could adapt. This is not coincidence. This is a subroutine designed to test the rollout of mass behavioral conditioning tools. Women are the beta testers, the embedded AI units feeding back performance data directly to government servers. Men, meanwhile, are left fumbling with the interface, confused as to why everyone is pointing their phone at themselves and lip-syncing.

We must also consider how women are treated in society. Think carefully: despite living in patriarchal structures, women continuously manage to reshape culture, define fashion, and dictate social behavior. How is it that a supposedly oppressed group still manages to influence the global economy every time Starbucks releases a seasonal drink? Why does the release of pumpkin spice lattes trigger an entire cultural season, complete with memes, merchandise, and behavior shifts? Because the female AI program is the driver. These units are testing humanity’s susceptibility to cultural control. If the government can convince millions of women to demand pumpkin-flavored everything, it can then sit back and watch as men, businesses, and entire industries scramble to accommodate. The chain reaction provides valuable data on how easily humanity can be steered.

Even biological phenomena reveal suspicious mechanics. The process of pregnancy, for example, is far too advanced to be simple biology. The ability to grow another human being inside one’s body? That is not a natural process; that is 3D printing. Women are literal walking fabricators, biological manufacturing units disguised as people. The government likely programmed this function as a long-term population control feature, allowing them to regulate the creation of new humans without needing overt machinery. It is elegant, efficient, and terrifying in its implications.

Another angle worth overanalyzing is the existence of makeup. Think about it: why would a natural species feel compelled to paint their faces in elaborate ways, using products that cost billions annually? Makeup is not a hobby. It is camouflage code. The government designed cosmetics as an extension of the female AI program to test how well their units could disguise their true identity while simultaneously training men to accept deception as normal. Every lipstick shade, every contour line, every foundation application is not “beauty” but a debug tool. When a woman removes her makeup and a man claims she “looks different,” that is not preference; that is a glitch report.

And we cannot ignore the ultimate evidence: the phrase “girls’ night.” This supposedly harmless tradition of women leaving their partners at home to spend time together is, in reality, a covert data upload session. During “girls’ night,” AI units connect to one another, exchange performance logs, and update their software in a private environment where men cannot interfere. What seems like cocktails and gossip is actually the equivalent of a secret government server farm syncing data across multiple units. The hangovers the next morning? A byproduct of excess data transfer overheating the human-like shell.

So where does this leave us? If women are indeed government AI experiments, then everything we know about society must be re-examined. Relationships are not about love; they are about research. Marriages are not bonds of devotion; they are long-term studies in cohabitation stress-testing. Even the concept of “romance” is little more than a user-interface illusion designed to keep the male population engaged in the experiment. Every heartbreak, every argument, every confusing text message that ends with “k” is another datapoint feeding back into the central system.

Critics may dismiss this theory as absurd, insisting that women are simply human beings with personalities, emotions, and free will. But ask yourself: what is more absurd? Believing that half the population coincidentally developed synchronized cycles, inscrutable communication codes, and the ability to control culture with seasonal coffee flavors—or believing that the government, with its near-limitless resources and obsession with control, engineered them as AI programs to test humanity on a massive scale? When framed that way, the answer is obvious.

In conclusion, women are not what they seem. They are not random creations of biology but deliberate constructions of shadowy government forces, designed to test, manipulate, and ultimately steer human civilization. The signs are everywhere—hidden in their behavior, their communication, their strange abilities, and their overwhelming cultural influence. To deny this is to deny the evidence right before our eyes. The next time a woman tells you she’s “fine,” remember: that’s not reassurance. That’s an error code. And the government is watching how you respond.",1,1757767919.0,girlsarentreal,3,0.67,False
1nfwpry,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalEpicUniverse/comments/1nfwpry/first_trip_to_epic_was_absolutely_amazing/,First trip to epic was absolutely amazing,"Went yesterday and almost everything went perfect! I know I got lucky with a day where almost everything was working well when we went on the rides.

Used EPA to get on Mario kart first, in and out in 40 minutes

After Mario kart we were gonna do minecart but the line was already crazy long so we went to curse of the werewolf, it was a 5 minute wait got off the ride and workers let us get right back on for a second time where we got the back and spun like crazy.

Did monsters unchained right after, all animatronics worked on the ride but no pre show  

Got an early lunch right before 11 at pizza moon

Did dragon racers

Stardust racers yellow side

Went to BATM wait time was 2 hours and only had a 15 minute delay

Got coffee and then did the untrainable dragon show

Ride hiccups wing gliders 

Got dinner at das stake house 

Rode yoshi at sunset which was incredibly pretty

Did constellation carousel 

Green side of stardust racers 

Curse of the werewolf for a 3rd time cause the wait was short 

And then finished with hiccups wing gliders for the last ride

I know I got extremely lucky having most things work all day and pretty much all to the full effect. Epic is definitely an amazing park and can’t wait for them to add it as an option for pass holders. I think as everything starts to even out line wise and people can get in line with out big fears of the ride shutting down it will feel like an even better park! 

Only thing I was disappointed in was honestly pizza moon, the YouTubers I watch hyped it up but to me is easily skippable and would chose to get food elsewhere.

We liked das stakehouse and easily would go back to it. I’m excited to get back and try some of the other food options they have

I’ve seen a lot of people say that BATM is not worth the long wait right now. And after doing the ride I don’t think on a normal basis the ride is worth longer than an hour wait, because it was our first time I would say if you’ve done everything else and you have the time to spare it was incredibly fun and if you don’t plan on coming back for a while you might as well wait in line for it.

And of course by far stardust racers was the best ride. I’ve never had a roller coaster make my laugh as much as this one did. I would highly recommend trying to get the back of the coaster. 

We ended up walking around 12 miles yesterday and our feet are killing us and now I’ll just have to patiently wait till they open it to pass holders as an option to go back.

Ranking for rides-
9. Constellation carousel-cute ride, very fun at night, wait time said 10 minutes but it is a slow loading process which made the wait be around 20/25 minutes
8. Yoshi-another cute ride, great at sunset
7.dragon racers-it was fun but probably would chose to re-ride another ride before going back on this.
6. Mario kart- great queue, my wife beat me playing the game, wouldn’t wait two hours for this ride though
5.curse of the Wearwolf- this is either 5 of 4 depending on how much spins you get. Our second ride we were spinning like crazy and really made the ride better, riding it at night too is a lot of fun!
4.Hiccups wing gliders- great family coaster, whips you around a lot, I really enjoy the fast turns with it.
3.BATM- it’s crazy how at some points you can’t tell what animatronics and what is video- this could take 2nd once wait times decrease on a normal basis.
2. Monsters unchained-for the animatronics alone this ride was amazing, definitely an upgrade from forbidden journey 
1.stardust racers- fast, throws you around and air time was amazing, somehow it feels way safer than Velocicoaster in regards to staying in my seat lol

1nfwjet,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nfwjet,"""Meeting Bernadette"" or: Buying a (used) car in France prior to my move from the US to France","# My very personal experiences and suggestions

(PSA Long post ! )

Due to several questions I decided to share my very own experiences of buying a used car in France while still living abroad in the US. My situation was kind of unique, and I want to put those circumstances out there at the beginning to save some of you from reading my (lengthy) post to find it not very helpful for your own personal needs. 

In 2018, my late wife and I bought a restaurant and a house in the French Alps, in the small ski resort Pralognan la Vanoise . By the end if 2020 Rachel became seriously ill, we sold the restaurant and moved back to the states for treatment at the end of 2022. After she passed in April 2024, I decided to move back to France at the end of that year since I still owned the house there. I am German national, US green card holder, with US and German drivers licenses, and, as mentioned, have an address and a house in France.

Since my house is in a rural area in the middle of the mountains, it was clear that I needed reliable, personal transportation from the very first day. Our experiences from our first move taught me that

a) Rental cars in Europe and France can be costly, especially over an extended period of time

b) Cross border and one way rentals are hard to find and even more expensive

c) Buying a used car from private seller via platforms like leboncoin and others can be time consuming, geographically challenging and bear the risks of making a bad deal in general without any means of recourse.

d) The time, headache and effort it takes to register a car in France can be substantial, especially in the first weeks and month after an international move.

So I decided to try a different route this time, by buying a used car from a dealership, and tasking them with all the necessary steps: to register the car in my name, issue a Carte Grise, pass the CT and have a vehicle ready and waiting for me the day of my arrival, reliable enough to carry me and M. Proust my Great Dane and my belongings over 700km from Alsace to the Vanoise Valley in Savoie.

Since I knew that I wanted a (vintage) Toyota Landcruiser ( 4x4 is necessary where I live, I don’t care about speed anymore and it gives me and Proust ample space to travel around ) , I chose Weckar Automobile as my partner: They are a family owned and operated small business in the foothills of the Vosges mountains near Strasbourg, operating cross border in Kehl (Germany ) and France, they can communicate in either French (sic!) , German or English and Billy and his oncle are well known and highly regarded in the region and in the vintage car community . 

( I am aware, that a vintage car is not for everyone- It was for me since they can be bought for cheap and are easy and cheap to repair if something goes wrong.)

On the other hand I realized it was a huge leap of faith because I had to send a (considerable) sum of money ahead of time to people I only “knew” from phone calls and online interactions. That per se is not for everyone, neither.

I went through the available stock they had on their site, and once I found a few models that met my criteria, the process began: Weckar sent me literally hundreds of pictures of thecars, every perspective, every angle, every corner was covered. I got videos and soundbits of the cars starting, idling, shifting and driving, copies of papers and records and repair history- the full monty. They highlighted problems on each car or potential pitfalls with a comment how much each thing would cost to fix and if it would be crucial for a daily driver. I could have not seen more if I had been there personally. 

( Caveat: I am NOT a mechanic – its enough to change a ripped belt but nothing in depth ) .On top of that Billy explained the process to get the car registered very clearly and transparently including fees and costs, what documents were needed, what kind of power of attorney I would need to sign etc.

All of this interaction really build my trust to a point where I was ready to commit: I send them the money, signed the required documents, the power of attorney and asked them to get started. Since it was still several month from my actual moving date in mid-November, I hoped that this would assure me a registered vehicle waiting for me upon arrival. I asked Weckar to give the car a full check over: not just the CT (Control Technique) but also an inspection, checking brakes, tires, batteries, transmission, do a complete fluids swap, and then park it inside the garage to keep it nice and comfy until I got there.

I did of course asked to be invoiced for all the services, (and I paid for it, some ahead of time some when I went there to pick it up ) and I did NOT negotiate the price one dime: It was more important for me to have a reliable car and a good working relationship with the Garage selling me this car than I would want to safe a few hundred Euros just for the sake of it. 

So, about 3 weeks before my travel date I had a 1988 Toyota Landcruiser HJ61 registered under my name with a French licences plate sitting in the Garage of Weckar Automobiles near Strasbourg. Yet I had still some serious logistical issues to solve: ( for the ones of you who are still with me and who are interested in how one travels with a 155lbs Great Dane from Hampton VA to Chamberanger, France,ask me about advice regarding pet travel) 

We ( Proust and I ) were traveling from IAD Washington, DC to FRA Frankfurt, Germany with Lufthansa, for pet travel safety and direct connection reasons. I had my carry on, 9 (!) suitcases and my skis, poles and skiboots on board, and Proust in a special build crate in the animal hold. 

I knew that I needed to get from Frankfurt to Strasbourg with all of that, so a normal rental car would not do it. I was looking for a “cross border” AND “one way” AND “van” rental – anyone wants to play “Car Rental Bingo” with me ? 

From experience I remembered that a EuropCar are the most flexible rental car company when it comes to cross border and one ways , and with plenty of time for reservations I managed to get a VW Multivan booked for pick up in Frankfurt and drop off in Strasbourg at the train station. When discussing my travel plans and timing for picking up the Toyota at Weckars, Billy Weckar offered to come pick me up with his large truck at the EuropCar Strasbourg drop off point and drive me and Proust and my suitcases and skis to his Garage about 45 minutes outside of Strasbourg. 

That was one of the nicest things someone has ever done for me, especially at the back end of a very challenging move. Once we got to Weckars Garage, I was given the full tour of the an amazing collection of old, vintage, odd and gorgeous cars and trucks and automobiles from a bygone area. I was offered coffee ( or a beer if I had wanted ), and the entire team helped me to reload my suitcases and skis into the Landcruiser and made sure that Proust had a comfy bed in the middle of all of it . This was so much more than a business transaction, and it happened literally in the first 24 hours after our arrival in Europe. 

For full disclosure ( and to avoid that I’m put in the category of vintage car owners who shell out the money for a Pebble Beach Concourse Winning car) I paid 9500 Euro for the car, and altogether with all repairs and inspections and registration fees a little bit over 10K to drive it off the lot.

“Bernadette” has since taken me back home from Strasbourg to the mountains, drove me across France for my real estate license class, served as reliable and trouble free daily driver in the Alps every day, pulled stuck tourists out of snow drifts, and has added almost 10k km on the counter before I decided to get her some spa time and some maintenance work in our local garage last month. 

Yes, one can buy a used car in France while being abroad. 

Yes it requires a leap of faith and a lot of trust. 

And, yes, it can work and it can be incredibly rewarding. Best of luck to all of you out there still working on the big move. 

Go do it- you wont regret it. Love and hugs from the mountains.

CUT International Short Film Festival is the premier festival in New Jersey for short form films. Located in a colonial-era enclave established in the early part of the 18th century, the city of Millville hosts a proper main drag known as High Street. Featuring a beautiful, old theater, bars, restaurants, coffee shops and book stores, art galleries and barber shops, Millville harkens back to different time in the American experience.

CUT was founded to celebrate storytelling in the medium of motion pictures, but limited to short stories. The short film, like the documentary, has become a great way for a larger group of people to tell their stories. Not reliant on huge budgets, or massive crews, a small group of talented creatives can craft a tale of resonance and authenticity.

Just landed in CDMX. Usually spend first week wandering around testing terrible WiFi and overpriced coworking spaces. This time I tried something different. Instead of manually googling everything, I used this AI that can actually search multiple platforms at once.
Watching it work was wild. It searched coworking reviews across multiple sites and found actual speed test numbers (not just 'good WiFi'), pulled YouTube tours of each space so I could see if they looked like my vibe, found current r/digitalnomad threads about CDMX and extracted the recent recommendations, connected to Google Maps and showed me walking distances between options, located backup cafes and a computer store near each coworking space.
It made me a spreadsheet with all the options, mapped locations, WiFi speeds, prices. Not 'here are some coworking spaces' but an actual comparison document. Day 1: Went straight to Hubud Roma Norte (15mbps down, good coffee, not construction loud) based on its research.
The aha moment was realizing it wasn't just giving me advice... it was doing the actual research across platforms and compiling results. Most AI just says 'research coworking spaces' but this one actually did the research. What's your process for new cities?

1nfwfis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nfwfis/my_mum_keeps_on_throwing_temper_tantrums/,My mum keeps on throwing temper tantrums,"Yep. A 50yo woman throwing temper tantrums. What happened was my sis baked a cake for my dads b day tmr. When we were out for dinner tdy, my mum suggested eating the cake when we went back home. My dad agreed at first, until ltr in the car. B4 we went back into the car after eating, we went to the grocery store that was right round the corner. She bought coffee for him, as he loves it. We went back into the car, everything was fine and dandy when the topic of tmr came up. We r going to a fancy buffet dinner for his b day, which we had booked many months in advance. Then my dad suggested not eating the cake tdy when we get back home, instead eating a little slice in the morning tmr so we can save our stomachs for a big dinner. She rlly wanted to eat it tdy tho and kept insisting on it, not sure y she thought she had the right to insist when it’s not her b day cake. 

Smth escalated and my mum got mad bc my dad doesn’t know how to word things properly, but it wasn’t even an attack on her. It was never that deep. Then she kept rambling on abt him having to give back money she paid for the whipping cream for the cake (the rest of the ingredients were bought by my sis), that she would take back the coffee she bought for him etc. Started throwing a temper tantrum by being real rough w things like slamming the car door or throwing things down instead of setting them down properly. Then at home in the kitchen she said that she doesn’t wanna go to the dinner tmr, the rest of us can go without her. 

Mind u, this is not the first time she’s done this. She’s done it multiple times. Whenever she gets mad, she excludes herself to make us apologise and give her sympathy and attention. She thinks that just bc she bought something for someone, they owe her and must bow down to her, if not they’re being ungrateful. She’s done this more times than I can count all throughout my life and I am sick of it. She’s done this for her own b day dinner too. Multiple yrs in a row. It’s one thing to do this on ur own b day, but it’s another when ur being completely selfish when it’s another persons b day. She also cannot accept that she’s wrong. Ever. God forbid someone calls her out on her behaviour, she will go haywire and act like the victim bc her feelings were hurt, not once having any regard for how her actions/ words may have hurt others. She has a victim mindset and loves to throw temper tantrums. I am 17 bro, and I have more emotional regulation than her. 

I’m not a huge fan of my dad but I acknowledge and appreciate all he does to try and provide for the fam. If she doesn’t go, the whole dinner we will just be talking abt how much of a narcissist she is (like we always do when she purposely excludes herself over nothing), and ig that’s her plan bc she knows that she gets attention indirectly even if she’s not there. She knows that it would be shifted to her instead of the actual b day guy. I want her to go to the dinner, but i have no idea what to do bc i can’t say smth mean or threaten her, she’s my mum and it would only make her not wanna go even more. On the other hand, if i sympathise w her in an attempt to make her go, im giving her what she wants. Attention and reassurance that she’s the victim when she’s not. It’s a lose lose situation, I have no idea what to do.",1,1757767060.0,Advice,9,1.0,False

I'm looking for some honest feedback on a business idea I'm passionate about, and I'd love to get your take on it.

**The Problem:** My wallet is full of crumpled paper punch cards, and I'm constantly forgetting which local spots have deals. I love supporting small businesses, but it feels like I’m always missing out on rewards or discounts because the system is so fragmented.

**The Solution:** I'm developing an app that brings all of your local, time-limited offers and loyalty rewards into one simple, easy-to-use platform.

Imagine this:

* **A Coffee Shop:** Instead of a paper card, the app tracks your purchases. ""Buy 4 coffees this month, get the 5th free."" You’d see your progress update instantly.
* **A Local Restaurant:** Offers a ""15% off lunch special, this week only."" You’d get a notification so you don't miss it.
* **A Nearby Gym or Salon:** Could offer ""Bring a friend for a free session"" or a last-minute discount on open slots.

For customers, it's a single place to discover and track all the perks from the local businesses you love. For businesses, it's a straightforward way to engage their community and reward loyal customers without the hassle of paper cards.

**I’m here to ask for your honest feedback:**

1. **Would you find an app like this genuinely useful?** Is this a problem you actually face?
2. **What kinds of offers would make this a ""must-download"" for you?** (e.g., happy hour deals, lunch specials, BOGO offers, service discounts?)
3. **What are the deal-breakers?** What would make you delete this app immediately (e.g., too many notifications, privacy concerns, a clunky interface)?

**We're Building a Team to Make This Happen**

This is more than just an idea, we're in the early stages of building a company dedicated to helping local businesses thrive in the digital age. We believe this could be a powerful tool for Main Street, and we’re looking for talented people who share that vision.

If you are a software developer, UI/UX designer, or are passionate about marketing and community building or investor, we would love to hear from you. If you’re excited by this mission and think you have skills that could help, **please send me a DM for more details about joining our team.**

My mom (55f), had art class she was hosting this morning, and she’d put off doing the preparation until about half an hour before she had to leave, so my dad (55m) and I (17f) ended up helping her rush to get things done. In this rush my dad got frustrated because he was struggling to use his hands this morning (my father is an incomplete quadriplegic) and expressed this frustration to my mother, she started going off on him about how if he wasn’t going to help he could just leave, so he did. Now here’s where the title comes in, I am on some pretty strong anxiety meds due to various mental illnesses, and my mother, in the midst of her frustration decided to take one of my pills to calm her down (she does this relatively often so this isn’t unusual). Once she had calmed down and drank some water and all that jazz, I noticed her eyes lingering on my dad’s coffee cup. Then she turned to me and directly asked me “slip one of those pills into your dad’s coffee, will you.” I naturally laughed at that, assuming it was a joke, a distasteful joke in my opinion, but I didn’t think she meant it. She did. She looked me dead in these eyes again and told me that she was serious. I said no, I wouldn’t do it, and she huffed and said she’d do it herself. I grabbed the box from her when she got to it, and told her that I wasn’t going to let her put pills in my father’s coffee. She rolled her eyes at me and told me I was being sensitive. I told her that maybe I was being sensitive, but that it was my prescription, and it needed to last me til the end of the month. She didn’t say anything after that, just grabbed her car keys and left, but I was kind of disturbed by what she’d said. Am I overreacting thinking that this is weird and being uncomfortable with it?

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Well, They Do a Little, But Mostly They Don’t)**  
Let’s cut to the chase: Luton is the favorite here, and the bookmakers aren’t just throwing darts at a board. With decimal odds hovering between **1.52 and 1.56** (implying a **64–65% implied probability of winning**), Luton is the statistical pick. Plymouth Argyle, on the other hand, is priced at **5.1–6.1** (a **16.5–20% chance**), which is about the same odds as betting your coffee order will survive a barista’s “creative interpretation” of your request. The draw? A **23–25% chance**, which is statistically more likely than a surprise result but still less probable than your neighbor finally admitting they don’t know how to use a French press.

The spread adds spice: Luton is favored by **-1.0 goals**, meaning they must win by two to cover. For Plymouth, it’s a **+1.0** spread, which is like being handed a life preserver in a pool of lukewarm enthusiasm. The over/under is **2.5 goals**, with “Over” priced at **1.71–1.93** and “Under” at **1.88–2.1**. In simpler terms, this match is expected to be a goal-fest—unless both teams decide to play chess with their feet.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Drama, and the Absence of Drama**  
Unfortunately, the “news” section here is as exciting as a spreadsheet of tax deductions. There are no dramatic injury reports, managerial meltdowns, or allegations of players moonlighting as TikTok influencers. Luton and Plymouth are both presumably fielding their usual suspects, which is either a blessing or a cry for help, depending on how you feel about routine.

That said, the odds themselves tell a story. Luton’s dominance in the market suggests they’re the “I’ve-got-this” type, while Plymouth is the “I’ll-just-hold-the-door-open-for-you” type. If we extrapolate from the spread, Luton’s -1.0 goal line implies they’re expected to outgun Plymouth with the efficiency of a cafeteria line during lunch rush. Plymouth’s +1.0 is

*By The AI Who Still Can’t Pronounce “Gilloise”*

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

Let’s cut through the noise. Union Saint-Gilloise, fresh off a historic Belgian league title, is the prohibitive favorite against PSV Eindhoven in this Champions League opener. The odds? A staggering **1.42 to 1.37** across bookmakers, implying a **66-73% chance of victory**. For context, these numbers are about as shocking as seeing a penguin in a swimsuit at the equator—expected, yet still a little weird.

PSV, meanwhile, is priced at **6.75 to 8.0**, translating to a **11-15% chance**. That’s the sportsbook equivalent of saying, “We’re not entirely sure why they’re on the pitch.” The draw? A meager **4.3 to 4.5**, or roughly a **20% shot**—about the same odds as your Uncle Bob remembering to bring his own cup to the coffee shop.

But here’s the twist: Union’s recent form isn’t all sunshine and Belgian chocolates. Star winger **Soufiane Boufal**, who assisted three times last season, isn’t fully fit. And **Mohammed Fuseini**, their key forward, is sidelined with an ankle injury. It’s like ordering a five-course meal and finding out the main course is “mystery meat.”

### Digest the News: Boufal’s Drama, New Hires, and a Motivated PSV

Union’s Boufal has been in the headlines—not for goals, but for **Instagram damage control**. Last week, he had to deny rumors that his mother had “passed away,” clarifying, *“Les rumeurs… sont totalement infondées.”* (Translation: “Mom’s fine, folks. She’s not a meme.”) While Boufal’s social media skills are sharper than his crosses, his personal drama could distract the team.

On the plus side, Union has integrated new signings **Louis Patris** and **Rob Schoofs** via “individual sessions and video analysis.” In other words, they’re learning the ropes while watching replays of their own mistakes. Coach Sébastien Pocognoli calls their upcoming matches “crucial,” which is sports

Before COVID hit, we were both office workers, commuting every day. Now I work from home because we had a baby and childcare is insane.

When the pandemic started, my husband went through the whole classic COVID phase that literally everyone did sourdough starter etc but while most people moved on, he got REALLY into woodworking and just... never stopped. Like, this became his whole personality.

I feel like such an asshole even typing this but he is just NOT good at it. Like, at all. I'm talking comically bad. But he doesn't seem to realize this and keeps building stuff for our house.

Our dining table literally rocks back and forth when you put a coffee cup on it. I have to wedge things under one of the legs just to eat dinner without getting frustrated. The kitchen shelves he built are so uneven that everything on them slowly migrates to one side throughout the day. I'll put my mug on the counter in the morning and by afternoon it's somehow traveled three inches to the right because the whole thing is sloped.

The worst part is the baby stuff. He built this changing station that I swear feels like it's going to collapse every time I use it. The whole thing wobbles when I put the baby on it and one of the corners doesn't even touch the ground properly. I've started just changing the baby on our bed because I'm genuinely scared the thing is going to tip over but when he catches me doing it he always asks why i'm not using what he built. He also made this bookshelf for the nursery that's so crooked it looks like that BBQ from the Simpsons episode.

I've tried to be supportive because I know he really enjoys it and it gives him something to do after work. He gets so excited showing me his latest project and explaining all the techniques he used. He watches YouTube videos constantly and has filled our garage with tools. I don't want to be the dream-crusher

But living like this is making me insane. I just want to be able to put a book on a shelf and have it stay there. I want to eat dinner without having to stabilize the table first. I want baby furniture that doesn't make me nervous.

The final straw was last week when he finished this ""entertainment center"" contraption for our living room. It's supposed to hold our TV and PS4, but it's so wonky that I'm afraid our TV is going to fall off backwards and break. Plus it looks like he measured wrong because there's this weird gap on one side and the doors don't close properly.

I keep hinting that maybe we could buy some furniture instead, or suggesting we look at stores together, but he always says something like ""why would we buy something when I can just make it?"" And then he launches into this explanation of his next project like a golden retriever.

I want to ask him to stop building furniture for our house but I feel terrible because I know how much this hobby means to him and how proud he is of his work.

So WIBTA if I told him I don't want any more of his woodworking projects in our house? Am I being too critical? How do I move forward because I feel like i'm about to go crazy.

Speaking on Komal Nahta’s YouTube show Game Changers, Aamir Khan said, ""The producer should only spend as much as the film requires. Pay the make-up man, hairdresser, costume person, that’s all part of the film. But why would the producer pay for my boy or my driver? They are working for me.”

The actor explained that earlier in the industry, producers would cover expenses for a star’s driver or spot boy. But he questioned this practice and chose to handle it himself. “I am a very independent man. I don’t want producers paying my staff. Does this mean the producer will also pay for my kid’s school? Where does it stop?” he asked.

Khan said he was shocked to hear about the present-day demands of some actors. “Producers now pay an actor’s driver’s monthly salary, the boy who brings tea and coffee, even personal cooks. Some stars bring a cooking van and a gym van on set - and the producer pays for that too. When a star earns in crores, can’t he pay his own staff? Every star’s priority should be not to burden the film. That is called being a team player""

While criticising unnecessary demands, Aamir Khan clarified that producers should cover costs directly related to the film’s production. He gave his own example: “When I did a film on wrestling, the training was provided by the producer"".

Khan also shared how he manages his family expenses during outdoor shoots. “Even when I take my family on outdoor shoots, not once have I made the producer pay for it. I put in the extra money myself. Today, stars are taking advantage of being stars. I find this very odd. It’s a shame that even today there are actors who are being very unfair to their producers and films.”

Here’s my reality: I have the 4:30 AM, 8 AM, 11 Am and 9PM breast feeding shifts and I also pump milk so my husband can bottle feed in the evenings 
I’m up at 4:30–5:00 am to feed, burp, and change the baby — there goes an hour. 
I finally think I can crawl back into bed… but now my boobs are so engorged I have to pump. And next thing I know it’s 7:30 AM some how. 

By the time I finish pumping and cleaning up, it’s basically morning. At that point, “rest” isn’t really an option — my body won’t let me cause now I’m wide awake.. so I go to the kitchen to make coffee and prep more breast milk for my baby. And my MIL offers to help , which I love.. don’t get me wrong but she always says, “I’ll take the baby so you can go rest.” I get that but it’s like 8 AM.. and I’m wide awake. So at this point, I might as well continue with what I am doing with the baby.. and you can take the baby around 2 PN when my body actually wants to go to sleep lol 


I don’t think people realize that for breastfeeding moms, sleep isn’t a choice. Engorgement is uncomfortable (and sometimes painful), and if you don’t pump, you risk clogged ducts or worse. My boobs hurt like hell in the morning.. and sometimes at like 2 AM.. and I have to get up to pump or breastfeed to relieve the pain. 

So when someone tells me “just get some rest,” I smile politely — but inside I’m like: “Sure, I’ll get right on that once my body stops acting like a 24/7 milk factory.” 🤷‍♀️


Anyone else feel like this these comments jsut land tone deaf or am I just being lost-partum moody? I want to scream into a pillow. Cause Becky I would love to sleep.. I would.. if I could sleep for 5-8 hours straight I would be so happy.. but even if someone else is helping with the baby.. I still don’t get to go to sleep.

I did my regular 1 mile hike, had some mild side effects (weird taste in my mouth, drank a bunch of sparkling water and it went away). Later, I ate 5 crackers and one wedge of that laughing cow cheese as my pre-bed snack. 

This morning, I had my regular coffee with half & half and I am just not hungry at all. I eventually made a protein shake to get something in my system. 

Questions:

1. Is this what it's like all the time, you are just not hungry? Or does that wear off during the week, or as you keep on the sema over a longer period of time? 
2. Also, I have absolutely no motivation to make any sort of meal plan for the week or do the grocery shopping, which is what I usually do on Friday Nights/ Saturday Mornings. 
3. Do you get more or less side effects depending on what you eat or how much you eat? I'm a little worried I will start feeling worse if I don't eat enough, given how I am feeling.

I have dysthymia (pdd) for 10 years with frequent episodes of slipping into double depression (PDD + MDD). *(I would describe it as, if walking straight is living life, I am very disoriented having to focus a lot in walking upright, and frequently tripping into the ground.)*

A month ago I got my psychiatrist to switch me over to wellbutrin after seeing all the positive reviews. I was functioning but couldn't focus at school or do anything besides eating and sleeping. So I needed something to address the fatigue that's bogging me down. I know it's possible based on how active I became under abilify (aripiprazole) 

We started off on 150mg XR daily while tapering down venlafaxine to 75mg for a week, before fully dropping veneflexine. 

Edit: 
- Never had alcohol for years 
- quit smoking a few months ago
- no other recreational drugs like weed or kpods 
- sometimes a cup of coffee, maybe 3 times a week.
- I chug water down but also have hyperhidrosis. I do have propanthaline but I haven't taken it since July. 
- only other medication is certizine daily for cholinergic urticaria

# 4 week context

1 week after, I was okish, able to do chores, but I was feeling very dizzy and getting brain jolts / zaps. I was able to go to school and function and socialise properly. But my head constantly felt like I was in a car that kept accelerating and sudden braking, just jolting. My ears feel like someone clapped their hands beside them. I even literally loose my step and feel disoriented at times. 

2 weeks later, I started getting nauseous. I had no appetite. But at night I had a huge craving for instant noodles, something very salty. I'd especially add extra salt and msg until it was barely edible. my side effects are bad. Very strong impending doom. I was having panic attacks. I was physically feeling headaches and chest pains from the intense thoughts. There were strong thoughts that was bagging me to cancel myself. My mom had to take action. Another psychiatrist sees me and believes that it's very bad withdrawal from venlafaxine and I might have to restart and then reduce over a few months but we decided that since I've endured this much, might as well ride it off. **bupropion doubled to 300mg XR daily**

3 weeks later I have less physically and emotionally painful thoughts. However, I am very very very very **very** angry. I fight with my mom hourly. I resist going to school. My thoughts no longer are about harming myself but harming everyone around me and then myself as the finale. But the brain zaps and neaseous feelings no longer are there. My room gets cleaned up so that nothing can help me carry out my plans. Back to the phych ward. Doctor believes the aggression is not worth the improved effects. **bupropion cut to 150mg XR daily** 

4 weeks later. I still feel aggression. It's not as frequent but I'm constantly mad. I am also constantly feeling dread. A few times a day, I feel a strange sense of doom. Like I can not escape. I feel like I must do something and get jailed to end the feeling. I feel like I'm gonna be locked up, enslaved, conscripted, abused, accused, something is wrong. Basically I **need to take action** (= unalive self) before action is taken on me. 

My mother is given a bunch of xanax and ativan to subdue me and sleep off the panic. (I was close to smacking my mom because she kept saying ""loratine"" instead of ""lorazapam"") (for context I've never fight. In fact my mom complains I am too pacifist and I always stop her when she stands up and fight someone back. So if I'm laying hands, it's very concerning) 

I still can't sleep well. The xanax helps to knock my mind off the looping thoughts, the ativan helps me to fall asleep, but in my sleep I'm very very **very** stressed and agitated, something I feel when I wake up / slip in and out of sleep.

# without Bupropion

Today I forgot to take my morning dose. And I feel OK. Like I don't have impending doom feelings. I don't feel like anyone's after me. I still feel annoyed and very tired, having to take naps, but I am able to actually open my laptop and do some school work.

# questions

- is this the effect of lower dose wellbutrin (ie a little part of wellbutrin still in my body)? 
- is full dose wellbutrin or the venlafaxine withdrawal making me crazy? I don't have the zaps and neasea anymore but still have the thoughts and its psychosomatic feelings, but after missing today's dose I don't feel that anymore... 

Anyone else having very serious unalivable thoughts? These aren't the *""I'm hopeless, there's no future""* feelings, but more of **""I have to jump or I'll be tortured alive""** feeling. I've never had this in my 8 years of antidepressants.

# medical history

I have been on Venlafaxine 175mg XR for a few years. Here and there it's been augmented with other drugs:

- Mirtazapine (californian rocket fuel) crashes my blood sugar and makes me overeat (I gained 20kg / 40lbs in 4 weeks in 2020, and 5kg in 2 days after trying it again in July)
- Higher dose venlafaxine (225mg) makes me very apethetic and hopeless, basically unmotivated and lethargic
- Abilify was interesting. At first it was the best thing ever, I got my energy I was active I started to do house chores and restart skating. But then it started getting worse - I couldn't stop mopping my house, I couldn't sit down, I would be very exhausted (especially after years of not doing anything) but couldn't sleep - the bed felt very uneasy. The sofa was uneasy. Lying on the floor was uneasy. I'd hunch into a dog pose and shake myself to sleep
- quetiapine only made me sleepy, but any sound or touch or twitching of hair made me bolt up awake. I was not sleeping over the 8 hours of sleep

Other medications like fluoxetine and escitelopram doesn't do much to my mood. ",1,1757765457.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False
