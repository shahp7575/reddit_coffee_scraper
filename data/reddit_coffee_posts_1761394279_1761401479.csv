When i looked carefully i was surprised to see my molars and premolars totally dark brown coloured mostly on the inner side. I saw a dentist and he said u have tartar build up and need scaling and i did scaling. I asked for reason but the ones he gave like smoking, excessive coffee/tea consumption, iron tablets, etc none fits me. Now a year later i have noticed brown deposition on my molars again . I don't understand whats the reason? What am i doing wrong , i brush daily and what do i do . The issue is since last time i did scaling i am experiencing sensitivity in my teeth though the doctor said it will completely go away it just didn't. What do i do now ?

1ofsd6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ofsd6a/thought_i_was_having_a_good_day/,Thought i was having a good day,"Hey everyone, 20 year old schizophrenic here (almost 21 so that's kinda cool, lol.) Anyway, essentially, I actually had a really nice night yesterday. I was with my newly adopted older Non-Binary sibling (lets call them Bee as i don't want to use anyone's real names) and my Non-Binary partner (lets call them Angel). I've known both of them since my first year of college, and when my family met Bee, they had some really bad issues going on, so we decided to adopt Bee. Essentially, we had made plans to hangout pretty much all day until 7:00 pm, in which we would go to Karoke, so we did. We went to a tea and coffee shop, walked in a park, we even played tag for about 5 minutes (mostly because we realized we all have bad cardio and got tired almost immediately, but it was still fun lol). Then we went to Karoke, and that's when everything started to go down hill. Before i continue, here's some contextI should've shared before: i was diagnosed last year in April with my schizophrenia, and it's been kind of a hard journey of self-acceptance. My schizophrenia is a mix of mostly auditory hallucinations, as well as highly negative third person thoughts that aren't my own that I label ""the voices."" I am medicated, and i switched to a higher dose of my current medication recently. I also have episodes, in which i lose control of my thoughts and mind and I'm overwhelmed with these voices and often hallucinations. I shake, i cry, whimper, and often can only speak a few words during these episodes. My family, Angel, and Angel's family are all aware that I'm schizophrenic. Now, back to the story; We were at Karoke and i started to have these negative thoughts. I was trying to use anti negative thought techniques that my therapist showed me, but they slowly just stopped working. Eventually, Angel and Bee started to notice and ask questions, to which i said i was fine for now. I wanted to try and just be ""stronger than the voices"" for once, so i just sort of shoved them down and tried to have a good time. Eventually, I started to crack and i felt tears trying to come out of my eyes, so i used the restroom. After that, i was completely fine, so i was like ""hey, i actually managed to stave off an episode, my therapist is going to be really proud of me!"" 
At least, that's what i thought. Fast forward am hour later, and it suddenly hits me without warning. I rushed out of the restaurant/bar and sat outside in the mall area, as it's inside  a mall. My episode started. Bee came out first, sat down next to me and tried to console me, then Angel's mom came out and tried to help. I couldn't really speak that much, so i just kept saying ""I'm sorry"" for a bit until i started saying Angel's name, essentially trying to communicate that i want to see them too. Angel's mom left immediately to go get them, and after a few moments, Angel and their mom were there too. Angel immediately helped console me with Bee and i started to calm down after about 5 minutes. Eventually we decided it was best for me to head home for the night as staying in the overstimulating environment would probably only make things worse, so me and Bee went home. I didn't want to leave, but most of all i didn't want to have an episode in the first place, but it always happens anyway. This is the 3rd time I've had an episode in front of my partner and i can't help but feel pitiful and small in front of them everytime. I hate the way i am and why I'm like this. It feels like i can never be truly happy for once, because everytime i get to be happy, i end up having an episode. I feel fucking insane sometimes and i then the voices constantly tell me things like ""Angel saw how weak you were, now they're going to leave you"" or ""Bee saw how pathetic you looked"" and shit like that. I feel so fucked up and i just want to know if it ever gets better",1,1761401061.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I have so many responsibilities, I'm taking 18 credits, I'm working 2 jobs that amount to 12 hours a week, I'm an RA, and I want to do personal projects after school. 

My major is 2D animation and don't get me wrong I love it, but it's so demanding. Each assignment takes hours to complete, once I worked from 6-12am straight then had class the next day. Then on top of that there's my other jobs and RA-ing, where I basically live at my job. Idk I'm drowning and what really sucks is I have nobody to fall back on.

I'm a sophomore in college and I've never held a girl's hand... How fucking pathetic is that? 

I was talking with my friends once and they were talking about past relationships and someone said, ""it's kinda said being a sophomore in highschool and never being kissed"" and I went ""hey so... Im a sophomore in COLLEGE and..."" Then they all just awkwardly sat their for a few minutes.

It feels like they never listen, they just wait till I shut up. I don't really talk to anyone about issues because nobody cares, my friends don't, they'll just change the conversation as soon as they can. My therapist isn't that much help either. Idk, but then they'll all come to me to rant about how happy they are or if they need help with something. 

I just want a hug. I just want someone to like me. 

So far I've tried and tried and tried and I only ever get my heart thrown against the concrete and shattered into thousands of pieces. And it's not like I just wait around either, I try and get myself out their. Recently I was writing an audio series at a coffee shop on campus, I got kinda into it and when I finished writing the episode I was pretty happy with how it turned out, so I leaded back in my chair and quietly said out loud ""damn I cooked with this!"" And when I looked up there was this girl just glaring me down. I've also started going to the gym again, even though I have really bad social anxiety, I wanted to go back. Idk I try to be a good person, but I just feel so invisible.

I just wish so desperately bad that I had someone I could fall back on, even for a day, justs omine who would hug me and say that's it'll all gonna be fine.

When we first brought him home, cupid wouldn't let the puppy in our bed, we like it when the dogs sleep with us. It's fine, we did other sleeping alternatives for about 2-3 weeks and cupid let the puppy in the bed. 

Everything was going great! Cupid doesnt love the new puppy. But they finally started to play together. One time the puppy climbed over cupid and he didn't care (we try not to let this happen but dogs being dogs). We saw a lot of improvement in 3 months. 

Now the problem...a few nights ago, Ben probably stepped on cupid face at night and started to growl. We turned on the lights and then cupid went for Ben. It was all bark but it was scary. We quickly separated ben and moved him into the other room and I slept with him while cupid slept in the main bed. 

3 nights ago, cupid was laying near the end of the bed, and I was a wall separating them. We slept fine that night. 

The next night cupid growled at him and was doing the classic warning signs. We moved cupid in the spare room. We don't punish him but just called his name and he got up and followed me. 
I slept with him while ben got the main bed. 

Last night....cupid growled again.......we made cupid sleep in the spare bedroom by himself. He cried a little which sucked. I really really wanted to let him back im but I was scared he would hurt the puppy. 

We are going to be doing more family time activities. Its just crazy because during the day, no issues. We are going to spend some time with ben on leash and cupid on the bed together with treats. 

But if he growls, who should we remove? My husband and i just want what's best for our small pack. Sorry for spelling and grammar mistakes. I typed this before my first cup of coffee lol",0,1761400831.0,dogs,1,0.5,False

1ofs8nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ofs8nx/i_27f_want_to_ask_out_a_guy_33m_but_im/,I [27F] want to ask out a guy [33M] but I'm overthinking it?,"**TL;DR: I'm only a month out of a 2 year relationship, so I'm overthinking my feelings for a guy. I don't want to dive into a serious relationship, but I do want to be direct and authentic about my feelings. Advice?**

  
I have been volunteering with a guy (let's call him Alex) for about a year. He's smart, funny, kind, and a good teacher (he is the one who primarily teaches me how to do the tasks we do). He goes out of his way to thank people for what they do, even though he's just a volunteer as well. Also, we're both queer (I'm unsure what flavor of queer he is, but he's very involved in pride events), and likely neurodivergent. I was in a relationship when we met, though I did develop a small crush at some point. I did my best to shut that down (mostly succeeded) and focused on my relationship.

That relationship ended about a month ago, after two years of dating, and it ended amicably. As time goes on, I am realizing that I was fairly unhappy in that relationship, and am pretty relieved not to be with her anymore. It makes sense that I developed feelings for Alex - he's very positive, whereas my ex complained a lot. He cares a lot about other people and shows it through volunteering and being active in various communities; my ex is an introvert (nothing wrong with that, but I'm probably an extrovert) and would sometimes resent how much time I spent with other people. 

Ideally, I'd spend several months out of a relationship getting to know myself. However, I'm finding myself spending a lot of time thinking about Alex, and I'm even catching myself pondering some long-term compatibility questions and making lots of assumptions about what he's like. I'm pretty sure that I'm somewhere on the Ace spectrum, as sexual attraction doesn't really happen much and never without knowing someone first (and completely dried up in my previous relationship). Suddenly though, I am incredibly attracted to him. (Sidebar, attraction is distracting and super ungrounding! *How* do people deal with that regularly? I feel like a stupid horny teenager or something.)

I'm working on being more direct and authentic in my life, and I'm starting to think that's the right call here. I've intentionally started up some conversations with Alex about his life, and he's responded positively. I complemented him on some of the cool stuff that he does, and then in a different conversation he complemented me in a similar way. I ***know*** I'm overthinking this. I think it's time for me to just be direct, but I just can't seem to find the right words. He's a musician and has invited people at our organization to his shows before, so I'm planning on going to his next one (he knows this, because I asked him when his next one was and told him I bought a ticket). I think either after that event or at our next volunteer event, I have to bite the bullet and ask him out, but nothing I can think of or find online seems right. Also, I don't actually want to dive into anything too serious. I just want him to know that I'm into him, and if the feeling is mutual, I'd love to hook up but take it emotionally slowly (probably only see each other once a week or so), and then if we're still feeling connected in a couple of months, reevaluate from there.  
  
\- *Do you want to grab <coffee/drinks> with me <before/after> <our next volunteer event/your next show>:* Not direct, unclear (especially given that we're queer so gender doesn't give hints here), keeps us in the ""are you actually interested..."" situation.  Also, how I began past relationships, and the sex was not great.

 \- *Are you seeing anyone?* : Makes intentions clearer but also, if he were poly or something, I don't think that needs to be a dealbreaker, I could reevaluate that later. I don't actually know that this gains me anything besides a tiny bit of knowledge.

\- *Do you want to go on a date?:* All response onus on him, also doesn't suggest a time/place. Also, unclear of what kind of date I'm talking about. Unclear to me what kind of date I want.

\- *What are your thoughts on friends with benefits:* I don't really know what I'm trying to do here, and I'm definitely not planning on asking this. I'm just trying to find some kind of question which is more about what I'm looking for than a generic <want to go on a date>, when a date could mean a lot of different things.

\- *<relevant compliment to what's going on>. I'm actually really into you. If the feeling is mutual, want to <insert coffee thing above>*: I mean, better, but terrifying. Also, if I were on the receiving end, even if I were into someone, I'd feel unsure of how to respond. Maybe that's fine. I think this is the best I can come up with right now

He’s 6’ tall and resting HR around 55. He was a smoker and gets winded easily but can jog 5k in 40mins with good recovery heart rate and his blood pressure is mostly normal now. 
Overall he’s not fit, for most of his life he was never exercising. 

The main problem now is for 3-4 months he hasn’t lost any weight and is fluctuating between 205-210. 

Goal weight and fitness is 180lbs and jogging the 5k in 30 to 35mins but no exhaustion to do it. 

Typical caloric intake is 1700 - 1800 see pic. 

Breakfast is 2 coffees milk & sugar 4tsps. 
Lunch is basmati rice, pork loin, romaine lettuce/tomato/bell pepper salad with Swiss cheese. 
Dinner is a tofu stir fry with a garlic yogurt dressing 
Snacks are oatmeal strawberries and Greek yogurt

When I do that, water starts to pool slightly inside the portafilter (maybe about one-tenth full) before it begins to flow out of the spouts. It’s not overflowing, but it definitely collects some water first.

Then I removed the portafilter completely and ran water straight from the group head — I noticed the water doesn’t come out evenly from the shower screen(?), i attached a video of it.

So we built something to fix job hunting!,"Hey folks, just dropping in to overshare like every other startup founder. I’m “John Doe” , not my real name, obviously. Can’t reveal that yet because, you know, we still have day jobs and our startup is currently powered by coffee, instant noodles and bootstrap money. We started JobAlchemy to help job seekers apply faster, smarter, and more confidently. Our mission is simple, make job hunting less painful by using AI to tailor every CV, reduce repetitive work, and help people actually stand out. No investors. No fancy offices.
Just two friends trying to make the job search suck a little less.

So yeah….. Last year, both my co-founder and I were jobless. I had just been let go from a startup and thought I’d take a short break. That “break” lasted about two weeks before I started losing my mind doing nothing.

So I started applying again. 
And man,I forgot how painful job hunting is.

You spend hours finding roles, editing your CV, rewriting cover letters, and filling the same forms again and again only to get ghosted. I forgot how painful job hunting is. Like, genuinely soul-sucking. Sure, this time I had GPT helping me send 10x more applications (thank you, robot intern), but the process still sucked.

At some point, I realised I had to take everything I’ve done in the last 5–6 years the late nights, the projects, the chaos and summarise it all into two pages. Two. Freaking. Pages. So I called my best friend and said, “Bro, this system is broken. Let’s fix it.”

Sounded cool, right? Like we were about to reinvent the CV and change the world.
Until we realised yeah, no. The CV format has literally existed since Da Vinci made one. The man painted the Mona Lisa and invented the resume. Respect.

But here’s the problem , there are two sides:
	1.	Recruiters: “Give me everything in one glance, I don’t have time.”
	2.	Candidates: “Please sir, let me explain why my three month internship changed me spiritually.”

Recruiters who want all your life’s work squeezed into bullet points because they get thousands of applications. Candidates who just want to explain themselves properly, hoping someone will actually read it.

So yeah, one side wants everything, the other wants nothing extra.
And somewhere your motivation to apply just dies.

We finally accepted we can’t kill the CV system it’s probably here to stay.
But we can at least make the process less painful and hopefully lot smoother. That’s the goal before we lose our sanity like everyone else on LinkedIn.

That’s how JobAlchemy started as a side project built out of frustration and curiosity.

So yeah, that’s where we’re at right now somewhere between “we’re figuring it out” and “we might go broke but at least it’ll make a good story.” Gonna start sharing everything the wins, the flops, the co-founder arguments, the “bro we need money” moments, all of it. 

That’s the update. We’re almost there, first version dropping soon. Until then, I’ll be sharing everything we’ve been through the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of building a startup while working a day job with your best friend. Fun times.

Happy to answer any questions about how we came up with the idea or where we started.",0,1761400532.0,advancedentrepreneur,1,0.5,False

We are two busy people and we would like to have a coffee machine that is efficient to use. We like that we can just turn the breville on and pour an espresso within a minute or two.

Given that we want to upgrade yet keep that flexibility/quickness, what would you guys advise?

I have a Jellyfin instance running in a Debian 13 LXC in Proxmox 9. It has been running for a while and I haven't revisited the Jellyfin settings since originally setting it up a few years ago (basically just updated it regularly).

I have the iGPU acceleration working for transcoding, but I see that the tone mapping boxes are unchecked. Looking through the [relevant documentation](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/post-install/transcoding/hardware-acceleration/intel#tone-mapping-methods), it isn't clear to me what settings I should be using.

I have an Intel Xeon E-2174G with the /dev/dri/renderD128 device passed through to the LXC.

just got a df54 grinder along with an old, cheap capresso that was gifted to us (don’t judge, most of you didn’t start with the $21,000 machines you have now)

I’m at 14g in, 19 on the df54 and ~30 sec. I get like 50-60g+ out.  (And it’s horrible tasting). I ‘think’ I should be getting like 28-30g out to try to dial in 1:2.   I’ve been trying to keep 14g in and 30 sec to reduce the variables. 

So I think this means I should grind finer and restrict flow, correct?  But when I grind finer, I get nothing out (maybe 2-3g and the puck is wet)

So how do I figure this out? 1- to make drinkable coffee. 2- getting closer to 1:2 out with it still flowing 3- what else am I doing wrong? (Yes I’m am saving for a La Marzocco KB90 3 Group, maybe Christmas from the wife)",0,1761400323.0,espresso,3,0.5,False

1ofs21u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ofs21u,Guess my OCs’/original characters’ mbti types,"Dexter Bautista / Fenrir

Dexter is a feisty individual who loves to take risks. He is described as a firecracker by his colleagues. In the battlefield, he doesn’t stay still and plan his next move—he is the first move. His way of fighting is so reckless that it stresses the living crap out of his allies. As his past-time, Dexter enjoys activities such as working out and playing basketball—anything that is physically stimulating. As a friend, he is supportive and outgoing as he encourages his friends to have fun and would even do anything to light up the vibe. Dexter is also not afraid to show affection to his friends, whether it be a hug or a hard hitting pat on the back, he loves to express his feelings. His goal is to fight for justice for people and protect them from phobias (monsters in my story) by eradicating them. He also all people deserve protection and is willing to disobey to fight for what he believes in. People find him too reckless but they don’t know that his biggest fear is being completely restricted. He values his freedom and the freedom of others. He absolutely despises phobias because they are depriving people of their freedom. 



Laurent Bordeaux / Archangel

Laurent is a soft-spoken and reserved individual. It’s hard to read his somber demeanor but a huge mess is going on inside his mind. He subtly flaunts his mesmerizing wings with false pride but deep down, he fails to love himself for who he truly is. He is a people pleaser who cares too much about what others think. “Am I too much?” “Am I too underwhelming?” Thoughts like these haunt him everyday and every night. Insecurity isn’t an unfamiliar concept to him since he’s always felt it ever since his teenage years however he is still not used to it. He does what it takes to feel useful yet nothing he does feels appreciated. Carmen, the head of the phobia hunter New York district, was the only person to make him feel worthy but even that wasn’t enough, he still sought out validation from her and from others. Whenever Carmen would look away, he hopes that she’d turn to look back to see what he’s contributing for the team. He does simple acts of service such as making coffee or carrying documents for people. Despite not loving himself, he deeply cares about others and is willing to support them in any way possible—which may be his people pleasing side but he truly cares. Despite being perceived as a dull goody two shoe, he is actually rebellious and is willing to disobey orders from authority if it doesn’t align with what he believes in. 


Mercy Patel / Sharpshooter 

Vanity, pleasure, charisma, and sharp-eyes—four things people associate with the Mercy Patel. People believe she’s a myth because of how stealthy, beautiful and deadly she is. They call her “The Sharpshooter” because of how skilled she is at sniping. Besides being a proficient sniper, she is also a well-known frequent nightclub goer who enjoys drinking, dancing, and flirting with people. She is also very fashionable and is meticulous when it comes to her appearance. Besides being a self-loving assassin, she is also a compassionate person who loves to support and help others. She always makes sure people feel comfortable with her. She even feels conscious if she rubs people the wrong way—she wants to be in good terms with everyone. She sees the beauty in things and people, and doesn’t judge with biased misconceptions. One of her flaws is that she is blinded by the silver lining instead of focusing on reality. People say she thinks life is all about having fun but deep down, she just copes with the harsh reality of life by ignoring all the problems. ",1,1761400256.0,MbtiTypeMe,2,1.0,False

On the night the sky fell in silver ropes, Elias ran toward the burning house before he knew he was running.
He had been walking home under a hush of winter stars, equations still muttering in the back of his head—fields and symmetries, the way vacuum isn’t empty but buzzing with possibility—when a red bloom opened at the end of the lane. Heat licked the dark. A cough of glass. A child’s cry like a thread thrown into his chest and pulled.
Later, he would tell himself all the good, sensible reasons: adrenaline, conditioning, stories he’d heard about what heroes do. Later, he would arrange his memory on a blackboard and give it clean names. But in the moment there was only the tug. It was not thought or plan. It was a wordless yes that arrived already chosen.
He shouldered the door with a noise that would echo for years. Smoke wrapped him. Flame wrote its fast alphabet along the ceiling. A little boy in dinosaur pajamas was standing on a chair, hands over his ears, mouth wide and white. Elias scooped him up, pressed the small heartbeat against his ribs, and stumbled backward through the hot roar. A beam fell. The floor complained. He did not consider dying until he was already outside and someone was putting a wet blanket around his shoulders and saying, “You’re mad. You could’ve—”
He looked down. Soot all over his arms. Those ridiculous dinosaurs staring from the limp sleeve draped over his arm. The boy hiccuped against his chest and then found his mother, who made a sound like a bell struck hard.
Elias sat on the curb and shook and watched the house finish its bright sentence. Sirens came late, as they do. Neighbors made a ring of helpless talk. Someone pressed a bottle of water into his hand and he drank without tasting. The boy waved at him as they were led away. Elias lifted one ash-black hand and felt his eyes burn in a new way.
That night he dreamed he was holding a mirror that did not show his face. It showed a light—soft, steady, not the knife-bright of fire but something like morning remembered. He lifted the mirror, and the light looked back. The sensation was as simple and as strange as pouring water from one glass into another and watching it remain itself. He woke with his heart ringing quietly against his ribs.
At dawn he wrote four words on the kitchen chalkboard: I saw because seen.
He stood back and frowned at the sentence as if it were a stranger who had borrowed his coat. He had to get to work. There were meetings about funding and a circuit that needed to stop heating itself to death. There was something wrong with the superconducting magnets; there is always something wrong when you want the world to behave ideally. He erased the board, drank his coffee, and walked into the day.

The lab wore its usual mask of competence, the holy hum of machines, light blinking its binary prayers. The whiteboard in his office still carried the previous day’s argument with Quinn about whether the multiverse was science or just a way of not blushing in front of fine-tuning. “You want to explain the knobs by imagining a room of a trillion knobs,” Quinn had said, amused. “If it works, it works.”
“If it works,” Elias had answered then. Now he ran his hand over the faint ghosts of their formulas and felt only hunger.
He spent the morning lecturing about vacuum fluctuations to a room of (mostly) awake students. He told them with sober delight that the ground state—the thing you’d think was nothing—seethed with almosts. He drew froth on the chalkboard, virtual pairs popping up and canceling like apologies. He said in a tone he hoped was careful and not prophetic that our best equations refuse to be empty. A hand went up and wanted to know why emptiness had rules. Elias laughed and said, “Because we are lucky enough to live in a universe where the emptiness has grammar.”
He could answer how like a craftsman. But the why kept standing in the back of the room, hat in hand.
After class, he walked out under a cold blue and felt the world too detailed. The red of a student’s scarf. The strange courage of a pigeon hopping between feet. A man in a doorway holding a paper cup as if it might warm him from the inside out if he believed hard enough. Elias put a bill in and felt the small, embarrassing thrill of being good and the larger, steady ache of inadequacy.
“Bless you,” the man said, and for one strange instant the words seemed literal—like being brushed by something old as weather.
That night, he opened books he had neglected: philosophers who demanded he slow down, poets who refused to apologize for mystery. He found himself lifting the mirror of his dream again, in memory. Inside it the light watched him gently. He whispered into the empty apartment, “Why do I feel as if the seeing is mutual?”
No answer, except the soft reply of his own breath and the refrigerator’s sigh.
He thought of the burning house and the tug, the way the world had not felt neutral when the small voice cried. The universe of equations had not disappeared. It had simply stepped back to make room for something that did not fit on his chalkboard. He did not like not fitting. He fell asleep resisting and asking and hovered a while in the place where asking becomes a kind of praise.

Weeks passed. The days moved like beads on a string. The child from the fire appeared sometimes in the grocery store or at the park, and Elias would feel shy around him, as if caught in an intimacy—two people who had nearly met their ends in each other’s presence. The boy would wave. He’d wave back.
It was winter when Quinn invited him to the desert observatory. “You need to be under a sky that made fewer choices,” she said. “Come work on the background noise. Or just breathe where it’s thin enough to let the questions through.”
They drove into a land so open the wind felt like a thought without a body. The observatory crouched on a red hill like a patient animal. At night, they opened the dome and let what was out there fall in. The microwave background sang its old, old song into metal. The sky was so full of cold fire that Elias forgot to be grave and laughed out loud and did not feel embarrassed.
They spoke of beginnings in a language that had learned to be careful with the word before. They muttered inflation and false vacua and tunneling events and all the handy magic tricks reality might have up its sleeve if you grant it sleeves. They let themselves speak of multiverses the way children speak of castles—too seriously, with an earnestness that keeps the joy from dripping away.
On the third night, after equations had done what equations could do—carved air into clean shapes and then sighed—Elias sat alone on the last concrete step before the open ground. The desert was a big listening. The instruments clicked softly as they cooled.
“Why something rather than nothing?” he said without meaning to say it out loud.
There were a thousand good ways to answer if you were allowed to avoid the question. Because if not something, then no one to ask. Because the null set is elegant, but it doesn’t throw apple blossoms in spring. Because a vacuum isn’t nothing and never was, and the first light woke because the rules said it could. He made little stacks of such answers and watched them fall.
“Why anything?” he said again, smaller.
The word that came back wasn’t carried on the air. It did not knock. It arrived like stillness arriving after a bell stops. It arrived like the memory of a name you loved as a child and had not tasted for twenty years. It arrived where his breath ended and his chest began.
I am.
He sat very still and wondered if he had finally done the thing his mother warned him about—worked himself strange. He swallowed and tasted brass.
“I am who?” he asked, almost laughing, because you do not ask wind its surname.
The answer did not elaborate. It did not echo. It simply was—as present and as quiet as a hand on a shoulder.
The universe had always been unreasonably intelligible to him, the way a face is intelligible to a child long before he knows the word mother. He had called that intelligibility a gift without thinking, and now he wondered whether gifts implied a giver or whether he was just dressing gratitude in clumsy grammar.
He walked back inside and touched the warm flank of the machine as if it were a good horse that had done a long day’s work. Quinn looked up from a screen.
“You look as if somebody told you a secret,” she said.
“Maybe,” he said, and poured coffee he did not need. He did not say the thing that was dawning on him in fearsome softness: that if Being itself were personal, then asking why is there anything? might be less like interrogating an equation and more like listening for a voice that had been speaking since the first light, and maybe earlier.
He did not like how this made his throat thick. But he liked even less the alternative—an ache that ends in a shrug.

The third fire came for Elias in a hospital room that smelled of lemon and surrender.
Mara lay in a bed that looked like a machine playing at being furniture. She had been a friend since grad school—the one who made dinners that tasted of herbs and laughter, the one who cried at documentaries about nurses, the one who said “We” when she meant “human beings” and it did not feel like a trick. A year ago she had coughed and everyone had assumed winter. Then there were scans that would not stop spelling bad news. She had lost her hair and then her balance and then the delicious lie of invulnerability.
Elias went every night. He brought small things: the smell of rain on his coat, a story about the neighbor who had painted his fence a desperate blue, a tangerine peeled with theatrical attention that made her snort. He read to her when she asked. Sometimes he said nothing and let the machines count.
“Do you ever think,” she said on a Thursday when the lemon smell was stronger, “that if I am only chemistry, chemistry is too beautiful to be only?”
He didn’t answer right away. He had decided when she got sick to stop being clever. He had decided to give her honesty without the armor of ideas.
“I think sometimes the word ‘only’ is a kind of cruelty,” he said. “As if you could measure Mozart and then say, ‘Only frequencies.’ As if listing the parts could make a whole cheap.”
Her mouth made a soft curve. “You always did love wholes.”
“I always did love you,” he said to the ceiling, because saying it at her felt like asking for something he had no right to ask for.
She laughed the broken laugh that had become theirs. Then she said, “I’m not afraid of not being. I’m afraid of not being loved. Is that silly?”
“No,” he said, and it came out fierce. “No.”
“Then maybe the same one who taught you to run into a fire will run into this,” she said. “Maybe… maybe the door isn’t locked from the outside.”
He wanted to say what door but he knew. She had always been braver than he was about naming metaphors that felt like windows.
The last night arrived without a trumpet. Mara slept in pieces, small islands of calm between weather. He sat and held her hand and told her about the meteor shower he had seen as a child and how he had been sure the sky was opening like a book. He said, “I wish we had gone to the sea again.” She said, without opening her eyes, “We will.”
Then there was a moment the machine marked and he did not need it to. He felt the world tighten, as if reality had been a fitted sheet and someone had pulled. The air became too large.
He had been present at deaths before—the family cat, a grandfather who said “well, then” and was mostly gone already—but this was different. Her absence wasn’t emptiness. It was a contour, like a hand withdrawn from water that keeps the shape for a second before forgetting. He looked at the ceiling and said in a voice that would embarrass him later, “If you are there, I don’t know how to forgive you for leaving it like this.”
No answer came that a microphone would have caught. But something in him did not crumple in the way he had expected, as if a beam had been slid under grief to keep it from flattening the house.
He dreamed that night of a garden that had grown at the bottom of the sea. Flowers waved with the tide like choir robes. A figure walked between them and the water did not trouble his hair. He was not young or old. His hands were marked in a way that made Elias ache. The figure knelt beside a seed that looked like a small, sleeping bird and covered it with sand. “Every seed must fall,” he said without moving his mouth. “But it falls into my hands.”
Elias woke with his face wet and the empty apartment not feeling empty at all. He sat up and said, because there was no point in only thinking it now, “If you are real, you must know I am not good at this.”
He waited. The refrigerator hummed like a tired choir. A distant truck mourned down the hill. He felt ridiculous and tender and very, very alive.
The mirror from that first dream returned unasked, and the light inside it looked back with a patience that hurt because he did not deserve it.

Time passed in the way time passes when you have lost something that refuses to leave. Work resumed its habits. The campus geese resumed their war with everybody. Spring shook the trees into white confetti and Elias walked through it feeling both chosen and accused.
He did what he knew how to do: he tested. He made small vows he could keep and tried them on the world. Every morning he stood at his sink and said, “If you are there, teach me to see.” He kept a notebook not of ideas but of obediences—a call returned, a small refusal to speak the easy cruelty, a coin given without pretending it was a sacrifice, the name of a person he was tempted to treat as furniture written down and honored as if it were a psalm.
Nothing exploded. He was not granted the faculty of reading leaves. But the world acquired a texture it had lacked—the way bread is bread and also mercy when someone hands it to you warm.
He met a man in the park who fed the crows and whistled a tune that made the crows tilt their heads and Elias tilt his. He met a child who asked why the sky was so heavy and then said, “It’s like it’s full of waiting,” and Elias almost sat down on the grass and cried because yes, yes. He met a woman who still folded her dead son’s shirts on Saturdays and said, “Don’t pity me. I live between the lion’s teeth and somehow I am not devoured.”
He told Quinn, in a voice like someone confessing a minor crime, that he was praying. She did not flinch.
“How?” she asked, not why.
“Like I am standing in front of a face I cannot see,” he said. “And the face is kinder than I am.”
“Does the face answer?”
“Not in sentences,” he said. “In alignments.”
She nodded as if he’d described a phenomenon she had long suspected. “Maybe reality is the face looking back,” she said. “Maybe we only learned to speak equations so we wouldn’t die of direct attention.”
He laughed and then stopped because the laughter was too close to something else.
They worked. They argued about noise in the data. They drank coffee that tasted like burnt almonds. They went to a lecture about the measure problem and after it Elias wrote in his notebook, I do not trust an infinity that has never loved anything. He did not show it to anyone.

One evening in late summer, he walked to the hill above the city where teenagers leave their first names in chalk and old men argue about football with a courtesy that passes for love. The lights of the streets made a honeycomb of sense. Far beyond, the dark outline of the reservoir hinted at a different order—the way water holds the moon like a secret. He thought about the three fires that had brought him here: the house, the desert, the bed where Mara had not been anymore and somehow still was.
He tried to assemble an argument he could hand himself like a folded letter. He told himself about moral intuition and evolutionary stories and why “useful” is not the same as “true.” He told himself about the disconcerting miracle of mathematics mapping the world, how unreasonable it is for reality to fit our frames. He told himself about dying and the scandal of caring, and how grief is ridiculous if we are only a brief coincidence of elements and how nevertheless we care and how perhaps a ridiculous thing can be truer than a neat one.
He ran out of telling. He stood.
“Here is what I know,” he said to the air that did not need his list. “I ran into fire because something in me would have broken if I hadn’t. I keep hearing a voice that is not a hallucination because it does not flatter me; it calls me awake. Death came and still I feel the contour of my friend as if reality remembers her on purpose. And everywhere I turn, the world wears a grammar that looks suspiciously like generosity.”
The city exhaled. A dog barked twice. He felt silly and holy.
“If you are only the face I make for mystery, then I am talking to myself and that is a sadness I don’t know how to carry. If you are there—if you are the ground of the grammar and the giver of the tug and the one who walks gardens at the bottom of the sea—then I will learn to say your name without using it as a weapon.”
He waited. He almost expected theatrics—a warm wind, a tear of cloud. He received instead the exact world: a moth bumbling at his sleeve, the metallic taste that means rain is walking toward town, a little ache behind the eyes that was not grief this time but its cousin—joy catching him unawares and shy about it.
A figure came into view at the bottom of the hill, pushing a squeaking wheelbarrow. Elias watched the way the man’s hands held the handles, not like tools but like the edges of a beloved book. As the figure approached, the wheelbarrow stopped squeaking, as if it remembered something.
“Evening,” the man said. He wore a coat the color of late leaves and a hat like you see in paintings of people who do not care whether you see them.
“Evening,” Elias said.
“Looks like rain,” the man said.
“So they say,” Elias said.
They stood together and looked at the city the way old friends look at photographs. The man set the wheelbarrow down and Elias saw it held a coil of rope and a spade and a little sack of seeds with a picture of a tree printed on it.
“You plant?” Elias asked, because it was easier than asking Who are you.
“I mend,” the man said. “And sometimes I plant so there’s something to mend later. I am sentimental that way.”
They shared the small quiet that belongs to people who know each other without names.
“I lost a friend,” Elias said, surprising himself.
“I know,” the man said with a softness that made Elias’s throat hurt. “She taught you to taste peaches as if they were from the first tree.”
Elias turned his head slowly. “Yes.”
The man looked out over the lights. “I was there when she was born. I will be there when you die.”
“Will you be here,” Elias asked, and he hated the child in his voice, “for the parts in between?”
“I am here,” the man said. “But I am not just here. The here-ness you feel is a courtesy I pay because I like to be specific. I am also the reason there is a here to be.”
“You are the voice,” Elias said. He did not mean to; the words walked out of him on their own legs. “You are the I am.”
The man’s smile was not proud. It was almost embarrassed, like someone caught at a kindness they had hoped to keep quiet. “I am,” he said.
Elias wanted to step back and fall on his face and laugh all at once.
“There are many stories about you,” he managed. “Some of them make you small. Some of them make you cruel. Some of them make you too neat.”
The man tipped his head. “There are many stories about wind, too. People who do not like to be pushed invent reasons to fear a breeze.”
“Why so hidden?” Elias said. “Why not write your name on the sky with those silver ropes?”
The man picked up one of the seeds and rolled it between finger and thumb until it clicked. His hands were marked with scars—not ugly, not loud, simply honest. Something in Elias recognized them with a tenderness that felt borrowed.
“If I arrive like thunder, you kneel because you can’t help it,” the man said. “If I arrive like a gardener, you may love me. I prefer the second, because it lets us be friends.”
Rain began in soft coins.
Elias swallowed. “Do you forgive me,” he asked, “for making reality into a puzzle so I could postpone saying thank you?”
“I do not forgive you,” the man said. Elias flinched. The man smiled. “Because there is nothing to forgive. You could not have studied the grammar if I had not taught you letters. Bring me your puzzles. Bring me your thank you. Bring me your anger when I am quiet in rooms where you want me to sing.”
The rain gentled the dust. Somewhere a child shrieked with the delight of being allowed outside during weather. The man lifted the wheelbarrow handles.
“Will you fix the squeak?” Elias asked, even though it had already stopped.
The man grinned. “It remembers,” he said. “It just forgets, now and then.”
He pushed the barrow up the path. Elias watched him go and felt the three fires inside him banked and warm: the tug toward the good, the voice beneath being, the promise that falling is not the end of seeds.
He stood until the rain made him foolish and went home and wrote on the kitchen board again, this time without erasing:
I saw because seen.
 I am because I AM.
 Every seed must fall, and every seed is held.
He lived differently. Not spectacularly. Not with the kind of drama that writes itself into songs. He apologized to a colleague without needing to win. He took soup to the woman who folded shirts on Saturdays. He sat with the man in the doorway and did not pretend the coins were a solution. He gave away a coat he had liked too much and discovered that liking something exactly the right amount makes it better. He did not stop loving equations; he loved them more, the way you love a map more after you have walked the land.
Sometimes the mirror returned. Sometimes it did not. Sometimes the voice came like a bell; sometimes like quiet. Sometimes the world felt mechanical and he was tempted to be small. He learned that being tempted to be small is the ordinary human way of protecting oneself from awe. He learned, slowly, how to let awe be frightening without making it into a god that eats.
Years later, a child asked him, “Is the world real or a dream?”
“Yes,” he said, and the child laughed and threw a ball and he threw it back. He wanted to say: It is the kind of dream that can bleed and bake bread and die and stand up again and say your name.
On the anniversary of the fire, he walked past the place where the house had been. A small garden grew there now—municipal kindness, lamb’s ear and lavender, a bench with a plaque. He sat and read the name of a donor who would never know him. He thought about the boy in the dinosaur pajamas and hoped he was reading books with dinosaurs who did not burn. He thought about Mara and the seed at the bottom of the sea. He thought about the man with the wheelbarrow and the way the squeak had stopped as if rusty things could remember grace.
A maple leaf landed upside down on his knee and shivered like a red fish. He turned it over gently. The underside was paler, veined with the intelligence of water.
He whispered, to no one and to the one, “I am grateful to have been asked to love.”
The wind moved through the leaves the way a hand moves through a child’s hair. Somewhere, perhaps on a hill, perhaps beyond hills, a gardener pushed a wheelbarrow that did not complain, and seeds clicked in a sack like small promises.
And if you had stood there with Elias and asked him, like a scientist, “What changed?” he would have said what is true and will remain true when our machines are dust: “The rules did not loosen.

He stood and walked into the evening with his hands empty of proofs and full of work. The city’s lights came on one by one like thoughts remembered. The rain had washed the air clean. He breathed it and felt watched—not by a critique but by care.
The last thing he heard before the night closed like a book was a wheel somewhere, very far away, not squeaking at all.

I just wanted to share a little story about my financial struggles. I’m 28 and have been living paycheck to paycheck for years. Every month felt like a battle rent, bills, groceries, and suddenly some unexpected expense would ruin everything.

A few months ago, I decided to try something small. I started writing down everything I spent, even small things like coffee or snacks. It was surprising to see how quickly small amounts add up. Then, I opened a tiny separate savings account and started putting just $10–$20 a week into it. At first, it didn’t feel like much, but over time it added up, and it gave me a small sense of security.

I also tried freelancing online using skills I already had writing, simple data entry, and helping friends with social media. It wasn’t a lot, but every little bit helped. I’m still not rich, but I feel less stressed now. I have a small emergency fund, I can pay bills on time, and I finally feel like I have some control over my money.

Key takeaway: Small, consistent steps matter. Track your spending, save even a little, and look for safe ways to earn extra income. It makes a real difference.

tl;dr: Living paycheck to paycheck was hard. Tracking expenses, saving small amounts, and doing small side work helped me feel in control of my finances.",2,1761400089.0,povertyfinance,2,1.0,False

1ofryua,https://www.reddit.com/r/I_DONT_LIKE/comments/1ofryua/idl_that_showing_basic_care_for_your_girlfriend/,IDL that showing basic care for your girlfriend automatically gets labeled as “simping”,"I genuinely don’t get how modern dating culture got this twisted.

I’ve been in a few relationships, nothing crazy, just normal, healthy relationships where I show effort.  
If my girlfriend likes a certain dessert, I’ll pick it up for her.  
If we’re out, I open doors, grab her drink, pull out a chair, that’s just me being considerate. It’s not some strategic attempt to earn “girlfriend points.” It’s literally how I show affection.

But the second someone sees it, the comments start flying:  
“Bro you’re simping too hard.”  
“She’s got you on a leash.”  
“You keep doing that and she’s gonna walk all over you.”

The most ridiculous moment? I was at a coffee shop carrying two cups for my girlfriend, and some random guy I’ve never met laughed and said, “Dude, are you her boyfriend or her butler?”

That’s when it hit me: this isn’t about relationships anymore, it’s about performance. There’s a social pressure where affection is treated as weakness, and distance is treated as strength. If you care, you lose. If you’re cold and detached, you “have the upper hand.”

It’s not even about whether your relationship is healthy or reciprocal. These people don’t care if your partner shows love back, they only care whether you look “dominant enough” in some imaginary competition.

Somewhere along the way, basic kindness turned into a red flag. Expressing love is now seen as lowering your value. And honestly? This mindset is destroying genuine intimacy. It forces men to hide affection out of fear of being mocked.

If your entire relationship is just two people pretending not to care so they don’t “look soft,” then what’s the point of being in a relationship at all? That’s not love, that’s two people protecting their ego.",7,1761400026.0,I_DONT_LIKE,2,1.0,False

Factories once filled with workers stood empty. Storefronts on Main Street were boarded up, and the winter wind that swept through the Genesee River carried not just snow, but sorrow.

In a cracked apartment complex on Lyell Avenue — its walls tagged with graffiti and its hallways echoing with the hum of flickering lights — lived a man named **Derek Mullin**.

Derek was 32 years old. Once, he’d dreamed of becoming a stand-up comedian, someone who could make people forget their pain for just a few minutes. But lately, even he had forgotten how to laugh.

He sat on his sagging couch, the glow of his old laptop illuminating stacks of unpaid bills.  
A half-empty coffee mug sat beside him, and on the floor lay torn pages of his old joke notebooks.

Outside, sirens wailed through the night. Rochester had grown dangerous — crime, homelessness, and desperation ruled the streets. Derek had been attacked twice in the past month. The scars on his cheek were reminders of how low things had fallen.

That night, snow began to fall. Derek lay on his mattress, staring at the cracked ceiling, whispering his final thought before sleep:

At 3:17 a.m., the **Catalyst Wave** struck.

A shimmering aurora swept across the skies of New York State, invisible to most eyes but rich with power that carried through the very molecules of life. In that run-down apartment, the air thickened with a pulse of golden light. Derek stirred, murmuring, as something ancient and unknown seeped into his DNA.

By morning, the snow had stopped.

When Derek woke up, he felt *alive*. His body hummed with warmth. His thoughts were sharp — clearer than ever before. He looked in the mirror and noticed something odd: his eyes had faint streaks of **neon color**, swirling faintly when he laughed.

He picked up his old joke notebook, flipped through the pages, and began to write again. The pen seemed to glide effortlessly. Every word sparkled with humor, rhythm, and *truth*.

That night, Derek took a chance — he walked to **Comedy at the Carlson**, the biggest comedy club in Rochester.

The manager, a skeptical man named Vince, frowned as Derek approached.

When Derek stepped on stage, the audience was small and cold. But as soon as he opened his mouth, laughter rippled through the crowd like lightning.

He discovered that when he performed outdoors, the lights around him bent and flickered like carnival colors. The snow melted faster where he walked. People who came near him said they felt *lighter*.

One night after a show, Vince pulled him aside.

But the government began to take notice. The **Catalyst Division**, a special branch of S.H.I.E.L.D., was monitoring every individual who showed signs of the X-gene’s mutation.

One night, as Klown walked home through the snow, he was stopped by two figures in black coats.

The agents reached for him — but Klown smiled. A wave of laughter echoed from nearby rooftops, almost as if the sound itself became *energy*. The agents stumbled back as a burst of colorful light erupted, sending them tumbling into a snowbank.

And with that, he vanished in a swirl of carnival-colored mist.

# The Movement of Joy

By spring, unemployment in Rochester had dropped.  
How? Because people were smiling again. Inspired by Klown, locals formed the **Laugh to Live Movement** — free performances, street comedy, and public murals filled the streets with color.

Even those struggling began to find hope. Laughter became power, not weakness.

Klown performed in the open air at the Genesee Riverfront Park. Thousands gathered, cheering his name. Reporters called him *“The Laughing Light of Rochester.”*

But S.H.I.E.L.D. wasn’t the only one watching.

Deep beneath the ruins of Midtown, a shadowy organization known as **Hydra Nova** had been experimenting with the darker side of the Catalyst. They saw Klown not as a symbol of hope — but as a *battery*. His laughter-fueled energy could power their machines for decades.

Their leader, **Dr. Grimmson Vale**, spoke from the shadows:

# The Battle of Laughter and Shadows

One evening, Klown performed his biggest show yet — a live broadcast from Rochester’s **Eastman Theatre**. The crowd roared with excitement, unaware that Hydra Nova agents were already among them.

Midway through his set, the power cut out. Darkness fell.

Then came a voice through the speakers.

Klown grinned, even in the dark.

The laughter from the audience — even scared — sparked within him. A cascade of neon color burst from his chest, illuminating the entire theater like a cosmic circus.

Hydra Nova’s machines cracked and melted under the sheer force of joy. Dr. Vale stumbled back as Klown’s aura surrounded him.

>

He snapped his fingers — and the villain was trapped in a prism of pure light, echoing with endless laughter.

The crowd exploded with cheers.

# The Legacy of Klown

After that night, Klown’s fame spread far beyond Rochester. He joined forces with other Catalyst-born heroes — like **Krozover**, **Lady Luck**, and **Kentury Kid** — to form a new kind of alliance: not built on strength, but on *hope*.

When asked in an interview what his secret was, Klown smiled at the camera and said:

So, I went down to 20 clicks and there was some resistance with pressure of about 4 bars but still not sufficient to pull a good espresso shot. It's very weird since 20 clicks is too fine and I can't go any lower.

Got about 280k invested across four different accounts right now. When I started getting serious about this two years ago I built this massive spreadsheet to track everything, I'm talking tabs for each account, formulas calculating my savings rate, projections based on different return scenarios, the whole nine yards.

Spent hours every week updating it. Like I'd sit down Saturday morning with coffee and go through each brokerage statement line by line. Kind of became my weekend ritual. I felt productive even though deep down I knew it was taking way too much time.

Then about six months ago I had this moment where I stepped back and realized I was tracking all this data but not really learning anything useful from it. My spreadsheet told me my net worth went up or down but I couldn't actually see patterns or understand what was working and what wasn't.

The breaking point was when I tried to figure out if my returns were beating the market. Spent three hours trying to calculate it properly and still wasn't sure if I did the math right. That's when I knew something had to change.

I still use notion for my main planning stuff but I stopped trying to track everything manually. Found a few tools that handle the calculation part automatically so I can actually focus on the decisions instead of the data entry. Still check my progress but now it's like once a week for ten minutes instead of hours of spreadsheet work.

My advice for anyone starting the fire journey is don't fall in love with your tracking system. The goal is financial independence not becoming an excel expert. Track what matters and automate the rest.

The Journey can feels so grey (like her hair) sometimes…..

1st half ~

I really like these shots of Elaina flying, like, so free and chill vibe, and she makes it looks so easy riding the broom haha (We’ll see more of her driving skills in ep 5 !)

Elaina met some girls on a fields and she gave her some beautiful flowers ! She asked Elaina to give the flowers to anyone in the Country she headed to, the flowers girl just want to give 
them to anyone (seems cute co far nothing bad gonna happens for sure !)

Elaina arrived and the guard told her to stop, even touching her broom ! (What with this homie dissing my girl ! What an ass hahaha)

Then some older guard dude came and told her that the guard dude’s sister just disappeared not so long ago and that’s why he was like that (yeah well, understandable) The flowers given to Elaina was dangerous and burned immediately after she gave it to the older guard (too bad that was a beautiful flowers)

Elaina went back to the fields again and unfortunately the first guard dude and his sister became a victim of the mutated flowers and soon the people of that country might be victims too (she saw that and dipped immediately haha) 

Some people find this actions of Elaina to be controversial, but personally I kinda like this lmao she’s just a traveller anyway.

2nd half ~ 

Emile-san’s haircut is terrible lmao, he looks like a dork with that hair (but it fits I guess)

But I like Nino’s haircut ! (The uneven fringe is anime nonsense, but I like it haha)

I really Elaina (fake)expression “Oh my ! You’re rich aren’t you !” That moments was cute from a greyish episode.

The food looks amazing as always, Elaina said she already ate breakfast a while (knowing Elaina, she probably just ate some breads and coffee, don’t worry Elaina, you still got a lot of room for heavier Lunch haha)

Nino broke the jar and Emile’s asshole dad lash out immediately, in front of a guest ! (How is this dude a village leader ? But looking at real life it’s accurate haha) Elaina was so ready to whoop his ass haha but fixing a jar was nothing for her ! 

Emile showed the happiness magic to Nino and she broke down crying (don’t know what happened to her life after that moment) 

Elaina left and that meeting with them reminds her of a sad story she read (Elaina think things probably not gonna end well for Nino)

This episode was rather depressing compared to the first 2 episodes, in episode 1 we see the start of Elaina’s journey with happy vibe and in episode 2 we see the meeting of Elaina and Saya. 

And while the first two episodes we have some 
sad moments like Elaina crying and Saya talking about her loneliness, but it was still hopeful vibe. Episode 3 left me with a sad vibe, but it’s still great tho ! I like some greyish color too ! (like Elaina’s hair haha)

1ofroz4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ofroz4,"Learning graphic/logo design, looking for advice on how to improve!","I've been getting really into graphic design the last few months, particularly for logos! No schooling or anything but I'm having a lot of fun learning as I go. I'm using Inkscape as I don't have money for Illustrator (I'm a full-time student and my partner is supporting a family of 5 on his income). I'm pretty happy with some of these but feel like I definitely have a lot of room for improvement overall, so I'm just here hoping for some feedback!

  
The first set are just practice logos I made for fake companies - the top two are for a fake spa (I was going for a cucumber, my partner didn't get that from them so I'm not sure if I didn't do it right?). The coffee bean is probably my least favorite here, and the photography one is my most recent and I think my best! I've thought about adding a viewfinder and a button to the camera to make it read more ""camera"" but trying to keep from overdoing it.

The second one was actually my first logo and what got me into it - my mom started real estate and I made her a logo. She just wanted something black and pink and feminine.

The last one was for my grandma, and is actually intended as a sign, not a logo (so it will be larger). She requested an old lady with white curly hair doing hair, paper and packaging crafts with the name on a sign behind her. I simplified as much as I could, and I was going for a ""made of paper pieces"" kind of vibe here, so overall I'm relatively happy with this one!",4,1761399272.0,logodesign,7,1.0,False

Whenever I talk to guys, I make sure it stays in the talking stage and doesn’t proceed further because the concept of getting physical scares me. 

There was a time where I’d text and call a guy for close to 3 months and not go on dates with him because I was just so nervous and would get anxiety attacks even thinking about being alone with a guy lol. Here’s the thing though - I REALLY liked him and was attracted to him and I wanted to be with him so idk what even stopped me? Why I sabotaged something I really wanted? I worked on that and forced myself to go on dates with guys to grab coffee / food. However, I just cannot even imagine going beyond talking and being friendly. I literally made a guy wait for 10 dates before giving him a peck and even then I was literally so nervous while doing it. 

I’m at an age where 90% of my friends are dating, a lot of my seniors and cousins are getting married, some are even announcing pregnancies but here I am… scared of intimacy.

If you are younger it might seem impossible to acquire wealth when much of it is appears locked away in the accounts and real estate of older folks. ( You who believe that should stay away from the FIRE sub, Financially Independent, Retire Early).

Socialism must look like a good answer to young people. “ How can I get rich working as a barista at Starbucks? I know, get rid of Starbucks stock holders, and start paying me $40/hr to peddle coffee. If we baristas were offered a vote on managing this shop, we would all vote ourselves higher wages and a 32 hour work week. We could bring in( used specifically because no one would be “ hired” anymore) more people too, with if we worked less. We would be spreading the wealth!”

Also it could be seen that free housing would go arm in arm with a Socialist econ. I don’t believe free housing is a strict socialist position plank, but it links well with Socialism, and many younger people  think they have no chance at home ownership.

1ofriuo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ofriuo,Chocolate vanilla coffee sugar free sweet sourdough.,"Chocolate Coffee Sourdough (Sweetened with Stevia!) 🍫☕️

Hey everyone! I wanted to share a sweet sourdough variation I’ve been experimenting with. It’s rich, aromatic, and sweetened with stevia instead of sugar. Think of it like a dessert-leaning sourdough that still has that classic tang.


Ingredients
500 g flour
100 g active sourdough starter
50 g unsweetened cacao powder
8 g instant coffee
1 tsp sugar-free vanilla bean paste
10 g salt
100 g sugar-free chocolate chips
Stevia to taste (depends on your brand and preference)


Method
Mix the wet ingredients first.
Add the salt, cacao powder, then flour. Mix until combined.
Let it autolyze for 1 hour.
Do 3 sets of stretch & folds, spaced 40 minutes apart.
Bulk ferment until ready (I go by dough feel, not time.)
Shape, place into a floured banneton, and cold proof for at least 12 hours.
Bake straight from the fridge at 450 °F in a preheated Dutch oven: 45 minutes with the lid on, you dont want a hard crust on this one.
Let it cool completely before slicing, otherwise, it’ll turn into a gooey chocolatey mess.


It’s got that deep chocolate-coffee aroma, a soft crumb, and just the right amount of sweetness. Perfect with a little butter or cream cheese on top.",6,1761398796.0,Sourdough,2,1.0,False

anyways. lets just say: i am really tired about the general mindset to make every activity boil down to ''how and when do we spend money''

its something i notice more and more every year, that for most people ''lets meet'' ''lets plan some activity'' or any sort of gathering always comes down to, where to spend money. usually going to the restaurant, going to the cinema, go drink a coffee in some cafe and so on. i am so tired of it and it kind of also results in the fact i cant even enjoy these things anymore because the entire private life of people is nowadays ''spending money''

why the hell do we need to meet at a restaurant and pay like 30 Euros for a freaking dish... 

what about... instead we just meet at my place or at your place with a few people... and actually cook ourselves and actively DO something... instead of spending money so we can consume stuff.

meet at a caffee to drink an overpriced coffee for 6 Euros... well... you are aware that i have a coffee maker at home right? what about we just instead meet, drink a coffee at home and then go to the local park and play some badminton or whatnot... costs pretty much zero money... 

no, i dont feel like going to that new bar and spending 13 Euros to try that new cocktail either... what about we just meet at my place, mix a few cocktails outself and then hit the sofa and chill while listening to music?

hey its autumn... we could also just go to the forest to collect things like ''Kastanien'' and whatnot and then craft some DIY autumn decoration while having some fresh tea or something. 

just a a few quick examples. but the list goes on and on and on.

it feels like the current society has absolutely no clue what to do...other then spending money. the entire social activity bubble revolves around ''going somewhere to spend money'' There are like a billion different things people can do, with what they have, getting creative... like i dont know, we could get a drawing canvas, put on a bob ross dvd and just paint along while having some smalltalk or whatever... or howmany other things there are to do...but instead everyone is like: ''in what cafee do we meet?'' ''in what restaurant do we eat?'' ''in what club do we go?''  ... so we can spend more money.

Then I lost 60% of my income in a single 3-sentence email.,"A couple of years ago, I was on top of the world. My business was consistently pulling in around $4k a month, which felt like a fortune. I was in that classic entrepreneur hustle-culture bubble, you know? Every guru online is screaming 'SCALE! GROW! 10X YOUR BUSINESS!' and I was drinking all of the Kool-Aid. I felt invincible, like every decision I made turned to gold. I had this one client, a big one, who had been with me from the early days. They were my rock, my proof that I'd 'made it.'

Then one Tuesday morning, it all fell apart. I was sipping my coffee, scrolling through my inbox, when I saw an email from that client. The subject line was an innocent 'Checking in.' I opened it without a second thought, expecting a routine request. But the words on the screen felt like a punch to the gut. They were 'restructuring,' and their 'new direction' didn't include my services anymore. It was three sentences long. Three sentences that vaporized more than half of my monthly income instantly. The coffee cup felt heavy in my hand, the room went quiet, and all I could hear was a loud ringing in my ears. I had just gone from 'successful business owner' to 'on the verge of failure' in the time it took to read an email.

The panic that followed was suffocating. I spent the next few days in a daze, frantically checking my bank account, creating spreadsheets with terrifying hypotheticals, and just staring at the ceiling at 3 a.m. Every 'rah-rah' motivational post I saw on LinkedIn felt like a personal attack. I felt like a complete fraud. All that confidence I had built up crumbled, replaced by a gnawing anxiety. How could I have been so stupid? How could I let one client become such a huge pillar of my business that its removal could cause the whole structure to collapse?

But once the dust settled, that catastrophe became the most important lesson I've ever learned. It forced me to stop chasing the ghost of 'more' and start appreciating the stability I had. It taught me the critical importance of diversification—never again will I let one client hold that much power over my livelihood. I rebuilt, slowly but surely, with a new focus on creating a resilient, stable business rather than one built for vanity metrics. It was a brutal, painful lesson, but it turned me into a much smarter and more grateful entrepreneur.

And is this a better use of taxpayer dollars than fixing schools and fighting fentanyl?,"https://preview.redd.it/kt0623kyd9xf1.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4ffe8499801d8a374e3e88c2c8ab3430fe1beb2

***Photo above*** *- The Big Promiski, Hey dude, you're in luck - Future NYC Mayor Mamdani plans to open government run supermarkets, to solve the affordable grocery crisis.*  
  
NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani thinks the city should build a bunch of supermarkets and staff them with city employees (see link below.) Because city employees like teachers and police have absolutely nailed their duties, and the city is ready to conquer strange new worlds like coffee, and beef inflation.  
  
City owned grocery stores will undoubtedly feature higher wages, lower prices, and no coca cola (giant soft drinks are already banned at city movie theaters.) This campaign promise isn’t about prices and wages though. There are “food deserts” in NYC – places where legitimate supermarket chains fear to tread. Mamdani has promised to rush in and fix all that.  
  
The problem – according to greedy corporations – is rampant shoplifting, drug dealing night and day at the corner, and homeless encampments on sidewalks blocking the entrance. Of course, Mamdani has discovered some clever hack to solve all this, right? Stand by for details.  
  
Nobody knows how many city owned grocery stores are planned. What the prices will be, and how much all those new municipal workers there will be paid. I expect their pay will include healthcare from day one, a city pension plan, and the “can’t get fired unless you’re convicted of a felony” clause– the same deal most teachers have, In any case, the eventual taxpayer cost of ""Gotham Groceries.gov"" is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside of an enigma. We need to trust the government on this one. Whatever this ends up costing, it will be paid for by higher taxes on corporations, millionaires, and landlords. I’m sure they have no plans to move away.  
  
Candidate Mamdani - sincerely - deserves credit here. He's trotting out a tried and true, very sophisticated political playbook. Step one - Identify the most important things to single issue voters. Step two - promise to fix them, Step 3 - announce details will follow later.  
  
Mamdani will also freeze all rents (hurrah!) make all buses free, offer free municipal child care, in addition to opening all those new grocery stores. If – as a new yorker – you don’t feel rent and childcare is outrageously expensive, then you must already be a millionaire.  
  
We know this sort of campaign chicanery works, because voters always buy into it, year after year. Things like building a wall and making Mexico pay for it. Cancelling all student loan debt. A health program that cuts your cost in half, and solves the national debt problem at the same time. Bring high paying factory jobs back to America by imposing a 100% tariff on whichever nation gets hit next on the dart board. Solve global warming with Tesla subsidies.  
  
If you believed any of those promises, you’re not evil - just a typical American. You should migrate to New York City, vote for Mamdani, and enjoy your free childcare, affordable housing and clean, crime-free paradise. Somebody else will pay for it. You only need to have faith.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

1ofreu7,https://i.redd.it/r5brujmwa9xf1.jpeg,The Fanta Experiment,"Oh boy, this one is good. 

Not quite Fanta, but since almost every country has its own recipe and slight flavour variation, I'm calling this one a win... It's a really refreshing orange drink with hints of citrus on the finish thanks to the lemon and lime.

To make 500ml of cordial, you'll need:

* 116ml water
* 400g white sugar
* 111ml filtered orange juice
* 26ml filtered lemon juice 
* 13ml filtered lime juice
* 3.4g citric acid (gives a nice citrus tang)
* 1.6g malic acid (provides a softer, smoother, and longer-lasting sourness)
* 1g ascorbic acid (antioxidant to prevent discolouration of the juices)
* 0.5ml [preservative solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig754vu8F9U) (as you're using fruit juices)
* 0.5-1ml orange essence (4.5ml orange essential oil to 25.5ml 95% alcohol)
* orange food colouring (optional)

Method:

* Filter the juices through a coffee filter (measure out 2-5ml more than the recipe calls for to allow for some soaking into the paper).
* Mix the water, orange, lemon and lime juices and heat gently until around 50-60C.
* Stir in the sugar and keep stirring until fully dissolved.
* Add in the acids and preservative until fully incorporated.
* Allow the mix to cool and add the colouring if using.
* Once fully cool, add the orange essence and mix well.
* Allow to age for 24-48 hours.
* Dilute 1:5 or 1:7 in carbonated water to drink.

Fanta in the UK contains orange juice from concentrate (3.7%) and citrus fruit from concentrate (1.3%), so I calculated the rough amount of fresh juice to use based on the final drink having those percentages in it. The lemon and lime amounts are based on personal preference for a nice balance to those flavours, so you can play about with them yourself to get the drink to your own taste.

I also added concentrated orange from the flavour library I've built up - you can add lemon and lime as well to boost those flavours if you like, but don't go over 3-4ml of added oil & alcohol as it may overpower the drink.

If you don't want to use preservatives, you can pasteurise the cordial and keep it in the fridge once opened. It should last you up to a couple of months.",9,1761398492.0,Cordials,0,1.0,False

I thought I was finally going to have them all make it to adulthood, but like TWO nights before finishing, boom, Agave was lost to an unknown fate. Also that's the first time I had it happening because I haven't really played that much.

Around the start of growing pups, Hail and Pine left together, which was kinda sad bc they were both amazing hunters. I kept track of them and I found out Hail is now leader of ""Eureka Springs"" with a mate named Breve (I was naming that pack after coffees lol). I hope I don't have to kill them :/

Pine left the map with her mate. Around the middle of young hunters, Stag left alone too. 

Also one day, a wolf from a pack I had dissolved, whose name was Coal, approached and almost managed to court Pebble (I was starting to hear music?), but then we were attacked by another pack and he left :/

My goal is to have my wolf or his mate die of old age because I have never gotten that far in this game. I'm really enjoying it, and I hope you are too! ",6,1761398409.0,WolfQuestGame,0,1.0,False
1ofrdrx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ofrdrx,Three Days with Yamamasa Koyamen's Kaguraden,"Since starting my adventures with matcha all the way back in May of this year, I've been exposed to a variety of brands and cultivars, and while I feel as if I've only scratched the surface, I'm still pleasantly surprised when a new tin blows my socks off, making me appreciate the magic of this green dust all that much more. 

Described as ""a full-bodied, characteristic, intensively robust, velvety soft koicha with an exceptionally long aftertaste which first reveals a range of chocolate and coffee aromas, followed by sweet, creamy notes, finishing in light, floral notes,"" Kaguraden by Yamamasa Koyamaen comes as advertised, presenting a deep vegetal aroma upon first open (and even now, honestly) giving off V8 vibes, which is almost always a sign of a deep, rich experience to come. 

The color is a bright green, with a bit of a yellow tinge, but not in any way dull like one would find in a lesser grade matcha, so the quality is certainly evident upfront. This tin was purchased three months ago, and is part of the 2024 harvest, but has been stored in a cool space away from any real light (more on this later). The clumps give away that this is a finely-milled matcha that must be sifted to provide the best experience; sifting was a breeze with the fine emerald particles moving through the sieve with relative ease. Upon closer look, you can appreciate the fine grind that with a touch of water turns into a lovely deep green paste in preparation for the koicha soon to come. 

As with all thicker teas, I brewed this one at 176F with four grams of Kaguraden to 30mL of water. The initial sip of koicha was a silky burst of umami with zero astringency or bitterness. Make no mistake, this matcha is meant primarily for koicha and holds itself up admirably against top-of-the-line matchas such as Ippodo's Kanza. 

Over the course of three days, I employed the same combo of producing a koicha first and then making usucha of what remained, and for the first two days, I was a bit underwhelmed with the usucha, as the whisk wasn't producing the level of microfoam befitting a match of this grade. For me, the creamy notes are always going to be heightened by the microfoam, so on day three, today, I chose to forgo the silken pleasure of a koicha and went straight for an usucha, and in doing so was able to produce a lovely and thick microfoam that made the usucha soar as a creamy, sweeter delight, making this overall review overwhelmingly positive. 

In all experiences, the thing that stood out most for me is how Kaguraden lingers with a strong and enjoyable aftertaste that makes the whole experience contemplative, creating an instant eagerness for the next bowl.

And no, I did not make a latte of this, and I would suggest that no one else does either. This is premium tea that deserves to be consumed so that the full flavor of this robust matcha can be enjoyed. 

I will however, share thoughts later once I try this Americano-style with coconut water.

Speaking of premium, Kaguraden comes in third on YK's depth chart, so I wouldn't recommend this to beginners, and as I mentioned before, I ordered this just three months ago, paying $54 for 30g from an approved reseller (The Steeping Room). Today, the cheapest you can find Kaguraden (if you can find it at all) is at $82, with other resellers going as high as $105. While I enjoyed this experience immensely, I can't justify the price when there are similar experiences such as the aforementioned Kanza or Ummon that can provide similar flavor for a cheaper (for now) price. 

Let's face it, we are all going to overpay for good matcha, so if we do so, we must reserve those splurge purchases for even better matcha, which isn't to say that Kaguraden doesn't qualify, the line between great and superior is a thin one that requires being smarter about one's spending.

That said, if you are well versed in your matchas and want to elevate your experience, find a can of Kaguraden, and be amazed, but then move on...for your wallet's sake.",6,1761398407.0,MatchaEverything,0,1.0,False

As it stands, I don’t really want to go on a vacation again because it feels like a waste of money.

My stomach has been really bad, I’ve felt on the verge of being sick multiple times a day. Every time I’ve used the bathroom it’s been totally fine. Anyway I just had a drink of decaf coffee and when it hit my stomach I felt like I was about to v*, not anxiety but actually. I haven’t been anywhere since we got home from holiday or around anyone, so I don’t have a bug, but I’m starting to worry somethings wrong with my stomach. I’m terrified. I can’t figure it out. I’ve tried to. I’ve been to the toilet and my stool has been fine for the last few days. I’m eating scarcely, but when I am able to I’m not bringing it back up. I felt semi ok this morning - still not good to be honest - until that coffee sip. We were at the store and bought groceries and then went to get that coffee, I was supposed to go to the pet shop after but I told my boyfriend we needed to get home, fast. I’ve binned the rest of the coffee and now I’m just shaking and begging not to be sick essentially. I’ve been doing this for days now, but again it feels like it’s coming any minute this time and I just don’t really know what to do. It feels a lot worse this time again, my stomach really, really hurts. My boyfriend and me had take away last night but had the same food and he’s totally fine. I can’t believe that it’s just anxiety; because I feel like I really need to throw up. But it’s been about 3 days feeling like this consistently, albeit it’s a lot worse right now and I actually think I might v*, and I haven’t up until now. It’s confusing that my stool is entirely ok, too. I’d think if something was wrong with my stomach, it would be showing somehow by now. I was also fine on holiday. On the last day when we were coming home I had a SEVERE day leading panic attack, the airport, the flight, the whole way home and at home. We got back early hours of Wednesday morning. 

I’m on the toilet right now and everything is totally normal, but I feel like I’m getting really hot and like I need to v* and I’m just really defeated and upset. I have no idea what’s wrong with me and I don’t wanna v* lol. I’m also CONSTANTLY passing gas at both ends and my stomach is making noises every now and then. I’m so confused with the feeling like I really really really need the toilet and going and only going normally and also feeling like I’m gonna v*  any minute. 

My boyfriend is really good with my phobia - sure he gets fed up, but he’s always there. He said my head feels fine and he’s 100% certain I’m fine, and that I need to fix my diet, but I don’t know, I can’t shake this with my stomach. Something feels wrong, but other than feeling like I’m gonna v* any second I’ve not had any other signs. However, I think I might v* today and soon based on that sensation after drinking the coffee, now I’m feeling really, really bad and hyperventilating. I just burped and all I can taste is sick, so I really think I’m gonna be any minute . That smell and taste has just sent me completely. I can’t stop burping and tasting sick and I’m not hungry, my stomach is killing me.

The US hasn't really had anything to truly unite it since 9/11 and even that didn't last very long. The collective memory is exceptionally short. We don't have anyone to really go to war with and people have become complacent in their struggle. The majority of the population didn't vote, people complain about poor wages and food quality but don't take action to correct it, town halls are filled with the geriactric and the bored. So what do you do? You piss people off. Trump is systemically going through each group of people and giving them a reason to be angry. First it was DEI, then farmers, bailouts for other countries, now people are going to literally starve. I know that's a cursory list but it's what I can think of first thing in the morning. More and more people are becoming discontent to the point of action. He literally tore down a historic building for a gaudy display of wealth (and probably a secret bunker). Boom. History nerds angry. So when no one is united and you've got class war bubbling at the gates, you piss everyone off and people eventually find common ground. Who knows if it will result in actual violence from people rising up or if the people will be able to resolve this peacefully. I dunno. It's just a thought.

[The fleet assembles in Le Havre](https://preview.redd.it/ibzdruiw6rvf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0751dd32cdd88e8f022fdfef8598ee154908b68)

Formerly the Transat Jacques Vabres, it is a double-handed race along the historic coffee trading route from Le Havre in France to Martinique in the Caribbean — about 3,800 miles.

The race starts Sunday, Oct. 26 at 2:00 p.m. local time (GMT+1), and will likely take about two weeks to complete, depending on weather.

There are four classes of boats in this year’s edition, each with a different route aimed at ensuring the slowest arrive around the same time as the fastest:

**Ultim** \- Four entries

The fastest offshore racing yachts on the planet, these 100-foot trimarans can sail around the world in around 40 days and cross the Atlantic in under a week. Unlike all other boats in the race, the Ultims fly on foils and t-rudders, allowing them to sustain speeds in the range of 35+ knots. 

The favourites here are likely Banque Populaire XI, skippered by Vendee Globe 2016 winner Armel Le Cléac’h, and SVR Lazartique, the boat built for Vendée champion Francois Gabart and now skippered by Tom Laperche with ocean racing legend Franck Cammas as co-skippper.

**Imoca** \- 18 entries

The Vendée Globe boats need little introduction here. This will be Francesca Clapccich’s first race as skipper of ex-Malizia, now 11th Hour Racing, as well as the first major race for Armel Tripon aboard his new boat, a sistership to Malizia called Les P'Tits Doudous. 

In the daggerboard fleet, Nicolas D’Estais is making his debut as skipper of Café Joyeux, which won the Vendée Globe as Macif in 2012. Notably, Conrad Colman’s co-skipper is a trail runner who only just learned how to sail. 

Sam Goodchild is the likely favourite as he takes over Macif from Charlie Dalin, but Yoann Richomme on Paprec-Arkea is always near the front, and Elodie Bonafous will be completing her first major offshore race in Association Petits Princes, a sistership to Macif.

**Ocean Fifty**  \- 10 entries

These fifty-foot foiling — but not flying — trimarans are probably the least well known class of French racing yachts, which compete in a mix of inshore and offshore regattas. Interestingly, they take guests onboard during some races.

There will be some familiar names in this class, with Damien Seguin on Solidaires en Peoloton and Tanguy La Turquais aboard Lazare. Elodie-Jane Mettraux sailing as part of an all-female crew on Upwind by Merconcept is the sister of Justine Mettraux, who is sailing her own Imoca in the race. 

**Class40** \- 42 entries

A key stepping stone toward larger offshore racing yachts like the Imocas, Class40 are 40-foot non-foilers crewed mostly by up-and-coming sailors, a mixture of amateurs and professionals. Notably, two Vendée Globe champions, Vincent Rioux and Michel Desjoyeux will be aboard Class40 yachts in this edition.

My husband and I keep fighting lately(3 years into marriage), and I honestly don’t know if this marriage is still worth saving. I’d really appreciate some advice, especially from married men or women anyone who’s gone through something similar.

Context:
My husband has been going out almost every night. Basketball, running then coffee with friends after, sometimes pickleball. He doesn’t drink or cheat (I’m sure about that; he even sends videos to show where he is and i can locate thru find my). But it’s happening so often that I feel like he doesn’t prioritize us anymore.

We have one daughter, and it hurts every time she asks, “When is Daddy coming home?” When he does come home, he’s tired, quiet, and uninterested. It feels like we’re getting what’s left of him, not his best.

He used to be very sweet and thoughtful. He’d plan dates, spend time with me, but after we both went through some personal and financial struggles, everything changed. Sometimes I wonder if he’s acting this way because of financial pressure, like he’s distancing himself because he feels inadequate or overwhelmed? Im not sure 

Additional context:
I’ll admit, I’ve said hurtful things out of frustration. I’ve told him things like, “You’re financially irresponsible,” or “Why do you prioritize nonsense things when we need help with bills?” I know it’s not nice, but I’m so exhausted. I feel like I’m the one carrying the family financially, while he seems to escape reality through his friends.

We’re not on the same page anymore. He feels immature when it comes to priorities and responsibilities. Even our intimacy has changed, I’m always the one initiating, and it’s starting to hurt my self-esteem.

Previous Attempts:
I’ve tried to talk to him calmly, to express how we arent on the same page and that we really need to be serious already about life and not be irresponsible. But he either gets defensive or says I’m overreacting. Then nothing changes.

What I Need Advice On:
	•	For married men: When you’re stressed or struggling financially, do you tend to pull away from your wife and spend more time with friends instead?
	•	For anyone in a long-term relationship: How do you rebuild connection and respect after both of you have said hurtful things?
	•	Should I still fight for this relationship, or is it time to let go?

As the first rays of sunlight dance across the asphalt, I still feel the void where you used to be.  Maybe not you.  The hope.  The mercy.  The joy.  It's an odd phenomenon,  really.

When we were together, nothing was different,  yet everything wasn't as it seemed.  The sun was just a bit warmer.  Coffee just a hair fresher.  Things were just a shade more beautiful, laughter was just a touch more authentic, the world as a whole was just a beat better.  And it's gone now.  

It's not a barren wasteland that I first envisioned.  Not a sepia toned hellscape of torture and lament.  It is duller, though.  It post it's vibrancy.  And I've adapted to the new reality.  Accepted things I had hoped not be true.  The truth is, under the anger and frustration, self loathing and pain, there was love.  There ...is ...love.  Not limerence which would explain it all away, not the lust of a passing fancy, not intrigue of the mystery of the universe.   I love you for you.

1ofr3zm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ofr3zm/neverending_story/,Neverending Story,"I have a selfish sadness.  A yearn.  A desire.  A craving.  A need.  As the first rays of sunlight dance across the asphalt, I still feel the void where you used to be.  Maybe not you.  The hope.  The mercy.  The joy.  It's an odd phenomenon,  really.

When we were together, nothing was different,  yet everything wasn't as it seemed.  The sun was just a bit warmer.  Coffee just a hair fresher.  Things were just a shade more beautiful, laughter was just a touch more authentic, the world as a whole was just a beat better.  And it's gone now.  

It's not a barren wasteland that I first envisioned.  Not a sepia toned hellscape of torture and lament.  It is duller, though.  It post it's vibrancy.  And I've adapted to the new reality.  Accepted things I had hoped not be true.  The truth is, under the anger and frustration, self loathing and pain, there was love.  There ...is ...love.  Not limerence which would explain it all away, not the lust of a passing fancy, not intrigue of the mystery of the universe.   I love you for you.

Every intersection is like a starter pistol for some smoothbrain to rev up their personal cancer cannon. Cyclists and pedestrians just get to marinate in it. Delicious.

And for what? So people can haul two tons of steel to pick up a coffee. When you actually zoom out and look at it, it’s the dumbest system imaginable. Cities buried under parking lots, noise, fumes, and death traps.

Cars make up such a disgusting percentage of what you have to look at when walking or cycling through what could be a beautiful, green, human-centered city.

Sometimes I imagine people in the future looking back at this era, absolutely baffled by how we tolerated this car hellscape for so long. How we just accepted breathing poison as normal. But then I remember: most people don’t care. Not about health, not about the environment, not even about their own future, if it means a slight inconvenience to their daily comforto.

1ofqx56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ofqx56/aita_for_leaving_our_family_dinner_after_my/,AITA for leaving our family dinner after my grandpa made an inappropriate comment about me?,"I(18F) and my family(sister, her boyfriend, my mom and her girlfriend) always have dinner at my grandparents' house every weekend. This is normal for us because we're typically a close-nit family. I have always been sort of the ""black sheep"" of the family. Not that they treat my unfairly or anything, but I'm just not that close to them. I'm also more liberal than the rest of my family so my opinion on anything is irrelevant. 

For context, because my grandparents are super conservative, my grandfather thinks that he is entitled to everything i.e. first to get food, can touch anything or anyone, speak out of place, etc. I am also a person that does NOT do good with physical touch. I absolutely hate it when people touch me when I don't expect it. 

Anyways, we were sitting outside waiting for the food to be finished cooking. I was setting the table while my sister and her boyfriend were finishing up in the kitchen. When I finished I made myself tea and sat outside with my mom and her girlfriend. I do not drink a lot of alcohol, I prefer to drink tea or coffee  and my family kind of mock me for not drinking any alcohol. My grandfather was already a little drunk, and was saying something about how good I looked that night? He is a very outspoken person so he says stuff that typically won't fly when said in public, especially when he is intoxicated. I was wearing a tanktop(it's summer and 27°C at night) and a white short. He was commenting on how I looked and said something like, ""I'm so glad my granddaughter is such a sexy woman."" That comment made me VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. 

After that he grabbed my shoulder and gripped it so hard that it started hurting me. I stood up and went to the kitchen where my sister was. I told her what our grandfather said and that it made me uncomfortable. She just shrugged and said that's how he is. I told her that I didn't like it and I was on the verge of crying. She just told me it's not that bad and not to make a scene. I went to a spare room to calm myself down for a little bit, and then I came back when dinner was ready. We started eating and my grandpa kept trying to ask me why I went to another room and why I didn't want to sit next to him (my plate was set next to his so I just moved it across the table next to my sister's boyfriend, and excused it as me just wanting to sit closer to the fire). I didn't really answer him and then my mom and my sister yelled at me for ignoring him and that he was asking me a question. I was on the verge of tears and excused myself from the table. I grabber my stuff and drove back home. 

Later that night when my sister and mom came home, they berated me for causing a scene and being dramatic. I argued back and told them that I was not comfortable staying there. They insist that I should apologise to my grandfather, I feel like I had a right to leave after the comment he made. AITA for leaving?",10,1761397160.0,AITAH,21,0.81,False

The ones who aren’t a part of the puzzle?

Some days, I dream of achieving every material thing.
Other days, I wish to have nothing — and for nothing to own me.

I live in a different city, away from my parents.
I miss them every day.
I miss my little sister.

I hate opening that locked door of my room,
only to stare into emptiness.

I love to act.
But isn’t my whole life an act — pretending everything’s alright?

I used to love praying to God.
Now, when I look at the sky, it feels empty.
Maybe He’s left me.
Maybe, when I drink my silly cup of coffee,
He eats my heart like a pomegranate.

Everything is shaking.
I don’t have a clue.
I want to have a happy life, a purpose —
and then I realize: life and purpose are the most useless things.
Purpose is a manmade illusion.

I’m questioning my existence.
Questioning God’s existence.
Missing my mom and dad.

I hate that I have to talk to my ceiling fan.

When I’m sleepy, I don’t want to sleep —
because I know tomorrow will be the same.
Same work. Same people. Same silence.

I’ve mastered the art of laughing,
of making jokes.

But I really wish no one asks me how I’m doing —
because if I tell the truth,
I’ll have a breakdown.

I don’t want to tell anyone how I feel —
not because I’m shy,
but because if they leave,
I’ll have no one left to tell.

So, I look into the mirror and think:
maybe I just need the person standing in the mirror",2,1761396792.0,OffMyChestIndia,2,1.0,False

Decided to post the last episode of this FF a little earlier. This episode will be focused on Season 2’s last episode and also something like an epilogue like what happened after Tyler went with Capri.

Isaac tells Tyler to bring Pugsley near the place where Isaac was buried when he first 'died'.

Isaac: I am going to settle some things first. Tyler! You look out for Pugsley. I will be back soon! Then we will go together.

Tyler nods and Isaac goes. 

Tyler: Finish your meal before Isaac is back!

Pugsley: Cmon man! I admired you and Slurp. 

Tyler: Looks like the Addams are obsessed with the Galphin/Night family! And what kind of name is Slurp?!

Pugsley: Slurp, I mean Isaac when I resurrected him I Eugene and we fed him and he threw up. So we named him Slurp!

Tyler: Oh so that hummer is your friend, huh?!

Pugsley: I thought he was. But he just wanted to be roommates. Wednesday is so lucky she has many friends which she didn't want and I wanted friends but I have none.

Tyler: Your sister has it in her to attract attention.

Pugsley: Tyler, right? Please let me go! I am your big fan. It's so cool you can transform into a Hyde.

Tyler: You think I will let you go because of your buttering. Forget about your meal I am going to shut your mouth.

Tyler is about to take the plate,

Pugsley: No!

Pugsley takes it and he starts eating the food scared.

He finishes eating. Tyler is about to cover his mouth with the handkerchief,

Pugsley: You sure you want to do it? Wednesday will be mad!

Tyler ignores it and ties his mouth with the handkerchief. Isaac comes there.

Isaac: It's time let's go!

Tyler brings Pugsley by pulling the chain tied to his neck.

The three of them walk to the place where Isaac was buried.

Tyler: I can sense Wednesday around here!

Isaac: You will grab Thing, while I talk to Wednesday.

Tyler goes and he hides behind.


Wednesday walks to Isaac.

Isaac: Tyler warned me you were formidable. And now I witnessed the havoc you can wreck.

Tyler looks at Thing trying to aim at Isaac.

Wednesday: Give me back my brother, crawl back and stay dead this time. I know what you did to my father.

Tyler goes behind Thing and prepares to grab him.

Isaac: Yet I am the one who died! Thanks to your father and your dear mother. Let your brother pay for it and we call it even?

Wednesday: You do not have the machine. Willow Hill and Iago Tower are both destroyed. It will take months to rebuild it. By the time you do it, it will be too late to save your sister!

Thing shoots at Isaac and he shows his hand and catches it.

Isaac: I applaud the effort. While you kept me talking your faithful right hand takes his shot!

Tyler quickly grabs Thing and keeps him in a glass box. He locks it.

Tyler: Gotcha!

Tyler comes and passes the box to Isaac.

Issac: Except he has never been yours! He has been mine. Turns out your parents didn't kill all of me that night. 

Isaac opens his right-hand glove and sands fall out as he shows his amputated arm missing a hand. Thing gets scared.

Wednesday realized the missing hand of Isaac was Thing. Pugsley was shocked by the revelation.

Wednesday: Cute.

Isaac goes and looks at Thing.

Isaac: Imagine my surprise when I see my right hand wandering in the halls of Willow Hill without me. And a Da Vinci is nothing without his right hand. The power surge must have somehow animated my hand.

Wednesday: In your case, the part is greater than the whole.

Isaac quickly opens the box to grab Thing and Wednesday walks to him. Tyler stops her by holding her neck.

Isaac took Thing and used his powers to stitch Thing back to his right arm. Wednesday looked shocked and in disbelief.

Isaac: (looking at Thing) Now I am complete.

Wednesday get rid of Tyler's hold and go to Isaac and Isaac immediately uses his regained powers and makes Wednesday float in the air.

Isaac: The Addams family... ends tonight! 

Isaac controls Wednesday to be placed in the spot he prepared for her to be buried.

Isaac: Starting with you...

Wednesday is falling down.

Tyler and Wednesday look at each other.



As she falls on the ground, she can feel and see the roots capturing her and tying her down. The soil started burying Wednesday alive.



Tyler looked disheartened and shocked. It was actually happening. Isaac was really burying Wednesday alive! He recalls when they first met, their moments together, how she nursed his wounds and their first kiss. He clenched his jaws. He felt so helpless and felt his throat was dry.



He looked helpless.

Isaac: We have an appointment at Iago Tower!

Isaac holds Pugsley.

Isaac: Your pathetic little life will finally have a purpose.

Isaac and Tyler walked near Iago Tower and Tyler for the first time looked distracted.

Francoise was waiting for them.

Isaac happily shows his right hand/Thing and Francoise screams in happiness and hugs him. She looks at Thing like it was a baby and rests her head on Isaac's shoulder.

Francoise: Now we can finally fix our family. Hello!

Tyler was speechless and was in no mood to celebrate like them. He doesn't understand the equation between his mom and uncle. Pugsley looked confused and worried.

They go to the Iago Tower.

Francoise: Cmon!

Tyler pulls Pugsley and takes him.

They are in Iago Tower. Tyler makes Pugsley sit in the chair for the electric supply like Isaac told him to.

Isaac looked at the machine.

Isaac: I have been waiting for this moment for 30 years!

Tyler locked Pugsley's hands and legs and he looked at Francoise while doing so. Pugsley uses his electric power to give Tyler a minor shock. He looks at Pugsley angrily as he hates it and Pugsley smiles.

Tyler: Get ready. We are about to fry your battery.

Tyler secured Pugsley's helmet as without that they can't get electricity.

As Tyler was done and he looked, Isaac used his powers and let Tyler float in the air the same way as Wednesday some time back.

He then puts him down on the stretcher meant for Francoise and ties his hands and legs down. Tyler was shocked as he didn't see that coming.

Tyler: (panic) Wait! What are you doing?! Mom...we are here to save you!



Francoise: (carressing his hair) It's too late for me, sweetie. This is your time now. We can save you from this life!

Tyler nods no. This wasn't meant for him.

Francoise: To give you a fresh start!

Tyler: No, no! You have no right to take my powers from me!



He was breathing heavily.

Francoise: Shhh

She kissed her finger and placed it on his cheek.

Francoise: Love you.

Francoise smiles.

Tyler: Don't do this! I beg you, please!

Francoise: I love you, baby.

Isaac goes to start the experiment!

Tyler: Mom!!! Mom please.... Mom!!!

Francoise can sense presence.

Francoise: (worried) We have company. 

Tyler: Please don't do this!!!

Isaac starts the experiment.

The electricity generated from Pugsley starts to be transferred into Tyler's body to ruin his Hyde abilities. Both Tyler and Pugsley were in too much pain due to this.

Isaac and Francoise were trying to track who was present but they couldn't find anyone.

Tyler was shouting as it was too much for him to take. His mom's betrayal and losing his power and....Wednesday...

Just then he sees Wednesday coming towards him with an axe. She managed to survive again thankfully. 

Tyler understood now he would either be a normie or lose his life. He chose the latter and being killed by Wednesday could not have been better for him.

He looked at Wednesday giving up hope of living.

Tyler: Kill me...



Wednesday took the axe angrily aiming at his vitals and Tyler closed his eyes before dying.



Wednesday hits but she doesn't?! She uses the axe to untie one of his hands instead! Tyler was confused.

Tyler: Why?!



Wednesday: I missed.



He looked at her surprised as he knew she never missed! Why did she do this?!

Tyler was unlocked now and he got really angry with how his mother and uncle fooled him. He Hyded out by his own. Wednesday quickly went to save Pugsley.

The Hyde looked at Isaac angrily, grabbed him and threw him downstairs as he fell unconscious!

The Hyde jumped down and looked at Francoise angrily. She looks at him scared.

Francoise: It's okay... It's your mommy!

The Hyde looked at her angrily.

Francoise: Tyler? Honey! Baby...

The Hyde grabbed Francoise and threw her away and roared.

He then sees his mom turning into a  female Hyde. She looked at him angrily.

They both fought each other as if they were not mother and son but enemies. Both angry at each other, they held and threw off one another. They attacked each other violently.

The Hyde roared at the female Hyde and then she threw him out of the window as he fell and then she broke the glass.

The female Hyde bit on his neck as it bled. He punches her but she got the better hold and attacks his face multiple times.



The Hyde tries to climb up to save himself and the female Hyde follows him angrily. She catches up to him and just then there is a blast in Iago Tower!

This lets both the Hydes fall down. The male Hyde grabs hold well and prevents himself from falling but the female Hyde is struggling to come up.

He forwards his hand to his mom. He wants to pull her out and save her. His mom looks at him and then she lets go of herself shocking him.

Hyde: Nooo!!!!



And she falls right on the arm of a stoned werewolf statue marking her demise. The scary eyes of Hyde turned into pain and sorrow.

The Hyde went right up and saw. She was really gone. It was the very scene from Xavier's prenomination drawing he feared and thought was the end of his life at the hands of a werewolf. 

The Hyde in that drawing was not him but his mom. The werewolf in that drawing was not Enid but a statue.

It was worse than his own death. He roared in anger and pain for his mom. He lost her! Again...

The next day,
Tyler looked at the gravestone of his parents. The fact that the last moment he had with them wasn't on good terms with both his parents. He tried to attack them both the last time they met. No one else will have to face this. He wasn't going to live for long anyway. He might be back with his parents soon.



Just then Tyler hears a voice.

Voice: Hello, Tyler!

Tyler: Whoever you are, just walk away.

Voice: We both know you can't survive out here alone. Not for long. I can save you!



He knew it was another lady older than him.

Tyler: Yeah I am done with mothers and masters!

The lady was curly-haired, a werewolf.

Lady: I am not interested in being either! I am offering a support system for people like you. Fellow Hydes, hidden away where the world can't find them.

Hidden from the world, what he always wanted. But right now, he could deal with things alone. He didn't want any interaction.

As he was about to leave,

Lady: You will be part of a pack, creating a bond that transcends the need of a single master.

Tyler: What's in it for you? You are a werewolf. I can smell it from here!

Lady: My father was a Hyde.

Tyler saw some hope in her words.

Later,
The lady drove the car and Tyler looked at her with hope.



Tyler: May I know how do I address you?

Lady: Capri.

Tyler: Thanks for taking me away from Jericho, Capri...Like I always wanted.

Capri: You will love it there.

Tyler did not raise his hopes what mattered to him was that he would finally be away from the wretched town of Jericho.

Tyler closed his eyes to take a nap in peace as he could hear the horns of the cars.

Time Skip,
Tyler opens his eyes as he is lying on a bed. He got up and he walked out of the window and looked at nature.

Capri: Tyler?

Tyler looks behind and finds Capri bringing him pancakes.

Capri: I got you pancakes for your anniversary in the community.

Tyler: You can keep it on the table.

Tyler sits down and eats his breakfast.

Capri: Can I join you for breakfast?

Tyler nods.

Tyler is eating and then Capri asks him a question looking concerned.

Capri: Tyler... you should really communicate more. I think you should consider joining the Hyde pack. It's been a while since you were here, but you barely speak to anyone except for one.

Tyler: Community and pack these are not for me, Capri. The only reason I came here is because I wanted to be away from Jericho and I am thankful to you for that.

Tyler starts coughing. Capri gets up and passes him a tissue. As he coughs there is a lot of blood.

Capri: See this is why I am telling you, Tyler. Your condition is worsening as days pass by. I know you do not want a master. You do not want to be controlled. This is why being in a pack is the only option you have, to survive!

Tyler: Being in a pack you have to agree with others. I am terrible at teamwork. This isn't me. And I don't see the problem if I am not living for long. I am getting freedom till my last days, that's enough for me. And you would have one burden less once I am gone.

Capri: Tyler, none of you is a burden to me. I like helping you guys! 

Tyler: If you like helping, I would appreciate it if you would leave me alone.

Capri: Tyler...

Tyler: Capri, please?!

Capri leaves.

Tyler finishes eating and then he opens the drawer and takes out the book. It was the same book where Isaac wrote his findings about outcasts.

Tyler: And this very book is going to be my checkmate to get what I want!

Tyler smirks.

Tyler wears his jacket and goes to a cafe. As he is reading the book of Isaac's, he finds Fester and Thing there. He smiles and goes to approach him.

Tyler sits in front of Fester and drinks his coffee.

Fester: Hey that's not very nice! My niece paid for it!

Fester finally recognises him.

Fester: You are that Hyde kid! Thing we spoke of your devil nephew and here he is!

Thing gestures that he has no idea.

Tyler:  You are going to help me!

Fester: Why would I?

Tyler: You have no other choice.

Fester uses his electricity power to shock Tyler. It stopped him and he looked annoyed.

Tyler: I tried the nice way and now I am done!

Tyler takes a handkerchief and gets Fester unconscious. Thing tries to intervene, Tyler grabs him tightly and locks his fingers with chains.

Later,
Tyler is an isolated place and Fester opens his eyes and finds himself chained to a chair.

Fester: You will regret it, kid!

Tyler: Now you will cooperate with me. You won't want to create problems for Wednesday!

Fester: I will make you cry, kid!

Tyler ignores him.

Tyler is preparing something while looking at Isaac's book and then another boy comes there.

Guy: Tyler should I bring her now?

Tyler nods.

Later,
Wednesday reaches there in a hurry with Agnes and they hear Uncle Fester's screams and the roars of a Hyde and the barks of werewolves.

Wednesday: Agnes you stay here, this is for your safety.

Agnes: I can't let you go in alone, Wednesday!

Wednesday: I have to save Uncle Fester and Thing! They weren't supposed to be here. I dragged them here because I was looking for Enid!

Wednesday reaches here and he finds broken machines, some blood and she finds Uncle Fester chained.

Wednesday quickly unlocks him.

Wednesday: You okay?

Fester: I am feeling dizzy!

Wednesday: What the hell happened here?

Just then she looks around and she finds Tyler walking slowly and struggling. Thing goes back to Fester, helping him.

Wednesday: Tyler what have you done to my Uncle Fester?!

Tyler: So you again managed to make it here, huh?! But this time you are a bit too late...

Wednesday: Tyler, you have made a huge mistake! How could you destroy my uncle's powers?!

Tyler: Wednesday...

Wednesday: I should not have missed that day!

Tyler: Then why did you?!

Wednesday: We both know the answer to that. But this time I won't.

Wednesday takes a knife and stabs Tyler. He looks at her teary-eyed but smiling.

Just then she hears a voice

Voice: Wednesday!

Wednesday looks up and finds Enid, in her human form.



Wednesday: (relieved) Enid, you are okay?! And you are back to your human form?

Enid: It was Tyler. He saved my life.

Wednesday looked at Tyler shocked as he fell down and she quickly held him. He was semi-conscious.

Wednesday: Why would he save you?!

Enid: I don't know! All I know if I am back to my human form it is all because of Tyler. He and his Hyde friend protected me when the other werewolves tried to attack me.

Uncle Fester tries to see if his power is still there and he sees some sparks. Wednesday looks at Tyler shocked!

Wednesday: Tyler... how did you do this?

Tyler: Isaac's book. He had remedies for all outcasts...

Tyler is coughing and blood is coming out of his mouth. Wednesday isn't able to see him like this.

Guy: That book had a solution for an Alpha werewolf who transformed into an Alpha during a full moon to restore their human abilities. For that, the blood of an Alpha werewolf which we got from Capri, A Da Vinci's touch and sparks electricity to power up the machine were needed. It won't harm any outcasts just temporary pain, I helped Tyler with this as he wanted to help you by helping Enid regain her human abilities.

Wednesday: No! I don't believe this! Tyler Galphin will never want to help me, he always wanted me dead! You are lying! And how would he know Enid had permanently transformed?

Agnes: I might have told him. 

Agnes appears. 

Tyler looks at Agnes and nods no. He is coughing more and closing his eyes in pain. Wednesday takes her handkerchief to cover his wound.

Wednesday: (strictly) Tell me everything you know, Agnes!

Agnes gets into a flashback,

Agnes appears as Tyler is grieving for his parents' demise while looking at their gravestones. He just silently buried his mother overnight. 

Agnes: I am sorry for your loss.

Tyler: Don't be if you are not.

Agnes puts her head down.

Agnes: I know we were on different sides for some time, but when we talked in the hospital, since then I've seen you as a big brother. I still do...

Tyler: You were right about me in Willow Hill, the other day. I am a Hyde before anything else. Now because of that I am left all alone... I do not regret being a Hyde. I do not regret losing the chance of being a normie because I never wanted to be one. That wasn't the real me....

Agnes: Tyler, there is still time. Things can be fixed. You still have goodness in you. If it wasn't for you, Wednesday might not have survived.

Agnes: While I was on my way back to my home, I got your message... You told me to save Wednesday and shared the location. You didn't say anything else.
If not I won't have made it on time to unbury her with Enid who unfortunately turned into a werewolf permanently while saving Wednesday.



Tyler felt bad for Enid.

Tyler: The real saviour was Enid. I did nothing while I saw Wednesday being buried. 

Agnes: Your Hyde senses detected me I know that. You looked at me and you knew I was there and you didn't intervene so that Isaac couldn't harm me and Wednesday in a worse way. Why don't you talk to Wednesday one more time? I mean she saved your life too.

Tyler: That is the answer I have been hunting. Whatever it is, it doesn't matter. Situation and circumstances proved we are not meant to be together. Our families have a dark history and so do we.

Agnes: I hope you do talk to her for once. You won't get the chance again. She is leaving Jericho and won't be back since Nevermore is never more.

Tyler: Good. No one should be here. Moreover, it is her betterment I don't approach her. You can leave now, Agnes. Take care of yourself.

Agnes leaves and she looks at Tyler sadly. 

Agnes gets out of a flashback.

Agnes: (teary-eyed) I should have told you about this earlier!

Tyler is breathing heavily. 

Wednesday: No, Tyler you are not dying on me!

Capri: Wednesday, we need to take him for immediate medical attention.

Tyler: Leave it, it's too late for me...I was going to die soon anyway! Better I am dying from Wednesday's hand.

Wednesday: No! It's not! I am sorry for stabbing you...

Tyler: Wednesday Addams is saying sorry to me. That itself is a victory for me too! 

Wednesday: Shut up!

Tyler: Wednesday... I don't know if you will trust me now, but I wanted you to know whatever happened in Weathervane was genuine from my side.

Tyler: Like I said I did terrible things, but I am not a terrible person!

Tears drop from Wednesday's eyes hearing this. He never imagined he would see her crying for him. Enid also feels really bad for them and she cries too.

Tyler's eyes slowly shut but before he shuts his eyes for once and all, he sees a figure attacking Wednesday from behind. She fell unconscious beside him as Tyler tried to scream No!

Tyler opens his eyes slowly. And he can hear the melody of the cello.

He walked slowly and he found a girl in a black dress playing the cello hard. The melody reminds him of Wednesday.

Tyler: Uh...

The girl looks behind and it's Wednesday with her same no-emotional stare.



Wednesday: Oh Tyler so you have opened your eyes finally...

Tyler was wondering whether he was in Hell or Heaven but whatever it was, he loved it.

Wednesday: You were down for some time. Welcome back!

Tyler: Uhh how are we here?! 

Wednesday: Long story. Now it's not the time. 

Tyler: Didn't know you played the cello....

Wednesday: I thought you stalked me. How did you miss out this part?

Tyler: Maybe some things are meant to be found out the more I know you. 

Wednesday finishes playing the cello. And she gets up.

Wednesday: You should go and rest. Or maybe do what you like...apart from Hyding out as you are still weak.

Wednesday goes avoiding eye contact with him, Tyler holds her hand and she looks at him. She isn't fond of physical contact. 

Tyler: You asked me to do what I like!


Tyler pulls Wednesday close to her and starts kissing her. She also reprociates. It went on for some time and they laid on the bed.

Wednesday: You were right. We are two black heart souls ready to pillage the world together!

Tyler gives his evil get very much in love with Wednesday smile. 

Tyler: Yes we are! Honestly can't believe we just had our second kiss!

Wednesday: Who said it was our second kiss?! Forgot about our second kiss?

Tyler looks at Wednesday confused.

The end.

Well I wasn't’ sure how to wrap up the story so decided to give an open ending kind. Not sure what’s gonna happen in S3, so this whole segment after Tyler left Jericho could have actually happened or be his dream while he took a nap, I leave that up to you to assume the ending you want 😅.

I was half OK because I had a long nap the day before, but I felt bad for him as he wasn't feeling well after having near to no sleep. In the morning I decided to take him for a long drive so he could nap in the car. I made a big travel mug of coffee and set off.

I was driving about 40 mph in a 50 mph zone to keep things smooth with no harsh turns, no potholes, nothing that might wake him. After a while, a car came up behind me and started tailgating. I figured it would be fine since the road was about to split into two lanes at the lights.

When we stopped, the guy pulled up next to me, clearly angry. Then he noticed my son asleep and started honking nonstop and screaming at me, deliberately waking him up. My poor boy immediately started crying. The driver laughed and kept honking.

I completely lost it and I couldn't belive people being so mean. I rolled my window down and threw my cup of coffee through his open window. It was cold by then, but still it was almost a full mug. Because it wa green by then, then I drove off to find a place to stop to calm down my boy.  The guy went the other way thankfully. 

Now I feel awful. It was impulsive and not smart because the guy could have follow us. But I just couldn’t believe how cruel that man was. My son didn’t go back to sleep after that, and I’ve been feeling guilty all day.

I’ve been using specialty coffee beans ground with a Hibrew G5 for about a year now. Until a month ago, I always made moka coffee because I like its flavor.  
Since switching to espresso (De’Longhi Dedica with IMS filters), I just can’t find a taste I enjoy. I’ve tried many different combinations — changing the coffee dose, grind size, and extraction time — but no matter what I do, I can’t find a formula I like.

What I notice is that, even when the extraction seems fine, the flavor is always much stronger than moka and much more “aggressive” in the throat. It’s generally more acidic and full-bodied than moka, even when I go up to a 1:3.5 ratio.  
In short, I can’t find a taste that pleases me.

What also bothers me a bit is the quantity: if I use the single basket (8–13 g), it’s even harder to get a good result. From what I’ve read online, this seems normal given the conical shape of the single basket, which makes it tricky to work with such a small amount of coffee. So the best option seems to be the double basket — but for me, that’s really too much for one person, since it takes about 15–17 g.

I’ve also tried using 16 g in and 32 g out, adjusting the grind, but it’s just way too strong — undrinkable!  
Is it normal for espresso to be this intense? Does this mean espresso just isn’t for me, or am I doing something wrong?

So me and my bf went to this coffee shop sa Pampanga. The place is vibe, and really has a good quality of coffee drink selection. The staffs are also nice so it’s a plus. So ako, as a coffee lover talaga, I ordered the not so mainstream flavor for experience. Fast forward, dahil malamig na yung place, I started to feel uneasy na sa stomach ko. I also naubos na yung drink ko. 

So I went to cr which is nasa labas ng coffee shop. So ako go na sa cr. When I started to flush na the toilet, nag go through naman pero mahina kasi yung water pressure. So sa second attempt ko, gurl, ayaw nang mag flush. hahahaha. So ako nagpanic ng slight. I tried to use na the bidet which is mahina rin pressure niya. Then suddenly, may kumakatok na sa door, may gagamit na rin ng cr. So si bading, instant panic talaga. Hahahahaha. Imagine tried to use na rin the cr pump pero it made it worse. So helpless na talaga ako. I calmed myself and sabi ko I will face this nalang. So I closed the toilet cover nalang, to cover up my mess. Hahahahah. Tapos paglabas ko andun si ate girl at friend niya. Sabi ko agad “Sira po the toilet if gagamitin niyo.” Then umalis na ako. So pagbalik ko sa table namin ni jowa ko sabi ko alis na tayo kwento ko nalang paglabas natin. 

So we immediately went out. And surprisingly, right after we open the door, nakasalubong namin si ate gurl galing sa cr. Nag eye to eye kami and she’s like saying na “i know what you did gurl” HAHAHAAHAHHA. imagine the horror and kahihiyan na nafeel ko during that time. Tapos halos natatawa sila ng friend niya. So mas binilisan namin umalis tapos hanggang sa pagsakay sa jeep hiyang hiya ako. Imagine aesthetic gurly ako tapos yung jebs ko palutang lutang sa cr. HAHAHAAHAHAHAH. To ate gurl, sorry. I warned you naman na eh. I really feel sorry. Hahahahah. And to my defense, di ko naman kasalanan na sira or not functioning well yung toilet. Kaya lesson learned na wag kape. Lol. Hahahahha.

I faced massive logistical resistance (late-night, unfamiliar city, set refused her place). I adapted the plan in real time, escalating from a 30-min date to pulling her to my society's isolated basement parking. Executed my first-ever car lay (in a tiny Kwid) despite her being in a relationship.

The main lesson: adapting your lay plan is key.

The report 👇🏼

THE MEET:
Now finally, after 2-3 hilarious incidents, which if you guys want me to tell about, I can tell you guys, we finally met. I had parked my car outside her society's gate and strolled for 2-3 minutes before we met. When we met, we both had a strong smile; she was wearing a sexy top, which again gave me a strong signal that she unconsciously wants the lay to happen.

Now we sat in my car. I played my seductive playlist, which I play on dates, & ran my game. She was loving my presence. I couldn't get beer because by the time I reached her it was 10 already, and all the thekas were closed. I didn't know the venue where I met her well enough, so honestly I didn't know how and where to logistically escalate, but I had a vague plan.

My plan was to verbally and physically escalate in the car and the lead her to her place. But 5-10 minutes in of her loving my presence, she herself suggested to get coffee, honestly that idea didn't cross my mind because it was 10 and unconsciously I though every shop will be closed plus I also wanted to lead it to lay fast.

If the set suggests a logistical escalation that ADDS to the lay plan directly or indirectly then one must do it. We drove to the Spectrum Mall, as we were heading to the McD she suggested to get hot chocolate from Barista instead, I teased her saying ""we may have it only if we'll share aur tum mera juthe khane se addict nahi hogi ;)"" she loved it.

We gave the order, sat down across each other and I set the timer for 30 minutes. Now this traditional date is absolutely crucial but it should not be for more than 30 minutes because 30 minutes are more than enough to gauge her and build foundations for pulling. Which I did. She was loving my banter, laughing like a little girl and getting her eyes watery.

I realised I need to increase more of the seduction eneregy instead of the bantery one now and I started doing kino. She was receptive, easily giving me her hand, letting me play with her fingers, set her hair etc. I checked the timer and it was nearing 30 minutes, I lead her saying ""let's go"", I paid and we left.

As we were walking to my car, she got a cigarette and had it outside my car leaning on it's bonet beside me. I softly held her by her waist, moved her towards and we smoothly got our skins in contact strongly. I could feel she unconsciously wants the lay and I knew that now I must escalate on her neck when we go inside the car. She finsihed her cigarette, we got in my car, I vibed for 2-3 minutes.

Now I started escalating, set her hair, got her close to me, made her rest her head on my shoulder. Now I started licking her delicious and smooth shoulders softly, she was loving it, I increased intensity and licked, sucked and kissedd on more areas. She was getting turned on as I was getting near her neck and setting her hair. As I got the right aim, I went hard on her neck, licking, sucking and kissing it. Turning her on.

She loved it but pushed me away when I went for kiss. I pulled back for 1-2 minutes and continued again the same sequence but this time more intense, went for kiss again, got pushed away. Pulled back again for 1-2 minutes and went at it again and kissed her this time. She got super turned on, started sucking on my tongue, swalloing my saliva and what not. After 2-3 minutes, I pulled back. 

The road was getting a bit busy suddenly and I decided to find a spot. I usually run dates and pull in Delhi so I don't know much about Noida though I live here but I was trying my best. After 10-15 minutes of not being able to find a spot, I parked my car near her society's gate as at least that was bit isolated. Now we made out harder this time, earlier she was bit hesitant in public but now she was feeling safe.

And despite me feeling bit shy now in public she was all over me. Anyway I pulled back again and said that I need to use her washroom, she knew the trick, she literally pointed out a public washroom and said you can go there lol. I didn't know what to do now so I ran more game and more physical escalation turning her on super hard. But still she was super resistant on going to her place.

I tried hard leading by turning off the car, getting out, she got out too but still no. I realised her being turned on and still not letting me go to her place must be because of some serious reason. I live in Noida too so I told her that we're going to my society's basement 2 parking. She was bit hesitant, this was the only thing coming to my mind to actually lay. I'll fuck her in my tiny bitch ass car.

She said she's hungry, perfect moment to drive near to my society in name of finding a food shop. Along the way to the food shop, she kissed me out of nowhere, I kinda scolded her because its not safe while driving but that turned her on lowkey lol. Finally she got something to eat and I was still running my mind how the fuck am I gonna lay her.

But anyway I trust myself and process, I drove the car to my society's basement 2 which is isolated good enough. I found a spot, parked my car, though I should've reversed park. Now we made out the hardest, no one to see, in my car as seductive music was playing. I sucked on her tits, licked her wherever I could turning her super on, she was moaning. The car is small its Renault's Kwid so I couldn't escalate much.

We've never had sex in car, especially me because I've been mainly working on building the skillset of doing hotel pulls which I believe I've built good enough as of now. But pulling in car? I had no clue. Now I didn't know how to get her into the back seat to have sex. And then it simply clicked me to do the hard lead. I told her in a strong commanding way ""get in the backseat"" and I got out of the car for backseat.

She followed my command. Us both now in backseat and doing ever harder makeouts and what not. I had a firm grip on her and went straight into her panties. As I was slowly stimulating her pussy she was making it easy for me to get inside more to the point I was fingering her rough. As I was running my fingers I whispered in her ears ""you want it"", ""you want my dick inside you"" etc.

And after a short while she herself whispered ""fuck me"". I pulled down my pyjamas and she pulled down hers, I got her on top, fucked her in cowgirl rough. We both got exhausted pretty quick maybe because of the short space. We both clearly wanted more and as she was about to wear her pyjama back. I pulled her legs, got her on her back, spread her legs and went inside her smooth and fast.

Now I went all in, I gave 0 fucks of us getting caught and though because of small space I couldn't last long as my knees and shins were getting bruised but I made sure that those 15-20 minutes that I fuck her, I fuck the brains outta her. She was moaning like crazy. Anyway we both got exhausted as fuck and then we simply wore back our clothes.

I drove her back to her place ans she STILL didn't let me go to her place for us to fuck more. She was super sleepy and tired but she still didn't let me lead to her place and that made me strongly feel that there must've be something really serious that even after sex she isn't taking me. Anyway I dropped her, we made out one last time. I came back home and of course got scolded the shit outta me.

So used to at this point that I registered absolutely nothing lol anyway it was all worth it in the end. An important pieces of information though I live with my family so I couldn't pull her at my home, instead chose to do so in my car that too in my society's basement.

This is a primary reason as to why not only do I mostly game in Delhi, try to lay there but also worked on building the skillset of hotel pulling first. But anyway until then... onto... the... NEXT!

WHAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST:
That how effective can simply making a lay plan fast, no matter how clunky and uncertain it is can be. I had no clue about the venue but simply making the lay plan right on the spot and STICKING to it made this lay possible in my opinion despite one of the strongest factor in game not being in my favor i.e. logistics.

THINGS TO IMPROVE SECTION:
- Build a lay/pull plan for Noida. The city isn't that big plus it has too many isolated spots that can be leveraged using car.
- Build system for car pulls, integrate and leverage them from now on whenever possible.

TEXTING TO MEET:
Surprisingly, she wasn't as bitchy, holding her ""I am hot shit"" frame on texts, but that doesn't mean she was making it easy for me. She was still making it hard for me to meet. I have gone through this so much that it doesn't bother me, and I simply do my job, try to get sets out, and ping when they ghost me. I did the same with her, though she didn't ghost me, but she was passively making it hard for me to meet her.

It's normal, and I am used to it; it's often a test from sets to gauge us. Finally we agreed to meet yesterday at DLF Mall of India around 9 PM-ish. I suggested meeting around 7 PM-ish, but she suggested 9, saying that she leaves her office late and will come directly there.

Honestly, this was a green signal because if a set wants to meet you this late after a hectic office day, she most probably unconsciously wants the lay to happen. I took this green light as a strong window of opportunity, and I knew for sure that whatever happens tonight, I am not leaving without my dick inside her. Finally, after some back-and-forth communication on texts, we agreed that I'll bring beer near to her place and we'll have it in my car.

Plans changed so much because I got so busy doing daygame that I didn't see her texts; she got a bit pissed and went straight to her home from the office instead of coming to DLF.

THE INITIAL APPROACH:
Ironically, when I approached this set (let's call her A) at the HK station, I was heading to meet a set for D2 (let's call her T), whom just the day before I had made out with aggressively in public. I failed to bounce T to a venue where I could easily lead her to the pull venue, and just after that, I same-day laid a set (let's call her Y). 

And the day when I approached A and was headed to meet T for D2 after a same-day lay fail, I STILL failed to lay with her despite pulling her lol. Anyway, coming to the initial interaction with A, I saw her enjoying ice cream, standing peacefully in a corner. I got pulled to her energy because her energy seemed potent, intense, and sexual, something I unconsciously get attracted to.

She was wearing shorts making her thighs look delicious, her breasts really firm and her curves really tight. All this made me turned on, I knew am gonna approach her no matter what. HK station being HK was crowded, after 2-3 minutes I reached upto her, opened, she didn't got hooked enough. She was focused on her ice-cream.

She was holding her frame that I get hit on all the time, I am hot shit etc. and I held my frame, I kept running my game, now she was hooked, smiling but trying to hide the fact that she's enjoying my interaction. I realised she's into me but she's shy because she's trying hard to hold her frame plus she's not able to make and hold eye contact.

As told above I had to meet T and she said she's waiting to meet her BF and cousin. So after 2-3 minutes I cut the interaction short, closed her and left. Honestly this is a very common interaction for me at least so I wasn't expecting much from A and at that moment and days after that I was more mentally occupied with my same-day lay and D2 lay fails with T.",1,1761395761.0,datingadviceformen,1,1.0,False

1ofqd9i,https://tipstor.io/augmented-reality-is-turning-everyday-buyers-into-brand-believers/,Augmented Reality Is Turning Everyday Buyers Into Brand Believers,"The training packet is dead. The video module is yesterday’s coffee-stained relic. In travel and hospitality, where first impressions matter more than margins, brands are now turning to AR-Driven Customer Education powered by AI and lifecycle management. Augmented reality doesn’t just show a guest how to use the minibar. It immerses them in it, tracks every move, every hesitation, then adjusts the education flow based on what it learns.

The scale of the shift is staggering. Grand View Research reports the global augmented reality market size was estimated at USD 83.65 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a 37.9 percent compound annual growth rate from 2025 to 2030. According to ImagineAR trends data, in 2024 AR software alone held a market volume around USD 13.0 billion. The mathematics screams opportunity. When companies harness AR to educate customers or staff, they reduce misuse, minimize returns, and drive incremental revenue with fewer touchpoints.

AI and lifecycle management are the gears beneath the gloss. Avatar-guided AR tutorials feed data into platforms that monitor user behavior. Which features are skipped, how long a guest lingers over the room-service tablet, whether the minibar selection leads to an upsell or confusion. That data loops back. Adjust tutorial modules, refine messaging, and redefine offerings. Lifecycle frameworks integrate product usage, guest engagement, and retention metrics into one continuous feedback engine. According to PwC’s Future of Work study, 58 percent of hospitality brands are now investing in immersive training and education tech. That investment isn’t whimsy. It’s strategic maneuvre aimed at loyalty and margin.

Travel and hospitality aren’t just testing these waters. They’re staging full-scale operations. Marriott International piloted AR experiences in select properties where guests used phone-based AR to view room layouts, in-room features, and local services in 3D. Behavior analytics showed guests who used the AR tutorial ordered room-service packages at a rate 12 percent higher and cancelled fewer bookings than the average. Airlines are flying similar missions. Cabin crews train in AR simulations that mirror high-stress inflight incidents, then real performance sees fewer errors and faster response times.

The trend is bursting into view. One is micro-tutorials triggered in real time. If a guest opens the minibar, the AR prompt kicks in, showing recommended pairings and upsell options. Another is cross-channel AR education. Hotel apps sync with wearables, allowing late-arrive guests to run through room amenities via AR in the lobby before reaching the door. A third is personalization engines adjusting AR narratives based on sentiment detection. If an app detects the user is unfamiliar with a destination, the AR guide shifts into a “local insider” angle rather than standard orientation.

The competitive edge is unmistakable. Brands that deploy AR-driven education translate onboarding, upselling, and retention into measurable performance gains. They’re moving beyond feature lists and regulating experiences in ways that feel tailored, not templated. The companies that master the loop, where AR educates, AI measures, lifecycle systems optimize, won’t just lead in training, they will dominate in guest loyalty and ancillary income. In the realm of travel and hospitality, it’s not enough to have the best beach. You need guests who know it, appreciate it, and buy everything you offer while they’re there. AR-driven customer education is how they’ll get there, and how you’ll still be billing when others are still booking.

I changed from citalopram 40mg to sertraline on 26/9 after a period of voluntary tapering. This consultation had been scheduled for some time due to increasing anxiety, including health anxiety.

On 21/9 I had a serious fall in my back garden which required an A&E trip because my leg was swelling badly. Although nothing was broken the haematoma on my knee has led to me having to curtail my active lifestyle for some time. Before the fall I would go on 3/4 long walks a week. This fall made me extremely anxious, even more so when the bruising started. I became scared I was going to get a clot or something, and I started having the worst panic and anxiety attacks I've had in years. I have been on sertraline before and experienced no major side effects and as such thought it'd be a similar story this time round.

It wasn't.

The panic attacks increased to several times a day. I began feeling dizzy. I began having palpitations. The sweating- my God, the sweating. At the end of week 1 I felt slightly better, but then the dose increase brought everything back with a vengeance. I became scared to leave the house. I became scared to do anything strenuous in case my heart stopped or started beating out of my chest. I began ruminating. The dizziness got worse and I started being anxious about my blood pressure. Chest pain started. I was obsessively checking my pulse and had to turn off the heart rate monitoring on my Apple Watch in case it gave me an irregular heartbeat or high heart rate notification while out and about (at one point in week 3 I made a doctor's appointment about my clot worries and ended up having a near panic attack in the office that had me burning a lot of calories!). While I was making improvements with my leg, the symptoms made me concerned that something was wrong with my heart. I even became frightened that I was burning too many calories. I read that some people on SSRIs have a bad reaction to coffee and began somatising this (I normally begin to feel quite happy with coffee). At the end of week 3 I began developing brain fog, which doesn't scare me much as I know it to be a symptom of anxiety and one of the brain's ways of stopping me panicking.

Week 4 has been a turning point. I am no longer scared to leave the house despite having a cold and have been on several fairly decent walks. Last Saturday, Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday I even went out at night. Sunday was a bit of a setback though- after getting some bad news I started having a palpitation, but I managed to go out and not die (even though I was depressed for the rest of the night). By Wednesday I was feeling much more like my old self, with only a bit of dizziness which I know now probably has nothing to do with blood pressure as it's such a common symptom of going on sertraline. Thursday though I had some episodes of panic, again going back to the fear that I was being too active, plus being on a full tram I wasn't expecting to be such. I am no longer obsessively checking my pulse. Friday I had a decent walk with a nice coffee, but as soon as I sat down and had my dinner I began feeling lightheaded (not dizzy). I watched a football match on TV and had to quit just after half time because I was getting so anxious. Today I had another walk and started feeling dizzy, a symptom that didn't stop once I sat down. But I feel as though I have my energy and will back.

I have also been feeling more anxious in the morning. My heart starts racing and it scares me. I notice things in my body more. While I am making progress I am concerned about when the next setback will hit. I go for a checkup at the doctors on Monday but she seems certain that all my symptoms are to do with anxiety/getting used to sertraline.

Based on the picture, you know who's the favorite.

French Coffee- this is a yay or nay kind of situation. Case to case basis. I like it, it smells like a sweet coffee candy and a little bit burnt. Maybe if you will commute in the public they might think who spilled a coffee on their clothes. 
I kinda like it, it smells unique but my boyfriend doesn't so I don't wear it when we're together.
___
Zahrat Hawaii- actually I expected a lot from this and I was excited to received it but as you see it's not very used because I dont like it much. It doesn't smell bad bad it's not what I like, I get kinda nauseaus when I smell it. I really thought ut smelled like a clean and breezy but no... 
It smells like a tropical fruity fresh perfume. Too fruity for me sadly. Like fresh citrus, pineapples, coconut, some flowers but more on fruity.
___
My favorite amongst all batches I had is the Blue rose- this is the perfume I expected the least. Like I just wanna try it but I really loved it. I had 10 purchases but this is my favorite and almost half bottle already. My bf always compliment this too hehe.

It smells like black currant (sexy kinda fruity), creamy, dark and sexy but still aquatic florals. It is complex I'm telling you-it smells woody and oud (mysterious) and at the same time it has freshness and flowery part. 

This is the only re-purchased bottle I will get. 

__
The last one. I don't have a picture of it but it is my 2nd favorite. It is unisex and my bf already used the whole bottle because he loved it and it nagging me to purchase more of it.
Al Rehab Blanc- most of the review said it smells like Lacoste White but I never smelled so I don't  know.

So my bf likes fresh and citrusy perfume- that's why he likes this most prolly. Way back, I though he is using his old perfume because it stays on him from night to next days. Then I asked him if he already finished his old perfume because he always smells good, then he said that he's already using the perfume I gave him (blanc). So I realized that it stays long in clothes and he smells good with it.

It is fresh, citrusy, a bit musky (like white musk). It's a simple smells but it is pleasant.",1,1761395006.0,u_Lumpy-End-2634,0,1.0,False

First of all, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to those who are about to spend their precious time reading my post. Maybe after reading this, we’ll have a chance to talk or maybe we won’t. Either way, I truly wish you find someone who’s right for you. My post will be quite long because I want to make everything clear before you decide to message me. Once again, thank you so much. ou can read my post as if I’m having a casual conversation with you

**I’m looking for a connection that grows genuinely over time from both sides.** ***Whether it turns into friendship or something more, I always value friendship first. because I believe real love comes from the time and effort we put into getting to know each other. Having friends from different places isn’t bad at all***. ***So let's be friend first, and let time show us what comes next.***

**I don't do voice call ! I prefer chatting over voice calls.**

**ABOUT YOU?**

**- Age: 27 - 33**

**-** Single (of course)

\- I just hope that if we’re on the same page, you’re serious when messaging me. Being serious doesn’t mean boring - it just means genuinely wanting to get to know each other.

\- I hope you’ll be open with me, because that’s important for us to build a real connection, right? I don’t mean you have to open up too much the first time we talk, we can just take our time and slowly get more comfortable and open with each other.

\- I'm the kind of person who doesn’t ask a lot of questions, and my energy usually depends on the person I'm talking with. What I mean is, if you’re a quiet person, I’m really sorry I probably won’t be able to keep the conversation going. But if you’re talkative and like asking questions, I’ll match your energy and ask you right back.

\- **What am I attracted to?**: I don't know what is the name of this body type - I like muscular chubby(?) or maybe your body type is not like that - still okayyy, beards, foodie (like Asian food pleaseeee especially Viet food >.<) and also know to cook ( LOVE TO COOK ) , open-minded, fun, and playful person. When you truly understand what you want and need, do you think you’re ready for something like a long-distance relationship? Or do you just want someone to connect and talk with? I like a man who’s honest and straightforward, someone who doesn’t lie or beat around the bush. I like sweet guys, but not the overly cheesy kind. (I mean the ones who are naturally sweet, not trying to act like it when it’s not really their personality.)

**ABOUT ME!!!**

\- I'm Vietnamese and also live in Vietnam, you can see lot of pictures that I took in Vietnam and also Vietnamese food. **Time zone doesn't matter. It depends on whether both of us want to spend time together or not.**

\- I'm 23 years old, I know it might seem unusual for a to want to talk to people much older, but I often interact with older folks - they’ve helped me think things through and I’ve learned a lot from them. Of course, not everyone is perfect, but I really value the experience.

\- **Appearance:** 5'7 , chubby , glasses, brown eyes, black long curly hair (not natural), I don’t really judge whether I’m beautiful or not. I’m just a simple girl who doesn’t wear much makeup and prefers a modest, comfortable style.

\- **Personality:** **straightforward** (I’m straightforward, but that doesn’t mean I don’t respect you or being rude) , sometime I **swear a lot** and I need people who don’t get bothered by that or we can do that together. Honestly, I don’t really know how to describe myself. Sometimes I’m a very energetic and cheerful person, but other times I’m quiet and deep in my thoughts and that really affects my mood. Everyone has their own way of seeing me, eople see me differently, depending on their point of view.

\- **Hobbies**: going to zoo, museum especially history museum (even though I'm not good at history), reading romance novel, take picture from my phone - i dont have any a digital camera because I take pretty bad pictures, I don't play game much but I like watching Streamer play horror game and learning about that storyline - (Resident Evil, Silent Hill, etc) , love cookinggg so much, I’m an indoor person, but lately I’ve been trying to find reasons to go out more, to take photos of beautiful scenes and share them on Reddit. I really enjoy sharing the pictures I’ve taken. I love coffee and beer - I always want to try every kind of those. And....I do smoke cigarette, but sometime.

**My hobbies are pretty simple, nothing too special or cool. But I don’t mind hearing about yours and learning from them.**

**- Music:** Rap, Pop, R&B, Instrumental music and EDM, also Vietnamese, English and Spanish songs.

**- Movie:** Rom-com, comedy, action, Marvel (BIG FAN), sometime horror. I also love to watch How I met your mother, Modern family, Shameless, Brooklyn 99, Fresh Off The Boat, etc. **And a lot of cartoons, I also love Family guy - giggity goo!!!**

After you read all my post, If you are interested, don't hesitate to message me, **Please INTRODUCE ABOUT YOURSELF a little when you send me a message. Thank you!** I hope we will **CLICK!!!**

The AA Or Non AA One,"A simple test to see if you need to leave the rooms and if what I am saying is right. The fact is that AA does not work for most regardless of their whys. AA has been a failed program since the day it started. Here is what I tell people especially those out of the initial phases of recovery. Spend a week not going to meetings. Instead engage in physical fitness four or five days a week cardio based. Have a clean diet with minimal caffeine and sugar and decent proteins and carbs. Do meditation for 15 minutes a night. Start something to advance yourself whether it is getting a cert in your career or writing the first chapter of a book. At the end of the week see how you feel. Versus going to meetings every night or most nights, regurgitating your past in their negative circle. Sucking coffee and smoking outside at the breaks while you ingest sugar cookies. Compare the weeks. That test week above is my program of recovery to cure. You reinvent your life. AA wants you to mentally stay in your old one.

1ofq327,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ofq327,In defense of Flick the Fixer,"I see the hate for this lil fella mostly comes from him ""being narcissistic"" and making a statue of himself at Bone Bottom, calling it an icon of hope. So today, I wanna tell you why that is incredibly brave and defiance as opposed to being narcissistic and why Flick deserve no hate, if not some more recognition for the kindness he brings to the pilgrim.

tl;dr: Flick, in his own way, unconsciously trying to deprogram the indoctrination of pilgrims that they cannot actively do anything, including seeking help for themselves. The statue in his image is a way to defy against the Citadel's rule against any other faith/religion/teaching outside of its own indoctrination. Also Flick is just a morally good bug that is NOT narcissistic.

Let's start by breaking down his personality.

1. Flick is not entrepreneurial/exploitative. Often time, he complies with the customs (of pilgrims) in Pharloom and even recognizes when his wish might be in contradiction of this customs.

Right from the get go, the pilgrims are taught to just aim for the Citadel and not seek any aid. The only providers of aid are the merchants (by way of providing supplies to the pilgrims like Pebb or Mort. We know that with rosaries being a representation of faith AND a fiat currency, it opens the door to pilgrims being exploited by the less faithful/more capitalist mind. Like Mort, who guilt-trip Hornet for not trading and giving him rosaries, and charging pilgrim for staying at his inn, as opposed to Creige at the Halfway Home.

Flick offers aid by delaying his pilgrimage to fix things around Bone Bottom (stating so in his dialogue by reassuring Hornet he is staying only to help others/things need fixing). Perhaps not for Hornet, I don't suppose he will see any compensation from any other pilgrims. But because of him fixing the Wishing Wall, the pilgrims could get some help, like getting garbs and seeing threats to the pilgrimage (like the Flintbeetle and Skull Tyrant) removed. Even so, Flick does not put up a wish saying buy me a coffee or subscribe to my OnlyFan. The three wishes that he puts up all point out first and foremost are for the pilgrims. The part he asks for himself is the materials, which himself not being a warrior, might be more difficult to gather all by himself. If nothing else, this is a collective effort. ""This thing helps everyone, I can fix it, someone please bring supplies."" Even then, the wishes might be meant for multiple pilgrims to chip in, like 3-5 shell shards per donation. Only Hornet sees it and be like, sure, here's everything you want.

And Flick recognizes this. The way of the pilgrims is not one of negotiation or bartering, like the merchants, the couriers, or any other NPCs like the huntress and the Pinsmaster that can also give their quests via dialogue in addition to being put on the wish wall. The pilgrims can only simply wish, and leave it up to the mercy for adventurers to fulfill their wish/their faith being rewarded by their higher beings. So Flick puts up a wish instead of asking Hornet directly. And even in putting up the wish (Bone Bottom Repairs), he recognizes that he is asking for more than a pilgrim should be allowed to (saying ""Why, I even went and added a little wish of my own to the wishwall! Fair’s fair. I did build the thing. Seems like the kingdom should be granting my wish before anyone else’s.""). And again, the wish wasn't even for only his own gain!!! It was to help everyone at Bone Bottom!!!

So view in this way, the statue is also meant to be helping. We don't have any dialogue from him recognizing the statue is in his own image. But as I argued above, Flick might be recognizing that it is arrogant, but fair recognition, of his labor and effort in service of the pilgrims.

2. Flick might not have a degree in philosophy. But he understands hope. So he thinks a statue is necessary but might not be able to come up with a different model than himself.

The bug wants to build a statue. All by himself. He calls himself a fixer, nowhere does he calls himself a sculptor or an artist. We don't know if he is capable of coming up with a a symbol of hope that can inspire hope for the pilgrims, in addition to one that he can create.

About what can inspire hope, these pilgrims supposedly come from all over the place, may not even share a language, much less customs and understanding. Take for example, Shakra coming from a place where battle stance is a greeting, something that scares the other pilgrims. So what kind of symbolism that can inspire hope but is also simple enough that it can speak to as many pilgrims as possible? Well, they all understand faith (if not religion) at least. And they understand stories. Based on the fact that they make camp here at Bone Bottom and talk to one another, a statue of someone might be a good ice breaker. It'll be easier for newly arrived pilgrims to be curious about a statue of someone as opposed to a statue of ""something"". Heck, might even help the new arrivals feel more at ease if they have a shared ""someone easy to pick on"" (like ""heh look at that pilgrim guy making a statue of himself, isn't that narcissistic?""). The fact that they don't even know the name of another random pilgrim (like Pilby for example), indicates that they don't care much about other pilgrims at the camp. But someone like Flick who goes around fixing things up, and then have a statue of him as the first thing new arrivals will see? That will get conversation going. That might even help fellow pilgrims bond with each other, now that guided tour group isn't a thing anymore due to the haunting.

You may counter, but what about any other thing inspired by the Citadel? A symbolism of the spinning tool, GMS, the choir, anything that indicates the success of the pilgrimage perhaps? Well, one, Flick may not know what those might be, due to him never having arrived at the Citadel. Besides, copyright infringement aside, there are enough Citadel stuff lying around indicating this is the path of pilgrimage, such as the supposed Pious Isamor statue in the background of Bone Bottom (thanks [YouTuber El Chiefo for this discovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0ehkWCx1kQ)). I'd even argue those stuff don't necessarily inspire hope, as 1) they are likely commissioned by the Citadel to indoctrinate, not by someone who has successfully arrived then returned to tell the tales (cause they're stuck in the Underworks or why would they ever leave the Citadel?) and 2) at this point the Citadel doesn't want more pilgrims! 

Yet another point to support a statue of a person as opposed to something more abstract, is the statues of Nyleth and Skarrsinger Karmelita, shard statues of various kind of ""beast"" bugs, as well as the various Chapels worshipping the literal shell instead of symbolism of the shell. These artifacts indicate that in Pharloom, the bugs understand individual bug and figure that has significant influence on their surrounding. Flick has at least known the existence of the Ruined Chapel, even if he doesn't know of Nyleth and Karmelita. So in his limited understanding, he might have thought, ah yes, let's put me up there, if nothing else, that is fair compensation for my effort to help others.

With all that about Flick is done, here's the part he needs help with that I want to argue for: 

3. The statue IN HIS IMAGE is NECESSARY.

Lacking written work, oral history is THE WAY for knowledge and more importantly, message, to be passed down. And from oral history comes the making of myths and legends that can help inspire something better down the line. I'd argue that it is way easier to share stories of a common bug going around helping people, and elevate that to become an example of good things can still happen around Pharloom, REGARDLESS of the Citadel and its doing. Much easier compared to put up a shell shard statue of a silken cocoon, the literal symbol of the kingdom yet only a few bugs even know that the GMS is inside. What would that inspire, instead of further indoctrination of the promises made and not kept by the pilgrimage and the Citadel?

But tying this back to the whole pilgrimage thing: Flick is delaying his own pilgrimage to take active action (something we all praise Sherma for as a character arc) right from the get-to to help others, instead of relying on pure faith, and yet does not bargain or negotiate, complying with the customs that is making wishes on the wall. His action inspires hope in a way that DOES NOT confront the belief of the pilgrim like how Hornet and Shakra first looked upon the pilgrims. Instead, his action inspires change/evolution just like that of Sherma. That goodness can come from direct action and taking care of each other, regardless of where your faith is directed. 

So to use his image is the most direct way to start this conversation for any pilgrims. Upon arriving at the camp, they'd be drawn to ask, who is this guy and why is his statue up there? And be drawn to these conversations about why indeed, does he do all of these things?

The sad thing for us, the players though, is Flick doesn't seem like he understands enough the significance of his action to be able to verbalize any of this. So he simply thinks, yeah, I did all the work, might as well get the recognition. Which, if just by itself, SHOULD BE ALSO FAIR. LIKE SHIT, HE IS THE KIND OF BUG THAT HELPED MOVE AN ENTIRE SURVIVOR CAMP IN ACT 3. Bro came here to pilgrimage and upon seeing the sorry ass state of the Citadel decided that nah, I'd be here helping others first.

He doesn't even ask for thanks or recognition from others. Yes, it is quite arrogant and presumptuous to just put a statue of yourself anywhere in Pharloom. But honestly, even Hornet tells Scrounge the Relic seeker to recognize Hornet's effort in gathering the relics once you complete the collection, and Scrounge just ignore it. You don't see anyone going around berating Hornet for that!! So if nothing else, this bug was just minding his business!!

But, the larger point should still be, even if Flick doesn't get it, his statue is necessary in making changes, at least at Bone Bottom. I can very well imagine a scenario where if Act 3 doesn't happen and GMS/Hornet keeps being the sleeping monarch, then future generation of pilgrim arriving after Flick has passed away would look upon his statue with reverence and respect. For someone who has done what he could to help increase the odd for the pilgrims he might never even know.",27,1761394687.0,Silksong,5,1.0,False

The Reverend Dr. Miles Kelly is a composite of two people I have met in real life. The fist was a former Annapolis Midshipman that was a Tackle on the Navy football team that felt the call to god, resigned from the academy and joined the Navy as an undesignated seamen. When I met him he was a BMC on the USS Blue Ridge in the 1980s, The second was a former colleague that would come to work at 4 am, work his 8 hours and then go preach. I was an early guy too so we talked a lot usually over a cup of coffee. He would go to the roughest parts of Baltimore and preach to the drug dealers and all of that element. The man was fearless. When I asked if he was worried about being hurt, he said he wasn't worried about it all, if god called him home than it was his time. 

While I am not at all religious I respect those that are the ""real deal"" and will make personal sacrifices for their faith. Both these men made a huge impression on me and I thought in a book that highlights good vs. evil through the lens of self interest,  their ""voice"" needed to be included.""

Normally I have bowel movements after coffee but I fell asleep after. I had dry stool after I woke up but was relatively fine. Then i had spicy noodles and once I went to the toilet after eating them, I had constipation. I got back and felt bad. Like a little disoriented. Then i got shivers without cold and a little fever for half an hour. My mental level got really bad during this fever and it's been off since. I had constipation which got better with laxatives and pro bitoics though when I stop taking pro biotic, it returns. I've been to multiple GPS and they say all major signs are fine and I've done a comprehensive blood test which shows all major organs are fine. Only that I have vitamin d and b 12 deficiencies which I'm taking trratments for now. But my mental level is terrible still. And it began that day and hasn't gotten better. I feel weird about my body. Like sometimes i forget im a human with hands and legs and feel like I won't be able to move them but I still can never had an issue.  Mentally i can remember fine but there's this weird feeling of ""is this for real ?"" for everything. I still play video games and win just fine in them. And I work as a web developer just fine with long hours of coding. I think this is strictly a gut issue since it began the day i had the noodles. Before, I always got bowel movmeents after drinking cofeee for like 2 years but now i only get acidity without any bowel movements. Without probiotics the stool is dark and hard to pass but it's brighter and better with pro biotic. There's moments of mental clarity when i do get bowel movements but overall i havent felt full health for 2 months. What is my issue ? All the docs say I'm fine except for vitamin b12 and d ? All major organs are fine in blood tests. No headaches. No stomach pain. No vision issues or tremors or bleeding in stool or vomiting. Haven't lost significant weight.

My mental state is mostly what I'm concerned about. I feel really off and weird about my body. With some disorientation of where I am and who I am occasionally though not debilitating. I move just fine and can still do my stuff but I'm really disturbed mentally and I swear I was totally fine before the coffee and noodles. It's been downhill since then and all docs just tell me I'm young and fine with good blood work but this is the worst I've ever felt in my life and I genuinely feel like I could die. Any idea what I'm suffering from ? What should I look out for ?
