I'll be relocating to Fukuoka this February for a 3-month stay and I'm really excited to explore the city.

I am a Taiwanese-Canadian, 33M - creative agency owner, artist, AI-enthusiast, and appreciates a drink every once in a while.

I've heard amazing things about the startup scene there. Figured it would be the perfect city to reset.

I'm particularly interested in connecting with people in the **creative and fine arts community** \- whether that's artists, designers, or anyone working at the intersection of art and tech. Would love to grab a drink or coffee, visit galleries, or hear about any creative spaces/events happening in the city.

Also looking for any general advice on:

* **Mid-term housing recommendations** (3 months) - which services or areas should I look into?
* **Food spots** \- both local favorites and hidden gems
* **Best neighborhoods to live in** for someone who wants to be connected to the creative/startup scene

Any tips, recommendations, or offers to connect would be hugely appreciated. Thanks in advance! Feel free to shoot me a DM if you're interested in connecting.

1psp59q,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1psp59q/husband_spiked_my_drink/,Husband spiked my drink,"Me (34F) and my husband (35M) are having some big problems. I want to leave for me, but don't know how to protect my children if I do (12, 11, 9 YO).
Some background.... We have been together since we were 17 & 18. We were raised mormon and were all in on it (read: unable to develop emotionally and sexually in a healthy way). My parents were also physically and emotionally abusive. My husband treats me better than they ever did. So much has changed for us in the last 4 years, and we stopped attending church 3 years ago.  
During this time of change, we tried drinking for the first time ever. What I thought was our first time drinking together, was not in fact his first time. He had been sneaking behind my back trying out a bunch of things that were against our religion. (Smoking, drinking , coffee, tea). Now, I don't have an issue with any of these things. I never have, and I always expressed to him that I thought those rules were stupid, and I didn't think God actually cared about them. So why in the world did he hide it all from me? I don't know. And he still won't really truthfully have an honest, open discussion about it. 
So anyways, I don't trust him. I've watched him lie to my face a hundred times, gaslight me, lie to himself, and not take responsibility for things enough times that I really don't trust him. 
So ok, that was 4 years ago that I first tried drinking. By now, I've experimented enough with drinking that I know what I like and some of what I don't, and I know some of my limits and what my tolerance is. My tolerance is less than his, and he will always get going on drinking before me, and he doesn't seem to think it matters it one of us is sober for our kids or not.  I have a drink or 2 about 0-3 times a month. It's just not something I care about doing unless I'm sitting around out fire pit or in the pool. 
Soooo the kicker. This summer, I started on ADHD meds for the first time ever (life-changing in an amazing way btw). It's Adderall, and I wasn't sure how it would affect me. My husband wanted to get smashed and actually communicated that with me (wow!) so we could pick up booze. I told him I didn't want to drink because of the new meds, but I would get stuff for mocktails for me and then we could still have fun together. 
We were sitting on the front porch together enjoying the weather. It was one of the cooler days we'd had. He says he's going to go inside and get another drink and asks me if I'd like him to make me another one. I said , sure thanks, and I reminded him RIGHT THEN about how I wasn't drinking alcohol that day. He responded positively and went inside. Brought my screwdriver ""mocktail"" out and we were chatting and drinking again. Our 12 year old came out and was hanging with us. They asked what I was drinking and I told them it was a mocktail, just orange juice and soda and they could try it. I started passing it over and my husband goes, ""Weeell....."" And that's when I became horrified. He said there was ""just a little bit"" of triple sec left in the bottle when he made his drink, so he put the rest in mine. He spiked my drink with alcohol folks while I was in the first 3 days of a dangerous new medication. 
I was pissed and over and over again his excuse was it wasn't enough to hurt me. He didn't understand what the big deal was. Several days later he seemed like he maybe understood a little of what my issue was, and was both dismissive and reiterated that it wasn't enough to hurt me but that he wouldn't do that again. 
I just don't know how to protect my kids from him if I leave. I don't trust that he will control his drinking around them. He had a drink before leaving for the night shift tonight and it's not the first time he has done that. I told him I don't want our kids to think that's normal and he said that makes sense, and so I asked if he won't be doing that anymore and he shrugged. 
Is there anyway I can I protect my kids if I were to leave? If I can't protect them then I will stay because while I can choose to leave, they wouldn't get that choice, and I can't make them live with him alone if I can't protect them. My bestie thinks that my oldest would end up being the one who takes care of the other kids and everything while they would be in his care, at the very least. I think she's right, and that wouldn't be fair to her. (There's so many examples of why this would be the case. For instance, I went to the office 2 weeks ago, he was home and when I called the kids at 3:00 he was asleep and none of them had had lunch, 2 hadn't had breakfast, and they were all parked in front of the TV)

What options am I not seeing? I hate living with someone who I don't trust even though I still stupidly love him. 

TL;DR, I want to leave my husband but don't know how to protect my kids from having to be their own parent when they are with him because of his drinking and general irresponsibility when it comes to their care/safety.  ",1,1766373745.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

Can anybody relate to this and how do you deal with it? What is your protocol? Is there a breathing technique, a specific supplement, or a sensory trick that snaps the brain into ""Emergency Focus Mode"" without stimulants?

Starting when she was a baby, my fiancés parents would come very early on Christmas morning so they could be there when she woke up to see her presents. My fiancé and I live together in his house and are getting married October 2026.

While discussing our Christmas plans last week my future mother in law said she will be coming over at 6am on Christmas morning like she does every year. I asked her if she would mind coming a little later, like 8 or 9 because we’re hosting 15 people for Christmas eve the night before (including MIL!). She looked me dead in the eyes and told me no, she will not miss her granddaughter opening her presents. To be clear, I wasn’t asking her to miss presents, just come later! To make it even worse, she expects coffee and breakfast and forces me and my mom (who will be staying with us for Christmas) out of bed. It’s so frustrating because I don’t have a say in my own house and the last thing I want to do is wake up at 6am to deal with her. (I don’t like her at baseline) Opinions/thoughts?

ETA: feel like this is important. My fiancé is scared to stand up to her because when he does she threatens to not babysit her granddaughter anymore. (She picks her up from school twice and week and watches her until fiancé gets home from work). ",3,1766373277.0,motherinlawsfromhell,4,1.0,False
1psoz1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1psoz1u/strange_dissociative_spiritual_psychological/,Strange dissociative / spiritual / psychological episode after therapy + breakup — looking for insight,"I’m trying to understand a very intense experience that happened to me about three weeks ago. I’ve already spoken with my GP, psychiatrist, and therapist, and nothing obvious is “wrong,” but I’m still trying to make sense of what actually happened.

Background
•	I’ve been in therapy for ~7 years.
•	Diagnosed early on with CPTSD.
•	In the last ~9 months I’ve made real progress emotionally.
•	In March, my girlfriend of almost 4 years broke up with me. She’s very avoidant.
•	About a week after the breakup, I felt physical emotional pain in my chest for the first time in my life. That kicked off a big shift where I started noticing bodily sensations tied to emotions. I began journaling and working a lot on emotional awareness.

What led up to the episode •	Fast forward to late November (~8 months post-breakup).
•	My ex, who had moved to NYC, came to town and asked to see me.
•	We spent two days together, and the emotional closeness returned almost immediately (lots of I love you’s, hugs, holding hands, etc)
•	We’d been talking on and off for a few weeks before that.

Two days after seeing her, I had a therapy session. While talking about the visit, a lot of emotion came up—but instead of crying, I felt intense waves throughout my skin, like chills or energy moving through me. This sensation had happened mildly before, but this time it lasted for hours after the session.

Things started getting strange

Later that day:
•	I felt unusually good and energized.
•	I went to one of my favorite restaurants and was chatting with the bartenders.
•	Suddenly I became extremely aware of my heartbeat—it felt very intense.
•	I had a brief but disturbing thought where I wasn’t sure if the bartenders were normal people, angels, or demons.
•	That scared me enough that I left and went home to sleep.

The night

As I was falling asleep:
•	I felt a slow, moving sensation—almost like a charge or energy—travel up my body.
•	It moved from my gut → heart → throat → behind my eyes → brain over ~20 minutes.
•	At the peak, I had a strange vision related to resurrection or rebirth.

The next day

I woke up extremely confused.
•	I had a Zoom job interview that morning.
•	I was unusually honest and vulnerable.
•	At one point the interviewer said, “It sounds like you might be bored of this job—what would your ideal job be?”
•	I answered very directly and described what I actually wanted.
•	In my head, I had a strange belief that she could somehow “make it happen.”
•	I got the job.
•	I recorded the interview, and listening back, I sounded completely normal—just more open than usual.

Later that day:
•	I met two former colleagues (who are also friends and now best friends are you read what happened) at a coffee shop.
•	I have no memory of getting ready or driving there.
•	When I arrived, I felt extremely disoriented.
•	I was cold and couldn’t figure out how to manage being cold.
•	I genuinely believed I had been “reborn” and needed to relearn how to function.
•	I wasn’t sure if my friends were real, parts of my imagination, or something symbolic (like projections or angels).
•	At one point I asked them how they remembered things after sleeping because I was afraid I wouldn’t wake up. 
•	I broke down crying in the middle of the coffee shop, overwhelmed and feeling powerless.

That night
•	I decided it wasn’t safe for me to be alone (I live alone).
•	One friend drove my car home while I rode with him. 
•	Packing for one night took ~45 minutes because I kept forgetting what I was doing.
•	We went to his house; the other friend joined us. •	We called my therapist, which helped somewhat but also made me more paranoid.
•	I wasn’t sure if anyone there was “real.”

I called my ex twice:
•	The first call was to tell her very honestly how I felt about her.
•	The second was just because her voice felt grounding and comforting.
•	My friends commented that she seemed very kind and that they understood why I loved her.

Before sleeping:
•	I drank more water than I ever have.
•	I called ~12 people close to me to tell them I loved them and to resolve any lingering issues.
•	These calls felt deeply meaningful.
•	As I fell asleep, I had the sense that the people I loved were somehow “rebuilding” my consciousness.

The next day and aftermath
•	I woke up drenched in sweat but felt dramatically better—clearer and calmer. 
•	My friend confirmed the previous day was real.
•	I went home via Uber.
•	Over the next ~24 hours, missing memories slowly came back.

Now (3 weeks later) 
•	I feel “normal,” but also lighter.
•	I feel like I released a huge amount of suppressed material.
•	Presence feels almost effortless.
•	I have more energy when working out or running.
•	I make eye contact, say hi to strangers, and feel okay taking up space in the world.

What I’m trying to understand

Doctors and therapists don’t think I’m psychotic or manic, but no one has a clear explanation either.

I’m wondering:
•	Was this a dissociative or derealization episode tied to CPTSD? 
•	Was this some kind of ego death or acute nervous system release?
•	What were the intense waves through my body after therapy?
•	What was the “energy” moving up my spine?
•	What role did my ex play—was she a trigger, or a symbol of deeper unresolved grief?
•	Was this delayed grief processing, trauma release, or something else entirely?

I’m not looking for mystical validation—just honest perspectives from people who understand trauma, dissociation, or similar experiences.

Thank you kindly for looking this over. If you would, do you mind giving this a quick glance, and telling me whether or not you find it interesting? Thank you again!

The battle came at midday. The clash, the chaos - William Barnes would never forget.

Nature was in its changing. Leaves lost their green, painted gold and brown, red and yellow. Waving in wind over fields of ripening grain, patient for coming harvest. October was halfway through. Autumn grew older, colder, nights swallowed daylight. 

William sipped his coffee, the stinging heat a respite against the cold. Beyond the window of the café, life moved on. People queued on sidewalks, around shops and restaurants, crossing the intersection of the town of Teuta, enjoying a Saturday of peace. In the distance, rolling hills stretched unto wilderness. 

It was serenity. William eyed his wristwatch. *Time to get to work*.

As a Yuben County Commissioner, he could work remotely. Setting aside meetings, councils, petitioners and deranged folk who demanded his time, common tasks required no office. Pushing his laptop computer open, it booted - slow - then flared to life. His inbox was a swamp of unread electronic mail.

He huffed, annoyed, scrolling through the endless list. “Spam… Spam… More spam… *God, it’s been a day, I have to get this cleared out*… Huh, Doctor Pearson?”

Two clicks. The mail unfolded, spilling words onto the screen. 

“*Good morning, Commissioner Barnes.* *I hope today finds you well. As is my duty, being Superintendent of Teuta School District, it is becoming of me to inform you of recent happenings, some of which have raised alarm for my staff and I.*”

 Doctor Pearson wrote as he spoke - lethargic. Where in one hundred words, five could say the same. “*Continuous fighting, alienation between peers, decreased performance of our student athletes (a subject raised time and time again), and several other niche topics that are best summed up as - not good. In fact, just yesterday, I broke up a fight between two young men, Grant Santos and Kenneth Applain. Being it a Friday, I sent them home early, but it is no less unacceptable.*”

“*Furthermore, as I walk my halls, I often hear a term I do not understand - though* *Commissioner Kelly Lindsey has informed me of its meaning. This term is ‘Grey War’, and from what I have gathered, it is some conflict happening inside our Youth Conservation Program. I am aware you have a seat on the oversight council of this very program. This is why I write you today.*”

“What does he want from me?” William held his head in his palm. That silly little program, where they spoke with that ridiculous accent, and they all pranced about like lords and laddies - what import could it possibly hold?

“*I would be very pleased to have a conversation with you and your oversight council for the YCP. Just so I may better understand the workings of-*”

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

William stopped, looked, cupped an ear. A horn, deep and distant, groaned from the trees, then vanished. His swift eyes inspected the outside of the café. Across the street, an old man stood still; a young lady pulled off her earphones, eyes fixed on the lush treeline. People were sensing something - something William was not. Yet, the wood stood still. 

When the horn was but a memory, William scoffed. Whatever it was, it could wait. *Now, where was I?*

*“Just so I may better understand the workings of our youth, and the kingdoms they rule in the woods. Or so they are called; the modern hobbies of my students are still alien to me, even after two decades. I know little of their world in the forests, but would like to know more, so I may better understand them. Yet more precisely, I fear their fantasies are affecting the real world in a negative aspect, explaining many problems we face today.*”

“*I eagerly await a response, Commissioner Barnes. And before I forget, I must offer my sympathies for what happened to young Amanda in gym class. I can assure you, we are continuously prepared for further medical problems with your daughter, if they were to happen. The last thing we want is anybody getting hurt-”*

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

There it was again - the horn. William snapped to the window, searching for a source. He spotted it. A figure atop horseback sat on a distant knoll, dark against the autumn gold and sky. One hand held a horn, the other a grip of reins. The figure lingered, only a moment, then sped down the hill before William could inspect further. Many horns began to wail.

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

*“Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

“What the heck is going on?” William muttered, shoving back his chair. Cup in hand, he made for the door, pushing it open, entering the outside chill. The wind was dead. The town of Teuta was silent. Yet far away, climbing over hilltops, there was shouting. William did his best to make out the voices.

One was dominant, that of a child. “*Oblique order! I say, form in oblique order! Hundreds to our south! Hundreds marching on our west! Form in order men - Sarpa at center, Salutes on flanks. Cavalry, take to my heel! Ride, ride! Ride for Doral!*”

There was more than speech now, a distant beat like the rap of a drum, bordering on a stampede. *Just what is going on*?

 The hills of green stood inert, the forests empty. But the drumming grew nearer. Clashes boomed in quick succession; there were so many voices, William could not differentiate. At last, they coalesced into common calls, splitting the air. 

“*House of Applain!*”

“*House of Romero!*”

“*House of Grey!*”

“Grey?” William rubbed his jaw. *Didn’t Doctor Pearson mention something along those lines… The Grey… War?*

Then - silence. The air held its breath. No more rumbling, no more shouts, just stillness. That made it all the more odd. William's grip on his coffee tightened. He wished to scream, *Just what is going on?* Those on the streets looked just as confused, planted in place, waiting for the next noise, the next action.

When at last William heaved a sigh, he felt the wind sail by. The rustle of leaves, the distant hum of bugs and tweet of birds. There was… serenity. Not a thing was out of place.

Then came the cry that shattered the air.

“*FOR THE RIDGE!*”

They surged over hilltops, a tide of spears and shields, of banners and battle cries. Riding against the wind, hooves pounding against earth, churning green and golden ground into a mess of black mud. Faster, faster they rode, then turning, mounting another knoll. From there a second host descended. Spears lowered. Shields raised. Voices wailed; the rumble was deafening.

And the two hosts *crashed.*

 Some fell. Others pressed on, hungry for battle. Flags and standards blew high in the wind , a white dove, a golden snake, a red falcon, a rearing ram. Then came the footmen, joining their brethren as they battled over black grass. 

The azure sky darkened as arrows and javelins rained, launching, falling, striking mud and men. With wooden weapons, the warriors fought hard, breaking lifeclays, taking ground. Countless voices chanted.

“*Deo victoria!*”

“*Quis similis ferro!*”

“*Suum cuique saxum!*”

“*Doral vocat*!”

For a long, terrible moment, William could only watch. They were *children*. All of them, children. Striking, falling, battling as if men at war. The uneven ground made horses slip, keel forward, struggle on the hilly terrain. Still the boys fought. When he broke free from the grip of shock, William knew at once what was happening.

“Oh, crap! *Crap!*”

His coffee fell, black spattering over white pavement. He reached for his pocket, trembling, yanking out his phone, thumb swiping, dialing. It rang - once, twice, thrice. Commissioner James Thomann picked up the other end, his voice low.

“\**Yawn*\*, What’s up, buddy-”

“They’re fighting in the town!” William cried, rushing to the door of the café. Panicked people fled into stores, restaurants, as far from the hills and forest as possible. More figures emerged - children, warriors - missiles streaking the sky. 

“They’re here, James! They’re fighting in the town! You have to get here, now!”

“Who’s doing what where?” James asked, groggy, as if awoken at midday.

“The kids! The kids are fighting in public, hundreds of them! Christ, no, that’s got to be a thousand - a thousand of them are beating the living crap out of each other! Some are on freaking horses! Horses! You gotta get over here, we have to stop this!”

“The Doral boys?” James Thomann spoke with alarm, now alert.

“Wha-Wha, where at? I'm up, I'm on the way! What street are you on?”

William paused. In the chaos, he could not think. Despite the café being his daily, he forgot where it was. Eyes searching, he spotted two road signs. They read clearly - black on white.

“Moyer-And-Main! They’re fighting here, right now, in the town! Get up and get over to Moyer-And-Main!”

We are homeowners and I don't make enough to just move out. He's going to buy me out and the kids will stay with him in the home. Our kids are older and he drives Uber/Lyft so he can take to and from school, while I work your typical work hours and can't. 
It has been torturous to be here. He is so petty and rotten. I contribute towards groceries and he makes dinner but doesn't leave any for me. Not asking for him to make me a plate but he intentionally is eating it all up so theres nothing left for me to make a plate. If I park in the driveway and leave he moves his car to park in the driveway. He dumps out the water from the coffee pot so I have to fill it up to make a cup. He started an argument over a cutting board. He's online trash talking me to a point where strangers found my social media and leave me nasty comments and send mean messages. At one point he threatened my safety and my friends as well as his online friends.
The court returned our documents citing errors. Now we have to fix them and refile further delaying this process. We're doing it ourselves as neither of us can afford a lawyer. 
Sorry for the long post I'm just venting and could use some support to make it through these trying times.

Thank you kindly for looking this over. If you would, do you mind giving this a quick glance, and telling me whether or not you find it interesting? Thank you again!

The battle came at midday. The clash, the chaos - William Barnes would never forget.

Nature was in its changing. Leaves lost their green, painted gold and brown, red and yellow. Waving in wind over fields of ripening grain, patient for coming harvest. October was halfway through. Autumn grew older, colder, nights swallowed daylight. 

William sipped his coffee, the stinging heat a respite against the cold. Beyond the window of the café, life moved on. People queued on sidewalks, around shops and restaurants, crossing the intersection of the town of Teuta, enjoying a Saturday of peace. In the distance, rolling hills stretched unto wilderness. 

It was serenity. William eyed his wristwatch. *Time to get to work*.

As a Yuben County Commissioner, he could work remotely. Setting aside meetings, councils, petitioners and deranged folk who demanded his time, common tasks required no office. Pushing his laptop computer open, it booted - slow - then flared to life. His inbox was a swamp of unread electronic mail.

He huffed, annoyed, scrolling through the endless list. “Spam… Spam… More spam… *God, it’s been a day, I have to get this cleared out*… Huh, Doctor Pearson?”

Two clicks. The mail unfolded, spilling words onto the screen. 

“*Good morning, Commissioner Barnes.* *I hope today finds you well. As is my duty, being Superintendent of Teuta School District, it is becoming of me to inform you of recent happenings, some of which have raised alarm for my staff and I.*”

 Doctor Pearson wrote as he spoke - lethargic. Where in one hundred words, five could say the same. “*Continuous fighting, alienation between peers, decreased performance of our student athletes (a subject raised time and time again), and several other niche topics that are best summed up as - not good. In fact, just yesterday, I broke up a fight between two young men, Grant Santos and Kenneth Applain. Being it a Friday, I sent them home early, but it is no less unacceptable.*”

“*Furthermore, as I walk my halls, I often hear a term I do not understand - though* *Commissioner Kelly Lindsey has informed me of its meaning. This term is ‘Grey War’, and from what I have gathered, it is some conflict happening inside our Youth Conservation Program. I am aware you have a seat on the oversight council of this very program. This is why I write you today.*”

“What does he want from me?” William held his head in his palm. That silly little program, where they spoke with that ridiculous accent, and they all pranced about like lords and laddies - what import could it possibly hold?

“*I would be very pleased to have a conversation with you and your oversight council for the YCP. Just so I may better understand the workings of-*”

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

William stopped, looked, cupped an ear. A horn, deep and distant, groaned from the trees, then vanished. His swift eyes inspected the outside of the café. Across the street, an old man stood still; a young lady pulled off her earphones, eyes fixed on the lush treeline. People were sensing something - something William was not. Yet, the wood stood still. 

When the horn was but a memory, William scoffed. Whatever it was, it could wait. *Now, where was I?*

*“Just so I may better understand the workings of our youth, and the kingdoms they rule in the woods. Or so they are called; the modern hobbies of my students are still alien to me, even after two decades. I know little of their world in the forests, but would like to know more, so I may better understand them. Yet more precisely, I fear their fantasies are affecting the real world in a negative aspect, explaining many problems we face today.*”

“*I eagerly await a response, Commissioner Barnes. And before I forget, I must offer my sympathies for what happened to young Amanda in gym class. I can assure you, we are continuously prepared for further medical problems with your daughter, if they were to happen. The last thing we want is anybody getting hurt-”*

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

There it was again - the horn. William snapped to the window, searching for a source. He spotted it. A figure atop horseback sat on a distant knoll, dark against the autumn gold and sky. One hand held a horn, the other a grip of reins. The figure lingered, only a moment, then sped down the hill before William could inspect further. Many horns began to wail.

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

*“Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

“What the heck is going on?” William muttered, shoving back his chair. Cup in hand, he made for the door, pushing it open, entering the outside chill. The wind was dead. The town of Teuta was silent. Yet far away, climbing over hilltops, there was shouting. William did his best to make out the voices.

One was dominant, that of a child. “*Oblique order! I say, form in oblique order! Hundreds to our south! Hundreds marching on our west! Form in order men - Sarpa at center, Salutes on flanks. Cavalry, take to my heel! Ride, ride! Ride for Doral!*”

There was more than speech now, a distant beat like the rap of a drum, bordering on a stampede. *Just what is going on*?

 The hills of green stood inert, the forests empty. But the drumming grew nearer. Clashes boomed in quick succession; there were so many voices, William could not differentiate. At last, they coalesced into common calls, splitting the air. 

“*House of Applain!*”

“*House of Romero!*”

“*House of Grey!*”

“Grey?” William rubbed his jaw. *Didn’t Doctor Pearson mention something along those lines… The Grey… War?*

Then - silence. The air held its breath. No more rumbling, no more shouts, just stillness. That made it all the more odd. William's grip on his coffee tightened. He wished to scream, *Just what is going on?* Those on the streets looked just as confused, planted in place, waiting for the next noise, the next action.

When at last William heaved a sigh, he felt the wind sail by. The rustle of leaves, the distant hum of bugs and tweet of birds. There was… serenity. Not a thing was out of place.

Then came the cry that shattered the air.

“*FOR THE RIDGE!*”

They surged over hilltops, a tide of spears and shields, of banners and battle cries. Riding against the wind, hooves pounding against earth, churning green and golden ground into a mess of black mud. Faster, faster they rode, then turning, mounting another knoll. From there a second host descended. Spears lowered. Shields raised. Voices wailed; the rumble was deafening.

And the two hosts *crashed.*

 Some fell. Others pressed on, hungry for battle. Flags and standards blew high in the wind , a white dove, a golden snake, a red falcon, a rearing ram. Then came the footmen, joining their brethren as they battled over black grass. 

The azure sky darkened as arrows and javelins rained, launching, falling, striking mud and men. With wooden weapons, the warriors fought hard, breaking lifeclays, taking ground. Countless voices chanted.

“*Deo victoria!*”

“*Quis similis ferro!*”

“*Suum cuique saxum!*”

“*Doral vocat*!”

For a long, terrible moment, William could only watch. They were *children*. All of them, children. Striking, falling, battling as if men at war. The uneven ground made horses slip, keel forward, struggle on the hilly terrain. Still the boys fought. When he broke free from the grip of shock, William knew at once what was happening.

“Oh, crap! *Crap!*”

His coffee fell, black spattering over white pavement. He reached for his pocket, trembling, yanking out his phone, thumb swiping, dialing. It rang - once, twice, thrice. Commissioner James Thomann picked up the other end, his voice low.

“\**Yawn*\*, What’s up, buddy-”

“They’re fighting in the town!” William cried, rushing to the door of the café. Panicked people fled into stores, restaurants, as far from the hills and forest as possible. More figures emerged - children, warriors - missiles streaking the sky. 

“They’re here, James! They’re fighting in the town! You have to get here, now!”

“Who’s doing what where?” James asked, groggy, as if awoken at midday.

“The kids! The kids are fighting in public, hundreds of them! Christ, no, that’s got to be a thousand - a thousand of them are beating the living crap out of each other! Some are on freaking horses! Horses! You gotta get over here, we have to stop this!”

“The Doral boys?” James Thomann spoke with alarm, now alert.

“Yes!” William screamed into the phone. “Get in your car and get over here!”

“Wha-Wha, where at? I'm up, I'm on the way! What street are you on?”

William paused. In the chaos, he could not think. Despite the café being his daily, he forgot where it was. Eyes searching, he spotted two road signs. They read clearly - black on white.

I live around a wooded area, but have not had trouble with critters until now. I’ve had at least two mice in the last month or so. One I knew about because one of my three cats left it for me, the other, well, I found its head while vacuuming.

Last week, I noticed that the litter box smelled really bad. I got a budget friendly robot, and assumed it was about time to clean it out.  But, I found the mouse head this weekend (underneath the coffee table. Cats definitely were playing with it to be there). I assume the cat(s) ate the body? I cannot find it, and no smell. I did end up cleaning out the litter box and so far the smell is gone. I read that protein rich food makes cats poo smell. 

My question is: is there anything I need to look out for? The clumps from the litter look normal and all three cats seem normal. One of the cats used to belong to someone who was an indoor/outdoor cat. I assume it was him, but I’m not sure. Is there anything I need to do prophylactically? I would need to probably treat all 3, just in case if they did need anything? ",1,1766372765.0,CatAdvice,4,1.0,False

I recently had an anxiety attack at work, so I went out to the public parking lot behind my office and smashed a coffee mug on the pavement. No one from my office saw it, but a couple people from another office did see it. These were not people I knew, but they came out and talked me down, and I cleaned up the pieces.

I had also broke something a year earlier in my office, and had been warned that this absolutely could not happen again. So at least with the recent incident, I had the good sense to leave the premises and go to the back parking lot.

But even though no one from my office saw the recent parking lot incident, in a very stupid and panicky move, I voluntarily disclosed the incident. And in my email, I offered my resignation in lieu of termination. My resignation was not accepted, and by some miracle, no discipline was imposed. So I’m still in the job. Maybe I disclosed this incident because I was worried that one of the observers would contact my office and complain about my conduct, so I wanted to get ahead of it. Or maybe I thought I deserved to get fired, with a healthy mix of imposter syndrome going on.

So the question is, where do I go from here? I do like my job, which is as an attorney at a nonprofit. I’ve been there 10 years and have been promoted to a supervisory role. The last couple years is actually the first time I have ever felt like I’m decent at my job. So I don’t know why I’ve been struggling with anxiety so badly during this same time period. The people I supervise constantly message me throughout the day, mostly with questions that are relatively insignificant that they should be able to figure out on their own. But it totally breaks any flow I have working on my own cases. The constant notifications, plus zoom fatigue, and the constant billing in 0.1 hour intervals is causing a fair amount of mental exhaustion, even in a regular work day. Finally, I have been very conflicted-avoidant, and even mild disagreements or confrontations send me into a spiral. My solution to my project’s persistent failure to meet its deliverables has just been to give myself more work rather than hold anyone else accountable.

So clearly, the problem is me, but I just don’t know what to do now. Having stupidly offered my resignation, even when it was not accepted, I’m basically walking around in fear that I’ll be fired. I’ve handed my employer everything they would need to take me out at any minute if they want, but only by their good grace they haven’t. My boss seems like a good guy, but I feel like I’ve messed things up so bad, I don’t see how I could possible continue under these circumstances.

After all  this time, some memories deserved to be archived for  the next generation to discover  the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumnus is glad to write as many of them down that can be  recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.

There used to be a lanky freshman archie who taped his bandolier of spent energy drinks on the window in the Maggie Mo studio. Every night, it would grow seemingly by another half dozen or so cans. People wondered where he got so many cans. Besides Entropy, there was another way he got his supply back in the day.

During the late 2000s, a popular energy drink company had a bullish campaign strategy for the university. They hired a couple of blondes in sleek retro outfits to drive around in a chopped Mini with a giant drink can on the back. They would dart into the nearest parking spot, and then run on foot through campus, passing out drinks to every student they met and then fled before the University police could fine them for trespassing and soliciting. The Mini was fast, certainly faster than the little golf carts those rent-a-cops used on campus. I can't say if a high speed pursuit ever happened, for the Mini was gone by the time a full-sized cop car arrived at the scene. This cat-and-mouse game of advertising went on for a few years, and quite a few students got a taste for the beverage.

As for that freshmen archie, he always came back with more cans anytime they appeared. The bandolier grew to such great lengths, one might wonder if he drank anything else. Personally, I'd rather dodge the mysterious chemicals and stick to coffee but even I smiled at the ladies dressed up in shiny metal 1960s attire whenever they dashed to their getaway car.

After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumnus is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.

There used to be a lanky freshman archie who taped his bandolier of spent energy drinks on the window in the Maggie Mo studio. Every night, it would grow seemingly by another half dozen or so cans. People wondered where he got so many cans. Besides Entropy, there was another way he got his supply back in the day.

During the late 2000s, a popular energy drink company had a bullish campaign strategy for the university. They hired a couple of blondes in sleek retro outfits to drive around in a chopped Mini with a giant drink can on the back. They would dart into the nearest parking spot, and then run on foot through campus, passing out drinks to every student they met and then fled before the University police could fine them for trespassing and soliciting. The Mini was fast, certainly faster than the little golf carts those rent-a-cops used on campus. I can't say if a high speed pursuit ever happened, for the Mini was gone by the time a full-sized cop car arrived at the scene. This cat-and-mouse game of advertising went on for a few years, and quite a few students got a taste for the beverage.

As for that freshmen archie, he always came back with more cans anytime they appeared. The bandolier grew to such great lengths, one might wonder if he drank anything else. Personally, I'd rather dodge the mysterious chemicals and stick to coffee but even I smiled at the ladies dressed up in shiny metal 1960s attire whenever they dashed to their getaway car.

1psomfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/1psomfr/i_messed_up_and_offered_my_resignation_when_i/,"I messed up and offered my resignation when I shouldn’t have. My boss kept me on, but now I’m constantly worried","I need your help. I recently had an anxiety attack at work, so I went out to the public parking lot behind my office and smashed a coffee mug on the pavement. No one from my office saw it, but a couple people from another office did see it. These were not people I knew, but they came out and talked me down, and I cleaned up the pieces. 

I had also broke something a year earlier in my office, and had been warned that this absolutely could not happen again. So at least with the recent incident, I had the good sense to leave the premises and go to the back parking lot. 

But even though no one from my office saw the recent parking lot incident, in a very stupid and panicky move, I voluntarily disclosed the incident. And in my email, I offered my resignation in lieu of termination. My resignation was not accepted, and by some miracle, no discipline was imposed. So I’m still in the job. Maybe I disclosed this incident because I was worried that one of the observers would contact my office and complain about my conduct, so I wanted to get ahead of it. Or maybe I thought I deserved to get fired, with a healthy mix of imposter syndrome going on.

So the question is, where do I go from here? I do like my job, which is as an attorney at a nonprofit. I’ve been there 10 years and have been promoted to a supervisory role. The last couple years is actually the first time I have ever felt like I’m decent at my job. So I don’t know why I’ve been struggling with anxiety so badly during this same time period. The people I supervise constantly message me throughout the day, mostly with questions that are relatively insignificant that they should be able to figure out on their own. But it totally breaks any flow I have working on my own cases. The constant notifications, plus zoom fatigue, and the constant billing in 0.1 hour intervals is causing a fair amount of mental exhaustion, even in a regular work day. Finally, I have been very conflicted-avoidant, and even mild disagreements or confrontations send me into a spiral. My solution to my project’s persistent failure to meet its deliverables has just been to give myself more work rather than hold anyone else accountable.

So clearly, the problem is me, but I just don’t know what to do now. Having stupidly offered my resignation, even when it was not accepted, I’m basically walking around in fear that I’ll be fired. I’ve handed my employer everything they would need to take me out at any minute if they want, but only by their good grace they haven’t. My boss seems like a good guy, but I feel like I’ve messed things up so bad, I don’t see how I could possible continue under these circumstances. Any thoughts?",1,1766372200.0,Career,0,1.0,False

He is very nonchalant with affection, rarely gives genuine compliments, shows more reaction to negative things than positive ones, and makes little effort to make me feel desired or emotionally pursued. Sex feels empty and disconnected because there is no tenderness, warmth, or emotional engagement before or after, and despite me clearly explaining for years that I need words and actions to feel wanted, any change only happens briefly and then fades. I don’t feel seen, cherished, or desired, and over time that has eroded my attraction and left me feeling lonely inside my marriage. This isn’t something that hurts every day because I cope, stay busy, and appreciate our friendship, but the absence keeps resurfacing because it hasn’t truly been addressed, and I’m now questioning whether love and stability alone are enough if my emotional and physical needs continue to go unmet.

However, he really is a great person. He will change a strangers tire without asking, will make sure you have warm coffee in the am, will clean off 20 cars in the snow without complaint or anyone asking, will remember your order at a restaurant, and so much more. But he shows that to everyone. Not exclusive to me and I'm okay with that and love that about him.

I’m a 20 year old girl, and for the past two years I’ve been on a self improvement journey after failing out of college. I went to a party school, completely neglected my academics, and was dismissed. I moved back home, started working full time, and earned my associate’s degree from my local community college in two semesters. I’m now enrolled in a traditional four year college fully online (3.89 gpa) while working full time with special needs kids, a job that aligns with my career goals.

I’m proud of myself for fixing my academics, but I’ve realized that school and work are the only things I’ve been prioritizing. My schedule has been so full for the past year and a half that I’m exhausted every day, and everything else in my life has been neglected.

I cut off friends who were not good influences, and now I only really have one friend, who lives about an hour away. Aside from coworkers who are not my age, I don’t have people to grab coffee with or do normal 20 year old things with. I feel lonely and disconnected from people my age. And since my school is fully online, I don’t meet anyone through classes or campus.

I’ve also gained around 20 pounds, most of it during college, and my diet has gotten worse since then. I rely on fast food because my lunch breaks are short and it's cheap and easy, and I feel uncomfortable in my body. It’s clearly not healthy weight gain, and it’s affecting my confidence.

I feel stuck because I don’t know how to fix these other parts of my life. I can’t afford to move out of my parents’ house (I’m 20 and live in New York suburbs). The only exercise I genuinely enjoy is running, which I did consistently for a few months, but now it’s freezing. I’ve thought about joining a gym, but I know myself and I wouldn’t go unless it was a scheduled commitment. I’m not trying to make excuses, just giving context. If the answer is “get up and run,” I will but I just want to be realistic.

I also don’t know how to make friends when I feel like I’m starting from zero. I’m scared that I’m wasting my youth, and I worry that if I start prioritizing other parts of my life like I used to, my grades will suffer and all my work will have been for nothing! The thought that my 21st birthday will be me sitting alone at home makes me incredibly sad, especially when my 18th was spent surrounded by friends on a trip they planned for me. 18 year old me would make fun of 20 year old me.

1psoiwk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1psoiwk,"Request: Help me rearrange the Master Suite's WIC, Washer and Dryer, Wet Room, and Sauna Please","Request Context:
We are in the process of remodeling our entire home. The rest of the house design sparks joy. I am really struggling with the Master Bedroom's supporting spaces (WIC, Wet Room, Laundry, Sauna).
I have attached two images:
 * The proposed layout for the Master Bath/Closet area (highlighted area is the fixed footprint).
 * The full floor plan for context.

Our Constraints and Must Haves:
 * Footprint: The highlighted blue boundary in the cropped image is fixed. We cannot expand the room, but we can move internal walls/plumbing within that box.
 * Ceilings: 10' high throughout.
 * We like the single door from the bedroom to access the closet and bathroom and are happy with the walk through the walk in closet to the bathroom. I understand this is a polarizing issue, we've considered the question. 
 * Sauna: Must have a bench approx. 6' or longer (24” depth). Currently, access is designed through the shower (wet room style), which we like but are open to feedback on.
 * Laundry: Stacked Washer/Dryer must be located in the closet or immediately adjacent. We have taken into account  ventilation for heat, lint and moisture. 
 * Tub/Shower: We want a 66"" or 72"" standalone tub and a roomy shower.
 * Storage: We need a dedicated linen closet.
 * Vanity: We are happy with a single sink if it means better flow elsewhere.

We are unsure about:
 * The ""Vibe"": It feels functional but clunky. It doesn't feel amazing or luxurious like the rest of the house.
 * Linen Closet: I really dislike the current location (with the toilet tucked behind). It creates a narrow tunnel for the toilet and feels like an afterthought.
 * Shower Bench: The current plan lacks a proper built-in bench.
 * WIC Flow: The closet feels a bit chopped up by the W/D placement.

My Question:
Does anyone see a Tetris solution here that we are missing? How would you rearrange these elements to make the space feel more open and logical while keeping all our requirements?
Thanks in advance!

**The concept:** Help people find cafes by specific needs (quiet for work, has outlets, good for dates) using community tags and real-time intel.

**Tech stack:**

\- Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS

\- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)

\- Cloudinary for image uploads

\- Browser Geolocation API

\- PWA with service workers

**Technical questions:**

1. **Geolocation approach**: Currently using browser geolocation + Haversine formula for distance calculations within 25-mile radius. Better approaches? How do you handle users who deny location permissions?

2. **Multi-city scaling:** Started Houston-only. Planning expansion. Should I:

   \- Separate databases per city?

   \- Single database with city filters?

   \- Microservices approach with city-specific services?

3. **PWA vs Native in 2026:** Is PWA still the right call for location-based apps? Lower friction but limited features. Worth the tradeoff?

4. **Image optimization:** Using Cloudinary free tier, limiting 3 photos per check-in. At scale, what's the better approach?

5. **Cold-start problem:** For location-based social apps, how do you bootstrap initial content? Seed it yourself or wait for organic growth?

It's not random—we've actually become weirdly close over the last month, I started talking to him out of curiosity (he was looking like a student) and he was just so nice and open. He's quiet, super artistic (sewing,drawing,street art...), has immaculate taste in music, and also loves nature and adventures. 

We've had this crazy connection: read the same book at the same time without planning it, made each other playlists, spent hours talking during lunch break (on a bench by a lake!!) about life, art, and our families. We had really deep talks that were amazing and I love his way of thinking. I also decided to gift him a book (The Alchemist) for Christmas and he was super gratefull for it.

The problem? He’s a massive introvert. Loves his solitude, takes forever to text back, and at some point told me he prefers to eat lunch alone to read... so now we're not eating together anymore. He continue to come up to me to talk everytime we cross path in the buildings tho. He did told me that he wasn't used to being around a lot of people anymore and he needed a moment to read to relax. I felt like I might have overwhelmed him a bit too much. I also know that he's seeing a psychologist but don't know for wich reasons exactly. 

So his contract ends in the middle of january cause he's just replacing someone. I don't want to just let this fade into a ""what if."" I want to be brave and clear, but in a way that doesn’t freak him out. I need to somehow show him I'm romantically interested.

I'm thinking of:

· Bringing him coffee in a thermos one morning (since he starts very early in the morning). Or other small gestures like that to show him I care ? Or is it too much ?

· Asking him to do one specific thing with me outside of school, like checking out an art gallery

· Just being more obvious with my vibe, don't know how to do so tho???

🎬 *Directed by David Lynch*

✒️ *Written by Mark Frost, Harley Peyton, and Robert Engels*

**Agent Cooper follows Windom Earle and Annie into the depths of the Black Lodge. Big Ed and Norma get a shock when Nadine suffers head trauma. Andrew and Pete unlock Eckhardt's final box and Audrey stages an act of civil disobedience.**

##🪵 Episode introduction by the Log Lady

>And now, an ending. Where there was once one, there are now two. Or were there always two? What is a reflection? A chance to see two?

##🚨 Warnings from the Future

Be wary, travelers! In Twin Peaks, even the numbers can be...slippery. Some sources label the Pilot as Episode 0, while others count it as Episode 1. To stay on track, follow the episode titles, not just the numbers. Write it in your diary.

If you've just arrived in Twin Peaks, you should know the original U.S. pilot (1 hour 34 minutes) is the true beginning. It opens the door slowly, letting the fog roll in and the mysteries breathe. The so-called ""International Release"" (1 hour 52 minutes) tacks on an ending that concludes the case far too soon, unraveling secrets meant to linger in shadow.

##📢 Reminders from the Past

**🚫 No piracy.** Don't share or request links to pirated content. The FBI will notice.

**🚫 No spoilers.** If you must speak of things yet to come, wrap them in spoiler markup like so: \>!James was always cool.!<

**🚫 No brawling.** Be respectful of other travelers, and remember the best thing to do sometimes is simply nod and sip your coffee.

##🪵 Episode introduction by the Log Lady

>A log is a portion of a tree. At the end of a crosscut log -- many of you know this -- there are rings. Each ring represents one year in the life of the tree. How long it takes to a grow a tree! I don't mind telling you some things. Many things I, I musn't say. Just notice that my fireplace is boarded up. There will never be a fire there. On the mantelpiece, in that jar, are some of the ashes of my husband. My log hears things I cannot hear. But my log tells me about the sounds, about the new words. Even though it has stopped growing larger, my log is aware.

##🚨 Warnings from the Future

Be wary, travelers! In Twin Peaks, even the numbers can be...slippery. Some sources label the Pilot as Episode 0, while others count it as Episode 1. To stay on track, follow the episode titles, not just the numbers. Write it in your diary.

If you've just arrived in Twin Peaks, you should know the original U.S. pilot (1 hour 34 minutes) is the true beginning. It opens the door slowly, letting the fog roll in and the mysteries breathe. The so-called ""International Release"" (1 hour 52 minutes) tacks on an ending that concludes the case far too soon, unraveling secrets meant to linger in shadow.

>There are clues everywhere, all around us. But the puzzle maker is clever. The clues, although surrounding us, are somehow mistaken for something else. And the something else, the wrong interpretation of the clues, we call our world. Our world is a magical smoke screen. How should we interpret the happy song of the meadowlark or the robust flavor of a wild strawberry?

>Pie. Whoever invented the pie? Here was a great person. In Twin Peaks, we specialize in cherry pie and huckleberry pie. We do have many other types of pie, and at the Double R Diner, Norma knows how to make them all better than anyone I have ever known. I hope Norma likes me. I know I like her and respect her.

1.Cold-start problem: How do you get initial content for location-based social platforms? Seed it yourself or wait for organic?

2. Multi-city architecture: Planning to expand - should I structure this as separate databases per city or one unified database with city filters?

3. PWA vs native: Is PWA still the right choice in 2025 for this type of app?

We were chatting and a some point I realized we were all shouting because the music he was playing was extremely loud. Here I want to add that I don’t tolerate loud noises,  I can’t help it, it drives me nuts. That music sounds ethnic of his country and he’s the only one from there. The hostess asked him to lower the volume of the music. This same thing happened twice. After a bit, I set my presents all wrapped in a table and told them that I got gifts to play white elephant.

1pso9qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1pso9qf/cobenfy/,Cobenfy,"I started Cobenfy about two weeks ago. For me, the appeal was that it doesn't make you gain weight like Invega. With Inevga, I gained 50 lbs in two years,  had breast leakage at times, and constipation. Also I don't know what this means to anyone else, but I only got a period about 3-4 times a year. Oh, and my acne came back. 
With Cobenfy, my cravings have stopped and I've been gradually been losing weight, so I'm very happy about that. I will say, Cobenfy gives me worse constipation, so I started eating a very nutritious diet with lots of fiber. Coffee helps too.  Like Invega, I still take stool softeners at night. The only side effect I really don't like is the intense dreams that are insanely realistic, I can't tell them apart from reality. Before, my dreams were really surreal and a bit spotty, so as I woke up, they would just naturally fade away pretty quickly unless I wrote them down. Conbenfy is not like that. However, after the first night, my dreams returned to being what I was used to at night, but if I took my meds early in the morning and went back to sleep, they went right back to being grossly real. 
So, that's my take on Cobenfy.It came out in 2024, so yes, it's really new. I've tried Latuda, Olonzopine, and Invega and none were right for me! Latuda made me so brain dead I couldn't understand my old college essays! Olonzopine also made me gain tons of weight.

It sounds weird, but it was like a shock to the system and for a few moments the illusory and empty dream like nature of reality actually felt internalized and experienced rather than just something I know intellectually.

I moved to Toronto about 248  days ago (not that I’m counting 😅) from a small border town between Alberta and Saskatchewan. I was born in Canada but spent most of my life growing up in the Caribbean, and I moved back here about two years ago. I’m 23, around 6ft tall, and a Virgo if that sort of thing matters to you.

It’s been a pretty interesting adjustment moving from a small town to a big city like Toronto. So far, I’ve made a few friends mostly through school and Reddit but you know how that goes… people come and go, conversations fade, and it’s hard to find that one person who really sticks. I’m really hoping to find a long-term, meaningful friendship someone I can genuinely vibe with, share things with, hang out, talk about random stuff at 2 AM, or even just sit in silence and still feel comfortable. You know, that ride or die type of friendship where it feels effortless but solid.

A bit about me I’d say I’m a little outgoing once I get comfortable, though I definitely have my chill and quiet moments too. I’m currently in college and living in North York. I love hiking (especially discovering new trails around Ontario), cooking (trying new recipes or making comfort food from home), watching TikToks or random YouTube videos, and just relaxing after a long day. I also really enjoy exploring new neighborhoods, restaurants, coffee shops, anything that feels like a little adventure.

I’m looking for someone who’s also serious about making a real connection. Not just surface-level chatting or ghosting after a few days but someone who actually values consistency, honesty, and effort. I don’t care too much about age or gender just good vibes, respect, and mutual energy.

If any of that sounds like something you’re looking for too, feel free to message me. Tell me a bit about yourself what you’re into, where you’re from, what kind of friendship you’re hoping to find. I’d love to get to know you and see where things go from there.",3,1766370571.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,0,1.0,False

I’ve been playing with this since I found I liked 15-20 sec 1:4 shots quite a bit with the beans I drink. The method is fairly simple:

1. Grind somewhere between espresso fine and filter coarse, specifically 55-65 on the K6. Changes based on beans and dose (15-20g works well but need to go coarser for bigger doses like 30g)

2. Tamp the ground coffee into the aeropress with the plunger, with a filter paper and bent teaspoon on top

3. Heat water to 80-98c depending on the coffee

4. Add water based on coffee weight in grams + desired yield, e.g. with 15g ground coffee for a 1:3 brew, add 60g water

5. Use desired flow profile to push water through. Options that work well include slow fill / brief payse / fast push through, and fast fill / no pause / fast push through. Shot times stay around 20-40s.

This deals with one main challenge with the aeropress, which is how to not disturb the bed, by using a teaspoon. Works well if you like filtered brews and have an aeropress already. I liked this so much I stopped using the espresso machine altogether, it’s very consistent and forgiving in my experience.

Curious to hear if others have similar aeropress recipes.",1,1766370565.0,espresso,1,0.57,False

Like finding a spot that's:

\- Quiet enough for a first date

\- Has space for laptop work

\- Actually good coffee (not just atmosphere)

\- Outdoor seating for nice weather

Google Maps and Yelp tell me ""good coffee"" but not ""good for what I actually need.""

I built [beanscene.cafe](http://beanscene.cafe) to solve this - community tags like #study-friendly, #date-spot, #strong-wifi, etc.

Currently testing in Houston. Would love your feedback and recommendations of spots to add!

For privacy reasons, I’m not posting a photo publicly, but I’m open to sharing one privately once there’s mutual comfort and genuine conversation. I’m not your average height lol I’m like 4’5 and I have short medium hair it’s brownish blondish mainly blonde with greenish bluish eyes 

I’m unable to work full-time due to a disability, but I do babysitting and live a stable, grounded life. I’m honest about where I’m at and believe love is about compassion, understanding, and choosing each other through every season. I value independence, effort, and building a peaceful life rooted in faith.

In my free time, I love playing video games and board games, watching movies, going bowling, and grabbing iced coffee. I enjoy simple joys, laughter, and quality time. I’m happiest when I’m doing life with someone—talking, joking, playing games together, or just being close.

My faith is very important to me. I’m a Christian and desire a relationship where God is at the center. I want to go to church together, pray together, grow spiritually together, and keep Christ as the foundation of our relationship. I’m open to denomination differences as long as faith is genuine and lived out daily.

I’m looking for an intentional, Christ-centered relationship with marriage in mind. I want someone who matches my vibe, values connection, and truly makes me a priority—not an option. I desire a relationship where we text and call regularly, check in on each other, surprise each other with thoughtful gestures, and aren’t afraid to show affection like holding hands in public.

I’m drawn to someone who is emotionally available, kind, consistent, and lively—someone who enjoys playing games with me, laughing together, and building something real. I’m affectionate, loyal, and deeply committed once I give my heart.

I’m interested in someone around my age, roughly between 27 and 34. I’m open to long distance initially if the connection is genuine and God-led, and I’m open to discussing relocation for the right person.

I’m not here for casual dating or temporary connections. I’m praying for real love, shared faith, companionship, and a future built on God, joy, and commitment.",5,1766370439.0,ChristianDating,0,1.0,False

I’m 28F, American, planning a spring trip through Amsterdam, Berlin, and Prague, and I’m hoping to start talking with people before I arrive to build genuine, comfortable connections.

A bit about me:

I’m 5’5, curvy/thick, friendly, expressive, and very much a talk-first, feel-it-out kind of person. I love wandering cities, coffee walks, bookstores, museums, bars, late-night food, and conversations that accidentally turn into hours.

What I’m looking for:

	•	chatting ahead of time to see if we click (mostly bc I need help planning this trip)

	•	building a real sense of comfort and trust

	•	becoming friends or friendly connections first

I’m not looking for anything serious or forced — just genuine connection, good energy, and meeting people in a way that feels safe and mutual.

I do work a lot, so replies won’t always be instant, but I’m thoughtful and intentional when I do respond.

If you’re in Amsterdam, Berlin, or Prague and this sounds like your vibe, feel free to message me. Tell me a bit about yourself and your favorite way to spend an unplanned afternoon in your city 🖤",2,1766370285.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I moved to Toronto about 247 days ago (not that I’m counting 😅) from a small border town between Alberta and Saskatchewan. I was born in Canada but spent most of my life growing up in the Caribbean, and I moved back here about two years ago. I’m 23, around 6ft tall, and a Virgo if that sort of thing matters to you.

It’s been a pretty interesting adjustment moving from a small town to a big city like Toronto. So far, I’ve made a few friends mostly through school and Reddit but you know how that goes… people come and go, conversations fade, and it’s hard to find that one person who really sticks. I’m really hoping to find a long-term, meaningful friendship someone I can genuinely vibe with, share things with, hang out, talk about random stuff at 2 AM, or even just sit in silence and still feel comfortable. You know, that ride or die type of friendship where it feels effortless but solid.

A bit about me I’d say I’m a little outgoing once I get comfortable, though I definitely have my chill and quiet moments too. I’m currently in college and living in North York. I love hiking (especially discovering new trails around Ontario), cooking (trying new recipes or making comfort food from home), watching TikToks or random YouTube videos, and just relaxing after a long day. I also really enjoy exploring new neighborhoods, restaurants, coffee shops, anything that feels like a little adventure.

I’m looking for someone who’s also serious about making a real connection. Not just surface-level chatting or ghosting after a few days but someone who actually values consistency, honesty, and effort. I don’t care too much about age or gender just good vibes, respect, and mutual energy.

If any of that sounds like something you’re looking for too, feel free to message me. Tell me a bit about yourself what you’re into, where you’re from, what kind of friendship you’re hoping to find. I’d love to get to know you and see where things go from there.",1,1766370279.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False

I don’t mind the fact that he has to work. I don’t mind the fact that I had to rent a car for 800$ I don’t mind the fact that I help around the house and with his kids or that he will not change his schedule in any way shape or form or even once asked what I want to do. 
What got me is the food. It’s no secret the food here is junk (sorry it is) and I eat mainly vegetables. I don’t eat meat, eggs or milk. I’m not fully vegan I eat fish and honey I can’t have any of the other things. 
The first day he said “you are in America just have some butter!” I let it slide. The second day he didn’t know what I eat. There is no “milk” for me for coffee when I come over to his house… basically I’m all on my own when it comes to food and he just keeps talking about it on and on and on. 
I exploded at him when he told me that for dinner one day we are going to a Xmas party at his friends house. I didn’t have anything to eat there but chips. The next day he asked me if I had fun and I said “it could have been fun if I had something to eat.” He apologized but I feel bad for “telling him off”
When you have ppl over aren’t you supposed to make sure they are taken care of? I know I would take care of him and I would buy dairy milk for him when he comes over. So why wouldn’t he do the same?

The ASO (as I now understand its called) is bent in the middle which gave my blade an interesting bend in the middle that I was able to straighten on a 3rd temper. Due to the bend the blade had some thickness issues that I had to sand the blade down. Just before the 3rd temper which made my blade just under 1/8 of an inch. 

I broke my cheap 3 pound crosspeen as well because the head was epoxied on and the epoxy broke. I ended up fixing the handle so I could continue working. During this knife build I had to remake make my forge a few times because the fire pot was small for what I needed.

As for the knife the aging look for the blade I used ferric chloride and distilled water at a 3:1 mix. Then placed the blade in a glass mason jar filled with 6 tbsp of coffee and boiling water. The handle itself is kiln dried red oak that I secured to the tang using Aquaseal marine grade epoxy and 3 brass pins 1/8 diameter cut from a Hillman brass rod stock. I used boiled linseed oil after the epoxy dried. 

My sheath I used some chrome tanned leather i bought the snap for the retaining strap from  Hobby Lobby. The leather rivets are old saddle rivets I still had laying around. I do not have a stamp right now to hot stamp my blade with my mark (initials) right now so I used a dremel to make it.

 Tested the knife out on two deer this weekend it held up great. The thickness and 3 tempers didnt see to affect the knifes overall performance at all. The edge held up great the tip of the knife is a bit aggressive for delicate skinning work.",14,1766369980.0,Blacksmith,0,1.0,False

So, here's what's working for me currently...

I like to get to a nice cafe, get some ceremonial grade matcha (not instant which is sweetened)... I gave up coffee a couple weeks ago after about 20 years of almost daily use... Trying something different and new... 

I find a nice place to sit, get comfortable and get onto spotify and also my downloaded music... I have some decent headphones (Soundcore Q20i)... I get into a meditate state of mind (only difference are my eyes are mostly open and I'm listening to music). 

Deep, organic, melodic house... trance sort of stuff... With nice bass and dreamy type of tunes... I then focus on my breath, focus on the weight of my body in the chair... basically a body scan.

I also enjoy people watching a bit... fascinates me just to see others interacting in groups. I'm a solo kinda guy. Usually in a new city every week and a new country every month...

Like right now... my thinking... has... slowed... right down... 

I can feel my stomach inflating and deflating with breath... 

the music is building up.... 

deep breaths...

so relaxing

There are moments it feels soooo good. 

I freeze hahah

I fix my gaze and stop moving...

I do this mostly in the mornings... 

Wishing you and all living beings a peaceful and enjoyable day 

OH, I also remove my flip flops and have my feet on the floor... a nice view also adds

•	Fatigue, hair thinning, dark circles

•	Post-nasal drip

•	Gas after eggs, meat, coffee

•	Tongue lightly coated

•	Alternating diarrhea/constipation

What helps a little: Pepto-bismol (bismuth), betaine HCl + enzymes, low-sulfur foods.

Tests: H. pylori negative

1psnkz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_marketing/comments/1psnkz2/would_you_share_a_spotify_wrapped_for_your/,Would you share a ”Spotify Wrapped” for your business?,"Hey everyone!

I’m exploring an idea and would love honest feedback.

What if small/medium businesses could get a Spotify-style “Wrapped” for their quarter or year, not a KPI report, but something fun, good looking, easy and shareable?

Think:
	•	“842 new customers”
	•	“17 late nights with way too much coffee”
	•	“3 new features
	•	“1 mistake we’ll never repeat”
	•	busiest month, biggest moment, small fails, etc.

The goal wouldn’t be analytics, but:
	•	storytelling
	•	brand personality
	•	something founders would actually post on LinkedIn or send to customers as a digital marketing asset

A few questions I’m trying to validate:
	1.	Would you create/share something like this for your business?
	2.	Would it feel valuable, or just gimmicky?
	3.	Would quarterly, annual, or both make sense?
	4.	What would make it worth paying for vs doing it yourself and what would you pay for it?

I'm 17F applying to colleges and had my entire application ready to submit. My essay took me WEEKS to write and I had it saved on my laptop which I left in my room while I went to work my shift at Starbucks.

Came home and my mom said she was ""organizing my desk"" and spilled her coffee all over my laptop. The entire thing is fried and won't turn on. When I started crying she got defensive and said accidents happen and I should of backed it up.

But here's what makes me suspicious, she's been passive aggressive about me applying to out of state schools. She wants me to stay local and live at home. Just last week she said ""you'll probably fail anyway so why waste money on applications.""

The application was due at midnight and I had to completely rewrite my essay from memory on my phone. It was nowhere near as good as the original and I was sobbing the entire time.

When I accused her of doing it on purpose she acted shocked and hurt that I would think she'd sabotage me. She said I'm being paranoid and dramatic. But I can't shake the feeling that this wasn't an accident.

The worst part is I can't prove anything so everyone thinks I'm just being an ungrateful teenager.",219,1766369133.0,raisedbynarcissists,41,0.99,False

One day they could be comforting me,

The girl I liked rejected me after about two weeks of hanging out. She told me I’m a great person, that I’m handsome, and that my personality is good, but she’s just not romantically interested in me. She also said that I’m not very “fun” and that I come across as more serious. To be honest, I am a serious person by nature, but that doesn’t mean I never joke or enjoy myself I just don’t do it all the time. That’s simply who I am. I don’t want to force a different personality just to be more appealing. What I don’t understand is this: if my personality is good and I’m attractive, then what’s wrong? Aren’t those two things supposed to be the most important factors? The thing is, she was very focused on her life, and so was I. We both spent most of our time studying and being in the library. She studies really hard, she’s disciplined, and she has a great personality. I genuinely thought she could be “the one,” and that’s why this situation is frustrating for me. If she weren’t such a good person, it would honestly be much easier for me to move on. We hung out for two weeks. We went to the gym together, I cooked her favorite food and brought it to her place, and every time we talked, the conversations were long and meaningful. We had even scheduled a date, but the night before, she told me she wasn’t romantically interested in me. She said that I was rushing things, but I don’t really see how. I didn’t text her excessively, and we were both busy with our studies since we’re students. I also didn’t spend much money on her, just a sandwich from Subway once and a few coffees from a vending machine. I’m new to dating, so I feel like I might have done something wrong without realizing it, or maybe there’s something I can’t see yet. It could also be a cultural difference, since I’m Persian and she’s Italian. As I mentioned, I didn’t rush anything physically. I knew she had rejected other guys before because they moved too fast or crossed her boundaries, based on what her friend told me. I was careful to be respectful and not do anything that would make her uncomfortable. Her friends actually brought it up to me yesterday without me mentioning anything. They said that before she made her decision, they told her she might be making a mistake by turning me down, but it doesn’t seem like it changed her mind.",6,1766368990.0,dating_advice,45,0.75,False

**3:30 AM, December the 2nd, 2025:**

I am updating because boredom and sleepiness is becoming difficult to bear.

I made myself a strong cup of coffee, which helped me wake up a little bit. It also helped me rush to the bathroom, which is something that usually happens when I consume food or drinks high on caffeine.

I completely ran out of things to do at this point, and going for a walk at this time is not exactly an option for me. There is nothing really interesting to watch on TV, and I am not exactly a social media guy. Seriously, this is becoming annoying, but I will not back down.

I received a call from my wife at 11:30. I lied, saying I was going to bed.

I guess we both could take it as vacations in some way. Sometimes living with someone for too long becomes tiring, arguments appear for no actual reason and one starts becoming irritated. I hope, although, that she is having a better time than me.

I will update later.

**6:25 AM**

Dizziness is starting to hit. I started reading one of my books, “The Imitation of Christ” by Thomas à Kempis. I grew up in a strict catholic family, but now, as an adult, I am unsure of my religious beliefs and my own worldview. If I had to describe them, they would be like a chimera— stitched together from doubt, habit, and fear.

Although growing up in a house that religiously paid the tithe every Sunday and barely had anything to eat felt wrong, almost hypocritical.

However, focusing my sight on something for too long is starting to feel tiring, every time harder and harder to do.

Once in a while I have to stand up, walk across the hall, stretch and then go back to the chair, since standing up for too long is also becoming difficult.

The most devastating thing, nevertheless, was starting to see the first beams of light through the window, and the singing of the birds, marking the beginning of a new day.

Sleeping is not just to rest the body and the mind. Sleeping represents the ending of a chapter and the beginning of the other, even if it is just two or three hours of sleep. Going through the night without sleep feels terribly overwhelming.

At least I got to see the sundawn, and I will go for a good walk in a moment. I really could use some fresh air to calm down this dizziness.

**10:47 AM:**

I made myself breakfast, I got really, really hungry at some point, and I cannot tell whether it was real hunger, or it was the effect of the lack of sleep.

I went for a walk around 9:30. I started feeling considerably better afterwards.

Fresh air and a bit of sunlight really does its thing.

I remember being able to party all night when younger, then come back home late and not needing to sleep. Then I would just act as a functional being the rest of the day.

Getting old sucks.

Coming back from the walk I came across Eric and his wife, who were also going for a walk. If you ask me, they look like the perfect family from movies. I bet they go to bed at 9 as late, and eat dinner all together with the TV turned off. They look completely different than my wife and I, who barely have any meal together, and lately we barely talk when we go to bed.

I will take a cold shower and then I will probably make myself some lunch. I know it is too early to have another meal yet, but boredom leads to hunger, or at least you eat to burn some time.

**7:41 PM**

I have to admit I am having a real bad time. I have been putting off updating for a while now, but because I forgot to do it every time.

After eating lunch I started feeling extremely sleepy, so I couldn't sit down without feeling I was going to fall asleep. I kept walking around the hall, my hands and legs shaking, until I felt dizzy and had to go to the bathroom to throw up. Doing it felt way better, relieving. Still, my head ached like hell, so I had to take an aspirin. After a while, my head stopped aching and I went outside for some air. Eric asked me if I needed anything, but I said it was alright. My face probably looked like that of a zombie, so no wonder why he looked so worried there.

I can barely focus on a single thing for many seconds, so even writing in this journal feels tedious.

I am tired, sleepy, dizzy and irritable.

The next thing I will probably do is make myself a big cup of coffee and take a cold shower, maybe that helps, maybe not. I am really considering giving up.

(There is a big mud stain that covers a large part of the following paragraphs, the only legible words are “sat down”, “ went to the bathroom to throw up” “I don't think I will be able to”, although without a clear context)

Day 3

**5:59 AM, December the 3rd, 2025:**

I probably should not have done that. Smoking has always made me feel somehow dizzy, so instead of de-stressing me, now I feel worse.

If someone reading this is familiar with videogames, my perception of reality at this moment is like when you have lag when you are playing, and things keep repeating or dragging. Apart from that, I feel weak and cold, I am really suffering right now, and I still have 8 days ahead. 

This is horrible.

 

Although I don´t think this is the same experience patients with sleeping disorders have, because I am actively trying to not fall asleep, while they can't.

It is still too early to go for a walk now, and the noises I heard a couple hours ago make me not want to go outside at least until daylight.

I will probably go to grab some air in the backyard, and then I will make breakfast. I am eating way more than I would normally eat. At this rate I would gain a lot of weight by the end of the 11 days, if only I didn't throw up every couple hours.

**7:20 AM**

I just ate breakfast. I had oatmeal with nuts, and had to replace green tea with coffee. Green tea is not enough at this point.

The situation escalated to the point in which the tick tack of the clock, the humming of the fridge or the singing of the birds sound exponentially louder. 

This is not an exaggeration. I saw myself forced to remove the batteries of the clock, or I will go mad. 

I cannot unplug the fridge, and I definitely cannot make the birds shut up, so I am going to do a meditation session, and then go for a quick walk with a big stick.

**11:32 AM**

Going for a long walk I found the footprints of what I believe to be a coyote.

If that is the case, I should probably be more careful. I don´t know how dangerous coyotes are for humans, but I won't take the risk.

For this, I considered it reasonable to buy myself an axe at a hardware store in the area. A grown man roaming around with an axe in broad daylight must be an utterly ridiculous spot in the landscape, but I would rather be ridiculous than to be brutally mauled by a beast, so I don´t really care.

The cashier started asking many questions, trying to start a conversation. Usually, I wouldn´t mind it, but today I just wanted to buy my stuff and go.

Coming back to the cabin I came across Eric's wife, who noticed my tired, pale and deteriorated countenance. She looked worried, so I had to lie to her. I told her I caught a stomach virus. I tried to be as superficial and brief as possible, I feel too tired to talk too much. 

I also admit I started feeling a bit irritated by the insistent nature of her words. So I made up that I hadn´t had breakfast yet, and I left. 

My cell phone call log is full of missed calls from my patients. I told every single one of them that I would be away, but sometimes people become difficult to reason with when they have problems. 

There is also a missed call from my wife, an hour ago. I don´t feel like talking right now, so I will call her later. 

**2:35 PM**

I had lunch around 12:30, and then I sat down to watch some TV.

It is getting real hard to stay awake while sitting down. Sometimes my eyes shut down accidentally, and then I do that little jump you do when you wake up abruptly, just that this time I hear a very loud noise coming from my head, like an explosion. I don't think that counts as sleeping, it's just a few seconds of semi-consciousness

One of those times where I had a micro nap I woke up to a knock on the door.

It was Eric.

It seems his wife told him I looked terrible and he had to come and check on me.

After a while, I had to reveal to him the actual purpose of my stance in the cabin and the nature of my experiment. He simply couldn't understand it, and I didn´t feel like explaining too much.

He offered me to go with him and a couple friends of his to go fishing in open water. It´s really odd how he can include a man he barely knows to his plans but I kindly denied the offer.

To be completely honest, I am afraid of the sea. I am afraid to explore it and to find what can be hiding in the depths. I don´t think I wanna know it.

Still, I said I didn´t feel very good, which is true, and he left.

**5:35 PM**

I threw up again. My stomach feels really odd, like empty, and it hurts at times. I had to step aside a bit from the diet I had planned, because it simply doesn´t make me feel full, so I ordered a big pizza, about the size I would ask for my wife and me.

The ache in my stomach stopped, but now my head feels like it is about to explode.

I had to increase the dose of aspirin from one to three if I wanted it to make any effect at all. I know this is not smart, but it´s becoming unbearable.

A moment ago I heard some noise coming from the locked room. When I pressed my ear to the door, I could hear the noise of rats, many of them. I can´t believe I have to deal with this now.

I will make myself a big cup of coffee, and then I will go to the store to buy some rat poison and take the opportunity to walk and get some exercise.

**6:57 PM**

I had an utterly embarrassing moment. After buying the poison and getting out of the store, it started raining. It was raining heavily, because a huge storm was coming.

I could have waited in the store and called a taxi, but I didn´t think it would escalate so much. I started running to get back to the cabin as soon as possible, but I tripped and landed straight in a puddle of mud. On top of it, there were people nearby.

I feel terribly stupid.

I know I should have taken a shower first, but I wanted to write this.

**7:35 PM**

I took a good, cold shower and then I put the poison inside of some cubes of cheese, which I threw inside of the locked room through a small hole in the door.

I hope it works, because if there is something I hate, that´s rats.

There was a big, silver christian cross lying on the floor. I didn't remember having seen it at all before. I hung it back on the wall. It´s very, very shiny. It's so shiny that it hurts your eyes to look at it for too long.

I am feeling worse and worse every time. Something is fundamentally wrong with my body.

I keep forgetting what I was doing just a second ago, and I even had to come and check on the journal whether I had put the poison in or not.

In addition, I have been incapable of feeling any sexual desire these days. The lack of sleep lowers libido and testosterone to the point in which you basically become an amoeba.

Three days don't seem that much, in general, but three days deprived of something as fundamental as sleeping wreaks havoc on the body and mind.

Right now I really feel like I am missing something, like if I wanted to say something, but I forgot what it is.

I guess I will watch some TV while I wait for the time to have dinner.

**9:38 PM**

I cannot stand gossip shows. I decided to vary a little bit and watch anything other than cartoons and the news, so I started zapping.

What I came across was one of these gossip shows where they talk about the intimate life of celebrities, who they sleep with, who they fight with, etc, which I find terribly pointless.

How is their personal lives more interesting or relevant than mine or the baker’s?

Celebrities in general disgust me. Most of them don't look like people, they look like caricatures of people.

Besides that, I ordered another pizza, which I devoured in a matter of minutes. I am really considering ordering another one now.

Coffee helps calm hunger as well, at least for a while, keeping me awake at the same time.

I fear I might be doing unrepairable damage to my body and psyche, but I will not give up.

PD: I noticed the cross lying on the floor again. Whether I never really hung it back or it fell again I can't tell, but if the latter was the case, it should have produced a considerably loud noise. 

**11:12 PM**

For some reason, I am feeling way better right now, like if I have had a good night of plenty of sleep.

I don't feel tired, hungry, dizzy nor my head aches.

Im not sure why, but I wanted to share the story of why I left the church. Maybe it's cathartic for me to get it all out into the ethers of Reddit. Maybe im hoping my story helps someone else out there who is struggling with the church. Probably both. 

Background: I am a 37 year old female. I was born into the covenant of goodly parents and I grew up on the east coast. By all accounts, my parents did everything ""right."" Im the 3rd of 6 kids, we had FHE every monday night, daily scripture reading and family prayers, never did anything fun on Sundays, etc etc. I was all in and never really questioned. I checked every box in my formative years. At 17 I was Laurel
class president and the ward chorister. I got my patriarchal blessing before graduating high school. I went to BYU-Idaho. At 21 I went on a mission to Salt Lake City (not Temple Square). The man who waited for me asked me to marry him 6 weeks after i got home and 3 months after that we got married in the temple. Within 5 years we had 3 kids. We were going to church every Sunday and doing all the things good Mormons do (and dont do). 

Thats how I grew up and thats what I knew. I started looking at things differently in 2019, I was 31 years old. My husband came out and told me he was gay. He was my best friend and I loved him very much. In the moment I wasn't thinking about me, I was concerned for him and his well being. He told me he couldnt live like this anymore and he thought he was doing the right thing by marrying me because thats what he was always told. He told me he confided in his mission president that he was gay and he also told his bishop from his home ward. Both of them told him to marry a good mormon girl and have a family and it would just work itself out. So thats what he did. He was incredibly sorry and really just wanted me to be happy but he couldnt provide that for me. He also told me how painful it was to grow up in the church knowing he was gay. I had never thought about the church harming anyone because that wasn't my experience. But that was the first crack in my rose colored bubble I was living in. He left the church in order to live his authentic self and I saw how much happier he was. 

We separated and I kept going to church. I would take the kids with me on the weeks I had them. I started dating a couple months after we separated, and for the first time I was dating outside of the mormon church. One thing I didnt understand at this time was how I was expected to abstain from sex when I had been having it regularly for 7 years and all of a sudden because I wasn't married (to no fault of my own) I just cant do it anymore. Im supposed to turn it off (like a light switch!). I refused to do that. Its a natural thing thats not ugly or bad, so i had relations with other men and never felt bad about it. The crack in my bubble was getting bigger. 

Soon, the pandemic hit and no one was going to church. To my surprise I did not miss going to church. I had always been taught that if you dont go to church and take the Sacrament the next week will be harder for you. Your sins dont get cleansed and you start to feel weighed down. If you dont go to church you dont get spiritually uplifted and its harder to feel the spirit. I soon realized I felt the exact opposite. I felt relieved I didnt have to stress about getting 3 small kids ready for church early sunday morning. I didn't have to prepare relief society lessons, and I didnt have to make sure 3 kids under the age of 6 were quiet and reverent in Sacrament meeting. I didnt have to worry about smiling and pretending everything was great and lovely. I felt like so much weight had been lifted off my shoulders just because I did not have the obligation of going to church on Sundays. My bubble was really splintering and cracking now. 

By 2021, I was really on the fence about the church. I went to church maybe every other week when they opened back up. It didnt make me happy. My best friend was having similar feelings and we talked a lot about it. She was one of my mission companions and we have been close since the day we met. In the beginning of 2021 she came out to me and told me she was a lesbian, and didnt know what that meant for her with the church. She also expressed how hard it had been for her being a part of the church and being lesbian. I have always (since high school) had gay friends and it never bothered me. They were some of my best friends and they are just people. 

After Bestie came out, I knew that being gay was not wrong and they should be able to love and get married because why shouldn't they. I then realized if I knew this to be true, that meant the Family: a Proclamation to the World was wrong. If that was wrong, Gordon Hinckley was wrong. If he was wrong all prophets are wrong, and if all prophets are wrong Joseph Smith was wrong and the church as a whole is false. It was a domino effect and my rose colored bubble completely shattered. I knew it was over and Im pretty sure i felt all the emotions at the same time. 

Soon after, me and bestie went on a weekend getaway and drank wine and coffee for the first time, and we both got tattoos. It was the best weekend of my life to this day. We celebrated freedom and regaining our own power.  I remember saying to her that before that point it was always too hard to leave. Now it was too hard to stay. 

There were a lot of other things that caused splinters and cracks and made me question things. But that moment, I think was the biggest thing. I do remember at one point (I cant remember if it was before or after this realization - I think it was after) I was reading my patriarchal blessing and that 100% broke me and thats when I got angry. It told me to go on a mission while I was young (so I did even though I didnt really want to at the time). It told me if I was faithful and followed in the path of the righteous I would find my eternal partner and get married in the temple. I had THE MOST faith. I was all believing. It said I would be happy in motherhood and as a wife (I was not happy in motherhood no matter how much I read scriptures and prayed). I was promised a lifetime of happiness and joy if I stayed faithful. I got angry because I did ALL the things. I was so faithful and did everything I was ""supposed"" to. I married my now ex-husband because I really felt like God told me to. And now I was divorced and a single mom. I was angry because thats not the life that was promised to me. That was another shattering moment in me realizing the church was just not true. 

I told my parents I was leaving the church. They asked some questions but didnt say much else. They told me they loved me and thats the last time in 4.5 years we have talked about it. 

After I told my parents, I wrote a post on facebook letting everyone know where I stood with the church and I would no longer be a member. I did this because I didnt want to have to keep telling everyone the same thing over and over. I thought this would be the best way to spread the word the fastest. 

Around the same time as my facebook post my sibling came out as non-binary and told me they were also leaving the church. 

Since then, one of my brothers has left, and my sister is riding the fence. I have re-married and I couldn't be happier. My oldest is now 13 and has thanked me for leaving the church when I did. Its been a long road mixed with sadness, anger, hurt, nostalgia, happiness, and loss. 

I would like to let anyone in the beginning stages of leaving the church know that even though its hard, you are strong and life is great  on the outside. You are not alone. Im open to chatting with people if anyone wants to. Thanks for reading if you got this far!",60,1766368227.0,exmormon,15,0.99,False

I shut off the faucet, dried my hands, briefly adjusted my tie in the mirror, and when I looked down, shit, there it was: a rolled-up square of loose-leaf paper, propped against the side of the drain, held tightly together by what appeared to be a strand of thin black thread or yarn. I pinched the end and dropped it in my palm. Dry as dust. Not an ounce of moisture on the damn thing. 

It didn't make much sense.

“Very funny...” I muttered, chuckling. The words simply reverberated around the empty men’s room.

I twisted my neck side to side - nobody.

I peeked under each stall, figuring I’d catch Tim squatting on a toilet, suppressing a wolfish giggle, but found no one.

It was a strange prank, undeniably, but that wouldn’t exactly be out of the norm at *Happy Harlot Advertising.* 

*They must have lobbed it into the basin when I was distracted...* \- I thought.

Did that explanation make sense? No, not at all. I mean, if that was the case, why didn’t I hear the hinges of the bathroom door creaking? Why didn’t I catch a glimpse of someone in the mirror? Or, better yet, a glimpse of the note flying through the air? 

But I ignored those nagging questions and tugged at the thread.

The note unfurled. I dragged my fingers across the paper. Whoever wrote it did so with force; so much force that they created tiny indents in the looseleaf.   

In jagged blue letters, it read: 

*“HE IS TRYING TO STEAL WHAT IS YOURS”* 

“Who? Tim?” I whispered.

My heart began to gallop. My thoughts grew feverish, imagining myself being fired for what felt like the millionth time. Visions of being replaced by Tim, a younger, smarter, more passionate version of myself: the inevitable upgrade. Pressure built along my skin. Hostile gravity threatened to crush me like a soda can disappearing under the wheel of a steamroller. 

I crumpled the note into a ball before it could do the same to me and launched it into a trash can. 

The thread, however, was harder to dispose of. Not only did it feel nice running between my fingertips, but, strangely, it made me feel safer in a way that's difficult to put to words. Same sort of safety you'd feel carrying around a lucky charm, I guess. I felt protected.

And as long as I ignored one final question, that sense of protection would remain firm.

*Why does this feel like hair...?*

I pocketed the strands and jogged out of the bathroom.

An hour later, Fox called my team to the boardroom for Tim’s presentation. I suffered through it with a pit in my stomach like I’d swallowed a cannonball. 

It was...good. 

No, that’s not true - his presentation was *great*. Genuinely remarkable. His proposal was innovative. His methodology was cost-effective. He sold it all with such zeal, such unshakable confidence. There was fire behind his eyes. 

That was his whole *schtick* \- passion. The man had convictions. He felt everything very deeply. 

*Must be nice.* 

I slumped back in my chair, faking a grin, toying with the hair in my pocket. When that wasn’t providing relief, I swapped to old reliable: my fidget ring. A mobile, spinnable band over a stationary inner band. A tactile outlet for my never-ending worry. 

Afterwards, Fox pulled me into his office and closed the door. 

“So - what’d you think? Pretty stellar work, no?” 

I paced around his office, avoiding eye contact, thumbing the hair in my pocket. Could Tim really be gunning for my position? It wasn’t the first time I had considered the possibility; the man’s a wolf. 

Every man’s a wolf. 

“Uh...Pete?” 

“Hmm?” I stalled my hectic pirouettes, unaware that Fox had sat down behind his desk. He gestured towards a nearby chair. 

I winced; lowering myself into the seat forced my hands out into the open. 

Reluctantly, I let go of the hair, spinning my fidget ring to compensate. A series of grinding *squeaks*emanated from my knuckle. Originally, the fixation was noiseless; time, friction, and inclement weather had rusted the bands to the point of musicality. I prayed the sound wasn’t bothering Fox. 

The CFO’s eyes narrowed. 

“Right! Right. You asked me about Tim's presentation...""

I trailed off, distracted. Jagged letters scribbled in blue ink rocketed to the front of my skull. 

*HE IS TRYING TO STEAL WHAT IS YOURS*

“I’m getting the sense that you have...concerns?” 

I paused.

Then, a lie tumbled from my lips. 

“Well...some of the imagery looked...borrowed.” 

Fox leaned forward. His shoulders tensed. 

“You believe his work was plagiarized?” 

I scratched the back of my head, contemplated the potential ramifications of doubling down for about a quarter of a second, then nodded. 

“Alright then. Thanks for being transparent with me, Pete.” Fox closed his eyes and threw his glasses onto the desk. A sigh billowed from his lips. As I stood up, every inch of my body began to tingle. Liquid stress seeped into my veins. My heart rate violently accelerated. 

*What the fuck did I just do?* 

The rest of the day devolved into a hazy panic. Didn’t get a shred of work done. Instead, I split my energy right down the middle: half went to avoiding Tim, half went to keeping myself from vomiting. When I arrived home a jittery mess, Arden was quick to wrap her slender arms around my aching shoulders.

“Oh, I’m sure they’ll understand,” she said, running a tender hand along my side. When my fiancé got dangerously close to my pocket, I slid my fingers between hers and gently guided her away. 

“You made an honest mistake. Nothing more, nothing less.” 

Sleep evaded me that night.

I tossed and turned, writhing well into the morning hours like a man possessed. Contingencies required planning; I needed to practice how I’d respond in every potential scenario. The lies had to be second nature so I could focus on controlling my body language. 

Much to my horror, I encountered Tim in the parking lot the following morning.

He stomped past me, face flushed the bright red of a bell pepper, twitching, mumbling under his breath as he wrenched his car door open. The man sped away and he never came back. 

Later, I learned that when Fox confronted him about his presentation, he completely flew off the handle. Screamed his innocence loud enough that the damn whole office heard it. Even went so far as to hurl a coffee mug in the CFO’s general direction. It’s unclear whether he *intended* to hit Fox or not. Regardless, he had to duck out of the way to avoided being pelted by it. The mug shattered against the wall, leaving a pile of ceramic shrapnel in its wake.

And that was that. 

Tim was fired on the spot. 

*Passion is as passion does, I guess.* 

At first, I was borderline euphoric with relief. Before long, however, that relief began to sour, and a certain unease trickled back into my skull. 

I was alone in the break room, rinsing flecks of caked-on lasagna from my Tupperware, helplessly lost in another mental labyrinth.

*Yes, objectively, it’s not completely my fault. If Tim had better control over his emotions, he’d likely still be working here. Still, I’m not blameless; I was the catalyst.* 

I only looked away for a moment. 

When I turned back, there it was, propped against the side of the drain, tied at the center by a strand of someone’s hair. 

Note number two. 

I plucked the dry scrap of paper from the basin and began unfurling it. 

*Then again, if he* ***was*** *trying to steal my job, my goddamned livelihood, then maybe a preemptive strike would be justifiable...ethically speaking...*

The hair was blond that time. 

\- - - - -

Over the next week, I decided the thing in the pipes needed a name. It's not that I was talking to Arden about it - God no - it’s more that names make things safe. 

*“Rattle”* seemed as good as any other. 

The more messages I opened, the more I received. The more I received, the more I was able to perceive the thing in the pipes. No matter where I was, I’d hear it: a dull, shaking rattle, like a pool ball clanking around the inside of a washing machine, radiating from the walls, or from the floor, or from deep within the earth. It wasn't continuous. If I heard the noise, that meant a delivery was imminent. 

Was the phenomenon disturbing? Seemingly impossible? Laughably absurd? Check, check, and check. 

But did I care? 

Not in the slightest. 

Rattle was helping me.

I likened them to a guardian angel, vigilant and steadfast, keeping an invisible eye peeled for the leeches and the predators that wished me harm, weeding the wolves from my company. 

I wasn’t *sure* that my sister was dead-set on convincing Mom to cut me out of her will. Granted, I had my suspicions, but I never had the evidence to prove it, not until Rattle came along. It was a similar situation with Calvin. Who would’ve guessed he had been calling me a hack and sell-out behind closed doors? I mean, I sort of did. The moment I left the band to focus on my career, his attitude towards me shifted 180 degrees. Cold, vacant stares. Forced smiles. Never sat next to me at the bar anymore. The changes were subtle, but they were there. I just needed proof, and the thing in the pipes was more than happy to oblige. 

Of course, Rattle wasn’t perfect: the notes often contained small clerical errors. For example, my sister’s name is “Meg”, not “Marge”. And the note about Calvin mentioned him despising me for leaving the “team”, when it should have said the “band”. Wasn’t a problem. In both cases, I knew what they were *intending* to say, and, far as I could tell, Rattle was right about those bastards every time, so what did it matter?

Months flew by.

During that time, Arden started growing distant. Strange glances from her side of the bed before she flicked the light off. Curt, loveless text messages. I feared the worst, but didn’t want to jump to conclusions. 

My fiancé was still at work when I heard a rattling below the floorboards that evening. 

I pushed myself from the couch, plodded into the kitchen, and stood over the kitchen sink. 

*Any second now.* 

There was a faint scent drifting through the air, one I had trouble placing. It was woody, but with a peculiar hint of sweetness. Eucalyptus with a drop of honey. Whatever the scent was, it didn’t raise any red flags. In fact, I found the phantasmal aromatherapy quite relaxing. As I waited, my finger stopped incessantly spinning my fidget ring, and the grinding *squeaks* stopped in turn. Silence blanketed our house. Even the muffled rattling had ceased. 

That silence didn’t last. 

Maybe if I had been paying attention, I would’ve noticed something was desperately wrong. 

*Did Arden really have to “stay late” at work tonight, or is that a cover? An alibi? Is she using again? Cheating on me? Could be both, no reason it couldn’t be -* 

A low, whirring clamor blared through the room. Cold metal cradled my wrist. Artificial wind pushed between my fingers, like the breeze from a fan cranked to its max settings.

My right hand was pressing into the drain. 

The garbage disposal was on. 

I leapt back, ripping my hand out. A searing pain exploded across my middle finger. Cereal boxes and cans of soup clattered against the floor as my shoulders slammed into the pantry shelves. Eventually, the discord settled. Excluding my labored breathing, the house was silent again; the whirring clamor had disappeared. Across the room, the switch for the disposal was in the “off” position. Never turned it on, never turned it off. A warm, slow ooze crawled down my middle finger. The alluring scent had been replaced with the sharp, metallic tang of exposed blood. 

Trembling, I examined my hand. 

A nickel-sized slice of skin had been cleanly excised from above my knuckle. The injury was superficial. No wound to sew back together; just a patch of raw, gushing tissue. I wrapped the finger with paper towels and crept over to the sink. 

A note was resting in the drain. The accompanying hair was silver and brittle. I opened it, surprised to find that there was a second note concealed inside the first. Rattle had never done that before. 

In jagged blue letters, the larger read: 

*ARDIN IS SLEEPING WITH HER BOSS*

In delicate black typography, that second, smaller one read: 

*It’s time, Pete. It’s time to come down here. It’s the only way I can truly protect you.* 

There was a flicker in my chest. A brief rebellion. An honest recognition of the outlandish situation I’d found myself in. Before that ember could bloom, however, it was snuffed out. 

A sweet, woody scent slithered up my nostrils. Eucalyptus and honey. 

My mind began to twist. 

*I can’t believe Arden is cheating on me...*

*- - - - -*

“Admit it! Just admit it!” I screamed. 

My fiancé ignored me. She continued to stumble around our bedroom, throwing handfuls of clothes into an open duffel bag, eyes red and glassy, cheeks coated with a sticky layer of dried tears. 

“There’s nothing to admit, Pete.” 

“Right, sure - then why the hell were you late?!” 

She swung around from her wardrobe and bellowed:

“Because we have a deadline, for Christ’s sake! I’ve told you this! I’ve told you this so - many - goddamn - times!” The screech of the closing zipper punctuated her appeal. She launched the bag out into the hallway and stomped past me. 

I paused the interrogation.

My consciousness felt divided, waging war with itself, each half intent on tearing the other limb from limb. Unequivocally, my body believed her. My marrow was on fire, screaming that I was making a mistake. My mind, however, would not yield. No plea would be enough. No evidence would be satisfactory. She was too perfect to have settled for me. Something had to be amiss. 

From behind me, I heard:

“Where the fuck is the Kindle charger, Pete?” Arden ripped open my nightstand’s bottom drawer. Normally, it required a key, but it was an old piece of furniture. In her rage, she’d pulled on the handle with enough force to break the aging lock altogether.

My righteous indignation evaporated. Waves of icy panic surged down my spine. 

She was looming over the drawer, rendered motionless by its contents. 

I kept the tufts of hair on one side and the notes on the other.

By that point, the drawer was nearly full. 

A bevy of useless half-words lurched over my tongue, none of which provided even a semblance of an explanation.

Eventually, I mustered something like: 

“I’ve been receiving...messages.” 

The only thing she said in response was: 

“But...this is your handwriting, Pete.” 

Arden slung the duffel bag over her shoulder and practically sprinted from our home. The front door slammed shut, and I was still in our bedroom. 

I was used to feeling relief after confronting people with what Rattle divulged to me, but that time was different. At that moment, alone in an empty house, I did not experience relief. 

I just felt hollow. 

The minutes that followed are a bit of a blur. 

I don’t think I passed out. Not fully, at least. I floated above my own body, but I couldn’t really see anything. Just shapes lumbering through a thick, blinding mist. I resigned myself. Embraced the detachment. I didn’t feel worth the trouble of it all: letting Rattle protect me was much, much easier. 

Then, it hit me. 

*What’s the point of protecting myself if I don’t think there’s anything worth protecting?* 

The paranoia untangled. The mist cleared. Painful remorse fell over me like a landslide. 

I peered down. 

I was in front of the sink. 

But the drain was triple the size it should’ve been. It nearly covered the whole basin. Thick globs of ash-colored fluid glistened around the quivering metal rim. Hundreds of thin, pearly needles lined the yawning cavity, jutting out from a material that had the color and consistency of velvet: crimson, plush, smooth.  

Rattle’s lips,

and Rattle’s mouth,

and Rattle’s teeth, 

and my right arm was elbow deep within the maw.

I attempted to yank myself out, but Rattle was too quick. 

The drain snapped shut, narrowing the exact diameter of my arm in the blink of an eye.

I screamed. 

Feebly tried to pull it out again, to no avail. 

Then, movement: 

The mouth began twisting. 

\- - - - -

The doctor was very interested in hearing how I managed to flay the majority of my right arm in such a spectacular fashion.  

Lying in the hospital bed, my stump wrapped in gauze, I informed her I’d be more than happy to explain, but she needed to answer one question for me first. The young woman nodded. 

I leaned forward and whispered:

“Behind me, in the wall, do you hear that?” 

The doctor let loose a nervous chuckle and assured me that sound was simply due to noisy plumbing. Initially, her response left me crestfallen, but then, without prompting, she added:

“I will say the noises in your particular room are a little...strange. Shrill. Scratchy… ”

“Almost like grinding metal?” 

She nodded again. I breathed a long, heavy sigh of relief. Best I figured, if she could hear it too - the fidget ring spinning inside the pipes in the walls - that meant I wasn't insane.

It also meant Rattle was still following me.

“Why do you ask? What do you think it is?” 

I laid back, flipped away from her, dragged the blanket over my head, and shut my eyes tight.

1psn90u,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1psn90u/im_18_with_diagnosed_mcas/,I’m 18 with diagnosed mcas,"For context I was diagnosed with mcas by a specialist last year. My mcas meant that I missed three years of school and had doctors telling my mum that I was just stressed and she was overprotective. However I must say that my symptoms are not paticularly bad and seem to be just like allergic reactions apart from the odd day of constant throwing up that seems to be garenteed to happen once a year for some reason, which is obviously very tiring but they have never felt life threatening and I’ve never had to go to the urgent hospital for them. I was also only recommended supplements without any specific medication, (I also don’t take the supplements because they are expensive and I forget). And I guess I have a lot of questions that stress me out.  

Should I be taking medication? I obviously would like my symptoms to be reduced but I have managed to find a way to live around my symptoms to the point where I now live a mostly regular life like I was when I was younger. But is medication worth persuing? 

Also I get really stressed about my health because I always feel like I have ten different conditions and im scared im missing important symptoms because I brush them of as mcas so ig im asking how am I supposed to know if the symptoms are worth going to the doctor for. I have told myself that if the symptoms come and go in waves then its mcas but I always am scared in the back of my mind thats its a life threatening disease or something. I do overthink and stress a lot which definitely does not help but it is a worry for me 

Also im scared that im missing symptoms all together because i dont know they are symptoms. This really sounds silly but it’s a real fear. Mcas really became a problem when i was like ten which means that I don’t really remember specific stuff from when before mcas became a problem. This means I had symptoms that I didn’t know everyone didn’t have. For example I get really bad hot or cold spurts and when I’m cold I get really itchy which now I have learnt is caused by mcas but for my whole life I thought that everyone was experiencing this. Ig my question is how do I identify what symptoms are just bodily functions that everyone has or if it is caused by mcas. 

Also I am worried that this condition will become worse and possibly kill me. So far it has never gotten exponentially worse for no reason and to the point where I can’t control it (it gets worse sometimes but is mostly manageable and is heavily linked to my environment eg gets worse during exam periods). Does it get a lot worse? 

Also I managed to bring my life back in track and I’m currently on a gap year and have been able to go travelling with my friends but the next big step is university which I have a confirmed place in a solid university but unis definitely have a reputation of causing people without mcas to be ill all the time so is mcas going to cause me to have a really bad time because I’m always gonna be sick? Also I have cut out all coffee and alcohol from my life because they cause me to have bad reactions (I never really drank them because even when I was younger I realised that both those things made me feel ill) but will mcas mean that I won’t be able to have the “university experience” because it’s gonna cause me to be very ill

Sorry this post is all over the place and very long I just wanted to get my thoughts down. Any answers would seriously help and hopefully soothe my anxiety. My diagnosis answered a lot of questions but made me ask more questions. ",2,1766368177.0,MCAS,3,0.75,False

I shut off the faucet, dried my hands, briefly adjusted my tie in the mirror, and when I looked down, shit, there it was: a rolled-up square of loose-leaf paper, propped against the side of the drain, held tightly together by what appeared to be a strand of thin black thread or yarn. I pinched the end and dropped it in my palm. Dry as dust. Not an ounce of moisture on the damn thing. 

It didn't make much sense.

“Very funny...” I muttered, chuckling. The words simply reverberated around the empty men’s room.

I twisted my neck side to side - nobody.

I peeked under each stall, figuring I’d catch Tim squatting on a toilet, suppressing a wolfish giggle, but found no one.

It was a strange prank, undeniably, but that wouldn’t exactly be out of the norm at *Happy Harlot Advertising.* 

*They must have lobbed it into the basin when I was distracted...* \- I thought.

Did that explanation make sense? No, not at all. I mean, if that was the case, why didn’t I hear the hinges of the bathroom door creaking? Why didn’t I catch a glimpse of someone in the mirror? Or, better yet, a glimpse of the note flying through the air? 

But I ignored those nagging questions and tugged at the thread.

The note unfurled. I dragged my fingers across the paper. Whoever wrote it did so with force; so much force that they created tiny indents in the looseleaf.   

In jagged blue letters, it read: 

*“HE IS TRYING TO STEAL WHAT IS YOURS”* 

“Who? Tim?” I whispered.

My heart began to gallop. My thoughts grew feverish, imagining myself being fired for what felt like the millionth time. Visions of being replaced by Tim, a younger, smarter, more passionate version of myself: the inevitable upgrade. Pressure built along my skin. Hostile gravity threatened to crush me like a soda can disappearing under the wheel of a steamroller. 

I crumpled the note into a ball before it could do the same to me and launched it into a trash can. 

The thread, however, was harder to dispose of. Not only did it feel nice running between my fingertips, but, strangely, it made me feel safer in a way that's difficult to put to words. Same sort of safety you'd feel carrying around a lucky charm, I guess. I felt protected.

And as long as I ignored one final question, that sense of protection would remain firm.

*Why does this feel like hair...?*

I pocketed the strands and jogged out of the bathroom.

An hour later, Fox called my team to the boardroom for Tim’s presentation. I suffered through it with a pit in my stomach like I’d swallowed a cannonball.

“Right, sure - then why the hell were you late?!” 

She swung around from her wardrobe and bellowed:

“Because we have a deadline, for Christ’s sake! I’ve told you this! I’ve told you this so - many - goddamn - times!” The screech of the closing zipper punctuated her appeal. She launched the bag out into the hallway and stomped past me. 

I paused the interrogation.

My consciousness felt divided, waging war with itself, each half intent on tearing the other limb from limb. Unequivocally, my body believed her. My marrow was on fire, screaming that I was making a mistake. My mind, however, would not yield. No plea would be enough. No evidence would be satisfactory. She was too perfect to have settled for me. Something had to be amiss. 

From behind me, I heard:

“Where the fuck is the Kindle charger, Pete?” Arden ripped open my nightstand’s bottom drawer. Normally, it required a key, but it was an old piece of furniture. In her rage, she’d pulled on the handle with enough force to break the aging lock altogether.

My righteous indignation evaporated. Waves of icy panic surged down my spine. 

She was looming over the drawer, rendered motionless by its contents. 

I kept the tufts of hair on one side and the notes on the other.

By that point, the drawer was nearly full. 

A bevy of useless half-words lurched over my tongue, none of which provided even a semblance of an explanation.

Eventually, I mustered something like: 

“I’ve been receiving...messages.” 

The only thing she said in response was: 

“But...this is your handwriting, Pete.” 

Arden slung the duffel bag over her shoulder and practically sprinted from our home. The front door slammed shut, and I was still in our bedroom. 

I was used to feeling relief after confronting people with what Rattle divulged to me, but that time was different. At that moment, alone in an empty house, I did not experience relief. 

I just felt hollow. 

The minutes that followed are a bit of a blur. 

I don’t think I passed out. Not fully, at least. I floated above my own body, but I couldn’t really see anything. Just shapes lumbering through a thick, blinding mist. I resigned myself. Embraced the detachment. I didn’t feel worth the trouble of it all: letting Rattle protect me was much, much easier. 

Then, it hit me. 

*What’s the point of protecting myself if I don’t think there’s anything worth protecting?* 

The paranoia untangled. The mist cleared. Painful remorse fell over me like a landslide. 

I peered down. 

I was in front of the sink. 

But the drain was triple the size it should’ve been. It nearly covered the whole basin. Thick globs of ash-colored fluid glistened around the quivering metal rim. Hundreds of thin, pearly needles lined the yawning cavity, jutting out from a material that had the color and consistency of velvet: crimson, plush, smooth.  

Rattle’s lips,

and Rattle’s mouth,

and Rattle’s teeth, 

and my right arm was elbow deep within the maw.

I attempted to yank myself out, but Rattle was too quick. 

The drain snapped shut, narrowing the exact diameter of my arm in the blink of an eye.

I screamed. 

Feebly tried to pull it out again, to no avail. 

Then, movement: 

The mouth began twisting. 

\- - - - -

The doctor was very interested in hearing how I managed to flay the majority of my right arm in such a spectacular fashion.  

Lying in the hospital bed, my stump wrapped in gauze, I informed her I’d be more than happy to explain, but she needed to answer one question for me first. The young woman nodded. 

I leaned forward and whispered:

“Behind me, in the wall, do you hear that?” 

The doctor let loose a nervous chuckle and assured me that sound was simply due to noisy plumbing. Initially, her response left me crestfallen, but then, without prompting, she added:

“I will say the noises in your particular room are a little...strange. Shrill. Scratchy… ”

“Almost like grinding metal?” 

She nodded again. I breathed a long, heavy sigh of relief. Best I figured, if she could hear it too - the fidget ring spinning inside the pipes in the walls - that meant I wasn't insane.

It also meant Rattle was still following me.

“Why do you ask? What do you think it is?” 

I laid back, flipped away from her, dragged the blanket over my head, and shut my eyes tight.

1psn7fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1psn7fs/the_thing_in_the_pipes_wont_just_leave_me_alone/,The thing in the pipes won't just leave me alone.,"The first note - just like the hundreds of notes that would follow it - was *completely* dry.

I shut off the faucet, dried my hands, briefly adjusted my tie in the mirror, and when I looked down, shit, there it was: a rolled-up square of loose-leaf paper, propped against the side of the drain, held tightly together by what appeared to be a strand of thin black thread or yarn. I pinched the end and dropped it in my palm. Dry as dust. Not an ounce of moisture on the damn thing. 

It didn't make much sense.

“Very funny...” I muttered, chuckling. The words simply reverberated around the empty men’s room.

I twisted my neck side to side - nobody.

I peeked under each stall, figuring I’d catch Tim squatting on a toilet, suppressing a wolfish giggle, but found no one.

It was a strange prank, undeniably, but that wouldn’t exactly be out of the norm at *Happy Harlot Advertising.* 

*They must have lobbed it into the basin when I was distracted...* \- I thought.

Did that explanation make sense? No, not at all. I mean, if that was the case, why didn’t I hear the hinges of the bathroom door creaking? Why didn’t I catch a glimpse of someone in the mirror? Or, better yet, a glimpse of the note flying through the air? 

But I ignored those nagging questions and tugged at the thread.

The note unfurled. I dragged my fingers across the paper. Whoever wrote it did so with force; so much force that they created tiny indents in the looseleaf.   

In jagged blue letters, it read: 

*“HE IS TRYING TO STEAL WHAT IS YOURS”* 

“Who? Tim?” I whispered.

My heart began to gallop. My thoughts grew feverish, imagining myself being fired for what felt like the millionth time. Visions of being replaced by Tim, a younger, smarter, more passionate version of myself: the inevitable upgrade. Pressure built along my skin. Hostile gravity threatened to crush me like a soda can disappearing under the wheel of a steamroller. 

I crumpled the note into a ball before it could do the same to me and launched it into a trash can. 

The thread, however, was harder to dispose of. Not only did it feel nice running between my fingertips, but, strangely, it made me feel safer in a way that's difficult to put to words. Same sort of safety you'd feel carrying around a lucky charm, I guess. I felt protected.

And as long as I ignored one final question, that sense of protection would remain firm.

*Why does this feel like hair...?*

I pocketed the strands and jogged out of the bathroom.

\- - - - -  

An hour later, Fox called my team to the boardroom for Tim’s presentation. I suffered through it with a pit in my stomach like I’d swallowed a cannonball. 

It was...good. 

No, that’s not true - his presentation was *great*. Genuinely remarkable. His proposal was innovative. His methodology was cost-effective. He sold it all with such zeal, such unshakable confidence. There was fire behind his eyes. 

That was his whole *schtick* \- passion. The man had convictions. He felt everything very deeply. 

*Must be nice.* 

I slumped back in my chair, faking a grin, toying with the hair in my pocket. When that wasn’t providing relief, I swapped to old reliable: my fidget ring. A mobile, spinnable band over a stationary inner band. A tactile outlet for my never-ending worry. 

Afterwards, Fox pulled me into his office and closed the door. 

“So - what’d you think? Pretty stellar work, no?” 

I paced around his office, avoiding eye contact, thumbing the hair in my pocket. Could Tim really be gunning for my position? It wasn’t the first time I had considered the possibility; the man’s a wolf. 

Every man’s a wolf. 

“Uh...Pete?” 

“Hmm?” I stalled my hectic pirouettes, unaware that Fox had sat down behind his desk. He gestured towards a nearby chair. 

I winced; lowering myself into the seat forced my hands out into the open. 

Reluctantly, I let go of the hair, spinning my fidget ring to compensate. A series of grinding *squeaks*emanated from my knuckle. Originally, the fixation was noiseless; time, friction, and inclement weather had rusted the bands to the point of musicality. I prayed the sound wasn’t bothering Fox. 

The CFO’s eyes narrowed. 

“Right! Right. You asked me about Tim's presentation...""

I trailed off, distracted. Jagged letters scribbled in blue ink rocketed to the front of my skull. 

*HE IS TRYING TO STEAL WHAT IS YOURS*

“I’m getting the sense that you have...concerns?” 

I paused.

Then, a lie tumbled from my lips. 

“Well...some of the imagery looked...borrowed.” 

Fox leaned forward. His shoulders tensed. 

“You believe his work was plagiarized?” 

I scratched the back of my head, contemplated the potential ramifications of doubling down for about a quarter of a second, then nodded. 

“Alright then. Thanks for being transparent with me, Pete.” Fox closed his eyes and threw his glasses onto the desk. A sigh billowed from his lips. As I stood up, every inch of my body began to tingle. Liquid stress seeped into my veins. My heart rate violently accelerated. 

*What the fuck did I just do?* 

The rest of the day devolved into a hazy panic. Didn’t get a shred of work done. Instead, I split my energy right down the middle: half went to avoiding Tim, half went to keeping myself from vomiting. When I arrived home a jittery mess, Arden was quick to wrap her slender arms around my aching shoulders.

“Oh, I’m sure they’ll understand,” she said, running a tender hand along my side. When my fiancé got dangerously close to my pocket, I slid my fingers between hers and gently guided her away. 

“You made an honest mistake. Nothing more, nothing less.” 

Sleep evaded me that night.

I tossed and turned, writhing well into the morning hours like a man possessed. Contingencies required planning; I needed to practice how I’d respond in every potential scenario. The lies had to be second nature so I could focus on controlling my body language. 

Much to my horror, I encountered Tim in the parking lot the following morning.

He stomped past me, face flushed the bright red of a bell pepper, twitching, mumbling under his breath as he wrenched his car door open. The man sped away and he never came back. 

Later, I learned that when Fox confronted him about his presentation, he completely flew off the handle. Screamed his innocence loud enough that the damn whole office heard it. Even went so far as to hurl a coffee mug in the CFO’s general direction. It’s unclear whether he *intended* to hit Fox or not. Regardless, he had to duck out of the way to avoided being pelted by it. The mug shattered against the wall, leaving a pile of ceramic shrapnel in its wake.

And that was that. 

Tim was fired on the spot. 

*Passion is as passion does, I guess.* 

At first, I was borderline euphoric with relief. Before long, however, that relief began to sour, and a certain unease trickled back into my skull. 

I was alone in the break room, rinsing flecks of caked-on lasagna from my Tupperware, helplessly lost in another mental labyrinth.

*Yes, objectively, it’s not completely my fault. If Tim had better control over his emotions, he’d likely still be working here. Still, I’m not blameless; I was the catalyst.* 

I only looked away for a moment. 

When I turned back, there it was, propped against the side of the drain, tied at the center by a strand of someone’s hair. 

Note number two. 

I plucked the dry scrap of paper from the basin and began unfurling it. 

*Then again, if he* ***was*** *trying to steal my job, my goddamned livelihood, then maybe a preemptive strike would be justifiable...ethically speaking...*

The hair was blond that time. 

\- - - - -

Over the next week, I decided the thing in the pipes needed a name. It's not that I was talking to Arden about it - God no - it’s more that names make things safe. 

*“Rattle”* seemed as good as any other. 

The more messages I opened, the more I received. The more I received, the more I was able to perceive the thing in the pipes. No matter where I was, I’d hear it: a dull, shaking rattle, like a pool ball clanking around the inside of a washing machine, radiating from the walls, or from the floor, or from deep within the earth. It wasn't continuous. If I heard the noise, that meant a delivery was imminent. 

Was the phenomenon disturbing? Seemingly impossible? Laughably absurd? Check, check, and check. 

But did I care? 

Not in the slightest. 

Rattle was helping me.

I likened them to a guardian angel, vigilant and steadfast, keeping an invisible eye peeled for the leeches and the predators that wished me harm, weeding the wolves from my company. 

I wasn’t *sure* that my sister was dead-set on convincing Mom to cut me out of her will. Granted, I had my suspicions, but I never had the evidence to prove it, not until Rattle came along. It was a similar situation with Calvin. Who would’ve guessed he had been calling me a hack and sell-out behind closed doors? I mean, I sort of did. The moment I left the band to focus on my career, his attitude towards me shifted 180 degrees. Cold, vacant stares. Forced smiles. Never sat next to me at the bar anymore. The changes were subtle, but they were there. I just needed proof, and the thing in the pipes was more than happy to oblige. 

Of course, Rattle wasn’t perfect: the notes often contained small clerical errors. For example, my sister’s name is “Meg”, not “Marge”. And the note about Calvin mentioned him despising me for leaving the “team”, when it should have said the “band”. Wasn’t a problem. In both cases, I knew what they were *intending* to say, and, far as I could tell, Rattle was right about those bastards every time, so what did it matter?

Months flew by.

During that time, Arden started growing distant. Strange glances from her side of the bed before she flicked the light off. Curt, loveless text messages. I feared the worst, but didn’t want to jump to conclusions. 

My fiancé was still at work when I heard a rattling below the floorboards that evening. 

I pushed myself from the couch, plodded into the kitchen, and stood over the kitchen sink. 

*Any second now.* 

There was a faint scent drifting through the air, one I had trouble placing. It was woody, but with a peculiar hint of sweetness. Eucalyptus with a drop of honey. Whatever the scent was, it didn’t raise any red flags. In fact, I found the phantasmal aromatherapy quite relaxing. As I waited, my finger stopped incessantly spinning my fidget ring, and the grinding *squeaks* stopped in turn. Silence blanketed our house. Even the muffled rattling had ceased. 

That silence didn’t last. 

Maybe if I had been paying attention, I would’ve noticed something was desperately wrong. 

*Did Arden really have to “stay late” at work tonight, or is that a cover? An alibi? Is she using again? Cheating on me? Could be both, no reason it couldn’t be -* 

A low, whirring clamor blared through the room. Cold metal cradled my wrist. Artificial wind pushed between my fingers, like the breeze from a fan cranked to its max settings.

My right hand was pressing into the drain. 

The garbage disposal was on. 

I leapt back, ripping my hand out. A searing pain exploded across my middle finger. Cereal boxes and cans of soup clattered against the floor as my shoulders slammed into the pantry shelves. Eventually, the discord settled. Excluding my labored breathing, the house was silent again; the whirring clamor had disappeared. Across the room, the switch for the disposal was in the “off” position. Never turned it on, never turned it off. A warm, slow ooze crawled down my middle finger. The alluring scent had been replaced with the sharp, metallic tang of exposed blood. 

Trembling, I examined my hand. 

A nickel-sized slice of skin had been cleanly excised from above my knuckle. The injury was superficial. No wound to sew back together; just a patch of raw, gushing tissue. I wrapped the finger with paper towels and crept over to the sink. 

A note was resting in the drain. The accompanying hair was silver and brittle. I opened it, surprised to find that there was a second note concealed inside the first. Rattle had never done that before. 

In jagged blue letters, the larger read: 

*ARDIN IS SLEEPING WITH HER BOSS*

In delicate black typography, that second, smaller one read: 

*It’s time, Pete. It’s time to come down here. It’s the only way I can truly protect you.* 

There was a flicker in my chest. A brief rebellion. An honest recognition of the outlandish situation I’d found myself in. Before that ember could bloom, however, it was snuffed out. 

A sweet, woody scent slithered up my nostrils. Eucalyptus and honey. 

My mind began to twist. 

*I can’t believe Arden is cheating on me...*

*- - - - -*

“Admit it! Just admit it!” I screamed. 

My fiancé ignored me. She continued to stumble around our bedroom, throwing handfuls of clothes into an open duffel bag, eyes red and glassy, cheeks coated with a sticky layer of dried tears. 

“There’s nothing to admit, Pete.” 

“Right, sure - then why the hell were you late?!”

now sure, henry could be lying to make holly feel better- but why not just tell her that they were fine in that case? and why would it serve him to make up such a lie in the first place? another explanation could be that he somehow saw into whats happening in the hospital in another way but im unsure as to why or how he could do that.

to me, being a byler believer and a believer in mike being vecnad/ being somehow connected to vecna, it makes sense that vecna can see through mike's eyes or is seeing into his mind. not to mention the coffee he was drinking all throughout the first volume and how cagey he was during the scenes in the hospital.

	•	“17 late nights with way too much coffee”
	•	“3 new features
	•	“1 mistake we’ll never repeat”
	•	busiest month, biggest moment, small fails, etc.

The goal wouldn’t be analytics, but:
	•	storytelling
	•	brand personality
	•	something founders would actually post on LinkedIn or send to customers

	1.	Would you create/share something like this for your business?
	2.	Would it feel valuable, or just gimmicky?

# Update I

Sometimes the most loyal friends are stronger than family. I heard such awful things about The Militia growing up — none of it was true. We might whack some corporate assholes or some company rats, but at least we have morals.

I remember the training outpost. I lived out half my childhood there. They want to make sure The Family has basic education — reading, writing, communication and survival. By grade seven we were learning self-defense, weapons maintenance and combat basics. I remember the boys watching me with envy when I assembled my weapon faster, or took their asses down in training.

By grade nine it was clear I’d be a top student.   
By grade ten we started our first work assignments. 

**Asset Protection Duty**

My first real gig was guarding a water pump. It was siphoned straight out of a corporation’s pipe. Usually they don’t even notice, and if they do, we have connections who tip us off. Sometimes the Company comes anyway and things get messy. But I was lucky.

I met some good people on that post. I didn’t learn much at first. My first real action wasn’t combat — it was desperation.

We try not to get violent, but somebody has to keep order. Besides, we’re not going to kill anyone who doesn’t deserve it.

They broke through the front gate and rushed through the facility door. We didn’t fire. We’re not supposed to shoot the unarmed — especially the weak. We were shocked, young, and inexperienced. I could feel the tension hanging in the air.

“Please—do you have water?” a man yelled. “My wife is dying.”

“What do we say?” Colin whispered.

I took a deep breath.

“We have no water,” I said, keeping my voice flat. “You need to leave. If you don’t, we will use force.”

Everyone looked stunned, even though that’s exactly what we’re trained to say. If we gave them water, they’d come back. They always do.

A low murmur moved through the group of Drys before someone stepped forward.

“Well,” he said, laughing through it, “fucking kill us then.”

The cheering started almost immediately.

The four of us froze. None more than Colin—he didn’t even blink. Everyone knew the procedure. No one wanted to be the first to follow it.

I told the guys to move.

We split through the back doors in teams of two, electric probes in hand. Colin and I took the left. The other two went right. We dropped three quickly, but the fourth lunged—grabbed Colin and pressed a knife to his throat.

We stood there, frozen, unsure.

“You’re sick fucks,” the man said. His voice was raspy. His eyes were bloodshot.

I waited a second too long. I thought I could reason with him.

He did it for no reason.

I pulled the trigger as soon as I understood.

Too late.

Colin dropped. Blood spread across the floor.

I wish I could have saved him.

I held the button down longer than I needed to.

Stopped a second short of cooking him.



# Update II

The image of the life leaving Colin’s eyes stayed with me for months. Eventually, it faded.

I guess you can only hold on to so much trauma. That night—hearing Mom and her boyfriend executed, barely escaping out the back door half-awake and half-dressed—will scar me for the rest of my life. But even that pain dulled with time.

At least I ended up where I did. I’m glad the Family recognizes my worth. The best part is I don’t do the grunt work anymore.

I got my first collar last night. They even threw a little party for me. The leaders were there, and believe it or not, Mr. Branton himself gave it to me. I was shocked by its beauty. I’ve never seen something sparkle like that—a stunning gold and diamond arrangement. Some say our collars are ancient relics from old societies. All I know is mine is pretty as hell.

I put it on and everyone cheered. It felt good.

I deserve to be recognized. I’ve whacked company assholes, trained newbies, and planned more missions than I can count. But my recent score—that’s what finally did it.

Everyone was shocked when I said I wanted to go after toys.

They don’t really understand how much of a scam they are. Most people can’t afford them, and the Company makes obscene money off plastic and branding. I wasn’t stealing from kids — I was cutting into corporate profit.

The best part was the logistics. Huge shipments, usually unguarded.

Still, I was careful. I sent scouts to track schedules and Company security levels. It didn’t take long to see the pattern. Early morning was best — four trucks, no escorts, sitting ready to be confiscated. And just like that, we had a plan.

Twenty of us rolled out in five armored vehicles. The roadblock went perfectly. We took the trucks and drove them back without resistance. I think only one driver got killed.

It’s a shame, really — an innocent worker. I don’t understand why some people are so loyal to their jobs.

We sold the toys at half store price. We still made a good profit and actually helped some kids. The paperwork was a nightmare, though. One night Mr. Branton caught me working late and laughed.

“This is why I prefer hustling water,” he said. “But good pull, kid.”

One of the moms later told me a toy broke into sharp pieces and cut her child’s wrist. The bleeding was hard to stop. I felt bad — but I didn’t make the toys. And let’s be honest, they would’ve bought them anyway.

I told myself I was just cutting out corporate profits.

The other night I was out for dinner with some of the Family. A decent diner. No Drys around.

One of the higher-ups really got into it about the Company. We’d already had a few glasses of potato alcohol and cider, so I can’t remember his exact words.

“I’m telling you,” he said. “They’re stealing people. Harvesting them. All roads lead there. They say they’re cleaning the streets, but it’s so much worse.”

Even though he slurred, he had that dark, truthful look — like a man who’d pulled back a curtain he was never meant to see. He hesitated before continuing.

“It’s torture. It’s all controlled. The water. The credits… Fuck. I think I might buy one of them new Bodens.”

Mercy stopped making sense after that.

The Company is our real target. And I have a plan I think the Family will love.



# Update III

I don’t mean to sound cocky, but everyone knows there’s no one better than me with a knife. That’s why my newest plan worked so damn well. We used stealth — something mostly unknown to the brute-force Family.

Usually three of us would sneak up on a cleaning crew. I’d take one or two out with my knife, and if needed the others would rifle down the rest. We’d take their gear — guns, probes — then drive their corpse-disposal vehicles back to our facility. Mr. Branton said the bodies and trucks would be dealt with properly.

We ran that play a lot. I’ve probably killed fifteen or twenty of those bastards and saved hundreds of bodies from whatever sick, twisted shit they do to them.

We can’t anymore. They’ve added more gunners now, and there’s no point taking losses.

So that play is over. But I’m pretty sure the Family noticed its success. Trucks disappeared fast. Bodies buried or burned. Vehicles sold, melted down — whatever.

“Good job,” Branton said. “But we should shift our focus back to water.”

I hesitated as he stared right at me. Then I met his eyes.

“I get that you want profit,” I said, “but we need to make the Company pay.”

He smiled — clearly intrigued — and told me to follow him. We went to the leisure room, poured ourselves coffee, and sat down. We’d barely finished half our cups and he was still smirking.

“You know if we steal enough water,” he said, “they’ll come for us.”

“Okay?” I said.

“So when we pull out of a pump station,” he continued, smiling, “stay behind and whack a few like you always do.”  
 He leaned back. “I might take one out myself if I’m feeling good that day.”

“Uh… okay,” I said, staring into my coffee.

Either he wants me dead, or he’s a psychopath. Maybe both. I don’t know. But something about him feels off.

The rest of the Family — my brothers and sisters — we’d die for each other.



# Update IV

I always knew Branton smelled like shit — I just never put it together.  
I don’t know how naïve he thinks I am. I had all the same access he did. Anything I didn’t, I found. I had his password.

The transfers were coming from *Red Company*. Clear as day.  
Whatever he was doing, he was a piece of shit.

So I did the smart thing anyone would do. I pretended not to notice and found a bag big enough to pack.

The next morning I came in early with a burlap sack.  
 Explosives. Machine guns. Knives. Ammunition. Everything I could carry.

A few people saw me heading for the door. No one stopped me.  
 I left and never went back.

The next day I had two goals:  
 put up a couple *Gun for Hire* posters,  
 and take out the trash.

Heart pounding, I climbed six flights of stairs and set up.  
I watched the clock.

**2:55 PM**

By **3:10**, he stepped outside for his usual smoke.

For a second it felt like he was looking straight at me.  
I froze — then realized I was being stupid.

I lined up the shot.

It was one of the easiest I’ve ever taken.  
No resistance on the trigger.

A soft mist. His eyes rolled back.

That was it.

(Im 26, I think she’s 24) I just said we should grab coffee and go on a walk for an idea. She replied really quick, said we could figure something out, and asked where I lived. I replied, asked her the same. She replies a city 15-20 mins away, so I’m thinking “great, we have something that could work.” I asked if she was from here/the area because we’ve never spoken before, so for all I knew, she could’ve been from somewhere far away (and it be a cool conversation point)

Then, silence. The message said “sent” for 12 days, then suddenly she opened it yesterday. I just noticed on Instagram that the sent had disappeared, so I clicked on it, and it said “seen 8 hrs ago.” So we went from a few texts back and forth to 4 texts later being left for 12 days. At first I figured maybe she deleted it or turned off the read notification but that ended up not being the case.  

Obviously I got ghosted, I’m not denying that. I’m just curious why though. I didn’t say anything weird or wrong because all the texts I sent were ones I put in this story.

I remember telling him as a child that if he wanted, I could learn to make coffee so we could drink it together at home, but he simply preferred to go out.

When he divorced my mother, before a judge decided which days I should spend with each of them, he didn't even bother to call me. He harassed my mother for years because she didn't want to stay married to a man who did nothing.

When I spent 15 days with him in the summer, I would return to my mother's house after 7 days, crying because my grandmother was psychologically abusing me, and he did nothing, always on the sofa or out of the house as usual.

One day, when I was 13, I had enough of my grandmother crossing the line and I left home (he sided with my grandmother). Since then, I've been living with my mother. All year, he only wrote to wish me a happy birthday: no gifts, no snacks, nothing.

He recently wrote wanting to see me again, but I'm 18 now and I rejected his idea, telling him that if he hadn't acted like a father until now, he didn't need to anymore.

He earns €3,000 a month, which is a lot in Spain, and some months she barely pays child support.

I won’t sugar coat it - finishing DIY’ing stuff the 2 weeks leading up to the wedding was STRESSFUL. I wish I could have eliminated some of that stress for me, my husband, and my parents. Little things like doing the welcome bags ourselves, the seating chart, the paper goods  (I love designing, but I underestimated the difficulty of printing and learned printing yourself is not worth the hassle and to pay a professional), making emergency bridal suite kits (mostly unnecessary in hindsight!), packing everything up and organizing it to make sure the right people would have it at the right times, etc etc. was all more stressful and time-consuming than anticipated. I’m assuming those are all things that a full service planner probably handles! However, it was also kind of fun and funny bonding between me, my husband, my parents, and my brother - so if you have the right people, you can make the most of anything! I consider myself VERY lucky here, I know not everyone has that type of support, so I deeply cherish the ability to be stressed but also laughing about it with my loved ones.

All that said about the stress leading up to it - I LOVED our wedding weekend and wouldn’t change a thing. It was our dream weekend. It was so us, and it was so fun!

Here’s an overview of the weekend:

Thursday night we did an un-official kickoff at Pebble Beach just for the folks who came in early. We watched the bagpipes and sunset at the outside area of Roy's (I think, idk I'm not a golf person but my husband is and he planned this night). People ordered food and drink at the bar (we didn't have to make any sort of reservation/pay any fee, but we did do one tab bc it was easiest for the group, and we picked up the tab here). Honestly so fun and chill and a perfect way to kick things off.

Friday morning at 10am we did a ‘Welcome Hike’. This is now maybe one of my favorite memories ever in my life. It was crazy getting to stroll along the coast with \~50 of my friends and family, ranging from childhood friends to aunts and uncles. Make wedding welcome hikes a thing!!! Also - IT WAS FREE! We then went further into Big Sur for a casual lunch at Cafe Kevah (order at the bar, folks paid for themselves). We then went and did our rehearsal at our venue.

Friday night 5-7pm we did our rehearsal dinner at a local Monterey restaurant - we worked with the owner to do a pretty affordable family style menu. We had SO MUCH food and everyone loved it (tbh I was still kind of stressed at this point about logistics, so I didn’t get to enjoy it as much as I wish I could have - shoutout anxiety!)

Friday night 7-9pm we did the official ‘Welcome Drinks’ at our hotel. A huuuge thing that was super helpful to the budget was that the hotel let us use our event deposit as our room block deposit. Some hotels wanted us to pay for every room in the block and not get the money back until after the wedding. Personally, we did not have an extra \~$25k floating around to have tied up in a room block until after the wedding. So this worked out perfectly. The hotel was gorgeous and exactly what I wanted - having all our loved ones “under one roof”. (I say that bc our first planner who we fired was not listening to me about that mattering, and told me the only solution to not paying a huge room block deposit was to let people fend for themselves and book at any of the local small boutique inns in the area. I’m sure that’s fine for some people, but NOT what I wanted. I wanted everyone to be in the same place and to provide a reasonable hotel room rate to all of my loved ones who were traveling very far to show up for me. We got our rate at $359/night which I thought was SO reasonable for the area).

Saturday - Wedding Day - a PERFECT DAY, honestly! The girls got ready in our hotel suite - just hair and makeup there (while the boys went on a run and brunch). The bridal party then took a bus down to our venue \~50 min drive from hotel to venue. We got dressed at the venue, and then it was off to the races! General rundown of the wedding: 

* After getting ready we took photos at the venue
* Guests were bused down and greeted with champagne/NA beverages (I was worried about them having a long bus ride from hotel to venue and being annoyed about it, so I wanted to make sure they felt taken care of upon arrival - def worth the splurge).
* Then we had a very love-filled, true tear-jerker of a ceremony officiated by a family member! 
* Then cocktail hour with acoustic guitar + singing duo. Amazing farm-to-table appetizers and a grazing bar. Locally-sourced ingredients for our cocktails (one of my friends’ husbands told me it was the best margarita he’d ever had in his life!). And an oyster bar - my groom is a sober king and he wanted something that felt \~fancy and elegant\~ to cheers with his friends! The oysters were perfect for that and worth the splurge. 
* Then dinner and speeches. Also farm-to-table dinner. The only hiccup here is that our venue doesn’t have a kitchen, and I really wanted plated meals rather than a buffet. Our caterer warned us it would be tough for everything to come out hot, and they were not wrong. I don’t think there was any avoiding this  given our logistical situation. Personally, I’ll take slightly chilly food over people having to walk around carrying their plates while wearing fancy dresses, heels, and suits. 🤷 
* After dinner we did the first dance, mother/son dance, father/daughter dance, then opened the dance floor for the rest of the night!!! The acoustic duo who did the ceremony and cocktail hour also DJ’d! They also emcee'd all night.
* During the dancing, we had a coffee/espresso bar set up and had ice cream with it to serve affogatos (shout out to my husband for that idea and for his groomsmen getting the ice cream and putting it in a cooler and transporting it!)
* Venue ended at 10pm (noise ordinances) so we went down the street to a local bar for our after party where we did a cash bar, but we provided pizza and had a private section (room + patio) of the bar!
* Then we bussed everyone back to the hotel around midnight!

Sunday to end the weekend we did coffee and bagels on the promenade of the hotel

**My biggest cost-saving hack!** 

Find lesser-known, newer vendors. They want to show up and do THE BEST JOB they can because they’re still building their businesses up. I’m sure this could be nerve-wracking for brides and could cause things to go wrong... But honestly, we didn’t have anything go wrong with our newer vendors! It did take a lot of research and legwork on my end. Those amazing ""quality for the cost"" type vendors included: 

* Florals for $5,800 - okay my girl SHOWED UP AND SHOWED OUT. (This was another thing the fired planner told me wasn’t possible lol. He said I wouldn’t be able to get anyone to do around $5k in the area.) I SCOURED the internet and found someone who had recently relocated her floral business from San Diego to Central California. I legit feel like our florals looked like they were worth $15k+++. She seriously hit it out of the park. Angie Chiuzzi at Flor De Mar if anyone is looking for someone in the area. HIGHLY recommend. She also gave me a gift on our wedding day, which was so sweet! Just absolutely incredible experience. 
* Catering for $14k. Another one that our fired planner flubbed lol. (He promised he had a caterer at a great price point for us when we booked him as our planner 1.5 years before the wedding, and then two weeks after booking the planner we were like great let’s get your caterer friend booked for our date and suddenly he was unavailable…… Very odd and annoying. He kept recommending too cheap (like right price point but cheap in quality/vibes) or too expensive caterers.) I again SCOURED the internet and found a couple who lived on a farm, grew their own food, and had just started catering weddings. Again, the NICEST people in the world. Such great service for a GREAT price point in the area. The food, appetizers especially, were amazing. It felt like we got $25k+ worth of food in terms of quality and quantity and the service. They also did our cake! 
* Music for $2700 - now remembering that the fired planner laughed at me when I told him I found someone who would do both live music and DJ and said they’d do it for $2500 if we paid them in cash!! Seriously what the hell, planner! We added on them learning our first dance song to play it live - we took kind of a while to pick our song, and I think only gave them like 1.5 months heads up so they were a little concerned they couldn’t learn it in time, but ultimately they did and it was great. Just flagging that to procrastinators - maybe pick your first song sooner than us if someone needs to learn it lol. They also did all of the audio set up + equipment for the day, emcee’d throughout the night, and brought a fun extra disco ball type light for the dancefloor. We found them through a local facebook group where a woman was like I used them for my birthday and they’re incredible. Again, a HUGE steal for the price I felt like.

And just FYI - the planner we fired was Golden Coast Planning. If you’re in the Carmel/Monterey area - avoid them. There’s another reddit post about them in SF Wedding Planning that’s a few months old, and we had the exact same experience as that couple. Took a long time to respond, disorganized (I had to correct multiple times what our wedding date was with them!), did not really seem to care about my vision, etc. GCP has 5 stars everywhere, so it’s good to keep in mind that vendors can doctor their reviews. We had booked them for partial planning and I think the only thing they really did was secure our buses and recommend vendors that didn’t work for my vision/budget. Awesome! In retrospect, $6500 for a partial planning package was too much, especially considering how little they were doing. Wish I could have spent that money elsewhere.

There’s so many things I’m sure I’m leaving out (like how I wore my mom’s dress from 1990 and we did a light re-design of it and that was THE BEST experience; or how my husband did a custom suit with a guy he met through work; how honestly I had to do therapy around my issues with money+guilt around spending and how  I'd recommend that for women dealing with similar things around such a big life event, how I asked for all the camcorder footage to edit my own documentary style film of the day, etc etc etc!) But this is already too long, so happy wedding planning brides - I hope you have the best day AND the best marriage! Six months into marriage, and I’m so grateful to be married to my husband!

Shortly after drinking 6 oz of it, I developed flu-like symptoms and severe stomach pain that's lasted over 12 hours now. I had a slight fever and chills for about 4 hours. 

I am shocked that there isn't a warning on this coffee. I have no autoimmune, no known allergies, and was not sick previously. I hardly ever get sick in general. My stomach hasn't hurt this bad since I got food poisoning when I was 9.

My husband consumed about 12 oz and developed a headache with no stomach pain.

I definitely won't consume the coffee again. There should be a warning label.",3,1766367156.0,LionsManeRecovery,1,1.0,False

what helped (this is gonna sound dumb):

started going to this coffee shop every morning for like 3 weeks. same one. just forced myself to say ""thanks"" to the barista and make eye contact. that's it at first.

week 2 I added ""how's your day going?"" felt awkward as fuck but I kept doing it.

by week 3 the barista started conversations with me first. sounds small but it like broke something in my brain. realized people aren't analyzing everything I say.

then I tried it at my gym. small talk with the front desk person. then random people between sets. gradually got less weird about it.

now I can actually have conversations at parties without wanting to die. still not perfect but way better than 6 months ago.

idk if this helps anyone but that gradual exposure thing really worked for me. don't try to go from 0 to 100 overnight, that's where I kept failing before.

btw I wrote down the full 30-day progression. it's in my profile. If you want take a look at it just trying to help everyone out.

anyway yeah. hope someone finds this useful.",3,1766366828.0,selfimprovementday,0,1.0,False
1psmsa5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FTMOver30/comments/1psmsa5/generational_divides_in_the_community/,Generational divides in the community,"I've just been thinking about this a lot today.

In another sub, a post was made by a trans man describing how he had been verbally clocked in front of a room of people by his younger queer client. I'm not going to share the post bc idk if it violates the rules, plus the comments are getting very messy and I don't want to drag that over here. I've also just heard unpleasant things about the subreddit it was posted in anyway. Iykyk.

But it's made me consciously realize that I've been experiencing this generational divide at my own job. I work at a coffee shop and as you can imagine, most of my coworkers at any given time are queer. I enjoy it for the most part, but some of my worst interactions have been with young queer people.

One of them kept commenting on my voice because at the time, it was still dropping (I pass completely now by voice alone). They did this within earshot of other coworkers who would also look weirded out by it. I told them to stop, and when they didn't I got pissed off. They then acted like a victim and implied that I'm transphobic for not 100% loving having aspects of my transness commented on.

Another person around the same age would talk to me in a baby-like voice after they found out that I was trans. I have no clue what that was about to be honest but it wasn't pleasant.

There have been other less intense instances of younger trans people interacting with me that have made me uncomfortable. The one that didn't make me uncomfortable was the most recent - he commented on a rainbow pin I was wearing and we started talking. At this point I do typically pass except to the occasional fellow trans person, mostly due to my height and the way I interact with them I think (bc we all know how cis people tend to respond if they clock someone, even if their response isn't negative).

I disclosed that I'm trans to him and he eagerly invited me to a local transmasc group. I ended up looking it up and deciding against it at the time, bc it looked like it was run by and aimed towards much younger trans people. And I didn't want to put myself in a situation of people triggering my dysphoria, or asking too much of me for being an older trans person (which I have also had happen, and it's extra weird bc I'm only 29).

Maybe I'm looking too much into things. But so far at least it seems kind of like younger generations - at least in my area - don't carry as much of a sense of danger or discomfort around transness. Which is honestly very surprising to me because I do live in a transphobic red state, and I have experienced my share of discrimination. Although within the immediate blue bubble I live in, there has been less overt hatred than in the general state.

I do want to get involved with the community but it seems like all of the older trans man here have gone full stealth for safety, or moved away. I don't blame them; the only reason I haven't is bc I am already pretty well known as being trans in the local gay community, despite passing now. So the only other trans people I've been able to meet really are younger, or trans women (and I do love meeting my trans sisters, don't get me wrong, but our experiences do have differences that sometimes we struggle to understand). I have met one other younger binary trans man whose goal was being stealth, but he distanced himself from me and didn't seem to want to associate himself with any other trans people (I assume he may have had bad interactions that made him decide to do this).

On one hand, it feels good to see younger people feel more comfortable being visibly queer or trans. But that doesn't change the fact that there is intense discrimination happening everywhere right now, and dragging trans people into situations that out them or emphasizes their transness puts them in danger. And of course, dysphoria.

In the OG post I referenced, this has turned into a debate about nonbinary people and you can imagine how that's going. But this kind of thing imo really does seem to just be a generational thing among younger queer and trans people, in my experience. Has anyone else experienced this from younger queer people?",36,1766366814.0,FTMOver30,19,0.97,False
