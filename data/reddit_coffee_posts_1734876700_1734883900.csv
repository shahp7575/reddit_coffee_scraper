1hk18vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hk18vb/buying_advice_needed_linea_micra_vs_lelit_bianca/,"Buying advice needed - Linea Micra vs Lelit Bianca V3 or something else? [¬£3,000]","First time reddit post, I've been reading posts for a while and stuck for my next espresso machine so decided to create an account and ask below: Long post ahead...

About me, early 20's, I do still live at home, maybe won't make the purchase until I buy a house (maybe silly having an expensive coffee machine if still living at home?) ((Looking to move out in 18 months or so)). I've currently got the delonghi la specialista arte, however have just upgraded the grinder and bought a DF54. Got this last month and enjoying it so far.  
I got into coffee in 2023 and then towards the end of the year saw some POV Coffee Shop videos and was hooked, so I bought the Delonghi as my first machine for home. Entirely self taught (as I guess most people at home are, through YouTube videos) I'm really enjoying learning about coffee, I never drank it until 18/20 months ago. I live in a relatively small town with not many (good) coffee shops around me except Costa / Starbucks. I can't remember the last time I bought a coffee away from Home. I do also work from home 95% of the month so would get good use out of any machine (although no one else at home drinks coffee, so would only be doing one cup at a time).

I've really enjoyed making coffee's over the past 16 months but now ready to take it to the next level. I drink an americano or two every morning, and 9 times out of 10 a flat white or two in the afternoon. The DF54 has been great so far, I'm fairly new to all of this so saw that was one of the best grinders for not too much money. However, since getting that, I've looked at other espresso machine's. I've also put a lot of effort into learning how to do latte art too, and it's massively improved recently (again, YouTube videos to help)

Anyway, I was looking online for the next machine to buy, I adore the look of the Rocket Apartmento but then found that there's things such as Heat Exchange and Dual Boilers (forgive my naivety) and read that Dual Boilers are the way forward. I'm honestly happy to pay anything really, I've never seen the Lelit or Micra in person but found online these are some of the best ones out there. I will look in the new year to visit London and view the LM in person, maybe visit somewhere that has the Bianca V3 too and look to do a demo.

Just after some advice, for those that have either machine, do you enjoy them? Am I silly to go from a Delonghi to a Micra? Is it silly to have a pretty expensive espresso machine with a ¬£220 grinder? I could stick with my Delonghi but it takes quite a while to pull a shot, then purge the steam wand, and then steam (first world problem I know)

What I want from my next machine:

\- Heat up time isn't a biggy as I can have a smart plug on it however the Micra is 5-7 minutes which seems perfect. It's not an issue but if I fancy one randomly, it'd be good to switch it on and it be ready a few minutes later.

\- I have 45cm from my worktop to the cabinet above, ideally I'd want to place some cups on top. My americano cup is 8.5 CM high, it might not even fit under the Micra portafilter?

\- No option currently to plumb it in, (have just started to buy Tesco Ashbeck water) for my coffee. Like I say, learning as I go along. Didn't realise how big water was in this all :)

\- Ideally be able to steam milk and pull a shot at the same time (not possible with my Delonghi)

\- Silly to buy either if I've just bought the DF54?¬† Or is the DF54 capable for either machine? I really enjoy single dosing as I alternate between coffee's, sometimes 2-3 different bags a day.

\- Do I just stick with the Delonghi? Go and see both in their shops, maybe have a demo and see further into 2025 what I want to do. Feeling indecisive, hence this post.

\- I know the Bianca V3 has much more ability to do flow control etc but to be honest, I just want a good americano and a flat white. I love fruity americano's, but saw that the Bianca is maybe better for lighter roasts? Although, I'm probably overthinking it. I have also just bought a V60 and enjoying making those along with my Americano/Flat White's.

\- Reason for picking these machines, I don't want to upgrade regularly, happy for my next machine to be the one I have for many many years to come. If I'm spending ¬£2K on a V3, I may as well spend more on the Micra?

\- Following from above, I would want a WDT/distributor that clips to the portfilter and potentially a self-levelling tamper.

\- Also really want a better steam wand than the Delonghi, I really want the best flat white I can do with steaming. I feel my current machine is holding me back (although they're pretty good) and the time to make a drink is quite slow. The delonghi physically can't go faster.

I'm not going to buy a new machine just yet (he says anyway) but I am trying to determine what's best when I do change. Or if neither machine recommended is right, do you have a reccomendation? If you have either machine, please send a photo through. I love the blue or grey Micra with the red letter logo.

I may see both in person and change my mind or just stick with what I've got but thought I'd ask those that definitely know more than me :) Thank you.

After some confusion, I realized that since I‚Äôd already made migrations, my only choices were to refactor my database or delete it and start over. It was extra terrible because I thought I was done with the project, but failing to set up the custom user model properly ended up costing me another four hours of work. It really made me panic and feel like my whole project was doomed. 

Recently I‚Äôve been thinking about what beginners might need to help them learn Django in the smoothest and fastest way possible, and felt that helping them avoid this mistake could be really helpful. So I made a [YT video](https://youtu.be/OIC4ounpQjA?si=FqUsq-x8cuUsJM2n) where I basically beg people to set up a custom user and quickly show them how - as it really just takes seconds.

**Notable characters:** man/owner of the apartment, a child who offers to play with him

**Notable gameplay mechanics:** walking, interacting with objects, dialogues

**Other details:** The main character, a man/woman, enters an apartment. I don't remember why exactly. I clearly remember the furnishings of the room, that is, the apartment. The entrance to the room is from the lower left corner. A little ahead, by the wall, is a closet. In the upper right corner is a refrigerator. A little to the left of the refrigerator is a TV. In the middle of the room is a long couch. To the left of the sofa is a coffee table. In the upper left corner is a hard-to-open door (you can't go in there) and a small table. There is a note on the table. After exploring the room, we hear the steps of the owner/man of this apartment. We can hide in the closet near the entrance, behind the sofa, behind the refrigerator. We need to hide specifically behind the refrigerator. Then we hide behind the sofa. We wait for the owner to watch TV, come to the table with a note and enter the hard-to-open door. Then we leave the apartment. If we hid in other places, the owner finds us and the death screen is shown - a dark room with nothing, the man/owner approaches the main character and breaks his neck. The following moments that I remember: several benches. Behind one bench stood a man who, when interacting with him, will respond to us rudely.

Is there any chance for us?,"I‚Äôm American but moved to France about 2 years ago and met my French boyfriend in Paris. We‚Äôd been dating for the past 9 months and met on a dating app. I felt like he was my Prince Charming from the beginning. Everyone who we met said that we were so in love, so alike, and so our breakup completely blindsided me.  
We had problems starting from a couple months into the relationship. He has a dependency on weed and one day, about 2 months into the relationship, when he was trying to quit, he told me that he didn‚Äôt know if he had feelings for me and we went through a day of being together, not knowing whether to stay or go. Another issue had been that he is Jewish and I am not, and he had another moment where he got up in the middle of the night and told me he was concerned about our relationship because he saw himself marrying a Jewish wife. At the end of the conversation I had calmed him down a bit and he ended up telling me he loved me.¬†

I have always had problems with anxious attachment. I had never been able to keep a long relationship and so having gone this far and been this serious (I met his friends and his family, went on vacations with him) was a real success with him. I was very happy with him, but in retrospect, I‚Äôm not sure I always showed this happiness. There would be times when I behaved very badly and was clingy (I cried when he left my place to go see his friends after hanging out all day with me, told him I was scared he would break up with me over my anxiety and depression because one of my ex‚Äôs had). I always apologized after these instances, and he seemed accepting. I could be jealous of him however, as he is from Paris and I‚Äôm not, him having a wide circle of friends and family from childhood and mine being an ocean away. As this was my first real relationship, I felt it was ok to lose myself completely in the relationship for a time. I still had some friends, a stable job, but not as much of a social life as he had. However, there was one time where I told him I needed to make new friends and he told me ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to you have me‚Äù. I also told him that I felt bad being clingy towards him and he told me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre allowed‚Äù. I then of course proceeded to break down in tears as he held me.

However, I could tell the past couple of weeks before the breakup things had been off and on. He could seem slightly annoyed, but I decided not to take it personally. The last time I told him something negatively about myself 2 days before we went on a break (that I felt fat) he responded super lovingly and kindly (‚Äúyou‚Äôre not fat, you‚Äôre the most beautiful girl in the world, you‚Äôre perfect‚Äù). He had also been quite insecure, telling me a couple weeks ago he couldn‚Äôt stop comparing himself to his other friend who is more outgoing than he is. I told him that it‚Äôs natural to compare in life but it‚Äôs not fair to him and that he‚Äôs perfect the way he is. He told me he was so lucky to have me. I felt there was somewhat of an even give and take at this point.

The night before we decided to take a break he came over to my place, we watched a movie and smoked weed as usual and I asked him if he wanted to have dinner with my friends on Sunday (he told me yes, if he didn‚Äôt have any other plans). The next morning he woke up, took a shower, and told me he was going to his grandmas. I asked him if he was ok as he seemed down, and he said that he didn‚Äôt think our relationship was working anymore. I asked him why and he told me it‚Äôs hard to be with someone who doesn‚Äôt like themselves and that he‚Äôs at a point where he feels really confident in himself. I asked him what the exact problems were and he said he couldn‚Äôt tell me what the problems were because he thought I would just wanna hear bad things about myself. He also said he doesn‚Äôt feel like we‚Äôre meant to be together, that when we have silence it‚Äôs awkward and that our communication is bad, and that he felt like the relationship was just based off of me needing him. I was shocked and told him so, and then told him that maybe we needed to take a break because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to talk about these things in a heightened state. He said he needed a couple of days.¬†

A week goes by of complete agony, and I text him to meet up, he told me that he wanted to meet up as well. We got coffee and talked for hours. He told me he felt very guilty about our previous conversation, and was just searching in his head explanations to give me as to why he didn‚Äôt feel the same anymore when really, it was just an intuitive feeling he had that we were not supposed to be together that he had felt on and off throughout the relationship. He said that the days after we had a break he felt like he made a huge mistake, but eventually settled into his decision. We talked for hours, going to a cafe, going to his apartment and talking and cuddling and smoking. This was the most confusing moment in the breakup, as he said he still wanted to hug me and kiss me but that he couldn‚Äôt because it wasn‚Äôt fair to my emotions. After taking a long time to decide whether to stay or go, he eventually walked me home. All throughout this time we alternated between talking seriously about the problems, with him saying some harsh things (comparing his relationship with me to his friends and saying he loved me less than his friends loved their girlfriend, telling me perhaps I projected too far into the future with him), and making jokes and talking about cute memories we had. He also still called me baby, still said that he loved me and would always have a special place for me in my heart. Most of the time throughout this talk I was crying very hard. I told him I wouldn‚Äôt try to convince him to make him stay, but I also asked him why he didn‚Äôt address our problems during the relationship. He told me that even if we had tried to address the issues, he‚Äôs not sure if they would‚Äôve gone away. When he walked me back to my place he told me that he‚Äôd always be there for me if I ever needed anything, and then asked me if I wanted him to take me to the airport next week when I came home to the US for Christmas. I said yes but then after declined over text, telling him I think it‚Äôs better if we have some space. He said he wanted to be friends in the future. Then I asked him to kiss me and he did, and told me he‚Äôd always be in my life and that he loves me.

I‚Äôm still having a hard time wrapping my brain around the whirlwind and figuring out where/how we went so wrong when I was so in love. I still love him and still want to be with him but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs viable. I‚Äôm now (as I said previously) giving him some space so we can both calm down and recover, but going through the relationship and looking at our problems is agonizing. I know this is kind of a complicated and bizarre situation, but if anyone has any advice please let me know. I‚Äôd be happy to clarify too if it‚Äôs a confusing story.",1,1734882658.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I manually stopped it, but it would have gone on even longer. Usually I do 18g, but have previously found that 16g for these beans give the best extraction and fits the best in my basket. They are the Dark and Cozy beans from Lineage coffee in Orlando, FL. As the name suggests, they are pretty dark. They were roasted about 10 days ago. 

This long and fast extraction was never the case before. I usually get a good 1:2 ratio pull in a good amount of time. I thought that maybe I accidentally made a customized shot volume that was really big somehow, but I tried factory resetting it by pressing the 1 and 2 cup buttons and nothing happened. 

Is this a grind issue? Machine issue? Skill issue? I‚Äôve had the machine for over 6 months and this has never happened, even when I was just starting out. I already made the grind finer than usual, but do I keep going?

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I‚Äôm not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I‚Äôm not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interest you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

1hk0unz,https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/1hk0unz/tw_tak_berharap_pun_belum_tentu_tidak_kecewa/,[TW] Tak berharap pun belum tentu tidak kecewa.,"W menghadiri suatu acara barusan, get together. Agenda utamanya itu gift giving, dan setelah kepikiran di jalan pulang, it triggered an old trauma.

Waktu gue masih sekolahan pernah ada semacam gift giving: semua anak membawa makanan untuk saling tukar menukar makanan, dengan spirit kebersamaan. Ortu w ya masak yg enak, mikir semua ortu lain akan masak yg enak. Gua bawa nasi goreng telor dua porsinya jumbo. Pas di kelas prosesi tukar menukar di mulai, kelas gua genap, jadi ada perpasangan per absen. Gua lihat pas tmn2 w nuker, pada dapat yg enak2, ada yg bawa rawon, pecel ayam, yg gue inget dua itu. Pas giliran gue, gue terdiam,

Gue cuman dapet kacang (bandung atau pilus gitu w lupa) 2 plastik sedang. Udh melempem lagi.

Gua diketawain sekelas, entah itu they laughing with me or on me. Mau nangis malu, takut gak dibilang bersyukur, mau marah dah didiemin guru ‚Äúhayo harus ikhlas‚Äù.

My tummy hurts. Pagi w gak sarapan, gara2 ortu nyiapin tu nasi goreng, siang w cuman makan kacang melempem. Perut w sakit, hati gua lebih sakit lagi.

Today its repeated again. Cuman lebih ‚Äúmewah‚Äù aja. Ketemu dengan komunitas, niatnya kenalan. Gift giving juga. W bawa buku.

Gue dari awal gak berharap banyak, lagian sama strangers juga, nothing to lose. Niatnya cuman ketemu, make friends, hang out, done. Dapet barang bagus ya alhamdulillah. Kurang bagus ya gapapa.

So far ketemu ya oke2 aja, yg hadir terkesan dah kenal lama. Ngomongnya akrab. Vibesnya oke. Pas gift giving gua agak anxious, kalau gue dapat things yg gua gak bisa pake, atau malah NSFW things. Pas giliran gue hati gue melorot,

Ada aturan yg ngasih hadiah mengaku dan hadiahnya diunboxing bareng, dan pas giliran gua, yg ngasih tiba2 ngomong ‚Äúgua kira ni becandaan aja, tapi ternyata pada bawa hadiah beneran‚Äù

Di situ ya hati gue melorot, something wrong coming my way. *M√§ kyll√§ sanon perkele suoraan ett√§*.

Hadiahnya item2 simple, sih, cuman ketika w buka atu2 di depan orang2 ada insinuasi NSFW thing, BDSM related. I will not list the item here, still salty remembering them. 

If I am woke (which I am not), I would say this is a terrible sexual joke. People laughed, and I do not know whether they laughed ***with*** or ***at*** me. I felt somehow being bullied, just like in my school days. I just give a dry laugh and force myself to feel happy. If the whole thing was a joke, why bother creating it firsthand?

W cuman visitor, bukan bagian dari orang2 itu. Their difference is too great: habit, hobby, expertise, freedom. Gua nahan salty aja selama acara. Awalnya ya angin lalu aja, tapi ya mikir juga biar pergi cepet2 dari situ. Perhaps these people is not my cup of coffee.

Pas pulang baru keinget trauma lama. Meskipun organizer minta maaf, whats the use? Lagian dah resiko, salahmu sendiri ikutan acara begituan.

At least the gift I prepared went to the hand of those who claimed they needed it. So thats enough a consolation.

Sisanya ya gua tulis di sini buat pelajaran.

When with strangers, expect the worst and the best things.

I‚Äôve been thinking about this decision for so long but I think there are really choices that linger in your mind, taking root, yet still feel impossible to act on. 

A little backstory, tambay kasi talaga ako sa discord. I live alone, away from my family and sometimes, it really does feel lonely and Discord was there to save the day. I made a lot of friends until I entered this one voice call where we met each other. 

Back in December 2022, I was 18 and I met this guy on a server on discord who eventually became a part of my everyday life. I shared so many things to him, may mga bagay na siya ang unang nakakaalam kesa sa main circle ko, may mga sikreto din akong siya lang ang may alam and that just shows how comfortable and open I was to him. He wasn‚Äôt just a friend; he was a constant. We‚Äôd talk every day, call for minutes or hours, and send each other the most mundane photo updates. This became our rhythm everyday.

But here‚Äôs the catch: we don‚Äôt know each other‚Äôs names, I don‚Äôt know where he studies (though he knows where I study, since I‚Äôve been open about it), or even what we look like. By all conventional measures, we‚Äôre strangers. We never even exchanged socials‚Äîno Instagram, no Facebook, no connection outside of Discord. Our bond has existed entirely in that bubble, for two years. Yes, two years. 

Yet, when I think of everything I do know about him, I realize just how much he‚Äôs not a stranger. These are just among others but he‚Äôs from Cavite, has four siblings, a dog named Dashy, and is taking up radiologic technology. He has trypophobia, doesn‚Äôt drink coffee, but has developed a growing love for matcha‚Äîsomething I proudly take full credit for! And similar to me, he‚Äôs also drawn to the quiet of late-night walks and finds comfort in the simplicity of strawberry-flavored food. He plays the electric guitar, has a passion for streetwear, ukay, and above all, his personality mirrors mine in ways that are almost uncanny. He has told me several stories of him too!

Ang daming nangyari sa loob ng dalawang taon na yun and even though he was never there physically, he was present. He was there during the quiet moments of my life and the loud ones, too. We saw each other graduate from senior high school, step into college, and grow into the person we are now. Through heartbreaks and rainbows, we had each other‚Äôs backs.

We‚Äôve thought about meeting up, of course. But I think that is one thing that excites and terrifies us both. But neither of us has been ready to take that step, and that‚Äôs okay. Ang dami lang tanong na naglalaro sa isipan ko. What if magbabago ang lahat if nagkita kami? What if yung connection pala na nabuo namin online ay iba pala sa totoong buhay? Pero paano din if magkita kami? What could be ahead of us? 

So why do I plan to cut ties with him? I don‚Äôt have an answer that feels good enough. But maybe because as I grow older, the idea na wala naman sigurong patutunguhan ito hits me hard? Or maybe there doesn‚Äôt have to be a reason. What I only know of is that he‚Äôll always hold a special place in my heart, one stitched together with matcha-flavored memories, late-night calls, and all the small, unspoken ways he made life lighter.",1,1734881722.0,CasualPH,0,1.0,False

I (16m) knew about it but did nothing. The reason? She bullied my sister (13f) for years, still bullies her at times when I'm not around. That's actually how our dad met her mom. There was a pretty big incident at school and dad and her mom were called in to speak to the principal and talk about a game plan. They consented to this buddy program for them so my stepsister would need to be there for my sister for a few hours each week at school (they're in different grades). After my dad went out for coffee with her mom and they ended up dating and married a year later.

My sister started getting bullied in first grade and the bullying got worse when our mom lost all custody of us. She ended up becoming an addict and wasn't safe to be around us. My stepsister found out through gossiping people and she tormented my sister about how much our mom didn't love us and stuff of that nature. Really broke my sister and then it led to the incident where my stepsister grabbed my sister by the hair and pushed her down in front of a bunch of other kids in the grade above my sister's (aka stepsister's grade).

My sister was really hurt when dad started dating the girls mom and I was pissed. Dad and I don't have a good relationship because of it and I told him and his wife that they are shitty people to do that to my sister. Our relationship has lots of conflict. I refuse to be nice to my stepsister either. She might be young but she has tortured my sister for 7 years now and it never gets better. My sister not being in high school yet means school is her safe space now for a year. Before that she didn't have a safe space at home or at school. I told my dad he did that and he told me things will get better and we're a family now.

When my stepsister started high school she had trouble adapting and then two girls in my grade started making fun of her. I heard about it but never saw it. By October everyone was talking about how the girls in my grade were slut shaming her and calling her all kinds of names. They also spread rumors about her and other stuff. I never said or did anything. A part of me was glad she was being subjected to a little of what she put my sister through. I made sure to keep my sister away from her as much as possible because I know my stepsister being bullied could have made her a worse bully.

Things got really bad at the start of the month and there was a fight between her and like five other girls. They all started taunting her and ganging up on her. After the incident her mom was called and my dad and her mom found out more. They were in and out of the school for a couple of weeks and last week they were told it was the talk of the school. Which made dad confront me about not doing anything. I told him I would never help her. I help my sister. Not her bully. I told him I don't give a fuck what happens to that other girl and I'm doing what he should have done and taken my sister's side and not expected her to play family with that brat.

Dad lectured me about it and I ignored him and because I wasn't apologizing for it the two of them lectured me more about not doing better and not apologizing.

I have an in house 1.3 gallon compost bin with compostable liners that I put my green waste into (including coffee grounds). I sprinkle a layer of Bokashi over whatever I put in. When they‚Äôre full I toss them in the tumbler. 

After thanksgiving, I chopped up leftover pumpkins and put them in the tumbler, which really helped fill it up. My browns are a mixture of leaves, plant trimmings, and cardboard (toilet paper and paper towel rolls/egg cartons). 

I still have left over pumpkin chunks and leaves so I‚Äôve created an outdoor pile next to the tumbler. So, my question is, what now? Obviously I have to wait for the process to work. But for maintenance, am I spinning that tumbler every time I go outside? Should I be adding in more Bokashi to move the process along? I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm ready to piss in it yet.

When I was 2 months pregnant I left my extremely demanding and stressful corporate job that I had to work 60 hours a week for, and I got another full time job at a coffee shop. I was unemployed for about 20 days. Fast forward to to two weeks ago, I went to a doctors appointment and found out I had high blood pressure, and my body was swelling, so they ordered me some tests as well as bed rest to make sure everything was okay. From that point on, we decided it was okay for me to take my maternity leave. My husband works nights, so he sleeps all day and then is gone all night, yesterday I asked him what was wrong, he had been in a mood all day. He told me that he feels like I don‚Äôt respect him. Keep in mind I cook for him, clean, do laundry, anything he asks I get it done. He said that I ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt be out running the roads‚Äù if I am a stay at home wife/mom, and that it‚Äôs disrespectful to him that I leave the house. Keep in mind, the only time I leave the house is to get groceries or something we need. I don‚Äôt hangout with friends, and I see my family once every 2-3 weeks. I‚Äôm not spending money, so I don‚Äôt see what the issue is here. I know he‚Äôs under a lot of stress at work, especially trying to pay the bills now, but it seems like he‚Äôs just become a different person. Am I crazy to think that what he‚Äôs saying is a little controlling? Or is he completely right? I‚Äôm trying to understand where he is coming from. ",1,1734881241.0,Marriage,16,1.0,False

So we've made this game with my friend. I wanna ask your honest opinion about it, suggestions are welcome! It's definitely not finished and needs to be polished. The game consists of two teams : The Ducks, and The Coffee team (don't ask me why, it's random lol). Two teams fight each others to gain territory, by throwing ducks or coffees on appartments in the map. The team with the most captured territory wins! Let me know your thoughts :)

First off, I have to say to my fellow brethren and lovers of RHOP -  my low key, personal favorite of the Housewives programming of our current Housewives era - thanks so much for joining us in our new, little ""curated,"" artisanal world of r/real_writers_of_bravo , home of Carole's eternal last summer, Happy and Ness, and the deep, nuanced, and original thinkers, readers, and writers of Bravo fandom. 

We have gotten so much love over there from this wonderful community and it truly shows in how thoughtful and lovely the convos have been there. I love having both of these communities as my main Bravo homes. 

Secondly, I just wanted to give you a heads up: we ARE hosting our first (but not our last) **Bravo writing contest starting today through Sunday, January 5th at 11:59 PM.** (Voting ends Tues, Jan 7th and winners will be announced Wed, Jan 8th). First place receives **50 reddit gold, second places receives 25, third place receives 10.** 

**Writing prompt is** ***What Does Bravo Mean to You*****?** Responses should be individual posts over there with the flair ""Writing Contest for Reddit $."" Length of response can be anything from a haiku to a novel so long as it is follows the rules ([quick and dirty version of the rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/comments/1hjzv32/real_writers_of_bravo_is_hosting_a_bravoholic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) \+ [longer version](https://www.reddit.com/r/real_writers_of_bravo/comments/1hjy29t/win_reddit_in_rwobs_first_writing_contest_what/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) here) and you only use your words (no memes, gifs, images, or anything but words in entries allowed). 

Hoping to continue to see some great RHOP fan rep over there in that weird, quirky, but fun coffee shop where you go to hang out with your liberal arts friends that we call RWOB. 

PS Thank you leaders of this RHOP community for supporting our getting the word out about this community. It is meant to be merely be a compliment to all the great stuff happening over here.

‚ö™Ô∏è They joked about me looking serious, saying that every time they looked over at me, I had an expression that was like I was going to get a mugshot, which made me laugh. It felt like they were paying attention to me, and when they gave me eye contact, I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling!

‚ö™Ô∏è After that, there wasn't much, but they mentioned the chorus (other students) behind us were good at singing. (why did I almost laugh, I shouldn‚Äôt laugh though because they‚Äôre into music and might know those people..)

There might be more because I can't fully recall. 

Now we're near break though, and I won't see them until next year.

I really want to befriend them, but know it'll be near impossible once school starts. We don't sit near each other and rarely have a chance for interaction. They also have friends that they always speak to.

**tl;dr:** this makes better coffee than my 2022 Jura E8.

As an initial review I am going to keep this short, with more detailed feedback to follow as I get to use the machine more.

* Built like a tank. No really, this makes my Jura seem cheap and plasticky in comparison.
* Build quality, in general, is superlative. Fit, finish, lines, water tank, bean hopper, drip tray and drawer, grounds container, brew group door. Swiss (Germans), that's for sure.
* Dialing in was easy, perhaps even more so due to a high quality fresh roasted bean. I am using GA400 from peach coffee roasters in Atlanta. It's a well-balanced medium roast blend. We like it. I settled on making the grinding one level finer than it was set from factory.
* Ease of cleaning: could not be simpler. On screen instructions literally make it fool-proof. I am used to far more complications.
* Screen is big, easy to read and intuitive. Saving coffee settings to profiles is an awesome feature.
* What have we tried?
   * Espresso, outstanding
   * Milk based drinks in no particular order, cortado, macchiato, flat white. All 3 stellar with the flat white perhaps my personal favourite so far. Rivals what I expect when I am on the go in Europe travelling for work from a good barista.
   * Coffee, yes it makes a very good cup of ordinary coffee, especially if you dial down the grind strength. As all the drinks will be espresso based you can play settings here.
* Milk cleaning: As elementary as it gets.
* Loudness: what loudness ? The KF8 duly earns its quiet mark rating. Everything is muted, I am guessing due to solid noise insulation and refined internal mechanics. Way softer grinding and pouring than my E8.
* Screen brightness: After a few minutes will dim. This is nice, that it is not always on full brightness.
* LCD screen: clear, readable and bright. Will it win clarity awards ? No, this is not the 4K OLED TV you are looking for. Off axis viewing, as with all LCD panels and limitations inherent in the tech will show slightly muted colours and brightness. I am 6 foot 5 and notice it as I look down at the screen. But this does not bother me. I can see and read everything perfectly.
* Bean hopper: takes a full 250g bag and the lid seals tightly.
* Colour: We got the Juniper and love it. It is a grey olive. In bright light it looks more green, in lower light it is more grey. A bit green grey gun metal if that is a thing. [Juniper Colour varying shades ](https://www.imgur.com/a/K4qmALn)
* Water tank: solid fit, easy to access, holds plenty of water.
* Rinsing: as others have observed, it rinses on start-up, shut down and for easy milk cleaning. Nothing irregular to report back on. Easy and convenient.
* Puck size and quality: judge for yourself, here are the pictures. I'm impressed, you can see the different grind strengths used here for different drinks. I like it strong, my wife prefers a medium to lower setting.

I am sure there will be some negatives and annoyances to follow once the honeymoon phase is over, but for now, at the price $1,330 including GA taxes, (Whirlpool F&F discount thank you u/supercasualman !, and an additional $65 off for Cybermonday), you simply cannot beat this value proposition. 

I am more impressed than when I purchased my Jura E8 in 2022, and that was my dream machine.

1hk08yc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hk08yc/the_inside_of_a_humans_head/,The inside of a human's head ,"The music played in the background in a language I couldn‚Äôt understand‚Äîa cheerful, upbeat tune. I looked at myself in the mirror, discovering the man with long, greasy hair, one movement of the hair trimmer at a time.

‚ÄúUh, not bad. A bald head suits me.‚Äù I mumbled, winking at the reflection.

Hair filled the sink, the trimmer revealing pale skin underneath all that mess I‚Äôd just removed. I turned my head towards the video playing on the small floating screen to my left, another man like myself, though much more dapper than I, talking about different ways to style one‚Äôs beard.

*‚ÄúShould I shave it off too?‚Äù* The thought crossed my mind, as I moved my head from left to right, checking out the beard to see what I‚Äôve got to work with.

‚ÄúA ducktail is a style popular for a lot of men with thick beards, who prefer to maintain a long beard‚Ä¶ Works well with a narrow head shape.‚Äù The guy in the video prattled on.

*‚ÄúIs my head narrow? I don‚Äôt think so. Fuck it, I‚Äôll give the look a try, can always shave it all off if it sucks.‚Äù* I decided, following the video tutorial closely, working my greasy and wild beard into a more refined and elegant shape.

‚ÄúA gentleman, if ever I‚Äôve seen one.‚Äù I smiled at the reflection.

I took a step back, looking over the entire body in the mirror as if checking a newly purchased item. Tall, definitely too skinny for my liking, but what else to expect from a junkie. There was work to be had, but I wasn‚Äôt too dissatisfied. I lifted my arm, sniffing under it before frowning.  
‚ÄúUgh, you need a bath buddy. I smell like ass.‚Äù

Before I could get into the shower, the doorbell rang.  
‚ÄúPizza delivery!‚Äù Came a voice from the other side of the door.

*‚ÄúOh boy!‚Äù* I rushed to the door, which wasn‚Äôt far from the bathroom. My apartment was small. Bed, kitchen, bathroom, it was all in the living room. No balcony to speak of. I kicked empty pizza boxes that littered the floor on my way to the door. Pizza was great. So many different flavours. I couldn‚Äôt get enough of the stuff, already eaten through 5 boxes since I got home last night. I could eat it forever and never get tired of it.

The front door slid open with a beep, and my ecstatic expression at the thought of pizza was greeted by the barrel of a handgun pointed right at me.  
  
‚ÄúPizza?‚Äù I asked, looking at the mechanical individual standing at the door, but couldn‚Äôt notice any pizza boxes on him.

‚ÄúNo pizza, bitch. But you know what this is?‚Äù he said, tilting the gun to the side a bit so I could get a better look at it.  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. An atomizer. One shot from this bad boy and there won‚Äôt be even a spec of you left to divide.‚Äù

I looked at him a while longer, this time actually paying attention to the details of his clothes and appearance.  
‚ÄúAh, you‚Äôre a Zailurian.‚Äù

He kept his gun pointed at my face as it scanned me. A moment of silence passed before the weapon beeped and a surprised look arose on his robotic face.  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre human? Bullshit.‚Äù the man mumbled, reinitiating the scan.

Another minute went by, and the same result came up on the weapon‚Äôs display again, causing him to look even more stumped than the first time. Before he could say anything else, the elevator dinged from down the hall, the pizza delivery drone exiting once the doors opened and heading our way.

‚ÄúYay, the pizza‚Äôs here.‚Äù I clapped my hands together and pushed past the man in front of me to take several pizza boxes from the drone.

‚ÄúHow do you have money for that?‚Äù the Zailuran asked, lowering his weapon halfway to conceal it from the pizza drone.

‚ÄúBeats me. I just yell ‚Äòpizza‚Äô at that floating screen over there and pizza arrives shortly after. They never asked me to pay.‚Äù I reply, walking back inside.  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just stand there, come on it. Help yourself to some pizza, while I finish cleaning this body up.‚Äù

The mechanical stranger walked inside my apartment after me. He pushed some boxes from the couch in the corner and sat down.  
‚ÄúSo, where are you?‚Äù

I put the pizza boxes on the cluttered coffee table, immediately opening a box and pulling out a slice.  
‚ÄúFuck, this is amazing.‚Äù

My attention was diverted to him again once the door automatically closed. With my free hand, I slapped my bald head.  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm in here.‚Äù

The was a long pause between the two of us, him sitting and looking at me while I gorged myself on slice after slice, letting out a few moans of delight every once in a while.  
After the first box was empty, I stopped and looked over at him.

‚ÄúSo, where the fuck am I?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúEarth. Mega City 9.‚Äù the stranger replied.

‚ÄúWere earthlings always this full of metal?‚Äù I continued with more questions.

‚ÄúNo. But they have been augmenting themselves with cybernetics for about a century now. That poses a problem for you, doesn‚Äôt it? You can‚Äôt assimilate inorganic matter.‚Äù he replied with a slight smirk.

‚ÄúYeah. It sucks. Even this guy had a lot of shit in his head, but he was the most organic one I could find.‚Äù I slapped my naked body on the chest.

‚ÄúHow are you alive?‚Äù the Zailurian asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do you one better. Why are YOU here?‚Äù I grinned.

‚ÄúYou know that already. Your species is an Armageddon-level threat to every fucking planet in this galaxy. I‚Äôm here to exterminate you before you start to accumulate biomass.‚Äù He replied, pulling out his gun but not pointing it at me this time.

‚ÄúSo why aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù I said, opening the second pizza box.  
‚ÄúPepperoni is fucking amazing man. Too bad you bots don‚Äôt eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst, you‚Äôre human. Meaning that you haven‚Äôt assimilated that body. Second, you‚Äôre alive, which shouldn‚Äôt be possible.‚Äù the Zailurian replied, looking at me with interest.

‚ÄúYeah. My head feels very clear, very quiet. Almost empty. I feel alone, can‚Äôt contact myself. Maybe it‚Äôs this planet‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù he interrupted.  
‚ÄúYOU shouldn‚Äôt be. Your kind doesn‚Äôt have a sense of individuality. You are just biomass, psychically linked to the Hive. You are all one entity. When a Hive gets destroyed, all of its extensions die out immediately.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre saying the Hive got destroyed? That‚Äôs a shame. How?‚Äù I looked at him, his words did not strike any particular feeling in me, not like that was ever possible.

‚ÄúIt got caught in the orbit of a Red Giant which was then remotely forced to go supernova. You‚Äôre a far way from your mass.‚Äù He said, beaming with pride. It must‚Äôve been his kind that was responsible for that.

‚ÄúI see. That explains a lot.‚Äù I finish the second box, thinking back on the night I came into contact with my current body.

It was a cold, rainy night. I felt weak and exhausted as if I was dying. My abilities were gone, I could not think straight or even do much. All I could do was look for a place to die. I decided to crawl under a bridge, not feeling in the mood to die in the rain. That‚Äôs where I came across him, a needle still stuck in his arm, passed out on the concrete.

The Zailurian cleared his throat to grab my attention, snapping me from being lost in thought.  
‚ÄúYou said you‚Äôre inside the skull. How? Can you get out?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can totally get out. I just took refuge in here since it looked like a good place to die. And his brain was fried anyway. Watch this, sucka!‚Äù  
I stood up from the couch and walked over to the kitchen, rummaging through the dishes before pulling out a decently sized kitchen knife. Blood dripped down my face as I jammed the blade into the skull, making a full circle around the head like opening a can. Once that was done, I grabbed the top of the head and lifted it, revealing myself to the Zailurian.

‚ÄúTa-dah.‚Äù I laughed.  
‚ÄúAnd I can leave whenever I want‚Äù  
I said, fleshy tentacles gripping the side of the skull. I strained myself a bit before hopping out, the human body flipping lifelessly on the floor. Blood was everywhere on the kitchen floor and on some of the cupboards and shelves. My triumph was short-lived, as suddenly I felt myself growing colder and colder. I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I couldn‚Äôt move.

‚ÄúWhaaatt? I‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt breathe‚Ä¶‚Äù Came from the body on the floor, as a few tendrils still connected me to it, allowing me to talk.

‚ÄúQuick, put me‚Ä¶ back in.‚Äù I looked around, but since the body was lying face down on the floor, I couldn‚Äôt see much.

A pair of metallic hands picked me up from the floor. I could feel them squeezing, the Zailurian planning to crush me into a pulp no doubt. But that final squeeze never came. I felt myself carried through the air and stuffed back inside the open skull on the floor. Quickly, I extended my tendrils, connecting them back to the spinal column of the body, feeling myself become more alive by the second.

‚ÄúUgh, that was fucking awful.‚Äù I groaned, slowly picking myself off the floor and standing up, grabbing a stapler from the desk and stapling my skull closed.

‚ÄúI see. You must have gotten in contact with that human right as your Hive got destroyed. So instead of fully assimilating him, you‚Äôve replaced his brain and attached yourself to his vitals to survive.‚Äù the machine-man replied, cleaning the blood from his hands with a paper towel before sitting back down on the couch.

‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm the brain now?‚Äù I asked, sitting next to him and leaning back.

‚ÄúSeems like it, though I assume you‚Äôve probably replaced his entire nervous system by now. Seeing how you can‚Äôt talk or see without being connected to the body.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sucks ass, man.‚Äù sighing, I opened the third pizza box. ‚ÄòMeatLovers delight‚Äô, my newfound favourite.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just curious why you can‚Äôt assimilate the entire body. Your kind replicates cells, then destroys the original.‚Äù He rubbed his chin while thinking, talking more to himself than to me.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I can‚Äôt remember a lot of things. I can‚Äôt explain it. I remember more how to be human than how to be myself.‚Äù I answered, waving the slice around, getting some grease on the machine‚Äôs shirt.

‚ÄúWatch where you wave that, motherfucker.‚Äù The Zailurian growled, trying to wipe his shirt with the paper towel before the stain got permanent, but it was too late.

‚ÄúSo, you gonna atomize me now?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. This is an interesting development. You have a symbiotic relationship with that body. Of course, I‚Äôll keep an eye on you, if you go haywire then I‚Äôll put you down.‚Äù he sighed when his efforts to clean his shirt failed, causing him to frown and stand up.

Something softly clattered on the coffee table, causing us both to look down. A staple. The Zailurian looked up at me. One by one, all the staples fell out as the wound healed fully.  
‚ÄúSeems you have more effect on the body than just being the brain. Maybe I should ice you before things get out of hand.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, don‚Äôt be a bitch and backtrack on your previous statement,‚Äù I argued back.

‚ÄúOh? You afraid to die? I thought your kind had no concept of ever being alive in the first place.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, but I am curious about this too. Plus, I have two more boxes of pizza in front of me, and like a dozen more flavours I haven‚Äôt tried yet. Once I try ‚Äòem all, you can kill me, I don‚Äôt give a fuck.‚Äù I waved him off nonchalantly.

Before he could finalize his decision, the doorbell rang. He looked over at me, the look on his face asking if I was expecting another pizza order. I shook my head, standing up and walking over to the door.  
‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh thank goodness, you‚Äôre home, Diego. Open the door.‚Äù Came a female voice from the other side.

I looked over at the machine man sitting on the couch, shrugged and opened the door, coming face to face with a short woman. She had short, dirty blonde hair, and was dressed like those business girls I‚Äôve seen on the floating square. The look on her face however was one of shock and embarrassment.

‚ÄúUh, Diego. Where are your clothes?‚Äù she asked, averting her eyes from my naked body and looking up at me. Her eyes widened even further when she noticed the dry blood that was covering my head and face.  
‚ÄúOh god, you‚Äôre bleeding. What happened? Are you alright? Do I need to call in the medical team?‚Äù She blurted out, panic evident in her voice.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs fine. He just fell and hit his head.‚Äù The Zailurian chimed in from the couch.

‚ÄúHey dude. This chick seems to know me. Maybe she and I are supposed to breed or something.‚Äù I turned around towards the machine man, a confused look on my face while pointing to the girl with my thumb.

Before I could even fully turn around and face her again, her small hand flew across the side of my face with incredible force, causing me to stumble back.

‚ÄúYou rude, inconsiderate bastard. Your father was worried sick and so was I. Thinking you finally bit the dust under some bridge with a needle in your arm. ‚ÄòBreed‚Äô, as if.‚Äù She yelled, her face turning redder by the minute.

I was shocked, feeling the unfamiliar burning sensation on the side of my face.

‚ÄúBut since you are alive and well, fucking around with your dealer over there, I will simply deliver your father‚Äôs message to you. You‚Äôre cut off. He will not fund your deplorable lifestyle any longer. You have one last chance to get your sorry, drug-ridden ass to rehab or he will remove you from his will as well. Have a good day.‚Äù

Before I could even say a word, she turned around and stormed off down the hallway towards the elevator. I turned around to the Zailurian, still rubbing my face.  
‚ÄúWhat did she do to me? And what‚Äôs cut-off mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that? That‚Äôs pain. She smacked the shit out of you.‚Äù He laughed.  
‚ÄúAs for cut-off, means no more money.‚Äù

The sensation was a novel one for sure. Seems I still wasn‚Äôt done discovering new things that came with this body I now had.  
‚ÄúFuck I need money for?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis apartment, food, water. No more money, no more pizza.‚Äù the stranger explained, much to my horror.

‚ÄúI need to get more money right now! How do I do that?‚Äù I ran over from the door and sat on the couch, ready to hear what I must do. A life without pizza wouldn‚Äôt be worth living.

‚ÄúHold on, hold on. She seemed to be a secretary or the assistant of someone. Whoever you are or, well, were, seems to have had a pretty rich daddy.‚Äù The Zailurian said, pulling a scanner from his coat and pointing it at my face.

After a few seconds, the device beeped and the look on his face lit up with surprise.  
‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll be. You‚Äôre Diego Rivera. Of the Rivera Robotics Incorporated. Biggest military and police robotics manufacturer on the continent.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds good, right?‚Äù I asked, not understanding a single thing he said.

‚ÄúVery good and very bad. Means if you weren‚Äôt a junkie, you‚Äôd be loaded as fuck. On second hand, if your old man gets even a whiff of the fact his son‚Äôs body is piloted by an extra-terrestrial, he will pluck you out of that skull and either kill you or make you into some fucked up bioweapon.‚Äù

‚ÄúUgh, sounds like a headache.‚Äù I groaned and slumped in my seat, flipping over the second to last box of pizza.

‚ÄúIt is, for both of us. I‚Äôm stationed here to keep an eye on humanity. So, if this gets out of hand, it‚Äôll become my mess to fix.‚Äù the stranger slumped in his seat as well.

‚ÄúYou could just kill me. Seems less work for both of us.‚Äù I suggested.

‚ÄúWell, knowing what I know now, I can‚Äôt kill you. You‚Äôre human. Even if your brain isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a fucking loophole.‚Äù He groaned, rubbing his mechanical face with his hands.

‚ÄúSo, what do we do now?‚Äù

‚ÄúSeems like you‚Äôll just have to learn how to be Diego from now on. Start by showering and putting on some clothes. Meanwhile, I‚Äôll go dig up everything on Diego and his family, so you can have some homework to do when I‚Äôm back.‚Äù the Zailurian stood up and headed for the door.

‚ÄúHey, hold on homes. Now we know I‚Äôm called Diego. What do we call you?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúCall me Gart.‚Äù He replied while leaving.

‚ÄúGood enough for me.‚Äù",8,1734880020.0,HFY,3,0.83,False

I dont have this issue when im outside with friends or at work. But its always with my family. Anyone faced something similar but found a way to overcome it?

I would be caffeine free for a month or more and then go back to it for like a week and then again withdraw. I really want to quit caffeine for long stretch of time to see what more benefits I can reap from it. Or just to make it my lifestyle. Because the benefits are insane.

I someone know that the only solution is to stick with it using my will power. But im asking just in case I find some new way that ive never tried before.

Yesterday I was in a lot of pain due to my hernias. When I mentioned this to my dad, who knows about the hernias, he went on like ‚ÄúWHAT?! Multiple hernias? Well that‚Äôs just wrong. Usually people only have one. Like me.. I‚Äôve had a hernia for half my life and it doesn‚Äôt even cause me pain. My friend Ron also has a hernia that doesn‚Äôt cause pain. Though now my biggest concern is this stomach ulcer. I‚Äôve been drinking less coffee and eating less spicy food. It‚Äôs getting better now. But yea, the hernia.. that shouldn‚Äôt cause you pain. And are you sure there‚Äôs more than one?‚Äù 

He has a similar response any time I tell him about health problems that he doesn‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs always ‚Äúare you sure? You need to get a second opinion‚Äù. For more serious health problems, I actually do seek a second opinion‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs like he can‚Äôt acknowledge it. I‚Äôll say that I‚Äôve seen multiple doctors and surgeons, and he just replies like ‚Äúit sounds like you need to get a 4th opinion‚Äù. 

He doesn‚Äôt trust doctors. But he also doesn‚Äôt trust me. I know my body and when I‚Äôm venting about a health problem, I am always 100% certain about that problem. But he doesn‚Äôt believe me ever. 

He also pretends to forget things that I tell him, just so he can act shocked all over again. I‚Äôd been pre-diabetic for years, and when I crossed that threshold into officially diabetic he acted totally shocked. A huge shocked reaction, almost with the purpose of shaming me. 
But then‚Ä¶. Every time I mention my diabetes, he acts shocked like I‚Äôm telling him for the first time. I‚Äôve been diabetic for over a year now, and if I talked to him about it right now he‚Äôd be like ‚ÄúWHAT?!?!‚Äù. 

Another example is the warts on my feet. I‚Äôve been trying to get rid of them for years now, but due to all my autoimmune stuff they are extremely difficult to actually get rid of. Every time I mention the warts, he acts so disgusted and shocked. ‚ÄúWHAT?! Those aren‚Äôt gone yet?.. you know I‚Äôve had warts and they go away in a month with treatment‚Äù. I‚Äôve told him so many times that the type of warts I have may never go away, which is what doctors have told me. I‚Äôm still treating them with hope though. But it‚Äôs like my dad treats me like I‚Äôm disgusting and wrong for having them. 

Unrelated-to-health example: One of his favourite hobbies is disrespecting my mother (who left him 10+ years ago). Whenever she makes plans my siblings and I, my dad pretends not to know about it. We‚Äôll tell him the details over and over, not that it‚Äôs any of his business what we do with our mom.. he just insists on knowing, so we tell him. But then it‚Äôs like he purposely forgets! We‚Äôd be leaving for our mom‚Äôs house and he‚Äôd be like ‚Äúwhere are you going? I had dinner planned and everything (often a lie, as he wouldn‚Äôt have dinner prepared)‚Äù. 

Why does he purposely forget things? It‚Äôs like he waits, calculated and manipulative, for any opportunity to get offended at something. If he can be shocked about something, he can make it a big issue, which is his goal. But why does he do this?

Is he so threatened by things that he has no control over that his brain forces him to forget about it? Or is it calculated forgetfulness to use his shock as a weapon against others? ",1,1734879677.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Here's what changed:
- My energy is consistent throughout the day
- Inflammation throughout my body subsided completely
- My focus is great and my ADHD is manageable without meds
- My anxiety and depression have both disappeared
- I have 1 cup of coffee in the morning after food and don't need to reach for caffeine after that
- My PMS has pretty much disappeared and my flow monthly has gotten significantly lighter, making it manageable

Why I'm posting this:

Normally, I am the one complaining about mosquito bites. One particular time at a drive-in, I walked away with over 50 mosquito bites on my back. I never understood how no one else would get bitten. My husband and I will go outside at dusk and I'll want to go straight back in because I'm getting bitten and he isn't.

We both have A+ blood types so we knew it wasn't that.

For context: My daily sugar intake was at LEAST 60-80g of sugar a day. For example, on a work day, I'd have 2 iced Matchas at Starbucks which was 66g of sugar alone, let alone my undying love for carbs & my sweet tooth. When I realized this (7 weeks ago) I decided to cut sugar.

(Worth noting I did have a 4-6 day period during the first month of no-sugar when my electrolytes were out of whack and my feet and hands were so uncomfortably cold. When I figured out what it was, things leveled out.)

Fast forward to today... we just got back from Mexico where people were getting bit by mosquitoes. Where I walked away without a single bite. For the first time in my life.

I have a plethora of food allergies which that paired with my inflammation led me to want to do this sugar-free life in the first place but by golly, no mosquito bites might just propel me forward for the rest of my life!?",5,1734879551.0,sugarfree,1,1.0,False
1hk01x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/1hk01x4/emotional_taunts_and_how_to_fix_my_fathers/,Emotional Taunts and How to fix my father's relationship with his own family,"Hi everyone, this is my first time on this sub and I hope to find some answers on how to fix my relationship with my father and his overall attitude towards life itself.



I am 24 years old now and I learned today that my dad wasn't even there during my birth. It does not break me since I think that my birth was delayed to December and he had to leave for work to another country. However, it is the emotional turmoil that he brings upon my mother and my sister that I can't stand. My mom has been through hell with this man and his family, for example, when I was 9 months old, my mom had to board a flight to move to his place of residence when she has never left the state she and her family lived in. It gets worse, when I heard from my mom that she had to wait for 2 more hours at the arrivals of a completely new country (UAE) just for him to pick us up. This was just the beginning of my life with my parents and as I grew older to became a teenager, it significantly got worse. To even the point, that my mother contemplated to end it all but she lived on with this abuse for the sake of me and my sister, for which we are always grateful. My dad is extremely frugal in the sense that he has never bought us anything for our family that wasn't either free/cheap/benefits given by the company he works. For example, me and my sister's education was paid till high school by the company my dad works for. I enrolled in one of the top institutes in India where I received a really good scholarship that reduced the fees to 6000 USD (5 Lakhs INR), I was given a monthly allowance by my dad and for extra expenditure I had to ask my mom since my dad never cared. My mom then did not have a source of income, and only gets money from my dad on a monthly basis, so from that money she used to help me out during college, now she does the same for my sister. She also use that monthly allowance to take care of livelihood expenses. She has in her life done this several times, for example, when I celebrate my birthday, my mother used to give money from her savings to buy me gifts etc., I have never received anything with love from my dad, if he did buy something for me, he would not stop talking about it to the point that I have stopped asking anything from him and do not even expect anything. 



Anyway, jump to the present, where I have a job and living life independently, I am still concerned about my mother and my sister's education. She has joined a medical college to become a doctor and he has agreed to pay for it full (which I hope wont change). Even though he has agreed it, my father still berates my mom about how much expensive it gets to put my sister through college. I don't want my mother to have go to through all this at her age of 50. The thing I don't understand is my father earns a lot of money and do not spend on anything since he is frugal. So what does he really plan to do with the money? Wasn't the hardwork you put in your 20s and 30s to provide a better life for you and your family? or was it just for yourself? I wouldn't believe it was for himself because he is so cheap that he will not buy new clothes, new shoes, new experiences, at least in front of us. I am pretty sure that when my mother, sister and myself are around him, he spends a lot of money on just ordering food from outside, buy new clothes or live a lavish life. I have come to the conclusion that he lives a frugal life because he wants to show us that he came from a poor household and this is how he lives. The worst part is, he scolds me and my mom for living decently and not being cheap, using money that I have earned. He earns about 8-9k usd/month and lives in Bahrain and only gives my mom about 400 dollars to manage the cooking, buying groceries, and any other livelihood expenses and nothing more. From this money, she sends my sister to cover for any extras that she has which she typically can't ask my dad. My sister like I used to get also receives a monthly allowance while studying. 

  
I think I may have reached my last straw with this man, because I have given him several chances to improve and he has toned down the anger and physical abuse towards my mother but still abuses her emotionally on expenses and simple things. When I was doing my undergrad, I always felt bad for my mom to suffer my father's complaining about paying for my tuition and expenses in college. Note, he does not express that anger towards me except only when I ask him for extra money. After I finished my undergrad, I thought he would improve since his only expenditure really is my sister's tuition and expenses and their own living expenses. Unfortunately no, he continues to complain about paying so much for my sister to become a doctor. I don't understand it, what are you going to do with the money that you have earned and saved so far, are you going to build a grave so big enough to keep all your cash with you? Look, I couldn't care less about how a man spends his own money, but when it affects my mother and my sister, I can't take it anymore. Recently, they went on a pilgrimage to a place where my dad, a frugal being, only drank coffee/tea from places that a decent family would think twice to enter and my mother said no to that. My dad told her, that, ""Oh you can only have food from expensive restaurants?"", my mom does not respond to such shit questions, since she knows that he is only trying to provoke a fight. Mind you, this was after several hours of traveling so my mother took my sister to eat from a restaurant that was nearby to their hotel and that is the only meal they had that day. My sister then next day, while in church fainted because of this neglect, I cannot say it was entirely because of only eating one meal.



Now he has come up with a new plan for me, to pursue grad school in the US/Australia and is always on me about it. I don't want to go ahead with this plan since taking money from him, would mean that I would have to live on his terms and my mother would have to suffer him even more. I am finding alternative options to fund for grad school. 



This was a long rant, I feel, but I still would not want to distance myself from my father because I still see good in him, and I want to bring that out in him. I am on holiday for 3 weeks to celebrate Christmas and New Year with my parents and was hoping to see something change in him. The other day, we went to the mall, to buy myself some new clothes and we decided that we will eat out, while eating, he complains about spending money on the food and I have learned to just ignore it or just jokingly say something back. Its these emotional taunts that me and my mother can't take anymore about money. My mother used to work as a teacher in school but had to quit her job because again, my father. He was negligent of taking care of us while my mother was away for work and the pressure from her work and abuse at home, she couldn't take it anymore, so she quit to focus only on us till present.  

I brought my PS5 to introduce my dad to gaming, he loves football, so do I, and I wanted to play FIFA with him during these holidays. But all he said was, stop wasting money on toys like this, you are not a kid. I regret bringing my PS5 because he keeps attacking me on about it, that I am not focused on my future, that I am not ambitious to go study grad school and would rather waste time on gaming, that I am not saving enough money to go abroad and study. On the contrary, i try me best to save money, I just wanted to purchase my childhood dream of playing games so I couldn't care less what he says.

I am sorry this was more of rant, than an actual question, but I need to know from all of you, how do I fix my relationship with my father, how do I show him that there's a life outside of his phone (he's addicted to reels nowadays), how do I show him that shouting at my mother on my sister's birthday (that is today) brings down the mood for all of us, and increases the emotional distance between him and his family?",1,1734879451.0,AskParents,1,1.0,False

1hk00jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1hk00jt/lonely_in_college/,Lonely in college,"I hate posting these kinds of things so much because I sound like I peaked in high school, but college is so lonely. I went to a community college for a bit. It was pretty lonely because it felt like there was no time to talk and be with people like in high school. If I tried staying after class to talk, I felt creepy. People usually left as soon as class ended too, so they were rushing to leave. Even when I went to events or stayed in the cafeteria between classes, people were already with friend groups or doing something where it was obvious they wouldn't want to be bothered (studying, reading, had in headphones, etc.) The only reason I wasn't lonely was because I had two friends from high school that had time to hang once a week.

Now, I moved to a different country and it's so much worse. Almost all my classes are 6-9pm. Nobody wants to talk because they're tired. The people that don't mind talking are old enough to be my mom, so I can't hang with them.

I did have some earlier classes with people my age, but we had nothing in common. They're all active duty Air Force and literally got quiet when I brought up my interests instead of talking about work like them... I don't have a job. They'd just awkwardly nod or say ""Oh, cool"" until they could talk about work again.

I try making friends in third places and community events, but it's hard. Americans and non-Americans. It feels like it's either all middle-high schoolers, active duty soldiers, wine moms, old enough to be my mom, they seem cool, but they're like 35+ and have their own life, or they're doing something and don't want to be bothered.

Even comic shops, coffee, library, mall, sip-and-paint, etc. People are too young for me or too old to hang with.",1,1734879334.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

When he does he can‚Äôt say much of anything with substance.

On my Dad‚Äôs bad days, he will refuse to go to the coffee shop with my mom (their daily morning routine), refuse to eat and won‚Äôt take his meds. He can‚Äôt express his emotions and he will never tell her how he feels, or why he won‚Äôt do these things. It breaks her heart, and he knows that this is what bothers her and what gets her attention the most. Just yesterday he locked himself in the office from 10am to 8pm. For most of the time, he was sitting in the room in the dark, awake, but pretending to sleep with his head down whenever my mom would go to check on him. When he finally came out, he still wouldn‚Äôt tell my mom how he was feeling for hours.

The only thing that‚Äôs helped so far in moments like these is when my mom asks one of my siblings to either give him a call and chat about something for 10 mins (like his granddaughters), or stop by the house.

Hello! I just got a breville barista pro for the first time and have been struggling to dial the beans in. Ive weighed the beans before grinding at 18g, and with a grind time of 12,5s i keep getting 15g out. The inner grinder dial is at 5, the outer set at 10, and its giving me a smooth pull, 29ml espresso out (29 seconds ) Currently using the house blend by five elephant, and i think the coffee is coming out somewhat bitter. What am i possibly doing wrong? I tried a finer grind size but ended up with much less espresso out. Do i need to increase my grind time? Or is it likely another issue?",1,1734878453.0,espresso,2,0.67,False
1hjzpud,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueofdreamers/comments/1hjzpud/a_day_with_raven_qa/,A day with Raven (Q&A),"Q: How do you like the frosts in Russia?

A: They invigorate me.

Q: Dear Sir, he who must not be named)) ü§´ How do you feel about Nikolai? And could you become friends?

A: I like many of the qualities of the young Count Lansky. However, some of them at the same time make me want to roll my eyes. I think this is a good basis for further communication.

Q: Let's imagine a reality in which you had to enter into battle with the Egyptian god Anubis, who do you think would win?

A: I would very much like to meet the patron of funeral rituals. If nothing restrained his power, I am sure he would have prevailed over me. Would death await me in that case? Who knows.

Q: Is it true that you are very old, or is it all one big joke?

A: Age is relative. Compared to the gods mentioned in the question above, I am a baby.

Q: Do you have a familiar? Or maybe you had one?

A: Familiars are mysterious creatures that I dare not speak about openly, so as not to disturb the fabric of magic.

Clarifying question: Forgive me for clarifying, but it is important: have you ever seen a scriptum about familiars?

A: Yes, I have.

Q: What is it like to be the most mysterious and talked about person in the Coven for several centuries?

A: Tolerable.

Q: Good afternoon, esteemed supreme witcher!
1. How often do you think about the Roman Empire?
2. Tell us, what were your expectations for the future of the knowers when America was discovered?
3. Can you tell us about any of the outstanding members of the triumvirate of the past?
4. What is the craziest thing women have done to get your attention? For example, did they steal a ship from Russian counts for you?

A:
1. According to Marcus Aurelius, ""life is what we think about it."" I would not want my life to be the Roman Empire. And yet I mentioned the Roman philosopher.
2. Interesting question. At that time I was busy with some problems in Europe, so my thoughts about the future in the context of the world were limited. 
3. Each of them was outstanding in their own way. Some for their deeds, some for their indifference, others for their wickedness or sharp mind. It so happened that people learn about the past through the veil of past years and centuries, which gives rise to the most interesting inconsistencies. So why should I destroy these inconsistencies with the story of a ""contemporary""? 
4. I would not allow myself to defame the honor of any of the women I met with such stories. 

Q: At the time when you were learning magic, the Academy did not yet exist. Please share the secret of how your training took place? By the way, are you an Element or a Grimoire? 

A: The process of my learning the art of magic can be called instinctive. In those days, the knowers were not yet called either Grimoires or Elements. I think these concepts do not apply to me to this day.

Q: Lord Supreme Witcher! Do you have a favorite flower? If so, which ones?

A: I like almost all flowers. After all, most of them are short-lived, and invariably end their journey when their time comes.

Q: May the Norns illuminate your fate, Supreme Witcher! And by the way, about fate. Can you share at what exact moment did you realize that Esther Crow was not a woman of indifference to you? üòä

A: They say that someone else's soul is darkness. Mine is darkness. And even I can't find an exact answer in it.

Q: What was it like to pretend to be an aristocrat during the persecution of witches and warlocks? Wasn't it sickening to be among people who held thoughts about burning and torturing the wise?

A: In those days, I often thanked the mask for hiding my facial expression.

Q: First of all, Happy Birthday! Secondly, how can I be as confident and do what I want?

A: Any confidence requires goals and motivations. Find what will become your driving force.

Q: I would really like to better understand from what sources the seers draw their power. There is the magic of the Elements and the Grimoire, there is some ancient magic. What other sources of magical powers are there? And what is yours, if it is not a secret?

A: There are many interpretations. I believe that the canvas of magic is one for the world, and everyone draws from it what is due in their own ways.

Q: Tell me, how do you like your long life? Perhaps you would like to finally find peace? Or do you like everything?

A: I would like to find freedom of choice.

Q: Please tell me, have you ever had to invent spells, and if so, which ones? How does one invent a spell with given properties?

A: Yes, I have. Spells are designed to direct the flow of magic in the right direction and lead to the desired result. There are many ways to achieve this through formulas, words, and thoughts. Inventing a spell can be compared to deriving a mathematical formula.

Q: Supreme Witcher, what is magic for you personally? How do you feel it?

A: Like a stormy night.

Q: Raven, you once told Lady Crow that if she walked for a long time with her mouth open in the cold, her teeth would freeze. Have you checked?

A: Yes, I have. The cold combined with the salty sea wind is detrimental to teeth.

Q: How do you like life in Venice? Would you move there if you had the chance? And where?

A: Life in Venice is‚Ä¶ active. As long as I am needed here, moving cannot be my desire.

Comment: Raven, you have a very beautiful eye. (editor's note: we are talking about the picture for the day with Raven in the greeting post)

A: I hope both are.

Q: Please tell us which ruler, perhaps some famous king, you remember in a good way and why?

A: Just recently I told a witch that I enjoyed communicating with the current reigning Victoria. As for the past, there were many worthy rulers in it. And many unworthy ones.

Q: How did you meet Lucretia? And how strong is the friendship between you? Or is this information too personal?

A: We were introduced shortly before the Supreme Witch Fiore became a member of the Triumvirate. Her professionalism allowed us to become good colleagues, and later strengthen this bond with friendship. However, I can say something similar about Belogor. And before, I had the opportunity to find friendship with members of the Triumvirate.

Q: Raven! Would you like to become an ordinary person or give up magic completely, if you had such an opportunity?

A: Depends on the circumstances under which the opportunity would arise.

Q: Please tell us, how do you see the ideal date with the lady of your heart?

A: Such as will give her pleasure.

Q: We have already heard about your longevity. And in connection with this, I have a question. What is the most memorable moment in your life (a vivid flash of memory)? I will be glad if you tell me about 1 negative and 1 positive moment.

A: The length of my life allows me not to choose just one thing. And even two points would not be enough.

Q: Dear Raven, if we imagine that you managed to remove the mask, what would you eat first?

A: To begin with, I will drink a glass of water with a drop of red wine.

Q: If it is not a secret, please tell us about an interesting incident from your life.

A: Once I managed to take part in an exciting adventure. It was 1792, the Place de Gr√®ve was flooded with blood flowing from the blade of the guillotine, and one brave Englishman, bearing the name of the scarlet flower, was trying to save the aristocrats from an unenviable fate. By the way, Signor Nicoletti sometimes reminds me of this gentleman. Then I was lucky enough to help save several families and annoy citizen Chauvelin.

Q: Supreme Witcher, have you ever met Tadeusz Crowe? If so, what impression did you have of him?

A: I have not.

Q: I would really like to ask, have you heard anything about Joan of Arc? Perhaps you have met her in person? If not, I would be glad if you shared your opinion about this French heroine.

A: Of course, I have heard. However, I have not met her in person. Besides, her history is covered with such a layer of mystery that I will not evaluate it with the unequivocality of my opinion.

Q: Tell me, which era of the ones you lived through did you like the most? And which country? üí´

A: I value the development of the world, and each new century, in my opinion, is better than the previous one. However, the same applies to countries. In each one, you can find something you like and something you want to avoid.

Q: I wonder if you own a cold weapon? And if so, what kind? A sword? Heavy or light? Or a spear? Or maybe an ax?

A: I own many types of weapons, but I prefer not to use them.

Q: You have seen many countries in your life. Which countries do you like the most?

A: The answer is the same as in several questions before.

Q: Raven, designing ships is not the easiest thing to do. Is it a kind of meditation for you? Does such painstaking work really help you relax?

A: It is a passionate necessity.

Q: What is your favorite spell and why?

A: Many are non-verbal. Less words - more action.

Q: Supreme Witcher, what is your attitude to folklore? Lady Crow often turns to fairy tales and legends during her work. Do you think this approach is rational?

A: Folklore is a way of understanding the world and a connection with the unconscious essence that is in every person. It really can answer many questions.

Q: I am glad to see you in good health, Supreme Witcher. Conversations with you are so rare, which is why they are incredibly valuable. Let me ask you a few questions that torment my soul. 
1. Judging by your fame among the wise, you have not left your post for more than a century. Have you really not had the desire to retire, change your profession, find yourself in something new over the years? 
2. The second question follows from the previous one. Even the most righteous souls sometimes strive for power, however, with your capabilities, you have not tried to subjugate the will of people, to rule this world, or at least the country. Have such thoughts not visited your head? 

A:
1. have retired more than once. As it turned out, the weight of responsibility did not become less from this. As for new affairs, I had the chance to try many, and will inevitably have the chance again. 
2. The second answer follows from the previous one. Power is responsibility. And I know too well the feeling of its weight on my shoulders, and I do not need more. 

Q: You do not particularly hide your feelings for Esther Crow. Do you not see the point in hiding them at all or is it a matter of specific people? 

A: I do not hide my feelings in those cases and companies where it is appropriate and will not harm the reputation of Lady Crow.

Q: I am glad to welcome you, Supreme Witcher! Thank you for finding the time to satisfy our interest. In your life, you have crossed paths with quite a few world-famous knowers. Can you single out someone in particular? Perhaps you had extremely interesting conversations with someone that you recalled much later?

A: Count Saint-Germain was a truly interesting conversationalist.

Q: Do you miss your homeland, Scandinavia?

A: The homeland that I remember is no longer there.

Q: What melody would you use to describe your childhood?

A: Different.

Q: Please forgive my impudence. However, I think this is not the first time you have encountered such irrepressible curiosity.
We know that during the witch hunts you had to hide behind the image of an aristocrat whose face was covered in smallpox. How often did you have to invent such lies and were those around you willing to believe them? Didn't you ever get tired of them?

A: There were a lot of lies in those days. My favorite excuses were those that made me look like an eccentric weirdo in the eyes of others. Seriousness is not expected from such people, which means there is no need to worry about the discovery of your true intentions.

Q: How would you behave if a woman you care about suddenly started paying attention to another man? 

A: I wouldn't be happy. 

Q: If you could get rid of your curse one day, would you want to have a family, maybe children? 

A: It‚Äòs personal.

Q: How do you feel about pets? Would you get a cat? 

A: Yes.

Q: A year closer! How will you celebrate your mortality, if it comes, after all? 

A: The list of options is too long. I've had a lot of time to think it over. 

Q: Do you remember events from your life before you became immortal? Share with us the details of a particularly memorable incident? 

A: Perhaps someday you will have the opportunity to learn something similar. 

Q: Do you remember your appearance? 

A: Partially. 

Q: Dear Raven, do you prefer the sea or the mountains? Have you ever seen the Himalayas? 

A: The sea. Yes.

Q: Supreme Witcher, my thoughts are tormented by many questions, to which this artifact will most likely not be able to give answers due to the fact that the future is foggy (and spoiler-like), so I will ask some of the innocent ones: 
1. From the heights of the centuries lived, is there a feeling that everyone around is an inexperienced child? 
2. You always look great, what era's fashion is closest to you? 
3. How can I earn your respect? 

A:
1. No. Age is not equal to experience and, of course, is not equal to wisdom. The acquisition of both depends solely on the abilities and character of each person. 
2. Any, except for men's stockings with breeches. 
3. Depends on the circumstances.

Clarifying question: What about the codpiece? 

A: It can be covered with a frock coat.

Q: Were the negotiations with Germany that you spoke about during the naming of the seers successful?

A: They have been postponed.

Q: What do you think about the fact that Signorina Crow has some rather dubious acquaintances? Namely: Dario Bartholomew, Richard Blackwater, and Nikolai Lansky.

A: I would not call Richard Blackwater and Nikolai Lansky ""dubious acquaintances."" As for Dario Bartholomew, many participants in the current events know him.

Q: Have you ever been truly in love?

A: I have not allowed myself to be.

Q: Are there people you consider friends? Besides Belogor and Lucretia.

A: Yes.

Q: Supreme Witcher, what work assignments do you dislike the most, and which ones are like cracking nuts?

A: I am understanding of everything that does not concern meetings.

Q: What era's fashion do you like the most?

A: Current.

Q: Supreme Witcher, do you still believe in the Norse gods? What is your attitude toward Hecate?

A: Respectful.

Q: How long has it been since you last celebrated your birthday?

A: Never.

Q: Supreme Witcher, share what you dream of (besides the end of your life)?

A: About the world accepting the wise as equal members of society, without regard for past tragedies and feuds.

Q: Dear Raven, what wisdom would you share with the younger generation?

A: Don't listen to sarcastic old men.

Q: If you had a familiar, what do you think it would be? Perhaps you do have a familiar?

A: I haven't thought about it.

Q: Why didn't you heal Esther Crow yourself after she fell from the balcony at Antonioni's house?

A: I can't heal with magic.

Q: Tell me, do you have the ability to see things that others can't? Other people's familiars, for example?... Or maybe hear?

A: I have many interesting abilities.

Q: Why did only one strand of your hair turn grey? And please satisfy my curiosity, why?

A: Magic.

Q: Would you prefer tea or coffee?

A: Ale.

Q: Do you consider yourself a tactile person?

A: Until recently, I didn't.

Q: Supreme Witcher, I have a question that may seem too personal to you, but it is important not only to me, but also to a certain knower who cares about you. üòä Tell me, how would you like to die?

A: Without ruining my suit.

Q: Why do you think you have so many admirers?

A: I think it's because of my kindest and most comfortable character.

Q: Tell me, aren't you curious about who we all are, how we know so much about you, and why we ask these questions?

A: I've accepted the laws of convention. I don't need to know more.

Q: What is your typical working day in the Coven like when you don't have to investigate mysterious disappearances of magic? Do you like your job?

A: A typical day in the Coven is predictable. I like my job.

Q: We know that you have a fear of thunder and lightning. What causes this phobia? Maybe there was an event after which you developed this fear?

A: Yes.

Clarifying question: What was the incident, I take it, you won't tell me?

A: I don't want to.",4,1734878371.0,leagueofdreamers,3,0.84,False
1hjzono,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1hjzono/ill_never_regret_a_moment/,I‚Äôll never regret a moment ,"Sometimes I sit here and question if im crazy for everything I feel, do I feel too deeply, too often, am I simply too much? 

Love has always been the one thing in life that comes easy to me. I fall in love with life, and strangers everyday. The way someone sighs after a first sip of coffee in the morning, the way people laugh when they‚Äôre caught in the rain. I wake up early to watch the sunrise every day, enamoured by the way the sky is painted in hues of pink and orange, the birds start to sing, the neighbour‚Äôs rooster crowing. As if they‚Äôre singing, welcoming everyone to a new day. I fall in love with the way peoples eyes brighten when they talk about what set their soul on fire, the way they smile shyly as their face reddens when they are complimented. I fall in love with the gentlest moments, a soft embrace, fingertips grazing against skin, leaves dancing in the wind, the snow falling gently; leaving the world in silence. 

I fall in love when the ocean waves crash against the shore, a deafening sound you feel in your chest. It echos the feeling of your heart pounding, when a lover kisses your neck. The way the ocean kisses the shore, a gentle dance between lovers destined to meet, and go their separate ways over and over. I fall in love when I see the moon, the way she is in a constant state of change, beautiful no matter the space she takes up that night. Yet dearly missed when she cannot be found. I fall in love when I see the sun, the warmth of his rays reminding me of the gentle way you spoke to me. 

I feel love the most when I see children playing, laughing as they run away, but looking back to make sure their parents are never far behind. That‚Äôs the kind of love I felt with you. My inner child squealing with delight, she felt no fear when it was time to run. I still look back and wonder where you are, are you close behind? Then I remember, this fleeting moment we shared was never about a runner or a chaser. We both ran, like children having a race. 

Maybe the way I love you, the way I love life is absurd, is too much for some. I will never spend a moment regretting love I have felt and so freely given away, I will never regret holding a part of you in my heart. To love is the simplest thing we have to offer in this life, even when it doesn‚Äôt last, even when it has its complications it‚Äôs always worth it. 

We often as people hold onto our love so tightly, making sure we do not get hurt, that they are worthy of the love we have to offer. Yet where is the fun in that? To love unconditionally means to sacrifice our ego, our fears, our pain. We have to accept everything as it is, and love it anyway, completely and unapologetically. 

Maybe I am too much, but I could never love too much. ",3,1734878262.0,UnsentLettersRaw,0,0.8,False

I hope you all find yourselves fine as this sunday.

I've come here to share my story that hasn't finished yet, or atleast I hope so.

Since semester had begun last september in university, I noticed this girl from my class back then I didn't know what was calling my attention towards her but I was kinda focused on getting 'em grades than girls.

As semester is coming to an end and 1 month left I started to speak to her, baby steps, small questions, then I noticed one time she and other person talking about pets, I kinda got into the convo and she was very interested on my pets such name and other curiosities. This got me thinking maybe I should invest more.

I was starting to notice that she would efforlessly laught at my jokes, she would listen me very well turning her phone down, and turning her whole body towards me.

At this point I started to ask her bit of personal questions like do you play anything? And I found out that we got same interests, like we both had tried learning japanese, we both liked games, we both like computer science she mentioned that she wanted to persue that carrer. (We are taking Cybersecurity and Networks). 

# ______________________________________ TLDR  - (SKIP DETAILS)

By this time I was getting really interested on her so I was wondering how I should invite her out? I'm so shy  when it comes to these things... But an idea suddenly emerged. What about creating a program that simulates like an old letter, with some challanges that in order to read everything she has to uncypher? So I put my hands into work took me like 1 or 2 weeks to finish. The codes to read the rest of the letter was things that we both told eachother that we like. (Like japanese and cats). 

In the end of the program I said that I was interested to know her better, and invited her out to drink a hot coffee and check the city's xmas light and event.

I thought well this seems creative, unique way of making a old fashion way a bit more modern. heh I think I may be sometimes naive.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

So I sent the program last saturday 14th December, got so anxious idk I felt so stupid after clicking send but ok it is normal I thought. So next day no reply, monday no reply (noticed really really weird behavior of her and her group of friends, felt numb when I noticed that because I thought to myself I ducked up), next day no reply, I had lost all hope until I got a reply wendnesday night.

>Her reply (translated):

>Hello,   
  
Apologies for the delay. I saw you sent something, but I haven't had time to check it yet. As soon as I get it I'll tell you something, either here or via WhatsApp.  
I hope there is no problem and I apologize for keeping you waiting.   
Thank you anyway for sending it :D

  
All the behavior changed of her's, like she stopped saying good morning, her friend hesitating to handshake me and her sisters long stare during lunch, instead of sitting on the bench waiting for the teacher as they used to do for the past 3 or 4 months going around the building.

I'm not buying the ""but I haven't had time to check it yet"". I believe she already had seen it by this time.

So I believe either shes buying time to think, or shes unsure what to tell.

I've asked friends opinion and some of they told me that that message was a kind way of rejection which maybe but I hardly believe because she would have only ignored it or told me no.

Aus üçÉf20. ,"This post is mostly directed at aus persons and their experiences with medicinal marijuana because I can‚Äôt post on the actual group due to low karma :,) please bare with me because I do in fact need to know if I‚Äôm being too anxious / overreacting / overthinking.  

Hello everyone üéÑ
I‚Äôve been smoking non medical for a year + now due to its effectiveness on my mental health (Odd anxiety and insomnia) 

For those wondering odd otherwise known as oppositional defiance disorder is something I‚Äôve struggled with since I was really young mostly I‚Äôd say because of being in such an explosive household, but it causes me to have trouble regulating emotions and I can be on edge/hyper sensitive to irritability/ snappy unnecessary aggression in tone etc and as a kid they wanted to put me on ridalin (I think that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs spelt?) but my mother was against it for reasons I won‚Äôt argue with. 

My anxiety isn‚Äôt horrible, so there‚Äôs 0 chance of medicinal causing paranoia or any of those symptoms in fact it‚Äôd be negative by far because it‚Äôs legal. But on a day to day basis no my anxiety isn‚Äôt horrible, I myself am more agoraphobic and cannot handle leaving my house, taking out the rubbish in my front yard is anxiety inducing enough to me as snowflakey as it may sound. So when I have some to smoke I feel a lot more comfortable and less stress and anxious going out. 

I have had a long history of living in a loud chaotic environment and was basically running on fight or flight/adrenaline my whole childhood and it‚Äôs now become a permanent part of my brain to not be able to ‚Äúfeel safe‚Äù and be able to sleep till like 4am if I‚Äôm lucky it‚Äôs not too bad otherwise I can easily pull a 24hr shift without sleep. I have tried melatonin I‚Äôve tried seroquel/quiatepine for it‚Äôs sleep affects and still nothing. As a kid the doctor suggested having coffee before sleep to help but it felt like an easy telling placebo if that makes sense. So after years of not being able to sleep I tried marijuana and had amazing effects of it with both my mental and physical health due to getting that sleep I‚Äôm needing! I would also like to add my sleep is like this with a full time on my feet job so sadly no I don‚Äôt need to just get out of the house I wish it was that simple. 

My question here today is;
How did you do your appointment? What type of questions do they ask? And what do I tell them?

A lot of my past trial and error with sleep such as seroquel/quiatepine and melatonin weren‚Äôt over the counter but by family with similar issues as I (I‚Äôm fully aware seroquel is an antipsychotic). However none of them worked, I then decided to try marijuana and it is the only thing that helps me. I don‚Äôt get a ‚Äúhahaha hehehe‚Äù high but I just get a relaxed and at peace feeling instead of constant internal screaming, I‚Äôve tried medicinal and I‚Äôve had no negative effects but I would like to get my own script rather than buy illegally. I‚Äôm very nervous about an appointment and my anxiety is the only thing making me put it off because I‚Äôm so scared of being judged and declined for something that truly helps me and makes life easier to get by. 
I plan on going through easy kind as I know of people who‚Äôve had a good experience with them, yes I know ppl who have done the appointment but I just really need others perspectives for advice sorry for the long post I just wanted to be upfront and honest.

First, the party is invited to the gnome village and are told the fastest way to travel there is by using one of their ""jump-stations"". The party arrives at the jump-station in the morning. It is a large wooden board placed on a hill, with a big red X painted on it. A tired gnome wizard arrives; he clearly works there. He has just had his morning coffee and asks if the party is ready. The party is led to believe they will be teleported with magic. But instead, the wizard just pulls a level and the board, which is turned out is mounted on a huge catapult, just launches them into the air. The party flies through the air, headed towards something that looks like a village. Before they hit the ground, the gnome wizard uses feather fall. For him this is just another Monday, and as the party lands in a clearly well-used pile of pillows, the gnome remarks the mechanism has a mortality rate of less then 5%.

The village is built on a series of platforms along a mountain side. To travel among the platforms, or deliver mail and parcels, the population uses more smaller catapults. It is a primarily catapult-based economy. The village also develops dynamite, and dynamite accessories.

The village has a dark secret though, they are working in cahoots with the evil emperor of Neverwinter, who has  offered to sponsor their catapult enterprises by building a huge catapult travel station in the center of Neverwinter. The first of it's kind outside the gnome world. It would lead directly to the gnome village, which in turn would have a corresponding jump station leading back to Neverwinter. This would rapidly place the gnome village in the center of the technological and economic arena.

Anyways, I won't end up using it in my campaign, but I figured someone else might get some fun out of it.",1,1734877401.0,DnD,0,1.0,False

I started coding back when compiling a program meant you could go grab a cup of coffee (or two) before it finished. I‚Äôve always loved the creative side of building software, and I‚Äôm fortunate enough to make a decent living doing it. But recently, I realized that my perspective might be stuck in a comfortable bubble, disconnected from what newer folks in the field are experiencing.

I had a few interactions with younger devs‚Äîpeople just trying to break into engineering‚Äîand it really shook up my assumptions. For the longest time, I saw ‚Äúengineer‚Äù as this almost elite profession: work hard, learn the ropes, get hired, and eventually enjoy a decent salary. That path worked out for me, so I just assumed it was the same for everyone else. Clearly, that‚Äôs not true anymore. Some folks are hustling non-stop just to survive, and getting a foot in the door is tougher than ever in certain regions.

I also got into a heated Reddit discussion about open source recently‚Äîtrying to share the joy I‚Äôve always found in contributing to projects ‚Äújust for fun.‚Äù A lot of people pushed back, saying that giving away your time for free is a luxury not everyone can afford. It never occurred to me that for some folks,¬†*every*¬†moment has to be monetized just to pay rent. That mindset shift was a wake-up call.

These experiences made me wonder:

‚Ä¢¬†**Is it really harder to land that first coding job now, or am I just not seeing how competitive the field has become?**

‚Ä¢¬†**Is open source (or any kind of ‚Äúhobby coding‚Äù) still a valuable stepping stone‚Äîor is it just a privilege for those who can afford to work for free?**

‚Ä¢¬†**Does the job market differ drastically depending on where you live (U.S., Europe, Asia, etc.)?**

I manage a team of about 40 engineers, and I‚Äôve hired hundreds of people over the years. I‚Äôd love to know what other hiring managers or senior devs are seeing in today‚Äôs market. Are we saturated with too many devs chasing too few positions, or are there still opportunities for those who show real passion and skill?

But more importantly, I‚Äôm hoping to hear from you if you‚Äôre relatively new to this field.

‚Ä¢¬†**How are you learning?**¬†(Bootcamp, college, self-taught, etc.)

‚Ä¢¬†**What‚Äôs your biggest struggle right now?**¬†Finding that first gig? Balancing your free time with paid projects? Feeling pressured to ‚Äúmonetize every minute‚Äù?

‚Ä¢¬†**Has your perception of software engineering changed since you started?**

I genuinely want to understand how the industry feels from where you‚Äôre standing‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre trying to make a start in an unpredictable economy. Do you still believe software engineering is a good career path, or do you see it differently?

Thanks for reading my long ramble. I‚Äôm hoping this post can spark some real discussion about the state of engineering today‚Äîboth the good and the bad. I‚Äôd love to hear your stories, struggles, successes, or any advice you might have. Let‚Äôs learn from each other and maybe bridge the gap between ‚Äúold-timers‚Äù like me and the new generation forging their own paths.

A couple of things I need to vent about:

1. Some customers were still deciding and not ready to order. They were standing a few meters away from the counter, talking to each other or looking at the menu. I was at the cash register, ready to take their order. Then my supervisor started yelling: ""Take the customer's order! Take the customer's order!""
2. Some customers were talking on the phone or chatting with their friends *a lot* while ordering or taking forever to decide what to get. Then the supervisor would ask, ""Are you done with the order? Faster!""
3. During slow hours, sometimes there are no customers at all. The counters are clean, and coffee and tea are all prepped and timed. Once, I stood there for like 3 seconds to look around and think about what I should do next, and she asked: ""Why are you standing there? Do something!""
4. During the evening shift, someone has to take out the garbage, and it‚Äôs usually me.

Now, in order to keep your job, you jump in the shower, puke a couple times on your own feet, get dressed, drive to work late and hungover as shit, fuck up all day, almost lose your job because they know whats up and demand you seek help or be terminated. You agree to get the ball rolling as soon as you get home. Twelve hours later, when you're feeling a lot better, you decide, because you're a self absorbed addict, that this was all a victory in some deranged sense, and get back to drinking that very evening. The boss calls you to make sure you have your recovery ducks in a row and can tell you're drunk. ""We're gonna have to sever ties, (Your name here).

When was the beginning? At somepoint, everything shifted so much that what was originally a coffee mixed drink is now just a milkshake. Let's take the original Dunkin Donuts Coffee Coolata, I belive now it's called a coffee freeze, frappe or some bullshit.

This thing was a blended drink in the summer you could have that cooled you down, and although pumped with sugar, still tasted like coffee. Even that had too much sugar but it was simple, because it had coffee and you could taste it. Then I belive Starbucks came out with Frappuccinos and that's when all hell broke loose. It wasn'tovernight, but as they marketed different varieties of this crap they slowly became non-coffee drinks, now it's just ridiculous. There are things like the new ""Chestnut Praline Latte"" which I think I had as an ice-cream flavor one or twice in my life, I don't even know what it tastes like but I can get it as a ""coffee"". I think I saw an olive oil version last year. What the hell?

 ... It ain't  coffee, it's a few pumps of concentrated coffee (if you don't get a cream version) sugar adhesive, sugar flavoring, more sugar toppings, and more milk than coffee. It's ice-cream, a milkshake, or a Sundae with coffee flavoring, not coffee.

The other reason why I say this is because of the amount of  poor quality destinations to buy coffee when I travel. Americans, if really drinking coffee, general drink a drip coffee. Especially for older men while younger generations may tend toward lattes but there's definitely a lot of guys who get cold brew. That being said, when traveling I'd stop with my gf to get a bagel and coffee - they even advertised ""coffee"" and when you walk in there's two cannisters to pump it yourself near ketchup and salt packages. What a disgrace! That is not a true appreciation  of coffee. Minimally, they'd at least have to rotate one hot urn or pot, but they don't. It sits there all day and is not fresh. How could people really like coffee if they allow this? It's too frequent.

Also, I avoided saying cafe because they're not, but there are too many cafes that have 160z of milk with just two shots of espresso. A good quality espresso drink (like latte or cappuccino) should be 8oz max. Anything beyond that is a bastardization from Starbucks. You should want to taste both the coffee and the milk. Otherwise, once you get a venti the coffee is milked-down. If this what your drinking in the morning I can't imagine how you start the day with a pot of milk to the intestines.

I'll give kudos to dunkin where I belive most of their clientele actually get coffee, but they still have tried some of the whacky shit to stay relevant. Thankfully, some portion of the population likes coffee. But even most of these cups of coffee have a shit ton of milk and sugar.

I'll also give kudos to coffee shops near Universities (non-franchise) or high walkable areas with tourists (franchise, like blue bottle) that have what I'm calling ""European style"" coffee - ""small"" lattes, likely made by a La Marzocco espresso machine, no energy drinks, and maybe maybe one blended drink that no body gets. Overall, it's legit coffee.

I'm not gate keeping, I want everyone to enjoy whatever they want. I say this as someone who loves European style coffee and would love to open a coffee shop, but I know, I might need to consider bastardizing what I love depending on where I live. That being said, drink what you want, just brush your teeth.",0,1734876744.0,unpopularopinion,29,0.38,False
