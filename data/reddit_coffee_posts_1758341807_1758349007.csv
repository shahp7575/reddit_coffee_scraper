We'll be going 2 weeks: 

* first weekend in Santorini: feels like a must see, even if over touristy
* first week will be working ¬±6 hours per day so we settled on Paros
* second week enjoying so will spend 8 days on Naxos

For the first week, as mentioned we'll be working a few hours a day, so the goal is to find a nice spot on a beach, being able to go for a run in the morning or even a swim if we're feeling frisky, and enjoy nice restaurants in the evening. We're not party people, more enjoying good food, good coffee, and a book people :D. 

I've listed a few hotels around Naoussa, but I'm a bit taken aback by the prices to be honest, even in october... Also quite a few people mention it's Mykonos lite, which is definitely not the vibe we're going for (I don't mind enjoying a drink, but definitely don't need a party scene, especially since we'll be working).

Mira's laugh rang out, loud and familiar. Mira, his ex, the owner of the gym, the one he begged me never to approach her.","# Just after eleven o'clock, I went to the gym to find my boyfriend. Two voices. Mira's laugh rang out, loud and familiar. Mira, his ex, the owner of the gym, the one he begged me never to approach her.

I paused just outside the door.

""You never answered me. What's the deal with that chubby girl? The one who follows you around like a stray?""

I froze.

I wasn't breathing. I wasn't alive.

Rider chuckled‚Äîchuckled. ""She's no one, Mira. Just a client. A girl who shows up every time I smile at her. Honestly? She seems desperate. It's like... she thinks being pitiful is cute.""

""She always looks like she's about to cry,"" Mira scoffed. ""Like she's trying to puppy-dog-eye her way into your bed.""

""She's a charity case,"" he said, voice low but not low enough.

Each word peeled another layer off my skin. My breath turned jagged, my heart a frantic animal in my chest.

And maybe, just maybe, I was finally ready to be wanted.

Oh, How wrong was I. He will only be another life lesson.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I never thought I would love the gym.

Yet, here I am‚Äîone year in, stronger, more confident, and finally seeing a reflection I don't shy away from. The girl who once wore oversized sweaters to disappear now wears fitted leggings and tank tops without flinching. The girl who used to lower her gaze in mirrors now meets her own eyes head-on, silently acknowledging how far she has come.

And it's all because of him.

Rider.

My coach. My friend. My secret.

It started with simple encouragement‚Äîa warm smile after a tough set, the way he always seemed to notice when I needed a push. He was effortless, charming without trying, and I had fallen‚Äîhard.

There was a time, early in our friendship, when he caught me struggling with a deadlift.

""You're thinking too much, December. The weight doesn't control you. You control it.""

I had rolled my eyes. ""Sounds like a terrible motivational poster.""

""Maybe,"" he'd grinned, ""but I believe it.""

And somehow, I started believing it too‚Äînot just about the weights but about myself.

Then one night, I had stayed late at the gym. The world outside was dark and quiet. It had just been the two of us‚Äîlike it so often was. I had been sitting on one of the benches, catching my breath, when he sat beside me.

""I've been thinking about something.""

I turned to him, surprised by the softness in his voice. ""Yeah?""

Rider hesitated, rubbing the back of his neck, then exhaled. ""I like you, December. And not just in a 'you're my client' way. In a 'let me take you out' kind of way.""

My heart nearly exploded.

""Wait‚Äîwhat?""

He laughed. ""is that a good what, a happy what, or what-the-he1l What?""

""No,"" I rushed out, warmth rushing to my cheeks. ""it is a ...wow what""

""Really? I thought I couldn't have been more obvious"" he teased.

""Well you seemed nice to everyone,"" I lied.

""There is nice professional and nice flirty, and I was constantly flirting with you but yeah I think I needed to be straightforward. I really like you Dec. Seeing you and talking to you are the highlight of my day.""

I had been floating. I wanted to say yes a million times over. And then he added, ""But... it has to be a secret. For now."" Just like that, the moment cracked.

""A secret?""

""I just started here, Dec. It wouldn't look great if I immediately started dating a client. Give me time. It's temporary, I promise.""

I had been disappointed, but when he took my hands, when he looked at me with those steady, unwavering eyes and said, ""I just want you, December,"" I had believed him.

So, I agreed.

And for eight months, he had made me feel like the only woman in the world.

Like every Tuesday, I met my closest friends for brunch at our favorite caf√©. The place smelled of cinnamon and freshly brewed coffee, a cozy warmth against the chill of late autumn outside. May, October, and June were already there, the table cluttered with pastries and half-empty mugs.

""So, Dec,"" May said, stirring her latte with a knowing smirk. ""It's been a year since you started working out, right?""

""Yeah,"" I nodded, cutting into my avocado toast.

""And you look incredible,"" June added, eyeing me with approval. ""Seriously, you're glowing.""

I laughed, tucking a loose strand of auburn hair behind my ear. ""I just feel... better. Stronger.""

""And more confident,"" October noted. ""You've been dressing differently too. Fitted tops, skirts. You're showing off, girl.""

I felt my cheeks warm. ""I guess I just finally feel comfortable in my own skin.""

""But the real question is,"" May leaned in conspiratorially, ""has someone noticed?""

I nearly choked on my coffee.

June's eyes widened. ""Wait. Has someone noticed?""

October narrowed her eyes. ""You have that look. You're totally seeing someone, aren't you?""

I forced a casual shrug. ""I'm... just focusing on myself right now.""

""Uh-huh,"" May rolled her eyes. ""You suck at lying, you know that?""

""Leave her alone,"" June laughed. ""If there's a guy, she'll tell us when she's ready.""

I offered her a grateful smile, but guilt gnawed at me. I wished I could tell them‚Äîabout Rider, about the stolen moments, about how he made me feel like the most beautiful woman in the world.

But secrets had become part of our love story.

And for now, I had to keep it that way.

By the time I arrived at River Heights Elementary, the cool morning air had faded into a crisp, sunny afternoon. Teaching had always been my passion, but since my confidence had grown, I noticed a change in how I carried myself in the classroom.

My students adored me‚Äîespecially the way I made lessons fun.

During science class, one of my third graders, Emily, tugged on my sleeve.

""Ms. December, do you have a boyfriend?""

I blinked, startled. ""What?""

""Miss Parker does,"" Emily declared. ""I heard her talking about him. And you're really pretty, so you should have one too.""

I chuckled, smoothing down Emily's braids. ""Well, thank you, sweetheart. But not having a boyfriend doesn't mean someone isn't happy, okay?""

Emily thought about it. ""But do you have one?""

I hesitated before laughing. ""Alright, back to science. Who can tell me why leaves change color?""

As the class erupted into answers, I shook my head, amusement dancing in my eyes.

If only Emily knew.

After a long day at work, I let out a breath as I unlocked my apartment door, expecting the usual quiet. But the moment I stepped inside, the scent of garlic and rosemary filled the air.

My heart skipped.

There he was‚ÄîRider‚Äîstanding at my stove, his broad back to me, stirring something in a pan. A soft candle flickered on the dining table, next to two plates already set out.

He turned, smiling that easy, breathtaking smile.

""Happy eight months, December.""

I melted.

He walked toward me, k1ssed me softly, and just like that, all my nerves disappeared.

And maybe it was the warmth in the room, the candlelight flickering on the table, or just the simple fact that I knew this was love‚Äîreal, undeniable love‚Äîbut I looked at him and said it.

""I love you.""

He stilled.

For a heartbeat, I thought maybe he hadn't heard me. Then, slowly, he smiled.

And k1ssed my forehead.

""You're adorable.""

My stomach dropped.

My breath caught in my throat.

That was not what I had expected.

Not I love you too. Not even a k1ss. Just... adorable.

My heart pounded as he turned back to the stove, humming like nothing had happened, while I stood there‚Äîshocked, hurt, and so confused.

Because for the first time in eight months, I wasn't sure if he really meant it when he said he wanted me.

And for the first time in months, I had a terrible feeling this wasn't going to end well.

Dinner should have felt warm. Familiar. Comfortable.

But it didn't.

Rider sat across from me, animated and bright-eyed as he talked about his new clients at the gym. A guy training for his first triathlon. A woman who just had her second baby and was trying to get her strength back. He smiled when he spoke about them, his hands moving with excitement. He even mentioned something funny his mom texted earlier in the day‚Äîsomething about his dad pretending to forget their anniversary, like it was a family tradition.

He laughed. I smiled.

He asked about my day, my students, if I'd seen any of ""the girls"" lately‚ÄîMay, June, October. I answered him, politely, carefully.

But I felt far away.

Not once did he mention what I said last night. Not one word about it.

I kept wondering if he heard me at all. Or if he just filed it away in some box labeled ""Too Soon"" or ""Not Worth Noticing.""

And if he did notice the quiet in my voice, or the way my smile never quite reached my eyes... he didn't let on.

After we ate, I cleaned up while he scrolled through his phone, occasionally reading me things he thought were funny. I nodded along. I laughed where I was supposed to. But inside?

I was just... tired.

When it was time for bed, I retreated into the bathroom and closed the door like it was armor. I took my time with my skincare routine, methodically patting creams and serums into my skin‚Äîlayer after layer, as if they could fix what was unraveling beneath the surface.

I stared into the mirror. My reflection looked calm, composed. But my eyes gave me away.

I had told him I loved him. And he had k1ssed my forehead. Said I was ""adorable."" Like a puppy. Or a child. Not a woman. Not his woman. It was the first time in my entire life I'd ever said ""I love you"" to a man. And I'd meant it with every trembling, terrified part of me. No man had ever said those words to me. Not even my father. My mom had. So many times. But somehow, even all of hers together didn't feel like enough to fill this ache.

When I finally walked back into the bedroom, he was already under the covers, shirtless, hair tousled like he belonged in some kind of cologne ad. He looked over and smiled that lazy, beautiful smile.

""I've missed sleeping next to you,"" he said. I forced a nod. ""I'm really tired.""

""That's okay, come here"" he said easily.

He pulled me into his arms, and I let him. His warmth wrapped around me, and for a second I wished it could sink into my bones and make me feel whole again. But it didn't. He whispered, ""Sweet dreams."" And just like that, he fell asleep. I stayed very still.

Very quiet.

And I cried.

Not loud, not broken‚Äîjust silent, steady tears that soaked into his arm and the pillow, invisible to him but loud enough in my own chest to feel like thunder.

I imagined myself beautiful. Not just pretty. Not ""adorable."" But undeniable. A woman who could be loved fully and fearlessly. I imagined a version of myself who didn't have to hide how badly she wanted to be chosen. And then I lay there in the dark beside a man I loved. A man who maybe didn't love me back. And I told myself over and over: ""Don't wake him. Don't let him see you like this. Just hold on a little longer.""

I woke up with swollen eyes. The kind that told the truth before I could open my mouth. Rider was still asleep, the room bathed in that soft Wednesday morning glow we used to love. His day off. My late start. We were supposed to work out together, maybe grab breakfast after‚Äîour little tradition.

But today? I couldn't pretend. Not after last night. Not after the hour I spent curled next to him, silently crying into his chest, while he dreamt peacefully beside me. I slipped out of bed, grateful‚Äîso grateful‚Äîthat he was a heavy sleeper. The shower helped clear my head but not the ache in my chest. When I got out and caught my reflection, I stopped. My eyes were puffy and red-rimmed, cheeks dull, lips pressed in tight. And then I saw everything else.

The soft belly that refused to flatten, the stretch in my arms no matter how many sets I lifted, the skin around my neck that I swore looked older every morning.

No wonder I was still a secret.

I got dressed quickly, grabbed my bag, and left without a sound.

May's art studio was nestled in the corner of a converted warehouse, one of those cozy creative spaces that always smelled like acrylic paint and lavender candles. She practically lived there. It wasn't even 8 a.m., but I knew she'd be there‚Äîprobably barefoot, wild-haired, with a paintbrush behind her ear.

Sure enough, she answered the door in paint-splattered pajamas, blinking like she forgot what time of day it was.

""Is it Thursday?"" she mumbled.

""Wednesday.""

""d@mn. Come in.""

I stepped inside, and the familiar chaos of May's world wrapped around me like a hug. Stretched canvases leaned against every wall. Half-finished paintings and open jars of paint cluttered every surface. Music hummed low from a speaker in the corner, something French and soft. We didn't say anything at first. She just handed me a chipped black mug filled with bitter coffee and sat cross-legged on the floor, working on a portrait of a sleeping cat.

""You okay?"" she asked eventually. Not like a demand. More like a nudge.

I stared into my mug, fingers wrapped tight around the warmth.

""Do you think... do you think I'll ever be attractive enough to be loved by a man?""

She didn't gasp or freeze. She just sighed.

""I knew something was going on,"" she said gently. ""I've been waiting for you to talk. I respect that you didn't want to. But if it's about a guy..."" She looked up at me, paint streaked across her cheek. ""He's a d@mn fool.""

I swallowed hard.

""No. No one called me ugly. He just... he doesn't love me back.""

I felt the tears building again. ""Please don't ask me to explain more.""

She took another breath, softer this time.

""Okay. So maybe he doesn't love you. Not yet. Maybe not ever. But what makes you think that has anything to do with your looks?""

I didn't answer.

""I wish you could see yourself the way I see you,"" she whispered.

And then she smiled, eyes lighting up like only May's could.

""Actually... you can. I'm going to paint you. Like one of those French models.""

I blinked. ""Wait, what?""

""I'm serious. I want to paint you. I want you to see the softness in your collarbone, the curve of your shoulders, the way your eyes hold entire galaxies when you're not trying to hide.""

""...You've lost your mind if you think I'm going to pose n-de for you.""

She laughed, full and unbothered.

""Who said anything about n-de? I meant clothed. Mostly."" She winked. ""Unless you want to go full 'Titanic,' in which case, I'll get my charcoal pencils."" Despite myself, I laughed too. A real laugh‚Äîsharp and sudden and slightly watery. Maybe I wasn't ready to be loved. But maybe I was ready to be seen.

And May?

She saw me more clearly than I saw myself.

Here‚Äôs a¬†**complete breakdown of winter products people recommend for 2025**¬† with reasons why they matter and how Reddit users say they help.

# ¬†1. Heating & Warmth

* **Energy-Efficient Space Heaters**¬†‚Äì Ceramic heaters and oil-filled radiators are trending because they use less power while still heating rooms evenly. Redditors note that newer 2025 models come with¬†**smart timers and tip-over protection**, making them safer.
* **Smart Thermostats (Nest, Ecobee)**¬†‚Äì These help cut energy bills by learning your habits. Many in r/HomeImprovement say they pay for themselves within one season.
* **Electric Heated Blankets & Mattress Pads**¬†‚Äì Not only cozy, but energy-saving since you can heat yourself instead of the whole house. Dual-zone controls (each side of the bed set differently) are a big upgrade in 2025 models.

# ¬†2. Winter Wear & Personal Care

* **Insulated Waterproof Boots**¬†‚Äì Columbia, Sorel, and Timberland are the most mentioned. Redditors say waterproofing is critical for snowy commutes.
* **Heated Gloves & Rechargeable Hand Warmers**¬†‚Äì Commuters, delivery drivers, and even skiers rave about these. 2025 rechargeable models last up to 12 hours per charge.
* **Moisturizing Creams & Lip Balms**¬†‚Äì Winter skin care isn‚Äôt just cosmetic ‚Äî cracked skin and lips are painful. Aquaphor, CeraVe, and Burt‚Äôs Bees get consistent shoutouts.

# ¬†3. Home Protection & Safety

* **Snow Blowers & Electric Shovels**¬†‚Äì Cordless battery-powered snow blowers (like EGO and Greenworks) are huge in 2025 because they avoid gas maintenance.
* **Ice Melt & Traction Mats**¬†‚Äì Prevent falls on porches and driveways. Redditors often recommend¬†**pet-safe ice melt**¬†to protect dogs‚Äô paws.
* **Weatherproofing Kits**¬†‚Äì Window insulation film, draft stoppers, and pipe wraps are considered low-cost must-haves. A single $20 kit can save you hundreds in heating.

# ¬†4. Lifestyle & Comfort Upgrades

* **Light Therapy Lamps**¬†‚Äì Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) discussions pop up every winter. In 2025, full-spectrum lamps are trending for morning routines.
* **Humidifiers**¬†‚Äì Dry air leads to nosebleeds, poor sleep, and static electricity. Redditors prefer ultrasonic humidifiers with¬†**auto shut-off**.
* **Smart Kettles & Heated Mugs**¬†‚Äì For tea, coffee, or cocoa lovers, these are considered luxury upgrades. Ember heated mugs are often mentioned in r/BuyItForLife as ‚Äúworth it.‚Äù

# ¬†5. Car & Travel Essentials

* **Portable Jump Starters**¬†‚Äì Winter battery failure is common. Compact lithium-ion jump starters are now small enough to fit in a glove box.
* **Windshield De-Icers & Covers**¬†‚Äì Save time in the mornings. Many Reddit users swear by alcohol-based sprays that clear ice in seconds.
* **All-Weather Floor Mats**¬†‚Äì Protect car interiors from slush, salt, and mud. WeatherTech and Husky Liners are the most upvoted options.

# ¬†6. Emergency & Preparedness

* **Backup Power Banks & Generators**¬†‚Äì With ice storms causing outages, Redditors strongly recommend portable battery packs or even solar-powered generators.
* **Flashlights & Headlamps**¬†‚Äì LED rechargeable ones last much longer and are considered essential for both home and car emergency kits.
* **Non-Perishable Food & Water Storage**¬†‚Äì Cans, instant meals, and bottled water often come up in preparedness threads.

The¬†**winter products you need in 2025**¬†aren‚Äôt just about staying warm -  they‚Äôre about¬†**safety, efficiency, and comfort**.

Redditors consistently highlight:

1. Heat smart, not wasteful.
2. Keep your skin and body protected.
3. Winterize your home and car.
4. Be ready for storms and outages.

1nlq69k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1nlq69k/how_can_i_recreate_albert_heijns_halfvolle_koffie/,How can I recreate Albert Heijn‚Äôs halfvolle koffie melk (Dutch coffee milk) at home? Seeking recipe/technique,"Hi everyone,

  
I recently tried the¬†halfvolle koffie melk¬†from Albert Heijn and I really liked the taste so much, that I drank the plain milk from the little glass bottles as a treat in itself. I really like that it's smooth and just a little sweet and that it's just a little thicker than normal milk. I'm not in the Netherlands anymore, so I wanted to recreate this at my home (India). However, there are recipes using this milk, but no recipes to make the milk itself.

  
I've tried evaporated milk, but nothing gives the same texture or taste as the one from AH. I can‚Äôt find a recipe/ instruction to make this anywhere and I desperately want to make something as close as possible at home. How do you get that perfectly mild, creamy (but not heavy) taste and slight sweetness without adding sugar?

  
This is the exact product I am referring to: [https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi1101/ah-halfvolle-koffiemelk](https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi1101/ah-halfvolle-koffiemelk)

If anyone has an exact recipe, close copycat, or even just solid guesses and techniques, I‚Äôd be super grateful!  
  
Below is the official ingredients and nutrition list:  
Halfvolle melk (half-skimmed milk), stabiliser (E339, E407)  
Gesteriliseerd/Ge√´vaporeerd (sterilized & evaporated)  
4‚Äì4.5% fat, 20% milk solids, no added sugar  
Texture is thicker/creamier than ordinary milk but still pours easily

Thanks in advance!

1nlq63v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nlq63v/the_house_next_door/,The House Next Door,"I recently just moved on a quiet suburb in Upstate New York after I accepted a job in a nearby city. It was a busy day of moving for me, like me carrying several boxes in my home, some of the furniture, which, as you know, is incredibly heavy, and also a pain since I only have myself to lift it. By the time I finished moving everything in place, I just decided to crash down the couch. My back just ached in exhaustion, my eyes just drooping down to the point, I just want to shut my eyes. Then again, my stomach needed something to eat at the moment after moving so many of my stuff into the house. I sat down and pour myself a glass of coffee and sat down at my newly set table, facing the front porch. I took my supper as I take in on this new neighborhood I'm going to probably live in for the next couple of years in my life.

Across my street, there was this house; a small house, looks like your typical house that you see in a quiet suburb, small, drab coloured, absolutely nothing remarkable about it. The windows are completely shut, with the curtains extended wide open for me to not see anything through the house. The porch just by the front door looked unremarkable, with 2 chairs and a small table standing on top of it's wooden floors. The garage has it's white shutters closed, so I can't see what is inside this garage. Overall, the front facade of this house is unremarkable, honestly, I don't even know why I even mentioned anything about this house, there is nothing that is out of the ordinary, or anything that tells the entire neighborhood the house failed the HOA or anything; it's just a small house that many people will pass by or probably peek really quick and move on. That was not the reason I mentioned this house however, as I will tell my story about this strange house in front of me.

During daytime, it was an unremarkable house, it's your typical house in your small community suburb that many people will overlook, but during the night, it was different. During the dead times of midnight, when I was on my bedroom, again, one of the windows is facing the house just across the street, something weird happens there. During the first night, after I finally finished moving, one man began to walk on the porch; the man was wearing a white sweater and a matching coloured sweatpants. The man was knocking on the door, and eventually twists the door knob and enter the house. I could get a slight glimpse of what is inside, however, all I saw was just black, and nothing else, almost as if the place has no lighting inside. Eventually that man leaves after around 40 minutes, but something was different; the man was walking down the steps, moving in a way that hints that he was drunk or high or something. He walked down the street once more and left the house stumbling; I assume it was some sort of a crack den that no one told me or maybe there's some secret party that I don't know about, but, this house doesn't scream anything that it's a crack house nor it looked rowdy, if anything, it looked pristine, the paint has no wear, no crack on the walls, the lawn was short and trimmed, I don't think this is a crack house.

The second night is when everything get a bit more strange, nothing terrifying, but just... Odd. I was laying down at my bed looking at my phone, and as I veered through the window with my curtain closed, I got a glimpse of 2 red lights moving towards the house, stopped, and eventually shut off; a car stopped by the house and parked probably at the driveway. I ignored what is happening on that house, there was just complete silence on what is on the outside. Only the sound of my fan was the only thing I've heard during that night I decided to pay attention to the house. Suddenly, I've heard some faint banging noise, coming in front of me. I stood up from my bed, looking by the curtains. The last thing I saw was the same 2 red lights turned on and I heard tires screeching loudly as they seemingly reversed and left seemingly in a hurry. I thought it was nothing, but at the same time, I am convinced there is something off about this house I was residing in, something weird is going on in that house; I don't even know what I just heard over there that send whoever drove that car leaving in a hurry, it was all so strange.

Perhaps the weirdest moment I have with that house so far however, is around by the 5th night. For the past 2 nights, there was just silence, no activity on what is happening inside that house across the street, no random person entering the home or weird noises that jolts me awake on bed. It was this night however, I probably have more questions than answers. I was about to sleep by the night on my bed, now my curtains is opened just enough to get a good view of most of the house's front facade, but the street next to it is covered with the linen of the curtain. Around 1 AM in the morning, i was about to shut my eyes until I start seeing 2 cars parked by the front door of the house; this one is interesting, before it was just a random cars like the second night being some sort of a basic car, but these 2 vehicles looked like SUVs, both colored in black. I watched in that tiny slit of the curtain as several men wearing black getup with a couple of people wearing white entered the home, with 2 of these men standing by the door. Around 20 minutes or maybe 30 minutes, I watched as 2 bright white lights shine in front of my window. I couldn't get a good look of what is in front, but briefly, I think I saw a white van pulled out of the driveway and eventually, the people who left their SUVs before entered their vehicles and left the scene. 

Now I have no explanation what exactly is this supposed to be. Normally I wouldn't ask what could it possibly be, but, what exactly just happened in that house? The first night is some guy entered like normal, and then exited the house, looking terrible. The second night, there something that could've happened in there that explained why they seemingly just rushed out of there. But the fifth night is what got me; I know I barely saw anything that give me anything concrete, but I saw what seems to be several men, definitely not just some random members of a gang drove by the house or some partygoers who just entered the house, and eventually leave with a van out of that garage. Now that I thought of it, I have never seen anyone else leave the place except maybe the man in the white sweater, the guy in his car, or even the group of men in their inconspicuous vehicles, and that van was the only thing that left out of that house, not once I saw anything else leave that place. I'm going to keep an eye out of that house and see if there is something else noteworthy, or even perhaps get a closer look like it's some sort of expose of something secret, I'll update if something come up.

This past year he kept pressuring me to move in with him earlier than planned and help support him through college (emotionally not financially) and I ended up caving in and agreeing. Everything went smoothly and soon enough we‚Äôve been living together this past month. Now I come from a family who is extremely close and moving away from them was extremely difficult and I expressed to my fiance that I may become a little depressed and to just be patient with me and give me a little extra support especially the first few months. Within a week of moving I feel completely pushed aside and not really a priority. I cleaned and unpacked everything myself, I cook every meal and he wakes me up early in the morning to make his coffee and breakfast. He doesn‚Äôt sleep in our apartment every night (he says at his friends dorm to catch up on projects and homework so I‚Äôm not too mad about that) and whenever I try and communicate that I‚Äôm not feeling to well and feeling homesick I kinda just get left alone. It‚Äôs been worse this week as I genuinely felt like I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed out of depression and kindly asked if he could handle dinner that night. He proceeded to come in constantly and ask what to do step by step to the point I just got up and cooked dinner myself as he sat down to scroll on his phone, I then afterwards cleaned as he passed out on the couch. He then proceeded to not take me to visit my parents for their 40th wedding anniversary this upcoming weekend ( we live 3 hours away from them) and told me I‚Äôll be fine and passed out in bed. I feel like I‚Äôm going insane and overreacting just based off how he‚Äôs reacting to all my emotions. Am I asking for too much? If I am what‚Äôs a healthy way to communicate my feelings better to get him to understand. I‚Äôm not too familiar with long term relationships so I‚Äôm not sure what healthy looks like.

Ever felt that nagging **dread** about your career? Kind of like that moment when you realize ‚ÄúOops, my milk expired a week ago!‚Äù Yeah, that‚Äôs how I felt when I thought about my future in the AI world. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

**Let's be real**: the AI landscape is changing super fast! If you‚Äôre not on top of your game, it's like watching your career drift away on a floating log while you‚Äôre stuck on the shore... 

So, how do we stop the inevitable fade into obscurity? **Upskill NOW!** üõ†Ô∏è Because trust me, you don‚Äôt want to wake up 5 years from now wondering where all the jobs went. 

Here are a few reasons why **you should upskill like it‚Äôs your morning coffee**:

- **Stay Relevant**: Job descriptions in AI are evolving faster than I can finish a slice of pizza! üçï Skills that were hot yesterday might be ice-cold tomorrow. 
- **Network Opportunities**: Learning together (and I mean really learning) opens doors. Ever heard the phrase, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not what you know, but who you know?‚Äù Turns out, your learning buddies can become your career boosters! üöÄ 
- **Work Smarter, Not Harder**: You ever try to do something the ""old way"" and end up frustrated? New skills rewire your thinking and allow you to work more efficiently. 

Oh, and if you really want to dive deep into this upskilling thing, I found this amazing educational program that can level you up in no time: [Imagine Education AI](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). It‚Äôs got the goods to help you not only learn but thrive! 

Now, here‚Äôs where it gets even juicier: think about where you want to be in the next couple of years. üéØ 

- Do you want to be leading a team of brilliant minds?
- Or are you okay with watching others rise while you‚Äôre still stuck figuring out the basics? 

So, what are you waiting for? I know the whole ‚Äúlearning curve‚Äù can feel as steep as a rollercoaster, but trust me, there‚Äôs a thrill to it! Plus, the more you upskill, the more you‚Äôll love the ride! üé¢

I tried texting him and he didn‚Äôt answer. His mom showed up after a few days and told me he‚Äôd had a medical event related to his diabetes and they didn‚Äôt know when or if he‚Äôd be back. I pieced together through remembered conversations and shared friends and knowing him for ten years that he‚Äôd been neglecting his treatment as a suicide attempt. Replacing his sugar free coffees with the real stuff and lying about it. I thought he‚Äôd finally turned it around and was happy being him. Shows what I know. 

He came in a couple of months later in a wheelchair and he must have been under a hundred pounds. He and I shared some niceties but he could tell I was disturbed and I could tell he was ashamed. He moved back in with his parents that he hated for rejecting his gender identity because he couldn‚Äôt get around on his own at all and needed their support. Three months later he went dark on social media. I checked his mom‚Äôs facebook. He had a stroke. A big one. A ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll ever move again‚Äù one. He ends up surviving and going home. A couple days after that she‚Äôs posting asking for children‚Äôs books and tarps for furniture. He‚Äôs got intense brain damage that‚Äôs left him at a kindergarten level. Just like that the guy I met in middle school is gone. Erased. Everything he ever liked doing is out of reach and he probably doesn‚Äôt even know it. 

I saw his mom at work about a year after it happened  (I work at something like a call center but with video). She didn‚Äôt expect to see me, we had some small talk, then she tells me about his stroke. Says he‚Äôs happy. Says he likes Veggie Tales. I told her I couldn‚Äôt serve her because it was against policy to help people you know and hung up on her. I‚Äôm ashamed of how afraid I was of that conversation. I‚Äôm afraid that I could go see him again. I still have his mom‚Äôs number, I know his address. I could just ask to come see him. I‚Äôm not sure I could handle it, seeing my friend who prided himself on leaving it all behind and sticking it to his parents confined to their house with his identity taken from him. 

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting about this now. Septembers are hard because his birthday always brings him back to the front of my mind. I still think about him every day and he‚Äôs in my dreams constantly. Dreams that always make me feel like he‚Äôs back until I wake up and realize he‚Äôs still in that house. September always makes me reflect on what he‚Äôs missed. I‚Äôm married now. I have a new job, a new car, new friends. I‚Äôm a better person than I ever believed I could be when we were working retail, and I‚Äôm proud of it. I just wish he was part of it. 

Every now and then I see a picture of him on his mom‚Äôs facebook. His hair is his natural color, and it‚Äôs basic compared to what he‚Äôd go for. But he‚Äôs always smiling in those pictures. I hope he‚Äôs really happy with the life he‚Äôs been dealt. I miss you J, I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm such a coward. ",8,1758346207.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

- Filmed with an iPhone 16 Pro Max (native camera app, in LOG. But I ended up being overwhelmed with color grading so left it mostly as is with a couple of tweaks)

- Edited on LumaFusion

- i only have 1 light (super cheap, small, ring light)

- This was also my first attempt at sound design, basic as it is. 

I would be grateful to any and all feedback. Thanks in advance!

Based on my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CMAlongi_Official/comments/1nkvcee/oc_ideas_for_new_customers/) I'm going to give an update to the lore and design looks of each character as I realised I never did so before.

Mayalyn: Dragon Form: Eastern style azure dragon blue scales and a silver fur roughly 9 American school buses long, Human Form: around 8 feet tall wearing a traditional hanfu with a silver fer lining has horns and tail protruding and when angry has teeth and nails sharpen with an overall swimmers build, Personality: innocent rich girl clearly grew up wealthy but tries to not flaunt it often failing (As a child her forced now Ex-Fianc√© once turned a sushi roll alive and moving just as she swallowed it whole so she's now unable to eat it even through it's her favorite food)

Luna: Tiger Form: Roughly the size of 1 American school bus, she's a white tiger with angelic wings, Human Form: She has the skin tone of a European, other than vitiligo like blotches giving her stripes often in workout clothes very much a heavyweight boxer build, Personality: Teasing older sister very lazy but once they get going unstoppable until their worn out (Is allergic to seraphim feathers.)

Natsuha: Phoenix Form: Eastern style quail-based phoenix roughly the size of a helicopter with a fiery red plumage having a yellow accent throughout it, Human Form: wears a traditional hanfu the colour changing each day of the week in order Monday: Red, Tuesday: Orange, Wednesday: Yellow, Thursday: Green, Friday: Blue, Saturday: Indigo, Sunday: Violet always paired with a kerchief that's made from her tail plumage retained in human form hidden under the clothes paired with a gold diadem on top, Personality: Sweet and motherly with a regal vibe about them and some mystery when they speak (Loves flirting and making younger people blush in a teasing way) Retcon: Age 24 instead of 18

Yu & Wei: Turtle-Snake Form: Yu: Is a black turtle roughly the size of a tank. Wei: Is a black python wrapping several times around Yu's shell, the two connected at the base underneath the shell, conjoining them. Human Form: Their human form is of 5'6 short stack conjoined/siamese twins, Yu being the main body in charge of arms and legs, with Wei exiting from their back, similar to Gyutaro's reveal in demon slayer. Yu, being very chubby and curvy, wears lots of soft, comfy clothes or a conservative bikini with a towel wrapped around the waist. Wei is skinny and malnourished, coming out of Yu's spin just above the hips, often resting on her shoulders, having no arms and legs hiding underneath Yu's clothes, with just their head popping out or a tube top modified to be a speedo for them when they go swimming. Personality's: Yu: Soft spoken and shy, very energetic but they have narcolepsy so often sleep doesn‚Äôt eat much. Wei: A glutton eating everything in sight, often people mistake them for being mute, but they only talk once their used to people (Their nudists often not leaving the house so they can be exposed and comfortable)

Theo: Man Faced Spider Form: Their abdomen is the size of a small apartment, with the middle shrinking to be half that size with the head part being the torso of a regular human having long green hair flowing over their face with spider like pincers coming out of a human-sized mouth and 8 eyes in their head roughly as tall as a 4-story building when on all eight legs, Human? Form: a 10 ft tall twig of a person? having 4 spider legs coming out the back, keeping their spider human head, wearing a purple, green toga, Personality: Shy and skittish, very traumatized by people's reactions to them in either form, loves their lesbian mothers very dearly (Did the opposite of a gay awakening telling their parents dramatically their straight as the mothers laughed and played along like a dramatic tragedy) Retcon/add: While traveling with their mothers, they met Yukiko in Japan who they developed a slight crush on who went missing one day.

Red: Fairy Form: As mentioned, their crimson with black highlights, having long hair in a braid. Personality: Very childish and curious, often accidentally glamour themselves into animals and forget to change back unless they can see a fairy otherwise change into a new animal.

In-depth reason for being in America, and specifically the Cafae Latte area: 

Mayalyn: Visiting both the CaFae and the Stoten Street Witch Coven to see how they use the water they make. (Follows Nicole and mentally adopted them as a cousin.)

Luna: Visiting Andy (Vet Grandpa), who is her adopted great-great-great-great nephew & their cousin (Dad Side), Gabreal the seraphim. (Sleeps on top the fire station to bask in the sun showing up the the Cafae grandparents when the come in for morning coffee)

Natsuha: Visiting the USA to teach seminars on childcare and getting updated laws on child safety/endangerment in relation to magic and paranormal creatures.

Yu: Visiting their partner's 

Wei: Visiting their partners and trying American food.

Theo: They constantly produce a lethal poison and need a doctor to make a new antidote every few weeks, as both the lethality and acidity of the venom require specialised treatment not exactly legal when the doctor needs to come to the USA for ""specialised care,"" having to follow them into the city but due to mother schedule can't get them to take him over like normal so a magical object is required for them to fly over and stay like that due to USA paranormal racism. (The doctor is the one from the Cyras kidnapping incident, and Cyrus killing the witch breaks the magical object, causing them to return to monster form near the CaFae where they were staying destroying the entire building thankfully no one was hurt)

Red: Parent's teaching basics of glamour, focusing on shapeshifting themself, is taken to turn into a baby unicorn when the parents get killed by the flock. They stay transformed, staying hidden for nearly a month until a portal opens up and they escape during the wild fae portal incident, seeing a fairy (Bob) rush to them and un-transforms, remembering how, since they've seen a fairy again instead of unicorns.

  
New Oc: 

Name: Yukiko

Species: Yuki-Onna

Age: 42

Gender: She/Her

Relationship Style: Heterosexual 

Dating: Crush: Theo

Ghost Form: Takes the form of a mature woman in a kimono, depicting melting snow, pale blue skin turning into an intangible snow form on a whim to dodge attacks.

Personality: Kuudere monotone and has a slight Ara Ara aunt vibe. (Loves the warmth of cuddle piles.)

Notes: She was killed by a Man Faced Spider who died on a mountain, their poison melting the terrain making it unstable, leading to an avalanche that killed her (The Man Faced Spider is Theo's biological dad.) She often stops people from entering dangerous areas of the mountain she's trapped on. Controlling her blizzard to do so has developed a slight crush on Theo, who uses her cold and ice magic to freeze their blood, slowing the rate at which their poison becomes more virulent.

Reason for being in the USA CaFae Latte Area: She and her blizzard were captured by Krampus and trapped in a snow globe until they got released so Krampus could escape.",1,1758345367.0,CMAlongi_Official,0,1.0,False
1nlpl1z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nlpl1z,Thoughts on this? (ctto 404 Media Cell -FB),"üö® ‚Ç±6 BILLION IN CONTRACTS, CORDILLERA STYLE üö®

From 2021 to 2025, Cordillera-based contractors have landed ‚Ç±6 BILLION worth of government projects. That‚Äôs not chump change ‚Äî that‚Äôs roads, bridges, flood control, and public funds on a massive scale.

Among the names riding high is DJY Construction, led by Delia Yubos.
If her name rings a bell, that‚Äôs because she‚Äôs not just in construction ‚Äî she also owns Bloom Dish Restaurant and Hotel in Benguet.

So let‚Äôs spell it out:
üèóÔ∏è She builds roads.
üçΩÔ∏è She runs restaurants.
üõèÔ∏è She manages hotels.
Question: coincidence, competence‚Ä¶ or connections?

Because in this country, contracts of this size don‚Äôt just ‚Äúland‚Äù in anyone‚Äôs lap.
They flow through networks, bids, and signatures ‚Äî and ‚Ç±6 BILLION worth of signatures means serious influence.

Here‚Äôs what makes this story slap harder:
üîπ 2021‚Äì2025 isn‚Äôt just any timeframe. These are years of pandemic recovery, inflation, and debt. Every peso mattered.
üîπ While teachers, nurses, and farmers begged for budget, Cordillera contractors bagged billions.
üîπ And in Benguet, where basic services lag behind, one construction firm is quietly building both roads and empires.

Of course, BAC records and PHILGEPS filings will say it‚Äôs all ‚Äúabove board.‚Äù But Filipinos have learned the hard way: transparency on paper doesn‚Äôt always mean accountability on the ground.

üí° The big picture:
This isn‚Äôt just about DJY Construction or Delia Yubos. It‚Äôs about a system where contractors double as tycoons, where public infrastructure turns into private dynasties, and where ‚Ç±6B flows up while citizens look down at unfinished roads, delayed bridges, and over-budget projects.

Meanwhile, the line between business, politics, and public trust? Blurred to the point of invisible.

üî• Save this post. Because ‚Ç±6 BILLION worth of contracts isn‚Äôt just a statistic ‚Äî it‚Äôs a mirror of how power really works in the regions. And every mirror shows us one thing: infrastructure is never just about cement. It‚Äôs about who‚Äôs cashing in.

Weekends slip by faster than they should. So how about we hit pause on doomscrolling, step out of our comfort zones (and pajamas), and do something refreshingly different?

Maybe we start with a visit to a museum or art gallery‚Äîwhere we pretend to ‚Äúget‚Äù abstract art while secretly rating the frame choices and color palettes like undercover critics. From there, we wander into one of Bangalore‚Äôs greener corners or stumble through a colorful market, just soaking in the chaos or calm, depending on the mood. When our feet (or attention spans) give out, we settle into a cozy caf√© for coffee, or maybe cool off with ice cream that feels way too indulgent for the weather. 

And if the conversation‚Äôs still flowing, who knows‚Äîmaybe a spontaneous detour to a bookshop rounds off the day just right.

Original wood was a darkish brown, but did not appear to be tinted or varnished.

Its very hard and heavy... the final top weighs about 35kg. Has quite a lot of long microfissures and seems very prone to cracking. Splinters a fair bit too, even after sanding down to 320 if you run your hand over it you can feel ongoing splintering. Seems to have some borer holes that also seem a bit unusual for Australia?

Sanded to a light colour and the fine dust smelt a bit like warm sugared cocoa all the time.

One section a bit darker with much more figuring.

Key here may be that it has these crusty dark inclusions in the wood that do not appear to be fire related. Tried to photo the most interesting of these but there was a scene stealer.

Hey guys this has been an issue for quite a while but I've been having problems with my sleep. I'm a sec 4 student and before upper sec, I've always been so energetic and motivated daily. I could go a whole day without sleeping, stay up late however, and I'm always so active and would spend every second of my time well. However ever since sec 3, I've been having trouble staying awake. I could fall asleep in an instant and I'd take long naps the moment I reach home from school, which is apparently not natural? I don't even sleep late I literally sleep on the dot so I don't know why I feel so sleep deprived daily. I try my best to drink coffee but it's not helping, it's as though I've developed some kind of resistance to caffeine. To solve this, I'd drink water every 10mins during lessons to keep myself awake, thankfully it helped for a while until the month before prelims where I fell into a lot of stress that I'm back to sleeping during lessons. I remember my teacher called me out because she was genuinely concerned for my wellbeing. I'm usually the kind to actively participate and ask qns during lessons but I've been so different lately cause of exhaustion. Yesterday I drank 2 energy drinks but the moment I reached home I napped for 3hours and it took me so long to get up right after and I'm genuinely so disappointed cause I could've spent the time studying. And maybe you may think that cause I slept earlier, I won't be able to fall asleep later? Wrong. The moment I got to bed I fell asleep immediately. It's giving Lenz's law (iykyk) when I wanna sleep I can't and when I don't want to I do so immediately. I think my lifestyle's pretty healthy? although not as active as lower sec as I spend more time studying than going out to do sports and hobbies. But what I can say is that my mental health has certainly deteriorated since the start of upper sec. I started losing interest in things I love and I've been burdening myself with TYS after TYS.

I'm struggeling with power automate. :-(

I get reports in pdf format every month. But the layout is ""poor"". i have managed to figure out some PQ stages to isolate the relevant data, format the text to currency, change the (x) to -x and get the 3 pages appended together. And loaded into a 2 column table.

I then use a xlookup to pull the values for different categories (food, beverage, wages, shipping, printed materials, etc) into a new sheet.

My goal is to process each month, and inport the values into a tracking table. So i can see if labor is climbing, or coffee and tea is slumping etc. 

My first bit of trouble came when some months had new categories (freight, other-revenue, tax, etc.) I have that managed with the xlookup, and having new rows for every category i could pull from the reports.

My current problem is when i copy a new file into the ""current month.pdf"" my PQ breaks. I thought i had it working well, then i tried with a new month.

It seems like PQ breaks because the column names dont match. And this is compounded by PQ ""finding"" different columns for the data on different pages. (E.g. on page 1 column7 is category, and 9 is cost, but the query for page 2 has column6 as category, and 8 as cost)

How can i ensure i can reuse my PQ build over all months? 

 I have thought about PQ from folder, but that is 1 layer deeper than im comfortable right now, and, i dont need 48 reports all loaded into my file, constantly making the .xlms larger.

Instead of the typical selfies that show your face, Reverse Selfie Saturday invites you to share what you see.Whether it's your morning coffee view, a quiet garden corner, or just a well-worn book and a cup of tea, we want to see the world through your eyes.

The idea is simple,Point the camera away from yourself, take a picture, and tell us a little story.What's happening in front of you? What does that scene mean to you?

Why are we doing this?
Because many of us are tired of being objectified and of Reddit admins turning a blind eye‚Ä¶..We've seen messages that are clearly sexualisation and objectifying that have been reported.. these reports have either gone ignored and in some cases been approved by Reddit itself.

That's not okay.

This space should be about real connection, respect, and community not unwanted attention or inappropriate comments, especially toward users who are just trying to engage authentically.
Reverse Selfie Saturday is our way of pushing back.It‚Äôs about taking control of how we show up here, sharing life from our perspective, and creating a space where people can feel safe and seen without being seen in ways they didn‚Äôt ask for.

So this Saturday, we invite you,Show us your sunrise,Your sewing room,Your messy kitchen,Your peaceful walk,Your favorite reading spot.
And if you feel like it, tell us why that moment matters.

1nlp8qr,https://i.redd.it/rty566m029qf1.jpeg,Coffee Spots of Nagpur 1: Lush House,"Nagpur has too many coffee spots. I‚Äôm gonna start reviewing them.  
Also, drop me suggestions on where else I should go, and if you‚Äôve been to these places, tell me what you think.

‚∏ª

This week‚Äôs place: ***Lush House***

‚òïÔ∏è Coffee I tried:

* Comet -- 7/10
* Gambit -- 8/10
* Iced Americano -- 8.5/10 (‚Çπ139, also the cheapest)
* Brown Bunny ‚Äì 8/10

(Most drinks are \~‚Çπ200, so the prices aren‚Äôt crazy, but also not fully justified for what you get. Almost worth it, but not quite there.)

‚∏ª

Here‚Äôs my take:  
The highs of the coffee at Lush House aren‚Äôt sky-high, but the lows aren‚Äôt disappointing either. It‚Äôs consistent; you‚Äôll get a cup that‚Äôs good enough every single time.

*‚ÄúCoffee is a language in itself.‚Äù ‚Äì Jackie Chan*

They bring the coffee out pretty quickly, which is always a win. The staff is friendly, and the ambience works if you‚Äôre looking to spend a few hours. I actually ended up sitting there for four hours without realizing. Most of the crowd is either people on laptops or folks smoking with their coffee.

Speaking of which, if you smoke, the guard Tiwari ji has basically turned into part of the Lush House experience. At this point, he remembers my cigarette preference.

The music can get a little loud and repetitive, but not enough to ruin the vibe. Location-wise, it‚Äôs right in Abhyankar Nagar, so pretty central and easy to get to.

One thing I noticed: with every sip, the coffee felt a little less tasty and interesting. Especially with the iced drinks, as the ice melts, the coffee slowly loses its essence and becomes flatter.

Overall, it‚Äôs a great spot if you work from home and need a change of scenery. The coffee may be slightly overpriced for what it is, but you‚Äôll always get a decent cup, and the space is comfortable enough to park yourself for hours.

How to nip it in the bud?,"TLDR: I strongly suspect a (30F) coworker has developed feelings for me out of the blue, and I want some tips in terms of how to shut it down since she's married and I'm gay.

Hey there, so I am a 35 year old gay male who works a white collar job in an office. Recently, I developed a casual office friendship with one of my female coworkers. She's around my age, and she's pretty fun to talk to. We get along well. 

Now my friendship with her is only about a few weeks to a little over a month old at this point. It's been almost entirely confined to the office. The only time I've ever hung out with her outside of work was meeting with her for coffee last Saturday. We spent a little over an hour just talking then parted ways. At the office our friendship mainly consists of me stopping by her desk for about 30 minutes during the morning time just to chit chat before the day gets going. She may send me a few IMs throughout the day, but that's about it. Honestly, she's not even the person I talk to the most at the office. We work in different divisions within the larger directorate so she's within close proximity to me, but isn't a direct neighbor.

On many occasions, she's mentioned she's married with a husband who she has a good relationship. She's indicated no inclination to cheat on her husband. Moreover, she's indicated no dissatisfaction with her marriage. Finally she knows I'm gay and am not interested in women.

Okay that context out of the way, let's get to the actual situation. So yesterday, me and her just so happened to arrive at the parking lot of our job around the same time. She waved to me and I waved back. We started walking towards the office and literally the first thing she said to me was, ""Hey \_\_\_, I was just thinking about you last night. I just really like you. You're so sweet."" Now mind you she did not say all this with a flat tone; it was said with plenty of....feeling and enthusiasm. It was said almost as if the sentiments were bursting out of her and she was excited to express them. 

It took her only a few seconds to say all this, but from the moment she did it floored me. I don't even remember exactly how I responded. I, however, know I tried to brush it aside with something like, ""Oh that's nice or Oh thanks."" It was something so out of left field that I didn't know how to respond. Outwardly I tried to be cool but inwardly I was like ""What the fuck? Did she just say that?""

For the rest of the workday, my mind would occasionally drift back to what she said. I would ask myself questions like, ""Okay did she actually say what I think she said, and if so did she actually mean what my instincts are telling me I think she means."" I tried really hard to come up with some innocent, platonic justification for her to say she was ""Thinking about me"", but I felt like I was stretching credulity. Unrelated to the whole situation, I called sick to work the day after. Towards the end of the workday she sent me a text basically saying with a sad emoji that she missed me at work. 

Okay so at this point here's what I need advice about. 

First, is there any reasonable platonic way to interpret what she said to me that morning

If not then can the friendship be salvaged? To be honest right now I'm feeling pretty uncomfortable and awkward about my friendship with her. She's married and I'm gay, and I just really do not want anything romantic or serious with her. Moreover, even if she did meant what she said in a platonic way it still sounded way too awkward and....strong for my taste. I would just like advice on how to address it with her. Anyhow thanks guys. Please let me know if you need more clarification.",2,1758343518.0,relationship_advice,14,0.75,False

Talking is what makes or breaks the date. I don‚Äôt try to plan a script but I stay curious and ask about their interests hobbies or even favorite food spots. The key is really listening because that shows you care way more than trying to sound impressive



I also remind myself not to expect some movie level moment. A first date is just to see if you click with someone. Being open minded and genuine usually takes the pressure off and makes the time together feel more natural



And of course safety is huge. I always meet in a public spot let a friend know where I am and trust my gut if something feels off. When the date feels safe and easy it‚Äôs a lot more likely you‚Äôll actually want to see each other again

*Where the CFL‚Äôs drama meets DraftKings‚Äô spreads like a breakup in a Tim Hortons parking lot*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: A Numbers Showdown

Let‚Äôs start with the cold, hard math. The BC Lions are favored across the board, but the spreads are all over the map. DraftKings lists them at -21.5, Bovada at -4.0, and BetMGM absurdly at -28.5 (which might as well be ‚ÄúBC wins by eating the scoreboard‚Äù). The moneyline tells a clearer story: BC at **2.85 odds** (35% implied probability) vs. Calgary at **1.44** (69% implied). Why the chaos? Likely because bookmakers are spooked by Vernon Adams Jr.‚Äôs injury but also terrified of Nathan Rourke‚Äôs *record-breaking 3,604 yards* and his habit of scoring rushing touchdowns like they‚Äôre free Timbits.

The total line? A split-screen nightmare. DraftKings says **Over/Under 68.5** (1.87 odds), while Bovada lowballs it to **55.5** (1.91). If you‚Äôre betting Over, you‚Äôre banking on Rourke‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôll score with my legs, my arms, and my *enthusiasm*‚Äù energy. Under? Well, Calgary‚Äôs backup QB, P.J. Walker, has the arm strength of a man who‚Äôs never met a coffee cup.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Records, and a Circus Acrobatic Goalie

The BC Lions are riding a **two-way juggernaut** in Nathan Rourke, who just shattered Russ Jackson‚Äôs single-season passing-yard record. His 3,604 yards? That‚Äôs enough to circle the Earth if you ignore the curvature. Add in **381 rushing yards and 4 TDs**, and Rourke is basically a Swiss Army knife with a helmet.

Calgary‚Äôs plight? Vernon Adams Jr., their QB, got kneed in the back of the head like a rogue soccer mom during his first game back from injury. Now they‚Äôre relying on P.J. Walker, who‚Äôs less ‚ÄúPro Bowl‚Äù and more ‚Äúguy who once won a office draft pool by default.‚Äù Adams‚Äô absence is a plot hole: Without him, Calgary‚Äôs of

It‚Äôs a male dominated field and there‚Äôs only 2 girls including myself. The girl works different days so I don‚Äôt ever see her. Now onto the bullying, I tried being nice to them, talking to them, I even bought them lunch multiple times. They always mad rude comments, but I figured they didn‚Äôt mean it the way it came out.  Besides me finding out from other members that they talk shit about me, at first I didint speak too much to them because I was new and I was trying to get my work done. Therefore they thought I was werid and slow and now that I do talk to them they act nice to my face and do things behind my back. One had left me a cup of coffee in my desk and told me they found out how much I liked it. I was actually so excited, I thought we might become friendly, (I had never had a full conversation with him) so I thought this was a friendly gesture. The mug handle had a werid sauce on it and my hands were all dirty, that‚Äôs when I realized it was a prank. I just ignore them now but I can‚Äôt fully ignore them. I didn‚Äôt want to tell my supervisor because I‚Äôm only here two months, I also didn‚Äôt want to be a snitch in a sense but honestly I‚Äôm so over it like the things they do while at work are highly against policy and I can easily get them fired. Should I just thug it out, we‚Äôre all stuck here 2 months and then I go back to my normal department and never have to see them again. 

They also act like immature boys so talking to them about how I feel is a big no.

I am polite and cordial with everyone but I do not go beyond that with my female collegues. No long chats no hanging out after work no sharing personal life details. I just feel more comfortable keeping things formal and work focused. I greet them wish them well join in meetings but I dont want to be texting them regarding anything above and beyond work or going for casual coffee. 

Some people at work have told me I come across as too formal .A female collegue even joked that I come across to her as a robot with prompts of formal cordiality even though we have worked together for over a year. I do not mean to insult anyone and I respect all of them but I honestly think it avoids alot of confusion or misreading of intentions. I am not hostile just professional. 

Still some of them think I am being immature and antisocial. I ain't judging those who can do the opposite , infact they will be very great people mainting a social chord without hesitations regarding gender and all which sound superficial on paper  but should the inability to do so should be judged as something wrong instead of a normal prefernce ? 

 So AITA for drawing this line and keeping my interactions strictly professional with opposite sex collegues

I never wanted to cheat on my old lady, Ori, but...there is always a but.","My ex-girlfriend Lucille came back to me. Then we had intercourse in the club soon after.

When it was all over, I realized it was a huge mistake.

She was lying next to me, awakening, snapping me out of the depressed state I had placed myself in. ‚ÄúBabe, why are you up so early? Is it time for you to go?‚Äù

The feel of her hand touching my back felt like a cast-iron branding my skin, causing me to jump up.

We crossed a line that shouldn‚Äôt have ever been crossed.

Though she was beautiful, she wasn‚Äôt my Ori, and I gave her a piece of me that didn‚Äôt belong to her.

Sitting up, she let the sheet puddle around her waist, giving me one last view of her succulent breasts.

‚ÄúWill you call me? I can meet you whenever she isn‚Äôt around?‚Äù She begged.

Immediately, the guilt plagued me.

I couldn‚Äôt lose my world over one mistake.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî





Ash

I end the call and shove the phone in my pocket. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I ask, shrugging at Zane.

‚ÄúThe great Asher Hammond has fallen.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. The first thing you do when you arrive here is call your girl? ‚Äù

‚ÄúI let her know I‚Äôm alive. She‚Äôs collecting our mail and watching over Black Lotus while we‚Äôre gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sure that‚Äôs all it is, Little One?‚Äù Zane asks, barely able to contain his amusement.

I didn‚Äôt realize he heard my pet name for Ori. Apparently, he heard every word.

‚ÄúLeave him alone,‚Äù Braden interjects. ‚ÄúLooks like it will just be the two of us playing with the bunnies this year.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there,‚Äù I insist, my gaze volleying between them.

‚ÄúSure you will,‚Äù they reply in stereo.

So glad they‚Äôre enjoying this torture.

With a roll of my eyes, I push myself to a standing position. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back. I saw a vendor at the entrance that I want to check out.‚Äù

What I need is to get out of this uncomfortable conversation and the implications they seem intent on making about Ori and me.

There is no Ori and me. We‚Äôre just friends with the best benefits on the planet.

End of story.

Does that mean I‚Äôll take advantage of our status to sleep with some gorgeous, nameless women this year?

After hearing her voice, we all know the answer to that one, but it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm not free to do so.

I‚Äôm just not feeling it this time.

I stroll to a booth by the entrance of the convention center, run by a husband and wife duo who create tattoo designed book covers for the classics‚Äîa brilliant idea that I might have to put into play at Black Lotus.

Ori and I could team up, with me creating the covers and her selling them in One More Page.

Teamwork and all that jazz.

But that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm here now.

Ori‚Äôs favorite book is Jane Eyre, which she divulged during our first night together. The woman is a diehard romantic, especially with the concept of true love overcoming all. She stands in direct opposition to my fierce beliefs about happily ever after.

But this isn‚Äôt for me. It‚Äôs for her, a token of appreciation for helping my dreams come true.

This booth has a copy of Jane Eyre, and it‚Äôs exquisitely crafted, too. The dark color palette highlights a portrait of Jane in the center, with the gothic spires of Thornfield Manor behind her.

It‚Äôs a perfect addition to Ori‚Äôs collection of classics.

I grab my purchase and receipt before returning to our booth, thrilled I snagged a copy before they sold out.

But that happiness is short-lived because something is different, and I detect it the moment I step back into Black Lotus‚Äôs booth.

My brother, so happy-go-lucky not ten minutes earlier, now wears a petulant scowl.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter? Did something break?‚Äù I ask, glancing around the booth.

See, that‚Äôs not unusual during a convention. Things get lost, broken, stolen, or any combination of the above, and it always makes the job tougher.

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù Braden mutters, moving his cases from one table to another with excessive force.

‚ÄúWhat am I missing?‚Äù

Braden pauses, his mouth turned down in a frown. ‚ÄúAre you a glutton for punishment?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

He jabs a finger toward a young woman standing not three feet outside our booth.

‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù I know I‚Äôve never seen the woman before, no matter what she claims.

‚ÄúYour first client.‚Äù

I scrub my hands over my face, trying to deduce why this is pissing my brother off. ‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a collab piece, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I spoke with Scott at Steel and Stain about a month ago. The client approved my design, and Scott will work on the piece with me. He‚Äôs a genius with dotwork, and that‚Äôs what the client wanted as a border to her main ink. I don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôre mad. Did you want in on the collab?‚Äù

Braden walks over, pulling off his baseball cap and tugging a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúScott is in the hospital with appendicitis.‚Äù

I shoot another glance at the client, offering her a reassuring smile and a slight wave of my hand. ‚ÄúOkay. I‚Äôll do my part of the design, and she‚Äôll have to see Scott when he‚Äôs out of the hospital.‚Äù

Braden shakes his head, the frustration seeping from his pores. ‚ÄúScott sent another artist in his stead. One who‚Äôs equally brilliant with dotwork.‚Äù

I nod slowly, trying to deduce what I‚Äôm missing in this puzzle. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome, then. Who did he send?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour worst nightmare,‚Äù Braden grits out.

What is he talking about?

‚ÄúHe means me,‚Äù a gritty female voice says behind me.

I freeze as an ice-cold thrill shoots through me.

It can‚Äôt be.

There‚Äôs no way.

It‚Äôs been three years since I‚Äôve last seen her and we agreed then to do our damnedest to avoid one another.

Sucking in a deep breath, I turn on my heel and face my nemesis.

The woman stands nearly my height in her knee-high stiletto boots, her curves wrapped in tight leather pants and a bustier. Her bright pink hair falls down her back and her bright blue eyes see right through me.

A hint of a smile plays on her full lips as she glides her tongue along her lip piercing, her tattoo bag slung over one shoulder.

No one would know it to look at her, but she‚Äôs poison.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, she‚Äôs also beautiful, but she‚Äôs deadly on every level.

I should know.

‚ÄúScott sent you?‚Äù I grit out the words, feeling the bile rise in my throat. Seems like that black coffee might make another appearance all over her boots.

She nods as a smile breaks across her face. ‚ÄúKismet, I guess. It‚Äôs been a while, Ash. Too long.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot long enough,‚Äù I grumble, feeling my insides twist at her proximity.

She motions to the bag in my hand. ‚ÄúWhat did you buy?‚Äù

We are not engaging in small talk.

I prepare to reply with a caustic retort, but I notice my client is within earshot. Correction: our client.

I pull the book from the bag and thrust it toward her. ‚ÄúJane Eyre.‚Äù

She examines the cover, her long nails tracing the artwork. ‚ÄúGorgeous. But you‚Äôre not a fan of Jane Eyre. So tell me, who is she?‚Äù She cocks her head at me, her eyes wide and teasing.

‚ÄúNope, I‚Äôm not doing this.‚Äù I stalk into Black Lotus‚Äôs booth, trying to regain my balance.

Just when things were looking up.

Her boots click against the floor as she trails me to my station. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre stuck working together, Ash, so can we make the best of it?‚Äù

Is she insane? I keep my back to her, willing my breathing to return to normal.

‚ÄúLook, I know you hate me, but‚Å†‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know nothing about me,‚Äù I snarl.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true. I know everything about you.‚Äù

Whirling on my heel, I fix her with my glare. ‚ÄúWhy are you here? And don‚Äôt tell me Scott sent you. You could have said no. You should have said no.‚Äù

She inches forward, her normally confident movements now timid. ‚ÄúI thought it would be a great opportunity.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor us.‚Äù

She‚Äôs got to be kidding me. My brain thumps in my head, and I swear I‚Äôm going to stroke out. Maybe that‚Äôs a good idea to get me away from this situation.

Ten years. Ten years and I‚Äôm still not past her. Still not past the lies and betrayal she heaped on my love.

Her hand touches my sleeve, and I yank it from her grasp. ‚ÄúAsh, please.‚Äù

Tugging a hand through my hair, I finally meet her gaze. ‚ÄúWhat do you want, Lucille?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnother chance so that maybe you might like me again. Remember any of my good qualities.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you have any?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know I do, although I deserved that comment.‚Äù She averts her gaze, fiddling with the arm of the portable tattoo chair. ‚ÄúI should go. I‚Äôll call Scott and let him know this was a bad idea. You want me to speak to the client?‚Äù

Lucille is offering me a way out, but how can I let this client down when I know her backstory? She flew five hundred miles for me to ink her dead fianc√© on her skin. Correction: she flew hundreds of miles for Lucille and me to work together on this piece.

I know Lucille‚Äôs skill and she‚Äôll do an exemplary job on the tattoo.

Trouble is, she might decimate my soul in the process.

Again.

You‚Äôre a professional, Ash. You can do this. You survived Lucille once. How hard can it be this time?

.....

Ori

Screwing men.

At this moment, that derisive thought is aimed solely at my infuriatingly attractive, tattooed neighbor.

A neighbor who a week ago promised me dinner‚Äîand dessert‚Äîbut has yet to deliver on either.

I get it, or at least the rational side of my brain does.

Ash is busy with business, and keeping his clientele happy at Black Lotus keeps the lights on in his upscale tattoo parlor. Plus, these aren‚Äôt just any clients.

How do I know? Ash told me earlier today when he begged off our plans yet again. These women are not random inked hotties, desperate for some face time with Sparkwood‚Äôs resident bad boy.

They‚Äôre scouts for a major magazine.

Major, as in life-changing.

Ash needs to take this meeting, so our dinner date needs to simmer on the back burner while I stew next door.

The worst part? I hate being this way. I‚Äôm not the woman who gets all tangled up in fuzzy feelings because a man delivers an over-the-top climax‚Äîor several.

I‚Äôm the chick who plays it cool. No man gets under my skin, making me all hot and bothered.

No man until Asher Hammond, that is.

He‚Äôs the first man I can‚Äôt get out of my brain, and apparently, can‚Äôt get back into bed.

Unacceptable.

Oriana Thorne does not go down like this.

Fine, I‚Äôm being a bit dramatic. It‚Äôs only been ten days since Ash and I hooked up for a second time, right before he jetted off to Vegas for a tattoo convention. From the photos I saw online, there was a whole lot of partying and a craps ton of eligible females. Talk about some low-hanging fruit. The men of Black Lotus had a never ending buffet of beauties surrounding them.

In. Every. Photograph.

Do I want to know how many of them Ash bedded during those five days? No, because where that tattooed god is concerned, ignorance is bliss.

So, when Ash got home four days ago, I was champing at the bit to go out on a real live date. He seemed happy to see me, even brought me back a special edition copy of Jane Eyre with a custom drawn cover‚Äîall because he knows it‚Äôs my favorite book. Then he informed me he was crazy busy playing catch-up, but we would have dinner together the following day.

That day came and went, along with a few others, and here we are.

I need a lobotomy.

I should be doing a million things, but here I am, leaning on the bookstore counter and straining to glimpse this evening‚Äôs entertainment like some love-starved voyeur.

Am I in love with Ash? No, with a capital N. But I am in like. Big time like. Those very fuzzy feelings I swore I would never catch around him? I have them bad.

And that isn‚Äôt good. Especially not with a man like Asher Hammond.

Too bad my heart doesn‚Äôt care what my brain thinks about the subject.

A flurry of movement in my periphery catches my attention, and I swing my gaze to watch as three women, clad in little more than lingerie, approach the entrance to Black Lotus.

They must be the magazine scouts, and of course, they have to be hot. They each possess an edgy appeal, but one is obviously the leader. Her skin is decorated with colorful ink, and her hair is styled into a long, vibrant purple mohawk. On me, that hairstyle would look ridiculous. On her, it‚Äôs stunning‚Äîand I silently curse her and her future offspring under my breath.

See? This is why the idea of love with a man like Asher Hammond is not a good look for me. I apparently descend into madness‚Äîwith little hope of escape.

I pause, realizing I‚Äôve used the word love and Ash in conjunction one too many times for it to be a coincidence.

No, no, no. Get a grip, Oriana. Right now. You will not fall in love with a man incapable of the emotion.

Nope, I don‚Äôt believe me, either.

From my perch behind the bookstore counter, I watch Ash saunter to the entrance of Black Lotus to greet the women, his intercourse-on-a-stick smirk at the ready.

When you‚Äôve got it, flaunt it, and Asher Hammond has it all in spades.

I hate him for always looking so charming, even though he‚Äôs nothing like my usual type. Seems my hormones don‚Äôt give a flying fig if I normally gravitate toward businessmen.

But he‚Äôs more than just wildly attractive. He‚Äôs smart and pensive, with a quick wit and a reading habit that puts mine to shame. He‚Äôs also the most talented lay I‚Äôve ever had, and trust me, he‚Äôs had some competition.

Sunday school teacher, I am not, but my reputation pales compared to Asher Hammond‚Äôs.

Every woman Ash wants, he gets. That‚Äôs not some egotistical aside that he spouts for effect. It‚Äôs a fact. Just ask the women of Sparkwood‚Äîthe man is a legend.

If I were smart, I would forget this cockamamie idea of dating Asher Hammond and focus on easier prey. I‚Äôve had more than my share of requests for dates, but I‚Äôve turned them all down.

I don‚Äôt date for sport. In truth, I don‚Äôt date. Who has the time? My bookstore, One More Page, keeps me hopping and now I‚Äôve added a fixer-upper mansion to my to-do list‚Äîjust for kicks.

Plus, I have a vibrator. A good one, too.

Not Asher Hammond good, though.

No one, and I mean no one, is that good.

That‚Äôs the crux of my issue‚Äîhe checks all the boxes. Everything I‚Äôve ever wanted in a man, lover, life partner ‚Ä¶ dare I say, husband, he possesses, with one tiny flaw.

He doesn‚Äôt believe in love or romance. Just ask him and he‚Äôll tell you all about it.

See? I should run for the hills and chalk up our two nights together to one too many whiskeys and one too few beds.

That‚Äôs what a smart woman would do.

That‚Äôs what I should do, but my brain cells have flitted away into the ether and it‚Äôs all Ash‚Äôs fault.

Like I said, screwing men.

A peal of laughter, tinged with one too many cocktails, sounds from next door, pulling me from my self-imposed torment. I shift my attention back to Ash and his female companions, still lingering by the tattoo parlor door. As if on cue, the leader of the lingerie pack tosses her head back with a gleeful giggle, her hand resting on Ash‚Äôs biceps.

He obviously told her something wildly witty and funny.
